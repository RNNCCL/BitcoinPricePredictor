In the interview Krugman is clearly asked a loaded question that asserts that rates are "artificially low". He points out quite correctly that without full employment or meaningful inflation there is no basis for saying the interest rates are low. To the extent he says anything controversial, it is in his belief that fiscal policy (spending money) is preferable to monetary policy (giving it to banks) in a low-growth environment. That said, I suspect most members of this community are irritated at the banking sector enough to agree that they haven\'t exactly been translating quantitative easing into the sort of public lending that could bring the economy back to full employment.\n\nAs far as the last bit goes, I personally think Krugman is wrong on bitcoin, but not because of anything he says about it and I\'m glad to see he is keeping an open mind.

Close to 2 million dollars of bitcoin is produced and over-time on average something close to that amount is sold on a daily basis. That's a huge amount of price pressure downwards. Still the price is stable, because there's an equal amount (seemingly) of new demand pouring in, likely from the trickle of new adopters and new users that jump on the bandwagon given bitcoin's benefits and a rapidly growing number of properly ran startup companies.\n\nSo what would happen if that downward pressure would be halved, but the amount of user growth remains the same. The price would surely go up slowly over time. \n\nThe expectation that this will happen will also lead to some demand as an investment opportunity, causing the price to rise a little bit faster than it ought to, and knowledge of this small boom will drive in even more money temporarily.\n\nSo I think we'll have a small bubble (e.g. 50% up) then a smaller crash (e.g. 25% down), and then a slight and steady growth. Just made those numbers up for illustration.\n\nMining investment will naturally take a hit denominated in bitcoin. Obviously, where people would be willing to invest nearly 1 bitcoin to earn 1 bitcoin, if they can now earn 0.5 bitcoin, they will only spend nearly 0.5 bitcoin on mining investments, on average.\n\nBut it's likely that the dollar price of bitcoins will be higher by the 2016 halving, and will jump up a bit due to the lower inflation, so dollar investments will likely be up, and as mining becomes more efficient, hashpower will be massively up regardless.\n\nHopefully by then we'll also see at least an order of magnitude more transactions, taking the mining reward from tx fees up to 2.5%, which relatively due to the halving will then represent 5% of the total reward (where it is a measly 0.25% today).
