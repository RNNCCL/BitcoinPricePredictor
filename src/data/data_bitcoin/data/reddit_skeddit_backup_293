Part of that involves running EVERYTHING over Tor. As was discussed again recently in here, that is inherently unsafe when you are exiting Tor before hitting the Electrum server. You are not supposed to trust the exit nodes.\n\nSo to combat that, look for services that exist only inside the Tor network. Here's an example Electrum server that resides inside the network which, as I understand it, is much safer than hitting Electrum after a Tor exit node.

The interest rate is only the interest rate the banks charge each other to borrow from each other and from depositors as well. The dollar became less valuable because the Fed both lowered interest rates (meaning bank wouldn\'t have to pay depositors) and pumped digital funny money into the banks. When the interest rate does go up it means banks will have to pay money to each other and depositors to borrow which is a quasi way of limiting the money supply in turn limiting the money supply and lower the inflation rate.\n\nThe reason the interest rate even matters is because of how money is created in the fraction reserve system. Money is debt and all forms of borrowing creates debt. Hence, all borrowing creates money. If you take out a mortgage for $100,000 you instantly created $100,000 out of thin air by creating a debt. When you pay off that $100,000 or you default on the loan you just eliminated $100,000 out of the money supply.\n\nBy increasing the interest rate it means it cost borrowers more money to borrow. So, less borrowing happens. Less money is created, the money supply starts to reverse, inflation goes down. \n\nIf the market is barely function at 0% interest rates and needs $85 billion "assistance" from the Fed every month then raising the interest rate would lead to deflation rather quickly.': 3}, ('Anyone running a full node for their apps/websites?

Of course, if you have large amounts, you definitely don\'t want all of that easily linkable to you via a simple look at the blockchain, because otherwise even illegal extortionists can steal from you, besides the government.

But here\'s some thoughts.\n\nFirst, some observations regarding ways it\'ll impact the current situation/distribution of unspent outputs, and ways to recover funds on top of a broken algorithm:\n\n1. Many existing/old unspent outputs are of the pay-to-pubkey variety, meaning they have their public key exposed.\n\n2. Addresses that are being reused (ie. have been spent previously) also have their public key exposed and at least one signature.\n\n3. An unspent pay-to-pubkey-hash output is secure in that the pubkey is hashed (harder to compromise), but will have their public key exposed when that output is being spent, in which case there\'s still a (considerable) vulnerability so long as the spending transaction hasn\'t been sufficiently confirmed.\n\n---\n\nI believe there\'s 4 general ways ECDSA can be broken (to be clearer, I don\'t believe any of these ways are disproven, and I\'m unaware of any other ways - barring R leakage/reuse because I don\'t consider that broken):\n\n1. The private key may be derived from the public key (terrible)\n2. The private key may be derived from a signature (terrible, but not as terrible)\n3. A signature may be forged from the public key (bad, but not terrible)\n4. A signature may be forged from another signature (bad, but far from terrible)\n\nSome of these have possibilities for allowing us to recover funds to the rightful owner.\n\nIn option 1. We\'d be fucked. We could opt to make all outputs for which the public key is known unspendable through a soft fork. This would keep the funds from being stolen, but also prohibits the legitimate owner from accessing it. Effectively, we\'d be destroying a fair deal of the economy.\n\nThis (demurrage) would be controversial - but considering the alternative it might be the lesser of evils:\n\nhttps://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Prohibited_changes\n\n> Demurrage (deletion or reassignment of coins judged to be "lost" or "unused"). This is highly controversial in the context of currency units; on the other hand it is absolutely essential for namespace entries like Namecoin (which implements Demurrage for namespace entries but not for currency units).\n\nFor pay-to-pubkey-hash outputs (for which the address hasn\'t been reused) we could still recover the funds with some trickery. First, freeze all pay-to-pubkey-hash outputs in a softfork, then require owners of funds to publish a commitment in which they prove they own the private key (basically, just sign a desired output script (or its hash) and stick it in an OP_RETURN output or something). Then, after sufficient confirmations on the commitment, they spend their pay-to-pubkey-hash output in which they reference that commitment - this spend would only be valid if the output and signature in the commitment matches. That\'d fix double-spending a pay-to-pubkey-hash spend as the network transitions to a new system. But it\'s ugly.\n\nIn option 2. We\'d also be fucked. The demurrage option may still be used, but restricted to apply only to reused addresses. Unspent outputs for which the public key is known may also be recovered using the above commitment scheme.\n\nIn option 3 and 4. We could recover all funds by freezing all outputs it affects (reused addresses and/or pubkey exposed addresses) and using the commitment scheme. Except instead of committing a signature, you\'d be leaking the actual private key into the commitment - as in this case the signatures would be compromised.\n\n----\n\nAs for actual migration to another signature algorithm.\n\nThis would actually be rather trivial I believe. By simply adding extra behaviour to the OP_CHECKSIG operation (or using a placeholder opcode) and using that in a soft-forkable output template to do a Schnorr signature check rather than a secp256k1 one, we\'d be done.

': 0, 'Blockchain space is limited, if everybody tries to do their transactions directly on the blockchain the cost per transaction will quickly become prohibitive and only the most high margin transactions will get in in reasonable time.\n\nCurrently the blockchain allows for approx 4 transactions per second, which is tiny for a global platform. If you multiply this, say, 10 fold, you make it prohibitively expensive to run a node in most parts of the world, causing a concentration of nodes in businesses and a few nations. This is hazardous for Bitcoin\'s decentralisation and neutrality. And on top of that, it will still get you nowhere near the point that capacity is not a problem (40 tx/s is still tiny, 4000 tx/s is still tiny). So basically it\'s following a mythical beast into Nowhereland where Bitcoin is pointless and you lost the characteristics that you did have in pursuit of others that you couldn\'t possibly get that way.\n\nThat\'s why there\'s a lot of focus in scaling Bitcoin by means of offloading transactions from the blockchain. You\'ll hear a lot about smart contracts, sidechains, payment channels, Lightning Network, treechains, etc. These are decentralised solutions, because centralised solutions for trading Bitcoin off-chain exist since long ago and for the majority of Bitcoin\'s history they account for most traffic (exchanges, trading platforms, wallets with internal trading capabilities).\n\n\nFrom another comment:\n> more apps --> more users --> more bitcoins needed --> higher demand creates higher prices\n\n> Seems fairly logical.\n\nI quote from an [earlier comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3kchtl/what_keeps_driving_the_bitcoin_price_down_even_as/cuwkrc7?context=3) in a different thread.\n>There\'s this misguided notion that having Bitcoin work as a micropayments channel will somehow drive the price up. Putting an arse penny in and then out of the system does nothing for Bitcoin other than wasting resources, unless this brought a new "hodler" in, which won\'t be the case if he\'s merely using some start-up doing everything transparently in the background. As a means of promotion of the protocol and its direct usage if you will ("be your own bank"), but that basically stopped happening long ago, and instead it\'s now discouraged.\n\n>Also, adoption is not measurable in transactions any more than it\'s measurable in valuation for instance. There are people introducing transactions for reasons as various as raffles, games, messages, market indicators, "stress tests", etc which absolutely don\'t represent user numbers and bloat the chain significantly. Most importantly, current users doing microtransactions many more times rather than sensible transactions also appear to be "more users" if you consider this a valid metric on its own.\n\n>What drives price up is demand for the coins themselves not usage of the blockchain "for anything". Also note that not all scenarios that Bitcoin is useful and super-popular drive the price up.\nA lot of people hate being told and try to silence these self-evident facts.\n\nAdoption absolutely doesn\'t need to drive price up. Only adoption of Bitcoin as a means of store of value does, not as a payment channel. What\'s more, Bitcoin\'s main blockchain as a micropayment channel is resource-depleting and damaging for the system.\n\nAbove convenience, which is also important, are:\n\n- anonymity/pseudonimity\n- neutrality from governments and financial corporations\n- decentralisation as a means of guaranteeing and defending the above': 1, "Bitcoin is already a settlement layer.

And again, if your attack against miners is to create large blocks that take a long time to propagate to them, giving you the heeadstart in mining the next block, it goes the other way too, where every bit of delay in getting your block to the network means another miner could have gotten theirs propagated and built off of first.

They could restrict block sizes to increase fees and prevent automatic increases.\n\nGood point, maybe finding a way miners are forced to include transactions in their bloks. This way they can't game the system down. This seems viable now because transactions have not much value to the miners. They get their profit from the rewards. Once this changes gaming this system will become expensive (both ways, up or down)\n\nWe could force to include transactions by not excepting their blocks if a certain % of the transactions in the mempool aren't included based on the block creating time. Not sure this is safe, but something forcing the inclusion of transaction solves a part of the gamebility of this kind of system.\n\nFeedback bases seems like the way to go for me, but indeed you have the problem you need to make it gaming resistant.
