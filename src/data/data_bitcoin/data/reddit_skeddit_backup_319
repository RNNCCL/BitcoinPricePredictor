You can reliably attack SPV clients with 35% of the hashpower if you're willing to wait until you have a sufficiently long chain, you cannot do that reliably when attacking full nodes. I started explaining the ability to attack multiple entities in order to succinctly convey that attacking SPV vs fullnodes are materially different -- perhaps it was a roundabout way to explain things, to clarify, in the latter the attacker is doing a reorg, in the former the attacker is lying about the UTXO set.": 3, "I see this meme being used more and more ... That spv is inherently insecure and that you are trusting other people not to defraud you. Either I'm totally missing something or people pushing this meme are being extremely dishonest.\n\nAs I replied on the mailing list... The situation he refers to consists of an attacker Sybil attacking an spv client and feeding it fake headers in an attempt to defraud it. Since the spv client isn't validating the blocks, it won't know the headers are invalid. \n\nBut any attacker that has enough hashing power to create a chain of 6 or 10 headers to defraud an spv client, also has enough hashing power to create 6 or 10 valid blocks and defraud a full node (this is also neglecting to mention that the probability of either attack is negligible)\n\nI fail to see how the spv client is more vulnerable than a full node to an attacker with a non-trivial amount of hashing power. Am I missing something or is this meme just attempt to be manipulative and influence the blocksize debate?": 5, "How *dare* you slang your vile racist taunts? I'll put a *chink* in your armor! En garde!": 4, 'Oh, I have no idea really. In fact, I\'m pretty sure Todd is not saying that, just pointing out an already existing attack and a couple different ways to mitigate it (one by breaking "hearn style" also sometimes called "lite" SPV wallets in their existing form - more than they already are). 0-day accounts who post from bitcoin-dev to reddit often title their posts "creatively."': 1, "OK I'm still not understanding then. In both cases, whether a reorg or lying about the utxo set, the attacker needs to build a chain that is at least long enough to cover how ever many confirmations the victim is waiting for. (And he needs to somehow do this fast enough that the victim doesn't get suspicious, i.e. it's taking 10 hours for 6 confirmations). \n\n> You can reliably attack SPV clients with 35% of the hashpower if you're willing to wait until you have a sufficiently long chain\n\nI don't get what you mean by that. Could you not do the same with a full node at any % hash power (again as long as you can some how do it fast enough to not raise suspicion)?\n\nI see the difference between lying about the utxo set vs doing a reorg, but my original point was both cases take the same amount of hashing power (though in the spv case the attacker need not own the coins first). ": 1, 'I answered the question on the mailing list here:\n\n[https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2015-August/010347.html](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2015-August/010347.html)\n\nTL;DR: Attacking full nodes requires over 51% of hashpower and tons of cash. Attacking the way SPV validation is currently used today is (substantially) below that and allows you to attack more people/coins at once.': 5, "I used to disagree with Todd all the time, but that was my fault. He is very good at finding chinks in Bitcoin's armor and bringing them to attention by making them way more obvious. For some reason, people really hate him for that, but it also makes him really valuable to have around (I know of no other dev that fills that role quite as well). Be glad he's not really Bitcoin's enemy.\n\n/u/petertodd Would you be gracious enough to translate this into non-dev speak?": 18, 'I read it through, but I am not quite clear what OP means by the title. It seems like Peter is expressing concern that SPV wallets could be spoofed. Which part of the message in particular are you referring to ?': 9, 'The second to last paragraph has something about introducing "fire drills" by embedding a block with two separate merkle trees in it. A miner would have to know which merkle tree was actually valid before it could build onto that block (otherwise it would be wrong 50% of the time). This would help keep not-really-validating miners (so-called "SPV" miner) from being hijacked to serve as a pawn to attack "not full node" "hearn-style" SPV wallets. I think.\n\nHopefully Todd can explain it better.': 6, "I know you aren't, I'm referring to Todd's post... \n\n> Ultimately, Hearn-style SPV is a close approximation to just trusting\nanyone with a non-trivial amount of hashing power. (and getting that is\nsurprisingly easy, e.g. w/ SPV mining)\n\nI'm just saying you can use a trivially small amount of hashrate to generate just one block then feed it to another (more powerful) miner that isn't truly validating the way they should, so you could get away with having even less hashrate. (Edit: perhaps I've misinterpreted with what he means with that sentence)": 1, "Dude, don't quote people out of context or paraphrase them. It's just immature. That's /r/politics level shit-tier posting.\n\nIf you want to debate ideas like a man, do it with honesty.": 25, "> translate this into non-dev speak?\n\nSome of this is based on the concept that it would be nice and important to have a reason to run full nodes other than altruism; full nodes are software that receives and validates all transaction in the bitcoin blockchain. It's deceptively easy to avoid using your own fully-validating bitcoin node, and the implications are not widely understood. Including multiple merkle trees some with invalid transactions would be an interesting way to encourage users to fully validate transactions, although I suspect there's a chance that it may serve to encourage users to use third-party API services instead of their own fully-validating bitcoin nodes.... Hopefully this isn't true.": 2, 'Exactly, a header chain is just as secure as a full chain in terms of the POW effort that is required to build it. \n\nThat is why SPV works, attackers are economically incentivized to not do this.\n\nAll these attacks are in theory only': 3, 'What a horribly slanted title.': 14, 'I believe Peter Wiulle is currently reworking the merkle tree checking/validating components of Bitcoin core so this might be covered by his work. ': 2, 'Perhaps I am being dense, but how does that make it easier to attack SPV miners. If it forces them to validate then surely the end result is that they are harder to attack ?\n\n': 2, 'I\'m not talking about "SPV mining" at all. These attacks have nothing to do with SPV mining.': 1, 'Ah, sorry. I was reading on my phone and mis-read your comment. I agree it is a possibility.': 1, "His shilling for Viacoin, asking buttcoin members to fund spam attacks against Bitcoin, claiming he could have created a better Bitcoin than Satoshi, and recently becoming a /buttcoin moderator surely haven't helped...": 2, 'I think you\'re missing the part where you take your fake block and give it an "not-really-validating" miner to ~~amplify the possibility that your attack will be successful.~~ make your attack even cheaper to perform.\n\n* Build a fake block with coins going to victim(s).\n* Find a mining pool (or group of pools) that aren\'t validating\n* Let them build the chain for you.\n\nProblem is that\'s a little bit more detectable to the network as a whole.': 1, "If he wanted to do that he wouldn't have made a new account first.": 2, 'Yes, you can attack with below 51%, but it\'s incredibly cumbersome and not reliable (with some serious costs for failure). You don\'t telegraph any information before the attack.\n\nIf you wanted to attack full nodes this is what you do:\n\n1. Send coins to exchange\n2. Start building another chain which is faster than the current "real" chain. This attacking chain doesn\'t have the deposit. Double-spend the original spend in the attacking chain.\n3. "Withdraw" coins from exchange\n4. Hope your blocks get mined more quickly. De-facto this requires 51% of the hashpower. If you don\'t then you need to re-send the deposit.\n\nWith SPV validation:\n\n1. Build a fake block with the coins going to the victim.\n2. Mine a chain long enough to validate coins as deposited on an exchange. If not successful, keep trying.\n3. "Withdraw" coins.\n\nThe SPV attack is completely non-interactive and doesn\'t require substantially lower hashpower because the attack time is passive. Wait until you get enough and mark it as deposited. Whereas there\'s a ticking clock with a fullnode, if you\'re not successful, you need to withdraw your funds and try again. There\'s no warning with the SPV attack, and that\'s what I mean you cannot be confident with a fullnode attack -- you don\'t know if you\'re going to be successful with 35% of the hashpower.\n\nOn a systemic level, interactivity and guarantee of success is *very* important. With systemic SPV validation, the attacker can create false deposits to 1000-services, and then do a mass-attack with no penalty for failure. If you tried to attack 1000-services with fullnode validation, they might end up *taking* your deposit if you fail; the attacker is out a massive amount of coins.\n\nThink about it. You need to deposit and withdraw money every 6 confirms to attack fullnodes. That\'s a pain in the ass for any attacker, and is **incredibly** obvious for any exchange.': 1, "Thank you for the response. You make two good points: attacking a full node requires you to at least own the coins and you could attack multiple spv wallets at once. \n\nHow much more insecure does that make an spv wallet in practice?  To the first point, I would expect the amount of coins an attacker would be spoofing in an spv attack could be trivially acquired if attacking a full node for the same amount (especially by someone who presumably has millions worth of hashing power). \n\nFor number two, you would need to be simultaneously conducting transactions with thousands of people all at once which doesn't seem plausible. \n\nIn either case those seem like edge cases that hardly justify blowing up spv wallets.": 2}, ('Idea for a soft fork to disincentivize SPV mining and why SPV mining is dangerous.', 3): {'IMO the problem was in how they implemented it not necessarily the idea. There would be no problem if they were to:\n\n* Validate the header\n* Start mining on the header\n* Validate the block\n* Revert to mining on the previous block if the block is invalid.\n\nThe fiasco a couple months ago happened because pools were too lazy/incompetent to do even step one, let alone steps three and four.\n\nIf they did they above, they would receive the benefit of spv mining without creating major reorgs and losing money.\n': 2, 'Introducing that sort of erratic opt-in behaviour in the network makes it unreliable. I guess you realise how incredibly unpredictable it will be if a significant number of nodes start algorithmically picking and choosing and introducing delays?': 1, 'I upvoted because the debate is interesting, but your proposed solution sounds terrible to me. For starters it relies on local behaviour that is impossible to verify by the network. I suggest you reconsider this idea.': 2, "That's why it's not rejecting the blocks as invalid; because there will be some false positives. It just delays the propagation for whatever amount of time is determined.  Right now there are about 6000 nodes on the network. Lets say that 5% of them falsely identify a block as being SVP mined. That means 5700 nodes will relay the block without delay and the remaining 300 nodes just wait a second or two before relaying the block. The effect on block propagation time should be negligible in theory.  Now lets image that a SPV mined block is found with only a coinbase transaction. Now 100% of the nodes will identify it and each hop from node to node will wait the maximum amount of time. I Even if that wait is small, lets say 3 seconds, that will increase the propagation time for that block exponentially because it will need to be relayed multiple times before it propagates to the whole network and each node receiving the block will be adding more delay.": 1, "Mining unvalidated for longer still isn't a big deal as long as it's a reasonably small proportion of the block interval, so invalid blocks quickly get eliminated and never get very deep in the chain. Short-term (next few years) it actually alleviates most of the problems people are worrying about where slow propagtion is thought to incentivize centralization, whereas using small blocks to jack up fees makes them worse. It also reduces the network's total orphan rate, which increases the cost of a 51% attack, so it's good for network security.\n\nThe problem with the fork was that as /u/chris_pacia says, these pools weren't validating at all. Or rather, they had a properly functioning bitcoind that knew the blocks were invalid, but the code to act on this information didn't work (or didn't exist). Apparently their own bitcoind was actually rejecting their own blocks... Obviously this is sub-optimal, and they have a financial incentive to fix it.": 1, "To be honest, I was assuming that they were already doing what you described.  The issue is as blocks get larger, it takes longer to validate and the miners will be mining on unvalidated blocks for longer.  This isn't even a large block / small block issue.  It starts to show up as a problem even with 1 mb blocks.  Could you imagine how insecure SPV mining will become with the larger blocks being proposed?  Just validating the header is good enough for their profits but it isn't good enough from a security point of view.": 1, "I see. Unfortunately, stale blocks hurt the entire network too, and it's not *only* SPV miners who produce empty blocks (it's a best practice to do so between validation and computing the new block tx list).": 2, "I wasn't really suggesting that the block be considered invalid. Only that the propagation is delayed slightly. The worst case scenario is if your node falsely identifies a block as being SVP mined due to variations in the mem pool, it waits a couple of seconds for one of the included transactions to reach the minimum age before propagating it. It doesn't require every node to be in agreement because it's not rejecting the block. The idea is to increase the orphan rate for SPV miners, not to make SPV mining impossible.": 1, 'For every problem you solve you are creating more.

Thanks for the write-up tho, I'm sure someone will find it useful as a quick guide into the current state of Bitcoin community and desired future for the Bitcoin as a whole.\n\n\nIn the original post I wasn't taking about any of those aforementioned subjects (your second and the last paragraph), but I was trying to raise awareness about dangers of the lead dev position getting into hands of Mike Hearn's (especially with the knowledge of his previous proposals for censorship, redlisting, TOR filtering, etc). If XT wins Bitcoin will effectively become a different project with a different lead developer. Yes, it still will be a voluntaristic, free, open source, project, but with a lead dev who has proved himself to be pretty hostile to openness, decentralization and free speech, and more prone to censorship, filtering and centralization. Furthermore, you can see right now what he's like... if he's not satisfied with the path where the project is going, he will fork it regardless of the consequences for the original project.\n\nI agree with the notion that this fork is not about 'status of lead dev' as you said, but if XT wins 'status of lead dev' could become a great danger or even detrimental to Bitcoin. Similar to situation how Mike himself see Wladimir right now. \nSo, all the technical aspects of this proposal are debatable of course, but regardless of what happens on the technical side, with the XT you get liability on the dev side.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n": 1, "\n(Have you read the 2nd sticky?)\n\nThe danger was that proposing alt-software in haste to split the network was more dangerous than aggregately coming to consensus through a BIP proposal that addresses most concerns through a compromise on all sides, likely smaller block size increase but perhaps at a gradual pace. Plus, that's a misguided notion that its about 'status' of 'lead dev' or anything like that, that's total BS. I say this because BTC is a volunteeristic, free, open source, project.\n\nMany for profit businesses and startups have come (and gone - think about BFL) onto the scene since this project came along in 2009, but none the less, this is a community where individuals contribute through consensus. There is no danger such that XT is a more viable solution over BIP and updating BitcoinCore.\nIn fact, XT is being continuously promoted by those who wish for the rest of the world to 'hurry up and use it' so that demand goes up and we have all-time-high priced coins again. Except the reality is that won't happen based on a larger block size or even a diff software implementation (xt) alone - we need more real world use cases for BTC and systems that non-nerd/non-technical persons would want to use that would require BTC - if anything, merchants would need to buy bitcoin in bulk to have their business models work for their customers - I think consumer demand of BTC en masse only comes when people demand btc because their favorite business is using it without their knowledge.\n\nThe sticky doesn't go into those details but I have implied them from the actions of most vocal users for XT as opposed to everyone else. Also, from my observations, it seems that Reddit community acts different than bitcointalk community - like ppl on reddit flock to BTC because its potentially a high risk/high reward investment and Bitcointalk users came because they think Bitcoin is cool and that it could potentially be used in many different real world applications over time, there's of course exceptions to the rule and everyone acts in accordance to their own interests at the end of the day, ultimately.

Either lots of small fees through lots of transactions (which will consume huge amounts of resources and cause the centralization of Bitcoin) or through fewer BC transactions with larger fees, which protects decentralization.  However, if there are few transactions with low fees, miners leave.  If lightning were to develop without a fee market in place, Bitcoin would be vulnerable.

The latter is dynamic when block size can\'t accommodate demand. The higher the market fee density, the more it costs to fill a block.\n\nWe saw fees rise sharply during the last attacks. That raises the costs for users, but also spammers. The harder spammers push, the more expensive the attack becomes. Effectively, the spammer is able to raise transaction fees temporarily, but not shut the network down.\n\nThis assumes some sensible fix to the problem of a node running out of RAM to host the memory pool. But that\'s much easier than a hard fork. I suspect the solution will take the form of simply blocking/dropping transactions that pay a sub-market fee density. In other words, the relay fee would start to float in conjunction with the miner fee. If the spammer wants to continue to play, he must pay.\n\nWith no pushback from a low block size limit, a spammer such as CoinWallet can fill blocks for days on end with a known, fixed cost. With constrained blocks, the spammer will have to factor in the escalation of fees due to competition.\n\nThe cost to flood a network running 1 MB blocks could easily surpass the cost to flood a network running 8 MB blocks.\n\nEither way, users who care about their money would be wise to consider the trustworthiness of a service operator willing to perform such an attack rather than engage directly.\n\nedit: added stuff\n\n': 16, 'I generally agree with you.

It gets uncontrollable only during hyper inflation, which can only be reached with sustained periods of high inflation.\n\n>What will replace it is still unclear, but I suspect that when the stuff really hits the fan and inflation rages the government will try the approach taken by the Germans to end their hyperinflation back in the 1920s, coming up with the equivalent of the Rentenmark \xe2\x80\x93 a dollar that is loosely linked to some basket of commodities and financial instruments. It won\xe2\x80\x99t be convertible, because it would be impossible for bank tellers to exchange your dollar for a cup of oil, and a coupon off of a bond, and a chip of gold, or whatever makes up the basket \xe2\x80\x93 but it might restore some semblance of confidence in the currency. That\xe2\x80\x99s one option. Another is that some government decides to make its currency convertible into precious metals; but that will only happen when all other less fiscally restraining systems have been floated and failed. Simply, at this point we can\xe2\x80\x99t know what will replace the current monetary system, or when. All we can know is that the status quo cannot and so will not survive this crisis.\n\nEntirely voided because it relies on the premise inflation is uncontrollable and hyper inflation is inevitable.\n\n>According to a study of 775 fiat currencies by DollarDaze.org, there is no historical precedence for a fiat currency that has succeeded in holding its value. Twenty percent failed through hyperinflation, 21% were destroyed by war, 12% destroyed by independence, 24% were monetarily reformed, and 23% are still in circulation approaching one of the other outcomes. Average life expectancy is 27 years.\n\nModern monetary policy is a relatively recent phenomenon created by Milton Friedman, the policies done by old fiat currencies before him is entirely irrelevant, and the late 20th and early 21st century monetary policy of developing nations is irrelevant, none of them use the monetary policy championed and used by the Euro and the USA, of which the USA\'s is almost quadrupled the life span of the "expected fiat life span" (Gold backed American currency effectively ended during FDR\'s presidency and de jure ended by Nixon, the fact this blogger doesn\'t know that suggests his incompetence and lack of understanding of currency economics) and there is no evidence of any sudden change or hyper inflation, voiding the idea there is some invisible and invincible wall that all fiat currencies will hit.\n\n>Founded in 1694, the British pound Sterling is the oldest fiat currency in existence. At a ripe old age of 317 years it must be considered a highly successful fiat currency. However, success is relative. The British pound was defined as 12 ounces of silver, so it\'s worth less than 1/200 or 0.5% of its original value. In other words, the most successful long standing currency in existence has lost 99.5%\n\nThe fact that fiat currencies loss their value over hundred of years is a common scare tactic used by anti-fiat\'s, however they have never shown any evidence that this is relevant for anyone that hasn\'t lived since 1644. When you net decouple, compensation has tracked both productivey and inflation, meaning this is irrelevant to the common person because they make more money than inflation by a comfortable margin and that inflation has actually declined since the \n1960\'s, so that means some explosion in the right of inflation is impossible without the central bank causing it.\n\n>History has a message for us: No fiat currency has lasted forever. Eventually, they all fail.\n\nThe logic here is that because early 1900\'s countries used early 1900\'s monetary policy, modern and advanced monetary policy is doomed to kill fiat currency. You can\'t use history as an example unless we are still using the same methods of the past, which we are not.\n\n>You might suspect this happened only to third world countries. You\xe2\x80\x99d be wrong. There was no discrimination as to the size or perceived stability of a nation\xe2\x80\x99s economy; if the leaders abused their currency, the country paid the price.\n\nWithout him noticing, this person just admitted that inflation is caused by the government, not some unstoppable effect caused by fiat currency in general. He suggests that the government leaders cause inflation, not fiat currency in the essence (Which is true, as inflation is a phenomenon caused by monetary policy). So the conclusion is simple, as long as the people are politically active and the central bank is intelligent (Which, under Bernanke and now Yellen, is undoubtedly true), inflation is not intrinsic to fiat currency. \n\n***\n\nThat was a pretty shitty blog post.': -4, 'Makes me appreciate gold as money more.

I was having trouble understanding if you were a charlatan or misguided, but now I'm pretty clear.\n\n* You post a proposal where the author states this:\n\n> I suppose one way to go about the interface would be to first add some infrastructure for queued/delayed transactions. E.g. you could tell it {I want to pay 1AAA, with a timeout of N seconds} and it queues it and returns just a locally significant handle instead of a TXID (and in the GUI shows it in some queued transactions tab). This could obviously be used purely locally to merge multiple outputs of your own into a sendmany.  With that in place, I think casual coinjoins (where you're not trying super hard to match values, and only making them where you would have otherwise made a payment) would have no further interface impact except a switch to enable/disable using them to process queued transactions.\n\n* But you keep on stressing the absolute need to get all transactions equal.\n* Then you actually claim that given this equality, you have cryptographic anonymity.  You actually won't admit that knowing an input went to 1 of 3 outputs, say, is nothing like the cryptographic requirement of anonymity (that there is no leak of identity at all).  In fact, [the distinction between partial and true anonymity](http://vneumann.etse.urv.cat/webCrises/publications/lncs/partialAnonimity.pdf) is clear in the literature.\n* You make claims of perfect information theoretic security.  This is directly contradicted by the fact that there is a direct entropic decrease by the publishing of a transaction.  The distribution is not uniform across the entire network.

This is *greater* information than the 0 correlation to any other address not listed in the outputs, so even there you have positive information for reconstruction of the transaction graph.

Each address is always fully spent. A transaction would be a collection of addresses adding up to at least the transacted amount. Change comes back in fixed denominations as well.': 9, "One thing that might help also: if the spend amount has a lot of trailing zeros, eg, 2.34000000 BTC, then have change outputs that also have the same amount of trailing zeros.

As far as I am aware Mike has almost no proposals [*] in the Bitcoin ecosystem to improve scalablity as the term is conventionally and usefully defined.  By contrast, I am also one of the most active contributors to scalablity technology for Bitcoin at least on the invention side.\n\n[*] The one exception that I\'m aware of is the SPV bloom filters which were implement by Matt Corallo, but in that case they were rushed, buggy, and came with substantial DOS attack vulnerability and privacy loss. Unfortunately we we pressured into deploying them right away, which is too bad because not much latter some much better designs were invented.\n\nA scalable system is one where increased load does not create costs that grow without bound or require decreasing the functionality of the system ([examples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalability#Examples)).  Mike in this case is an advocate of removing resource management functionality, this does not improve the scalablity of the system, but instead allows it to make different trade-offs, including ones which feature substantially increased trust on centralized third parties.\n\nExamples of actual scalability tools would be things like [committed UTXO sets](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=21995.0) (Allows completely storage-less full nodes). [Fraud proofs](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/User:Gmaxwell/features#Proofs) (makes the SPV scheme as described in the bitcoin whitepaper practical), [Headers first synchronization](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/User:Gmaxwell/Reverse_header-fetching_sync) (allows higher security nodes to start as lower security, prevents a trivial dos attack that stops all new nodes from starting if blocks larger than a tiny size are allowed), [Coinwitness](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=277389.0) potentially changes system scaling at full security from quadratic to sublinear, but requires crypto that is too cutting edge and slow yet,  [network block coding](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/User:Gmaxwell/block_network_coding) which would decouple block propagation time and size, and make having more connections sending a block in parallel not waste more bandwidth (e.g. relaying being O(1) rather than O(n) per block). Also work by other people, like Pieter making ECDSA 6-8x faster are scalablity improvements, or making transaction verification something like 40x faster via ultra-prune, are doing scalability work. Things like Matt\'s relay network (prevents sending every mined transaction twice). Things like the Poon\'s lightning network are scalablity work. (And I must apologize to the literally hundreds of other things done by others that I\'ve failed to include here, including the academic work in this space-- which is itself a very new area).  \n\nAnd this is why it\'s especially concerning when the people-- potentially _all_ the people-- who have been consistently and actively working on scalablity respond to this saying that making a sudden increase in blocksize is not something the system can obviously handle and should be considered very carefully is something you should find quite concerning. Why hasn\'t all this work resulted in huge blocks? Partly because some of it isn\'t ready to go yet, but largely because the work so far has been needed to just keep up with the prior limits. But in some sense it has, it\'s created enough headroom that you can reasonably run a node locally with multi-megabyte blocks and have it not immediately fall over. \n\nIt\'s easy to ignore all this because it rapidly becomes technical mintua at the end of the day it just matters that Bitcoin works for people. It\'s especially easy to ignore if you\'ve built up faith that Bitcoin is "anti-fragile" and by the good graces of the invisible hand of the free market it can never fail... especially if you\'ve not given much thought to [where antifragility comes from](http://epistle.us/inspiration/godwillsaveme.html).\n\nPulling in a car analogy, you have a pit crew that just added hardened pistons, closed loop anti-knock sensing fuel-air mixture control, nitrous, and recently invented and is planning on building the turbo-charger, all while also contributing to maintaining track and painting the car (which happen to be some of their most visible activities; because they\'re easy to explain).\n\n... and while they\'re busily debating compression ratios and high octane fuel and the seeming impossibility of getting the car to safely go much faster with the current state of technology you have a guy standing on the sidelines with a beer cup hat, saying "No problem guys: lets remove the breaks!"  and the crowd goes wild: Finally someone who cares about speed.\n': 152, "Didn't realize Chris Pratt was a bitcoin advocate.": 12, 'Are you saying that in your estimation Gavin has cared about privacy/confidentiality/anonymity?

Output values should only be known to the sender, recipient, and anyone they choose to show audit logs to. Validators only have a need to be sure that no inflation is going on, but truly have no business knowing how much was transacted. Confidential transactions achieves this fairly well.\n\n2. The payment graph itself should also only be known to participants and those auditors they explicitly allow. The validators need to know that Alice's output is spent so as to prevent double-spends and allow pruning, and they need to know that Bob has a new output. But any uncertainty about the fact that it was Alice who paid Bob (as opposed to any of the other outputs being spent in that block) would be a welcome improvement. This is what Monero-like ring signatures, or one-way aggregate signatures, or zerocoin/zerocash like proofs provide.\n\nThere's still quite a bit of research to be done to validate existing proposals and to gain confidence that one or more of them are ready to be rolled into bitcoin.

Because the chunks are random there is no way of knowing.\n\nOr, only make 0.005 chunks, so that a large amount of the addresses in the UTXO end up with 0.005 - it's like hiding in plain sight by all wearing the same clothes.\n\nHowever, this would bloat the blockchain.\n\nJust something I was thinking about lately.": 65, 'Not quite, because ring signatures for privacy require additional data structure to prevent double spending.': 6, '> Does participating in JoinMarket as participant (someone who gets percentage of transactions for obfuscating, not sure what it\'s called) do you have to run a full node?

I\'ve put some coins on there, but not too much. In the few months it\'s been running on mainnet we\'ve seen two interesting cases - (1) a person who gave 2.8 btc to a maker because they weren\'t paying attention to how insanely high the requested fee was. some extra warnings were added but that will always be possible because by design it\'s a free market. (2)a person who accidentally put 1.59 coins into an easily hackable wallet (by putting a blank bip32 wallet seed phrase in). I swept that and gave it back to them, and fixed the bug/loophole.\n\nI list these two (which I believe were the only two cases of people losing or nearly losing coins) to illustrate that this is not some super-battle-tested codebase. On the bright side, if the code does what it purports to do, then there is no trust issue; you are not handing over coins to someone else in coinjoin.': 12, 'All this work has been done but the leadership on the block size debate has been sorely lacking.

Coinjoin is not progress, it is snakeoil.  It is the security through obscurity of the blockchain.  There are simple algorithms for recovering identity from joined transactions by solving various subset sum problems.  In many cases, this is a complete partition, but even in those rare cases where the inversion is partial, it maintains enough information to monitor transaction history and build the likely transaction map, and this only grows likelihood over time and additional transactions establishing connections.\n\nAs others have said:\n\n> SharedCoin and other services implementing the CoinJoin protocol enhance the privacy of users transactions by allowing them to construct shared transactions that prevent a casual observer from tracing all account activity on the public ledger with minimal effort. They do not prevent a determined investigator from correlating transactions or an adversary with information about specific addresses from correlating them to specific payments and payees.\n\n> If you want to truly hide transactions, SharedCoin and other implementations of CoinJoin are not for you \xe2\x80\x93 they are neither sufficient nor convenient. SharedCoin provides a basic level of enhanced privacy transaction but doesn\xe2\x80\x99t guarantee anonymity nor was it intended to.\n\nIt is so odd to me just how much effort goes into ignoring all the research on deanonymizing mixing and cooperative joining schemes.  Every few months someone makes a huge effort to push for adding cooperative mixing to Bitcoin because that\'s what they learned to do out in the dark nets (where it never was secure in the first place).\n\nConcerning what alternatives there are - well, it depends on what is wanted.  I too am all for "making progress despite perfection not being available", as long as we actually make progress.  We know of algorithms today that can create "transaction witnesses" which can be recorded in the blockchain which:\n\n* Is cryptographically secure against exposing inputs and outputs.\n* Yet an algorithm exist for accumulating witnesses and validating that a new transaction witness is consistent with existing witnesses (i.e. that proves a new witness describes a transaction where the inputs exist and are sufficient for the outputs without exposing values or addresses to the validation algorithm).\n\nIn fact, there are several ways this can be done.  Ring signature unfolding and ZK-SNARKs are the big ones in the community I guess.  Combinations of Merkle puzzles and zero-knowledge proofs can be used.  DC-Nets offer an architecture that can be built upon for the anonymous validation.  Mahdi Zamani has been doing some amazing work in the anonymizing protocol space that can be adapter here as well.

Since it needs to be so secure then it makes no sense within this scenario to do anything that would hinder it's functionability, making blocks bigger is an unknown so they view this change as a threat.\n\nThing is, the XT proposal is of course a logical conclusion of what happens when one of the groups views the 1mb cap nearing in daily usage as a fundamental threat to what Bitcoin is, so they rush to bring something out.  This action in itself is ofcourse viewed as a fundamental threat to Bitcoin by the small blockers, because it isn't exactly known *what* will happen with this change.
