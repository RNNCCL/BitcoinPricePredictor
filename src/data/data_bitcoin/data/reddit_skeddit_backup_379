In fact, even as we speak, many vendors (especially near the Northern border) already accept Bulgarian levs (which are pegged to the euro).

But there are various other ways to do this.\n\nElectrum supports this operation because it allows you to create a transaction using a "watch-only" wallet on your desktop. This is a wallet that has no seed / keys - so it cannot spend bitcoins. Here are the basic steps:\n\n1. Install Electrum on a secondary system. Disconnect and never connect again on this system. Create a wallet and write down the seed. Export the MPK (Master Public Key) to a usb stick.\n\n2. On your desktop system, plug in the usb stick and choose "File, Restore" wallet, pasting in the MPK. This create a "watch only" wallet. Now this wallet can view activity on the blockchain and create transactions but it cannot **sign** them.\n\nBelow is how you safely spend using offline signing:\n\n1. On desktop create a transaction and save the "unsigned" transaction to a usb stick (only option on this type of wallet). \n\n2. On your secondary system plug in the usb stick and choose "Tools, Load Transaction". Verify the addresses and amounts are correct (not fiddled with by malware on the desktop before saving). Click "Sign" and enter password. Save the "signed" transaction back to the usb stick.\n\n3. Back on desktop, plug in the usb stick and choose "Tools, Load Transaction". Check it\'s still correct. Click "Broadcast" to actually send it on the network.\n\nIn this model your seed/private keys are never exposed to a net connected computer. It\'s a bit more hassle, but not much. After you\'ve done a couple test runs it becomes very easy. Obviously you wouldn\'t do this for pocket change amounts like you may have in your real life wallet but for amounts like you may keep in a bank or safe. You can use such a process to replenish your phone / desktop wallet as you need.\n\n\n\n': 7}, ('Reddit on the Blockchain Test', 0): {}, ('Bitlending Club Now Beats BTCJam In Terms Of Monthly Loan Volume', 6): {"I'm not surprised. btcjam = forced interest rates , bad criteria for credit ratings and terrible support.": 3, 'been using both, i can see why.  bitlending is far superior IMO.  way better layout and stuff': 2, 'Maybe I shall go there then': 2}, ('Bitcoin being forked? by Izabella Kaminska', 0): {'still FT domain, and it means they tolerate idiocy.': 1, "Did Bitcoin kill Izabella Kaminska's dog or something?

There is no rational mechanism provided there to actually construct such a system.\n\nEffectively the article continues at great length about the virtues of the spherical massless cow, without pausing to consider if one can actually be constructed; or if its existence would actually solve any problem that anyone had actually wanted solved.\n\nConsider, miners need only announce addresses in their blocks where they'll accept transactions; and then users can just transmit directly completely skipping those miner run / affiliated nodes. This also has the benefit of being much more traffic efficient.  This issue is fundamental and must be solved before its worth even considering the other flaws in the description (e.g. avoiding the infinite regress if you're using transactions to pay for transactions).\n\nThe author appears to more or less misunderstands the purpose of relay in the Bitcoin system as a capacity service; similar to Bittorrent, when that isn't the case at all-- Miners would be perfectly happy rapidly sharing their blocks to the dozen others that constitute the super-majority of the hash-power. All others can get the data 'eventually' and the system works, even if eventually is via some more or less subscription service (e.g. via SPV).\n": 4, "Lamentably, your response poorly evaluates the proposal.\n\nRegrettably, your conflicts of interest seem to blind you to the realities of the ecosystem.\n\nIronically, your own company contributes to failure modes introduced by the recent evolution of the network.\n\nUsers should trust miners less than the p2p network.  The recent BIP66 soft fork debacle, a miserably failed upgrade attempt, is clear evidence of that.\n\nBlockstream greatly enables the practice of SPV mining that enabled this failure, by providing a fast UNVALIDATED and CENTRALIZED relay between miners.\n\nGiven the lower deserved trust, users should expect miners to offer a transaction submission service for a lower price than independent nodes.  Why doesn't this happen much already?  One reason is because miners themselves value the p2p network's role in validating incoming traffic.\n\nA rational miner should never be happy with transmitting a found block only to a few other miners, for many reasons.  He doesn't really know where the rest of the miners are.  Other miners have a disincentive to further relay the block.  Users without the block can create invalid transactions.

My company does nothing operational currently, except with testnet. \n\n> users should expect miners to offer a transaction submission service for a lower price than independent nodes. Why doesn't this happen much already?\n\nHave you actually used Bitcoin before?  Frank question. Your response here is so confused... there is no cost at all imposed by or collected by network nodes.\n\n> One reason is because miners themselves value the p2p network's role in validating incoming traffic.\n\nThis has no utility and, AFAIK, isn't consistent with anyone's actual behavior.\n\n> A rational miner should never be happy with transmitting a found block only to a few other miners, for many reasons.\n\nIncome maximization requires most of the hash-power has received a block as fast as possible, not more.\n\n> Other miners have a disincentive to further relay the block\n\nThey don't need to.\n\n> Users without the block can create invalid transactions.\n\nAnyone can create an invalid transaction any any time, and anyone can verify and reject it.

That was just plain bullshit, since the interface between bitcoin.de and PayCenter is me typing in different numbers for every transaction.

That didn\'t made sense either, since to bitcoin.de every bank account is the same and it would be bitcoin.de that had a security breach.\n\nI forwarded the whole email chain to PayCenter and they were just as confused as I was and told me there was no known security breach.\n\nI forwarded that back to bitcoin.de and haven\'t heard since from then.\n\nNow the interesting thing is their special partnership with Fidor Bank. They enable express buying/selling through Fidor Bank and make a point to push every customer to Fidor.
