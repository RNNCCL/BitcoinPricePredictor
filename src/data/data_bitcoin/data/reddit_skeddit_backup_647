Consider this scenario:\n\n* Bob sends a transaction of 1 BTC that is only valid until block 100 to an exchange at block 99.\n* At block 110, I withdraw 500 BTC from the exchange. One of the inputs to this transaction is the 1 BTC that Bob deposited.\n* Due to some weird disturbance in the Internet, the Bitcoin network was split 49-51 during this time. I was on the shorter side. At block 120 on the larger chain, the networks merge, and there is a reorganization. It is now block 120, but this chain does not include the original "locked-after" transaction. This invalidates the transaction I received. So 500 of my bitcoins have now vanished, even though I received them in a transaction with 11 confirmations and I\'m not being attacked by the sender of the transaction or any miners.\n\nLosing money *accidentally* like this is impossible with Bitcoin except in extremely long chain forks of more than 100 blocks. Having transactions that start valid but later become invalid makes it possible. One way of adding such transactions without hurting Bitcoin\'s security would be to require that anyone receiving such transactions not spend them until they have 101 confirmations, the same as the maturation time for generation transactions, which exists to prevent very similar issues.': 1, 'Two conditions can be placed based on being before or after a certain block.': 1, 'You mean that basically the output can only be spent Until Block > nLockTime, by which point the transaction cannot be fulfilled?': 1, 'Use a centralised coupon system for this.': 1, 'Good point.

If the transaction is submitted later, it is rejected and never makes it into the blockchain.\n\nSo you can hand people fully signed transactions, that must be submitted before a certain point in time, or else they become invalid and worthless.\n\nOf course, nothing prevents Alice to put the transaction on the network ("submit the voucher") without actually using the voucher as intended.
