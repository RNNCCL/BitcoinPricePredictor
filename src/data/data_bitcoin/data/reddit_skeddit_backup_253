There are plenty of nodes in Europe, plus work going on in Japan, Phillipines, Russia, Australia, Canada, Argentina, and Venezuela. Bitcoin is simply the most widely adopted cryptocurrency in the world, and the ideas discussed in the podcast can naturally derive from it.': 1, "So what's the problem?

I think a token is required for a secure decentralized blockchain, and that bitcoin is the clear winner in that regard.

So, my argument is based on the last 7 years of cryptocurrency history. And if anything, current developments are only increasing the likelihood that this will continue.\n\nTo argue another way, I think cryptocurrency is different than the other categories you mentioned. Cryptocurrency is inherently about money and value. People should naturally tend to move towards holding their value in that which is most valuable. Value stored with something intangible like digital cryptocurrency, which sometimes can feel ephemeral, should be based on security. I think it\'s very difficult to argue that Bitcoin is less secure than any competing cryptocurrency, based on a number of factors. One factor is it\'s been around the longest, so it has "accumulated security" and a great deal of testing, over that period of time. So, while other currencies may experiment, at the end of the day people will want to store majority of value in the most secure and conservative chain, i.e. Bitcoin. As value accumulates, it also incentivizes continued maintenance and improvement, leading to continuous improvement and incentivizing yet more value to be stored within.': 3}, ('Incredible !
