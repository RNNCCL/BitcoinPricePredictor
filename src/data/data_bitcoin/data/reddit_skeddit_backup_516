You also need to pay a onetime membership fee (30 Euros). In other words, the minimum amount of money needed to join is 60 Euros. Your first share will give you one vote. You can also buy as many additional shares (30 Euros each) you want. There is no upper limit to your investment.\n\nEvery member has one vote independent of the amount of shares you have. You can use your vote in member meetings, where we decide on important co-op issues. As a member you can suggest Robin Hood Projects, become part of the selection board and participate in the work of the cooperative.\n\nYou can buy shares by clicking the green BUY SHARES button. When you click this button several fields appear. One that asks the amount of shares, another that asks you to choose one of the six options about how you want to divide your net profits (profit minus co-op\xe2\x80\x99s costs) between you and Robin Hood Projects. If you choose to keep more than 50% of the profit, there is a onetime fee.\n\nOnce a month, the money invested in shares will be exchanged in dollars and sent to our broker, Interactive Brokers, in New York. That creates a new series, which will be invested in stock exchange, according to the information from our algorithm. Thus, the performance of the investment depends both on the euro/dollar exchange rate fluctuations and the success of our investment portfolio on the stock exchange. Please note: There are no guarantees as past performance is not an indication of the future results.\n\nWe are a \xe2\x80\x98slow\xe2\x80\x99 investment organization. If you would like to sell your shares, you will need to notify the co-op. We are regulated by the co-operative law of Finland and other Finnish regulations. The actual value of each share is calculated after the end of the fiscal year (end of June) when costs of the co-operative are deducted from them. The Finnish law lets us transfer monies from sold shares earliest six months after the end of the fiscal year. You can also sell your shares to other members.
