Lemme start with a conspiracy theory of the week:\n\nI just noticed thepiratebay no longer has a bitcoin donation address. I'm very certain they had one before the takedown, so I looked in the internet archive and found it. Not gunna post it here in case it's dead (there's still a 1+ btc balance though)\n\nHere's the interesting part: If it's the same owner then putting the bitcoin address back there is pretty easy. They were reusing addresses. Alternatively the owner could sign a message with the new address, using the old key, which is the only way to prove tpb hasn't changed hands.\n\nWhy isn't it up? This suggests they aren't the same owner and is someone that doesn't support Bitcoin, or the owner has had a change of heart about Bitcoin (I'll come back to this point in a sec). I haven't been that involved with tpb news so I'm not sure if there was any legitimate transfer of ownership between the takedown. Anyhow lets assume it's either the real owner, or the FBI took it and the honeypot theory is true.\n\nIf it's a new owner, and a new address comes up without a signed message, then it may hint that ownership of tpb has changed hands. If they put the old address back there then they aren't getting any money, only the same person would do that. If they do put it back up, then we can view the blockchain and verify if that money is going anywhere. In fact looking at the funds right now they haven't been spent since 2014-10-17.\n\nBased on this, if tpb was compromised, we're likely never going to see a Bitcoin address donation on tpb because the chances of them owning the key would be pretty slim, and they'll rather go with the 'I had a change of heart, I don't believe in Bitcoin anymore' story. So the longer we don't see a bitcoin address or a new signed address, the more the reason we should not use tpb.": 1}, ('Bitcoin Rush-36 w/ AndreasAntonopoulos, FibreCoin, BitcoinGarden, LaraCelenza, ProofOfWork', 2): {}, ("We don't need 7000+ copies of the blockchain", 0): {"It's all about trust...\n\nIf you trust fewer/centralized full nodes/institutions to act on your best interests (include your transactions/let you spend your coins/not to lie) then of course we can have fewer full copies of the blockchain (I guess at the extreme we could have one copy right?  I mean if everyone trusts that holder...).  Gigantic centralized institutions can of course get away with fewer copies of their data -> they decide the 'truth' in their databases.\n\nBut here, the more full copies of the blockchain, the harder it is to make the network disappear (or muck with who can use it, etc) -> stuff that we don't typically face every day.\n\nFor short term functional activity spv is great and when everything is working well we don't 'need' that many full nodes -> but the true utility of having lots of full nodes isn't apparent until there are problems. More full nodes increases the durability but as you noted not necessarily the efficiency/throughput.\n\nThere's also the question of channel leakage -> if one has a full node/copy of the blockchain -> then all the analytics/usage can be done without external observation...  It's very easy to track the information people requested about particular addresses/blocks/transactions and tie them to their physical location (access point) if they only pull the data (and/or subsets) from other nodes.\n\nIn general I'd like to see as many people as possible run full nodes -> those that have an interest in learning how the system works, tinkering around with it and maybe building on it.  \n\nWhile I disagree with you about the need to have full nodes, I like seeing the different perspectives appear as people with different backgrounds and goals begin to think about practical implementations of cryptocoins -> over time I fully expect the accepted modifications to the protocol (ex: blocksize) to change in ways that match the practical needs of the users as things rollout.

For example, the SHA-256 hash values of "That\'s all, Folks!" and "ACME  Catalog" may just coincidently be the same. The probability is mind-bogglingly low, but not zero.\n\nLikewise, two different public keys (with different private keys) can coincidentally give the same hash value. If this happens, the same address will be controlled by two different private keys.\n\nIn fact, this is guaranteed to happen. To get an intuitive feel for why, look at Steps #7 and #8 in the link. The number of bytes decreases from 33 (compressed public key, 32 bytes of x-coordinate + 1 byte flag) to 20 (RIPE160, which leads after a few steps to the address).\n\nThere are ~2^256 (2^(32*8)) public keys, but only 2^160 (2^(20*8)) addresses. Public keys outnumber addresses by a factor of ~2^96 (2^(256-160)).

For instance, an HD wallet consists of a single seed that can generate a practically infinite number of private keys, corresponding to practically infinite numbers of addresses.

": 1, "Every single adress in your Trezor has its own private key. But the keys are generated from a master seed in a deterministic way.\n\nIt's kind of like the natural numbers.

Most importantly it's a one way operation, so you can generate new keys from your seed, but you can't go back to your seed from your private keys.\n\nI'm not an expert, so take everything a say with that in mind.

I made no "indirect statement".  \n\nHere\'s a good double metaphor for some sorely needed rhetorical effect.  \n\nThink of Novauri is a currency exchange service at a counter in the airport.  When you buy and sell with Novauri (the currency exchange counter), you pay one currency, the agent exchanges it for another at a conversion rate, and they load it to a bank card from your personal bank account and then you walk away.\n\nThink of our competitors are banks with a big vaults.  When you go to a competitor (a bank), they decide to let you in the building, you hand them some cash, they exchange it for the other currency, but they stick the other currency right back in the vault for "safe keeping".  They give YOU a bank card that has a representation of the money in the vault that you just exchanged so you can access and use it.\n\nThe risk with Novauri is that the agent at the counter specifically steals money out of your bank account because he or she somehow managed to write down your card number and other credentials without anyone noticing.  If they did this for a while to enough customers with no one noticing, they might be able to get away with a few peoples\' funds.  \n\nThe risk with a competitor is that the owner of the bank is a crook and steals EVERYONE\'s money all at once from the vault.\n\nWith Novauri, you risk someone compromising customer accounts one by one over time until someone notices.  With competitors, you risk someone stealing everyones\' money all at once, which instantly ruins everyone involved.\n\nThe currency exchange counter doesn\'t have access to everyones\' money, it can only steal credentials if no one notices.  The bank holds everything, and is a much more lucrative target.\n\nThe thing is, the bank vs. counter makes the bank seem safer falsely.  In reality, the counter and bank scams are equally difficult to pull off.  The difficulty of perpetrating each heist is the same.\n\nIf we get hacked it will likely be a minor event because someone on our team or out in the community will catch the counter agent writing down the card numbers, because we have a camera on the person and are watching.

Inflation and all other stuff would remain. My guess is that crypto is just a container that can broad base currencies. Think of it as being the casino chips for the Net.

In bitcoin land those costs are pushed directly to the user.  Sure if you have $500 in bitcoin you may not invest in security, but how does a future bitcoin world fucntion when a Fortune 1000 has to carry the cost of holding bitcoin, or a small business that cannot afford security.\n\nSo you end up having to setup trusted parties that can handle security for you.\n\n': 1}, ("HouseOfSpirit's shop is open!!!

If you do I will definitely support you!" And then the CSR responds that we\'ve accepted bitcoin for two years now, and the customer is never heard from again.\n\nTo a business owner (or frankly anyone who is moderately conscious), these people going around telling businesses to accept Bitcoin have no intention of *spending* Bitcoin, they just want to artificially inflate the perceived utility of their magic internet money. \n\nI have yet to have someone say "do you accept Bitcoin", have my CSR say "why yes we do!", and have the customer actually make a purchase.
