Off the top of my head there is Mycelium for Android, Greenaddress, Bitcoin Core, Blockchain.info.\n\nI\'m not 100% sure about circle, but these other wallets I mentioned should receive the coins instantly. You can also send the coins out of your wallet instantly as well, where the confirmations come in to play depends on how many the receiving end requires. Some sites only require one confirmation, some none, normally one is pretty standard however. \n\nIf you\'re interested in how exactly you are able to receive the coins instantly and send them out instantly here\'s a brief explanation: Each transaction shows up immediately on the network after it is sent and will show as "unconfirmed", the wallets I mentioned above accept unconfirmed transactions. When a transaction is signed it is stored in the next block to be mined, as soon as that block is mined it will be confirmed, on average this takes about 10 minutes. So if you buy from LibertyX, send to your personal wallet, and then send to an address that requires one confirmation, all back to back within a few minutes of each other, chances are all these transactions will be in the same block.

Arbitrage exists as a result of market inefficiencies; it provides a mechanism to ensure prices do not deviate substantially from fair value for long periods of time."\nIt is a trade that profits by exploiting price differences of identical or similar financial instruments, on different markets or in different forms\nNow in this particular case it\'s not a simple straightforward arbitrage, you have two instruments that are similar but not identical.  Furthermore the difficulty is compounded by the fact that they trade on different exchanges and further to that one can not "Short" the GBTC shares, at least not that I\'m aware of.\n\nSo, in order to do the arbitrage, you must already be a "current" GBTC shareholder (one that bought in from the beginning), and you must already have a Bitcoin trading account at some Bitcoin exchange with money "already" deposited in the amount of GBTC that you intend to sell.\n\nYou have to have some capital to do that. Not many people are in the position to do this but as news filters out original GBTC holders may want to avail themselves of the opportunity until price differentials presumably narrow.\n\n1) You need to have the GBTC shares \n2) You need an account at a bitcoin exchange with money already in there.\n\nSo all you do then is sell your GBTC shares for argument say $400, and then buy an equivalent amount of BTC at your bitcoin exchange, at a lower price such as the current $235. You\'ve made, or freed up, $165 per bitcoin that you wouldn\'t have had. You can now use that money to buy more bitcoin if you wanted to. So if you started with 100 BTC (1000 GBTC), you would now have 170.2 BTC.  So the trader has accumulated and additional 70.2 bitcoins in this simple conversion which I believe satisfies the definition of arbitrage, "a trade that profits by exploiting price differences of identical or similar financial instruments, on different markets or in different forms".\n\nBut it\'s a one time only arbitrage.

The central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust. Banks must be trusted to hold our money and transfer it electronically, but they lend it out in waves of credit bubbles with barely a fraction in reserve. We have to trust them with our privacy, trust them not to let identity thieves drain our accounts. Their massive overhead costs make micropayments impossible.\n\n>A generation ago, multi-user time-sharing computer systems had a similar problem. Before strong encryption, users had to rely on password protection to secure their files, placing trust in the system administrator to keep their information private. Privacy could always be overridden by the admin based on his judgment call weighing the principle of privacy against other concerns, or at the behest of his superiors. Then strong encryption became available to the masses, and trust was no longer required. Data could be secured in a way that was physically impossible for others to access, no matter for what reason, no matter how good the excuse, no matter what.\n\n> It\'s time we had the same thing for money.\n\n-----\n\n(continued...)': 6, "Satoshi also didn't envision mining pools that could potentially lead to centralisation.

To achieve this, Bitcoin seeks to bring strong personal autonomy to a domain where-- like early time-shared computers-- autonomy has been frequently compromised  due to expedience and the necessity of trusting others; to accomplish this we replace that trust with machinery. These values are spoken to through the design and architecture of Bitcoin itself; as well as how those working on it have described it.\n\nNow-- onto the operation of the Bitcoin software itself. A bitcoin node contains a complete implementation of the _entire_ bitcoin system, each one embodies the complete machinery, each node knows every rule. The way a Bitcoin node works is that it receives information from peers but it never trusts any of it.   When information comes in, the node verifies the data as if it were creating it itself from scratch or as if its worst enemy were creating it. If a single piece is not precisely right according to the rules of the system it discards it as though it never happened (and in modern software it also bans the source; though that is just an "optimization" to reduce the time lost verifying bad information from malicious peers).  In these respect, a node can never be tricked; it is your agent-- a mechanical attorney--  which tirelessly assures your autonomy and achieves that "no matter what" described above. There is no voting with respect to this stuff, no democracy (where a majority might vote to take a minorities assets for themselves), just autonomy from mathematical rules; carried out with (hopefully) mechanical perfection.\n\nUnfortunately, there is a catch-- however:  We don\'t want coins to be permitted to be spent twice; so if there are multiple spends we must decide which dominates. Relatively precludes there existing a natural universal ordering: nodes located at different locations may necessarily see transactions in different order. We\'re perfectly able to decide for ourselves which we saw first but our decisions can be different from the honest decisions of others. We\'d like to be able to trade coins with other parties, so we actually have to come to an agreement.  We could vote; but whomever controls the voter rolls could just rig the election; online voting generally doesn\'t work; and this was basically where the dream of a decentralized cryptocurrency was stuck before Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin introduced the concept of miners, miners serve exclusively one purpose-- jointly time-stamping transactions in a way which is costly to forge so that everyone can come to an agreement  about what order things happened in; some have described mining as a multiparty threshold signature where the parties are anonymous and not set out in advance. Bitcoin actually works fine without mining in all respects except the consensus ordering; e.g. you can start a single node and so long as everyone uses it as a client, you can just use zero-conf transactions in its mempool, no blocks, and transact securely (so long as you trust the node operator to not reorder things on you!); the formats of transactions make no references to blocks at all (except for the "height" locktime, which was soft-forked in after release).   Miners are strictly limited: they include and order transactions. That is their only authorty.  To incentivize the necessarily expensive mining, the initial coins and transaction fees (added in quite close to Bitcoin\'s publication) are issued to them.  Miners are a big compromise to autonomy, but we know no other way; and the damage they can do is limited by the fact that their remit is so narrow.\n\nSo under what conditions is Bitcoin secure? Bitcoin is secure if the node the user is using is faithful (follows the rules and protects the users interests), if a majority of hash-power is faithful, and if this faithful majority and the user are not partitioned (they can communicate)--- any number of additional malicious users can be added, without harm, if these criteria are met.  So then it\'s natural to ask "why is this hash-power faithful?" and the answer is that it is limited in what it can do, and its actions are costly; so it is hard for them to gain by being breaking the rules.\n\nSo -- going back to why not uncap miners and let them do whatever they want?   To do so would be for the users to disarm themselves, and instead trust miners not merely to order things where we have no choice but to be faithful in many other respects as well where previously they were rigorously forced by the machinery of the system; reintroducing trust in places where it had been replaced by machinery.  In order to mitigate policy risk (e.g. being coerced to censor transactions) miners are self-selecting, ephemeral, and anonymous in the system; they\'re not exactly the kinds of parties you should want to trust because you have little recourse if they do wrong (and any recourse makes it possible to use them to do wrong).  Trusting miners _more_ is immediately a reduction of security and autonomy which is bad in principle, but it may also undermine the incentives miners had to be faithful at all-- with more possible ways to misbehave perhaps some of ways of cheating may be profitable.\n\nFor example, miners (or parties that captured them for this purpose) could lobby the public that inflation of the Bitcoin currency would be good for the economy, and while most might disapprove, if their introduction of inflation didn\'t quickly drive the Bitcoin price to zero, their increased income from adding more coins could be quite profitable; shifting value to them while taking a little from everyone else. In such a situation they may not effectively check themselves because they\'ve been prevented by political capture or simply because they all have an interest in common (and at odds with all non-mining Bitcoin owners).  These are concerns that are simply moot with appropriate limits in place.  Basically, doing so takes a part of our hen-house that had impenetrable security and replacing it with a rope and asking the foxes to guard it; then hoping that the fact that if they empty the hen-house they\'ll be no more eggs for them is enough to prevent them from doing so.\n\nFor blocksize the concerns are similar though the specifics of the failure modes are different. The issue there is difficult because "X MB" is not a "scale free" parameter like 21 million bitcoin is... A megabyte means something in the real world; but what it means changes over time as CPUs and access to bandwidth change (as well as tolerance for how costly Bitcoin is to operate, no one would have accepted the current costs on day 1 when Bitcoins had a value of zero); but access to these things doesn\'t change equally fast for all users; and even if it did we can\'t have the system itself measure it ... so even saying that it should be "constant relative to the technology" isn\'t something that we could bake in or even decide easily by hand. \n\nSo-- Going back to your description;  it seems like you\'ve been thinking of Bitcoin as a democracy where the miners are the Citizens; entitled to vote; and that we can use Bitcoin by their good graces-- but like good feudal lords, it\'s in their general interest to be benevolent, so as to avoid a revolt (abandoning Bitcoin);  would this flowery description be vaguely right?\n\nMy view is that democracy is just one of the best of many possible systems to decide how to permit some people to push other people around-- it\'s not actually good; it\'s just in the many cases where there is a genuine conflict of rights there is nothing better available.  In Bitcoin, in particular, we\'ve replaced most of the trust with machinery; and without the trust we have eliminated most of the need for anything like democracy and achieved something with much more autonomy. Technical necessity demands we compromise this ideal with mining, but only in the narrowest possible sense; and the mining compromise is tolerable in large part because of how limited it is.  Another way to look at it is miners are untrustworthy parties with some dangerous power but the power is balanced by limitations and checked by everyone else enforcing those limits.\n\nIf Bitcoin were a more democratic instead of autonomous system I wouldn\'t think it a very good democracy-- virtually all of the users are disenfranchised, and the Citizens aren\'t likely parties we\'d choose as representatives.  The most of the popular fiat currencies used all over the world are the product of democractic political systems (and continue to exist at their mercy); the huge costs they create by requiring trust but being untrustworthy are part of what motivated the creation of Bitcoin. I don\'t want to create a poor emulation of that; I think we have something better, but to keep it better we must carefully avoid undermining the properties of it.\n\n> To me this strikes me as a community that verbally embraces a decentralized network and yet has very little faith in it\'s success\n\nI\'d suggest instead that we have experience and, as a result, great respect for how difficulty -- even nearly impossible-- the problem is; as is often the case for cryptographic problems.\n\nI\'m interested in hearing your thoughts on my take and how its consistent with or contrasts with your views.': 9, "> are of the view that a 2000% increase now, is at least inadvisable; and most appear to be of the view that controversial hardforks are generally not acceptable.\n\nThese two statements strike me as conflicts of each other.

At-market orders by definition don\'t have the price limit, it\'s filled at the best available market price. Imagine the top of book is a $100.00/$100.05. A retail at-market buy comes in. It would be filled at $100.05 if it hits the exchange, which is the best available offer.

E.g. the book is $100.00/$100.05, and a juicy retail buy comes in at $100.30 limit. On the exchange it\'d be filled at $100.05 and up, but preferential flow would let a MM fill it at $100.30 without it going to the market.\n\nWould this not be why you\'d buy the order flow in the first place?\n\n> You won\'t get filled until the MMs decide to pass it on (and by that time, the price is stale).\n\nAre you are saying a MM who bought the flow can delay your order from going to the exchange for an arbitrary period without filling it?\n\n> Its right there in the OP, pasted from itBit\'s ToS\n\nI was under the impression we were talking about real exchanges, not this dodgy bitcoin exchange.\n\n> Translation: the MMs, if they want to, can step in front of your standing limit orders.\n\nStill not following you.

But there are other market makers.

If it was an even playing field, they\'d have to compete with other MMs by posting better offers and narrowing the spread (which would mean less revenue on the round trip) *before* the market order arrives. Preferencing means they don\'t have to worry about competing with some other MM (or just a retail trader for that matter) putting better limit orders in front of theirs. They can just put their own limit order up at the very last moment, *after* the market order comes in (that\'s what i mean by stepping in front).\n\n> On the exchange it\'d be filled at $100.05 and up, but preferential flow would let a MM fill it at $100.30 without it going to the market.\n\nEven with preferencing, if the NBBO is $100.00/$100.05, then it should fill at $100.05. It\'d be illegal for the MM to sell at $100.30. The issue back in the 90\'s was that the MM\'s colluded (under Madoff\'s leadership) to keep the NBBO spread wide by never quoting at odd-eighths. Also, the SEC couldn\'t track the data, and with prices moving constantly, retail traders were never sure whether they actually got the NBBO price.\n\n> Are you are saying a MM who bought the flow can delay your order from going to the exchange for an arbitrary period without filling it?\n\nI\'m saying that you can use a limit order, fine it goes to the exchange. But just because its on the exchange doesn\'t mean it will get hit. To get filled, other market orders need to arrive. But the MMs are filtering all the market orders, stepping in front before they ever get to the exchange (even market orders from other brokers, they\'re just getting filtered by different MMs). Your limit order on the exchange will only get filled by toxic market orders that the MMs reject. \n\n> I was under the impression we were talking about real exchanges, not this dodgy bitcoin exchange.\n\nWe are, but its the same idea (preferencing / payment for order flow).\n\n> What do you mean by "step in front"? The only place I\'ve seen this terminology used is to mean one MM\'s quote stepping in front of another\'s quote. I.e. if the book is $100.10/$99.95, I can step in front of these quotes with $100.05/$100.00 respectively.\n\nYeah, but when you post a better offer, you have to do it *before* the market order arrives (and everyone else the chance to do the same). Preferencing means the MM can step in *after* the market order arrives. So you could have the best bid on the book, and it could sit there indefinitely. Meanwhile all kinds of market orders are arriving, but they\'re hitting the MM, not you. They won\'t hit you until its in the MM\'s interest to let them hit you.\n\n> Buying order flow is basically a roundabout way to do the same thing.\n\nYup, when HFT firms pay exchanges big money to colocate, it is just a higher-tech form of the same idea. The top-tier firms actually make most of their money from the retail brokers (eTrade, scottrade, fidelity, etc.), they pay much more for that retail order flow than what it costs to colocate at an exchange (hundreds of millions to buy retail order flow, compared to hundreds of thousands to colocate).\n\n> Do I feel all MMs should have equal access?
