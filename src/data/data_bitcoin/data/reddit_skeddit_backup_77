Right now the median cost of finding a block, whether it's empty or full is in the area of $10,000 USD.\n\nSo mining empty blocks is better than not mining at all, but generally speaking a miner will see the most profit if the stuff the blocks with as many txs as possible.": 1, "Yes they still get the 25 (soon to be 12.5) BTC reward for finding a block even if it's empty.

When header mining the block doesn't have to be empty it just has to not contain any transactions that were already included in the last block.\n\nSo sure you can make a rule that empty blocks are rejected by the network, but a miner could just generate new dust transactions from their own wallet to stuff the block with to meet any minimum block size.  They can even have large fees because they would just go back to that miner anyway.  Because these would be newly generated transactions, we already know they weren't in the last block.\n": 2, "When a new block is found it's transmitted to all nodes (including all other miners) on the network.  That process is not instantaneous though, there's a short period of time from when a miner receives the block header, and when it receives the full list of transactions in that block.\n\nDuring that period the miners would normally have to stop mining and wait for the rest of the block to download.  Rather then leave their equipment idle (and losing money) while the block downloads they instead start trying to mine an empty block on top the new block they haven't fully received yet.\n\nThey can't put transactions into that block until they know what transactions were in the last block because it would be rejected by the network if it contained transactions that were already on the chain.\n\n": 11, 'Do they get rewarded for discovering empty blocks?

Their only alternative would be to stop mining altogether during that time.": 1, 'If reward was zero, nobody would waste electricity mining empty blocks.\n\nAs reward reduces and fees take over, it will be less profitable to mine empty blocks rather than switching off mining for a few seconds to save the electricity cost of mining for those seconds.': 1, 'Nothing forces to include transactions in a block.

I'm not sure how that's implemented, so [I've asked a question here](http://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/q/43184/5406).": 3, "Getting back to you, somebody [answered the question](http://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/a/43190/5406). Essentially, the recipient gives a riddle that only he knows the solution of, and the sender initiates a chain of transactions that can only be redeemed with the riddle's solution.\n\nTo build on my previous example, Charles would tell you: The riddle is `1bc9852364a8aa073daedb3965716ab63d84570c645b091f535a3677010d9984`. You initiate a transaction to me, which can be can redeemed with the solution to the riddle, but is time locked to returned to you, if I don't solve within a few hours. In turn I'll offer a transaction with the same riddle to Alice, as Alice does to Bob, until finally Bob relays to Charles. Charles knows the solution to the riddle, and solves the transaction's riddle to get paid the money from Bob. Bob uses the riddle's solution to get the money from Alice, Alice solves my transaction, and I use the riddle's solution to get the money from you.\n\nThus, nobody can claim a payment before paying, but when paying gets the means to claim their payment in turn: The middlemen can't run with the money.": 3, 'This is actually an important point and one i wish could be further elaborated on.  Can you expand on this?  Thanks - many here want to learn alot more and this would help.': 6, 'How do I buy a coffee using lightning? ': 2, "Thank you so much for all the information! I'll have to get back to that stack exchange question later and see if it gets any answers.": 1, 'Say, you and I want to open a payment channel.\n\n1) **Putting funds into Lightning**  \nWe both send 0.05 BTC into a shared 2-of-2 multisig address. This requires a transaction on the Bitcoin blockchain.  \nAs a "balance sheet", we each create a 2-of-2 multisig transaction that pays out 0.05 BTC to you and 0.05 BTC to me. I sign one payout transaction and give it to you. If you want to put it in effect, you need only add your own signature and broadcast it to the Bitcoin network. Vice versa, you give me your copy of the payout transaction that you have signed and I have not yet. The "balance sheet" is a regular 2-of-2 multisig transaction in the Bitcoin network, it just isn\'t valid yet, because it doesn\'t have all signatures.\n\n2) **Payment**  \nNow I want to pay you 0.01 BTC. We each create a new payout transaction ("balance sheet") as before, but this one says that you get 0.06 BTC and I get 0.04 BTC. Each of us gets a transaction signed by the other to that effect.  \nTo make sure that neither of us can use the old payout transaction the other signed previously, we each create an "anti-cheat" transaction: It\'s a transaction that spends the outputs from our first payout transaction to the other.  \nI.e. when I try to activate the (now obsolete) 0.05 - 0.05 BTC balance sheet, you broadcast the "anti-cheat" transaction where I agreed that my 0.05 BTC output get send to you directly. This is safe for me to give to you (and the whole network), because the "anti-cheat" can only be activated as a response to the use of an old balance-sheet. (This anti-cheat mechanism is why Lightning needs the Transaction Malleability fix from Segregated Witness.)  \nWith the state as described above, I\'d have to be online to catch you trying to cheat, but obviously it wouldn\'t be safe for me to keep payment channels open, if I\'d have to remain online all the time. So, to encourage others to help with the "anti-cheat" transaction, we set a small portion of the "anti-cheat" payout as a bounty that anyone can sign. Now, we can send the anti-cheat transaction to all nodes on the network, and whoever wants to will watch for old balance-sheets being broadcasted. When it happens, they sign the bounty to themselves and broadcast the "anti-cheat".\n\n3) **Network payment**  \nAlright, now you and I can send money back and forth thousands of times, with instant effect, yet without adding a single transaction to the Bitcoin blockchain. Yet, on the other hand, if one of us ever tried to defraud the other, it would be instantly resolved on the blockchain to their own detriment. Pretty spiffy, but not terribly useful yet.  \nBy the theory of [six degrees of separation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_degrees_of_separation), everyone is connected to any other participant by only a few hops. \nLet\'s say you want to send money to Charles, who is a barista and just made you some coffee. Charles is a friend of Bob, and Bob is a friend of Alice, while I have a Payment channel with Alice. For illustration purposes, let\'s assume that each payment channel has two BTC in it, equal split. You do not have a direct connection to Charles.\n\nOur "network" now looks like this:  \n\n       snowkeld <-- 1BTC ----- 1BTC --> Xekyo <-- 1BTC ----- 1BTC --> Alice  <-- 1BTC ----- 1BTC --> Bob  <-- 1BTC ----- 1BTC --> Charles\n\nNow, since you don\'t have a direct payment channel to Charles (and it would be very inefficient if you had to create a payment channel with every business partner you ever meet), you have to route your payment through the network. Instead of only writing an update of the balance between Charles and you as I described above, this becomes a concerted effort: Your wallet finds a route from you to Charles that has a) sufficient liquidity, and b) least fees. To make a payment, each involved payment channel updates their balance. With a payment of 0.01 BTC for the coffee, this updates our network to:\n\n       snowkeld <-- 0.99BTC ----- 1.01BTC --> Xekyo <-- 0.99BTC ----- 1.01BTC --> Alice  <-- 0.99BTC ----- 1.01BTC --> Bob  <-- 0.99BTC ----- 1.01BTC --> Charles\n\nAs you can see, the balances at the ends have shifted appropriately from you to Charles, but the other participants have the same balance (although shifted to other payment channels). It\'s important to realize, that the transaction can only go through completely or not at all. Either we all update the balances, or no one does.\n\nNow, imagine that you don\'t have only the one payment channel with me, but you have maybe a dozen payment channels with other users. :)\n\n4) **Trade-offs**   \n\n * You cannot receive more money through Lightning in one transaction than the sum of your payment channel\'s value.\n * Your transactions don\'t get stored on the blockchain for eternity, (i.e. better payment privacy), but on the other hand you keep using the same address allowing users that know who the address belongs to to monitor your balance (less personal privacy).\n * Instant transactions! But your money is locked up in a payment channel, which you first need to execute on the blockchain if you want to do a regular Bitcoin transaction with the money.\n * Less fees! Transactions on Lightning don\'t require a full blockchain transaction fee, but if you route through others\' payment channels, they might want some for the liquidity they provide to you. As other Lightning nodes are competing to transfer your payment for you, this is likely to be much lower than a full transaction fee on the blockchain.': 4}, ('Brooklyn blockchain startup could render power companies redundant', 0): {}, ('Kurt Robinson hip hop set from Anarchapulco', 0): {}, ('Newbie needs help with reading this transaction ID please!', 13): {"The transaction is not confirmed, meaning it hasn't been added to the block chain.\n\nhttps://tradeblock.com/bitcoin/tx/6d51ab43dae8239a69ef16051a8b5b63304f5079bc8e1ff7ce238bfc95cf2e33\n\nNotice the fee density (fee/size=6.6 satoshis/byte) is too low for the current market.

It\'s impossible to completely block out transactions. To determine the cost of raising the "minimum fee" we look at how much fee transactions are currently paying.\n\n* 10 satoshi/byte: 99.16% of included transactions are paying this much or more. If you want to block transactions below 10 sat/byte you only need to pay 0.00084000 btc per block (~$50/day),which is almost nothing. In reality transactions below and maybe at this level are included for other reasons than their fee, such as miners own transactions, CPFP, priority or something else.\n* 20 satoshi/byte: 91.86% of included transactions are paying this much or more. If you want to block transactions below 20 sat/byte you need to pay 0.01628000 btc per block (~$1000/day), which is real money but not a ton.\n* 30 satoshi/byte: 75.86% of included transactions are paying this much or more. If you want to block transactions below 30 sat/byte you need to pay 0.07242000 btc per block (~$4500/day), starts to add up but still realistic.\n* 40 satoshi/byte: 66.79% of included transactions are paying this much or more. If you want to block transactions below 40 sat/byte you need to pay 0.13284000 btc per block (~$8200/day).\n* 50 satoshi/byte: 24.28% of included transactions are paying this much or more. If you want to block transactions below 50 sat/byte you need to pay 0.37860000 btc per block (~$23400/day). At this point it seems like a lot of money, but in a billion dollar industry it could still be very worth it if you think it is accomplishing your goals. This is what you would need to severely disrupt the network, as you would block out all the transactions between 200-250 byte with a 0.0001 fee.\n\nIt\'s worth mentioning, that it\'s unlikely that you would actually have to pay for 75% of the block space in the end. If you filled the mempool with 50 sat/byte transactions, people who really needed to send a transaction would start paying 51 sat/byte. Exactly how many people would be willing to raise their fees is more or less impossible to predict so the actual cost for an attack is hard to estimate.\n\nI\'m not certain exactly what fees the spammers are currently using in the attack. Since transactions with only 10 or 20 sat/byte are still getting through it would seem the majority of the mempool is below this level, possibly as low as the minimum relay fee of 0.00005000. Still, it seems transactions with 30-40 sat/byte are being included slower than usual, so there is also an increased amount of transactions above this level. The spam transactions were spread out over time, the mempool did not instantly rise to the highest level, and they may also have been spread out across fee levels.': 6, 'I haven\'t seen any analysis of the actual attack that was done, but in general: To make it impossible for anyone to get a transaction through with a fee less than $x per kB, an attacker needs to pay roughly 1000 kB * $x per block. So to raise the required fee to $1/kB requires $1000 in fees per block.\n\nIdeally, wallets should notice this and say, "There\'s a spam attack going on. You can either pay this above-average fee to outbid the attacker or you can wait a while." Also, wallets should support RBF and/or CPFP to allow people to adjust fees after transaction creation. But in reality, most wallets just pay some constant fee, which is what caused most of the trouble in this case. (Bitcoin Core has a fee estimator, though it doesn\'t warn about spam attacks specifically, and it doesn\'t yet allow adjusting fees easily.)\n\nIf the max block size is doubled, then the cost to raise the required fee to a certain level is also roughly doubled. So when SegWit increases the effective max block size to ~2 MB around April, this attack will become more expensive. But if wallets use a fixed fee, then it still won\'t require all that much money to fill blocks with slightly-above-average fees. Fee estimation is required in any case.\n\nFurthermore, I\'ve seen a number of people saying stuff like, "If there\'s an attack, then the max block size should be able to increase arbitrarily to absorb it." This is a very misinformed statement. Obviously both miners (in some cases) and people who make transactions want larger blocks, but the larger blocks are on average, the more expensive it is to run a full node in terms of bandwidth, CPU usage, and disk space. And full nodes do not (and, most experts believe, cannot reasonably) get any reward for supporting increased transaction volume. So in other words, block size is a negative externality suffered by full nodes due to the actions of miners and transaction-makers, and running full nodes is a positive externality provided by full nodes to the benefit of everyone who uses Bitcoin (Bitcoin is absolutely insecure if not enough of the economy is backed by full nodes). And there\'s no reason to think that miners or transaction-makers would voluntarily keep blocks small enough -- since it\'s a common goods problem, neither has the right incentives. Bitcoin\'s solution to this issue is for full nodes to enforce a max block size small enough to allow full nodes to operate with a reasonably low cost. Removing the limit would make spam attacks even worse, since spammers would be able to directly attack Bitcoin\'s volunteer full nodes (and therefore Bitcoin\'s *decentralization*) rather than just increase fees temporarily.': 4, "About the current backlog.
