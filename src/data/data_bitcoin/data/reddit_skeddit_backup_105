It is yet another weapon in their arsenal.\n\nOf course it will not necessarily play out that way, it could be that the policy is to prepare for lend to businesses that will be impacted by the coming minimum wage hike, businesses that in order to stay competitive will take out loans to reduce the impact of a price hikes on their customers.

Http being port 80 and https port 443. This means if a site admin truly desires (not that they would) could have a different site served over http than the https version. \n\n Ideally a server enforcing https will be set up to have no page render for the http request and will then preform a 301 redirect (http status code for url permanently moved update all links) to the https url with requested file path. This is why when you type in a url absent the https part if the site enforces https then it will automatically redirect your http request. The issue here is that if you visited a malicious server the redirect would never happen and you'd be attacked in http.\n\nThe solution to this is adding a HSTS header to the https site. This adds a super cookie of sorts to your browser for a set period of time (usually 6 months to a year) that tells the browser to automatically always use the https version for that URL even if the http version is requested. This solves the ability to attack the initial http request by preventing said request in the first place. The problem with HSTS however is that before the browser can save it it must have made the http request initially and be redirected. This opens up the user to attack especially more so in TOR as the use of private browsing means that HSTS is removed after each session. So it is only valid for said session. \n\nTo solve this problem HSTS preloading has been implemented in browsers. This is a white list that contains a list of sites to always use HSTS for without having to preform the initial http request (should a user not preform a https request to start with). Thing is a site must be added to these lists by its admins and browser must support said list and be updated to have newest whitelist. \n\nHttps everywhere (which TOR includes by default) performs HSTS like functionality for sites that don't support it and are in HTTPS Everywhere whitelist. In addition to this it's function  is to force https on sites that do not enforce it and allow users to use either http or https. \n\nEdit: Bitmixer.io does not support HSTS at all although it does preform a redirect from http to https as explained above this isn't helpful should the http request be man in the middled. So add it to your HTTPS whitelist to prevent http requests. ": 3, 'Ironically they probably use the funds and use the mixing service they are impersonating to get them to a central address.

Through the use of Namecoin DNS records can be stored decentralized absent the need of trust in root servers, then necessary signatures to validate certificates can be embedded directly within the DNS records. DNSSEC would need to be used to validate the DNS records to be legit. Then since using a regular recursive DNS server access this would be a security vulnerability as trust would be needed in it. So you'd have to run a Namecoin node on your home network and have all devices preform DNS queries over your LAN directly too it. Although I suppose you could use a third parties recursive DNS server so long as it relays DNSSEC info and your clients (or LAN cache on router) can then validate the signatures therefore speeding up DNS queries. Now no need for a trusted third party as a network is used that requires no trust in order to function. We'd still be able to use TLS just the same but would change the flawed part which is the need of trust in a third party to validate certificates.

That\'s why I have a hard time to trust these incompatible fork attempts since motivations, affiliations and communications are intransparent and obscure.

As a programmer, I find SW very interesting, and potentially a good idea that should be studied more before implemented.  Regardless, neither it "fast" nor "safe" I\'d attribute.  From an engineering perspective, it\'s a massive, high risk code change.  This *should* take a long time, with lots of review, lots of testing. Fast-tracking a change like this is a terrible idea from people who don\'t understand good engineering principles.  From a political perspective, I feel like its "need" is closely tied to the "need" for RBF, a highly-contentious and disruptive BIP that solves the problem for a very powerful few by creating potential problems for the voiceless many.  Security-thinking, we all have one basic fear: centralization.  Anti-Classic (because I\'m going to be equally political here) proponents are scared that Big Blocks will create a technological centralization.  I don\'t buy this, because I see who the opponents are, and see that 2MB would be a minor blow against decentralization that would be overcome within six to twelve months just due to the nature of technology and the economic conditions in nations like China.  Anti-Core proponents fear the centralization of development, unilateral decision as to where and why bitcoin develops.  This is where I fall, and this is something I feel is extremely "unsafe."  So, long story short, SW is not "objectively the fastest and safest proposal."\n\n> Fighting SegWit at this point looks more like desperately looking for arguments to discredit our most trusted and most valuable contributors.\n\nThis statement is 100% opinion, and a direct appeal to emotion.  Our "most trusted and valuable" political figures, for example, are still doing quite a lot to screw over folks like you and I, friend, so lending them an air of credibility based on personal feelings does no one any good.  The Core team has done a lot for us, and hopefully will continue to do so in the future.  This does not mean that they are infallible or incorruptible.  As I\'ve said before, when a side starts to use political patriotism, censorship, and fear tactics to forward their goals, their agendas and motivations need to be scrutinized.\n\n> [bigger blocks] does not make Bitcoin any more able to scale.\n\nIn engineering, we have two principle means of "scaling:"  1) Changing code to be more efficient, 2) throwing more resources at it.  Despite the initial emotional reaction against #2, both are valid and worth-while means of responding to demand.  In fact, Amazon Web Services bases their whole infrastructure on it.  When demand increases, for example, AWS will rapidly spin up new machines to handle the load.  Increasing block size is an equivalent.  It\'s low risk (technologically speaking), and (aside from hard-fork fears, which, really, we\'ve gone through a hard fork before, and if it were pushed through with the same fervor and unanimity, we shouldn\'t have to fear future forks) extremely safe, and very fast to do.  Does this eliminate the need for a #1-like solution, something akin to SW?  No, but neither does having a code change eliminate the need for expanded resources.

As people upgrade to SW, signatures are kept "to the side" (sort of) for SW transactions.   Only to the extent that wallets and other transaction generating applications move to the SW format will blocks be reduced in size.\n\nSince legacy code (not upgraded to SW) will only download the blocks without signatures included, blocks will be able to hold more transactions.  The downside is that these new SW outputs look like "Anyone can spend" outputs, so transactions spending SW outputs cannot be validated by old software.\n\nBut this is a soft fork.  That means (while old software can\'t validate these transactions, and miners that do not upgrade cannot validate transactions or properly build blocks anymore) everyone continues to see the same longest chain of PoW.\n\n**tl;dr**  Everyone gets the same blocks.

Any miner imposing restrictions on the number of legacy transactions they include in blocks will contribute to this effect. If the uptake goes too slowly, it's bound to happen to some degree. I just hope they'll refrain from completely cutting service to legacy transactions.\n\nI can't imagine a situation where a block size hard fork would materialize faster than SW can. SW, however, has the advantage that it's benefits can materialize before we have a supermajority whereas a block size hard fork cannot change anything before gaining a supermajority.\n\nI have every reason to believe miners will do everything in their power to push the adoption of SW forward if the capacity limits star t causing serious problems. It's in their interests to keep Bitcoin working, afterall.\n\nThere is unfortunately a lot of bad argumentation from supporters of both sides. Anyway, do you have an example of a Bitcoin Business model that can't be easily adapted to work with the Lightning Network?\n\nI didn't take LN too seriously until recently, myself. However, now that I've actually done some reading about it, I'm now convinced it can be implemented and adopted in time to help Bitcoin scale a few of orders of magnitude larger. SW will remove the last technical problems that have been blocking LN's implementation.\n\nThere's been some attempted FUD about the lack of concrete routing algorithm for LN being published. However, routing is a research field with over 30 years of research into it. The internet itself couldn't exist without working routing algorithms. The biggest task is figuring out which of the existing algorithms is the best match and adapting it for use in LN. It won't even require any kind of consensus to work, so future upgrades are simple.\n\nIt won't remove the need for larger block sizes, but it'll allow for a few more years of exponential growth before that's required. In addition to this, LN transactions also have instant confirmation and the potential for much improved privacy (this depends a lot on the routing algorithms chosen), which will make Bitcoin a much easier to sell.\n": 1, 'It\'s not easy to get the words for what\'s on my tongue ... \n\n>It is difficult to judge this based on online activity as this can so easily be faked.\n\nYes, absolutely.

I don't hear any arguments against SW security that do not amount to FUD (with the slight exception of damage to 0 confirmations by non SW clients).\n\nThe arguments against a 2 MB hard fork are nearly all FUD, or based in a view of Bitcoin's purpose that is okay with shedding use cases for Bitcoin even if that means breaking existing business models.": 1, ">Yes, miners have the power to essentially make SW closer to a hard fork if they choose to do so in high enough numbers. Any miner imposing restrictions on the number of legacy transactions they include in blocks will contribute to this effect. If the uptake goes too slowly, it's bound to happen to some degree. I just hope they'll refrain from completely cutting service to legacy transactions.\n\nA hard fork occurs when the longest proof of work is in dispute.  Omitting transactions does not cause a hard fork.\n\n>I can't imagine a situation where a block size hard fork would materialize faster than SW can. SW, however, has the advantage that it's benefits can materialize before we have a supermajority whereas a block size hard fork cannot change anything before gaining a supermajority.\n\nSW requires a super majority.  That is because while old code miners will accept SW blocks, the reverse is not true, because old code won't properly record and validate SW transactions.  SW would require a hard fork to reverse back out.\n\n>I have every reason to believe miners will do everything in their power to push the adoption of SW forward if the capacity limits star t causing serious problems. It's in their interests to keep Bitcoin working, afterall.\n\nOf course.  This is why they literally and repeatedly called for a blocksize increase.\n\n>There is unfortunately a lot of bad argumentation from supporters of both sides. Anyway, do you have an example of a Bitcoin Business model that can't be easily adapted to work with the Lightning Network?\n\nColored coins, Counterparty, payment processors, merchants, all will not have options for growth soon, or can't use lightning networks. \n\nLN is at least months if not years away from having enough infrastructure, users, and merchants from being a real alternative.\n\nLightning networks will require low fees and space in blocks to launch and establish value as a network.  SW won't be in place nor yield enough space to launch LN by itself.\n\n>I didn't take LN too seriously until recently, myself. However, now that I've actually done some reading about it, I'm now convinced it can be implemented and adopted in time to help Bitcoin scale a few of orders of magnitude larger. SW will remove the last technical problems that have been blocking LN's implementation.\n\nSW and LN are the future.  If we have a protocol and market position when they come on line.\n\n>There's been some attempted FUD about the lack of concrete routing algorithm for LN being published. However, routing is a research field with over 30 years of research into it. The internet itself couldn't exist without working routing algorithms. The biggest task is figuring out which of the existing algorithms is the best match and adapting it for use in LN. It won't even require any kind of consensus to work, so future upgrades are simple.\n\nThe internet took years to develop.  As did Facebook.  Phones took decades.  As did point of sale solutions.  \n\nNone of this happens fast.  Meanwhile back on the ranch, Bitcoin transactions double every year. And blocks are filling up now.\n\n>It won't remove the need for larger block sizes, but it'll allow for a few more years of exponential growth before that's required. In addition to this, LN transactions also have instant confirmation and the potential for much improved privacy (this depends a lot on the routing algorithms chosen), which will make Bitcoin a much easier to sell.\n\nWalk me through a LN transaction.  What does a user/merchant do to set up a channel?  Will a merchant risk locking up funds with a customer? What software is the merchant running for point of sale?  What is the customer running?  Where?  How does axxounting work? How do the monitor they channels? If breaking down a channel costs too much, how are small  transactions justified?  What if users need money in a channel, but the other party is offline or non-responsive?\n\nThe big one is money service, money transmission business regulation.  When routing funds, each node is transmitting value between two other parties.  Will this be legal?  Why?  And even if it is somehow, will merchants accept the risk?\n\nAll this (even if there are answers) takes the to market and adopt.  And the plan is for this to grow faster than Bitcoin?  Right out of the gate?  Really?\n\n": 1, 'Ah so you think you are smarter than all the active current Bitcoin developers combined who clearly prefer SegWit over a blocksize limit increase at this moment in time?

Compound that with the idea that you have to upgrade pretty much the entire bitcoin infrastructure to understand these new transactions and there is a ton of code everywhere that has to be updated, tested, and vetted. By comparison a blocksize increase is a few lines of code, and can be simulated heavily in many environments and doesn't change any fundamental aspects of operation. It also provided significant breathing room while we work on and test all of the other things that need to be done to improve the network. Preferring SegWit to a blocksize increase is not a sound engineering decision.": -3, 'I mean-- _I_ believe that... it is the fastest and safest proposal to date.

Objectively SegWit is the fastest and safest proposaI so far and does also fix urgent issues and lots of technical debt. So why should anyone (informed) be against it?\n\nOne problem with SegWit is that it is being implemented as a soft fork, leaving non-upgraded nodes in the dark about the new transaction data structure. Another problem, as I see it, is that it only provides an increase in scalability or possible transaction throughput if, and only if, a large portion of the network starts using complex scripts (nLockTimeVerify, P2SH, etc.) as well as implement SegWith in their software. If deployed as a soft fork we will see lower increases in scalability than if it is deployed as a hard fork. However, Core developers seem extremely vary of implementing it as a hard fork for various reasons. My feeling is that they do not want to deploy it as a hard fork because they know it would not be able to gain consensus in the developer community and not among the economic majority and miners. \n\nEDIT: for those downvoting me - it would be great to receive some explanation for why. Is there something incorrect in my comment?

Also technical experts like Nick Szabo and others are of the same opinion. In any case it doesn't sound like a good idea to go for a hard fork when there are so many against it. The more practical thing to do here would be to deploy SegWit and other scalability improvements first and then go for a hard fork. Scalability > Scaling seems more logical to me than the other way around. Anyway I don't really care I just want us to move forward and stop fighting. So sick of this crap, everyone involved is invested in Bitcoin and wants it to scale.": 2, "That's pretty much the point. That's the very difference between soft and hard fork.\nSoft fork --> upgrade if you want the improvements.\nHard Fork -> Upgrade or stop using.\n\nThe only way to get all the scaling benefits immediately is for nearly everyone to upgrade at the same time. This is the requirement for a successful hard fork.\n\nHowever, your criticism of SW as a capacity upgrade is based on assuming it's not possible to get everyone to upgrade fast enough for the upgrade to materialize in time.\n\nIn other words, it looks to me like you're saying we need to hard fork because we can't persuade people to upgrade fast enough. This makes no sense. You can't successfully hard fork if that's the case.\n\nSW allows a partial capacity increase even when not everyone upgrades, whereas a hard fork size increase only ever materializes if everyone upgrades.\n\nBy the way, miners naturally have an incentive to prioritize SW transactions in the event of congestion. They make more profit that way and it's better for bitcoin exchange rate development.\n\nthe benefit from SW transactions does not fall equally for those who don't use it. There is some benefit, but the most benefit can be had by upgrading. If you upgrade, you can get both a lower fee and more priority for your transactions than with legacy transactions. Simply because the same amount of fee gets you almost double the priority. So you could, for example choose to pay 30% lower fee for 40% more priority when you move to SW. or 50% lower fee for the same priority. Or the same old fees for double priority.\n\nYou can of course get the same priority with legacy transactions if you pay more fees but ... well... wouldn't you rather upgrade if possible?\n": 2, 'Coercive but not necessarily manipulative. \n\nOffering a block size increase is what it is.

SW reduces the apparent transaction size to legacy code, and changes the math for SW code.   My transaction doesn\'t really increase or decrease transaction volume statistically.  And my transaction has no impact on transaction size statistically.   So my use of SW doesn\'t make my transaction significantly easier to put in a block if the volume is way higher than the blocksize allows (unless we add code that puts old transactions "at the end of the line" by miners;  possible, doable, and maybe even a good idea that makes your statement true, but hasn\'t been discussed as far as I have heard).  \n\nOnly if everyone uses SW do we get the full benefit of SW, and if everyone else is using it, I get the same benefit as everyone else if I use SW or I do not.

Objectively SegWit is  the fastest and safest proposaI so far and does also fix urgent issues and lots of technical debt. So why should anyone (informed) be against it? The discourse looks not to be about scaling, but about political control. Heavy disagreement can be very constructive as long as everyone genuinely wants to find the best solution. Fighting SegWit at this point looks more like desperately looking for arguments to discredit our most trusted and most valuable contributors.
