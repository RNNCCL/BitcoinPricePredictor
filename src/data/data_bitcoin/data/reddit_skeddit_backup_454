This a new paradigm government is losing its grip on humanity. Just smile and wave. ': 2, 'Well, as always, the first step is to agree on your definitions. Borrowing heavily here from an old comment of mine.  When I google "define fiat currency" here are the first five results.\n\nFrom wikipedia:\n>Fiat money is money that derives its value from government regulation or law.\n\nFrom investopedia:\n>Currency that a government has declared to be legal tender, despite the fact that it has no intrinsic value and is not backed by reserves. Historically, most currencies were based on physical commodities such as gold or silver, but fiat money is based solely on faith.\n\nFrom businessdictionary.com:\n>Common type of currency issued by official order, and whose value is based on the issuing authority\'s guarantee to pay the stated (face) amount on demand, and not on any intrinsic worth or extrinsic backing. All national currencies in circulation, issued and managed by the respective central banks, are fiat currencies.\n\nFrom thefreedictionary.com:\n>Money that is not backed by anything other than a government trust. Fiat money has no intrinsic value; it only has value at all because all participants in an economy agree to trust the government issuing the currency. All modern money is fiat money. While deflation is possible for fiat money, it is much more susceptible to inflation.\n\nFrom dictionary.com:\n>paper currency made legal tender by a fiat of the government, but not based on or convertible into coin.\n\nEach of those definitions includes the idea of government, but they don\'t all include the idea of a lack of "intrinsic value."  ("Intrinsic value" is sort of a nonsensical term because all value is subjective, so it\'s probably more useful to think in terms of "non-exchange value". In other words, when someone claims that something has "intrinsic value," generally what they really mean is that some of the demand for that item is from people who want to use it for some non-exchange / non-monetary purpose.)  I suppose you *could* define "fiat currency" as currency that has no "intrinsic value," (i.e., currency that has no non-monetary usefulness, without reference to whether or not that currency has any kind of official government status).  And maybe that\'s how many people (including some self-described "economists") DO use the term.  But clearly there are a large number of people who use and understand the term "fiat" to refer to money that derives its value solely from government decree.  Which definition is "right"? Both. Neither. Language belongs to its users.  (But I\'d note that based on the above admittedly-extremely-preliminary research, my definition does appear to be the more widely used one.) What\'s more interesting to me is the fact that this distinction has probably never been that important.  My guess is that there are very few / no examples of a market adopting an "intrinsically-worthless" currency in the absence of government coercion. \n\nAnother reason that I personally don\'t consider bitcoin to be "fiat" money is because it has much more in common with commodity money.  A bitcoin\'s value, assuming competing suppliers, is equal to its marginal cost of production -- something that is also true for commodities.  And it\'s for that reason that some have called it "quasi-commodity money."': 1, 'I completely disagree. How long will it take for any government to get their own blockchain up and running ? 5-10 years? During that time Bitcoin will continue to grow and become more useful.

They both have properties of good money, which give them value: fungibility, scarcity, durability, etc.\n\n"Backing" is something an otherwise worthless thing requires for it to have value. That is, paper with some numbers printed on it is otherwise worthless, so it needs to be backed by men with guns or something naturally valuable like gold, silver, and now, bitcoin.': 3, "Right, the convenience factor is great.  However, I think that if this kind of technology is implemented, it will not be Bitcoin and will instead be spearheaded by major economic powers like the US, China, and EU, who will create a blockchain and have all possible coins mined then do basically an IPO at a set value (most likely based on USD) for people and companies to purchase. There will probably be incentives to adopt early and then eventually conventional currency will be phased out in favor of the new system.  And as is the nature of governments there will be just as much, if not more, regulation on this new currency.  There will also be issues with how to print bills that are associated with x value of currency, because let's face it, I don't want to have to pull out my phone to buy a pack of gum.\n\nTL;DR: the convenience is great now, but if a bitcoin analog is going to be adopted as the primary currency it will be subject to the same frustrating regulations and transaction delays between countries that our national currency does today.

There is a ton of additional cost to this system, and little (if any) advantage.\n  \n>You don't see a need for hospitals to have a common agreement on a patients health history? x\n  \nI don't see why this needs distributed consensus to achieve.  What is the equivalent of a double spend for medical records?  Are people creating simultaneous fake medical histories across the world?

As long as there are bids at a premium to the net asset value of the bitcoin held by the fund, you will see long-term holders selling to new buyers, if only because they can then buy more directly from the fund or buy bitcoin directly at cost. So those long-term holders can earn money even if they feel like keeping their position, but that\'s a one-time quasi-arbitrage. There aren\'t many shares, and each share has an incentive to trade hands once and only once (from long term holder to new buyer) under the current mechanics of the fund. \n\nBut because new shares can\'t quickly enter the market due to the 12-month lockup period, supply will be *extremely* constrained and the market is going to be illiquid. There\'s just no way around it given the mechanics of an OTC traded fund like this - it\'s not like an ETF where supply can expand and everyone who wants a piece of the action can get it without sending the price badly out of alignment with the fund\'s NAV.\n\nSo yes, large lots of shares will move now and then, but celebrating a "new daily volume record" after seeing almost no shares trade yesterday is a bit disingenuous.

Review sections are generally date-stamped only to the day, and often only go back so far, so you only get sales for the last X days and you have to merge and deal with overlaps. The product mix also changes over time: the first sellers onto any market are usually digital goods sellers (like porn subscriptions) and maybe some relatively cheap drugs like marijuana, and then later on you start seeing things like opiates and sellers who have decided to trust a market with escrow for big orders like 1kg of cocaine, so going from 0->100 sellers is not the same as going from 100->200 sellers. Seller listings disappear when sellers do exit scams, so depending on how often you scrape, you can wind up being given a misleading picture; for example, if you had scraped SR2 in November 2014 and calculated average stars for reviews, your average would be biased upwards by easily half a star and your revenue estimate biased downwards by many thousands of dollars simply because SR2 was a notorious scammer-haven and only the non-scammers were present in your scrape. E-book sellers routinely try to put in dozens or even hundreds of listings if a market will let them get away with it, essentially spamming searches/categories, which screws up any count. And speaking of SR2, they may have been manipulating their listing counts in the first place - one of my collaborators, using my SR2 scrapes, tells me that the category-total number (which was usually ~12k in Nov 2014) seems to have usually overstated by several thousand how many listings there actually were, although we're not sure if it was yet another SR2 bug (perhaps some caching or counting issue) or incompleteness of the crawl or deliberate to make SR2 seem more important compared to its competitors Evo & Agora.\n\nSo, \\# of listings on a single day is an OK way of measuring growth and comparing markets, but I would not call it 'almost perfect'.

If it's longer than the public chain the rest of the network was working on, the public chain will be discarded and the selfish miner will collect all the rewards. Intuitively, I don't think it poses much threat, since the rest of the network stands a pretty good chance of catching up to this one miner.": 2, "Yeah it's dumb\n\nWith selfish mining, the attacker keeps the block to itself and mines on top of it without exposing it to the network.

This would allow them to publish their block at roughly the same time and still have a chance to get the block reward in a situation where mining selfishly didn't work. Again, I'm not sure if this is correct.": 4, ">Intuitively, I don't think it poses much threat\n\nIntuition is often wrong in these cases, and actual math in the selfish mining paper shows that if the miner is large enough, he is unstoppable and will make more money than his fair share.\n\n": 2, "I don't follow you.

Maybe he solves block X+1 or X+2 in that time if he\'s lucky.

There exists a general demand from society that you should *want* to work.\n\nThat\'s a really oppressive attitude as it feeds the notion that work is something that should be created (politicians will stand on a plank of "creating jobs") rather than eliminated.\n\n/u/vexing_vor\'s comments about "unlimited time off" specifically seem correct. The specific wording in the original post was "unlimited paid time off". That simply can\'t be right and it\'s the lack of clarity about what that could mean, given that it can\'t be literally true, that causes the problems.\n\nConditions of employment would be far more relaxing if the expectation of how much time you could take off was well defined (and generous). E.g. Standard working hours are 30 per week; you get 12 weeks off, paid, per year for any reason (sickness or holiday); If you work less than 30 hours per week on any one week you can make up for it in another; If you work over 30 hours per week you can take excess hours off in another week; You can take unpaid leave for 2 years, if you have worked at the company for 2 years or more; ....\n\nChange the variables (hours per week, week off per year) as you see fit, but change them in a defined way to set expectations. \n\nFor although it is entirely true that results are not always correlated with hours worked, somebody can invent something that yields an enormous productivity gain, they generally are so correlated. Hours worked seems like the best proxy we have for being clear on the level of effort we expect to be put into a project or task. \n\nBeing clear about the hours helps everyone. It helps the business plan based on labour costs; helps employees plan their time off; helps employees trade hours with each other in a way that maintains the operation.\n\nAs \xc5\xbdi\xc5\xbeek is suggesting: let\'s not hide the fundamental nature of the employer/employee relationship where one is paying the other for labour. That is quite different to when volunteers come together with an equal financial stake in the project (as business partners do when forming a company; or as friends do when going on holiday; or programmers do when working unpaid on an open source project).\n': 1, "But there's never a time when you're not busy.\n\nIn my job, I try to hire software engineers.

The same is true of "unlimited sick days."\n\nI noticed this in the past.  When there are "unlimited sick days," people hesitate to use them because there is no limit and therefore it is assumed your boss will dislike you for taking advantage of the policy.  People come to work sick and spread viruses throughout the office.  Exactly the same happens when there are zero sick days - people still want to get paid, so they come in, accomplish little, and infect everyone.  In both places, people who were out sick were frowned upon after a day.\n\nWhen there are a set number of sick days, however, people plan their usage.  If they tend to have serious illnesses, then they save the sick days for those illnesses.  Healthier people stay home when they have colds.  Either way, nobody thinks twice if someone is out sick.  Everyone knows that everyone else has a certain number of days, and therefore, they are treated the same as they are.\n\nI would never want to work at a company that has "unlimited vacation days."  I bet that very few people there take more than two weeks of vacation.

": 1, 'Unfortunately, it doesn\'t mean much at all and I\'d argue that "unlimited time off" is toxic.\n\nIt\'s not unlimited. If nobody is taking time off, then you\'re not going to take time off. If you *feel* like you\'re behind in work, then you\'re not going to take time off. If you don\'t see people taking time off, then you\'re not going to take time off. If there\'s no actual culture for utilizing that "unlimited time off", then you\'re not going to take time off.\n\nBy the time the company wisens up and forces employees to actually utilize the vacation, they might as well just have required and finite vacation.\n\n"Unlimited time off" sounded amazing until I had experience in companies with it. You look around and just see a lot of people that need to take time off but they won\'t due to even the perception of guilt or peer pressure. And by the time you need a vacation the most, your performance has started to falter and you\'re the *least* likely to take time off.\n\n> All it means is "get your work done".\n\nBut I\'ve given you 40 hours of work in your 40 hour work week.

They are designed to determine whether a person can think, not whether the person is an expert at computer science.  To that end, I ask questions about things like basic object inheritance, a brain teaser about sorting, a traveling salesman problem to see if the person recognizes that there is no optimal solution, the Monty Hall Paradox, and so on.\n\nThe goal is to find people who haven\'t done rote memorization of online courses.  The questions have been designed to present difficult problems to people and see if they can reason their way through them.  The second critical design for the questions is that if the person fails to reason their way through the questions, he stops and apologizes to admit he doesn\'t know the answer.  When a candidate lies and talks about how he was just discussing the problem last night but forgot what his friend told him about it, that\'s an automatic disqualifier.\n\nThe best employee I\'ve ever hired was a 19 year old woman who had never taken a computer science class in her life.  She came in and didn\'t know how to use the Windows filesystem.  When she quit six months later, I would give her a strange error and she would come back a few hours later and say: "I taught myself how to compile the source code for dependency X because I read an article on Stack Overflow that said that version 5.2 of Y requires X but there is a bug in function Z, so I needed to install a different version and modify one line to get it to work."

I have a story to tell about bitcoins. Unfortunately, I can\'t tell you what bitcoins are and what they do and how they work in just 5 words. Just like grandma can\'t tell why she loves grandpa in just 5 words. I mean, she could ... but it would not be fair to grandpa. Surely he deserves more then 5 words! As so does this story. Buckle up, we are going to talk ... money. \n\n\nBitcoin is a another way of doing what money does. Instead of having paper money and bank accounts bitcoin has the blockchain. This is a very big book  full with names of people and how much bitcoins they have under their name. Let\'s say Alice wants to buy something from Bob that will cost 10 bitcoin. Alice will have to let the bookkeeper know and the bookkeeper will update the book, writing "Alice -10" and "Bob +10".\nOf course it\'s not very convenient to call the bookkeeper every time you want to buy something. But we already do that by getting money from the ATM machine when we want to buy a coffee (or maybe a frappuccino) . The bookkeeper in that story is just a computer that is connected over the internet to a very big computer somewhere at the big bank, where the big book is.  Now there was a wise guy in Japan who thought long and hard about this. And he saw some problems. He saw that the bookkeepers had more power over the money of Alice and Bob then Alice and Bob had themselves. When the bookkeeper says no, it\'s no and there is not much you can do about that!  There is no freedom in that, thought the wise Japanese guy, just a few that have control over many!  Why don\'t we split up this big computer at the bank and instead use Alice and Bob their computers at home? If we make all the computers in the world work together then they can also keep the book, just like the big computer at the bank. And then the big computer at the big bank, and the people that own the big computer and make it do what they say, can\'t decide the faith of the many anymore! But wait ... thought the wise Japanese guy ... what if Bob\'s computer changes the book in his favor and Alice her computer wants  to change the book in her favor? Then we would have two books and the numbers in there would conflict! I wonder, thought the wise Japanese guy ... if I can come up with a system that will make it impossible for anybody to do this ... or if not impossible ... at least so insanely hard that nobody will ever even try it, like making a full size eiffel tower out of balloons and hedgehogs. And that\'s what the wise Japanese guy did. But being a very wise guy ... he wanted to remain anonymous. When you say things that people don\'t like, sometimes they want to come over to your house and shout nasty things at you. But if they don\'t know where your house lives then they can\'t do that! That\'s what it means to be anonymous. And so likewise the wise guy in our story was afraid that the old bookkeepers would not like his invention very much. After all the world would have less use for them, just like these ladies that use to connect you when you called somebody on the phone lost their jobs after machines took over. And so he called himself; John Doe. But he was japanese and John Doe in Japanese is ... Satoshi Nakamoto.\n\nMister Nakamoto worked long and hard, and finally he completed his work: [The Blockchain!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1Y73sPHKxw) \n\nI am going to explain how the blockchain works, but be warned. Although every small part of the blockchain is not so hard to understand, the complete blockchain is very complex. Just like one little gear in a clock is easy to understand, but how do hundreds of these little gears form a working clock? What does that one do? And this one? Which little gear keeps track of time? Well, it\'s all of them. They work together. And so it is with the blockchain, there are many little blocks and they all work together and form a chain. The blockchain. \n\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\nI am stopping right now, because I need to get dressed and look for a job. But I will finish this epic story of cleverness, ingenuity and a bit of sushi or my name is not LibrarianLibertarian!\n\nBecause they said that nobody [could explain what the matrix was](https://xkcd.com/566/). But maybe they just sucked at explaining. So in the spirit of Richard Feynman and by the wise saying of Albert Einstein; if you understand something but can\'t explain it so others can understand it to... well then you don\'t understand it at all! \n\nThis might take a while and many revision and a way to find anologies for very complex math (Public Key Cryptography using clock aritimitsc can be explained by mixing colors like [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QnD2c4Xovk) does.) But it can be done and I will do it! It\'s about time to make a decent ELI5 for the blockchain and the bitcoin ecosystem.

Eventually, you're in for a day of reckoning.": 9, "I'm pretty sure you understand this, being who you are.  For the rest of the audience:\n\nWhen a bank opens up, and takes deposits from people, the customer's statements show how much they are supposed to have in there.  The balance goes up when they deposit paychecks, and goes down when they use a debit card, as expected.\n\nThen the bank makes loans with the depositor's money.  Even though the money has been loaned out, the depositor statements still show the same balance.  A typical bank might loan out 92% of depositor's funds, and hold 8% as reserves.  Instead of the depositor's money, the bank now holds 92% loan assets (loans that other people owe to the bank).  As long as the borrowers pay back the loans with interest, and the depositors don't all try to take out their money at the same time, this can continue.\n\nWhat happens to the money loaned out?  Eventually someone (car dealer, furniture store, etc.) accepts the loan check, and deposits it in *their* bank.  Now the money exists in two places at once, the original depositor's balance at the first bank, and whoever ended up with the loan check's account at the second bank.  Now the second bank loans out 92% of *their* deposit, etc. and the game continues until the original deposit is turned into 12.5 times as many deposits across the banking system, balanced by 1 unit of reserves and 11.5 units of loans.\n\nThis game is possible because banks don't tell you your balance consists of 8% actual money, and 92% loans out there somewhere.  Most people think the balance on their monthly statement is all actual money.  And they can pull out actual money at a teller or ATM, as long as everyone doesn't try to do it at the same time.": 5}}}
