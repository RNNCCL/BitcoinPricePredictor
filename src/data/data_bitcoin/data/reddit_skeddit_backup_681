In such a case the user can't securely use this as a hotwallet because the provider also has that key, and the provider has no incentive to require payments by asking users to send to that address because if funds were *ever* sent to an unidentified address both the user and service provider might be accused of fraud.

A site that can pay for extra connections to the internet will have faster response, anyway.  The USPS offers several services with different speeds at different costs, but it is still neutral because it does not discriminate senders and receivers, as long as they pay the proper tariffs.\n\nNet neutrality is about *the companies that provide your access to the internet and carry the packets you send or receive* should not discriminate according to the *contents or the destination* of the packets.  E.g., a company blocking  all VOIP packets except Skype\'s, or all video straming except Netflix.\n\nIn principle, a neutral net coul have "express packets" and "ordinary packets", and charge differently for each type.  (There is even a bit in the packet header that was reserved for that purpose.)  As long as they offered that option to all customers and content providers, with same prices and service, net neutrality would still be preserved.  But that is not what the telcos want; they want to have control of what customers can and cannot access, to charge monopoly prices for contents, instead of free market prices.  \n\nTL-DR: The Telcos are against net neutrality because it keeps the market of internet services a free market.\n\nEDIT: the "express" bit in the header has never been used, presumably because the telcos cannot guarantee that an "express" packet will travel faster than an ordinary one.  Clients would not like to pay for a privilege that they cannot even tell whether it was granted or not.': 2, 'He mentions USPS "one tariff for all destinations" as an analogy. That is not relevant.  Net neutrality has to do with discrimination by contents of packets, not distance, nor quality of service.  On the internet, discrimination by distance and QoS is impractical because of the complexity of routing, virtual networks, etc. The correct analogy would be: the USPS charges the same postage to send a letter to the same place, with same weight and priority, no matter what is inside it.  \n\nI did not have the patience to listen to that long presentation.

Post scarcity is not possible. \n\nAt best we could try to make everyone equal, but experiments with socialism show that corruption and totalitarianism rapidly invades any system designed to force equality. Furthermore, forced equality correlates strongly with ever declining resources. In some cases it's cased the death of tens of millions by failures of central planning; the great leap forward in China or the Holomodor famine in Ukraine.

The way Marx envisioned it, revolution was not to come from above, by the government but from the people when they understand the merits of it. \n\nThat is something we can try now too, for eg, instead of forced socialism we could have a strong state that leans left, free education and minimum social benefits like food for all, that gives the poor and the downtrodden a fighting chance even if they dont end up as millionaires. Free universal health care like its done in many places in Europe.\n\nInstead of free for all capitalism, regulatory authorities to keep check of things, and make sure they are independent bodies and not under the control of politicians to check corruption.\n\nNow these are all steps towards socialism and they are much better than all out socialism because of the risks that brings along with it. And looking at all the alternatives, its seems best to improve upon socialism than going with capitalism. It's known that Communism is a failed experiment on the world's stage but it was one of the greatest experiments in the history of mankind and what we should be doing is taking notes and moving forward, not holding on to its mistakes.\n\nThat is for both the left and right, the left should be accepting the mistakes of stalinism and to have accomodated stalinism in blind faith and the right should be trying to improve upon it.\n\nAfter all, like Marx said, after a transient socialist state, the state is going to wither away and its going to be a pretty close to a gift economy and that is pretty much what the liberals and the anrachists are fighting for too.\n": 1, 'Any comments about the substance of my argument?': 6, 'Karl Marx is the one who claims a transitional state is necessary, take it up with him.': 4, '> My means are rules that allow voluntary relationships with minimal violence.\n\nThere are two problems with this model:\n\n- **Voluntary:** When there are extreme disparities in resources, calling relationships voluntary is questionable. Someone in poverty can "choose" to work for 10 cents per day, or "choose" to pay $1000/pill for life-saving medication. Where there is no leverage, there is no agency; where there is no agency, there is no will.\n\n- **Minimal violence:** Existing capital and property relationships are maintained via the threat of force. Violence is not eliminated, and instead becomes a tool of the wealthy, applied selectively. (Poor Charlie Shrem sits in prison, while the big bankers faced no consequences.)\n\nThat said, I\'m not going to claim Chomsky\'s solutions are necessarily realistic. However, there is a wider spectrum of potential community and social systems than what we have become accustomed to, and it is this history from which Chomsky draws. I recommend David Graeber\'s [Debt: The First 5,000 Years](http://www.amazon.com/Debt-The-First-000-Years/dp/1612191290) for exploring the history of money and its relationship to war, slavery and the state, and the multitude of primitive currency-less societal systems for managing responsibilities and resources (spoiler: it wasn\'t barter).\n\nWhile I have no illusions about the possibility or desirability of reverting to pre-industrial, small-scale social systems, I don\'t think we should be content with prioritzing the rights of capital as an end unto itself, and I am confident in our ability to create superior and more equitable post-state social structures.': 15, "I don't care about mutualists": 1, 'Except that words do have a fucking meaning and capitalism is defined as an economic system based on private property rights, not as free trade and association.': 4, 'The idea of "free political interaction" between those with guns and those without guns is a sick joke, perhaps worth some moments in Chomsky\'s mind, but nowhere else.': -2, 'Nope, just articles here and there, not his books. \n\nI know what you\'re implying: that he doesn\'t want to use force, that he\'s an "anarcho-syndicalist" or whatever, etc.   \n\nBut that\'s a contradiction.  Let\'s say I have a commune and there\'s no force being used.  But I have a special talent.  Perhaps I\'m Michael Jordan.  So now, people want to see me play basketball.  But I won\'t play unless people voluntarily give up some of their stuff to me.  So even if people give me a very small amount, I\'ll be a rich man because everyone in the commune gives me a small amount.  Now I\'m twice as rich as the next person.  Is that okay in an anarcho-syndicalist commune?  If not, will everyone else claim that I\'m exploiting people and use guns to take my stuff?  \n\nIf so, then there\'s no "anarcho-" at all.\n\nIf not, then it\'s not distinguishable from market anarchism.': -5, "you can't even compare capitalism to socialism as the first is an economic system while the former is a political system. socialist economy is impossible. read human action, ludwig von mises.": -3, 'Communism doesn\'t involve a state it\'s in the damn definition.

But, wait! We can do that now..!': -1, 'I thought he said it had never really been tried- which struck me as ironic because anarchocapitalists say the same thing if a market failure is brought up. ': 1, "Bitcoin isn't really capitalism in a way.\n\nit isn't a privately owned company, part of the definition of capitalism.": 7, '> Most libertarians use the "you started it" rule wrt violence. Whoever starts it is the violent aggressor.\n\nI agree that violently seizing private property is an act of aggression, and at minimum requires a very high bar of justification, no different than a so-called "just war". However, I dispute the notion that defense of private property is never an aggressive act.\n\nFor one example, take intellectual property law. If I remix an artist\'s song, or copy a patented software feature, I have not engaged in a violent act; however, the owner of that intellectual property may then leverage the state\'s monopoly on violence to stop me.\n\n> As far as Shrem, he was helping people take part in voluntary interactions. The state decided this was illegal. They threw him in jail. They are violating property rights, not enforcing them.\n\nBut this is the issue: laws are not applied consistently or universally, due to the coercive pressure of capital itself. (The word *privilege* means "private law".) Whatever might be on the books, in practice, the protections of property rights scales directly, and exponentionally, to how much property one owns (and one\'s ability to afford a lawyer, if not a senator). The state as we know it exists precisely because it is a collusion with the extremely wealthy to maintain their private control of vast resources. The fact that the middle class gains some mild protections for their homes, cars, etc, is merely a pleasant side effect (and as shown by civil asset forfeiture and SLAPP suits, it\'s also revokable at any time).\n\n> We have to start somewhere. If you want to rearrange the current property distribution, you need someone with a big stick to take from some and give to others.\n\nI agree that the "big stick" model of redistribution is impractical, inhumane and destructive. At the same time, unquestioned acceptance of all entrenched property rights carries a deep tax on progress, freedom, and even the market. Here\'s a highly relevant example that is still being fought today: taxi medallions in New York, vs. the market disruption represented by Uber/Lyft/etc.\n\nA medallion currently has a value of about a million dollars, having been traded for years on a secondary market created by an artificial government monopoly. Whether one favors regulation or not, clearly these medallions are artificially scarce and reduce the efficiency of taxi services in New York. However, these medallions also represent the nest egg and/or livelihood of many people; wouldn\'t eliminating such an unjust, counter-productive system also destroy the private property these people purchased in good faith? (Similar conundrums exist with overly broad patent portfolios, public or private decisions that affect property values, etc.)\n\nSo while I don\'t think property rights should be eliminated, I don\'t think we should consider them intrinsically sacrosanct, either. In a perfect world, progressive taxation could be used to re-balance wealth in a gradual, peaceful way; however, given the problems of regulatory capture, cronyism and perverse incentives, there are plenty of reasons to oppose this, at least in our current political climate.\n\nHere\'s one thing that I\'m sure we can do, though, without writing a law, levying a tax, or firing a gun. And that\'s to change the culture of capitalism in our heads. I don\'t mean eliminating markets or profit: I mean eliminating the celebration of greed and selfishness as a virtue. In my perfect world, every entrepreneur would see their business as a socially responsible member of the community, or even as a charity with a sustainable revenue model (which necessarily includes paying one\'s self a living wage). And we would all stop purchasing from corporations (most of which are legally mandated to act as sociopaths), instead voluntarily supporting human-run businesses with solid values, good employee relationships, and honest, transparent practices.\n\nOf course, there are also methods of wealth redistribution that don\'t require the state or violence: boycotts, competetive non-profits, social ostracization, tax protests, voluntary charitable contributions, divestment, collective bargaining, local currencies, alternative communities, and lots more that haven\'t been thought of. But perhaps that\'s a discussion for another day. :)': 2, "So we have exisiting property rights which is a huge problem, and if we are to fuck around with that we'll have to move far from libertarian ideas.\n\nMaybe what we need is a socialist state to equalize the situation a bit and then move towards libertarianism?": -1, 'Not sure where in the book atm, but here is a quote which, I believe, shows his faith in the potential of reformism and working within the current system to change things:\n\n> "It\xe2\x80\x99s better to be able to make your own decisions than to have someone else make decisions and force you to observe them.

In short, he should provide some evidence for the claim.\n\nA lot of things Chomsky believes make sense. A lot of them also don't make sense.\n\n(Not that I'm pro 'consumerism'. It seems like a complex topic.)": -3, "Firstly, I appreciate having a civil and sense-making conversation here. I don't want to go so far as to say that's rare, but perhaps more like I appreciate someone who can talk through the nuances of a situation. Even the people I agree with at any given moment can sometimes be a bit close minded.\n\nI have two difficulties with the plan to move to a socialist state on the path to getting to that charity-based-equality that we both agree is probably ideal. \n1. How do we create a strong government that is benevolent/non-corrupt? It seems like the least corrupt institutions we have are run not by elected officials but by their creators. E.g. Jimmy Whales and wikipedia. That's not a democracy, it's a monarchy that people can walk away from at any moment if they don't like it. By contrast, it seems like every organization that lasts a long time is eventually corrupted as people usurp it's organization. The libertarians will say the answer is to reduce the involvement of government so it can't be corrupt. I find that compelling because I can find no other way to make an honest organization than to let people walk away from it when it stops being so.\n2. I'm not convinced people will be able to make the transition from being compelled to give in a socialist world to voluntary giving in an anarchist world. They would have to be educated and 100% bought in. But while that work is happening, it's once again just as possible that some corrupt elements will usurp the organization. Here again, I suspect the only way to keep a revolution clean is to allow people to walk away from that organization and follow/start another at any moment.\n\nThanks for your time": 1, 'ok, so this time try to read _and_ understand.': -6, "Except crypto-anarchy is a form of anarcho-capitalism, at least that's how the cipher punks in the 90s saw it and how many in the space want it to become.\n\nI have no doubt blockchain tech could be created to enable better and trustless voting systems, but once people have economic freedom and power, they won't want political power disenfranchising them again (like the current system)\n\nBesides, I wouldn't worry about the close ties. Anarcho-Capitalism is a supersystem. One that simply requires everyone have the ability to own resources and require explicit contracts before being made to do something.\n\nIt can still have voluntary socialism and voluntary syndicalism. Just like today's state capitalism has co-ops, communes, and syndicates now.\n\nAncap superstructure versus Statecap superstructure differences only matter in terms of war and debt. As in, Ancaps want the elimination of war and debt. All forms of other oppression should be solved thereafter.

The main voucher seller in BTC China's exchange uses China Merchant's Bank. No other major banks in China are regularly present in the exchange with any/all available amounts for purchase.  \n4) Once the voucher has been selected, you must deposit the amount you elected in the exchange into your China Merchant's account.  \n5) Send the voucher amount (now in your China Merchant's account) to the name and card number on the voucher you purchased.  Again, using China Merchant's bank it will be the same person every time, which is easy.  I have someone at the physical bank help me with the sending of money each time.  \n6) Go into the voucher exchange on BTC China and confirm the money has been sent - the seller of the voucher will then release the funds in to your BTC China account and you can trade as you see fit. \n\nnote: you can also use QQ to communicate with the seller of the voucher (BTC China provides the link to their QQ contact info in the exchange) to expedite the voucher confirmation process.  You can also request they create a unique voucher amount if it isn't available in the exchange already.  \n\nAlipay (China's Paypal) will enable all of the sending and receiving of money to be done online, but you'll still need to deposit your cash, which is why I choose to go the China Merchant's Bank route, since I can do everything while I'm at the bank depositing it.  \n\nIf you have any other questions, PM me and I would love to help you! \n\nAlso, localbitcoins unfortunately has very few sellers here, as I check regularly.  \n\n*I typed this out quickly right before work, sorry if there are any typos*\n\n*also, this entire process is done each and every time for ZERO fees* :-)\n\nedit: typos and additional info": 3, 'You might want to start here in the FAQ, there is lots of helpful stuff http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/2plr21/rbitcoin_faq_newcomers_please_read/': 1, "This thread has been linked to from elsewhere on reddit.\n\n\n - [/r/BetterBitcoin] [American living in china.

As you implied in your fruit example, economic incentives explain pretty much 100% why people do bad things. If there's a big enough economic incentive to screw someone else over, people will do it. Bitcoin is different from the money we've had for thousands of years. It's not violence-based, it's math-based. Before bitcoin, the one thing that you could always trust in this world was that powerful people will do whatever is necessary to maintain their power, which is why we trust the financial system so much. The banks are vampires, but hey, at least they're consistent in their bloodsucking, which makes the system relatively stable. Before bitcoin, this was literally the best there was. And this system incentivizes people to do bad things because it takes all their free time and money, and dishonest, corrupt, and violent behavior is often very profitable. \n\nIn the new bitcoin economy that is coming, this will not be the case. The economic incentives to act dishonestly on the Internet are rapidly dwindling, as it's becoming easier and easier to earn an honest living. As long as you take privacy and security seriously, no one can really acquire your coins without your consent. And personal security is getting better and better every year. \n\nIf everyone is able to make an honest living, this incentivizes people to pull their own weight and produce at least as much as they consume. Necessities like food, water, and shelter won't be scarce once people are able to do this. Once everyone is pulling their own weight, a different side of human nature emerges, as I've witnessed at Burning Man. People that have plenty of resources and time are generous and happy. \n\nAnyway, sorry about the long rant, and I know that this vision of the future may not become reality anytime soon, but it gives me enough hope that I'm fighting to make it real every day.

I can\'t just send the 9.2  BTC note to the sender, he\'d need to give me change.  But Bitcoin has a way to "convert" notes into other notes.  You can combine as many as you\'d like and produce new bills (so long as they add up to what you put in).  So in this case, I\'ll just take the 9.2 BTC note and split it into two parts - 9.04 and .16.  In the process of creating new bills, I actually assign ownership of it to who I want to transfer it to.  This uses the public key of the recipient.  Now, only he can spend it in the future.  The 9.04 bill left, I want to give it back to myself.  So I put my own public key on it so I can keep spending it.\n\nIn your case, you broke the change into two spots.  Why this happened, it\'s not clear.  Something about how blockchain.info split your change decided to do this.

That initial conclusion can generally be tied directly to experiences, influences, and circumstances unique to that person. They then set out to ask other people for their opinion, or do some research in order to inform themselves about the topic. However, it's my opinion that the only thing this last step generally achieves is reinforcing one's original position.

In reality, people generally have opinions that suit their own situation and values. have you ever had a friend or loved one come to you for advice, and you work really hard to give them a sincere and well thought out opinion, only to have them disregard it completely to continue on the path that they would have chosen anyways? Have you ever had a girlfriend ask you which dress you like more, when she knows exactly which one she is going to pick from the start?

Meaning getting consensus on a hard-fork is trivially easy as you barely need any mining power.\n\nOr 2) everyone thinks the only way forward is to reinstitute a mining reward. Miners earn mining rewards, so they'll agree to a hard-fork that increases their rewards. So getting consensus on a hard-fork is easy.\n\nSo there shouldn't be any problem with switching the code (which takes 1 minute). The problem is getting consensus afterwards, but I think the scenarios I showed say there is no issue there.": 1, "> Is it realistic to expect large companies to begin PAYING their employees in Bitcoin? \n\nNot anytime soon. Small companies, yes. If you're paying 8 employees, it's just about free to switch to a different system for payouts. If you've got a corporation with 10k employees, a systems change is an investment that costs tens of millions. Right now bitcoin is unproven, nascent, there is limited demand by employees for bitcoin payouts, and there are few elegant software solutions that have any reputation whatsoever to do it. Too many risks, too few benefits, too big investments.\n\n> What would motivate them to do so?\n\n1) demand from employees. It can one day become a perk just like 'free lunch' or 'insurance coverage, only much easier to do. Companies will do quite a lot to improve their reputation in the job market. Employees would demand it because of immediate payout and because they'd want bitcoin obviously. (who would want that, is a separate question we assume the answer to is 'yes'. If it's not, then this entire discussion is irrelevant anyway.)\n\n2) lower costs, faster payout. ACH is still a system used for payout and it's really slow. It's not that expensive actually, the transaction itself is pretty cheap, but it's expensive in that it can take time and manual labor, and can get especially costly when you let an external company process it for you. With bitcoin you have digital money, so you can build full software solutions. And that means it's cheap and automated. Kind of like processing email versus mail, it's a world of difference.\n\n3) because bitcoin allows some very interesting money management at companies. Things like accounting, as well as assurance, budgeting, security, anti-theft/fraud etc become very easy to do in a system that is 100% transparent (to the company), 100% accountable, 100% digital. Again, software solutions. Things like multi-signature would be a very interesting tool to manage budgets securely, for example. Accounting where money went is easily traced back to the signee etc. You'd be surprised how crappy financial systems are at companies, I think a lot of us can tell a story of how systems were leaky, not properly supervised, accounting was incomprehensive etc.\n\n> When would you expect this to happen if at all?\n\nThere's a few companies in this space right now, they'll pickup in 2015 and do small companies. If they're successful, you'll see e.g. Coinbase build a similar product. (e.g. look at how they build a tipping service within 2 weeks right after the ChangeTip media hype.) Then you'll probably see that roll out and prove itself for 2 years or so and then the big boys roll in, just like how Bitpay started in 2011, proved itself with small retailers, then did multiple billion-dollar companies in 2014. So it'll probably be something like 2016-2018.\n\nIt will probably start really scrappy. e.g. maybe Braintree will allow 5% of its employees who sign up for it get paid in bitcoin, and only the engineers will sign up, and it'll mostly be a manual thing. It'd be an experiment, more to learn and brand the company as being 'innovative, tech-focused, listening to employees' rather than  because it works so much better than the regular payroll software. This could happen within months, it just takes one big company to try it. Wouldn't be surprised if Overstock did it in 2015. But it probably will be more for ideological/branding reasons than because it's actually that awesome.\n\nAnd then after 2020 you'll probably see a fully integrated module for existing ERP systems like Oracle's human resource payroll systems, integrated with e.g. Coinbase.

Why isn't it 10mb? If there were no negative side effects to putting it at 10 mb, then we should just keep it at 10mb. If there's no negative side effect to having NO cap at all (i.e. it can go to 10000000 mb if you wanted to), then we should remove the cap.\n\nBut there is a cap. And it's there for a reason. \n\nSo consider what you're saying. You're saying, if there is demand, the cap should go up. It's a bit silly, because the cap is there to CAP the transactions even if the demand exceeds it. \n\nTo make a dynamic cap completely destroys the idea of a cap. How can you impose a limit, if the limit goes up everytime the demand exceeds the limit? That's literally not a limit anymore, it's nothing, it's just some variable that has zero influence, because it's not limiting anything if the limit is increased everytime you reach it.\n\nIn short, a cap is there for a reason. Unless you can argue that there should be no cap at all, you can't argue that the cap should be dynamic. You could argue that the cap should be increased a bit right now, to that I would agree.\n\nYou could also argue that the cap should be dynamic based on the ability of the network to function properly at a higher cap. (because that's the actual thing that the cap has to ensure: the ability for the network to function properly. That's why we don't have a 100 mb cap, as the network wouldn't handle it properly. If you can detect that the network can handle a higher cap, then you can justify dynamically adjusting the cap based on the network's ability). \n\nBut I've not seen any proposal to actually measure that (the network's ability to handle a higher cap) properly. You'd have to basically measure how cheap and plentiful storage/networks/cpu is, so that in 10 years time when all of that is 100 times cheaper, the cap is dynamically raised by 100x. But again, there's no real way to measure that properly at the moment. So we resort to humans looking at the technological capacity of the network every few years and increasing it manually. So in 5 years when storing a 30gb blockchain costs 1 penny and the standard network speed is 250 mbit/s, we can increase the cap by quite a bit. \n\nOf course there are trends. Moore's law for CPU, Kryders and Nielsen's for storage and network speed. They all average around the 50% a year range. So every 10 years the cap could be raised by a factor of 57 or so. I think it'd be pretty smart to increase the cap by say 30% each year (not 50%, just to be on the safe side), and then manually adjust as necessary. This way you may want to adjust every 5 years, instead of every year.

Whereas there's no known way of gaming a CPU-intensive algorithm, like trying random nonces to find a hash. Proof of work is easy, proof of node is not.\n\nSecondly, proof of work is what secures the system. It creates the incentive to be honest and provides the timestamping system and prevents double-spending. That's crucial. And it's measurable. So that's what is rewarded.\n\nAs it is rewarded, you get competition for it. This increases the difficulty of mining, which increased the cost of mining, which makes cheating and double spending more and more risky (as your investments are large, and double-spending would destroy the value of your mining income), and makes it more and more difficult to control 51% of a very expensive operation. This is what provides a lot of security. Rewarding nodes is not just hard to do because they can't reliably be measured, but it also wouldn't provide the security that proof of work does.\n\nFortunately, running a node is relatively cheap and we have many more than we actually need. Given there are big optimizations coming, like pruning, headers first, invertible bloom filters, and given storage/network/cpu grows at roughly 50% per year (57x per decade), it's not really a big problem (imo) that nodes aren't rewarded. It's not something we can safely ignore completely, as we need quite a lot of nodes, but it's not the biggest problem as running a node appears very doable today, and very doable in the future, and we'll get many more if bitcoin adoption grows.

The code is all there in C++. That's the most popular implementation. \n\nBut it's probably going to be extremely arbitrary. There is no reason that code is particularly unique or well-written or suitable for learning or suitable for education.\n\nFor education, you're much better off with just going through the bitcoin whitepaper and getting a sense of how the protocol works, a general sense of how cryptography works, and a general sense of how decentralizing trust works using proof of work. None of that really requires any code.  \n\nAs for learning to code, I'd just start with basic stuff:\n\n* Scratch on the Raspberry Pi. Very basic stuff, not powerful but very visual and easy to get into. Great place to start exploring general computing skills and an intuition for basic concepts like an algorithm without it sounding esoteric.\n\n* GM: Studio to make games. It's very forgiving, yet quite powerful. e.g. these games were made with it: https://www.yoyogames.com/showcase?page=1\n\n* Google Coder for Raspberry Pi. Great place to start exploring web development and front-end stuff. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH24YwdayFg\n\nThen if he likes that, try some basic C++ and Java stuff. You'll be on track for Bitcoin Core and BitcoinJ soon enough. I'd also recommend sticking with javascript, it's becoming such a dominant language. Everyone browser is committed to it, everyone's optimizing for it, and you now see hugely popular server-side implementations too with things like NodeJS. It's not particularly great for the bitcoin protocol, but a billion things using bitcoin can be built using javascript, like the front-end for wallets, exchanges, tipping, remittance etc. Bitpay's bitcore is great here, and there are a ton of APIs like Chain that you can use with JS.": 1, 'Not sure if this is a moronic question (it probably is in some parts), so here we go:\n\n**How do I secure my bitcoins offline with a backup that doesnt introduce a single point of failure and how do I test my setup without sacrificing its security?**\n\nI have an old laptop I want to use as an offline storage device.

My laptop is encrypted (just to give me time to move the bitcoins in case it gets stolen) and the PC would be worthless (at least for the bitcoins).\n\nSo I looked into lockboxes, Armorys version of multi sig wallets I guess. Im thinking about making a 2 of 3 lockbox. One is my laptop, another one could be my smartphone (like a normal 2FA) and the third.. my normal PC?! But then I still have a problem if someone breaks in and takes laptop and PC (my phone should be with me at all times when Im out of the house).\n\nI also dont know how I would store the paper backups in a way that doesnt introduce more security holes.\n\nAnd the last part is how do I test the setup once its done without losing security? Im not sure if this is true but if I send a test transaction from the offline wallet to another wallet of mine, doesn\'t that give away information about my offline wallet a hacker could use?\n\nI don\'t have many bitcoins, so it\'s probably overkill for now, but who knows.

It\'d be a very good argument for them. Luckily, like everything in cryptocurrency, a solution is available.\n\nThe NFC spec defines something called \'card emulation\', which means an NFC-enabled device, such as many modern phones, may emulate the behavior of an NFC smart card. They can do this while the device is turned off. They can get power from either the battery (which typically has plenty of juice left for simple operations, even when it\'s "*empty*"), or power may be transmitted wirelessly by the terminal you wish to communicate with.\n\nMost phones contain one or multiple \'Secure Elements\', these are hardware components that may be used to store data and applications in a secure way. These are components such as the SIM-card, an external SD-card, or - often - an embedded component in the NFC chip (typically the PN65N chip by NXP, if I\'m not mistaken) and they may be used to store applications that can do an ECDSA signing operations. You can communicate, if you so enable it, with these applications over NFC, through card emulation.\n\nIf you can communicate with them and do signing this way, you can also do payments this way. So even when your phone is off/dead, you could still be able to pay with an NFC-enabled terminal using this method.\n\nNow, these signing operations are, unfortunately, quite complex and they take a long time, so I\'m not sure if these components (which are a super-simple and limited IC) would be able to do this efficiently.\n\n> The other scenario I was in a foreign country and did not have data access on my phone.\n\nAlready there are several wallets that only require one of the two parties to be connected to the internet in order to do payments; you would retrieve a payment request (QR-code, NFC, Bluetooth, whatever), sign a transaction making that payment, transmit the signed transaction to the terminal (over Bluetooth, typically), terminal would broadcast, done.': 2, "You're welcome :)": 1, 'I\'ll help you out a bit by giving you an overview of the process that I have pieced together from a couple of different sources.\n\nFirst, this is fairly time-consuming, but really only happens when I am legitimately moving a lot of bitcoins out of savings and into something else.  Ultimately, I like the setup because I feel like there are multiple redundant protections.  I like to imagine a virus called, "The Perfect Bitcoin Thief" or PBT, for short:  this virus can read all of your files and the clipboard, plus logs all of your keystrokes and will keep them in any available memory until it has an internet connection.  This is probably paranoia, but it helps me think in a worst-case kind of way.\n\nSo, like you, I have armory running a full client on a computer connected to the internet.  On here I have a general-spending wallet which is encrypted.  I don\'t keep many bitcoins in that wallet, it is mostly for a way to move coins on my PC (like, if I am buying a plane ticket from expedia or something).  The other wallet I have is a Watch Only Savings wallet, so I can\'t spend from it on the online machine at all.  This "Savings" wallet is backed up with a 3-of-4 fragmented paper backup.  I have the different fragments stored in distinct places (both within my residence and without), as well as encrypted digital backups I have sent friends/family members in case of some weird total loss.\n\nSo, to spend from my watch-only wallet, I boot an offline machine into TAILS from a USB stick with nothing else on it.  Then I can create an unsigned transaction with the watch only, transfer to the TAILS machine, sign it, and transfer it back to broadcast.  It all ends up looking like this:\n\n1.  Create Unsigned transaction from watch-only wallet.\n\n2.  Boot up TAILS from a live USB stick.\n\n3.  Use another *virgin* USB stick which **never touches a machine that sees the internet** to load the offline bundle of Armory.  You *can* have a wallet file on this USB, too, but I just rebuild it from my paper fragments, as that reduces the risk.\n\n4.  Sign transactions and move the signed transaction file between the TAILS system and the full Armory system.\n\n5.  Broadcast the transaction from the full Armory computer.\n\nSo, how does PBT fair against my setup?\n\n1.  The watch-only wallet with the funds has no private keys on the computer with connection to the internet.  PBT can have this wallet file - it does no good.  \n\n2.  The only system which *ever* sees the fragmented backups (and hence the private keys) is TAILS without an internet connection.  Once I have the wallet, I load up the unsigned transaction, sign it, and eject the USB.  Unless my USB somehow downloads PBT, there\'s no way in.  TAILS wipes itself clean after every shutdown, so there\'s nowhere for the private keys to be stored, either.\n\n3.  When connecting the USB with the signed transaction, do so with the Armory computer unconnected to the internet.  Then you can unload the signed transaction file and disconnect the USB, keeping it cleaner.  Be sure to look over your signed transaction before you broadcast it to make sure things are going where you want them too, just in case.\n\nSo that\'s it!  The main point of failure is (admittedly) the fragmented paper backup.  If someone was to steal three of the four fragments, they could reconstruct my wallet from scratch, and start spending those funds.  But, in a situation where one is in my home safe, one is in a security deposit box at a bank, one is at a family member\'s house, and one is in a file in my file cabinet at work (called something innocuous like "Group B Meeting Minutes, 2004"), I think this is an acceptable amount of risk.  Note:  these are only examples; I didn\'t just tell the internet where my paper backup fragments are!\n\nIf you wanted to make this a little more secure, you could run the 2-of-3 Lockbox into the same kind of system - only signing transactions on an offline TAILS machine.  I think you can do that, anyway.  Not sure.  I hope that helps.  I have been struggling with finding a system that makes me feel at ease, and I think this one is my favorite so far.

You could store a private key on paper, on a usb stick, on a debit card. Hell you could transport a transaction by pigeon if you wanted, or via radio, or via morse code.\n\nSo yeah I think the phone-dying scenario will be solved. \n\n> but are there any other outstanding efforts being made to solve these problems?\n\nI think it's too soon to expect full solutions, when less than 0.1% of businesses even accept bitcoin, it's more about getting that to 5% rather than making sure that 0.1% can pay at every possible opportunity. So I don't think anyone is working specifically on the problem of being able to pay without a phone battery. But just to list a few things that exist: 1) Trezor, a hardware device that lets you sign transactions. 2) Bitcoin debit card, a few companies do this like Xapo. Its connected to your bitcoin wallet, and you can just use it to pay just about anywhere. McDonalds, Walmart, Starbucks etc. 3) Extra phone batteries :p 4) Bitcoin paper wallets, for if someone else has a phone, or if the terminal can swipe a QR code with a private key for example.\n\nHell tech is getting so cheap and small, you can probably buy a mini chip loaded with a private key for 1c in bulk. It'd be about the same size as a tooth. Its battery would last years, and you could load it with $10 and just hold it infront of the terminal and it'd do an NFC payment automatically. And then you'd just dispose it. That's literally a possible solution to phone batteries that you could create in the next few years.  It'd basically be like having money coins like today, only digitally on cheap chips. Not saying it'll happen, it's very wasteful and not very eco-friendly, just saying there are a ton of possible solutions because all you need is 1 kilobyte of storage for a private key and an algorithm, and a tiny chip that barely has any computing power (i.e. your phone has 10.000x the computing power), to store a private key and sign a transaction. Basically no different from your debitcard, and the payment terminal does any of the 'heavy' lifting (which is not heavy at all either but relatively speaking). \n\n": 3}, ('Convinced a guy with a shop and cafe in Leeds to accept Bitcoin.

The fact is, whatever a person wants to spend their money on can look stupid to someone else. The whole point of this is that a person should be allowed to spend their money how they like instead of having condescending assholes telling them how they\'re supposed to live their life.\n\nI\'ve spent money on weed and poker.

They may have various negative side effects, particularly in the long run. But what happens if you don't have to worry about any side-effects, say, thirty years from now? Oh, that's right: you can tolerate more risk!\n\nYes, financially it becomes more complicated. But, for the fourth or fifth time, we are *not* talking about the money that financially sustains a person. We're talking about extra money which a person could be wasting regardless of their age. Now, what happens if a 20-year-old wastes some spare money? They have pretty good odds of at some point in the rest of their life needing some money.\n\nConversely, what happens if a 81-year-old who has paid off her home, has a guaranteed income stream, relatively fixed expenses, and overlapping health insurance wastes some spare money? Oh, that's right: nothing.\n\nYes, of course, the younger person can and should theoretically invest in higher-risk assets as they have a longer timeframe for their investing while the older person should be invested in more conservative assets like bonds as they do not have time to recoup losses.

Do we all expect economy to grind to a halt because all the companies will just buy gold instead of investing money? They could expect gold to constantly gain a higher rpice, because there is a limited supply. Do companies tend to not invest in IT infrastructure, because they can expect it to be by far outdated a couple of years in the future, and they could buy greater faster cooler equipment with the same money in the future? Of course investments will have to compete with a potentially growing price of bitcoin. But is there anything specific which leads you to think the price will constantly grow in a rate outpacing potential earnings of other investments? If there was any certainty about a price grow, people would instantly buy, and within a short period of time the current price level would reflect the expected future value.': 3, 'There are 2 types of inflation. Price inflation and money supply inflation.  Most people think about price inflation.  When prices are increasing, people who have money stuffed in mattresses might be cajoled into pulling it out and spending it into the economy (either on goods, equities or interest paying bank deposits).  Nowadays interest rates have been hammered so low people are looking for yields in higher risk areas, which can lead to malinvestment.  \n\nIn actual fact, with 25 freshly minted coins being produced every block, bitcoin has experienced about 11% money supply inflation this year and price inflation has been even worse.': 1, 'Basically, people tend to say that a non-inflating currency will keep people from buying stuff, because their money will be worth more in the future, so they will keep it.

First, the possibility to buy two bananas in a year from the money I need to buy one now will not keep me from eating. Likewise, the possibility to buy a sportscar when I am too old to drive will not keep me from buying a smaller car now. Then, again, saving for later is not a bad thing in the first place, a lot of big troubles and state scale problems today came into existence because people were spending too much, not because they were carefully thinking about the expenses. There are also (to my knowledge) no long term data and experiments about deflationary currencies, because it just never happened over a long period of time before, so its basically a lot of speculation. All in all, its a good thing to take a look from different angles and listen to concerns, but I personally am not worried.

Critics say that\xe2\x80\x99s proof digital currency has failed.\n\nIgnore them. Bitcoin\xe2\x80\x99s price is irrelevant to the key question of whether the underlying technology will disrupt finance.  There are many signs it will.\n\nBitcoin is much more than just a currency. Investors from Silicon Valley to Wall Street are now pouring money and expertise into what they view as an adaptable technology platform. Software developers anywhere can use bitcoin\xe2\x80\x99s open-source code to create specialized applications that let businesses undertake commercial exchanges without using middlemen. These applications threaten to make redundant many services provided by banks, foreign-exchange houses, escrow agents, clearing houses, notaries public and even lawyers.\n\nOf course, none of that guarantees that bitcoin will succeed. Detractors will rightly argue that householders won\xe2\x80\x99t save or transact in a unit of exchange whose value fluctuates wildly. Indeed, while bitcoin transactions continue to rise, and even though a growing list of merchants accepting bitcoin now includes Microsoft, Expedia EXPE +0.31% and Dish Network DISH +0.30%, digital currency\xe2\x80\x99s portion of global commerce remains minuscule.\n\nBut it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter that mom and pop aren\xe2\x80\x99t comfortable with bitcoin. What matters is whether the exploding software innovation around cryptocurrency leads to solutions that allow corporations and governments to derive benefits while protecting themselves from risks, including the volatility. The vision that many in Silicon Valley have is that bitcoin, or perhaps some clone of it, will work in the background of the global economy. Mom and pop won\xe2\x80\x99t even know it\xe2\x80\x99s there.\n\nBalaji Srinivasan, a partner at venture-capital firm Andreessen Horowitz in Menlo Park, Calif., likens bitcoin\xe2\x80\x99s current status to the early days of Linux, whose open-source operating system initially sought to compete with Microsoft\xe2\x80\x99s Windows on personal computers but eventually became the leading operating system for enterprise servers. Much like some bitcoin evangelists\xe2\x80\x99 views of fiat currencies, early Linux supporters \xe2\x80\x9cwere overconfidently saying, \xe2\x80\x98We are going to kill Microsoft,\xe2\x80\x99 and yet while it never got a much of a presence on desktops, it did gain a presence on the server side,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Srinivasan said. \xe2\x80\x9cNow, 15 years later, the Internet as we know it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t exist without Linux.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nMr. Srinivasan talks of how a \xe2\x80\x9cdual boot\xe2\x80\x9d of Linux and Windows became popular as techies simultaneously tapped the best functions of both. It\xe2\x80\x99s analogous, he says, to how cryptocurrency developers are making their applications \xe2\x80\x9cinteroperable\xe2\x80\x9d with traditional monetary systems. Bitcoin, with its more efficient, direct and cheaper system of exchange, would support payments and transfers over the Internet and then connect seamlessly with the offline economy, where the dollar and other traditional currencies continued to reign.\n\nMr. Srinivasan\xe2\x80\x99s firm, which was co-founded by Netscape pioneer Marc Andreessen, is one of dozens that have invested a total $311 million in bitcoin startups this year, according to a tally by news site Coindesk. That\xe2\x80\x99s up from $93 million in 2013. The names behind these deals read like a who\xe2\x80\x99s who of Internet history: Tim Draper of the Valley\xe2\x80\x99s legendary Draper family, Reid Hoffman of LinkedIn fame, Yahoo YHOO -0.06% founder Jerry Yang and many others.\n\nWhat gets these people excited is bitcoin\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cdecentralized\xe2\x80\x9d infrastructure: the public, distributed ledger known as the blockchain, which is updated and maintained in real time by a network of independent computers to generate an ongoing consensus on the voracity of its data.\n\nThese computers are known as miners. While the new bitcoins they earn in return for maintaining the blockchain ledger can be metaphorically likened to freshly mined gold, the miners\xe2\x80\x99 real work is to authenticate information. This vital role allows people and businesses that have no other way to trust each other to engage in commerce without the expensive intermediation of a third-party institution. It\xe2\x80\x99s the first case of \xe2\x80\x9cdecentralized trust\xe2\x80\x9d to challenge the hub-and-spokes \xe2\x80\x9ccentralized\xe2\x80\x9d structure of international finance that was forged during the Renaissance by Florence\xe2\x80\x99s Medici family.\n\nBitcoin\xe2\x80\x99s fast, low-cost system for authenticating information not only makes it possible to make payments without fees going to credit card companies, banks, payment processors or exchange houses, but also to decentralize many other economic functions. Since any information can be embedded into the blockchain ledger and because the core software is an open platform, startups are building myriad \xe2\x80\x9cBitcoin 2.0\xe2\x80\x9d applications based on the same principle: blockchain-based ride-sharing services, personal ID systems, database management and asset registries, even the wild idea of companies run not by human managers but by software programs.\n\nWall Street is in on the act, too. Senior investment bank managers are joining bitcoin startups. Hedge funds are trading digital currencies. Ex-traders are building high-tech platforms and derivatives to better manage digital currency\xe2\x80\x99s volatility. Bitcoin\xe2\x80\x99s price is now quoted on Bloomberg terminals. Some banks are using Ripple Labs\xe2\x80\x99 cryptocurrency network for international transfers. Some Federal Reserve district banks are looking at how the technology might streamline the Fed\xe2\x80\x99s interbank payments system.\n\nMeanwhile, the British, Mexican and other governments are studying blockchain solutions to enhance economic transparency.\n\nExcessive government regulation could also strangle cryptocurrency, of course. But smart regulation could legitimize it. Last week, New York Superintendent of Financial Services Benjamin Lawsky unveiled details for a revised \xe2\x80\x9cBitLicense\xe2\x80\x9d that was welcomed by many in the bitcoin community for promoting innovation.\n\nThese are the developments that matter, not the roller coaster of bitcoin\xe2\x80\x99s price.\n\n\xe2\x80\x93 Follow Michael J.
