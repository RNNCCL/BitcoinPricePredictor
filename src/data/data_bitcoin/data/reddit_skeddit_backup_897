And definitely not mobile. A local sms carrier for bitcoin is needed here.": 6, "This is good news!\n\n Right now bitpesa accepts bitcoin and then sends money [to a system called M-Pesa](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M-Pesa). I imagine that if Bitpesa and bitcoin prove successful, Kenyans (and other countries that use M-pesa) will eventually start cutting out M-Pesa (and Bitpesa) and simply using bitcoin for their transactions.\n\nThat would be awesome but it would mean the end of bitpesa acting as a middleman (I'm sure they'll find some other niche.)\n\nDoes anybody know if Bitpesa is already planning to expand to other countries? ": 7, "We're not competing with M-Pesa though. In fact, they're our mechanism of payout. Also, their fee structure is a scaled flat rate, not a percentage and it's completely different for bulk payments.": 6, 'Yes, depositing EUR/USD through a bank to a Bitcoin exchange, then sending that to a Bitcoin remittance service like BitPesa is not very easy yet. Also the deposit takes a few days, while WU accepts CC so it is instant (BitPesa does send the money after a few minutes btw.)\n\nActually according to some researches many foreign workers are not doing remittance through the internet at all, but through physical (WU) agents ^(()^[source](http://www.consumersinternational.org/media/886482/the%20remittances%20game%20of%20chance.pdf) ^(- but probably outdated/incomplete research)^)\n\nBut Bitcoin remittance is just starting.\n\nWhat if.. Bitcoin ATMs can somehow connect to remittance services and people can just put in cash in the country they work in, and easily send it to their families which receive it in minutes ^([1]) Sure, they both might not really use Bitcoin themselves, but it would just the underlying technology for a cheaper way of sending money. Sounds cool to me!\n\n^(1. Currently this would be possible if you have a QR of the deposit address from the remittance service I guess - but still not "that" easy.

[See here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/2eliox/two_months_after_we_launched_rebit_were_busting/ck0vgb7).\n\nSince I really like the concept of remittance with Bitcoin, but I do like fair comparisons, I will **compare Bitpesa with WesternUnion and WorldRemit** ("traditional remittance services".)\n\nFirst of all Bitpesa is using the same "marketing techniques" as any other remittance service, saying they don\'t have transfer fees but charging 3% exchange rate fees. Anyway I am not interested in fees or percentages, I want to know how much KES I get out of ... EUR. Also "even" WU does not offer a "to bank" option to Kenya (not like to the Philippines.)\n\n**WesternUnion**\n\n- For 1000 EUR ^((975+25)^) I get 110287.59 KES (110.29)\n\n- For 300 EUR ^((285+15)^) I get 32237.91 KES (107.46)\n\n- For 100 EUR ^((93+7)^) I get 10519,74 KES (105.20)\n\n- For 20 EUR ^((18+2)^) I get 2036.08 KES (101.80)\n\n**WorldRemit**\n\n- For 1000 EUR ^((978+22)^) I get 110608 KES (110.61)\n\n- For 300 EUR ^((290+10)^) I get 32798 KES (109.33)\n\n- For 100 EUR ^((95+5)^) I get 10744 KES (107.44)\n\n- For 20 EUR ^((18+2)^) I get 2036 KES (101.80)\n\nSo WorldRemit is a bit cheaper than WesternUnion.\n\n**BitPesa**\n\n***Kraken***\n\nFor 1000 EUR I get (1000/361.77081\\*(1-0.0035)) = 2.75450636827 BTC.\n\n***BitStamp***\n\nFor 1000 EUR I get [1309.20 USD](https://www.bitstamp.net/api/eur_usd/) so (500/474.87\\*(1-0.005)+500/474.87\\*(1-0.0048)+309.2/474.87\\*(1-0.0046)) = 2.74365127298 BTC (bit odd calculation because of fee levels.)\n\nSo, even though they just raised their fees, Kraken is cheaper at this moment therefor I will use Kraken. I can use this amount of 1000 EUR because there is the same percentage fee on buying the Bitcoin. So 10 EUR will be the same as 1000 EUR (however for simplicity I just use "last trade price" and assume I can buy 1000 EUR on that price.)\n\n- (2.75450636827\\*40900) = 112659.310462 KES / 1000 EUR (112.66)\n\nSo basically I get 112.66 KES for every EUR.\n\n**So..** With BitPesa you **112.66 KES**/EUR. With WorldRemit you get **101.80 KES**/EUR (10% less) for small amounts and **110.61 KES**/EUR (2% less) for big amounts.\n\n**Is that all?** No. BitPesa sends it to your mobile phone (M-Pesa, Orange, Airtel, or Yu) These providers still charge a fee if you want to withdraw that money. WorldRemit has the option to send it also to M-Pesa, but they can also send it to their [partners](https://www.worldremit.com/send/ViewLocations.aspx?id=94) (fees unknown unfortunately - but might be free.) WesternUnion sends it also to 1 of their agents and states "they may charge an extra fee".\n\nAnyway let\'s see how much you get from BitPesa in the end. [Here are the M-Pesa W/D fees](http://www.hapakenya.com/new-mpesa-charges/) EDIT: I used ATM withdrawal fees, probably the cheaper "agent fees" are used though):\n\n- (20/361.77081\\*(1-0.0035))\\*40900 = (2253-33) = 2220 (111)\n\n- (100/361.77081\\*(1-0.0035))\\*40900 = (11265.93-193) = 11072 (110.72) - 11K is just above the "10K fee level"\n\n- (300/361.77081\\*(1-0.0035))\\*40900 = (33797-193-193) = 33411 (111.37)\n\n- (1000/361.77081\\*(1-0.0035))\\*40900 = (112659-193-193-193-193-193-193) = 111501 (111.50)\n\n^((They have a max fee of 193 for max 20K w/d so you will need 6 w/ds for that last one.)^)\n\nSo even if WorldRemit has no extra fee at 1 of their partners, BitPesa is still cheaper!\n\n**TL;DR BitPesa really seems always between 1-2% till 10% cheaper than 2 of the "traditional remittance services".**\n\n^(Note 1: I use EUR because I use EUR :p Be free to compare the same with USD.)\n\n^(Note 2: If I made any calculation mistake PLEASE correct me.

I\'m referring to that a version 1 address encodes a script pubkey template in base58 (OP_DUP OP_HASH160 <data> OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_CHECKSIG).\n\nThere is no such thing as a "version 1 address." See this [list of common address versions and prefixes](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/List_of_address_prefixes). Most Bitcoin addresses in common use are version 0, and they do not encode any script at all. Version 0 addresses encode (in Base58Check) the RIPEMD-160 hash of the SHA-256 hash of the public key, which is an EC point. The public key can be encoded in compressed point format or uncompressed point format prior to hashing.\n\n> There is no hashing involved in the conversion of a scriptPubKey to an address\xe2\x80\x94 except that used for the 32-bit check value.\n\nAs stated above, the public key is hashed using SHA-256 and then RIPEMD-160, and that final digest is encoded in Base58Check to form a version-0 address (a.k.a. a "pay-to-pubkey-hash" address).\n\nThe other kind of commonly used address (though orders of magnitude less commonly used than version 0) is the version-5 address (a.k.a. a "pay-to-script-hash" address). That type of address consists of the Base58Check encoding of the RIPEMD-160 hash of the SHA-256 hash of a script fragment to be prepended to the scriptSig in a transaction input.\n\n> Bitcoin does not use ECDSA directly. It uses a special and unique to Bitcoin, hybrid digital signature cryptosystem (which happens to embed ECDSA). Script is an attribute-based digital signature system where some parts are zero-knowledge (the parts behind ECDSA) and some parts are not.\n\nScript is a stack-based virtual machine language. I would not call it a cryptosystem. Some of its opcodes do perform cryptographic operations. Other opcodes perform integer calculations or control the flow of execution.\n\nNewer Intel CPUs contain AES-NI instructions, but no one would call the x64 instruction set "a cryptosystem that happens to embed AES."\n\n> A pubkey key in bitcoin is not an elliptic curve point. A pubkey key in Bitcoin is a scriptPubKey and may not involve elliptic curve DSA at all.\n\nYou have it backwards. A scriptPubKey is a script that may, but is not required to, include a public key. In the early days of Bitcoin, scriptPubKey did typically contain a public key. Those outputs were of the "pay-to-pubkey" type. The common output type in use today is of the "pay-to-pubkey-**hash**" type. The scriptPubKey of this type of output does not contain a public key but does contain the hash of a public key. "scriptPubKey" is really a misnomer, and I prefer to call it simply an "output script." Likewise, "scriptSig" is a misnomer, and I prefer to call it simply an "input script."\n\n> if you have only the point alone you do not have the required information to produce a scriptPubKey which the recipients software will reliably notice and be able to spend.\n\nIf you give me a point on the secp256k1 curve, I can give you a scriptPubKey that will be noticed by any Bitcoin software which has the corresponding private key in its wallet.': 0, "That's the Base58Check encoding, and it's 25 *characters*, which may or may not be 25 *bytes* (depending on what character encoding you're using).

You're kidding, right? A hash function _by itself_ is not the an asymmetric cipher, but you absolutely can construct an asymmetric signature system out of nothing but hashes.

Mainly because people want physical currency in useful denominations.  Sure I can buy a minted BTC for $1000, but that dosn't help me pay for a $1.99 coffee and donut with cash.  Without this, anyone without a smartphone is unable to access or use money in any form.\n\nNow this could be worked around with Trezor type devices, small portable wallets.  Perhaps something akin to the PlasCard from the Tekwar SciFi series- a tiny gadget that can hold any amount of currency, and can easily send it to another such device, but is cheap enough that you can own many.

More likely though would be some kind of payment card, but again this only works in a society that's willing to give up cash.\n\n-----\n\nAs for value effects- the value would go way up, because now BTC is actually recognized by a government as official currency.  That government can demand that foreign governments treat their currency without special bias, which could undo many of the bad regulation and tax proposals currently under consideration (IE BitLicense).\n\nFor the country's economy, it would be affected in the same was as any other country that adopts a foreign currency.

Payment protocol like BIP0070 would have to be used everywhere most likely.
