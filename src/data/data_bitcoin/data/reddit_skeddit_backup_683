The price if bitcoin would rise at least temporarily, but this increase in price would be offset by the velocity of the currency.\n\nWill Walmart dive in? Maybe. But you certainly shouldn\'t look at us as a leader on this issue. As much as I would personally like the company to say "what the heck"  and jump in, that is probably not a priority for our shareholders. If we were a startup tech company, our shareholders would probably more supportive of a "what the heck" gambit.\n\nThe "optionally paying our employees with bitcoin" is a good idea, and I\'ll ask our compensation team about what that would look like. **I love bitcoin, but I wouldn\'t accept my salary in that currency. Sure, I could buy stuff from Walmart, but I couldn\'t pay my mortgage with it.** This is that critical mass problem you mentioned.\n\nI\'m sure that whenever Walmart does get into bitcoin (it\'s just a matter of time, in my opinion), there will be significant excitement for the company that will be partners in it.\n': 4, 'Yes!  Have 1000 bits /u/changetip': 8, 'Throw away account here.\n\nI am a senior associate in Walmart corporate finance and big time supporter of Bitcoin. I literally just had this "when are we going to accept bitcoin" conversation with our Treasury team. The Walmart technology division is filled with techie people that are all interested in Bitcoin and ready to develop the POS bitcoin acceptance systems.\n\nSomeone else in this thread hit the nail on the head: who is Walmart\'s customer? Well, she (yes, we consider our average customer a female and refer to her that way) is middle income, and in no way is technically inclined. Let\'s be honest, as of right now, most people don\'t understand bitcoin (what\'s the block chain? How do I keep my coins safe? Etc.) Walmart\'s customer isn\'t familiar enough with bitcoin to make it worth Walmart\'s time to accept this form of payment. \n\nAnd then the Treasury team has to figure out what to do with those coins. We can\'t pay wages with them, and our major partners don\'t accept them as payment. What do we do with them? We\'d have to convert them back to cash to settle our debts. So the idea that WMT can offer a discount to bitcoin customers is ridiculous.\n\nAs much as I love bitcoin, and as much as it\'s technically feasible (like I said, ISD is filled with technologists that love bitcoin and are ready to program our POS to accept it), there is no benefit to Walmart to take it on right now. \n\nSorry.

We had a similar discussion about accepting Bitcoin, however our result was a little bit on the other side of the spectrum: we\'re hoping integrating bitcoin will target millennials, but we\'re unsure if the business case is strong enough to warrant the "risk" (risk is really just fear of the unknown, but it\'s labelled risk regardless). Even if accepting Bitcoins aren\'t given the green light, I think it\'s fantastic that the conversation is even being had: big business knows Bitcoin exists and sees it almost as viable (or at least comparable) to accepting Amazon Pay*, or Apple Pay*, or Google Wallet*, or PayPal*, etc... It\'s just a function of time at this point, so when people hear bitcoin they aren\'t afraid. That is when it will hit the market.\n\n\\* Note: I know there is a HUGE difference between Bitcoin and these payment processors, but to business, it\'s just a way to receive money; they don\'t care whether its a currency, or if it\'s p2p , or anything: in the end it\'s just a means for them to be paid.': 40, "I wonder if Caesar's Legion will start accepting Bitcoin as well...": 7, 'That\'s a good question.

For example, I am forbidden by corporate policy from accepting any gift from any supplier. If I am at a supplier's office and they buy a bottled water from the vending machine, I cannot accept it. I must reimburse them the cost or buy one myself. I cannot accept gift baskets during holiday season. This is because the cost of those gifts will ultimately get baked into the costs of the products we are providing to our customers, which goes against our mission.\n\nThe only way that transacting in bitcoin is useful is if *both parties* value bitcoin.

The devastation seen in wounds from some of the first examples of the 5.56x45 mm ( 55 grain m193 round ) were considered to be 'inhumane'. They would yaw on impact with the target and cause hydrostatic shock beyond what the US military was seeking. For this very reason they opted to field the Belgian developed 62 grain SS109 round. The reason being the US military had a specific requirement that the round penetrate one side of a steel helmet at 600 meter range. The design of the round SS109 itself is much less capable of fragmentation than the M193 and therefore considered more humane. The effect of fragmentation on impact has a lot more to do with velocity than it does with anything else like weight or kinetic 'energy'. \n\nThe article you used as a reference cites the SAS and their specific opinion of the round but fails to mention they are using this round almost exclusively in short barrel CQB style weapons like the M4 or the SA80. Shorter barrels provide significantly lower velocity than a long barrel with which this round was designed for. Therefore it would make sense for the SAS to convert to a larger round with more weight and lower velocity since they are essentially a covert operations and rapid deployment force and mostly prefer carbine rifles or even SMG's to full size battle rifles or long barrel assault rifles.

I think I\'m still confused on the notion of \'pegging\' when the sidechain isn\'t another currency.\n\n>It\'s essentially a way of preserving the ownership of Bitcoins such that you can verify the coins that have been contributed to a sidechain, this allows coins produced in the sidechain to prove that they are tied to the coins in the Bitcoin blockchain. This way if a user wants to essentially unpeg sidechain coins they own because the sidechain failed, or maybe they just want their bitcoins back for whatever reason, the user can use the information stored in the sidechain coin to still move the correct number of coins in the Bitcoin network that were dedicated to the sidechain.\n> \n> Colored coins is a very loose, quasi-sidechain example, bitcoins can be selectively "colored" or marked with extra information to represent something else, such as a stock, but it still retains all the information needed to still use it as a bitcoin. If the stock fails for that colored coin, or the holder wants to abandon the stock and use the bitcoin instead, the "stocks" that the user received as fractions of a bitcoin can be spent as a normal bitcoin without any problem. This will affect the total number of stocks on record (as it can no longer be used as a stock anymore), but the spendability of the bitcoin that was essentially used to peg the stocks to remains unharmed.\n> \n> Now colored coins is not a sidechain, but it does share some of it\'s qualities and provides very tantalising and exciting insights into what sidechains could accomplish. Colored coins still use the blockchain though to conduct all transactions, wheras a sidechain would use it\'s own blockchain to store transactions, thus reducing transaction bloat, and would enable sidechains to completely redesign the structure of the blockchain for their own particular needs. As long as it retained enough information for the bitcoins that were assigned to the chain to be spent, so that both blockchains were able to recognise the spend when the bitcoin enters or leaves the sidechain, then they can create massively different sidechains for all manner of purposes, and the risk for these sidechains, as well as the people that dedicate bitcoins to these alts could be massively reduced.\n> \n> Hopefully that makes it a little clearer.\n\n\n': 2}, ('Found a solution to the block size problem.', 1): {'This is a CD that is claimed to have a theoretical capacity of 100000 Petabytes though.
