And we can't expect miners to sell their mined BTCs at a loss because that would be economic insanity.\n\nFor me it follows that miners don't care about the long term potential of BTC but are rather in it for the quick buck. Otherwise they would sell less and hold more which they could because, as shown above, mining is still profitable. Even if some miners dump a lot to force prices down, to drive miners that hodl out of the market, they'll do themselves a disservice because they are reducing overall hashing power and thereby the utility and value of the Bitcoin infrastructure.\n\nSo yes, miners are somewhat subverting the system.

Obviously the Yuan bankers would have an unfair advantage. Bitcoin itself would benefit greatly from a lot of the services provided by the financial services industry, and it seems weird that the government would treat it different than other currency.\n\nThe caveats woud be that Bitcoin is much more secure than other currencies (re: the double spending problem) and traceable because of the block chain, and that might justify relaxing anti-money laundering rules for example.\n\nThis cuts the other way, however, as--depending on the Bitcoin financial service provider\'s business model--a simple hack into a customer\'s "online banking" portal or scan of their "cash" (paper wallet) and an irreversible theft is easy.

All the dropping price says is that in the last few months there\'ve been a lot more people wanting to sell BTC than buy it. This happens in other currencies as well, and significantly so in smaller-country currencies when speculation is one of the biggest driving factors. The advantage BTC has over those small-nation-currencies is that it can\'t be printed into oblivion, and it\'s merchant acceptance (particularly online merchant acceptance) is growing in spite of volatility. That wouldn\'t be the case with a small nation currency, which would see it\'s vendors start demanding dollars or euros.\n\nWhat bitcoin needs, is financial instruments attached to it. This is how all currencies work. The more desirable financial investment instruments that are attached to a currency, the more money/value gets thrown into that denomination, and the stronger the currency gets. Right now, the biggest upward pressure on BTC/USD price are speculation (which is highly volatile), and essentially U.S. preppers and unbanked, which don\'t have big money. Interestingly enough, the USD has been strengthening lately, which makes speculators and survival-minded people less likely to buy BTC.
