Because if taking some good by force from its previous is not sufficient to ground an ownership claim, then by Misesian-style \xe2\x80\x9cregression\xe2\x80\x9d it becomes obvious that only the first possessor/user can have an ownership claim. Every other person takes it from a previous possessor, and is thus a mere possessor\xe2\x80\x93not an owner. The first possessor\xe2\x80\x93the person who plucks the resource from its unowned state out of the commons\xe2\x80\x93is the only possessor who does not take it from someone else; this is why first possession imbues the homesteader with the unique status of ownership.\n>\n> The first user and possessor of a good is either its owner or he is not. If he is not, then who is? The person who takes it from him by force? **If forcefully taking possession from a prior owner entitles the new possessor to the thing, then there is no such thing as ownership, but only mere possession.** But such a rule -- that a later user may acquire something by taking it from the previous owner -- does not avoid conflicts, it rather authorizes them. \n\n[Source](http://archive.mises.org/6992/thoughts-on-the-latecomer-and-homesteading-ideas-or-why-the-very-idea-of-ownership-implies-that-only-libertarian-principles-are-justifiable/)\n\nFrom this logic, it follows that not all hierarchical relationships are a violation of one\'s rights.

You basically want to *avoid* spending anything on additional hardware, because there\'s a very good chance you\'ll never earn your expenses back. I think the best way to do this is still to go the scrypt route and mine through CleverMining. You might want to check my estimate on this, as the price of altcoins relative to Bitcoin has dropped a lot since I was doing this six months or more ago. Another factor is scrypt ASICs are now entering the scene raising the difficulty quickly as they did with Bitcoin\'s SHA256 algorithm. Check to see what old and/or idle computers and, most importantly, what newer generation AMD/ATI video cards you have lying around. Nvidia video cards work as well, but are not as efficient. Using your free power, set them all up doing combination CPU and GPU mining of scrypt to CleverMining. This will almost certainly generate some tiny income, and you will not have spent anything on additional hardware. Keep in mind that most stock computers cannot tolerate this heat/power supply load for long, so you may need to open the cases and set up external fans. If you live in a warm climate, the only added cost to you may be higher A/C use. If you live in a cold area, you\'re getting free heat!  \n\nIf 2), you\'d need to recognize this will be a hobby that will most likely *cost* you money rather than earn it. However, the costs can be very small, at least initially. To support the Bitcoin network, you must mine the SHA256 algorithm on the Bitcoin block chain. You can also *try* CPU and GPU mining SHA256, but I strongly suspect you might accumulate Bitcoin dust too slowly to ever reach a mining pool\'s payout limit. The ASIC you linked in your OP from Amazon *would* work for this purpose, but the Block Erupter is an early generation ASIC that is not efficient by modern standards. I\'d also recommend you check for any hardware you want to buy on eBay also, as used Block Erupters are going for about $5 USD right now. If you want to spend the $1,000+ on current hardware, you\'ll want the most efficient, modern ASIC you can be *sure* to get your hands on. Beware that most ASIC companies are dodgy and you should assume they will scam you rather than deliver on time. Bitmain is probably the most reputable manufacturer right now, and even here it\'s best to avoid pre-orders and purchase stock-on-hand. Used Bitmain Antminer S3\'s are going for between $250 and $320 USD on eBay right now. S4\'s are between $1,350 and $2,000 USD. These generally require one or more separate, high-power ATX power supplies which are often $100+ each.  \n\nIf 3), again, this will likely be a hobby that costs money. You\'d need to acquire hardware that most efficiently mines the algorithm of the crypto-currency you\'re looking to support. Some of these do not have ASICs yet. For these, one or more AMD Radeon R9 290x video cards are probably the best bet. Otherwise, if you choose to mine a scrypt-based altcoin, there are already ASICs, but I don\'t know what the most efficent and cost effective currently are. I know [Grid Seed](http://gridseedasic.com/) has several, some of which you can buy from retailers that have stock on hand. Grid Seeds may require non-PC power supplies. Again, eBay is another source.  \n\nIf 4), you\'ll probably want to minimize your expenses. Again this is unlikely to make a profit. I\'d start with the best low-cost to high mining efficiency ratio you can get. The Block Erupters are low cost, but not very efficient. On the other side is the USB Bitfury Hex-Fury at 11 GH/s. These are quite expensive, and I haven\'t seen any available on eBay at all, but they may be the most efficient USB ASIC avaialble. If you can get a good buy on some USB Bifury Red Fury\'s, this might be a reasonable compromise. You could set any of these up in a powered USB hub connected to a rPi and have some fun. Keep in mind, you don\'t *need* microcomputers like rPi\'s to drive mining rigs, general PCs work fine. Large mining operations try to minimize costs over dozens or hundreds of rigs, so rPi\'s or the equivalent make more sense for them. For hobbyist miners, idle desktops or laptops do fine unless you already have rPi\'s or the equivalent. And if scrypt mining, full computers can contribute a bit via CPU mining whereas microcomputers typically can\'t contribute hashing power.  \n\nTo get started in general, I\'d make use of the [BitcoinTalk forums](https://bitcointalk.org/). They generally list all the announce pages of crypto-currencies, as well as a lot of mining resources. Some keywords that you can search for to get you started include "cpuminer", "cgminer", "cudaminer", "rpc miner", and "cgwatcher". The included documentation text files and READMEs are very helpful.  \n\nEDIT: Forgot to mention that the Block Erupter manufacturer, ASICMiner, is also considered fairly reputable. I\'d still recommend avoiding pre-orders if possible.': 1, 'Right so, say I had free electricity (water turbine) and about $1000 USD to spend. Would it be worth trying to do a few rPi rigs to see what sort of profit is possible?\n\nBasically, interested in microcomputing and mining and I have a power source that should suffice. Any input?': 1, "First thing, it's next to impossible to make money mining on a small scale right now. To even try, you'd need free/super cheap electricity, about $1,000 USD to invest, and a place that can provide 24/7 cooling and tolerate fan noise. Anything less and you are guaranteed to lose money.  \n\nThat said, if you still want to mine as a hobby or for whatever other reason acknowledging that you will be paying for the privilege, know that to mine Bitcoin directly you will need software/hardware that mines the SHA256 hashing algorithm. The Block Erupter you linked to at Amazon is old and obsolete, and is available used at eBay for $5 or $6 USD, but it does mine SHA256.  \n\nCleverMining, on the other hand, is a mining pool for software/hardware mining the Scrypt hashing alogrithm. You can still do this (again likely not profitably) using high-powered GPUs and the right software, or the cheapest ASIC hardware for Scrypt mining that I'm aware of is the [Gridseed](http://gridseedasic.com/). In this case, you're really not directly mining Bitcoin, but you're mining a Scrypt-based altcoin like Litecoin or Dogecoin.

Long term holders may simply still be holding..that wouldn\'t show up in the Unique addresses per day data.\n\nI\'m also beginning to attempt to control active addresses a bit better.  Right now this mainly involves removing dust addresses.  So far the % of active dust addresses as a percent of total active addresses has remained relatively constant...but monitoring this ratio should prevent some forms of manipulation in the active address data point going forward.  I\'m also maintaining a database of point in time snap shots buckets of active addresses (ie, how many active addresses with balance between 1-10....balance between 10-100, 100-1000, 100+, etc etc).  again, the hope is that this will allow us to spot obvious attempts at manipulating this number.\n\nMy database also tracks coinbase users, blockchain.info users, subscribers to r/bitcoin, and bitcointalk.org users.

Better Business Bureau\n\n2. State Attorney General\n\nMarkets like eBay provide a real service.

Can I open the debate a little then?\n\nDo you really think the courts would be unable to understand Bitcoin to the extent they could not deal with claims for breach of contract? I think you are underestimating them.\n\nIt'd be nice to see someone who actually is in a position to make meaningful comments justifying what always looks like a knee jerk judgement. There are a lot of posts around here about how nobody in Wall Street is smart enough to understand it, and that's why they're not all over it, and it's obviously bullshit. \n\nIt also occurs to me that writing an interpreting is fine, but enforcing I think is a bigger problem. Your example is 5 bitcoins, so about $2k. How often does a $2k claim actually get to a court?\n\nI realise this could just as easily apply to a $2 million claim, but the fact is your audience here seem to be doing $100 transactions. Is it really practical to say they can chase each other through the courts for those kind of sums? What are the alternatives for small claims.\n\nI think your reference to incorporating a definition is pretty good, by the way. \n\nAssuming there isn't already one around, and incorporating one from Wikipedia is risky (it can be changed by anyone, so you can't rely on it ever being 'static'), can I sincerely suggest in the course of your research you might come up with one yourself?\n\nAnother thing I wonder about, might interest you - trading sites etc (call themselves exchanges), always seems to me their terms of service are at best evasive. I have only ever seen a couple of jurisdiction clauses, one of which was Germany, the other was Bulgaria. What do you think about people entrusting their wealth to a site like that? I've said on more than one occasion I wouldn't touch it with a bargepole.": 2, 'You asked a number of good questions, and I will try to address them, but not all in one reply.\n\nIn my blog post, I did not say a court could not understand Bitcoin. I said that a court could understand (relatively easily) that a contract for Bitcoin payment is enforceable. The court could understand that a breach of contract had occurred and that a remedy was in order. \n\nHowever, I said it would be hard for the court to conclude that the *remedy* for breach of the contract should be denominated in bitcoin (even though the contract itself was denominated in bitcoin). \n\nI argue the court will say the remedy is a "money judgment." And in the US a money judgment is denominated in United States greenback dollars. The court would say Betty must give John value equal to $2500 . . . not 5BTC. (Then I go on to explain why the court denominates its judgment in dollars rather than bitcoin . . . arguing that, for a court, supervising "specific performance" of a bitcoin transaction is hard.)': 2, 'Not an armchair lawyer.

I am thinking about publishing more suggestions for what to say in contracts for bitcoin . . . and other things that use a distributed ledger (a.k.a. blockchain).\n\n... On the topic of terms of service of exchanges, wallets and other service providers: Obviously risk abounds. So far, the only service provider\xe2\x80\x99s terms of service I have read with any care are Coinbase\xe2\x80\x99s. From the words of Coinbase\xe2\x80\x99s contract, it\xe2\x80\x99s hard for me to tell what Coinbase is doing or is responsible for. Coinbase\xe2\x80\x99s contract attempts dramatically to constrain Coinbase\xe2\x80\x99s liability.\n\nHowever, something lurks in the background to help hold Coinbase\xe2\x80\x99s feet to the fire. Coinbase appears to be headquartered in California. If Coinbase were engaged in fraud (e.g., stealing customers\xe2\x80\x99 bitcoin) then the law of fraud (US/California) could be used against Coinbase and its officers, more or less regardless of what the terms of service say. The law of fraud can be powerful to protect the interests of customers.\n\n[My public comments are NOT legal advice. They are just casual conversation. Use them at your own risk.
