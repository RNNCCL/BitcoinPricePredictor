Just download and launch an application and you can participate in global trade. I view that as useful to more than just people selling contraband.\n\n#"OpenBazaar is Not Decentralized"\n\nJoshua has [repeatedly](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/40xhg3/drop_zone_releases_first_browser_ready_library/cyy7j1r) [claimed](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/40xhg3/drop_zone_releases_first_browser_ready_library/cyy7q73) [that](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3w9xec/just_think_we_deserve_an_explanation_of_how_craig/cxxkyye) OpenBazaar is not decentralized, despite me pointing out his error constantly.\n\nOpenBazaar is a decentralized, peer to peer network. There is no central authority that controls the network. Amazon and eBay and pretty much all online markets have a central authority; OpenBazaar doesn\'t. I\'ll quote myself from an [earlier post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/40xhg3/drop_zone_releases_first_browser_ready_library/cyyawgi) to clearly define what decentralized means.\n\n> >In such a decentralized system, there is no single centralized authority that makes decisions on behalf of all the parties.\n> \n> There is no single centralized authority that makes decisions on OpenBazaar.\n> \n> >Instead each party, also called a peer, makes local autonomous decisions towards its individual goals which may possibly conflict with those of other peers. Peers directly interact with each other and share information or provide service to other peers.\n> \n> OpenBazaar is composed of peers which makes their own decisions, who directly interact with others and share information or provide services to other peers.\n> \n> >An open decentralized system is one in which the entry of peers is not regulated. Any peer can enter or leave the system at any time. \n> \n> Entry of peers is not regulation on OpenBazaar and any peer can enter or leave the system at any time.\n> \n> I could go one but it\'s pretty clear that according to any reasonable definition the OpenBazaar network is decentralized. Your persistence in repeating this "OB isn\'t decentralized" claim shows you are intentionally misleading people. \n\n#"OpenBazaar is just a worse version of HTTP"\n\nAs I said in [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3zv6sc/sneak_peek_at_bitcoins_upcoming_killer_app_open/cypk5sq):\n\n> Our system uses the Ricardian contract model to create contracts that are electronically signed by all parties involved. Everything you need to continue the trade, or settle a dispute, is included in the contract, and because it\'s signed it\'s an immutable record of trade.\n> \n> HTTP doesn\'t do this.\n> \n> Also, there will be services to interact with the network via HTTP, just like there are services to interact with the blockchain via HTTP.\n\nAnd [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/40xhg3/drop_zone_releases_first_browser_ready_library/cyy93im):\n\n> You realize that you also can\'t access the blockchain directly from your browser either?\n> So a blockchain based market like Drop Zone and a p2p market like OpenBazaar both need a third party service to view the markets directly via HTTP.\n> \n> Only difference is that with a p2p market you can access them directly by running the client, whereas you would need to download the entire blockchain to view them directly with a blockchain based market?\n> \n> It\'s a ridiculous criticism.\n\n#"OpenBazaar is trivially censorable"\n\nThey think the best approach for building a marketplace is to put all the data into the blockchain because it makes it highly censorship-resistant, and they place a strong emphasis on that. \n\nBut there are all kinds of drawbacks to doing that, and we choose a different architecture. We take an approach much more similar to the Bittorrent network. It doesn\'t use a blockchain for hosting data, but instead it hosts the data on individual nodes. Each user on the network hosts its own content. This means that if the store goes down, other users cannot reach it (like a node on any other peer to peer network). We have talked about making store data redundant, and might try to use something like IPFS so that other stores can cache data in the future.\n\nCensorship cannot be done at the network level. There\'s no "marketplace administrator" that can take down stores like on centralized marketplaces, whether clearnet like eBay or Darknet like Silk Road. There\'s also no ability to censor a store based on the DNS system. Censorship would need to be someone else going to each person\'s home and unplugging their computers.\n\nSince most people are engaging in commerce that puts them at no threat of having someone bust down their door and shut down their computer, this isn\'t such a huge problem. Besides; what\'s the point of having that information duplicate somewhere else if you\'re unable to operate your store since you\'re in jail? \n\nUsers who do care about privacy can already run OpenBazaar behind a VPN they trust. This would prevent others from seeing your IP and then the ability to censor becomes way more difficult.\n\nIf the only person who can really censor you is a nation-state level actor - and they can only censor you by physically shutting down your computer - then I consider that censorship-resistant.\n\n#"OpenBazaar is just a Shitty Shopify / Magneto / web-hosted store"\n\nI hear this one a lot but it\'s [silly](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3rriui/openbazaar_will_be_live_before_the_end_of_2015/cwqpfxw).\n\n> Shopify requires a monthly fee ranging from $9-$179.\n> \n> OpenBazaar is free to use.\n> \n> Shopify charges 2.4% of each sale plus $0.30 for each credit card transaction.\n> \n> OpenBazaar has no transaction fees.\n> \n> Shopify requires integration into an existing webpage, meaning a user must be paying for a domain and web hosting and must be able to configure their site to use Shopify.\n> \n> OpenBazaar requires no web hosting and no manual configuration of anything, just download and install.\n> \n> Shopify is not a network of users.\n> \n> OpenBazaar is a community of people who can engage in trade directly with each other anywhere in the world using only their computers, the OpenBazaar software, and Bitcoin.\n> OpenBazaar isn\'t a panacea, nor will the first version be perfect. Skepticism is warranted, but simply labeling it a shitty version of an existing product isn\'t accurate or fair. Wait until it\'s released and had time for adoption - at the very least - before passing judgement.\n\nThere\'s two huge differences that they ignore. \n\n1) It\'s not at all simple to go through the process of buying a domain and hosting, then setting up the site and integrating Magneto or whatever. OpenBazaar is free, and it\'s just download and run the file, that\'s it. Super easy.\n\n2) OpenBazaar instantly connects you to everyone else using it - buyers and sellers.

But this is the nature of a tragedy of the commons, that all benefit from a common resource, including those directly responsible for maintaining it. But if this is done exclusively by volunteers it is all too easy to conclude that 'sombody else' can volunteer. \n\n>Mining will ultimately tend toward a few major players. In the end, maybe just a handful of entities will mine everything.\n\nI am just as lost about what to do about this. \n\n>Raising the blocksize helps out each individual bitcoin user (by making transactions cheaper) at the expense of the health of the entire system.\n\nAs long as the cost for operating a node stays in reach of a fair subset of users then, fine. But for scaling to become truly massive then I agree we will have to solve the problem of the division of labor between miners and network operators and how they are compensated. \n\nBut I do not think that any fixed share can fairly represent this division. Because, well, things change. Rather, I expect that it would be more fair to allow a market to develop for network connections. It would require that miners have an incentive to connect to as many nodes as feasible, and not just to each other in order to propagate blocks, and to discover as many new transactions fast as possible. It also requires that the the operation of nodes be verifiable in a manner that defies spoofing so that connections paid for are actually delivering. I doubt that this can be something that is really on the development radar until more pressing issues are resolved. But I hope it is looked at seriously before it becomes a crisis. ": 1, ">Regarding your potential solution: that likely won't work, because it's relatively easy to set up fake nodes that are virtually indistinguishable from real ones.\n\nDoesn't this problem have to be solved anyway for M2M transactions to become a reality? Let's say you have a autonomous router or a server which pays its own Rackspace account out of its own wallet funded by customers who pay this autonomous device for its service... Why could we not do the same with Bitcoin network nodes? Pioneer it in fact.": 1, "You know it's really easy to spin up tons of addresses with small amounts of coin?\n\nYou are just giving a reward to proof of ownership of coins.": 4, "There is actually an incentive to run a node... Security against certain kinds of attack where your business is surrounded by dishonest nodes. \n\nIt's not going to sway everyone, but larger targets will want to take every precaution.": 9, ">it's difficult to incentivize the right thing\n\nIncentivize verifiable bandwidth. This is no different that solving problems for M2M transactions for any autonomous service. The smart contracts can even be structured on a market basis depending on criteria like demand, latency, and up-time. The more difficult thing, I think, would be to properly incentivize the miners to drive the demand, to give them a reason to demand bandwidth in the form of discovering new transactions and propagating their blocks, and not just between each other.

My concerns with any of these services (Bitwage/Bitpay/Wagepoint/Coinsimple), though, no matter how well they are designed, is that they are services.  Even in the case of Coinsimple, which technically isn\'t holding / controlling the user\'s funds, you have to sign up with them to use Coinsimple and you leave information (user information, password, and other related information) on file with them by way of using said service that can be extrapolated over the wire or that can be requested directly from the third party service provider due to warrantless financial surveillance [that was authorized as part of the USA/EEUU cromnibus around one year ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/2rkt1u/coinbase_give_us_the_right_to_run_your_credit/cnh1y9l).  It is true that in some areas, like California, we have recently had success at having [state legislation passed to stop warrantless surveillance](https://bitcoinonair.wordpress.com/2015/10/09/sb-178-calecpa-protecting-californians-against-warrantless-surveillance-of-their-digital-information-signed-into-law-following-defeat-of-ab-1326-cas-anti-virtual-currency-bill-2/).  However, there are always malicious entities (be they individuals, corporations or corporation-states) that operate with blatant disregard for any legal process and so really we have to do the best we can to use technology for financial privacy and anonymity, and not expect that law will do the trick.  Having your information be something that is actually proposed to be only communicated beween you and the party that you need to transact with (no middleman) is a big part of what (decentralized) virtual currency use is about.  Technically speaking, for individuals, the choice is always there as to whether or not they wish to consent to practices of taxation, capital gains, etc., but until relatively recently, the notion of this "choice" has been very difficult to exercise.  It is, arguably, becoming more realistic now.  In fact I do think it is correct to say that [the unregulated SystemD is already the global superpower](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/2n6l03/shadow_economy_no_its_the_real_economy_from_1990s/), which will soon be 2/3rds of the world economy, and will not need to wait until 2020 to become so.': 1, "I will look more into BitSquare.\n\nSince services like BitWage can handle the payroll processing, it makes a flexible choice as a payroll processor, like any service.

It is very likely that we will have to wait for the emergence of a truly decentralized exchange which can function on any platform (Linux variants, Windows, Mac/OSX) before decentralized payroll services will emerge.  However, if we look at Bitsquare - https://bitsquare.io/ - which is doing well at following its roadmap - https://bitsquare.io/roadmap/ - we see there is an example of such a decentralized exchange, albeit in alpha (beta is due out in early 2016).  The current release, v0.3.2.2, is a pre-release candidate (intended mainly for developers and testers) for the official Beta version which will later be released.\n\n\n\nI think that many people, just as you do, find solutions such as Bitwage to be quite reasonable for the present time.  Employers find such solutions convenient because (centralized) solutions such as Bitwage handle all the complexities of compliance issues related to prevailing wages, what needs to be paid, and so on... a good overview of that (at least for USA employer purposes) is here: http://www.laborandemploymentlawcounsel.com/2014/05/bitcoin-101-how-to-pay-your-employees-in-digital-currency/  This is not to say that I agree with the perspective of government intervention in affairs of virtual currency (because actually, I don't), but I do understand where employers want to limit their liability.": 1, "At this point in time, there are no decentralized exchanges, so there probably won't be any payroll services yet.\n\nI use Bitwage and have been quite happy with them, as my employer just sees another bank routing/account number and my bitcoin are deposited directly to an address in my cold storage wallet.
