Problem is, each miner will know that all other miners are doing the same.  For any miner to fork, they would have to be confident that the majority of others *will* also decide to fork.  Same goes for speculators I'd have thought - the same calculation.  If I was a miner I can imagine thinking that inertia alone will mean at least some won't.  And I'd know others would know that.  Absent compulsion it is hard to see how independently acting miners would choose to fork - even though they may all agree a fork is desirable.\n\nI assume compulsion is not possible.  So that leaves co-ordination by communication.  I suppose the 2 or 3 biggest could do it by prior agreement.  Is that possible?  Quite ironic that we might need mining to be fairly centralized!\n\n(Also, if the above is right, it would mean that introducing speculators would make things much worse, as they would not be directly involved in the decision to fork.)\n\nOne more question: does moving to 20Mb blocks necessarily require a *hard* fork?\n": 1}, ('Being broke is expensive with fiat money ;)', 16): {}, ("Use your Bitcoins (and many other cryptocurrencies) to withdraw cash in ATM's, send money through wire transfers or Paypal, buy anything online, pay your bills and recharge phone credit in Mexico!", 46): {'Hi, we do require proof of identity before we send the money and if the service becomes popular enough we could implement additional means of security.': 1, 'Sweet!': 1, 'So in practice *anybody* in the world can put money into *any* Mexican bank account?': 1, 'Hi,\n\nJust a little update.

It\'s worth mentioning, because it\'s so often glossed over, that things like Lucky 13, BEAST etc. , while important breaks, were not actually used to hack real world websites anyway; they\'re part of a class of what are called "padding oracle attacks", which afair originate from Bleichenbacher\'s idea, sometimes crudely called the "million message attack" - it\'s fundamentally dependent on being able to ping a server a ridiculous amount of times. \n\nPoint? That the theoretical breaks are not always practically relevant. Meanwhile the really horrible problems like Heartbleed are coding errors, but imo the real issue is the huge Byzantine mess of supporting a wide range of cipher suites and extensions in TLS (Heartbleed is in DTLS). And the third class - Logjam for example - are a direct consequence of government weakening; but again, it was weakening of the TLS protocol, not the underlying primitives, and again it comes out of the "let\'s dump everything possible into this protocol to satisfy everyone".\n\nA little appreciated feature of Bitcoin, imo, is exactly how simple the crypto is. Almost all the complexity is in Bitcoin Script, and it\'s notable that Satoshi deliberately disabled almost all the interesting OP codes out of paranoia.\n\nBtw this is why I really want sidechains to happen.

The problem is that this new coin will not be fungible -- it will have its own price.

Many do this now (e.g., "we accept Bitcoin, Litecoin, Dogecoin," -- so this shouldn\'t be anything radical. \n\nThe biggest hassle (because no software solving the poblem has been written yet) will be for the wallets to support using the private key for spending on both sides.

Users cannot force miners to mine bigger blocks.  Users can reject big blocks, though.": 1, "> upgrading is a necessary requirement for any > 1MB blocks to occur.\n\nIt's trivial to modify the protocol of v0.11 to reject any additional pre-v0.11 blocks.   So here's one approach that might work.  In v0.11 it checks that once there is at least one valid block that is larger than 1MB then that is like a reset point and from there the only blocks that are valid are those that extend off that larger than 1MB block.  \n\nThat way even though pre-v0.11 chain of 1MB or less blocks might have more than 50% of the hashing capacity, v0.11 won't acknowledge those as being valid.     And it wouldn't take 50% to get the first large block solved either.  With just 1% of the hashing capacity using v0.11 you'ld still could get one block in under one day.": 1, 'Correct.  But the majority of miners upgrading is a necessary requirement for any > 1MB blocks to occur.\n\nThe upcoming civil war will be a very interesting time.

(Or, simply mining off of Bitcoin Core v0.11 then after the first large block comes, revert to pre-v0.11.)": 2, 'The protocol rule is that the chain with the greatest work wins.  But with a hard fork, there are two incompatible protocols.    Which one is right?  \n\nRight now the approach for hardforks is two [protocols] will enter but only one will survive.    The thought that we might have the two sides persist side-by-side is something that just isn\'t thought of as a viable outcome.\n\nPerhaps if we think of that scenario as something normal then improving the protocol becomes easier.\n\nEssentially, the hard fork is simply a new coin that has an initial distribution/premine where every Bitcoin UTXO that exists right before the fork gets a UTXO for the same amount in the new coin.\n\nSure, that really messes up the works.  Firstly, fungibility disappears because you have coins that are 1.) untainted (i.e., Bitcoins that never have been in a transactions that includes a coin mined after the fork), 2.) coins tainted with inputs from coins mined on the side where the 1MB blocksize is still enforced, and 3.) coins tainted with inputs from coins mined on the side where the larger blocksize is accepted.\n\nRight now the miners are having to make a guess as to which side to support.  Thus they are forced to speculate (by taking the risk of mining on the losing side).  It would be much better if speculators were the ones taking the risk.  If speculators see value in larger blocksizes, then they can buy mining contracts for hashing that is targeted to mine with Bitcoin Core v0.11 (which will allow larger blocks).  Others can continue using pre-v0.11 (i.e., v0.10.x and earlier) and both sides can persist.  [They can persist if the v0.11 side is the one with the "most work", yet the pre-v0.11 side still gets sufficient hashing to have at least a couple blocks per hour and at the same time will reject the other chain as invalid due to one or more invalid (larger) blocks.]\n\nIsn\'t that an approach that makes more sense?  If there are contested features then let the market decide if the end result should be a yes (fork wins), no (original chain wins), or the other possible outcome -- both sides get enough hashing to persist indefinitely.': 1, "Heartily agree. \n\nIf we could avoid hard forks forever that would be one thing, but we can't.

Having read the original and then yours Greg, there's a world of difference. ": 1, 'There are two ways of explaining this.\n\nBitcoin has sequence number fields for each coin a transaction is spending.  The idea was that the highest sequence number should dominate and miners should prefer it over lower sequence numbers.  This was never really implemented, and the half implemented code seemed to be making this assumption that miners would honestly prefer the higher sequence numbers, even if the lower ones were much much more profitable.  Thats a pretty dangerous assumption, and so most technical people have assumed that kind of sequence number mediated replacement was useless, because there was no way to enforce "honest" behavior, and even a few rational (profit maximizing) miners would break that completely.\n\nThis change provides the missing piece that makes sequence numbers do something without assuming honesty on the part of miners.  What it does is makes it so the maximum sequence number (the current norm) can be included in any block, like normal. A sequence number of one less than the maximum can only be included in the _next_ block after the input its spending, rather than it being possible to be included in the same block. A sequence number one less than that can only be included two blocks later, and so on.  Counting down from the maximum makes sense, since nothing can be higher than the maximum and no transaction can be in a block before its parent transactions.\n\nThis means that a higher sequence number can always be included earlier than a lower one (even if the time the original coins being spent was unknown when the tx was authored).  Because of this, even rational miners should go along with the scheme: Take the higher sequence number and collect the fees, or skip over it in the hopes that no one else takes a higher number before the next available lower number becomes spendable. And, of course, users are not constrained to make their sequence numbers go down only one at a time.  So it\'s "take the most updated version, now, or gamble that no one in the next dozen blocks takes the most updated AND that you manage to include the next to most when it finally becomes mineable".\n\nThis is similar to how locktime works. In fact, this scheme is _precisely_ relative locktime; and the particular application of it for replacement is what lightning wants a relative locktime for. So thats the other way of explaining it "it\'s relative locktime, signaled using the sequence number field."  But explaining it this latter way leaves you wondering "wtf, why the sequence number field!" (other than the fact that it otherwise does basically nothing), when really it makes a lot of sense to implement it that way.\n': 12, 'Seems to solve quite a number of problems in one fell swoop.': 1, 'This is a suggestion to change the miner rules such that they must obey sequence numbers for transaction replacement.

The problem with an incompatible change (resulting in the hard fork) is a change to the protocol rule and now you can have two chains, each thinking it has the chain of valid blocks with the greatest amount of work.\n\nThe two sides can persist.  Let\'s say miners using Bitcoin Core v0.11 (which allows blocks larger than 1MB) have 60% of all hashing capacity and mine a block larger than 1MB.  They will see their side (which includes that larger block) as being the chain with the greatest amount of work.  Those mining on v0.10.x and earlier (which still enforces the 1MB limit) will reject the blocks on that other chain after the fork because the larger block is not seen as being valid.   So even with just 40% of the mining capacity they could still mine blocks albeit it would be at a slower pace since difficulty is still at the target when here was 100% of the capacity on one chain.\n\nSo, who is the ultimate decider?  The market.  If the market wants coins mined with v0.11, it will have to pay enough for them to be mined.  If the market wants coins mined on the pre-v0.11 side (where the 1MB limit is enforced) then the same thing applies -- it will have to pay enough for those coins so that miners continue mining it.\n\nThere is a very lucrative opportunity if the hard fork results in the two sides persisting.   Therefore, those wanting that outcome to happen simply subsidize the mining costs for whichever is the "losing side" so that two sides will persist.': 1, "They're invested in the Bitcoin economy even if they don't hold BTC or, in the case of pool operators, don't even own BTC-earning machines.": 1}, ('What services or products are lacking in the bitcoin world?', 1): {'Integrating bitcoin into my website.

While they will still accept any mined block up to 20mb from other miners this means that the average block size will still be far lower than 20mb.
