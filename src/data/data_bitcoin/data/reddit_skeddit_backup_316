The debate about miner cost having to be related to the value of the network.\n\nThis is exactly the reason why I worked on and supported the launch of Dogeparty last year.  Turns out the attempt was a) early for the need and b) understaffed for implementation and maintenance but this thought that drove us to get it out there was exactly this.\n\nRight now with the Tokenly project we basically don't support sales cheaper than 30 cents because anything below that has more than 10% going to miner fees, which we perceive to be the upper limit of acceptable cost.  ": 1, "Yep, you simply can't have a tokenized ecosystem built on Counterparty+Bitcoin if there can only be a max 1-2000 transactions processed per block and each one costs $10 or $20 in transaction fees. As a co-founder of Tokenly, I fully admit to this being part of my motivation for wanting larger blocks.. Otherwise we would be forced to move operations to a different blockchain if we want to continue with our dreams of tokenizing the web and redefining monetization on the internet. Bitcoin is where this needs to be.": 1, 'Bitcoin derives its value from the blockchain. If you cripple how much can be put on the blockchain and the number of people who can use it, you ultimately hurt the value of it.\n\nI demand one universal publicly accessible ledger. *That* is why I care about Bitcoin. That is why we must allow for bigger blocks.\n\nThe Doomsayers worrying about 8MB blocks absolutely cannot see the big picture. They fret over centralization yet fail to realize centralization has been occurring and will continue to occur regardless. So just give me my bigger blocks already so we can move on.': 4, 'I don\'t see why it shouldn\'t all be on the bitcoin blockchain. Bitcoin has the highest security and the most users, using anything else naturally means less security and a smaller user base. As long as transaction fees stay reasonably low (like 10 cents or less), then BTC will almost always make the most sense. \n\nAlso you can have lots of tokens registered on the blockchain, but you don\'t necessarily have to have them causing boat loads of transactions. For instance the concept of "Token Controlled Access" uses no transactions, only signed messages, so you can do all kinds of stuff just by simply holding the token in a wallet. Things like payment channels can also be implemented': 1, 'This comment made my day, you might also be interested in this blog post on token controlled access to replace software DRM https://letstalkbitcoin.com/blog/post/tokens-software-and-the-coming-drm-revolution\n': 6, 'lol - during my commute this morning I was totally like I gotta grab that quote this evening/ when I get home and put it on Reddit... and there you go.  ': 3, 'Thanks! Feel free to email adam@tokenly.com': 1, 'I agree it\'d be nice to keep blockchain fees in the range of bank bill payments, so a couple cents.\n\nThere\'s a problem though: anything stored on the blockchain is paid for by all blockchain users. And many don\'t want to store much more than bitcoins there. So some compromise will happen. Presumably by making the market forces play out.\n\nTo connect back to the always-present debate, the block size will increase, and higher tx capability will increase usage, raising tx fees over time. No idea what tx fees are "the best" for longer term. But to keep miners interested and the blockchain safe, sum of fees per mined block must go up soon.': 1, "A few minutes in and this has very critical implications on the block size debate. I used to be staunchly in favor of the Blockstream approach, but this has me seriously questioning everything.\n\nDue to how frequently ebooks, audiobooks and digital content get updated with error corrections and additional goodies, it seems like folly to embed an ebook in its entirety on the blockchain. Hence Adam's approach where a blockchain token grants access to the ebook is the only logical thing to do.\n\nImportantly, it seems very useful for receipts of ebook sales to be given in the form of a blockchain token because *that token* opens up a limitless number of opportunities post-purchase for both customers and authors.\n\nFor example, if you buy tokenized ebooks from a certain set of authors, you can prove to anyone else after the fact that you supported an author financially for say $20 on August 19, 2015 - which happened to be launch day. Then someone *completely unrelated* could grant you access to a membership website based on your launch day support- even decades later. This person could be ANYONE, or even a MACHINE. Android apps or iPhones could reserve special wallpapers or in-game perks for select individuals based on their support of content authors.\n\nIn fact, the purchase history itself could have market value, hence making the tokens transferrable is a really good idea.\n\nAdam's approach works for musicians, artists, *software developers* and content producers of ALL KINDS - so I'm very excited about Tokenly.\n\nIt's regretable that Amazon.com and Audible.com have an effective monopoly on this type of information of who owns what ebook from which author, and who financially supports which author in which amount and on what date. It would be *just plain better* for humanity to record fiscally supported authorship on a global ledger. That's just so much more useful than the status quo where you have Amazon.com on the one hand where the information is monopolized behind a walled garden and then siphoned by the NSA, and torrent trackers on the other where there is a tearing down of all that useful information linking people to their patronage.\n\nPeople should get access to private media torrents based on tokens. It won't end piracy, but you could set it up so that only owners of the real, authentic tokens get premium access to the digital material on launch day, so you'd be the first in line to get the latest and greatest.\n\nIn addition, you bought the content from the real author on launch day, which is an indicator that you're the type of person who deserves VIP treatment by the author, or celebrity access etc.\n\nIt's also critical for this information to be stored on *THE* universal ledger: the Bitcoin blockchain. But it won't be possible to do that if miners fees are too high. It could easily turn out that the real tragedy of the commons isn't with Bitcoin full nodes or miners - but with our resulting destructions of the communal grounds upon which artists and authors market and sell digital content.\n\nBottom line, if it costs $15 to submit a Bitcoin transaction, a $50 app becomes a $65 app, which is horrible. A $15 ebook becoming a $30 ebook due to Bitcoin miners fees is just plain unacceptable. Sure, you can do micropayments on Lightning, but you can't sell $0.99 ebooks! Where do those authors go, then aside from other blockchains? They'd have *no choice*.\n\nIt would be absolutely shameful to cede this use case to alternate ledgers, and I sincerely doubt sidechains are the solution here because you want all the purchase and resale of token histories to be linearly preserved, you want them to be easily transferrable and storable.": 18, "Different issuers of fiat have different counterparty risks.  That's why USD.snapswap may not trade at parity with USD.bitstamp (although in practice, they are very close to 1:1).

This drives up the difficulty to the point where it is only marginally profitable for the average miner to mine. That's why a $2000 piece of mining hardware should be expected to return somewhere close to $2000 or less of bitcoin when factoring in electricity costs. If there was a $2000 mining machine on the market which was expected to yield $10,000 of bitcoin, they would sell like crazy until the difficulty went high enough to bring the yield back down to break-even. You can verify this by reaearchig the cost of miners and see that they tend to operate close to break-even point.\n\nSo for an attacker wants to 51% the bitcoin network today, they need to match the hash power of the whole network. Assuming the attacker has access to the same or similar technology and energy costs, then the cost of attack will roughly match the amount or total investment from the honest miners.\n\nSo in the scenario where there is only $2.50 per block of rewards on offer, no profit-seeking miner would spend thousands of dollars on hashing power because they would be making a loss.

Right now the only priority rule is "Connections from Tor exit nodes have less priority than connections from other IP addresses".\n3. The set of tor exit nodes is public. There\'s a script that fetches them and populates a hardcoded list that\'s compiled into the software.\n4.

All open source systems are like that.": -1, 'Nah not jailbroken': 1, 'Maybe the hacker email bfx using your email account to disable the 2fa.': 2, 'Thanks dude': 1, '> Are you saying that there has never been a case where two people tried to take the same bitcoin address by accident? Where they each independently generated the same password.\n\nI think you are asking about a collision and the odds of that [are rather remote.](http://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/7724/what-happens-if-your-bitcoin-client-generates-an-address-identical-to-another-pe)\n\n"The total number of bitcoins that will ever be mined is 21 million. The smallest bitcoin unit is a satoshi (0.00000001 BTC). If we place all possible satoshis into a wallet of their own, we would get the maximum number of wallets that could have any balance to them (so the actual number of wallets with bitcoins is obviously less). This is 21x10^6(BTC) x 10^8 (satoshi/BTC) = 21 x10^14 wallets. It\'s a huge number, but it\'s eclipsed by 2^256 possible wallets. So in this worst case scenario, the probability of guessing a wallet with one satoshi is 21x10^14 / ( 2^256 ) =1.813595x10^-62 . An incredibly small number."': 1, "> A person's private passwords cannot simply be seen by anyone.\n\nAre you saying that there has never been a case where two people tried to take the same bitcoin address by accident?
