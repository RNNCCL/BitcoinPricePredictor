I have experience in this first hand. Furthermore, Germany only recently (within the last year) introduced a minimum wage.

The calls for German wages to rise "more sharply" is mostly driven by socialists and unions with their erroneous notion that there should be some sort of causal relationship between wages and productivity [implied linear], when in reality wages ought to be set by supply/demand like any other product or service. In a free market, and there are historical (and current) examples of this, wages rise naturally with productivity, there is no need to force this according to some arbitrary criteria.\n\nYou sink production costs by reducing the cost of inputs, of course wages are a part of it, but so are raw materials. A strong currency for an export industry and nation which relies almost entirely on foreign imports is entirely logical, so devaluing the currency isn\'t going to help Germany.

You have to compare productivity. 1 euro's worth of labor in Germany makes more product than 1 euro's worth of labor in Spain, Italy, or Greece.

Many other countries did that too as part of their industrializing process (China is doing it via its exchange rate), and there's nothing unusual about that. But it is a beggar-thy-neighbor policy and it is silly to pretend that its a purely domestic policy with no foreign ramifications.\n\nGermany has kept wages from rising with productivity as a result of its labor negotiation system, something which few other countries in the world have. The state, private firms, and major unions meet periodically to determine wage increases. That process dates back to before World War II, but it was really used to help fuel the Wirtschaftswunder and help integrate East German labor into the newly-unified Germany after the Berlin Wall fell.\n\n[a google source](http://uk.reuters.com/article/2014/08/17/uk-germany-wages-idUKKBN0GH0ME20140817) but I am basing most of my arguments here on scholarly papers that I don't have access to right now.": 2, 'I\'m not "blaming" anyone here.

What happened is that I, the owner, sat down at a table with the governor and the worker\'s union and we agreed that, in the best interests of Germany, the union should keep wages flat for the next ten years. This did good things for German jobs, so my German worker is happily employed. However, at the same time, it resulted in an Italian businessman having to delay or cancel a planned hiring binge. This resulted in Italian stagnation, which hurt its economy and, after 2008, made the difference in gains even more obvious.': 0, 'Germany\'s labor market isn\'t "free." Its system of wage negotiation proves that. Wages are determined, in large part, by the result of the state-firm-union negotiating system. Just as a minimum wage sets the floor for wages, that system sets a floor from which other wages are determined, even if on an ad hoc basis.\n\nThe call for wages to rise, as cited in the article I mentioned before, is explicitly about lessening Germany\'s competitive advantage, which stems from its labor negotiation practices. Hence why that idea is supported by politicians outside of Germany. \n\nGermany\'s wage suppression has been systemic and meaningful.

Furthermore, it is in Germany's best interests to keep it intact, and not just for economic reasons. Germany is extremely reluctant to send troops abroad for fear of reprising its role in starting two world wars, but if it does so as part of the EU at large and with 19 other countries, then it can pursue foreign policy without that concern.\n\nI think they'll probably continue to muddle through it, but I do think that fiscal union is on the horizon.

By that I mean most states (Greece excepted) were following reasonable fiscal policies, with their deficits within reasonable levels. When the global economy collapsed, their tax revenues collapsed with them, and the popping of real estate bubbles (reducing property tax) further reduced their income. Thus, expenditures which had been seen as within healthy ranges pre-2008 were suddenly under-funded (if funded at all).\n\nA large part of the problem is Germany, which took advantage of its labor negotiation practices to keep German wages artificially low. Germany has a history dating back to pre-WWII of state-run firms, the unions, and the state meeting to negotiate wage increases over a period of time. After the collapse of the Berlin Wall and the reunification of Germany, that wage-negotiation structure was used to keep German wages lower. This helped integrate East German workers into the unified German economy.\n\nHowever, it also resulted in a trade surplus for Germany. Productivity increased while wages did not follow suit. Therefore, Germany was able to export products abroad far more cheaply than it would have been able to without the wage structure. This process is not unusual; China's exports are fueled by a similar economic process. However, what it meant was that Germany ran a trade surplus at the expense of its major trading partners - Russia, and the rest of the EU.\n\nOne country's surplus is another country's deficit. So when Germany ran a surplus, Southern Europe ran a trade deficit. That lowered their growth and resulted in stagnating productivity gains. They grew less and less competitive economically due to Germany's policies. When 2008 hit, these structural weaknesses were revealed, and everything went to shit.\n\nSo today, Germany runs around acting as if the Eurozone problem is a story of profligate politicians overspending recklessly. To an extent, that's true. But to a larger extent, the Eurozone problem is a problem of divergent productivity across European regions, fueled by German policies. Other federal systems (for example the US) would compensate for these differences by utilizing fiscal transfers. In the US, the more-productive North sends money to the less-productive South via myriad federal programs, and so there is balance. The Eurozone was not designed to have these kinds of transfers (in no small part due to German reticence to the idea). The ECB's most recent QE action is an attempt to try a type of fiscal transfer, but it is hamstrung by German opposition which resulted in its current, odd form.\n\ntl;dr the Eurozone problem isn't just a sovereign debt problem. This video, in my opinion, treats it as if it is, and that is its justification for a fiscal union. The Eurozone's problems are structural, and fueled by German policies. Fixing them requires more than a fiscal union - it requires a Germany willing to act in the best interests of the EU, and not just itself.

You should also get vaccinated and shower regularly and wash your hands with soap after using the bathroom and consistently before handling foods and between different hazardous raw food types. You should also keep your living area uncluttered and not leave trash, especially food waste, out where it may mold or attract vermin.\n\nThose *cultural* responsibilities we all take for granted today represent the difference between modern and early second millennium hygiene (Bubonic Plague, anyone?), and they *account* for a huge amount of the difference in life expectancy and disease control between then and now. Every one of those practices not only keeps *you* safe, but it also cultivates herd immunity.

I can get a 10 year $100,000 loan at 5% annual interest to get that widget maker *today*, year 0. This will make me an extra $20,000 of profit a year less yearly payments. Since the yearly payments are $12,950.46, for the first 10 years, every year I will make $30,000 less $12,950.46, or  $17049.54. Thus I will be making $7049.54 *more* each year than had I not taken the loan. By the time the loan is paid off in year 11, I will have made $70,495.40 more than I otherwise would have had I not taken the loan, all because I can get that increased return on investment over a 10 year period that I wouldn't have had if I had opted to save before buying instead. And I will still owe $0 in year 10 *just as I would have had I chosen to save instead*. So, in this scenario, I am actually wealthier because I took on debt. \n": 3, 'Sidechains do not  exist.

Packet radio and other digital radio modes allow the transmission of data long distances over radio waves. Higher frequency will give you faster baud rates but at the expense of distance since VHF/UHF and up are line of sight. HF on the other hand is capable of worldwide communications, and depending on the mode, with very little transmit power. Personally I'd look to the 20 meter (14MHz) band since that band is typically open day and night. Where it gets problematic though is the antenna required to transmit on that frequency is going to be big. Like a little over 33' long big. It makes me think mesh netting in the microwave frequencies with centralized HF station acting as the actual blockchain node/clearinghouse to communicate globally with other nodes. \n\nWith there being no power I think signal integrity for global propagation would be pretty reliable.
