Bitcoin is a blockchain (the first blockchain ever) and everything else that Bitcoin is or can be is a derivative of that fact.\n\nHere you can find the details of the first block, or the genesis block:\n\nhttp://blockexplorer.com/block/000000000019d6689c085ae165831e934ff763ae46a2a6c172b3f1b60a8ce26f': 10, 'Bitcoin will change a lot more than finance. It could also change how software is built and upend a bunch of today\'s biggest web companies, argues Joel Monegro of Union Square Ventures.\n\nHis argument starts with the block chain, the shared ledger where every Bitcoin transaction is recorded. Validating these transactions requires computing power. When each transaction is validated, a new block is added to the chain, which makes future transactions even harder to compute.\n\nBitcoin was designed this way to make sure that the same Bitcoin, which has no physical form, isn\'t spent twice by the same person. This also gives Bitcoin some inherent value \xe2\x80\x94 people or organizations have to spend a lot of money to run the computers that validate transactions, and the complexity of those computations is always increasing as the chain gets longer. \n\nBut Monegro argues that these technical underpinnings of the Bitcoin system may have more long-term potential than the currency itself.\n\nThat\'s because the block chain is not controlled by any one person or entity, and information in it is freely available to other software programs. So programmers are starting to build things on top of the block chain that have nothing to do with digital currency. \n\nFor instance, some programmers have developed a protocol called La\'Zooz for real-time ride sharing. That could eventually disrupt Uber. Others have created OpenBazaar, a protocol for a a peer-to-peer trading network that could disrupt eBay. Both use the block chain for some basic computing tasks.\n\nHere\'s a simple way of thinking about it. The block chain itself is immutable, like bedrock.  Bitcoin is like a building on top of that bedrock \xe2\x80\x94 it\'s got a foundation where programmers have defined some of the basics of how it works, then a bunch of stories on top of that where people interact with it.\n\nBut it\'s now possible for other folks to build their own buildings on top of the same bedrock.\n\n"The block chain is great at two fundamental things," explains Monegro. "Distributed consensus, which is basically having a large network of computers agree on a value of something....that\'s a key component for any decentralized system. The other thing is time-stamping, holding a chronological order of things happening." \n\nAs new businesses crop up that depend on these functions, they\'ll benefit from turning to the Bitcoin block chain, rather than having to build a similar system from scratch.\n\nThis concept isn\'t new. Many tech companies have technology platforms that others can build on, from Microsoft to Google to Facebook. \n\nThe Bitcoin block chain is different because everything underlying it is published, and there\'s no central controlling entity. The whole system works only because all the participants abide by the same set of rules, and any changes are dictated by hard math rather than a CEO or board of directors.\n\n"Facebook wants to own and store the data that is relevant to their operation," says Monegro. "So does Google, so does everyone else. The data they store, they control it. The algorithms they run, they control it to serve their own purposes. A system like this, the protocols you build are open, not controlled by anybody. They work like a machine. They don\'t discriminate."\n\nThere\'s still reason to be skeptical. Bitcoin itself is still in a very early and tumultuous stage, as the collapse of the Mt. Gox exchange earlier this year showed. Speculation has caused some pretty wild price fluctuations \xe2\x80\x94 one Bitcoin is worth about $375 today, down from a peak of $1,242 in March 2013. That makes it an unreliable store of value, which could eventually drive people away.\n\nPlus, the organizations building on top of the block chain tend to speak in utopian terms that could be a turn-off for outsiders. For instance, La\'Zooz describes itself as "a completely decentralized and autonomous organisation. That means that anyone can contribute towards the establishment of its goals in whatever way he or she believes would be the best. Tasks are carried out within autonomous, self-defined circles or teams."\n\nBut that kind of utopian vision is how a lot of open-source projects started, and many of them have grown into essential technology. Take the Linux operating system, which runs most of the computers in the biggest data centers in the world, like your bank. Or Apache, which runs the majority of web servers. Or the protocols that formed the basis of the Internet itself.\n\nMonegro and USV\'s Fred Wilson think that Bitcoin could become the same kind of foundational building block within the next 5 to 10 years.\n\nMonegro\'s entire post is worth reading if you\'re interested in the technical vision. Here\'s a graphic showing the different layers of the platform he believes will built on the block chain, which he\'s going to detail in a set of follow-up posts:\n\nblockchain app stack\n\n\nRead more: http://www.businessinsider.com/how-bitcoin-could-change-everything-not-just-finance-2014-12#ixzz3KhnulOBf\n': 10, "hahaha thanks u/NiceGuyLuke \nYou didn't have to lure me into bitCoin though.

That's a decorative coin with no 'bitcoin' stored on it.  Bitcoin is a digital currency that is essentially stored and spent and shared from addresses - they are spent with a long complex number called a private key and often times will need a seperate password along with this private key to be spent.  You're looking for sheets of paper that have qr codes on them and/or those long numbers which will look like a long string of text and numbers like this:  \n>     5Kb8kLf9zgWQnogidDA76MzPL6TsZZY36hWXMssSzNydYXYB9KF    \n\nBut likely your roomate stored their bitcoin on their smartphone or their laptop computer.

One thing you can do is enlarge electrum to the whole screen, then click wallet and then "Master Public Key".  You can then use the Master Public Key to create a watch only wallet in electrum.\n\nThe one weakness I see in your implementation is that the USB could be corrupted and transferring it back and forth to the offline device could create a weakness, which you seem to know about.  Possibly if you could find a way to put the raw transaction into QR code form, and then transfer the QR code instead of USB, your set-up would be more bullet proof.

Although offline it could still be compromised physically. To protect you may want to use Armory's Secure Print option so the printer never sees the private keys either.

I can not even tell you how stupid the people were who drafted this bill, I don\'t even want to get into the difference between serpentine and amphiboles, but holy fuck, do you think a REPORTER on this political issue could UNDERSTAND Serpentine vs. Amphiboles?  LOLOLOLOLOLOL.  And, I can\'t expect them to.  So, when an article would come out and have some scientific errors, I mean...damn...could I really blame the reporter for not having a boner for asbestos like I do?"\n\nLook, my blogs are just that...blogs.  the WSJ "blog" is not just a "blog", it is a big section of the WSJ and news from the blog can go mainstream if they get enough attention.  \n\nIt is not that journalist\'s job to cast a judgement.  Look, Mighty CEO goes there, he is all positive about his new thing.  add in cantor-fitzgerald and blingo-blongo, if I was a reporter, I would report on what I was given.  How disingenuous is it to demand all journalists to be both experts in SPECIFIC subject they are writing about and to be an investigative journalist in addition.  \n\nThe comments blew up and gee...I know at least ONE person that talked to that reporter...so, the reporter took our claims, went to josh, got his answers and you know, that is the most damning of all.

No doubt he and his team are doing this in the WSJ comments as well. \n\nBoth WSJ blog posts about GAW serve only to promote the scam, and only attempt to debunk criticisms rather than actually investigating them. They also completely ignore huge warning signs about the legitimacy of GAW. Considering all the red flags, no aspect of GAW should be taken at face value, and the WSJ blogger managed to take everything at face value.\n\nIt is apparent that either the WSJ blogger has some type of incentive to write favorably about GAW, or he hasn\'t taken to the time to actually look into the company, in which case he shouldn\'t be writing about them at all.': 2, 'Hold up, the author of this was not PAID by Josh.
