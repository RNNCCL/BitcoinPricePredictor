The recipient must then scan all transactions on the block chain to find incoming transactions.\n\nWith BIP 47, the sender first negotiates a shared secret with the recipient via the block chain. Then using elliptic curve math along with this shared secret, the sender can generate very many addresses for this recipient, and the recipient can generate the private keys that are associated with these addresses. Both the sender and recipient will generate addresses in the same order, so the recipient can just watch for transactions to the next address in the sequence. Like stealth addresses, there is no publicly-computable link between the recipient\'s public identity and these derived addresses, which provides some privacy advantages.\n\nThis is claimed to be better for SPV users because the recipient can just use the "normal way" of finding incoming transactions instead of scanning the entire block chain. You\'re just watching a list of regular Bitcoin addresses, after all. But the thing is, the "normal way" is terribly insecure. SPV wallets send a bloom filter of all of their addresses to *untrusted* network peers, relying on them to forward relevant transactions, but bloom filters have been shown to leak information like crazy. If you\'re using SPV and you happen to connect to someone who is watching you long-term, it\'s likely that they will be able to construct a list of many of the addresses in your wallet, which can deanonymize you even if you\'re using Tor. Stealth addresses are typically used in the same way (the wallet asks a server somewhere to do the processing for them, compromising anonymity), so I don\'t see much real-world advantage anonymity-wise compared to stealth addresses.\n\nI think that BIP 47 is probably superior to stealth addresses. It does result in less transaction data than stealth addresses overall if the sender will ever send more than one transaction to a given recipient, and (though I\'m not an expert on it,) it seems better-thought-out in general. And it\'s better than the current status quo of widespread address reuse. But hopefully something better will be created. In particular, it should be possible to set up this sort of thing without touching the block chain at all, which would be much better for efficiency/scalability and anonymity.': 17, "Very impressive post by Theymos, indeed.
