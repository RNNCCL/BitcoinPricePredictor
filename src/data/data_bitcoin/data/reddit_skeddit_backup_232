If you buy some Bitcoin, use it to buy something, and they turn it into cash, then the market hasn't changed much and there is no change in value.\n\nHowever, if 1,000,000 people all try to do that at the same time, the price will be pushed up as there are a lot of people buying and those selling will just ask for more.\n\nIf you expect to use it quickly then it doesn't matter what costs, so there very little downward pressure on the price if everyone wants it.

This is why the prices fluctuates and doesn't keep going up.  In fact, as more stores started accepting it, it had a negative effect on the price.  People who already owned Bitcoin were able to buy things, but the stores don't want to hold Bitcoin so they would sell it immediately.

It doesn't matter whether they are $10 or $10,000,000 for an hour of work and a pair of socks, the purchase decision is the same.
