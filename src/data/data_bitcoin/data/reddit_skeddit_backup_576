With the creation of the FDIC, aimed for the people, the government was able to truly able to bring together the rich (insurers) with the poor (people with bank accounts) and mitigate bad actors who threatened everyone\n\n^**WARNING:** ^I ^am ^going ^to ^give ^a ^History ^lesson ^at ^the ^risk ^of ^being ^ignored ^due ^to ^this ^post\'s ^length..\n\nWho were some of the bad actors?  You can look internationally for them:\n\n* [Sir Thomas McllWraith](http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/mcilwraith-sir-thomas-4099) (australia)\n* [The Baring Brothers, Jabez Spencer Balfour, Whitaker Wright, Horatio Bottomley, Clarence Hatry, and Lord\nKylsant](http://gale.cengage.co.uk/images/FT%20Scandals%20and%20Debacles.pdf) (UK)\n* [Charles Ponzi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Ponzi), [Ivar Krueger](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivar_Kreuger), [Samuel Insull](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Insull) (US)\n\n[Here is an interesting document which shows the transition from individual causing financial scandals to corporations profiting from financial scandals](http://www.bizethics.org/files/Corporate_Scandals_and_Macroeconomic_Impact.ppt).  What is interesting to note is before the US had control of the monetary system (pre-1930 FDIC) there was no shortage of scandal.  After the FDIC intertwined insurers money with individual money, the scandals shifted to corporate greed albeit at much lower frequencies (eg once per decade rather than once every few years).  After the 1970s [Nixon Shock](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nixon_Shock), the frequency of scandals dropped dramatically.  One only needs to look at what was done during this time to understand the benefits to everyone.\n\nIn 1913 the government created the Federal Reserve to ensure economic activity would not be disrupted by a few wealthy billionaires.  The rich at this time would cause volatility in the stock markets by using their large stash of USD to skew trades in their favor.  Or in other words, the pump and dump.  Typically only largecap companies weathered the storm (US Steel, Union Pacific, etc).  In 1930, during the great depression there was nothing the US could do to encourage economic activity.  The US [Government threw money at national projects, at corporate sponsored projects, but didn\'t do anything to address the lack of money in the majority of citizen\'s pockets.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression#United_States)  A majority of people did not have any money in their bank account and could not get loans.  In 1933, the government finally addressed the people by creating [the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Deposit_Insurance_Corporation) to oversee banking failures and ensure citizen\'s money was not lost when a bank collapsed.  40 years later [the same problems from 1930 which caused the great depression, pegging the economy to the gold standard](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression#Gold_standard), began to appear again which prompted Nixon to remove our reliance on the gold standard.  [While at the time was seen as an attempt to hide Nixon\'s famous foreign and domestic blunders](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Nixon) has been praised for allowing economies to grow based upon their economic output.\n\nSo, /u/b_coin, why are you bringing all of this up?  Because a lot of people in this sub, /r/bitcoin tend to believe that bitcoin and removal of the FDIC, going back to a gold (or other) standard, and allowing persons and corporations to control your money without providing insurance is a good thing.  But history has shown this to not be the case.  History has shown that the government sitting idly as bad actors manipulate the economy does not benefit the citizens.  Further, history has shown the US being unable to inject assets into the economy to weather a storm.  It took the US forcing the rich to look after the poor to allow our economy to grow^*.  With that said, we are not in a particularly bad state but I agree we should not wait until we are in a bad state.  With that said, we should not knee-jerk into old habits (eg be your own bank! get rid of FDIC!) nor should we follow directions which we know won\'t work (eg removing the fed and thus government\'s ability to help the poor).  We should entirely be aware of who we are giving our money to (eg [John D Rockafeller](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_D._Rockefeller)).  \n\nI leave you with a comparison.  [Bitcoin does not allow governments to inflate the monetary supply](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression#Debt_deflation) ensuring the rich get richer while the poor have no recourse.

This guy is talking out of his ass.': 3, "> The startup, insured by its own Xapo Insurance Limited\n\nLol Xapo's insurance company is Xapo": 29, "OK, I'm glad my take away was correct... :)": 1, 'A bitcoin business can be a red flag to an insurer, but insurers are in the business of evaluating and taking on risk if the money is right. You can\'t just call up and say "hey, I\'ve got a business that hosts peoples bitcoin wallets, will you insure me?".\n\nBut if you\'ve got $40 mil of VC funding, I\'m certain that all but the biggest insurers would be happy to learn about bitcoin and its attendant risks in order to see if they could come up with a policy that would make both parties happy.\n\nWhether a business is ethical or not is nonsense. There\'s no way to judge ones ethicalness in the present, only at the end of a sequence of events. I mean, I could start the most ethical of bitcoin wallet services and come up with the most absolutely perfect way to hold other peoples bitcoins, with the idea that once I\'ve amassed $100 million in holdings, I\'m flicking the switch and walking away with everything. \n\nAs far as good security practices go... We see too often, all these exchanges and wallets that claim to have great security, well it turns out they didn\'t. Some even try to repay their customers using their own reserves.... Which is, essentially, self-insurance, \n\nNo.\n\nBring in an outside insurer and risk manager. They\'ll learn or hire expertise in the Bitcoin space, and do a thorough evaluation of the systems at play. Maybe they\'ll say "all looks good to us, your premium is $X per year". Or maybe they\'ll say, "we like most of what we see, but we won\'t cover you until you create a new private key for your cold storage, and divide it into 4 pieces that will be held by your 4 top officers".\n\nAgain, that\'s what insurers do. I was acquainted actually acquainted with the former chief underwriting officer of a small insurer, to watch how the guy though was fascinating, whether he was discussing insurance or any other topic.\n\nTo close out - if your spin-off is capitalized enough to absorb 100% of potential losses, then self insurance is fine. Because when exchanges go bust, they go bust in big ways... They don\'t say "hackers broke into our systems and stole coins from 25 accounts", they say "hackers emptied our cold wallet, all customers are affected". If that spin-off isn\'t capitalized enough to do that, then there\'s no point in it at all - the company could just pay out from whatever reserves it maintained.\n\nSo, no. I\'m not buying this self insurance line. Especially when he isn\'t charging premiums, and having plans to cover other wallets and exchanges. And I\'d urge anyone thinking to store their coins with Xapo to really think through that decision. Know that Xapo will present a much bigger target than any lone individual would ever be. And yes, it\'s fairly straight forward to securely store your coins without their assistance, rather than taking their word for it.\n': 1, 'I don\'t know a lot about the Xapo situation (I\'ll have to read up on it), but it\'s a false assumption to assert that attempting to absorb all of your claims liabilities yourself is the same as self insurance. In the states (I presume in the UK as well), insurance is heavily regulated - and in the US is done so on the state level. NY and CT lead the charge here and you can\'t be considered insured from a regulatory perspective unless you pass certain reserve requirements which significantly alter the equation as compared to absorbing all of our claims losses in cash. Three quick examples to illustrate (in ascending order of regulatory approval and often efficiency):\n\na) You promise to pay all claims and losses, but those are just promises\n\nb) You make the same promise, but you back that promise with a static pool of dead money as a reserve, that may or may not have been calculated by underwriting the risks involved.\n\nc) You underwrite the risks put together monies and segregated accounts\n\nd) You take C and cap our risks by buying stop loss insurance to limit your risk to X%\n\ne) You take C and sell off a portion of the risk to a reinsurer, thereby (theoretically, depending or correlation/concentration risk and the true creditworthiness of you reinsurer) reducing the amounts you actually have to hold in reserves.\n\nf) You create a captive insurer offshore in a domicile that has materially lower underwriting, reserve and capital requirements than someplace stateside like NY or CT, to cover your risks and call yourself insured by your captive. Keep in mind that your captive can easily employ stop loss, reinsurance, or can be writing policies on other risks for income and to diversify and alter its risk profile, or the captive can have other investors (in equity) as well. Now, many strong financial entities do this and are well protected, then again many are also shams that are dressed well too.\n\nAs you can see, there are too many variables to just say "since he\'s self-insured, he is absorbing the risk of loss himself". Self insurance should be the same as commercial insurance, economically and if set up correctly, sans the savings to the self insured of profit to the for-profit entity, and probably an increase in administrative costs due to lower economies of scale.': 1, "It's actually surprisingly worse than the average /r/bitcoin user's inhouse security.": 7, '> Biometric sensors = fingerprints sensors in their iphones.\n\nNah a lot of DC\'s are upgrading to Biometric.

I mean, operating a Bitcoin business is itself a huge red flag for an insurer.  How does one underwrite a Bitcoin business with all the scams plus all the security gotchas that insurance companies are unlikely to grok.\n\nBut if you are operating an *ethical* business, and using good security practices, then the cost to insure really should be quite low, because Bitcoin does offer very strong security features when used correctly.  So it would make sense, if you were operating such a business, to self-insure through a spinoff.\n\nNote I'm not defending Xapo, just pointing out that self-insurance is both indicative of good or bad business, depending on the situation.": 3, "Great article.

When the insurance co moves forward and starts insuring other exchanges and wallets, it'll be an even bigger issue.\n\nBut really, unless you're Warren Buffett, I don't think self-insurance should be considered insurance... I mean, I could start a wallet service and set up a separate company that I call the insurer, and say that all accounts are insured, but does that really mean anything?\n\nPlus, that the insurance is now free (rather than the 0.12% per year he initially wanted to charge), that raises more questions about his capacity to insure large amounts...  And why would Xapo Insurance Limited's investors want to put funds into an incredibly risky insurance company which has no income, just huge liability exposures? (I say incredibly risky because, aside from Xapo's security systems... which sound impressive, but to my knowledge haven't been subject to a third party audit... if he's insuring other exchanges and wallets, unless he's mandating that they all hold their customer assets as he does, then losses WILL occur. Fact of life. Fact of bitcoin that we see too often.).\n\nWhat would be impressive is if he approached an external insurer. Be it a boutique insurer, one of Berkshire Hathaway's units (his chief underwriting officer is known to underwrite extremely uncommon liabilities), or even a Lloyds syndicate.

The reward could be paid out in lots of 10% from n+1...n+10, or 1% from n+1...n+100, or in any possible mathematical arrangement you like. Regardless, the chance of solving any given block is purely based on one's share of the network hashrate, and whether a miner has just solved a block or not it doesn't make a difference (like how flipping a tails does not make the next coinflip more likely to be tails.) So even if the reward is paid out in block n+1, unless there is some detail of how mining works I'm not familiar with, overall the mean block rewards are still being distributed evenly proportional to share of hashing power.\n\nIn the case of Bitcoin mining there is actually a risk that a miner with a sufficiently large amount of hashing can slightly game the coin toss example. If a selfish miner withholds block announcements then they are able to work on a subsequent block at the expense of other miners. If the reward could be deferred for some significant period of time, however, then that particular effect can be ignored (no-one can mine a sufficiently long chain).\n\nBack to the original question though: The problem of voting on block rewards is the same as that of transaction fees. The new reward has to be implemented in the form of an additional fee charge on future transactions (we're not generating new coins). This has the same problem as transaction fees: No user of the system will choose to vote up the reward and thus make their future transactions more expensive.\n\nThere's also a problem with having the fees decided by voting as opposed to having a known minimum fee at a fixed block height. When a user issues a transaction they will have to include sufficient funds to cover the transaction fee, but now also some future mining reward. If a transaction takes number of blocks to be included in a block then there's a real risk that it carries an insufficiently large quantity to meet the new reward level. This risk increases with block reorgs.\n\nFinally the other problem here is that this would represent a massive shift in the consensus code. We'd now have a new consensus-critical characteristic and which would also require that SPV wallets would now have to maintain a large amount of state about previous reward calculations in order to determine how much to add to transactions to form new rewards.": 1, 'Simple as that.

Otherwise the only parties that will be able to access the blockchain will be large intermediary aggregrators like banks. ": 1, "> No user of the system will choose to vote up the reward and thus make their future transactions more expensive.\n\n1. I think there would be a large number of people, including many large entities, who *would* care about network security, would be willing to put their money where their mouth is, and counteract those who just want cheap fees. Look at what happened after [Heartbleed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_Infrastructure_Initiative) for instance. \n2. If the network is processing a lot of transactions, fees would probably still be very small, so a lot of users would probably be content with the current fee and not vote it down.\n3. Popular wallets might not even expose this functionality to users (or hide it in settings, and we all know how many people stick with default settings...) and instead make decisions on behalf of their userbase. \n4. People who want to downvote the reward are probably going to pay the minimum or below-minimum fee, making their vote less effective.\n\nAnyway until something like this is tried I don't believe we can know for sure what the results would be in terms of user response.\n\n> If a transaction takes number of blocks to be included in a block then there's a real risk that it carries an insufficiently large quantity to meet the new reward level.\n\nI suspect that Tx fees would actually be quite stable in my scenario. I certainly wouldn't expect large spikes or dips. Regardless, if the blocksize limit was removed, then any Tx that pays below the base fee needs a corresponding Tx paying a premium to allow a miner to include their Tx. The basic dynamic is the same as with a classical Tx fee, if you want more speed and certainty, pay a premium. Otherwise you can trade off cost for the risk of waiting longer or never being confirmed.\n\nOn another note it should be possible again to smooth out the results of voting to avoid large spikes or dips.\n\n> This risk increases with block reorgs.\n\nIf two chains are being worked on in parallel, both chains will overwhelmingly receive the same transactions at roughly the same time, and thus the results of voting should be the same for both chains. I don't think block reorgs are a big deal to be honest, at the end of the day if you want to pay a small premium on the reward fee to safeguard against the small risk of a block reorg, you can.\n\n> Finally the other problem here is that this would represent a massive shift in the consensus code.\n\nIf my analysis is right, the network will not be sustainable in the long run without some big changes to the way hashing power is funded. Ultimately the network will accept a new consensus characteristic if miners can be convinced that it is necessary to do so to preserve the value of their operations, so I don't see that as being a dealbreaker at all. The alternative is outcompetition at the hands a more rationally-designed processing network once sidechains come into play. If I'm right about this issue, then something has to be done, whether it's my idea or not. I think my take is pretty good, I'm sure there are other ways of tackling it, but if you agree with me that something has to be done then the only question is what.\n\n> SPV wallets would now have to maintain a large amount of state about previous reward calculations in order to determine how much to add to transactions to form new rewards.\n\nWould they? Miners and full nodes would perform all the real calculations, and the minimum fee and voting result could be included as a trivial amount of extra information in each block (possibly in the block header?) SPV clients already make a trade off between trustlessness and low resource use, why would getting data about the current state of minimum fees be more problematic than verifying Txs without the full blockchain?": 1, 'I\'m actually a little confused, I can\'t quite work out with most of what you\'re saying whether you\'re asking me why a) in the current status quo transactions should pay fees higher than the lowest price miners will accept or b) in my proposed regimen Txs would pay anything higher than the network-determined minimum reward fee?\n\nTo answer the first interpretation, that is exactly the problem I\'ve defined and which we\'ve been discussing. In the absence of any requirement to pay towards an additional fund for network security, Tx fees will trend to the equilibrium price of paying a miner for the cost of validating and including the Tx, and will not fund security. We need transactions to pay an additional fee for a minimum block reward to fund security. \n\nMy argument is about how the size of the block reward should be determined (I say democratic voting) and how it should be paid (I argue for a separate fee additional to Tx fees, which the miner of the current block cannot access.) So just to be clear there would be TWO fees - the normal Tx fee we have today, which the miner of the current block has, and an additional fee to fund the block reward for subsequent blocks, which the miner of that block *cannot* access. If the block reward was based on the KB size of the block, then the miner would not include Txs that did not pay the fee, or could only include them if other Txs had overpaid proportionally.\n\nTo answer the second interpretation:\n\n1) The network will have agreed that blocks that do not satisfy the block reward gathering requirement will not be valid. So if a miner puts together a block which does not meet the current fee per kB requirement, other nodes will reject it.\n\n2) People who think the network hashrate is too low or high (ie the network is under or overpaying for security) will be able to use the fee paid for the block reward to vote for their opinion. This means some people will overpay the fee. Some large entities with a strong interest in the health of the Bitcoin network (e.g. large corporations, Bitpay, Coinbase, et al) will conceivably pay significantly more than they need to, perhaps making transactions which only pay towards the reward. This system should have the same resilience as the Bitcoin network itself, most participants will be honest and vote for a fee which is optimal (i.e. enough security without overpaying), and even if one or more participants try to "crash" the system, other honest voters will act to counter their votes, and ultimately the attacker will just waste money which goes towards the support of the network.\n\nNote that because some actors will overpay the reward, this will allow miners to accept some Txs which do not pay towards the reward.\n\n> One problem with the idea of the next block determining fees for the block after is that this definitely changes the mining incentives too. In particular it may well incentivise forms of selfish mining because it has the potential to encourage any miner to try to maximise the reward for the next block and to then try to claim that block too.\n\nThere is no reason why the reward gathered in block n needs to be paid out 100% in block n+1. The reward could be paid out in lots of 10% from n+1...n+10, or 1% from n+1...n+100, or in any possible mathematical arrangement you like. Regardless, the chance of solving any given block is purely based on one\'s share of the network hashrate, and whether a miner has just solved a block or not it doesn\'t make a difference (like how flipping a tails does not make the next coinflip more likely to be tails.) So even if the reward is paid out in block n+1, unless there is some detail of how mining works I\'m not familiar with, overall the mean block rewards are still being distributed evenly proportional to share of hashing power.\n\nAdditionally, the incentive will still remain for miners to include as many Txs as possible in the current block, as long as those Txs pay them a fee which equals or exceeds the cost of including the Tx.\n\nReally appreciate your comments and critique by the way :)': 1, "You can help us get started and build things faster. Andreas' book and the Princeton-based free online course are two great places to start. It is a little difficult to understand at first, but anybody with a passion for computers can get the hang of it after the first few chapters/weeks.\n\nI agree completely that people should have direct access to the blockchain, and they absolutely will, but not likely as their main payment mechanism. Bitcoin is perfectly suited to be the reserve currency of every country, bank, and individual, but not necessarily the currency used to buy lunch and a movie ticket. It will be used exactly the way that gold should be used today: mostly kept in a vault but still able to be spent at a moment's notice if needed.\n\ntl;dr We're working on it, and we'll get there soon enough.": 1, 'Because bitcoin is the reserve commodity of the internet. Real currency, which is always and only backed by a limited reserve commodity (gold/silver), is essentially a side chain or off chain transaction of whatever is backing it. When the dollar was an actual currency, it was essentially a side chain or off chain form of gold. That does not, in any way, reduce the absolute necessity for the blockchain or gold standard.': 3, '> No, transaction fees do not pay for network security. Miners should be willing to accept any transaction whose fee equals or exceeds the price of including it. So over time the equilibrium transaction fee will equal this cost and nothing more. Therefore there must be som additional forced fee requirement to pay for network security. At the moment the forced fee is inflation. In the future, because Bitcoin assumes a fixed monetary base, we need some other way to enforce fees for network security. It has to happen.\n\nIt\'s not clear to me why transaction fees shouldn\'t pay for network security? If we say "transactions are free, but if you want to see security pay an extra amount" then that\'s essentially the same as saying "pay larger transaction fees". This is a problem of incentives for anyone making transactions; what\'s making the transaction pay larger fees of any description other than a protocol mandated minimum?\n\nIn the absence of any form of scarcity that generates a competitive market, or a protocol-mandated requirement for particular fees in order to achieve some particular result then it\'s not clear to me what will ever make anyone pay more than the minimum they can get away with?\n\nFor example, say blocks were magically to become 20 Mbytes in size then every outstanding transaction would fit in any "next" block so a miner would be insane to do anything than take every transaction possible, no matter how low the fees (of any sort). Any miner who ignores transactions in the current block is merely handing them to the next miner and the next block.\n\nThe problem of incentives is highly tricky. One problem with the idea of the next block determining fees for the block after is that this definitely changes the mining incentives too. In particular it may well incentivise forms of selfish mining because it has the potential to encourage any miner to try to maximise the reward for the next block and to then try to claim that block too.': 1, "that's essentially what being offchain is...\nyou don't really need to actually hold bitcoins if all you want is a cup of coffee": 0, 'How would you stop me as a miner from producing 100s of transactions to myself that all up vote the block reward or just not including in a block any transactions that down vote the reward?': 8, 'Yes but Gavin offers no solution. Instead he proposes building an expensive version of Paypal where mining is centralized.': -1, "I also floated the idea of a 'block fee', except I had the block fee the miner of block N pays claimed by the miner of block N+25. This was to prevent certain subversions where a miner claims their own block fee when they mine a certain number of blocks consecutively.\n\nIn my proposal, miners input two values into their mining client: the price of BTC in their local currency and the price of bandwidth in their local currency. With these two values, the client calculates the cost of bandwidth in BTC. This single value is then encoded in any block they generate, and at the end of each difficulty period, a new network value for the 'bandwidth/BTC' is determined, using the values inputted in the preceding 2016 blocks, either through a Schelling Point vote, or a decrement/increment mechanism (e.g. every block is a vote for either increasing or decreasing the value by some fixed tiny percentage point, and at the end of the difficulty period, the net votes for either an increase or decrease determine the direction and proportion of change in the network price of bandwidth/BTC). A variation on the increment/decrement proposal was to make the mechanisn modify a difficulty:price ratio, rather than directly modify the network price, and have the difficulty be the direct deteminant of network price, based on the miner determined ratio. The rationale for this would be that difficulty often tracks the real world price, and thus having the network price track difficulty might reduce the need for intervention by miners.\n\nThis price for bandwidth would then be multiplied by some magic number that we hardcode, to approximate the number of full node miners we think we need (e.g. 1000), to determine the amount that each kB of transaction data in a block contributes to the mandatory block fee that the block's generator pays forward. This way, miners who generate larger blocks are paying for the bandwidth that other miners are consuming due to their large block.\n\nWhat I finally concluded is that this is too complex, and therefore likely to introduce a weakness, and only a proposal like what Gavin forwarded would work.": 2, "So the banks handle the good stuff (gold), and everyone else has to make due with promissory notes. I'd rather the Bitcoin blockchain be accessible to the world, and not the exclusive purview of banks.

The miner doing the upvoting wouldn't just get the reward back, it would go to whoever mined the next block.\n2. You could separate the transaction fee which goes to the miner from the fee to pay for the block reward. Miners who forfeit a down-vote containing transaction would therefore be forfeiting their own fees. The incentive would be stronger to accept the transactions because the overall impact on the miner of the reward decrease would be outweighed by the value of those transactions.": 1, 'In general it\'s safe to say that both users and wallets will drive their fees to the lowest level that they can get away with. This is a "classic tragedy of the commons problem". You can just imagine wallets being marketed as "works to reduce your fees" and uninformed users being delighted to see this happen. If you look at the BTC-denominated fees they are running at historical lows right now; almost no-one pays more than they absolutely have to.\n\n> If two chains are being worked on in parallel, both chains will overwhelmingly receive the same transactions at roughly the same time, and thus the results of voting should be the same for both chains. I don\'t think block reorgs are a big deal to be honest, at the end of the day if you want to pay a small premium on the reward fee to safeguard against the small risk of a block reorg, you can.\n\nThis is a steady-state view, but not one that considers risks. If an attacker wished to cause chaos they could easily push a block that plays havoc with the fees unless the fees are weighted over a very long period of time (in which case up and down votes have very marginal advantage). The problem with the heavy weighting, however, is the statefulness requirement again (for SPV clients).\n\nTrivial block reorgs are very common. We typically see a couple of orphan blocks per day, but over the last few years reorgs of up to 4 blocks have been observed\n\n> If I\'m right about this issue, then something has to be done, whether it\'s my idea or not. I think my take is pretty good, I\'m sure there are other ways of tackling it, but if you agree with me that something has to be done then the only question is what.\n\nI definitely agree that something has to be done to sustain mining rewards of one form or another (I\'ve done a lot of analysis on this over the last 6 months), but changes that affect the consensus code are pretty-much guaranteed to be rejected by the core dev team without an extremely detailed analysis. Even Gavin\'s proposed block size increase has caused a huge amount of debate, not least because it will prevent fees in their current form from ever becoming a basis for a commercial market.\n\nIn practice I suspect sidechains will end up being the way forward here and the main chain will see higher fees but larger transfers of value.\n\nAs regards SPV clients, yes they accept a lower level of security but transactions sent via an SPV client aren\'t second-class in that those SPV clients aren\'t additionally disadvantaged in terms of whether their transactions will be mined or not. Now we\'d be seeing a new additional restriction on their capabilities.\n\nThe main problem here is that in order to accept any change at all there\'s going to be a huge analytical barrier. The design will need to be analysed for any theoretical weaknesses and consensus risks. That will be a huge undertaking. There will also be the problem that the design will be compared with "well why don\'t we just make the minimum transaction fee per kbyte 10x what it is now?" as that involves a much smaller set of changes and carries far fewer potential risks.': 1, "Businesses that provide free services will make revenue through advertisements and should pay a portion of this revenue to the miners in order to keep the network secure.
