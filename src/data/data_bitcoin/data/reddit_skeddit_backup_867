Not only that, but those who do get into mining go in knowing that this will happen. I don't see why it would be different next halving.\n\nYou're also not accounting for higher transaction volume. If bitcoin becomes more popular over time, more transactions means more fee collecting. So the fee doesn't necessarily need to increase much (or maybe even at all), because the same amounts will be collected more frequently.": 3, "Yes, the idea is that the latter case would happen. I mean in 2140 they're only going to be mining tiny fractions of bitcoins anyway, nothing like what they're getting today, so for even that to be profitable bitcoin would have to be much more valuable, which would make mining for transaction fees a reasonable proposition at that point, 126 years from now.": 2, "I think you missed the part where 99% of bitcoins will have been mined already less than 20 years from now \n\n>so for even that to be profitable bitcoin would have to be much more valuable\n\nOr, if it isn't more valuable (again, in just 10-20 years), transaction fees will skyrocket. the price of the commodity won't naturally rise as a result of the block reward diminishing, either the price naturally rises and small fractions of BTC are enough to pay miners bills or transaction fees are going to shoot to the moon or people will just stop using Bitcoin altogether for a different coin that hasn't been mined out and hasn't had its difficulty raised to a ridiculous degree": 1, "It's just that you referenced the problem as 126 years away when it's actually much, much closer than that. \n\nAll I'm saying is that anybody who owns Bitcoin had better hope adoption rates increase dramatically and the price alongside it or they're going to be paying some steep transaction fees.

If your boss told you your paycheque was going to be cut in half next week, and then again next year, would you be as relaxed about the schedule? \n\nMillions upon millions of dollars spent on equipment for mining bitcoins will become immensely less profitable while difficulty continues to rise amid the bitcoin gold rush. This means you\'ll be paying higher transaction fees every time the price halves assuming the actual value of bitcoin and volume of the network grows at an incredible pace, much faster than what we\'re experiencing now.

How can either one of us say? I was just offering a possibility. I don't think it's unreasonable to expect that over time, the value of bitcoin and the total number of transactions will increase, making the revenue that can be pulled from only transaction fees incentive enough to mine.": 3, 'I don\'t feel the same way - that it is a sudden cliff we will reach and fall off the edge of.\n\nBlocks rewards will cut in half every four years. In the long term that seems sudden when most of it has already been released after 20 years, but at each specific step 1/2 is not that drastic, and combined with a theoretically increasing value over time and more rewarding tx fees, I imagine it will be a smooth easing, not a "problem" that is very close.\n\nI understand that you feel differently. I think we have to agree to disagree.': 3, '>but we\'ve already been through this in the past and mining has kept chugging along\n\nYou can\'t honestly compare the two situations. The last block reward halving happened at a time before VC invested millions in Bitcoins, before enormous mining companies invested millions in equipment to extract the block reward. The next halving is occuring in an entirely different era of bitcoin and there\'s no reason to believe it won\'t have a profound effect on the bottom line of big mining pools and accordingly on the bottom line of every bitcoin transaction. \n\nRemember, the block reward accounts for 99.75% of miner revenue. They lose 50% of that 99.75% and either hundreds of people shut down the digital gold rush or people hike up the transaction fees. \n\nI\'m accounting for the growth in transactional volume that bitcoin currently enjoys, that is to say practically none. Over the last year the number of transactions in the network hasn\'t grown anywhere near the pace it would have to grow to "equally" offset the lost block reward. It\'s a solution, but not one we\'re remotely on track enough to consider practical. \n\nEither the price of a bitcoin skyrockets and miners still get their 99% by minign fractions of a bitcoin or the miners raise transaction fees or they shut down/switch to a more profitable coin, lowering the security of bitcoin. It\'s going to be a mess for sure, and certainly anything but seamless \n\nif you\'re a mining company and you have a $1M electrical bill to mine $1.25M worth of Bitcoin one month and the next month you have a $1M electrical bill to mine $625,000 worth of Bitcoin, you have to get your money from somewhere else or you shut down, and people who have invested millions won\'t want to be the first to shut down.

I want to start off by saying I don't want anything, and I don't mean to spam.  \nI was working in LA last week, and convinced some Youtubers ([Bree Essrig](https://www.youtube.com/user/BREEessrig) and [Brooke Marks](https://www.youtube.com/user/BrookeMarksthespot)) to make a video about Bitcoin. I have a feeling this video would eventually be x-posted here, and if you guys think it's STUPID (spoiler alert: it is) or annoying, I want to be the one that takes the comment criticism instead of the girls, because it's my fault.\nOnce they said yes to the idea, I found out pretty quickly that it's not easy to explain Bitcoin concepts without getting bogged down and technical, and it's especially hard to try and make the information \xe2\x80\x9cfunny\xe2\x80\x9d. I did my best to boil down the concepts into little blurbs. I believe eventually someone else will do this kind of Bitcoin video much better.  \nThere ARE already some excellent videos explaining \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is Bitcoin\xe2\x80\x9d, including several animated videos, and almost anything where [andreasma](http://www.reddit.com/user/andreasma) is talking (My favorite is his [Jefferson Club Dinner video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JP9-lAYngi4)). This video includes nods to the r/bitcoin content I've enjoyed very much, ([like this awesome time-lapse animation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTILX-_JzTs) depicting the version control/collaborations on the protocol, and the articles on Bitcoin mining operations like [this one by thecoinsman.](http://www.thecoinsman.com/2014/08/bitcoin/inside-chinese-bitcoin-mine/))  \nThe morning we shot this, I had a two-hour conversation about Bitcoin with Brooke and her boyfriend Brett Erlich (he's a TV show host, a Stanford grad, and a very bright and nice guy.) We wrote some jokes on the fly, Bree came over, and then we started filming. I can't help but feel it could have been done better, but it was just one thing Brooke and I shot in a long work day.  \nI know the end result is a little dopey and easy, but when it comes to Youtube community, there are a good population of people there who respond to that tone, and even more who stare at boobs. So, at best, I'm hoping this can leverage the fans of the vlogger and boobs genres and do some good at spreading the word.\nTLDR: What is Bitcoin? Again.
