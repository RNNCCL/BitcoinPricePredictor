I appreciate that a lot of money and effort is going into this (comparatively speaking) but if you compare this to the datacenters that are built to support financial services, it\'s so staggeringly substandard that it\'s comical. If the bitcoin industry is to be successful in the long run, we need to step it up from amateur hour datacenter build philosophies and put our big boy pants on.\n\nNow I know a lot of people are married to the idea of having a raised floor in a datacenter, otherwise it\'s not a datacenter. I think we are past that notion being the standard, however, and building a datacenter on slab is perfectly acceptable and a lot of big players build on slab - so as far as that goes I think you\'re fine. What isn\'t illustrated here, however, is the method of heat rejection (which most people call "cooling"). You say you have hot aisle/cold aisle configuration but that is a lot different from hot aisle/cold aisle *containment*. HA/CA containment separates the air streams from each other such that the hot air doesn\'t get fed directly back into the supply for the cold(er) air feeding the racks. You lose that in this hardware-on-a-shelf scenario - and whereas the facility itself may pass fire inspection, I would be very skeptical about its ability to maintain the environmental conditions within acceptable limits. You show the inside of the datacenter - but what do you have externally to actually reject the heat? If you\'re simply using outside air to feed the datacenter and push hot air out, you introduce a lot more complexity to the equation (pollutants, dust, humidity, condensation, etc). This is why [ASHRAE TC 9.9](http://tc99.ashraetcs.org/) exists. Many industry leaders push the limits (and go beyond) the TC 9.9 guidelines but they can afford to because they do things like HA/CA containment or treat them as test environments (and just generally have exceptional engineering teams at their disposal).\n\nYou show "vents" but as best as I can tell they are at the perimeter of the room and this is NOT an ideal scenario for the way the ~~racks~~ shelves are laid out. Typically, if you use perimeter cooling, at the very least you blow the air parallel to the aisles such that it goes from both sides into the cold aisles and the return air somewhat naturally comes back overhead from the hot aisles. Also, how is the air supply balanced? Best as I can tell it\'s simply a supply header with some ducts along the way to distribute the air.\n\nGarage door straight into the datacenter? I\'m pretty sure most people would expect some higher security for money-generating machines but maybe my standards are too high.\n\nLet\'s move beyond the construction, if you want to call it that. How about operations? All of the power / cooling equipment? How do you plan to manage the preventive and corrective maintenance of that to ensure that the equipment stays on and minimize downtime? How about corrective maintenance when something breaks? My guess is you have a "fix it when it breaks" approach and probably don\'t have concurrent maintainability or even any type of real power / cooling redundancy.\n\nAnyway, for anyone in the datacenter world, this would be far from boast-worthy. From what I have seen and have been able to discern from the photos that *have* been shared, I would not associate myself with this type of build even in the slightest.\n\nGood luck with your venture, however - and double good luck to any customers that decide to pull the trigger here.': 7, 'Datacenter should be "container-based data centers" ( http://www.neowin.net/images/uploaded/Microsoft_DC1.jpg ) ... if the electricity get to expensive ..

It\renables users to make secure and quasi-anonymous payments. Although many users value the private nature of bitcoin, some government officials seem to be concerned. Specifically, they note that bitcoin\rmight facilitate illicit transactions and disrupt government activities like conducting monetary policy and\rraising revenues. For these reasons, some governments have attempted to ban or discourage the use of\rbitcoin.\r\nWe have considered the extent to which these government efforts might be successful. In the existing\rliterature, similar considerations have been made by employing random matching models. However, the\rrandom matching protocol is not well suited for questions of monetary competition and control. Our\rmodel, in contrast, endogenizes the matching process: an agent preferring to transact with bitcoin might\ravoid those holding the currency favored by government. This means that, except in the case where all\rbitcoin is held by the government, some transactions are effectively (though only probabilistically) beyond\r\nthe reach of the state.\r\nEmploying a monetary model with endogenous search and random consumption preferences, we\rfind that the government\xe2\x80\x99s refusal to accept bitcoin is not typically sufficient to prevent their acceptance\rin equilibrium. The government must be of a particular size to prevent the circulation of bitcoin and\rthe size threshold depends crucially on the fraction of agents willing to accept currency. Interestingly,\r\nour work suggests that bitcoin might continue on as a niche money, even if the government proactively\rdiscourages its use, so long as some individuals are sufficiently committed to accepting bitcoin.': 1, 'Link: http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2531518': 1, "'Niche money' is the worst possible case scenario if governments try to restrict its use or ban it.

I mined with these for 6 months on leased ghs before getting my antminers, so have seen them adapt over the last months': 1}, ('ELI5: How does more hash power make the bitcoin network more secure?', 6): {'The more hash power the network has, the more hash power  is required to manipulate the blockchain.': 10, 'Ok here\'s the basics on how hash rate secures the network.\n\nFirst a little background/set up.  Each block is a list of transaction combined using a [merkle tree](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree). This ensures that every transaction is permanently secured into the block using a [hash](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function) and can not be altered.  A merkle tree has a "top hash" that is combined with a numerical [Nonce](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_nonce) (a one time use number that is incremented to change the hash in the next step).  \n\nThis is where the process commonly called mining (or "Proof of Work") begins.  The header (nonce + top hash + previous block hash & incidental data) is then repetitively hashed, while incrementing the nonce to created different results each attempt, until it satisfies requirements of difficulty.  You can think of difficulty as requiring X number of zeros at the front of the hash to satisfy the proof of work requirement.  Due to the uniqueness of the header and randomness of sha256 hashing, this hashing overall guarantees that, on average, you will have to perform the required amount of effort to create a block acceptable by the network.  The network regulates the difficulty in order to target a block every 600 seconds (10 minutes).  This insures that the release schedule of the 21 million bitcoins happens as outlined by Satoshi.  This is a basic "Fly By" of how mining/network works.\n\n***Ok, with that bit of background, lets talk about how the hash rate secures the network.***  Since difficulty guarantees that you must do certain amount of hashes (on average) to get a block accepted by the network,  it requires that a certain amount of hashing power to control the network, due to the time frame (600 seconds) before the network solves it.  This creates a race between all the miners.  The race happens because of the way consensus on the network works.\n\nThe "official" version of the block chain is longest version, that\'s how we determine who wins a block, if two blocks are submitted at the same time.  The winning chain in the P2P network is the one that meets all the requirements (hash, difficulty, valid transactions, etc) and is the longest.  To be the longest, the chain that is adopted, obviously, has to be built faster than any other competing chains on the network.\n\nAll that being said,  a bad actor would have to have more power and be able to create valid blocks faster than the rest of the network (commonly referred to as a "51% attack").  The more powerful the network is the more cost prohibitive this becomes.   As of this moment, the network runs at 264,807,622 gh/s.  If you were able to somehow get enough asics at, for the sake of discussion, lets say $0.50 a gh, it would cost about 132 million USD to do the attack.  This cost barrier protects the network from attack. \n\nNot only would you have to take the network over, but find a way to profit from it in a negative way.  This is essentially why the hashing power is said to secure the network.\n\nThere\'s a lot more detail to this, but my best effort to concisely explain why gh/s secures the network.\n\n\nEdit: feel free to ask if you want me to elaborate on any of this or have another question\n': 3, 'You, sir, have no idea how the network works.': 2, 'Individual power miners mine a smaller portion of the blocks, reducing their ability to defraud or attack the network.': 3, "your nonsensical response warrants no rebuttal.
