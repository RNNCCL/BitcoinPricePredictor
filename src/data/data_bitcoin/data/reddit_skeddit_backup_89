If billions of people are solo-mining, we'll need to record billions of transactions per day just to record their mining contributions.

So this way you'll make botnets profitable, that's not good.\n\nGPU mining is less problematic, but advantages over ASIC mining aren't quite clear. It will let some gamers to use their existing GPUs.

Satoshi had to ask people to voluntarily not use GPU mining because it was already very unbalancing.\n\n> What we have instead, and scarily similar to the world government economy a lot of us are trying to escape from, is a small number of wealthy individuals who have complete power over the rest of the world, and whose fortune is increasing because of their existing stranglehold.\n\nBitcoin isn't intended to decentralize influence, that's not possible.

If the miners all voted 100% to increase the coin limit to 42 million, the result of that vote would be nothing, people don't have to go along with what miners vote.\n\n> Bitcoin COULD be totally free of fees if everyday spenders subsidised them via simply running a miner in the background and increasing their electricity cost insignificantly\n\nNothing stops you from running a miner already.

But software to create decentralized pools (p2pool) is already here and slowly getting better (it will require commoditization of ASICs to really work though)\n2. Mining is setup by manufacturers. But over time they will compete with each other until they can no longer be vertically integrated, because manufacturers will make more money focusing on their areas of expertise rather than trying to do everything \n\nThere are also constant efforts to find a more democratizing proof of work, something that resists centralized advantage.

If you have multiple consensus implementations you can actually detect a hardfork and pause business until manual resolution, making the software more safe against hardforks, not less.

If that is the case, then that defeats the purpose of the Payment Protocol - as the customer should not be required to handle any bitcoin addresses. \n\nThe e-mail channel is not invalid. The Payment Request message is expected to be signed using the merchant's X.509's private key (the same one used for SSL sessions). The customer's wallet can verify that the signature for the Payment Request message matches the merchant's X.509 certificate's public key. This means it does not matter what channel the Payment Request message is sent - as the customer should always be able to verify the sender's identity (in this case, a domain name such as Amazom.com, or Bitpay.com).

The alternative was to have the user sign the message using the private key of the refund address to prove ownership.\n\nNope. If anything fishy comes of it, Bitpay has proof that you initiated the payment which caused the refund... you don\'t have "plausible deniability" here.\n\nI really can\'t understand what they\'re trying to do here...\n\nresearchers with too much free time on their hands most likely.': 2, 'Unfortunately, while a structured memo can help, it still does not solve the problem. \n\nOne example is the Marketplace Trader attack - the attacker can register with the trusted third party using the same details the customer provides to them, and then the victim will get the memo they are expecting. Once the customer has sent the payment (which the attacker can detect, as they have a copy of the Payment Request message) - they can then e-mail the merchant for a refund. \n\nAlso, the Payment Request, should not be limited based on the website the user is currently on. For example, this request can be sent via e-mail to the customer, who can then open it at their leisure to make the payment. What the research highlights - is that the merchant should have auditable evidence that the refund address received - has actually been endorsed by the same customer that authorised the payment. ': 1, 'The problem is that BitPay do not have proof that the customer initiated the payment and that the refund address sent at the time of payment *actually* belongs to the customer. Customers using the refund address to sign a message still does not prove it belongs to them, as there is no connection between payment and refund address. So the authors recommend that the merchants are provided with this evidence - that can link the payment and refund addresses together - to publicly demonstrate (or at least to an auditor) that they faithfully followed the protocol. Today, they cannot prove they honestly followed it. \n\nThe Marketplace Trader attack problem is to do with refund policies - so an rogue trader can set up a fake website, entice you into sending a payment using the reputation of a trusted third party, and then claim the bitcoins from the trusted third party. (i.e. they say they are working with Amazon, and you trust Amazon, you pay Amazon, and then they get your bitcoins). \n\n': 1, '> and then the victim will get the memo they are expecting\n\nThe victims wallet could simply see that the domain serving the payment request and the domain indicated by the payment request do not match, and simply decline to show it to the user.\n\nLikewise, fields in the memo would be wrong or  missing, and make it generally invalid. (if it was structured) For example, if it indicated the refund address, then the wallet would insist that it is the expected one before showing the request to the user.\n\n> For example, this request can be sent via e-mail to the customer, who can then open it at their leisure to make the payment.\n\nThis is invalid unless the email channel is secured in some way, so that the recipient can tell who sent it to them. Email by default does not include this.': 1, 'Nice analysis -- agreed!': 2, 'Nothing much of value comes from the "research" except possible the suggestion that payment protocol clients should obviously not present the user with a payment request that seems to come from a different site that the one the customer is on.\n\nSecondly the memo field should be well structured, indicating what is being bought ad where it is being shipped to. It was a mistake to leave the memo field both unstructured and unspecified, because then the user\'s agent has no reliable method to present the memo to the user a structured manifest of what is being bought, where it will be shipped to, terms of refund or cancellation, exodus/refund addresses upon overpayment etc. Perhaps even more importantly, and invoice ID. A structured receipt would be far more useful, imo.\n\nThe suggestion in the paper to countersign refund addresses is negative. The user might not be able to do that, since they may be send via a third party. They may also not own the refund address. \nHowever, if the refund address was included in the original order request, then it could be in a structured memo field, and thus give the user a chance to agree to it before paying.\n\nSo yes the payment protocol could be improved, but none of the weaknesses described in the paper are real weaknesses.': 2}, ('No, Brian Armstrong, the bitcoin price uptrend Is not happening because likelihood of Hard Fork is increasing, rather the COMPLETE OPPOSITE!', 1): {'The only time I have ever been worried about the future of bitcoin was when all the xt stuff started being talked about.': 0, 'Jesus Christ, when will these guys learn.\n\nYou have bitcoinocracy, consistent price drops after HF milestones and classic announcements...': 5, "I assume Brian expects his company will benefit if there's a hard fork.

By entering a work contract, you sell your hours or the work done for a rate of your choosing. Then you get paid in chunks of time because every payment has to be verified by the human (because employer wants to have some control over this and verify that the work was indeed done).\n\nWhat would be the improvement in the system you\'re proposing? You\'re just adding another unit (LaborCoin) to be converted to (and from), but it\'s just a unit for expressing how much your hour is worth. You can get that at any time today by simply dividing your paycheck by the number of hours you work for it. You can do this by the minute if you wish.\n\nYou can\'t account for your time in blockchain; or to be more precise, you can record it , but that involves extra manual work with no decentralization benefits. Typically accounting for time worked is done by the hour because shorter units of time simply take too much administration on the part of employee (which is billed as well) and employees don\'t typically want to verify each minute of your time as it eats their time as well. So recording it in blockchain doesn\'t mean much unless this record is "signed" by both employee and employer. Which is implicitly done in typical paycheck already. Third party (miner) has no way to verify this lest he does some sort of audit which is again expensive and not done automatically.\n\nYou can pay for the services rendered (instead of for the time done) and verify delivery in some way; this is the way smart contracts are going but it doesn\'t actually need whole new cryptocurrency.\n\nSo the question is, what\'s the improvement LaborCoins bring - I can\'t actually find any?': 1, 'Drunken Friday night ramblings ftw.\n\nLet\'s disrupt "employment"! :)': 6, "Hi,\n\nI've actually started a project similar to this called TimeVault.
