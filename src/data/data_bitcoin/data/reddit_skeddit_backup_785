This means it is not truly in your control as they could freeze it, run off with it, lose it to a hack etc. This may be unlikely given they have proven to be reliable and have a good reputation.\n\nFor larger amounts it starts to be a more difficult question and you need to ask if you want to accept these risks. Several online exchanges/wallets have failed spectacularly in the past and people have lost their coins.\n\nYou can have your own wallet(s) and transfer bitcoins easily from one to the other. Wallets located on your desktop system or mobile phone are also often at risk of hackers due to special virus/trojans/key loggers etc. But you take over full control and don\'t have risks of freezing or other whims of authority.\n\nMost knowledgeable users of Bitcoin will create an offline wallet for storing long term holdings. Since you don\'t need access every day it\'s not much hassle to move funds there. An offline wallet is one printed on paper or created and stored on a computer that has never been connected to the net. Many prefer BIP38 paper wallets and that\'s a great choice. I use Electrum on a Raspebrry Pi ($35) computer that doubles as my media centre (TV). By swapping it\'s SD card and disconnecting it becomes offline. There are many favourite ways people around here like to use. The Trezor device is another - being a small hardware wallet which stores funds securely without being net connected.\n\nIf you just have a few coins and want to learn more then go ahead and try out some of these ideas. But if you don\'t want to bother and it\'s a small amount then just leave them on Coinbase. One of the fun things you can play with is a mobile phone wallet like Mycellium. It even has a "Local trader" feature where you can buy/sell with people directly in your area. \n\nThere are many Bitcoin exchanges in various countries which people use to trade. The price of Bitcoin is entirely market based, like corn or soy beans, so varies based on supply and demand, and speculation is a major factor. The price is typically very volatile (moves up and down a lot), often having dull periods followed by explosions and then falls as the excitement wanes. Some like to trade, or gamble, play the game, but also many just hold and like to watch the whole thing mature and focus on the technology and where it\'s heading.': 1, "1) I would recommend using [electrum](https://electrum.org/) wallet if you are on PC.

And it continues because even if they get caught nobody goes to prison and the fines aren't even as high as the profits that were made. Anyone is a fool to trust a system so clearly crooked when it's trivial to buy real bitcoin.\n\nThat's even assuming there not some legal way in the rules to cheat. Maybe they don't really have to back the fund with bitcoin under some circumstances--who knows with the complexity of the documents. Nobody seems to know for sure how the gold etf actually interacts with real physical gold.

The one closest in concept to the Winklevoss bitcoin ETF is [SPDR Gold Shares](http://www.spdrgoldshares.com/), which trades on the NY Stock Exchange.  It simply holds a lot of gold in an [HSBC vault in London](http://www.spdrgoldshares.com/assets/static/GLD/image/dsc_0005_800.jpg).  The shares represent fractional ownership of the gold, and the share asset value and market price varies with the underlying price of gold.\n\nThe Winklevoss Trust will do a similar thing, except holding bitcoins instead of gold.  Each share of the fund will represent fractional ownership of the BTC in the fund, and the asset value and market price will vary with the underlying value of the coins.\n\nThe advantage for investors of an ETF is that non-ETF mutual fund shares can only be bought if your brokerage has an arrangement with the fund operator.  ETF shares can be bought if your brokerage is a member of the exchange.  Pretty much every brokerage belongs to the major exchanges, so more investors have access that way.': 6, "I'm not surprised that /r/bitcoin doesn't see the irony of a bitcoin ETF.

It\'s public key cryptography - you sign the transaction with your public key and everybody can see that the transaction is correct - they don\'t know your private key, but they can see from the public key, that the private key was used to sign the transaction.\n\nIf you can keep your private key(s) safe, nobody can steal your bitcoins. \n\n[Do you want to learn more?](http://en.bitcoin.it/)\n\n': 2, 'I understand, that has happened to me too.

Capitalism itself is such a broad term that you'd probably find there are as many definitions for capitalism as there are people. I wouldn't be surprised if most people gravitated towards a free-market/laissez fair definition as this is all that most people have been shown/told.\n\nFor me Bitcoin and crypto will have flourished when the discourse escapes the limiting understanding of human relations as a series of exchanges between atomised individuals for the purpose of maximising self interest.

Dead simple because no keys or transactions occur on the phone.

There's just so much to discover!\n\nMy absolute watching tip: [The real value of bitcoin and crypto currency technology](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIVAluSL9SU)": 3, "You can truly secure your bitcoins by following the following simple steps.\n\n * You simply cannot trust computer hardware manufacturers. Hardware Backdoor's are real and more prevalent than you can imagine. The only way to be sure you aren't susceptible is to design and build your own CPU and computer system. Fabricating your own silicon chips is a surprisingly simple process, as all you really need is some sand.\n\n * Once you've hand manufactured your CPU, Motherboard, RAM, and IO devices, you'll need to write a C compiler that will compile down to your CPU's native language. Writing your own compiler will keep you safe from the Ken Thompson Hack.\n\n * Create a simple OS that you can use to access the internet. Some people might suggest using Linux, but there are 9,868,933 lines of code in just the Kernel, most of which you won't need, and personally verifying every line for rootkits might take a bit longer than you have the patience for.\n\n * Create your own bitcoin client. Satoshi's client could possess hidden back doors, or they could have been introduced since his departure. The classic create-a-currency-to-compromise-a-users-computer-attack is devastating, and we can't rule Satoshi out. Bottom line is that you cannot be sure.\n\n * Dig a very deep hole into the earth, and surround it with at least three feet of re-enforced concrete. Place your custom PC in there. Thermal imaging attacks can easily penetrate the walls of your home, and reveal your private keys to any wayward onlooker, or high tech peeping tom. A sufficiently deep hole will also protect you against common keystroke sound vibration attacks. Also, if you've had any help so far, this hole will double as their grave. Loose ends are security holes.\n\n * Before generating your public private key pair, carefully run your hands over your head to ensure that you don't have any suspicious electrodes attached to your skull. Mind Reading technology is real.\n\n * Once your wallet is setup, Quantum Encrypt it so that any attempts to access it will immediately destroy the information.\n\n * This is the most important: Never leave your re-enforced hole in the ground. Leaving your hole makes you susceptible to the highly effective (despite what Bill O'Reilly would have you believe) water-boarding-private-key-extraction-attack.\n\nSource: [A long time computer security expert](http://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1e4b9s/the_only_truly_secure_way_to_use_bitcoin_from_a/)\n": 3, 'I use Electrum.
