(How many petahashes per billion $ of network value)', 0): {'The profit margin of mining is always very small, because the hash rate needed to mine adjusts dynamically to the overall hashing power of the network. That means, if one Bitcoin is worth one USD and mining a block will reward you with 25 bitcoins, over time miners will tend to use just shy of 25 USD of electricity and computing equipment per block. The higher the price per bitcoin, the more you can invest and still make a profit.\n\nThe cool thing about this is, with a rising price per bitcoin, the hash rate increases and makes the network more secure. More secure because an attack would be of a higher price to the attacker. If the price per bitcoin falls, so does the hashing power, but also the incentive to attack the network falls.\n\nImagine the two points on a spectrum. The left point is where the bitcoin network is used by two people only. It is very easy for one of them to overpower the other and take control over the network. A cheap GPU upgrade will make you the winner. But will you buy a 300 USD GPU just to mess with your buddy over some digital tokens nobody else uses anyway? It\'s not a high investment to attack that network, but it\'s still very expensive, because you gain nothing from the attack.\n\nThe right point is the network when bitcoin is the world reserve currency, having a value of lets say one bitcoin being the equivalent of a tenth of the GDP of a medium sized European country. Now controlling the network would be of much greater advantage for an attacker, but would need unbelievable amounts of capital to even attempt it and even then, if he succeeds, a simple patch can make his mining hardware obsolete after the first block that he mines and everybody on the planet who has meat in this game, which is everybody on the planet at this point in time, goes "wtf was that?"': 1, "The argument of the correlation of the price to attack and the value (=threat to the government in your example) of the network applies too, I think. Right now the US, Chinese, Russian or really any other government of big enough countries or productive enough people could pull off such a sabotage. Spend a billion and you could easily disturb the network with 51% attacks, malicious miners and nodes etc. And a billion is not that much for those governments. But right now, spending a billion USD to attack this, in their perception, nerd-money-ponzi-scheme is like the guy who thinks about buying a 300 USD GPU to overpower his buddy, the only other guy in the network. It makes no sense at all to do that. And at the point where the nerd-money-ponzi-scheme is actually absorbing the monetary base of country after country, it's not a billion USD to attack it anymore.\n\nAnd again: Even if you attack it, even if you don't care if you make a loss attacking it because it saves your fiat-money-fraud-system. So what? If you invest a billion USD in ASIC miners who do sha256 very fast and the rest of the network is threatened by you, the next version of bitcoin uses sha256 of the Whirlpool hash and suddenly the billion dollar ASIC farm is nothing more than an expensive electrical heater.

If someone wanted to undermine the network for whatever reason, to drive the price down or to decrease trust in bitcoin altogether, there are any number of attacks that could be launched.\n\n- Run miners that purposely leave out transactions to clog the network\n- Run miners that double spend\n- Run miners that fork the code\n- Legal attacks on mining operations\n- DOS attacks on miners / nodes\n- etc.........\n\nThese would all have some short/medium/long-term negative consequences for the network and judging the profitability of the attack depends on the cost of the attack and the benefit for the attacker...\n\nThere are many scenarios where an attack could be profitable (or would create a rational expectation of a profit). \n\nThe network is not so perfect as to make any attack theoretically and practically unprofitable in every possible scenario. \n\nEx: If a government views bitcoin as an existential threat, then an expenditure on an attack that hobbles bitcoin and protects the value of fiat (for X amount of time) could easily be seen to have a positive return on investment. \n\nMy initial thought was along the lines of, 'how expensive would it be to take control of a substantial portion of mining power, such that the attacker would have some market power to negatively affect BTC?' And specifically, what is the cost of the attack relative to the expected negative affect on BTC (as measured in price/total decrease in market cap). \n\ni.e. You would need to spend $200M on mining equipment and electricity in order to get control of 25% of the mining power, which would then allow you to do X... which would decrease the price by Y.\n\n\n\n\n": 1, 'Why does the number of hashes matter?

OK good... then bam, it turns out they weren\'t good."\n\nThe same exact attack could be done using rng by poisoning the rng... the only huge difference would be engineering a way to make the tests look like they\'re valid and following known vectors, but in actuality they just return true no matter what or some other way.\n\nBut to really sum up what I was saying:\n\nYou asked for "how could someone fuck up with RFC6979 and open themselves up to attack?" under the pretense of "there\'s no attack vectors" and I was just pointing to "what if the coder himself was the attacker and the victim, his colleagues, didn\'t know better?"

Today the value of bitcoin is about $210. I think the concept of intrinsic or 'true' value has been thoroughly debunked, but for the sake of argument we can say that no one knows for sure the true value, and that's why the price keeps on changing - the market is trying to figure it out.\n\nMy belief is that bitcoin has the *potential* to be valued much higher than today, which is why I buy them now, but I'm thinking long term; like 10 years.

': 2, 'The best way to think about this is to ask the question "What would it take to get bitcoin to $1000 **and keep it there**." This is because eventually mining will find equilibrium when the profit from mining approaches close to zero, or put another way when the cost of mining 1 bitcoin is 1 bitcoin. Since mining fees, like electricity, are typically denominated in fiat, this will be the number of coins that need to be bought up on the exchange every day to keep the price stable.\n\n* to keep the price *stable* at $1,000, new and existing users must purchase $3.6M USD worth of coins per day.\n* to keep the price *stable* at $10,000, new and existing users must purchase $36M USD worth of coins per day.\n\nWhen the halving day rolls around in about a year, the interesting part is that these numbers will halve. Over the past year, on average about $1.4M of bitcoin were bought up every day. The bitcoin userbase simply wasn\'t able to buy up all the new coins, and this is why the price has slid down slowly. If demand for bitcoin remains stagnant (the combined bitcoin economy can only afford about $1.4M/day to balance bitcoin inflation), then to zero\'th order the price of bitcoin will eventually double after the effects of the halving-day propagate through the economy.\n\nThe really interesting thing happens when 6 or 8 halving days have happened. In 24 to 32 years, even if the bitcoin economy is only capable of investing $1.4M/day, the price goes from $200 to $12,800 and $51,200 respectively.\n\nEach halving day, half of that $1.4M/day stops being diverted to mining, and can be allocated to buying us cars, houses, and food!': 28, "It's not only about people putting money in, it's also about people not wanting to cash out.

Also, many orders are placed off the books on third party platforms and execute as market orders when the price hits the trigger. So you can never know all the limit orders by just looking at an exchange's order books. \n\nI suppose if you had an incredibly rich data set you could correlate past price movements with how orders moved in response, then apply that to a change in price levels in the future. I doubt it would tell you much though.\n\nIn terms of probability, market sentiment is not that predictable and is much more important than a snapshot of an order book when looking at a far-off price point.
