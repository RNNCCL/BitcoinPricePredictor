Let\'s assume this is one of the most fatal ones imaginable: anyone with knowledge of the public key can trivially find the private key. Any coins sent to a public key, or to an address that has also spent or signed anything are now compromised. The only uncompromised coins are ones sent to an address that has not spent yet. (if we assume that SHA-256 and RIPEMD-160 are also broken along with the elliptic curve crypto, then even these coins are compromised, along with the mining process, and it\'s all over - start a new coin from scratch with all new algorithms)\n\nThe ultimate broken-crypto "game over" scenario is where every output on the blockchain is compromised. Anything less than that *might* be recoverable.\n\nLet\'s say that you patch the code so that there\'s a new, secure crypto with different addresses, and you can send from old broken-crypto addresses to the new ones.\n\nWhen you broadcast a transaction, you must include your public key and signature authorizing the transaction. If you publicly broadcast a transaction, any node can replace your transaction with one spending the coins to their own address, and there\'s no way to tell who the rightful owner of the key is. The only way to get your transaction to reliably enter the blockchain is by mining it yourself, or sending it to trusted miner(s) and having them mine it. (holding some secure coins in escrow could be enough to make this work with minimal trust of the miner: if they replace it with their own transaction, you get the coins from the escrow instead) If your coins were valuable enough to attract attention, you might have to worry that a dishonest and powerful-enough miner will attempt to \'rewind\' the blockchain and spend your coins to their own address (and then make that chain the longest). This means that a 51% attack now has the potential to steal many coins.\n\nAnother way I just thought of to help is to implement something like what Namecoin has to prevent people stealing a domain right when you want it: It should be possible to implement some sort of "proof of unbroadcast transaction", that has to enter the blockchain x blocks (e.g. 6 or 144) before you broadcast your transaction. Then when the time is up, you broadcast your transaction, and everyone checks that the txid was in an earlier proof before accepting it: that way, it doesn\'t matter that the private key is now public information.\n\nSo actually, I guess you\'re kind of right: even totally broken crypto can be recovered from without totally resetting the blockchain, but much more painfully than "push out a patch, it\'ll all be alright".': 1, 'Meteor hits the earth, instantly vaporizing all humans.': 1, 'I believe there is enough legal precident for bitcoin at this point that if a rollback like this was to occure, traditional means to complete settlement or some equivalent resolution could be used.

Start a new coin with better cryptography.\n\nIf only one person knew the vulnerability and did something blatantly obvious like stealing all bitcoins where the public key is known (note that many are locked up in addresses where the public key is *not* known until you spend from that address, so at best the attacker could wait until a legitimate transaction is broadcast from that address, and then issue a double-spend transaction where he also tries to spend the coins), Bitcoin would likely drop to $0.  \nBut if he were more discreet, he could steal coins without people noticing.\n\n>The second is a code fail, allowing someone to spend other people's coins without knowing their private key, for example. \n\nThis would be fixed with a patch in short order, and wouldn't have to kill Bitcoin.": 1, 'There was one cryptocurrency which distributed its tokens to people that were existing holders of Bitcoin, Dogecoin, and Litecoin.\n\nEveryone already owns that cryptocurrency, whether they know it or not, and the concept they used is a cool algorithmic kind of a 1:1 mapping.': 1, 'All humans die from a rogue asteroid impacting the Earth': 1, 'It really is lucky it happened so early before many people were looking, it really was a terrible one two punch since "what if someone just hacked themselves a bunch of bitcoin" is a constant fear and supposed to be impossible and the concept of a rollback like that is just anathema for it being seen as even remotely trustworthy.

Analysts and investors analyze these fundamentals to develop an estimate as to whether the underlying asset is considered a worthwhile investment. ](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fundamentals.asp) Ed: the highlight in bold is the important bit we need to focus on.\n\nSo, Bitcoin is not company, security, or currency. It is in essence a time stamping network that tracks the ownership of values over time, that being information, it is not strictly a currency per se but we DO attribute to that information *value* though, those little numbers that represent bitcoins represent an inviolable piece of information on the network. This means you need to think hard about the kinds of qualitative, and quantitative pieces of information that will aid Bitcoin's economic health, and will adversely impact on Bitcoin's economic health. How these things balance out will determine it's economic utility in the world's markets and how this will increase it's value (as demand outstrips supply), or cause it to lose value (as supply eclipses demand).\n\nLet me throw out some metrics that may apply qualitatively and quantitatively to Bitcoin's economic value that would make people consider it more worthwhile as an investment or not, or in other words, what would make people use it or not.\n\n* Bugs in the codebase. Edit: The stability of the code, and the security of the code is paramount, if Bitcoin is not a solid codebase, it will be all for naught. Also other implementations of the codebase in different languages and by different developers helps to verify it's functionality and help stabilise and reveal hard to find bugs, it's also a strong sign that Bitcoin is not a stagnant with is a strong sign that there is a need on the community for the codebase to grow, to be more functional, stable, robust, etc.\n\n* Merchant adoption.\n\n* Exchanges/brokers, whether that be number of them, reputation of them, the amount of access they have to Bitcoins and fiat at any one time (liquidity), users trading (both the number of users and the number of trades), etc.\n\n* Innovation, this means access to, and freedom to innovate using the Bitcoin network (IOW do developers care? And if they do, are they interested in making Bitcoin derived software), the ease with which people are able to innovate using bitcoin means that more facilities, products, and exposure is possible too.\n\n* Investment money (VC money) in businesses that utilise Bitcoin for whatever reason. This speeds up innovation and concentrates on specialised products on the blockchain that are geared towardss generating revenue and more economic activity. If VC, or money from other areas are being spent on Bitcoin, it will grease the wheels of innovation significantly.\n\n* Legality, the legality of Bitcoin in countries around the world will have a significant impact on whether merchants decide to use it or not, and this will have a knock-on effect to other areas of the Bitcoin space as it will affect demand and lowere the level of constant commerce that Bitcoin will eventually depend on in the long term. \n\n* Mining, are miners still mining? How is the hashrate? The hash rate is integral to Bitcoin's security model. Knowing whether miners are still staying around, and have long term plans to keep mining is something that is definitely going to affect the security of the blockchain and every transaction that underlies it, if it drops precipitously, this could endanger future transaction reliability and such so knowing that miners are diverse, acting in a sustainable way, and have plans to keep mining into the future is important to know.\n\n* Network activity: This ones a bit nebulous though as it can be subject to manipulation so it's important to be wary when taking these at their face value. Bitcoin stats like the number of full nodes, mining pool/operations and their hashrates, number of transactions over time, days destroyed for coins, transactions fees and where we are with the block reward should be taken into consideration. I personally wouldn't put a huge amount of faith in these numbers though as they can be unreliable and I feel they poorly reflect what is actually happening in the Bitcoin ecosystem, so I personally keep my salty shaker handy when looking at these numbers (much like I do with the price).\n\nWhen anyone talks about the fundamentals, these are things you should keep in mind OP, they don't all need to be going vertical to mean that Bitcoin is going to succeed, but if you want a solid set of fundamentals with regards to Bitcoin, I think this is a fairly solid list to measure it against.

Specifically, **people will desire to hold a certain *real value* in money. Since supply is fixed, that value is achieved by adjustments in the price level (the exchange rate between real goods & services and money).**\n\nExample: each citizen wishes to hold 10% of the value of his real assets (i.e. house, car) in a super liquid financial instrument (money) so that he can cover immediate expenses. If the total supply of money (in units) is equal to the total supply of real goods (in units) you would expect the exchange rate to be 10:1 money to goods (price = 10 monetary units per real unit), which will mean that society, and thus each individual holds the desired 10% of real value in money.': 1, 'Yes, a lot of people get lost in complexities, but it is really that simple:\n\nScarcity + utility = value.': 6, 'What are the fundamentals of Larry and Sergey working in a Menlo Park garage?\n\nReplace Larry and Sergey with "total nobodies" and that\'s pretty much Bitcoin.': 1, 'Those transistor enthusiasts were a bunch of cultists as well I suppose.': 0, 'scarcity and utility... the end': 12, 'Can you see the future?

Let us say that there is a currently existing altcoin such that today it is less used than bitcoin, `M_a(today) < M_b(today)` but in the far future it will be more adopted i.e., `M_a(far) > M_b(far)`. Because of the "instability" argument exposed above, this actually implies that `M_a(far) >> M_b(far)`.\n\nThis does not necessarily imply that *there can be only one*, as future coins could appear. But in any case it means that `M_b` would be at the *failure scenario*.\n\nHowever, if Bitcoin has failed against an altcoin, this implies that this particular altcoin can fail against any newer competitor. If Bitcoin fails as a practical store of value, no altcoin would be seen as a safe store of value. This necessarily implies that both `M_a` and `M_b`in the far future would be smaller than today.
