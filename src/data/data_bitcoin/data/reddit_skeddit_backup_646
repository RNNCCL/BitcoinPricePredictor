It takes a sample size from the last several trades to draw the line at its current point. \n\nIn the sample it looks for the closing point between the high and lows. If the closing point is at the top for most of the trades it will be near 100, at the bottom it will be near 0. \n\nThis gives an idea of overbought, or oversold. Usually viewed as over 80 it was quickly overbought, below 20 oversold.\n\n There are different scales that can be used that can show fast or slow swings. Sometimes you'll need to ignore it floored to the top or bottom for a bit before the reversal happens. \n\nYou can actually see it change direction sometimes before the price does.\n\nOn these images the high point was getting progressively lower drawing a slant across the top. Being near the bottom it's saying that we are going to go up again. We will either see another cycle of the to slant down and to the right, another wave in price, up one down two or a complete reversal on price, a run up.\n\nUsually I see the price waves have three distinguishable waves then sideways movement, making a fourth or fifth smaller wave. 3-5 is average, 7-11 happens.\n\nThe price waves\n\nDon't follow the price very detailed, look at how it starts high and slopes down, wave 1, then it goes up and slopes down, wave 2, goes up slopes down, wave 3. Each wave getting smaller, weaker.\n\nYou can see the waves better looking at the macd, the one above the stochastic oscillator. Notice the highs of each wave decreasing in altitude. The white marks in the middle, the histogram, show the distance between the red and blue lines, it gets smaller each wave suggesting pattern/trend is weakening.\n\nThe RSI is relative strength index. I can't explain this as well but the way I see it is I view it from the middle, 50%. Above it is how much strength is pushing the price up against resistance, below it how much strength is pushing it down against resistance. It has a pattern that also looks like a bouncing ball getting lower and lower.\n\nThe way to view this all together is that we have a distinguishable pattern that is getting lower and weaker according to macd, the strength is down right now and so will bounce up again, then down while we are near reversal of price, stochastic oscillator being near bottom. The main guess lies in how many more waves we have before we are done with the downward waves. Looking at 3,5,15 minute scales you can see this bear pattern, then it moves sideways in tiny waves before we get either more bear patterns or switch to bull patterns.\n\nAn idea of bear/bull patterns.

The actual owner of the deed, person X, remains the owner of the property, in the absence of any other contract stating otherwise.\n\nIn other words, colored coins are not replacements for deeds, they are amendments to them.\n\nEdit: IANAL, this was off the top of my head.': 1, 'Or, what happens if a hacker gets the private key to the deed to your house?\n\nThe problem is that knowing the private key to a blockchain address (like holding the physical key of a house) gives only *possession* of its contents, not *property*.  \n\nA thing is your property if, and only if, the government thinks that you should have possession of it, and will use its police and law mechanisms to put you back in its possession, if someone else takes possession of it.  \n\nIn democratic regimes, there are laws  that define when a thing becomes your property, and when it ceases to be.

In principle, you are entitled to get some help from the government\' to try to get them back.
