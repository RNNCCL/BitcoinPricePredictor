You open the newspaper to an article on some subject you know well. In Murray\xe2\x80\x99s case, physics. In mine, show business.

You are in the business of selling bitcoins I presume?': 1, "Let's say you're downloading a movie.  Your torrent software is trying to calculate how long it will take to download.  You start at 1 kbps, then go to 2 kps, then go to 4 kps, then 8 kps, 16 kps, etc, etc.  Your speed is doubling every interval, and will continue to do so for a long long time.  \n\nHow does this affect the time to download calculation?  If you are *only* looking at the proportional component (which the Bitcoin protocol does), the formula says 'ok, we started at 1 kbps, now we're at 2 kbps, obviously we're averaging 1.5 kbps!'\n\nBut, that logic is invalid, because we're still accelerating our download speed.  The reality is, we're now at 3 kbps, and will continue to grow.  Our estimate is now off by a factor of 2.  Because of the way the download rate calculation is programmed, it will always show a longer time than actual, until you either stop accelerating or slow down.  This also explains why estimated download times always start at several weeks, then slowly reduce until the prediction shows just a few minutes/seconds.  \n\nThis is known as proportional control.  It only looks at past data to make a future prediction and does not take into consideration future trends or how long it has been under/over estimating it's predictions.  A good PID loop will look at proportional, integral and derivative components, but that gets out of the ELI5.  \n\nBitcoin works in a similar fashion, which is why we saw a long stretch of average reward times at 7 minute intervals in lieu of the designed 10 minute intervals.  The protocol looked at the average hash rate of the past X days, and adjusted difficulty based on that data.  However, the current hash rate far exceeded the past X days average because it was accelerating in growth, and thus block rewards were happening much quicker than 1 per 10 minutes.  \n\nIf we decelerate hash speed, the opposite will occur.  Block rewards will slow to one per 12+ minutes (which is why sometimes a movie will say it will only take 2 minutes to download, then jump up to 3 minutes) OR, if hash rate remains even, we'll see reward rates hitting the 10 minute mark as it was designed to do.  \n\n*If* miners are liquidating all their BTC to pay for energy consumption and hardware expenses, then drops or flatlines in the difficulty adjustment will slow their ability to liquidate.  \n\n\n\n\n\n": 4, 'Remindme! 2 months': 1, "We haven't hit any silicon limits wrt Bitcoin.

If we see that price and difficulty diverges over a long period of time, we know at least one of them must be wrong. My analysis what this means in practice is that the volatility of the bitcoin price will continue to decrease.

I see no driving force behind an exponential growth unless the price increases and then there's still the problem of the mining bonus halving. The margins seems to be very slim now so any large investment now has a long ROI so it seems like they need to start factoring that in now. It all hinges on the bitcoin price. As long as it remains stagnant, there's no real incentive to exponentially increase hashing power. The value of those 25 coins they get needs to exceed the value of the electricity they use. It seems like the miners fee on transactions will soon need to increase.\n\nA rough estimate is that each transaction cost 10-25 USD in electricity. That's based on an estimated total power consumption of 250 MW for the total network. Currently, those 10-25 dollars are not paid by the ones doing the transaction but by the ones buying the newly mined coins. \n\nSo everything depends on the price of a bitcoin.
