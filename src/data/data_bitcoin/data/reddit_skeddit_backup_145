Eventually, however, the cost will be driven down to zero profit by millions of business running their own nodes (once ASICs reach an efficiency plateau) and/or many devices (anything that plugs into a power socket) have a 21inc (or equivalent) mining chip built in and operating at a small loss or no-better-than-break-even.\n\nDevelopment may be a bit centralized, but there are a lot of developers working on Bitcoin already.

The second is to either remove the benefit of centralization.\n\nWith mining centralization\n\n1. We need increased independent verification of miners' work. When miners are independently validated, this limits the amount of damage they can do if they are corrupted from their intended purpose. The more independent validation, the less damage.\n2. We need to lower the barriers to entry of being a miner. The fewer barriers to entry the better. Currently miners face tons of barriers to compete effectively: they need tons of capital, they need powerful servers to withstand DDOS attacks, they need cheap electricity, good networking etc. The more of those barriers we can knock down, the lower the benefit of centralization, the more decentralized things will be\n\nWith development centralization\n\n1. We need more developers and independent peer review of the existing developers. When all development is done in the clear light of day and everything is carefully scrutinized, analyzed and tested, the number of attacks that are possible by a single developer or a coalition of developers is limited.\n2. We need to reduce the burden of Core and make it more modular. In the beginning Core was all powerful, it was everyone's wallet and it was everyone's miner and it was everyone's verifier. This made it hard to improve, so these functions started to split up, that's why we have many wallets now for example. A better design would be interlocking modules of responsibility, this will give developers more of a chance to contribute. To accomplish this, we need more development on Core to help restructure the internal components and build various native libraries so that the breadth of the project can be expanded and not bottlenecked on the efforts of a single team.\n": 6, 'There is no centralisation in development.

Point your Bitcoin client and Armory to their respective folders (you can write a quick bash script to do that for you) and all operations from there on will not differ from using Armory over the clearnet, i.e. you still need to update your blockchain data and let Armory catch up with its own db.\n\n- Setting up the offline machine is much simpler and you should consider only using live for that part.': 1}, ("Visual Capitalist - It's Official: Bitcoin was the Top Performing Currency of 2015", 17): {'Is it fair to call bitcoin currency or even compare it to the dollar?': 1}, ('bitcoin price increase?', 3): {'Thanks this is very interesting and partially the reason why I came over to this sub!

Usually these are poorly configured and managed protocols that enable the attacker to amplify the traffic they send. For example, a NTP server can be used because you can send it a small packet and it will return a packet about 80 times larger containing the requested information. If you do this with a large number of things it will amplify your traffic and send it to the target. Also, these services usually have to be on an ISP that is not taking the proper precautions to prevent host address spoofing. The attacker forms packets that look like they come from the target, so these services send the amplified response to the target instead of back at the attacker.\n\nSecuring your devices and protocols would do much to mitigate if not eliminate these issues.
