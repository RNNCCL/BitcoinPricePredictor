Now I'm not ignorant to the fact other means may be necessary to specific crime issues but they can be deal with with the proper specialty details. \n\nIf we are administering our services effectively realistically many of the quality of life issues that are most glaring in communities (pot holes, code issues, garbage issue, certain crime) should be seen and deal with in a timely manner without a string of constituent complaints.

It can also be used between people next to you, the point is that it can be used by anyone.\n\nSince it works faster than checks, bank transfers, wires, and is also cheaper to use, then some places (like the city of Troy) is looking into accepting it as a payment option. \n\nIt is easily convertible to and from US dollars, so people are using the bitcoin infrastructure to move US dollar value very quickly, anywhere in the world, without getting banks involved.\n\n": 2, 'Please look at the bitlicense and work on removing ben lawskys position from existing.

If bitcoin does reach mass adoption, the price will have to be orders of magnitude higher to support so many people using bitcoin. In that respect, the price now will be almost negligible. Compared to the hypothetical date of mass adoption, bitcoin is almost free now, and anyone who wants to buy a few bits can do so. Those with lots now will sell at the right price. Sure, it's risky to buy now hoping it'll be more in demand later. Therefore only some will do so. This is what will cause the inequality later (and has up until this point).

To quote from the original paper defining the B.G.P.: \xe2\x80\x9c[Imagine] a group of generals of the Byzantine army camped with their troops around an enemy city. Communicating only by messenger, the generals must agree upon a common battle plan. However, one or more of them may be traitors who will try to confuse the others. The problem is to find an algorithm to ensure that the loyal generals will reach agreement.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nMore generally, the B.G.P. poses the question of how to establish trust between otherwise unrelated parties over an untrusted network like the Internet.\n\nThe practical consequence of solving this problem is that Bitcoin gives us, for the first time, a way for one Internet user to transfer a unique piece of digital property to another Internet user, such that the transfer is guaranteed to be safe and secure, everyone knows that the transfer has taken place, and nobody can challenge the legitimacy of the transfer. The consequences of this breakthrough are hard to overstate.\n\nWhat kinds of digital property might be transferred in this way? Think about digital signatures, digital contracts, digital keys (to physical locks, or to online lockers), digital ownership of physical assets such as cars and houses, digital stocks and bonds \xe2\x80\xa6 and digital money.\n\nAll these are exchanged through a distributed network of trust that does not require or rely upon a central intermediary like a bank or broker. And all in a way where only the owner of an asset can send it, only the intended recipient can receive it, the asset can only exist in one place at a time, and everyone can validate transactions and ownership of all assets anytime they want.\n': 1, 'How did the bitcoiner get on the sex offenders registry?\nHe touched a miner.': 2, 'There\'s a lot of hype regarding Bitcoin\'s potential impact on developing economies, and it\'s sometimes hard to separate the idle daydreams from the workable visions.

An analogous topic to the blockchain is the healthiness or otherwise of low-carb diets. It\'s really, really inconvenient for the press and the medical industry when studies are published showing that fat is not bad for you (especially animal fat!), and that lower-carb/higher-fat diets improve markers such as cholesterol readings. So when the press publishes another "surprising" study it\'s not unusual to see things like "but experts say the long-term harm will outweigh any short-term benefits", without any justification for why this might be the case. Now, there is a vested interest in maintaining this public belief, because it is was ever conclusively proved and widely believed that high carb diets are dangerous, the agrobusinesses peddling crap made from cheap high fructose corn syrup, and the pharmaceuticals peddling diabetic medication and weight lost pills would go under. In the mean time they can make a lot of money by peddling similarly cheap, crap-filled "low carb" substitutes, and it will work all the while the general public is ignorant of human nutrition. If the general public educated themselves enough to choose healthy foods based on sound underlying nutritional principles this scam industry would collapse.\n\nSo it is (IMHO) with Bitcoin. There are definitely people with a vested interest in maintaining the opinion that Bitcoin has no value, but the explosion of press articles around "blockchain without the bitcoin" can be explained adequately by simple press ignorance parroting the same line without knowing how to challenge it. And by comparison, I don\'t think this will improve immediately until the general public educate themselves on sound economic principles, like (the one relevant to this article) the fact there is no such thing as intrinsic value.\n\nWhere I think it differs is that (based on my own personal observation), people are overall (this is a broad generalisation!) more interested in increasing their material wealth than maintaining their health. This can be explained simply because the feedback loop is much quicker \xe2\x80\x94 what you earn today you can spend tomorrow, but the health and fitness you work towards now takes a long time to produce a reward, and undoing it through an unhealthy lifestyle takes much longer to cause sickness.\n\nSo I don\'t think it matters. All these people chanting the mantra that Bitcoin has no intrinsic value won\'t change the fact that some people (these dumb idiots who think the ability to spend transaction outputs has any value! even though they\'re not backed by dollars! haha, fools) will act as if it does, and it will become a self-fulfilling prophecy.

Bitreserve mimics the blockchain traceability technology via what they call the Reservechain, while its feed of transactions with its users is called the Reserveledger. Both data sets can be downloaded from their [transparency page](https://bitreserve.org/en/transparency).": 1, 'Especially in Canada, eh?': 1, 'They are a Bitcoin company because they use Bitcoins underlying technology, many know it as blockchain technology. Mimicking Bitcoin and tying its tech to fiat currencies allows the cost of running Bitreserve vs traditional financial systems to fall so much that for the first time the scenerio of creating a bank without countless fees (transactions fees, currency conversion fees, transaction delay) and with transparency is practical. Before the blockchain existed, to do auditing of every transaction in real time and find a secure way to publish that information without compromising that database was extremely difficult, and doing so feelessly was near impossible. ': 1, 'I appreciate the link. I still do not get what "it" is, and what connection if any there is to Bitcoin. Is it a private ledger? Consensus? Who controls the nodes? thanks': 1, 'How does Bitreserve actually work? Their "How it works" page lacks the part about how it actually works.': 2, "Like a bank, they hold your value. However rather than issuing an insecure IOU with various fees and limitations attached, they hold your value denominated in various currencies/commodities of your choosing (creating liquidity in new assets), allow you to move this value frictionlessly (0% conversion/transaction fees) and instantly by way of bypassing traditional banking barriers, and always show a real-time proof of solvency of assets, creating a new standard of security that may riddle the banking industry with change - I hope. Traditional banking barriers which add fees and remove transparency have proven to work, obviously, as they provide accurate auditing of transaction and provide enough trust for the public. However, Bitreserve is on to something here as they are able to leapfrog other banks by offering the same service but with more transparency, less fees, less friction. I despise walking in to a bank to set up an new account, it's clear they want your money and more, and neglect your need of time. If I can find all, if not more, of the accuracy and security of tradition banks, while also paying less in fees, from the comfort of my own home, I am sold. ": 1, 'It = Bitreserve. The Reserveledger seems to be for off-chain transactions (value solely moved within their platform) and ties to the Bitcoin blockchain when using value from a Bitreserve account to send to a wallet outside of Bitreserves platform. Hopefully a rep from Bitreserve can chime in ': 1, "  'Hockey stick growth' I nominate this as technical term of the month.": 1}, ('Governments Are Using Bitcoin Account-Hacking Services', 9): {'The guys that hacked "the hacking team" sound surprisingly like anonymous.': 1, 'They aren\'t "hacking" bitcoin, they are using software to monitor bitcoin transactions on user computers.': 1}}}
