Each node can decide on its own to forward it or not.  'Proper' transactions will be forwarded.  Likewise, nodes that mine may include 'Proper' transactions in their next block.  A transaction is accepted as soon as it is in _thee_ blockchain.\n\nAll of that gets more complicated because the order of events is different for each node and _thee_ blockchain is not known until much later (even the six block confirmation is not 100% assured, but it is good enough).\n\nNow to answer your question.  A proper, pending transaction may dropped only if it is a double spend.  When you initially see a transaction, it is either the first of a double (or more) spend, the second.  If you see that it is the second, you know it is invalid and you will drop it/refuse payment.  If it is the first, there may be a second double spend transaction.\n\nThus you want to know, what are the chances there will be a second transaction (double spend) and what does it cost the crook to pull this off.  One way is for the crook to send out two transactions at the same time, but to different parts of the globe.  Then there is a 50/50 shot a minor across the globe will take the 'other' transaction as the 'first' one.  If you wait a bit, you'll see the second transaction get issues and you can refuse payment.  The time for a transaction to saturate the network is within 10 seconds.\n\nIf the crook has his own mining operation, he does not have to publish the second transaction and can attempt to mine it him/herself.

I bought in loyally after having hardware miners from them, and began when hashlets were released.  I\'ve made about 20% ROI to date, because I thought the "you\'re supposed to trade and sell the miners themselves" route of making ROI was specious at best.  \n\nThe only possible way to have ROI\'d at this point is to have hit it big by being lucky (note, lucky, not smart) by buying a lot of primes at $16 and then selling them at $50.  Some people have been able to do this, and of course, they applaud themselves for being geniuses, when in reality, hindsight is 20/20 of course, and when the $16 hashlets came out, nobody knew what was about to unfold. \n\nI bought some Primes at various prices - and Zens at various prices - but the mixture was not a winning powerball, hence my result of about 20% ROI, which I believe is actually more typical of GAW customers than the people on Reddit and Bitcointalk praising themselves for predictive skill and ferreting out Josh\'s between-the-lines hints.\n\nI will never make ROI, my investment in GAW has served one purpose, and that is to enrich Josh Garza - nothing else. \n\nSo, people say, well, Bad investment, suck it up.  No.  GAW actively mislead. GAW continually said, and says, that Primes would be worth more than $50. Now Primes are effectively being abandoned and you\'re left to gamble with a new decision: HashStaker Primes.  Zens, "the world\'s most profitable pool" - Not so much. Returning to its "former glory" at "twice or even more than it was".  Never happened, never will happen - it\'s now the end of the line for Zens.  Can I count more? SHA-256 for Primes, vanished into thin air. (Probably because it would have been too profitable.)  \n\nOne can say that a bad choice was made if the choices didn\'t involve a shell game and consistent fake-outs from the CEO.  \n\nOthers will talk it up to "skill" on timing the market. There is no such thing. It is luck, and some people, indeed, got lucky. Good for them, but it\'s the exception, not the rule.\n\nSo my main beef with GAW is their misleading practices and constant fall-through on promises and direction shifts.  One jackpot going off in a casino doesn\'t prove that you\'ll win, and it certainly doesn\'t speak to the remainder of the gamblers\' "skill".  What\'s worse, is when many people didn\'t even know they were entering a casino to begin with.\n\nHashlets were advertised as bitcoin miners.

There is NOTHING but a repurposed loyalty point function and a bunch of handwaving. Hell, even HashStakers right now cannot do a single freaking thing.

I use coinbase to buy coins, because it is by far the most convenient way for me to do this.  I am too introverted and too paranoid to use localbitcoins, so for me, its the best method to convert fiat to BTC.\n\n2.  I do not use coinbase as a trading platform or a hot wallet.  Once I get coins from them, they get moved to offline cold storage in one of the industry leading, open source wallets.  \n\n3.  I do actually have trust in Coinbase, mostly because they have taken great steps to show that 97% of their coins are in offline cold storage, and their hot wallet is insured.  Without this, I would not have been able to trust them.\n\n4.  If we want adoption to grow, we need to remember that not all users should be crypto enthusiasts and computer experts.  Widespread adoption will be blocked if it is predicated on having to even understand the true benefits of Open Source software.  Casual users WANT bank like entities they can trust!  \n\n5.  While I agree that bank-like entities seem to be antithetical to the original mission of bitcoin, the fact is that bitcoin is more than large enough to support all of us.  The hardcore folks can buy coins via services like localbitcoins and stay as far off the grid as possible.  The semi hardcore folks can do what I do, where they use a service like Coinbase or Circle to buy coins and then immediately transfer those coins to their own possession and take responsibility for their storage.  The casuals can just treat bitcoin like fiat and keep their assets in bank like entities and never have to worry about the complexities of managing their own wallets.\n\nWhat I really don\'t think is healthy, is this (and I\'m not accusing you of this particularly op, I think its a general ethos that much of the community seems to have) attitude that somehow, if you like Coinbase or Circle, or keep your coins on Blockchain.info, you are somehow "using bitcoin wrong" or "working against the mission of bitcoin".\n\nThat is the kind of hubris that will turn people with a casual interest away from bitcoin and away from online communities like this, and that ultimately slows adoption and helps to keep bitcoin out of the hands of those who truly NEED to use it (for example, people disenfranchised from banks such as those in Africa and South America).\n\nBitcoin is big enough to support all of us, from the hardcore to the casual, and I think its important to help educate people on the technology and the risks/benefits of various storage and purchase methods, without beating them over the head because they are "doing it wrong".\n\nLets use the carrot, rather than the stick to help guide people toward usage that makes the most of the trust-less nature of Bitcoin, if that is our mission.\n\n\n\n': 1, "Affordable mobile trezors would be awesome.

You can see how quickly it started and died in the [Tor Project issue tracker here](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/6116).\n2. The CAB guidelines are amended to create a special case for .onion addresses. There is a proposal that is in the draft stages right now. I\'d link to it, but it isn\'t public yet - but if you would like a copy I could send it to you. The proposal amends sections 9.2.2 and 11.7.1 of CAB\'s *Guidelines for the Issuance and Management of Extended Validation Certificates* as well as adding an Appendix F titled "Issuance of Certificates for .onion Domain Names". There is very solid support for the proposal with just some tweaks to sort out before it goes to a ballot. The chances of some form of this proposal passing between now and next November 1 are very high - nobody disagrees in principal with allowing .onion domain names to be recognized. Without this level of assurance we wouldn\'t have DigiCert signing certificates and we wouldn\'t have Facebook and Blockchain setting them up. In short - we aren\'t idiots, we know about the deprecation date and are actively involved in the proposal to exempt onion.\n\nThe Tor Project has *never* been opposed to this or \'not bothered\'.\n\n> trust me, I could easily register a South African company called Block Chain (Pty) Ltd and get an EV cert that no CA could legitimately deny\n\nI question just who is going to sign that certificate, but in any case I don\'t disagree that checking the address is also important.

It is the reason why we generated a new and more memorable onion address for Blockchain. \n\nThe good thing about the verification is that if you decide to phish blockchain with your own generated onion we\'d then know who you are.\n\n*edit* One thing that I forgot to mention - there is a lot of discussion at the moment about changing the length of onion addresses if it is going to be used for authentication. SHA1 is being phased out of use in SSL because it is weak, meanwhile onion addresses not only use SHA1, but they crop the result and only use the first 80 bits. I got to 10 characters matched of 16 in an onion address with an hour of code and some API calls. We can keep the more readable shorter names and wrap HTTPS over them, or drop HTTPS and adopt longer names more suitable for authentication.

Bank B, in turn, will pay bank A the market interest rate (determined by t-bills or LIBOR) on $1 billion for the same time frame. If interest rates rise, bank A makes money. If interest rates fall, bank A loses money. However, by making the deal, bank A can guarantee that it will never pay more than 5% interest.

Ideally, this should start with creditors which agreed to taking more risks, like bond holders. Depositors should be among the last to be touched, but all riskier-creditors were not enough to cover the losses, the eventually depositors will lose something to.\n * Every creditor receives an amount of stake in the restructured bank. For example, if you lost X$, and 100X$ were necessary to save the bank, you now own 1% of it.\n\nThis looks a better solution to me than bankruptcy because the creditors will probably receive something more, and the company won't need to be liquidated, as in bankruptcy.

I find the notion that money shouldn't be scarce baffling. Scarcity of real resources is *the* fundamental economic problem. The entire purpose of money is to facilitate the exchange and efficient utilization of scarce resources by communicating information about that scarcity. Suggesting that we need to permit a central authority to arbitrarily conjure new units of money into existence so that the supply of money can grow in tandem with the growth of the real economy (but always, apparently, just a few percentage points faster) is like saying that you need to continually increase the number of inches in a foot as your child grows in order to measure his height.

Banks serve big money sinks - big money has a funny way of always getting paid.  And they have no incentive to change anything, as they are thriving under the current system.  \n\nWhile I agree in principle with your logic, I suspect banks will not open up.  Current levels of transparency (none basically for serfs like us) will remain as they are.
