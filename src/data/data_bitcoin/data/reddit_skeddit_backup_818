Maybe I\'m missing something, but if the idea was to standardize around 2048 English words, why was a new set of English words chosen and not the original set from Electrum?\n\nAs I understand it, the only reason the Trezor guys were pushing for the 2048 version was because they complained about certain words in the original 1626 being "hard to memorize" for non-native English speakers like themselves. Their solution: create a new standard English wordlist! Because, why not?\n\n*Why not*?\n\nShould a non-native English speaker really be dictating the **English wordlist standards**?!\n\nYour wallet could use the exact same BIP39 wordlist as some other wallet, and it would NOT work as intended. Because, not only do the two wallets need to share the exact same wordlist, they need to share the exact same **BIP32 implementation**. For those of you not familiar with BIP32, it\'s essentially the logic for generating your HD wallet and it takes several variables. A difference between variable A in Wallet 1 and variable A in Wallet 2 will mean Wallet 1 is not compatible with Wallet 2. It doesn\'t matter if they share the same wordlist. If Multibit does its BIP32 hierarchy one way, and GreenAddress does it another way, the two wallets could have the exact same wordlist but not be compatible. In other words, BIP39 is a clusterfuck. The only saving grace is it\'s encouraging new wallet makers to do the same shit Electrum has always done with mnemonic codes which is a far superior method for Bitcoin storage.': 1, 'Committer and long time fan of Electrum here:\n\nThe wordlist you are referring to is the Electrum wordlist.\n\nThis mnemonic method pre-dates BIP39 and is still in use with the current release 1.9.8 of Electrum.\n\nA lot of services implemented the Electrum mnemonic method BEFORE BIP39 even was passed, and that is why they still use them.\n\nNow to go into geek territory:\n\nYou mentioned that 1626 words is less secure than 2048 words, but unfortunately, this is not true.\n\nThe BIP39 protocol calls for a checksum to be included in the phrase, so every possible combination of words is NOT a valid phrase.\n\nTo give specifics, 2048 is 2^11 which means "11 bits of entropy"... however, for every 3 word group (33 bits) one of those bits is used as a checksum. This means that 3 words only contain 32 bits of entropy.\n\n1626 is more than 10 bits (1024 words) but less than 11 bits (2048 words) of entropy. When grouped into 3 words like the BIP39 states. we get 1626^3 = 4,298,942,376 combinations. If you then look at the number of valid combinations for 3 word pairs of BIP39, it is 2^32 (32 bits of entropy) = 4,294,967,296... so BIP39 is slightly less in the "number of possible outcomes" department.\n\nThere are many benefits and demerits to both methods, like Electrum being a way to mask data, and BIP39 being strictly a method to generate a phrase to be hashed.\n\nBecause Electrum\'s mnemonic allows any combination of words as a valid wallet, plausible deniability is much easier. Switch out two words and deposit a few millis, and if anyone ever held you at gunpoint you could show them how you only have a few millis. BIP39 makes up for this with the "optional password" function, that currently only Trezor and Mycelium (restore only) support. (Every password generates a valid wallet)\n\nFor instance, DarkWallet uses Electrum\'s old mnemonic method.\n\nElectrum 2.0 will have the old mnemonic for backwards compatibility\'s sake, but every new wallet made in 2.0 onward will use BIP39.': 46, "I agree the electrum mnemonic is a better design overall.\nBIP39's only advantage is that you cannot choose your own words,\nwhile almost any electrum word choices are valid.\n\nbip39's overspecified unicode, and unneeded pbkdf step are silly, imo.": 1, "I agree there. BIPs should be really clear about requirements vs possibilities.  \n\nI'm not against specific implementation *speculation*, as long as it's clear.": 1, 'Does a brain wallet give you a BIP32 HD wallet?': 1, 'Paging /u/kyledrake': 3, "BIP39 is finished. But much like BIP32 it's not very restrictive.  \n\nI think at least for English wordlists everyone should simply conform to the standard.": 3, 'Electrum\'s mnemonic came BEFORE BIP39 and was the inspiration for it. Also, Electrum\'s deterministic structure was the first wallet EVER to implement it, and was the inspiration for BIP32.\n\nWhy do I feel like a grandpa yelling at kids that look at the beatles and say "OMG BEATLES SO STOLE THE HOT BRITISH BOY BAND THING FROM ONE DIRECTION LOLOLOL"': 3, 'Bip44 is very reasonable. Who wrote it is irrelevant.': 2, "That isn't correct. All wallets are implementing some form of HD. The seed creation process, while it's true it needs to be the same, will not guarantee compatibility. \n\nHow you derive keys from that seed needs to be identical across wallets for there to be compatibility. As I said there isn't a consensus.\n\nTo give you a concrete example. In the wallet I've been developing we wanted to use the BIP0044 hierarchy to derive the keys (in addition to the BIP0039 word list) so that it will be compatible with trezor. \n\nHowever, BIP0044 requires that to create a new 'account' in the account level, the previous account must have been used for at least one transaction. \n\nThis is a bit restrictive so I emailed Stick and Slush and asked them if they would consider amending BIP0044 to allow for more than one look ahead account to be created. They declined out of a desire to keep it simple. \n\nSo as of right now, if you stick a seed from our wallet into trezor, trezor could fail to derive all the keys because of the different hierarchy treatment... despite the fact that both wallets use BIP0039.
