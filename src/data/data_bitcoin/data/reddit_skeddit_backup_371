To do this, a miner has to make a guess at a certain number called a *nonce*, do some computation called a *hash*  (this process is called *hashing*) that depends on that number and the bitcoin transactions the miner wants to include in the block, and see if the result is less than some other number (which is inversely proportional to the difficulty, more on that below). If it is less, the block is valid, and the miner publishes the block and wins the reward (currently 25 BTC). Of course, the higher the difficulty, the harder it is to find such a nonce that has the right property.\n\nThe hash rate represents how many hashes the collective of all the bitcoin miners can perform in a given amount of time. So, like 100 petahashes/second (or whatever the number currently is). If more people start mining, or they start using better miners, that number goes up.\n\nDifficulty is a number (an integer in fact) that represents how difficult it is to mine a new block. The higher the number, the harder it is to mine. This difficulty is periodically adjusted automatically by the bitcoin algorithm (approximately once every 2 weeks, or to be more precise, once every 2016 blocks). The idea behind the readjustment is that if the collective miners out there get better at their job (increase their hash rate), they will start mining blocks faster. Satoshi wanted a relatively steady rate of coin production, so to compensate for changes in the hash rate, the difficulty is periodically adjusted so that it is roughly proportional to the hash rate.

That is a tiny increase compared to the huge benefit of being able to continue to use 0-conf as it currently is. Also, miner's fees are only increased in the case of the receiver using child-pays-for-parent to increase the fee. There are other ways to solve this, such as the client rebroadcasting the tx with a higher fee (the old tx will not enter chain).\n\nThis can be pretty much invisible to both sender and receiver in well designed clients, so I fail to see how the user experience would ever be worse than full RBF. In full RBF it is no less visible.\n\nFurther, the full RBF user experience of someone's funds getting 100% burned to miner's fees is a really bad experience (although from a game theoretic perspective probably rare).

I have $5000 coming to me, it costs $0.15 to make sure I get it, or I can risk the transaction dropping or I can wait 24 hours for a single confirm.\n\n> Miners have realized they can make more by taking higher fees\n\nFull RBF relies on the game theory argument that rational senders will not want their transaction burned as a miner fee, so they don't try to screw the receiver.\n\nYou can also use game theory to see that miners don't want to damage the network that they profit from. There are ZERO full RBF mining pools right now, and there are several FSS RBF pools.\n\n> A wallet that has higher fees being invisible? No thanks. \n\nThis is the case with full RBF and FSS RBF.

In fact, I have a friend who works between Shell\'s tech POS and consumers, and their numbers would strongly argue that Airmiles is a successful loyalty program.  There are a number of these programs in circulation and I do think they get a boost from this program in capturing that 60% of customers that might have been occasional / once a year purchasers into higher volume / regular purchasers.  Also think it depends upon the category description in regards to say, gas station, grocery shopping, or the brands providing the consumer goods ie Honda or Colgate etc.  I think they grow in very different contexts and consumer behavior in regards to purchasing brands at a store, or the actual brand itself should be looked at in more detail. \n    \nI love that book to shreds, but I also believe he discounted a few ideas that have a proven track record in specific categories as noted above (a retailer brand or a shop that sells the goods vs a product brand). For example the decision process when choosing a local gas station on grocery store is going to be different than the way they consider the brand that creates their toothbrush or a pair of shoes.

If they are lucky, they will solve the puzzle before they can download the parent block.  Then they, and all other pools, must immediately start mining a new one on top of the empty child block, even before it gets out to the nodes.  Only if everybody is unlucky they will have time to receive the parent block, fetch another blockful of transactions, and add them to the block that they are mining.\n\nHash stealing is normally much safer than "SPV mining" because the pool that is the source of the stolen hash has strong incentives to generate valid blocks and send out valid hashes to its members.  It failed in that case because the source was running out-of-date software, not because it was malicious or did something wrong themselves.  And it was out-of-date because BIP66 was programmed to go into effect when 1 every 20 miners were still unprepared to handle it... \n\nThe pools will not stop doing that optimization because it would put them at a clear disadvantage with respect to closed miners (who can steal their hashes anyway).

Satoshi\'s reasoning seems straightforward enough to a programmer:\n\nFirst, the IEEE double-precision floating-point format can handle integers up to 2^53 without rounding.  Any integer above that will be rounded off to some multiple of 2, 4, 8, etc.  That format is used by Excel, javascript, matlab, awk, and many other languages and applications that accountants and economists use.  Accountants and auditors, in particular, get upset when the debits and credits differ by a digit in the last place.  So the currency of the world had better use no more than 2^53 atomic units.  Infact, to avoid rounding during simple math operations, it is would be good practice to leave a couple of bits of slack, and make that 2^51 atomic units at most.  That would be 2\'251\'799\'813\'685\'248 or about 2.25 quadrillion of the units now called "satoshis".\n\nBut those would be like US cents.  The main unit had better be some multiple of that.  There was no way of guessing how valuable the units would be.  That must be why he chose to put the decimal point right in the middle of the 16 decimal digits.  That is, with 1 bitcoin = 100\'000\'000 satoshis, the largest amount would be 22\'517\'998***.***136\'852\'48 bitcoins, with 8 digits on each side.\n\nThen he had to pick a block reward schedule to get most of the coins out in a reasonable time frame.  A gradually decreasing reward was obviously better than a fixed reward that stopped suddenly after some time.  The simplest gradual formula was to start with some value R0 and cut it in half every N blocks; that would be the easiest to program and explain. In order to generate all the 2^51 coins at the end, the two parameters had to satisfy N = 2^50 / R0.  Picking R0 = 50 BTC = 5\'000\'000\'000 satoshis (a nice round rumber) gave N = 225\'179.9813685 blocks; a little more than 4 years (assuming 1 block every 10 minutes).  By rounding N down to 210\'000 he made that expected interval to be almost exactly 4 years.  \n\nBut that rounding meant that the total issue at the end of time will not be 2^51 or 2^51 \xe2\x88\x92 1 satoshis, but a little less: [20999999.97690000 BTC, to be exact](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Controlled_supply#Projected_Bitcoins_Long_Term).
