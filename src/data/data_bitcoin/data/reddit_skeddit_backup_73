Non-upgraded nodes, however, will not see nor validate the witness data and will consider all witness programs as anyone-can-spend scripts (except a few edge cases where the witness programs are equal to 0, which the script must fail).

The problem is Bitcoin is not in a vacuum, it exists with 1000+ other cryptos and alts.

People aren\'t going to pay more to transfer bitcoin over any other available crypto that shares the same utility function. \n\nCores plan to keeps bitcoin viable by raising prices (effectively restricting user number), in the long term actually makes bitcoin non viable vs alternative cryptos. The only reason bitcoin as a settlement layer exists as a proposal is because users have given it that value (utility for payment) via network effects. Without these network effects Bitcoin is just "crypto #1" and can be replaced easily by crypto #2. As users leave the value proposition falls and bitcoin acts neither a currency nor a settlement layer. This is why alts are rising as btc is falling, it\'s not an attack on bitcoin by shadowy forces, it\'s financially invested actors acting rationally.

I wrote it kind of fast so I was not thinking about the implications of being too broad in that statement.  What I meant is that the current attack vector would not be possible unless we were near full by *real* usage. And by current attack vector I mean simply filling up the remaining blockspace with transactions moving coin\'s around to and fro, with no real purpose other than to obstruct others usage.\n\nI would suggest that the community refrain from using the word "spam" from now on, as that does not really fit the profile of whats going on here. Spam usually has a reasonably narrow purpose, its massive broadcasts of information in the hopes of capturing a few less aware individuals, in order to lure them into some sort of situation that creates a incentive for the spammer.\n\nI think the term, which I\'ve edited to reflect above, should be called "Obstruction tx\'s" or "obstructionist transactions", because it seems the main motive of the "spammer" is to obstruct others usage of the blockchain.\n\nThere are a number of parties that could economically benefit from this type of behavior, such as the miners who plausibly could earn more revenue by accelerating transaction costs due to constrained space, or by developers of alternative implementations who wish to challenge the status quo. The latter may not appear to have a direct *economic* incentive, but I would imagine these developers think bitcoin will suffer massive speculative attacks if the network is congested to the point that we are having difficulties using it, which would then directly impact their investments. This is a rather long-route economic incentive, but one could also speculate that there\'s a direct incentive for them to absorb market share of users so that their alternative clients will be successful, with many obvious incentives following.': 1, 'this way of putting it makes it so clear.': 2, 'excellent rebuttal!': 11, "True, different designs will be varyingly susceptible to node-targeted attacks.

It needs to download and upload multiple times over well under 30 seconds. Otherwise, the relay time across the network cannot perform sufficiently, and mining is forced to be centralised and exposed to censorship risks. Essentially this means that even 1 MB blocks have an typical node requirement of 2.1 Mbps upload, well over what is available in the average city today.\nYou also need to pay attention to total transfer limits. Typical limits for cellular connections, for example, are 5 GB, which is just barely enough to leech on 1 MB blocks (forget using it for the average node).

The p2p code on bitcoin is in need of major upgrades to help distribution of blocks. There are a lot of people focusing on this, and with a upgrade to 2mb we will have *years* to resolve the issue which I have full faith that it will be taken care of within that time frame.\n\nOr, we can continue to frustrate the customers and cause mayhem by leaving it where it is.": 1, "No. It's not  the attack is always there yoiu just notice it more because fees rise to punish the attacker as blockspsce becomes limited.

This is already unlikely to be true, as there will be little incentive to broadcast transactions that are unlikely to make it into blocks in the near future, or try to receive them.  New filters that allow nodes to communicate what an acceptable tx fee is to other nodes will allow them to keep the lowest value transactions from ever being broadcast to them.

Plenty of others are vying for Satoshi\'s legacy, without evidence you are just another nutty claimant. Personally, I don\'t make decisions without evidence so I will keep an open mind but I think it is fair to be sceptical.\n\nI also have PGP keys from the mid-1990s, probably earlier than 1998 if that matters, although I have not used them for many years. I think I initialised my PGP keys around 1995-96. I was a little paranoid, I used 4096 bit keys even back then, even though 40-bit RC2/RC4 was still generally considered secure back then and 1024 bits was considered "overkill".\n\nI am sure that plenty of others - like us - were smart enough to use strong encryption, including PGP, when needed back then. PGP has been around since the very early 1990\'s so it is not special to have old keys.\n\nAs for your language skills, I may have seen some of Satoshi\'s emails but I am not sure. I have read Satoshi\'s paper and the language is impeccable so your "ghost writer" did a great job if that was indeed the case.\n\nAs has been discussed many times, there are many ways for Satoshi to prove his identity. He/she could move some of the old coins from one wallet to another - so simple. No need to "fix" old and "lost" encryption keys, which is likely an impossible task. Of course, Satoshi would know all of this already so the fact that you haven\'t announced your "second coming" with a movement of primordial coins means that scepticism is very appropriate.\n\nI\'m sorry that you feel insulted by my glib comments but I hope you\'d understand that people would be sceptical of your claims without impeccable proof, which the real Satoshi could easily supply.\n\nOld PGP keys won\'t constitute proof without a definite and unarguable link to the "real" Satoshi Nakamoto.
