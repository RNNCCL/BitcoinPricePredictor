The concept being that bigger blocks would exacerbate bandwidth differences, penalizing miners with skinnier pipes, and leaving them with a higher orphan rate than they would if blocks were smaller.\n\nReducing the amount of data that needs to be transmitted upon block discovery to a single packet means that latency, and not bandwidth becomes the controlling factor.  If it takes 2000ms to push the packet globally, that would only put a miner at a 0.33% disadvantage vs a miner with an (impossible) 0ms delay. \n\nThe aggregate amount of data that is transmitted would almost certainly be higher under a plan like this, as pre-block \xe2\x80\x98coordination\xe2\x80\x99 will be occurring, but the burstiness will be reduced.

As such it doesn't have to keep it in RAM.\n\n\nThis is the first article I referenced when I was investigating this: http://wlangiewicz.com/blog/2014/10/24/how-to-put-custom-messages-into-bitcoin-blockchain-op-return/\n\n\nEdit: Btproof.com was more of a hack similar to what a lot of developers were doing in the past (thus creating the need and addition of OP_RETURN).

The average default rate on our platform is about 8% and since we run the platform on a free-market model, this means that the average lender under-performs the market by about 1.5% too.  If you look at the lender's ROI, they do indeed average about 2% loss. This is entirely consistent with the way the free market works and this statistic didn't change when we cut the default rate in half, from about 16% to 8% [2]. We implemented filters on our platform that brought down the default rate by more than 50% in March[3] (and it's remained at about 8% since theN), but surprisingly, the loss to lenders remained at 2%. This was also true with Prosper when they first started: things were so bad that they posted 26.1% defaults and the ROI was about -4.64% [4] in their first 2 years. LendingClub posted 14.81% defaults and -3.44% ROI in their first year [5].\n\n> It may surprise you that (also according to Lendstats) many investors actually made money. If you look at all 4,450 Prosper 1.0 investors who invested in at least 100 loans 858 investors had a positive return with the best ROI at 9.8%. How did these people make decent returns when most investors lost money? They avoided the higher risk loans. [4]  \n\n\nSo what was Prosper's solution?  \n1. Stop the dutch-auction.  \n2. Take ownership of the lending decisions: i.e. they did their own underwriting on the loans, instead of letting the individual lenders do it.  \n\n\nMy point is that there will always be scammers. You can blame us for not cutting enough scammers out of the platform, but regardless if the default rate is 8% or 26%, the lenders will continue to make the same fundamental mistake: they under-price the loans in a free-market model. So the real solution is to do what LendingClub and Prosper did, and to my dislike... what BTCJam is doing also: risk-based pricing and auto-invest.

If you study how network effects grow (Facebook, Twitter, internet, etc), they have always grown by targeting a niche audience first. This is why any silicon valley youtube video talking about growing a business has always warned startups not to target a large audience (leads to bankruptcy). \n\nWhy target a niche? Because they are often the most loyal of customers and they have the time and energy to spread brand awareness. As well as the cash reserves. \n\nWhen you have no brand loyalty, the customer base will be too flimsy and can leave at the bat of an eyelash. It's like building a house on quicksand. Brand loyalty is the basis of any business. Targeting ONLY microtransactions is basically suicide at the moment. Because you are targeting people that have no loyalty and are people that do not believe in the product enough to fork over large amounts of money. Sure, it's possible that a lot of people can enter the bitcoin ecosystem at once through micro transactions. But as they enter, so they can easily leave again the moment something happens (and as we know, in bitcoin there's ALWAYS something happening).\n\nThis is basic knowledge for startups. Paradoxically, they become mainstream by not targeting the mainstream first.\n\nThe privacy issue is important in this regard.

Its important.\n\nThinking that higher fees do not drive away users is a big mistake.  Bitcoin gets a lot of its utility by being cheap to transact.  Having higher fees will make it much less appealing to users.  Sure there could still be value if transactions are high, but it would only hold Bitcoin back and make it be replaced by a different currency.  To think that the common man should not be included in your thinking is a huge mistake.  Sure the common man is not the only target.  Big Investment firms liek Fidelity are a target too.

Sure big wigs have influence, but in the end the community has the most influence because we decide which coin to use, and which fork of the software to run.  You are misundestanding the essence of Bitcoin as a social technology.  This is a big mistake a lot of people are making, especially the ones wanting to hold back Bitcoin with a very low blocksize limit.  Bitcoin is and has taken off because of the mainstream.  Its not a myth.  Its regular people who want freedom to buy drugs or have privacy, or sound money.  Its always about the people especially with a social technology.  Bitcoin is much more an incentive system between human beings in a social network than it is a crypto/mathematical system.  This is the big mistake a lot of the mathematicians and coders in the community make.  They are mathematical brains and can't see the social game theory aspect of things.  Saotshi was a wizard at the social game theory because he realized Bitcoin was not perfect, while the people like Peter Todd can't accept Bitcoin's imperfection and kludginess, so they only use the game theory to find flaws and then overstate those flaws as being more serious than they really are.  People like him underestimate the power of the human social element and incentives involved in Bitcoin, which counteracts the flaws.\n\nSure we should hand Fidelity over 50MB, I think thats even too concervative.  100MB would be better in the short term.

Turns out, 20% of your customers give you 80% of your profits when you run the numbers. This occurs in every industry, including Bitcoin of course.\n\nHence, in Bitcoin terms, the most valuable users are the ones **most willing to pay** for the priviledge of making blockchain transactions. When people tell you they aren\'t willing to pay $20 to settle on the blockchain, what they\'re saying is their transactions just aren\'t valuable enough to warrant the use of BTC on-chain.\n\nThis was a crucial insight by Trace because SO MANY people who FUD the fee market for good reason can\'t envision themselves paying a $20 fee to make a payment of trivial value at Starbucks. Which makes sense. But these people need to engage in introspective thinking on this issue. It\'s been said too many times: your coffee purchases are simply NOT the ideal use case for Bitcoin. You know this because you\'re not willing to pay a $20 fee to send them through.\n\nThose types of transactions are trivial, meaningless and can be done in numerous different ways. For example, you can use [Stash](https://stashcrypto.com) the public facing wallet for OT to make those payments without paying a fee. You can use LN when that\'s developed. You can use Circle or Xapo etc.\n\nContrary to popular belief, you don\'t need to indelibly record your coffee purchases in the blockchain for the payment to be valid at a merchant, no your privacy won\'t be wholesale protected but you can *take precautions* and for God\'s sake it\'s coffee.\n\nImportantly, your monetary sovereignty will remain maximized to the extent conserving blockspace makes full nodes easy and obtainable for the ordinary person - ie YOU. On that note:\n\n> *Trace Meyer*: For example, I was having dinner with Dr. Adam Back, Gavin Andresen and Greg Maxwell. I brought this point up, "Why do we hire Bitcoin?". And both Greg Maxwell and Adam Back said, "Monetary sovereignty". Gavin said, "**Because when I make a payment, I feel good**"': 8, 'good or service': 5, "Usually I agree with most of what Trace says.  I agree with some of his points in the video about confidential transactions.  But I really disagree with him deeply on what he said about a blocksize increase, and about making people want to pay to use Bitcoin.  People should not have to pay much to use Bitcoin, we want to keep the cost of using Bitcoin as low as possible.  The goal is to get more and more people to use Bitcoin, that is what makes the price rise.  People don't want to pay a lot, they want things cheap.  People will buy Bitcoins to take part in the network if the fees are cheap.  But Trace says that the more people that want to pay fees correlates to the market cap.  That may or may not be true depending how you look at it, or could be correlation not causation, but I think its a mistake to think our goal should be getting people to want to pay higher fees.  The goal should be to get fees low as possible so people can use Bitcoin cheaply, then they will buy Bitcoins raising the price.  Less people will buy Bitcoin if the fees are large, which will keep the price down.  Since it seemed Trace was worried about the price.\n\nAlso I think he came across as kind of a dick how he attacked Gavin, and people wanting science experiments.  He also comes across as elitist saying only the big money players matter.  This is an open source project and anybody can write code, and support whatever software they want.  Sure money plays a role in it, but its not all about money especially for open source projects, and especially for ones like Bitcoin that are social technologies.  With a social network like Bitcoin each and every player is a player, not just the big whigs.  Also Trace should realize that Fidelity Investments wants to experiment with using the blockchain, but can't flip the switch on their beta program because it will instantly fill Bitcoin's capacity according to Jeff Garzik.  So if Trace cares about big money coming in to raise the Bitcoin price he should support an increase in blocksize ASAP.  There is a reason this debate is front and center and the most important issue right now.": 4, 'Wow you totally missed the mark. Trace was perfectly right about transaction fees. Everything he said was obviously right from a business acumen standpoint. Good customers are paying customers, not ones that wish to drive all of the cost down and not pay due price for the service they use. Cost is obviously not our main concern, censorship-resistance through decentralization is and this has a price. \n\nThe mistake in your logic is assuming that all prospective users are somehow driven away by high transaction fees. That could only be true if cheap transactions were the only value proposition of Bitcoin but it isn\'t. The majority of capital flowing through worldwide markets are not deterred by transactions fees, they are handicapped by political/legal friction. Bitcoin excels at removing this friction and an enormous amount of investors recognize the value in this. Stop mistaking the common man on the street as the only target market for Bitcoin, this shows a tragic ignorance of the dynamics of an economy. The consumers are not the only players in this game. \n\n>\xc2\xad\xc2\xadSure money plays a role in it, but its not all about money \n\nThis is where your opinion diverges from his. Bitcoin is absolutely first and foremost about money, monetary freedom to be precise. All the rest is bells and whistles at this point and has never shown to be the driver of Bitcoin economic growth and certainly doesn\'t project to be in the near future. \n\nBitcoin is not a social network, it is a value network. "The big wigs" certainly are more attractive as prospective adopters given the amount of capital that they control.
