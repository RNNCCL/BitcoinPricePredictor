It might make sense (appealing to users who want true pseudonymity), ignoring the legal aspect.\n\nBut the game itself is operated by a central company.

And this is what confuses me: if you are central bank that needs policy control, why pursue or promote a decentralized architecture like the block chain? You *might* be able to cobble together complex mechanisms to incentivize miner behavior that roughly conforms to your policies (effectively rendering the network of miners centralized), but then there few advantages left over a conventional system architecture. What I think central banks really want is a digital currency based on a conventional database (perhaps with high redundancy and hardened against DDoS) that is *standardized* nationwide or even globally.  \n\nYou mentioned a good point: in the past, the central bank was the only game in town. Once they set policy, nearly everyone in the economy was stuck with those rules (precious metals were pretty much the only out, and they weren't/aren't viable as digital currencies). Now, you've got Bitcoin and everything else.

In practice, blockchain is of no use to Bank of England.\n\nMy response was not to the article, but a mere correction to sumBTC that it is indeed possible to decentralize only one aspect of such systems, and there may be future use cases for it.\n\nI have read some State supporters here arguing that while the State is necessary, it can be separated from finance. I imagine they would believe that it is a use case, however disconnected from reality the idea is.\n\n> You might be able to cobble together complex mechanisms to incentivize miner behavior that roughly conforms to your policies (effectively rendering the network of miners centralized)\n\nFees should be enough as an incentive; otherwise Bitcoin is screwed as well.\n\nAs in the game example, the incentive to mine the central bank currency can be perfectly external. Like being able to pay your taxes with it, being seamlessly interoperable with conventional banking system, etc.\n\nWhat the central bank would keep is the ability to print money at will, and a kill switch for the system if they want to. What they would lose is the ability to censor transactions.

Yes, this opens them up to lobbying, vote-buying, and everything we're against, but at least it's not a guarantee this will happen; they *may not* become bought by money.\n\nHowever, if we close the vote (we make those same votes secret), we will have no idea if that same representative actually voted in our best interest. We have no idea how well of a job they did representing us; providing the public with a guaranteed zero amount of information to go on when the next election comes around. In fact, that allows the same politician to say they voted 100% in our favor during their last term just to get re-elected again, and we would have no evidence to prove them wrong... so this may lead to people voting for the same politician over and over, who, as it turns out, may continually vote 100% *against* their interests.\n\nEDIT: Secret ballots don't hurt the country when citizens abuse the voting secrecy to lie and say they voted for a person (when they actually didn't), just to look good among their peers.

This could be implemented with a public deterministic hash of the private key of the voter + the identifying constant of the vote + some type of fraction identifier, and a Zero-knowledge proof that this hash is correct and tied to this vote fraction.\n\nSo if you have 3 vote fractions you can show one (unless you wiped your traces of it), and claim you have no others. In reality you canceled it out. Creating multiple fractions that conflict would produce the same fraction identifier hash = rejected as double voting. I\'m not an expert at math (have not done anything more complex than trigonometry and derivatives), so I\'m not sure what else you\'d need to prove to make sure the multiple vote fractions are "tied together" mathematically as one vote (so fractions supposed to cancel out really does cancel out, vs looking like 3 votes instead of one). I\'m not sure how to make the math for vote fractions recreate the effects of the physical paper 3-ballot system. I would also like to allow for a user determined amount of fractions as long as you can prove they cancel out correctly to have the effect of one vote. Maybe you\'d just skip the cancelling out requirement, it would probably only work as intended anyway if you can guarantee all fractions are counted... ': 1, 'The technology is called Counterparty, it\'s not created by SWARM but by the Counterparty-team. Take a look here: http://counterparty.io\n\nCounterparty uses the BTC-Blockchain for their operations. So on Counterparty you can store coins like GEMS, StorJ and Swarmcoins. The technology makes it possible for people to create a new coin and even to trade them decentralized or to pay out BTC or other coins as a "dividend". So here\'s the idea that got SWARM going:\n\nFound a company, create 100 mljn coins on Counterparty (Lock them!, so no more Swarmcoins can be created!) and do a crowdfunding. So people sent BTC and got Swarmcoin back for it. SWARM is helping other start-ups get funded, so they do research on projects/start-up\'s and help some of them to launch their own coins. And x% of these coins will be payed out as "dividend" to Swarmcoin-holders. So you start as an investor buying Swarmcoin, and in your counterparty wallet you get new coins from new projects after their launch. \n\nOn top of that SWARM is building software to work with Ethereum, Counterparty and more platforms as well. Making things like decentralized voting possible, so imagine buying coins in a newly launched project, than being able to vote on certain topics for that project in a safe, decentralized way. Does that make sense?? Will look for some tech-info about the project for you.... \n\nHere\'s a great video showing the coins being created and locked, also some good explanation:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBBvay6n5kc\n\n': 1, 'I said "Obama was the greatest person we ever voted into office.. until he got into office."': 0, 'The voting has been reset back to the old, dependable way using Helios.': 3, 'Hi there, I\'m a volunteer for SWARM.

They (the people who bought them) store them in a Counterwallet and everybody still has their coins so nobody got conned (read about the tech behind the counterwallet, it\'s quite secure). Blockchain-voting was already done by SWARM using "voting coins" on counterparty. It absolutely worked, no question about it. But letting people sent coins to an address is not the most user friendly way to do voting, so now they\'re working on a new platform, still on the blockchain, but more easy to use with the regular internet.\n\nBoth the Bitcoin foundation and SWARM decided to try it out. Both teams worked very hard to make it work. This is what the foundation posted on their blog:\n\n*This voting platform is new and still in beta and there\'s a real risk that members may not experience the most seamless process. Your feedback is important so that we can improve for the next vote.*  \n\nAnd now you\'re angry that things didn\'t work out? Here\'s some more info about what SWARM is doing:\n\n*With the launch of Ethereum (both via Counterparty and on the main Ethereum chain) we are launching the Swarm as a completely autonomous organization, the first fully functioning Distributed Collaborative Organization.\nAll Swarm tech will be open sourced and made available on a new license model that makes it usable to people who have SWARM. This represents a new type of intellectual property model that we believe provides an appropriate incentive model for building collaborative organizations.* \n\nhttps://medium.com/@Swarm/state-of-the-swarm-7835b413f3d4\n\nSo as you see, SWARM will not only work just on a blockchain, it will be working on different blockchains, different platforms (counterparty, Ethereum) bringing it all together and it will even be open source. Next to that they did some great legal research fixing a lot of legal problems. So they\'re not only doing decentralized crowdfunding (why I started following them), they even do a lot more, taking risk as well. That\'s a spirit I like. And you know what? If you want to complain about how your blockchain-voting didn\'t work out the first time you tried it...... Feel free to do so. It\'s a free country isn\'t it?

For that reason, one cannot use transactions with many inputs to DDOS the network.  \n\nHowever, in order to motivate greedy miners, it may be necessary to also charge a fee for each distinct input *address* (not for each input *UTXO*, or per kB).   The client has no control on the number of UTXOs in his wallet, but splitting among several addresses is his decision, so it is fair and proper that he be charged for that.\n\nAgain, I am thinking from the point of view of a prospective client.

If you don\'t like it, don\'t use it.\n\nBut it is not quite logic to me what you say. Assume you as a customer want to make an online-purchase for 10 Euro. The merchant gives you two choices:\n\n1.)

A cartel with more than half the mining power certainly can jam the blockchain, and users and nodes cannot prevent that without violating the central principle of the bitcoin protocol.
