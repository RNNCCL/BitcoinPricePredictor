Anyone against Bitcoin, will just try to claim victory just because the price is down from where it was.  Its pretty lame really.  The trolls did the same thing when the price dropped from $30 to $2 in the first bubble.  \n\nJust because the market is so stupid because of Fed QE policies, and scams, which Peter Schiff knows full well about, does not mean Bitcoin is not sound money and is not reaching wider adoption.  \n\nWe are launching a brand new currency, and nobody said its going to be smooth or easy.  A lot of coins were concentrated in a small number of hands, which is why it takes a lot of volatility to shake those coins out for better distribution.\n\nBitcoin has has wild success.  VC's have invested over 400 million dollars into Bitcoin companies, and that is just what we know about.  This is over 10% of Bitcoin's entire market cap alone, and probably a lot more when considering lost coins.  This market is so tiny, and the world financial system is so corrupt and fragile like a house of cards, its only a matter of time before people FLEE into bitcoin and other assets like gold and silver.  Peter Schiff should really know this, but he has a psychological leaning towards his gold and silver business, and Bitcoin competes with that.\n\nAnyways you think those VCs are going to let Bitcoin price fade away, and lose their hundreds of millions of investment? No they are going to pump the price, which is extremely easy for them because the market is so small.

Education always precedes adoption.\n\nI\'m also hopeful he\'ll eventually admit his error if he\'s wrong.

VCs throw money at 50 startups and hope that 5 of them are successful enough to make up for the rest. Do you think bitcoin is the only digital currency/payments investment that they are betting on? They are betting on the payments space as a whole, including ApplePay, Stripe, and others. If one of them succeeds, they don't need bitcoin to succeed. If they think bitcoin's a dud, then they'll pull their funding. *They're not married to bitcoin.* They're not going to use VC money to defend bitcoin's price while early adopters dump coins on them.

If he wasn't profitable, he wouldn't keep mining because he has a long-term expectation that bitcoin's price would increase, because he could just stop mining (and stop losing money) and just buy bitcoins instead of mining them, if he had an investment perspective and had to choose between investing X bitcoin to mine 0.9 X bitcoin, or simply invest and buy X bitcoin outright without trouble or any mining losses. Miners don't make price-speculation a big part of their strategy, if they're unprofitable they simply turn off the machines and just buy.\n \nThe exception to miners not mining at a loss could be China, where purchasing bitcoins is hard to do, but purchasing technology isn't. So they might be mining at a slight loss, because it's the only way to turn a large amount of yuan into bitcoin, by buying hardware instead. Could be, but even this is doubtful as it's quite a lot of effort. And with effort, you can purchase bitcoin in China, too.\n\nBut other than that, it just means miners are still profitable despite a lower price. And this makes sense. What a lot of people forget is that if the price stays at $300 for 100 years, mining power will continue to increase because hash per dollar keeps getting cheaper. At the pace of new mining ASICs being developed that do more for the same price, it's not strange to see mining power increase by 10% in the same month the total mining revenues drop by 10%. It could be some new ASICs that get 30% more efficiency just hit the market, while 10-month old price-inefficient ASICs are being replaced.": 3, 'It is rational to believe that all markets are to some degree and times irrational.': 3, 'this aint the bottom though\n': -1, 'GAW was a miner company that turned into a "cloud mining" company that turned into an alt-coin "cloud mining" company.

If I mine, I am earning. Moreover I'm earning first, paying expenses second. If I just buy bitcoins, I am not earning anything. Moreover I have no money to buy bitcoins with, since I can't just borrow something like electricity which I can pay for later.\n\n> If I have invested thousands in ASICS I'm not going to sell you one for less than what I put into it...

Open source code (even if you can't audit it yourself, the transparency helps keep the developers in check)\n2. Own your own private keys. Hosted wallets have historically been a danger.\n3. Private keys encrypted WITH YOUR PASSWORD so a compromised system doesn't necessarily get to your funds. Look for those that do strong, GPU resistant password derivation (key stretching)\n4.

Formal decisions are necessary to register a property, to grant a mortgage, to impose or lift restrictions and to allocate a certain land use, which implies discretionary powers of the public sector.* \n\nFor individuals in developing countries, land ownership corruption is a huge factor in limiting economic growth. When people can have land and property swept from under their feet, without documentation to fight abuse, then they don\'t create long-term businesses and institutions. \n\n2015 will be the battle of [smart-contracts](http://factom.org/) & colored-coin projects to try and recreate the extensive bureaucracies of the "1st world" with transparent and incorruptible public crypto-ledgers.\n\n**To me, this is why I\'m excited for bitcoin.** Not because the world around it is crumbling, it\'s not, but because it gives a whole new way to solve huge problems **and** there exists people willing to try these experimental utilities.': 4, 'Exactly!

I don\'t count distribution schemes with same eventuality as different in this context, nor do I count slightly different numeric tweaks.\n\nSimilarly, one chain per technical properties is optimal.\n\nOf course experimentation and redundancy are very important, and none of the above has to be Bitcoin. However, I don\'t see a reason for them to not include Bitcoin. Many people like the Bitcoin+sidechains idea because it provides all of the above.\n\n> Bitcoin is a monopoly\n\nNo, it isn\'t by any possible sense of the word.\n\n> We need multiple blockchains to be in balance with each other\n\nWhy? We need multiple stuff going on, sure, but why blockchains? And how do they balance each other? IMHO there are far too many blockchains. Why don\'t you push for other transaction database structures for instance? That would provide the required research we need if the "chain of blocks" idea fails.\n\n> putting all eggs in one basket\n\nI agree that investing in radically different approaches is good, but all these developments need effort which you are spreading thin on basically the same basket. All of these depend on the same approach, and most even on the same codebase. That is not healthy.\n\n> The "one blockchain/bitcoin is like the internet" analogy should be replaced with "multiple blockchains are like the internet\xe2\x80\x9d analogy.\n\nHow does that analogy work?

Transfers are instant, verification takes a little bit of time. Only limited by the current code, can/will be changed to handle an infinite number of transactions per second. \n\n2. No one knows who owns what wallet address, and if they do...move the coins. \n\n3. You can just change the units...1000bits to a Bitcoin...this can continue with different units.\n\n4. Blockchain is about 20GB, say it increased in size by 1000, that would cover the population, and would be a size of 20TB...I can store that in my pocket with a few hard drives. Data Centers store in the exabytes...so it is not even close.\n\n5. There is more to the energy efficiency than that, Bitcoin is not just a transaction service. \n\n6. Again, coding can change that, to an UNLIMITED number per second. You can opt to have no verifications, which is why instant works for stores.\n\n7. You are looking from a consumer point of view, money doesn't go into merchants accounts on weekends, or public holidays and takes a 3-4 days to actually go through. \n\n8. Bitcoin transactions fees, if you choose to use that option to speed up verification, are minisicule compared to the 2-3% Visa charges. I just checked, to send $100 via western union, would cost me $5...5% is too much.\n\n9. That is the whole issue, there should be a way to transmit things for free.

Visa handles 7000 transactions a second.\n\n\n> Anonymous Transactions: I disagree that banks should have the right to see where you are spending your hard earned money and especially choose when to freeze the account.\n\nAnd if you use magic beans, your boss can see that you spent them buying a dildo, as well as all the other places you spent them. I'd much rather a bank, regulated by actual, enforceable privacy laws, see where I spent my money rather than my boss.\n\n> Endlessly divisible\n\n[probably a positive if you were a robot] (https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/aa/08/c3/aa08c3aec0007713abd200832a69cda7.jpg), not so much for humans.

Already the blockchain is several gigs in size. If it were to actually hold trillions of dollars worth of txns, it would require a data center bigger than that of google to hold it. Where does that then leave your decentralization? \n\n> No more wasted taxpayer money on bank bailouts\n\nYes, instead it pumps tons of CO2 into the atmosphere by wasting CPU cycles on calculating useless hashes.\n\n\n> It is time for a change: everything that we deal with digitally is instant\n\nI'll remind you again of the 4 transaction per second on BTC vs 7000 transactions per second on visa. Txns take ages to verify and *can* go missing. \n\n> Money is slow and expensive: digging around in your wallet for change, waiting for a cashier to give you your change. \n\nSorry to know you've never been acquainted with a debit card.\n\n> Western Union and PayPal both have fees\n\nSo does BTC. Never heard of transaction fees? Not to mention, both WU and Paypal are a heck of a lot faster than BTC with its 4 transactions per second cap.\n\n> Why should it cost me a decent meal at Chipotle just to send some money home?\n\nBecause you are employing the services of an intermediary.
