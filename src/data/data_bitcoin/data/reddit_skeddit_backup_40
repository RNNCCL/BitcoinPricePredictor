I am using the term US, when more accurately it is the symbiotic beast of US banks and US government here. All other participants were to fix their each currency's price to USD.

They will purchase said Bitcoin through an exhange or possibly an ATM service.  If that provider also provides the ability to open a channel between the user and themselves then isn't that going to be the easiest route for a new user ?  They'll also gain access to many other users (and their channels) at the same time.\n\nAlso should a business want to join in accepting Bitcoin and they are happy to go the Lightning route then they are also very likely to involve an exchange.  Like it or not most business will still have bills to pay in fiat so will want to exchange Bitcoin for $$ at some point and if an exchange offers both this service and access to the Lightning network then it's a one-stop-shop for them.  Since it takes time (blockchain confirmations) they are unlikely to want to open channels with customers directly.\n\nSo unless someone can shoot down the above then every day users and business are most likely to access the network via exchanges (mainly due to basic lazyness).  Exchanges will of course have channels open with each other effectivly resulting in every user and business being able to access each other via the exchanges acting as a sort of super-hubs.\n\nPlease, if anyone thinks something different would happen let me know.": 1, "There are three ways a channel can close; here are the transactions involved in each case:\n\n**1: cooperative close (best case)**\n\nAlice and Bob open a channel by cooperating to create the deposit transaction, signing a refund transaction that spends from the deposit transaction before they broadcast the deposit transaction.  All payments in the channel are manipulation of that refund transaction, which has two outputs (one sending money to Alice, one sending money to Bob).\n\nWhen they're ready to close the channel, Alice and Bob cooperate to finalize that refund transaction with the final balance in the channel.  They don't use CSV in those two final outputs because this is the final state of the channel, so they can start spending from it immediately (although they should wait for one or more confirmations just to be safe).\n\n*So this case is only two on-chain transactions.*\n\n**2: non-cooperative close with current state**\n\nAlice and Bob setup a channel as before, but at some point Bob disappears, so Alice decides to close the channel unilaterally.  She broadcasts the most recent state of the refund transaction which has two outputs, one to Bob and one to Alice.\n\nThe Hash Time Lock Contract (HTLC) is setup so that there are actually two unbroadcast transactions that represent the current balance state of any in-progress channel.  Alice has a transaction that pays two outputs with the following conditions:\n\n1. An output to Alice that is time locked for (say) 1,000 blocks using CSV but which can be spent after that time by Alice's signature, or which can be spent at any time by Bob's signature plus some data (a hash pre-image[1]) that Alice would have to reveal to Bob on the next payment within the channel.\n2. An output to Bob which can be spent at any time by Bob's signature.\n\nBob has a transaction that pays two outputs with the roles reversed:\n\n1. An output to Bob that is time locked for (say) 1,000 blocks using CSV but which can be spent after that time by Bob's signature, or which can be spent at any time by Alice's signature plus some data (a hash pre-image) that Bob would have to reveal to Alice on the next payment within the channel.\n2. An output to Alice which can be spent at any time by Alice's signature.\n\nAlice broadcasts the version of the contract in her possession, waits the 1,000 to give Bob a chance to chance to use the pre-image if he has it to claw back any wrongful close, and then she can spend the output at her leisure.  Bob can spend his output any time at his leisure, since the version of the transaction that Alice broadcast didn't use CSV to time lock his output.\n\n*So this case also uses two on-chain transactions.*\n\n**3: fraudulent close**\n\nAlice and Mallory open a channel the same way Alice and Bob did.  After each in-channel payment is finalized, Alice and Mallory each reveal to each other the pre-image to the hash lock that was used in the previous channel state, as describe in the bullets #1 above.\n\nMallory takes his chances and unilaterally closes the channel the same way Alice did above, but he closes it in an old state that was most advantageous to him.  Alice is monitoring the chain; she sees the attempt fraud and she uses the pre-image Mallory sent her in the state change after the one Mallory broadcast to spend his output to herself before the 1,000-block time lock expires.\n\nAlternatively, Alice isn't monitoring the chain, Mallory waits for the 1,000-block time lock to expire, and he spends his output to himself to prevent Alice from using the pre-image at some future time to claw back that money.\n\n*So in this case, there are three on-chain transactions.  However, hopefully this time lock-based anti-fraud system is effective enough that nobody bothers trying to steal other people's money, so all Lightning channels will involve two transactions (or fewer on average if channel close/open merges are used, but that's a different subject).*\n\n**Footnote**\n\n[1] In the original Lightning paper, they use private key reveals instead of hashes and pre-images, but after the publication of that paper, /u/rustyreddit figured out an [awesome way](https://github.com/rustyrussell/ccan/blob/master/ccan/crypto/shachain/design.txt) to use hashes to massively reduce the amount of data that needed to be stored in case the other party attempted fraud, and that's the design used in both Rusty's code and the [lnd code](https://github.com/LightningNetwork/lnd).": 3, 'You may have heard of the upcoming CheckSequenceVerify (CSV) soft fork; this is what Lightning uses to prevent the problem you\'re describing.\n\nIn order to open a channel with each other, Alice and Mallory create an on-chain transaction *deposit transaction* that pays money into a 2-of-2 multisig address where they each hold one key.  In order to prevent either of them from holding funds hostage, before they pay into that address, they create and sign a *refund transaction* that returns each person\'s deposit to them (minus the transaction fees).\n\nThe refund transaction (and all other regular transaction in the channel) includes as one of its conditions a CSV with a parameter of (for example) 1,500 blocks (about 1.5 weeks at 10 minutes per block).  That means that when the refund transaction is added to the blockchain, it can\'t be spent again for about 1.5 weeks.\n\nHowever, there\'s also an exception to this limitation, if you have proof the other person broadcast an old "balance sheet" and you also sign a transaction using the private key of the person who didn\'t broadcast the old balance sheet, you can spend from that refund transaction without waiting 1,500 blocks.\n\nSo when Mallory gets an old balance sheet added to the blockchain, Mallory has to wait 1,500 blocks before he can spend those bitcoins---but Alice (and only Alice) can sign a transaction that spends those bitcoins immediately.  As long as she does that before the 1,500 block limit, Mallory not only doesn\'t get the bitcoins he tried to steal but Alice also gets all the other bitcoins he deposited into the channel.  (This effective enforcement mechanism is why we hope attempted Lightning fraud will be very rare.)\n\nThis anti-fraud transaction that Alice creates is the same transaction as the bounty transaction in the text you quoted, but in that case Alice pre-signs the transaction and gives it to other people to broadcast when she knows she\'s not going to be around.\n\nOf course, if Mallory doesn\'t try to commit fraud and if he and Alice cooperate to close the channel in its latest state, they can create a final version of the refund/payment transaction that doesn\'t include CSV, allowing them to spend their final balances immediately.': 7, 'Thanks for the clarification.  So, good practice in this scenario would be to only open a channel once with an address.  If you ever want to close and reopen a channel for whatever reason, you would close the first then open a new channel with a separate address, correct?': 1, "The main problems with address reuse come from reusing it for multiple transactions. Since there is actually only one real blockchain transaction and the rest are obscured and exchanged privately out of the blockchain, that mitigates the problems of blockchain analysis. You can't analyze what you can't see. The security problem of address reuse is also mitigated because the address isn't really being reused as far as the Blockchain is concerned.\n\nThere remains an issue of private analysis, if you notice two sites have the same receiving address, well you can put it together that they are the same entity. You can make many channels to address that, but it would be limited by your capital since channels require capital. \n\nPossibly there could be a privacy improvement to use stealth addresses, but I'm not sure if that's feasible with the LN design\n": 4, 'I think the best practice would be to keep many channels open, like 10 or so, and swap between them as much as possible. You could close them and open new ones as often as you feel your privacy requires.\n\nThis would match what is already considered good practice for "donation" addresses: change them up when someone sends some funds to them. \n\nAnd yes don\'t reuse addresses for multiple Blockchain transactions, including the LN wallet deposits': 3, "OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY.

This is why I don\'t think many miners will actually shut down. \n\nHonestly I hope people believe this bullshit so I can keep buying BTC cheaper. The people parroting this shit are not involved in commercial Bitcoin mining.\n\n\nBut I will explain, for maybe the 20th time, the reasons this is absolutely not going to happen.\n\n\n1) Widely available current and previous generation Bitcoin mining equipment is extremely profitable over the cost of electricity (in most regions) and will continue to be so after the halving. For example, a previous generation Antminer S7 earns more than double what it costs in electricity today for most US locations. However, commercial mining in the US happens in places (like the state of Washington) where the cost of electricity is 1/5 to 1/10 the cost of average power consumption. This means that for these operations to shut down (as opposed to increasing deployments) Bitcoin will need to fall well under $200 per coin.\n\n\n2) A large number of commercial miners (especially in China) actually get electricity for free. They will continue mining no matter what happens to the exchange rate.\n\n\n3) A large number of commercial miners pre-purchase electricity for 6 and 12 month terms and will continue mining regardless of exchange rate because they are effectively locked in already.\n\n\n4) Bitcoin mining is so profitable that recent deployments (ie within the last six months) resulted in a recent tripling of network difficulty with full knowledge of the coming halvening.\n\n\n5) The only transactions that "get stuck" when blocks are full those paying inadequate fees. Users with wallets that predict correct fees have not had these issues. Its true that when there are a limited number of seats on the bus, some people won\'t get one no matter what they pay, however long chain analysis has indicated that Bitcoin likely has a lot of capacity at small average fees rates. In other words, blocks are very far from full at average transaction costs above $0.10\n\n\n6) A large number of users that had issues during the most recent "fee event" were using blockchain.info\'s wallet which was not correctly predicting necessary fees. Blockchain has since upgraded their software.\n\n\n7) Even if the exchange rate did tank, difficulty will readjust as it always has within two weeks. A new equilibrium would be found.\n\n\n8) And finally, if you still don\'t believe that there will not be a death spiral, here\'s the final kicker. When blocks fill up, transaction fees rise, ENCOURAGING MORE MINING.\n\n\n\n': 4, "It didn't result in any tangible demand for Bitcoin, the Greeks, Cypriots, Ukrainians etc have not adopted Bitcoin en mass or even a small percentage. \n\nIt's Incredibly sad that so many bitcoiners pray for financial doom for others to improve their own wealth": 1, "Bitcoin still had a high hashrate when the price was $160 last summer.  \n\nEven if the price remained the same at $420 / 2 (which I highly doubt, I fully expect it to go up), this would still be higher.  \n\nI don't think we are going to see a huge impact on mining after the halvening.
