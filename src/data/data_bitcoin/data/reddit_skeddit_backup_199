': 1, '[deleted]': 1, 'I listened to a couple lectures. Actually quite good.': 1, '> How does printing a $20 bill create actual money?\n\nEasy. Paper money is scarce because only one entity has permission to create it, and that entity is closely watched (at least in America). Scarce resources are inherently valuable.\n\nBitcoin is different because *anyone* can be a miner. If anyone could print their own paper money, it would drive the value of paper fiat into the ground. Maybe a better question would be "how does Bitcoin stay scarce in a digital, decentralized environment?"': -6, '~~Bitcoin~~Money is a system for maintaining a global record of who provided a valuable good or service to whom. Gold does that physically, dollars do that digitally and physically but with a central authority who can print more at will, and bitcoin does that completely digitally with no central authority and no one who can print more. \n\nActually miners can "print" more bitcoins but only what was scheduled to be printed anyway according to preset Bitcoin\'s inflation schedule. Miners just do extremely difficult math problems that make it very hard for anyone to mess with the ledger unless they have an overwhelming amount of processing power.': 2, "Yes, anyone can be a miner.\n\nWhether you're a *profitable* miner is a different question, but anyone can mine bitcoins.": 2, 'Money is generated when it\'s generated. Printing a note of fiat "generates" money.\n\nIt doesn\'t generate value though. The act of generating money in this way actually causes inflation, in that all the previously printed units are worth slightly less value.\n\nBitcoin, like all money, _represents_ value it doesn\'t _generate_ value. The work we all do in the economy generates value. We transfer some of that to our money by using it. Simply by trusting that $10 buys you $10 worth of goods or services gives it that value when you accept it in exchange for value you have provided to someone else. Same with Bitcoin.\n\nNow, bitcoin\'s advantage is that its creation is governed by an algorithm, not by the whims of a central bank controlled by a government. It is like an even stronger gold standard because there might always be a hidden supply of gold not yet found, that is impossible with Bitcoin, it\'s supply is fixed.\n\nThe math problems are solved as a way of locking-in the ledger at regular intervals. This means if you want to change the past (like reversing a transaction) you have to do more computational work than was done by the Bitcoin network did to create that "lock-in"; and you have to do it all on your own. That\'s not practical, so doesn\'t happen, and hence the Bitcoin ledger is essentially written in stone.\n\nThe actual math being done... You don\'t care. What is important is that it\'s the sort of problem that is hard to solve but easy to verify. That is to say that you do not have to repeat the work to see that an answer is the right one. This is what makes "why don\'t we do SETI or folding@home work?" suggestions invalid. Because the check for correctness by the rest of us would require us to redo all the work -- which is impossible.  The analogy I like for proof-of-work systems is finding a piece of a jigsaw ... finding the piece is hard (you have to search a large number of pieces), verifying a piece is the "correct" one is trivial (you just try it out).  Every bitcoin block is a new jigsaw, with a new box of pieces.\n\nEdit: grammar.': 13, 'All your questions will answered:\nBitcoin 101 Blackboard Series: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzctEq7iZD-7-DgJM604zsndMapn9ff6q': 4, 'Asking about Bitcoin is a bit like asking " What is truth"-----Whole libraries have been written about them.

': 0, '>  What sort of math problems are we solving? \n\nFinding a checksum (hash value) for a block of transactions, so that anyone can check that their copy of the transaction history is the same as everyone else\'s.  It\'s making a secure record.  Blocks also include the hash value of the previous block.  So if a change to an old transaction is made, the hash of the block it is in will no longer match the value recorded in the next block.  So not only is the current record secured, all past records are also secured.\n\nDigital data that nobody can mess with is the great invention in Bitcoin.\n\n> How does it generate ACTUAL money? \n\nPaper money dollars are generated by debt backing at the Federal Reserve, mostly Treasury bonds and agency mortgage securities.  In effect they are merely debts in convenient round amounts.\n\nBitcoin gets its value a different way, by being useful.  So it is more similar to a car or a lumber 2x4.  Things that are useful don\'t need backing by something else.  But the usefulness of Bitcoin is not just the entries in the transaction history (blockchain).  It is the entire Bitcoin Network of custom hardware, network nodes, software, apps, exchanges, stores and users.  The network is what enables you to make new transactions and therefore move value from person to person.  The total of all the current entries is fairly fixed - transactions only move them from one address to another.  The value per unit entry (a bitcoin, as the unit of account) then depends mostly on demand for them at any given time, vs the supply available from sellers.\n\n> HOW does it work?\n\nIt works because of decentralized trust.  The blockchain (transaction history) is secured in such a way that no single person can muck with the contents, and new transactions can only be made with a private cryptographic key.  So you can trust that a balance you have now will still be there in the future.  In monetary terms this makes it a "store of value".  Because new bitcoins are created on a finite and predictable schedule, you don\'t have to worry about inflation, unlike central banks who can make more currency whenever they feel like it.  Bitcoins are scarce, and will remain scarce.\n\nThe mechanics of how the network works is that new transactions are broadcast across the peer-to-peer network of nodes.  Each node checks the transactions against the past history, to make sure the sender had funds to send, plus other technical checks, like digital signature is correct.  If a transaction fails any check, it does not get passed along.  Each node is checking against its own copy of the blockchain, so no single malicious faker can get very far.  Miners are also nodes, and check incoming transactions.  But they also try and solve the block hash, because they get 25 (currently) new bitcoins if they do.  Then all the other nodes verify the new block is good, and remove the included transactions from their "memory pool" of "new transactions that are good, but not yet in a block".': 1, 'Even if bitcoin dies tommorow it still forces people to read up on economic theories, money, trade, computer science, politics etc. \n\nBitcoin, if nothing else, is a superb educational and eye opening tool.

How does printing a $20 bill create actual money?  Well, it does because people put trust in it and value it, and are willing to trade their goods and services for it, because they know other people trust it and accept it too.  It has value because we all put our collective shared faith in it.\n\nBitcoin is no different in that respect.  The main difference is how it's issued.  It's not a printed piece of paper.  It's essentially an entry on a digital ledger which is collectively maintained by the public, and anyone can participate and help verify the honesty of the system.  That's where mining comes into it, but it's really not that necessary to understand the technical points behind mining to understand that bitcoin is money.": 59, 'Only miners solve math problems, that were arbitrarily selected to be slow to solve but fast to verify.\n\nThe reason math problems are required is because Bitcoin is a single record of transaction history and the math problem provides a way to stop random people from editing the record.\n\nOnly people who commit serious resources can edit the transaction history record and they prove their commitment through the solving of the problems.\n\nBecause the miners who solve the problems have spent a lot of money to solve them, they are incentivized to not do bad things, and based on that, you can trust their additions to the transaction record. \n\n': 3, "miners roll the dice with idle cpu time to get a winning hash(a hash < a certain number) of valid signed transactions into a blockchain to prevent people from re-spending the coins in their account. The more powerful hashing devices can roll more frequently increasing their odds of winning.\n\nAll coins have come from winners of the rolls, originally they had no value until someone gave them value(fractions of a penny) by buying a pizza in return for 10000 coins. Once it had value ppl begain to trade it and supply and demand took it's value up to what it is today.": 1, 'Take this free course.\n\nhttps://www.coursera.org/course/bitcointech': 14, 'Money is a difficult concept to grasp in general. Once you can fully grasp and understand what money and value are, it becomes easier to understand why Bitcoin is money.\n\nAt the very fundamental level, money is a way to represent value. Value is a very human construct. A dog would value a doggy treat way more than it would a gold bar for instance. However I should say that *realized value* is entirely dependent on human *culture*, and so obviously what humans value can and often does change over time.\n\nSo I do work that someone values. The person whom I do work for gives me a token that represents that value (i.e. dollars). What has happened is both parties (employer and employee) have basically come to an agreement that what I get paid is a fair wage for the work that I do. In reality you probably wish you got paid more, so this means you either ask for a raise or seek a better paying job. So if you\'re still continuing to work for a lower wage, you are essentially agreeing to it (even if you don\'t like it), because ultimately you\'ve decided that it\'s better than getting paid nothing at all. But I digress.\n\nSo you get tokens (dollars) for doing work, and these tokens can be spent on things or services provided by others who have also done work. I buy an apple from the grocery store? Work was done to harvest that apple and bring it closer to me. I pay the electricity bill to power my computer? Work was done to generate that electricity and bring it to my house. If I value these things, I pay for them at a price I deem to be fair. Using tokens is an efficient way to trade and transfer value. Because I don\'t think the utility company accepts goats as payment.\n\nBitcoin uses a technology called "the blockchain" which you should really think of as a giant Excel spreadsheet showing where these tokens of value are sent since the beginning of Bitcoin. That\'s right. Every financial transaction in the decentralized global ledger that is the blockchain is an entry into the uncounterfeitable database since the beginning of Bitcoin. Every entry refers to another one and goes all the way back. This is the math problem we are solving. Miners perform a mathematical function called "hashing" that lump all transactions into a block, and that block refers to a previous block, and the previous block refers to the block before it and so on. Hashing works in that you cannot change one single bit of data in the blockchain without invalidating the entire thing. So I mathematically cannot try to edit the blockchain to make it say I own 1 million bitcoins instead of just 2. Such a forgery is rejected by consensus (miners and full nodes who verify the blockchain will ignore invalid entries and therefore render the alternate blockchain that you tried to forge as unrecognized and worthless).\n\nSo the only way to make a valid entry into the blockchain is to mine it according to the rules that the majority of the ecosystem agrees to. But say you control 60% of the hashing power. Then theoretically you could make up your own rules and do something nefarious. Fortunately miners all compete against each other to solve a block, and they are paid in Bitcoin for their work. Computationally it works out that it\'s easier and more profitable for miners to behave honestly and protect the blockchain rather than to try and attack it, and since they are paid and invested in the bitcoin ecosystem, they have a vested interest in not attacking the network.\n\nIf you want to learn more about the workings of Bitcoin, definitely learn more about proof of work, read Satoshi\'s white paper, and watch as many videos as you can. Khan Academy has some pretty good videos about Bitcoin, even if they are somewhat dated.': 1, '>If the price ever falls too low, miners will stop mining and the lack of supply should drive prices up again (unless people lose interest in using Bitcoin).\n\nThis is a common misconception. The amount of hashing power (i.e. number of active miners) only has a very limited influence on supply, because thanks to difficulty readjusting approximately every ~2weeks, the supply will automatically revert to its current 3,600 BTC daily average (1800 after the next halving in July 2016).': 1, "It's not a get rich quick scheme.

These nerds kind of decided there shall only ever be 21 million coins, and now we're kinda stuck with it. Which is great!\n\n> What sort of math problems are we solving? And why?\n\nNone. It's just a bunch of dumb computers doing dumb calculations a gazillion times a second that are utterly useless. Because they are utterly useless, they are super useful to the Bitcoin network, which uses it as an objective measure of a cost commitment to the continuation on top of a 'best' chain / current state of the distributed ledger. By making such a commitment and accidentally finding a valid block you are rewarded newly undusted money by everyone else.\n\nMining: http://srv1.yogh.io/#mine:last": 1, 'Hava a read of this non-technical FAQ: https://multibit.org/faq.html': 1, "Scarce, useful, and necessary (you can only pay tax in $, and if you don't you go to jail).": 0, 'Think of bitcoins like a digital version of seashells, which in ancient times were often used as money.    \n    \nThe bitcoins themselves are the actual money because they are 1) useful (as a medium of exchange in a global value transfer system that is owned by no one), and 2) because they are limited in number, like collectibles (but still sufficiently divisible with 8 places behind the decimal point).    \n    \nRemember also World-of-Warcraft gold and items became valuable and were traded on ebay, i.e. in the real world, for real money, but the problem with those is their supply is still controlled by a single organization (Blizzard Inc.). The supply of bitcoins is not controlled by any single organization, it is rather defined in its protocol that all bitcoin nodes that every user can run adhere to.\n\nSo, usefulness and scarcity are the requirements for any good to become valuable, no matter if in the analog or digital world. And once something is valuable, it may be traded to and fro other valuable things and moneys, hence you get the exchange value against USD, EUR etc.': 1, 'This confused me as well, so while it\'s already been explained well and in much detail, perhaps I can put it in a different way if it\'s still unclear to you. Obviously I\'m not an expert and I\'m just describing how I understand it so far from a big picture perspective.\n\nI think the main confusion (at least in my case) is/was to think that these math problems are actually useful and thus miners are "earning" money from somebody who values those computing resources to solve their math problems. Like SETI@home or something.\n\nThat is of course not the case. The math problems have no value in itself other than to require an investment of resources. The purpose is only to ensure that being part of the network that verifies Bitcoin transactions requires an investment of resources, so no single source can falsify the records.\n\nSo you could argue that the mining network is "wasting" a massive amount of computing resources world wide, but the value that is generated from it is a rock solid and trustworthy ledger of Bitcoin transactions. Since miners are compensated for their efforts in Bitcoin, this is where the tangible value of Bitcoin comes from.\n\nMiners trade the Bitcoin they generate for other value (e.g. fiat money) which should at least match the expense of mining it. We users buy Bitcoin because we value the trustworthiness of the ledger and resulting convenience of using Bitcoin to trade with each other. So arguably the objective value of Bitcoin is more or less how much it costs to mine one (plus a reasonable profit margin). If the price ever falls too low, miners will stop mining and the lack of supply should drive prices up again (unless people lose interest in using Bitcoin). If the price goes too high it becomes speculative and is likely to balance itself out again over time.': 1, 'If you have bitcoin you can buy stuff with it, thats all i know.

Bitcoin is infinitely better than crayons since it's impossible to counterfeit, you can keep it forever without it rotting, and you can send it instantly for almost no cost.\n": 0, "What do you mean by actual money?

Also, suppose that the only way to know what the output will be, is to actually run the input through the machine.

Without any offense I strongly recommend you taking some introductory microeconomics course (there a few very good MOOCs as well). ': 1, 'Yes I was being sarcastic. \n\nMy point of view is that bitcoin\'s limited supply is nothing at all to be concerned about. First, each bitcoin is divisible to 8 decimal points, so if deflation were to occur, prices could easily adjust. No problem. Secondly, and more to the point, deflation per se isn\'t a bad thing. Gradually falling prices are the hallmark of a growing economy, wherein the stock of available goods and services increase relative to the money supply. This is precisely what happened during the latter decades of the 19th century, which was one of the most stable periods in US economic history.\n\nI am aware of the ever present fear of deflation in economists and policy makers, but I don\'t buy it. Steady inflation hasn\'t brought about stability, as the economy has been more prone to the business cycle under the fed\'s control than under prior regimes. But just theoretically, one of the critiques of deflation is that it will cause people to delay purchases in order to benefit more from expected future lower prices. While this is undoubtedly true in some cases, I don\'t see why this is a problem. Moore\'s Law has been well established for decades, but millions of people nevertheless buy computers and related technology every year, even though they know they can get more bang for their buck if they wait another year. So the idea that people need to be goaded into consuming by eroding the value of their currency is completely wrongheaded.\n\nReally though, there\'s a deeper problem. The idea that people need to be herded into spending rather than saving betrays an utter lack of understanding of the way an economy grows. The circular flow model implies that dollars sloshing around the economy is the source of growth, making not spending money pretty much pointless. But the truth is that a healthy level of genuine savings engenders genuine investment, which is the source of economic growth, the result of which is higher incomes and consumption. But production has to come first. In short, capital accumulation in the economy is the prerequisite of sustainable growth, since capital accumulation leads to investment leads to better capital goods leads to more productivity leads to more physical stuff produced at lower cost leads to lower prices. The policy lever of inflation is an attempt by bankers and politicians to goad people into spending their money. \n\nIt\'s because of this misunderstanding of the economy that people think a deflationary currency would be bad for economic growth. It\'s not. Who it\'s bad for is governments, who to quote Keynes resent the "golden handcuffs" of sound money. Governments love paper money because they can print up whatever they need whenever they want. Or to be more modern, add zeros to their own accounts. They love the lack of accountability paper money gives them. But inflationary policy is a stealthy way of robbing the population of its purchasing power. It\'s a modern version of the ancient kingly practice of debasing gold currency by adding base metals, and pocketing the extra gold for the royal coffers. Obviously they don\'t justify inflationary currencies in this way. They talk about the need for flexibility by appealing to a faulty understanding of economic history. They blame the 29 crash on the idea of gold money,  for example, despite the fact that the federal reserve increased the money supply a massive amount throughout the 1920s, well beyond gold reserves. The crash that followed was essentially the result of the foregoing credit expansion, but most people just look at the fact that gold was involved somehow and assume that was the cause of the problem. This is incorrect. \n\nSo a tldr would be, deflationary currencies are perfectly capable of servicing a modern, worldwide economy, and doubly so for bitcoin, which is divisible to the infinitesimal satoshi.': 2, 'And divisibility has nothing to do with predictability.': 1, 'No, disinflation is fundamentally different.

A common myth is that the developers are in control of Bitcoin via authority, which has potentially serious, negative, legal/regulatory consequences to us. For instance in many jurisdictions people who have authority/control of money transfer systems also have significant legal obligations, e.g. to prevent fraud, reimburse losses, and meet KYC/AML obligations; I've personally spoken to people, including regulators, at fintech conferences who believed that the Bitcoin developers have these kinds of obligations and should act accordingly.\n\nHaving well-known and viable alternative implementations of the protocol helps make it clear that developers simply write software - the Bitcoin community chooses to use that software, and always has the option of choosing not to use it. Of course, there are many complex issues around coercion due to economic and mining power- your bitcoins are worthless if no-one accepts them and/or mines them - but those coercive forces do not directly originate from the developers themselves. A regulator trying to change the Bitcoin system by forcing developers to release software with code that behaves against the wishes of the Bitcoin community will most likely fail, because the community will not chose to run that software; the only power a developer like myself can wield is my skill at writing C++, writing English, and a few thousand twitter followers.": 123, 'Fool, bitcoin will no longer have a community once mass acceptance peeks through.

P2Pool uses a share chain, similar to bitcoin's block chain, except that instead of transactions the share chain tracks shares that are paid out in BTC when the pool finds the next block. The shares are paid directly to the miners address in the generation transaction. \n\nHere is an example: https://chainquery.com/bitcoin-api/getrawtransaction/93105b55bc7df25fd4203028e302c1d557e1346d3f280344064d8f54089b7d5a/1\n\nIn this case the shares that were paid were spit between 237 miners on P2Pool, each of whom had at least 1 valid share in the share chain.\n\nThis share chain currently includes a maximum of 8,640 valid shares that are paid when a block is found. Therefore a theoretical maximum of 8,640 miners can be paid per found block, in practice (as shown above) the number of paid miners is far less.\n\nTLDR: Because miners are paid in a trust-less manner, directly from the generation transaction, no one ever has custody of the coin except the miner who held the shares.

It's convenient to have digital currency to pay for things online, to pay with your power rather than your privacy. \n\nWe know that convenience has economic value, because time has economic value. That's been established in other domains at large scale -- wait time greatly influences whether someone calls an Uber, page load speed greatly influences whether someone visits a site, and checkout complexity greatly influences whether someone buys something from an ecommerce site.
