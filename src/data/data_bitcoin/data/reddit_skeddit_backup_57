Nodes can\r\nleave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the proof-of-work chain as proof of what\r\nhappened while they were gone. They vote with their CPU power, expressing their acceptance of\r\nvalid blocks by working on extending them and rejecting invalid blocks by refusing to work on\r\nthem.

"Ordering" is the important verb here.

Givens are that the transactions must be valid and they must be packaged into valid blocks in the process.\n\nIf there is a dispute the rule is that the length (total amount of work) of VALID chains is the tie breaker.\n\nThat is nakamoto consensus: consensus on the order of valid transactions.

If all your satoshis are there you can continue with moving the rest.  \n- You can save that piece of paper with those 12 words, or remember them (is not hard if you train your brain), or put the words into a picture (and only you know the order).\nOptional:  \n- Once you have all your coins into Electrum wallet, encrypt the wallet (put a password that you will always remember and not an easy one). That password will be used only when you send coins from that wallet.  \n- When the wallet file is encrypted, you can copy it to another USB stick and save that stick in a safe place. You always can open that file anytime without recovering from your passphrase. That file can be opened later in any version of Electrum wallet: desktop Windows/Linux/Tails or mobile. But remember that will be encrypted with that password you created.  \n- The USB with the wallet file can be also encrypted with Bitlocker from Windows 7 Ultimate, so every time you try to read that USB will ask you a password. So even if somebody finds your USB or you lost it, they can\'t open it.  \n- Always make 2-3 copies of that wallet file or those 12 words passphrase.

The bulk of your BTC should still be locked in cold storage.\n\nSecond reason:\n\nThe Lightning Network has problems with exchanging significant amounts of value.  For the Lightning Network to function, it requires that users and businesses lock up as much bitcoin as they would ever expect to transact over a given period of time.  For the micro-transaction use case, this isn\xe2\x80\x99t a big deal.  Locking up $5 or $10 worth of value is obviously not a problem.  However, if you wanted to \xe2\x80\x98only open one channel every six months\xe2\x80\x99, as the Lightning Network slide deck suggests is a \xe2\x80\x98reasonable use case\xe2\x80\x99, things begin to fall apart.  For someone to only open one Lightning Network channel every six months, would mean that channel would have to lock up the maximum amount of value the user would ever hold over that period of time.  First of all, this would require a level of trust in the network which I have already noted will take a long time to achieve.  Second, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem practical that in a world where people get their paychecks roughly, on average, every two weeks, that they would be ready, willing, or able to lock up all of the funds they might want to use for a six month period.  You essentially have to think of the Lightning Network as a pre-paid debit card.  You have to fund it up front, you have to guess how much you are going to need, and whenever you run out, you are going to have to top it off again.  There is no scenario where it seems practical that people will only want to open a single channel once every six months.\nhttp://codesuppository.blogspot.ca/2016/02/the-lightning-network-is-so-great-that.html?m=1\n': 1, 'Thanks for info.

A smart contract enforcement does not depend on what you do with your money, nor which juridiction you are in, and does not cost lawyer to enforce.\n\nThe low cost for being protected is what make crypto currencies attractive, and why it started being adopted on black market. The most expensive place to defend yourself is the black market. White market is next.": 5, 'Coinbase solves the scalability problem exactly like the legacy banking system does: It requires you to entrust your money to a service provider which allows them to keep a ledger for their user accounts. Moving money between any two accounts turns into a database edit. This scales very well obviously, but makes you completely dependent on the service provider.\n\nLightning Network solves the scalability problem by adding a "contract layer" on top of the blockchain. Any two nodes will be able to create a shared fund of which they can re-negotiate the allotment among themselves. No third party is needed as long as they can agree. When a disagreement occurs or one tries to take advantage of the other, either node can execute the latest agreement as a regular Bitcoin transaction on the blockchain. This scales better than the pure blockchain approach, because while transactions happen as renegotiation of payout slices it generates no load on the blockchain whatsoever. It can however not be decoupled from the blockchain as the execution on the blockchain is equivalent to getting a "court ruling" on the contract: It\'s required as a fallback to enforce fair behavior. Facilitated by [hashed timelock contracts](http://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/q/43184/5406) you can create "multi hop payments" through your business partner to reach business partners of your business partner. The fear of "centralization" for LN comes from the idea that business partners with lots of connections will be more useful to span a network, and therefore there will be a small number of extremely well connected nodes through which most payments will be channeled. This is a suboptimal situation, but much less problematic than full counterparty risk as in the Coinbase scenario. It also might be mitigated when each node has at least four payment channels to other nodes.\n\nI\'ve recently posted this answer to "ELI5 Lightning Network?": https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/48o99y/the_dream_of_buying_a_coffee_with_bitcoin_is/d0lu9gj\n\nYou might find it interesting if you want to better understand what Lightning is and how it works\n': 5, 'You will be able to write them off your taxes for as long as you live and declare capital gains.': 1, 'as soon as OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY is deployed I would expect to see centralized payment channels between all the major shared custody wallet providers and bitpay etc.. that will free up alot of capacity onchain.': 7, "You're asking if centralized and decentralized aren't on a scale instead of being absolutes.
