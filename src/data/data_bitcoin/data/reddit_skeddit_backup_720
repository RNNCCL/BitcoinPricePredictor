However, understand that if there is provable documentation between you and your friend (emails, chat logs, etc) that good ole \'regular factual evidence\' could be used against you to prove that you sent said 500 btc to your friend.

': 1, 'There are several solutions.  At this point we are no where near hitting that cap, but you are correct that if a large retailer came online we\'d have to make an adjustment.  Currently we can do about 600k tranactions an hour (@ 7 tps). we could increase the block size and/or increase the block frequency.  \n\nThe block size is the easiest  one and would most likely be the initial solution.  The limitation there would be physical memory on the servers constructing blocks (mining pools, etc).  currently I believe the block size is a 1 MB, so we got plenty of wiggle room on that front.  My server runs 32 GB of ram with room to upgrade.\n\nThe next solution would be the block frequency.  This would require lowering difficulty adjusting the reward so the payout is the same (25 btc per 6 minutes on average).  This solution would be a bit more work, but wouldn\'t require major overhauls to the protocol or the data structure and would most likely be the second course of action.  Assuming competence in the code, we should easily be able to break the 500 - 2000 TPS.\n\nLastly, would be parallel processing of the block chain and, most likely, wouldn\'t be utilized until we hit the practical limits of commodity hardware.  This would be the most "expensive" change to the code base.  We would have to switch from a "Chain" (basically a linked list, currently we link the next block to the previous block via the hash) to a tree structure and partition the data processing so that each branch handles a range of transaction by hash signature.  Due to random nature of hashing algorithms, this would create an overall even distribution of transactions across multiple branches of a tree.  This technique of branching would allow each branch to be processed in parallel and scale the network in a N-Tier style.  The limits here would be bandwidth and storage and far beyond even what credit card companies have ever seen.  Done properly, we could achieve tens of thousands of transactions per second.\n\nI\'m sure there are other "creative" solutions available out there, but this is how I personally would scale the network, if left up to me.  I hope this helps easy any anxiety about the scalability of the blockchain.

Which encourages consumers to use it. And that drives demand for merchants to accept it. \n\nThat is true, but there are other and imo better mechnisms for consumer protection than the credit fraud protection model, such as the fact that you have to authorize every purchase, and a its not possible for anyone to "pull" funding from you.  This feature of bitcoin alone virtually obviates the need for credit card fraud protection in common F2F in-store sales. For internet sales, merchant can offer refunds, and 3rd parties can offer escrow/arbitration, and at far lower rates than credit cards charge. \n \nThere are other factors as well, which I think eradicate the business model driven by the ability to print debt; if the credits cards offer hard current it cannot be fractionally reserved if those with accounts choose not to leave deposits in trust. Much of the risk mitigation in instant credit derives from the imaginary nature of the money at put risk. If hard currency has to be placed in jeopardy of default, the lendor can quickly find themselves insolvent.\n\nThe marginal cost to verifyably withdraw cash or gold is quite high. The marginal cost to verifiably withdraw bitcoin is none or very low. When there is no downside, depositors will choose to withdraw, I suspect. Most especially if there is any hint of a crisis or shortfall. \n\nSo, while I do think there will be bitcoin credit cards, I think they will likely be for OBC micro-payments only. I think their margins will be far thinner.

Oil is consumed to produce energy, gold is used in industry and jewelry, etc.  They have a base value set by the demand of their uses.  \n\nBitcoins are not consumed in that way.  There is no industry that uses this particular hash with N leading zeroes for other purposes.  It's only valuation process is in the hopes of selling for as much or more.  This can be short-term sustained when there are just-so stories circulated about how it will replace all currencies and purchases now will be worth millions in the future and people believe that.  There are always going to be people that can be told stories.\n\nBut the truth is that no industry or finance sector will give people value for doing nothing.  Giving away trillions of dollars of worth for no reason just doesn't happen.  If the technology appears useful, they will make a copy - maybe thousands of copies - of the technology, each with their own blockchain, and transfer wealth freshly without increasing the value of hodlers.  Clearly, increased transactions do not cause increased valuation today, as all research and easy verification shows.\n\nAnd once people have been burned enough, and the repeated stories of bubbles bursting gets repetitive, the value of the commodity will equilibriate at it's base value.  And that base is close to zero.": 1, "Your understanding of the theory of value is quite mistaken.  I cannot spend a lot of time educating you on this, but I can offer some guidelines if you truly have any interest.\n\nJewelry, art, etc. have value because of psychological drives for aesthetic things.  All value is psychological, but not all value is due to aesthetic drives (some come from hunger drives, or fear drives, or sex drives, or drives to feel appreciated, etc.).  Aesthetic works are still _consumed_, though.  Upon having them, they satisfy the drive.\n\nAll modern economic schools agree on that, whether they be neoclassical, Austrian, post-Keynsian, Neo-Ricardianism, etc.  There is so much research validating this that it is canon pretty much everywhere.  Trillion dollar industries like marketing depend on this.\n\nSo how do you know whether something is _consumed_ versus _held for speculation_?  Economic research looks to the behavior of those who purchased the commodity.  What triggers sells?  Sell volume that increases near peaks (or causes peaks) and similarly increases towards extended lulls has speculative character, whereas that which stays fairly correlated to the demand indicators signal drive value.\n\nThere are statistical ways to extract these two components and follow them over time.  Gold and oil obviously have speculative components - most commodities do.  But they also clearly have base valuation from their consumption.  The world would stop much critical functioning without oil.  Hunger, heating, and numerous other drives would not be met at current demand.  You can see gold base value in the necklaces, earings, wedding rings, teeth adornment, and numerous other items that are bought simply for aesthetic appreciation, and which are not sold off at peaks or extended lulls but instead follow cycles of ownership tied to the people whose drives they satisfy.  That decoupled background activity, which actually exceeds speculative use considerably, is crucial to providing a bottom when gold bubbles burst (which they do).  15% of all gold mined each year is consumed in industry, which is quite significant to it's value as well as well.\n\nFinally, as to your comment on mining and value, you seemed to have again not understood what I was saying.  Sure, miners will get value (for now) from Bitcoin.  But that has nothing to do with the economy moving to completely use Bitcoin, so all transaction value moving over, meaning the total transaction span of the world being now accomodated by Bitcoin, which spread across the limited supply means that even 1 bitcoin is hundreds of thousands of dollars (which is the argument people sell to try to pump Bitcoin).  To do that, industry would have to put that valuation into the total worth, but they wouldn't receive most of that value.  Instead that would be transferred to the hodlers.  And nobody will do that.  Never.  It's laughable.

Tax treatment of cryptocurrency as property does not account for the substantial illiquidity and highly limited acceptance and use of cryptocurrency, and substantially and unfairly discourages taxpayers engaging in a trade or business from using cryptocurrency in commerce. This circumstance is likely to discourage economic activity and stifle innovation and growth. At present, a taxpayer accepting cryptocurrency for goods or services will be taxed on the fair market value of the cryptocurrency despite the fact that exchange rates (from cryptocurrency to conventional currency) are both highly volatile and published or available only on a small number of proto-exchanges in the early stages of development, acceptance and awareness by cryptocurrency users. As a result, current tax treatment will measure income on the basis of an illiquid and likely inaccurate fair market value that exceeds the taxpayer\xe2\x80\x99s true fair market value and hence income, resulting in the risk of a consistent overtaxation or overpayment that will act as a strong deterrent to or penalty for accepting cryptocurrency in payment. Such tax treatment is inconsistent with the tax treatment of secured notes for payment in trade or commerce, which recognizes a discount from the face value of the note due to the illiquid nature of the payment.

So we agreed not to publish the idea.\n\nThe problem is these attacks are actually quite possible to defend against, for instance by requiring miners to provide their real identity. This can be easily done, for instance with a facebook logon. Small pools can't easily do those kinds of Sybil attacks, yet they're still vulnerable to people with more resources who can, so the end result gives big advantages to larger pools and large solo mining operations. (IE the extremely harmful hosted mining like CEX.io) There's also a lot of subtle ways to detect block withholding attacks - ways that the authors of this paper aren't aware of because they're kept jealously secret.

He used it to receive some sort of prize in his behalf.": 3, "For those interested, here is an ELI5 as to what a block withholding attack is.\n\n\nFirst some context; if you understand how mining pools work you can skip this paragraph. Mining bitcoin blocks is really hard, because the crypto challenge everyone is trying to solve deliberately has a high difficulty so that only one person in the world solves it every ten minutes. Since there are many many miners, this makes it very unlikely that any one miner will get a block in any period of time. In fact, it is entirely possible that their mining equipment won't find a single block in its useful lifetime. No Payouts at all! The solution is pools, where miners join together and use their combined computational power to try to solve the same problem. The pool, with its large hashing/mining power finds blocks more frequently than any individual miner would have done. When to pool finds a block, the profits are distributed between the miners. Yay! But to do this fairly, the pool operator needs to share the profit proportionally to how much mining power people were devoting to the pool. How do they know this? When the miners are trying to solve the pool's problem, they will keep getting answers that are somewhat right, but not completely there. It takes effort/work to get these dud answers, but they aren't proper block solutions. However, these dud answers can be used as proof to the pool operator that you've been trying super hard to find a block for the pool. When (very rarely) a miner DOES find the correct answer to the crypto problem, the miner hands it over to the pool operator, the pool gets the block reward, profits are shared an everyone is happy. Hurrah!\n\nA block withholding attack is where a miner (or mining entity, shh) offers up the dud answers to get the rewards, but, if they actually get the correct answer for a block, they don't hand it over to the pool operator. Doing this is not directly profitable top the miner - the answer is specific to the pool - but if blocks are regularly being withheld from a pool, profits are being shared with people who aren't really contributing. The profitability of that pool then falls, because less is paid out for a given amount of effort/work/dud answers. If the profitability of a pool is lower, people will switch pools.\n\nPossible reasons for doing this include:\n* a pool screwing a rival pool in a dastardly manner\n* a miner punishing a 'bad' pool\n* (arguably) to damage bitcoin\n* Some people just want to watch the world burn\n\nIs it worth posting this in a git glossary somewhere anyone?

Game theory assumes market actors will inevitably and immediately perceive the nature and existence of the game; and thus act like game theoreticians, which is rarely the case; and if study of complex systems teaches us anything, it is that they by nature find ways to change or get around the "rules" of whatever game is constraining the achievement of value. i.e. prisoner\'s dilemma\'s aren\'t witnessed often in real life, because the prisoners will almost always find some way to communicate or otherwise disrupt the constraints which leave them with such stark and risky choices.\n\n/u/changetip 1 mBTC': 3, 'Are you saying there has never been a proven block witholding attack by a large hashrate miner ?': 4, "Lots of services use it as such; doesn't have to be perfect, just has to be good enough.": 1, "Woah really?

Sunday here, so a little slow to respond.\n\nIn my earlier response I was specifically referring to IOS and Android provisioning, code signing and app signature verification processes, which check the signature of an app and verify it and its code match before running it. This not the same as saying that malware apps could not be installed on a phone and do malicious things but it does say that the app is unmodified from what its signature says. Sandboxing protects one App from another, so malware apps cannot in theory attack another running app ( that maybe an ongoing battle depending on APIS leveraged ). \n\nNow, lets take the most recent IOS malware as examples. WireLurker & Masque. A pretty big wakeup call for Apple, but in practice not that dangerous. Both require the theft and use of an enterprise provisioning profile to work. Something thats just not that easy to get a hold of.\n\nWirelurker has the ability to load malicious apps via USB from OSX, if the user was dumb enough to download an OSX app from non apple App store. Its a pretty sophisticated attack, and is a big risk to data stored on the iPhone thats accessible to all apps over APIs, like contacts for example. But it cannot impersonate our APP, or extract data from our secure store. I also believe this particular door has been closed.\n\nNow the Masque attack in theory is EXACTLY the situation you are concerned about. In this case a url distributed through a phi-sing attack could download and install a replacement APP for one already installed using the same bundle identifier. This requires an enterprise provisioning certificate, but while it can replace a legitimate app with a pretender, the app still needs to be signed, and the signature is still verified when the app starts.\nSome good reads on these two issues are here.\nhttp://goo.gl/jHlc9o\nhttp://goo.gl/QQ9z0g\n\nNeither of these situations are dangerous to BitStash or the funds it secures, or can be used to perform the attack you describe, because, we have our own provisioning, signing & verification process on both the desktop app, mobile app and indeed the device itself, when the app is authorized initially with BitStash. The code is, hashed and the result sent to the BitStash with every signed message as part of the OTPassword. It makes App updates more cumbersome, but guarantees security. So a Masque impersonator would just not produce the right hash, and as such would not be able to send / receive messages to/from BitStash.\n\ndskloet,  In reality, the problem we are trying to solve for is malware automated draining of a wallet. Our 2FA approach solves for this, by requiring a HUMAN enter a code displayed on one device, into another much like a WebWallet like GreenAddress , we just have the added benefit of an additional physical COLOR CAPTCHA and verification of transaction details on another device.\n\ndskloet, last point. I know enough to know, there is much I do not know. I think we have an incredibly easy to use and secure solution, especially in the IOS8 fingerprint 2fa use case, its just easy, yet totally secure.  But I would be delighted to incorporate community feedback, guidance and direction. There is no Screen on BitStash, or Buttons, because I wanted a workflow that was familiar to users, that fit within the expectations of the average person used to using PayPal or checking out on Amazon, that competed with the workflow of a coinbase, blockchain.info, greeenAddress, but did not have the risks associated with using a third party. \n\nLet me know if there are any other questions I can answer for you.\n': 1, "> getting mind share is incredibly difficult\n\nEspecially when you don't post any links to further information.\n\nI'm not going to google it; it takes less energy to write a snarky comment.": 2, "Also, I'm in China.

Captcha never loads > can't solve it > can't get to your site.\n\n:-(": 1, 'Hey dskloet, no thats not possible, for a couple of reasons\n\n1) Mobile apps are signed and verified when executed. Here is a primer on IOS code signing verification http://reverse.put.as/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/syscan11_breaking_ios_code_signing.pdf. So at least on a NON Jailbroken phone, IOS apps cannot be modified in the way you describe. The story with android phones has not been so good, but the last major vulnerabilities found (masterKey and Fastboot ) were patched in April 2014, and are fully rolled out to new phones. Obviously the situation is different on desktops, especially windows, which is why all this 2FA guff has to be done in the first place.\n\n2) As I said in the prior post, point 1. All messages to / from BitStash are signed and verified. This signature independently verifies the sending application and the content of the message. The signing key is AES encrypted with the users PIN PBKDF2 extended 2000 rounds. So while malware could potentially script our desktop UI, for instance on Windows, or cause a BIP70 payment protocol click ( the biggest threat we think ) it cannot programmatically create a transaction to send to BitStash via code. So what is on both screens is what is being requested.\n\nNot sure if you understand ProtocolBuffer definitions, but this is how the txSign message looks\n\nmessage iSignTxRequest {\n\textend InMessage {\n    \toptional iSignTxRequest iSignTxRequest = 105; // Unique extension number\n\t}\n\trequired OTPassword otp = 1;\n\trequired string accountId = 2;\n\trequired txNetwork network = 3;\n\trepeated txClaim claims = 4;\n\trepeated txOutput outputs = 5;\n\toptional string pinHash = 6;\n\toptional string passwordHash = 7;\n\toptional string captchaCode = 8;\n\toptional string colorCaptcha = 9;\n}\n\nwith embedded OTP message containing\n\nmessage OTPassword {\n\trequired string password = 1;\n\trequired uint32 counter = 2;\n\trequired string binHashHex = 3;\n}\n\nThis buffer is signed by the client device and the signature & contents verified by BitStash\n': 1, "I think I'm confused.

So what is on both screens is what is being requested.\n\nI don't follow this argument. Why can't malware key-log the pin and then use the encrypted signing key to sign an arbitrary transaction instead of the one the user wanted?\n\n> Not sure if you understand ProtocolBuffer definitions, but this is how the txSign message looks\n\nI'm familiar with protocol buffers but it's a bit hard to read without formatting.

So thats where its at.\n\nAnyways, there are ideas and then execution. When I put the design together I tried to address a number of markets, all with security needs. Now I have to execute, and as I am sure you are aware, thats not as easy.

So the concept of using the Big Screen on your cell phone does not cut it for the 2FA? Also considered using he NFC foe 2FA, confirm details on phone screen, tap on device to complete.': 1, 'Sorry for late reply, just seeing this now.\n\nI will try and answer this in a way that addresses all the potential issues.\n\n1) All messages to the device must be signed by an authenticated client device, signing keys distributed on setup\n\n2)All messages to the device contain an embedded HMAC based "one time use password" to prevent message replay scenarios\n\n3)All messages are defined as Protocol buffer messages\n\n4)A signTX message to the device does not contain a hex serialized transaction generated by the client, but rather a specification of claims ( utxos ) and outputs, as well as password hashes, and potentially user typed captcha solutions and color captcha solution.\n\n5)If only a single device is registered with BitStash, the BitStash device generates a random 4 digit captcha code, generates a captcha image, and sends it to the client device as a base64 encoded image over the signed, encrypted bluetooth connection. In addition it generates 9 color codes, which are displayed as the color captcha, and displays one of them on its LED ring. To complete a transaction in this mode, the user must enter their password, solve the 4 digit captcha, and choose one of the 9 colors that most closely matches the color the LED is displaying. Importantly the BitStash device generates a new Captcha code and color captcha every 15 secs, with the UI indicating to the user when its about to time out.\n\n6)If the single device registered is an IOS 8 device, then the user can configure security, such that IOS8 touchID fingerprint can be used in lieu of the captcha code.\n\n7) NOW TO YOUR QUESTION, here is the process as currently designed\n\nIn the case that multiple devices are registered with BitStash, the user can configure BitStash to require the second device participate in authenticating the transaction. So in the case of a desktop driven transaction the User would be prompted on their mobile device to confirm the transaction. Here is how it works\n\n7a) The user initiates a transaction from their desktop/laptop/iPad as normal. However, the 4 Digit Captcha is not displayed as normal on the desktop, instead the transaction details are shown on the mobile device, they confirm the details by pressing ok, and a 4 Digit Captcha code is displayed. They enter that code on the desktop application in the dialog displayed, along with their password. Now, importantly, in this mode, the initiating device will never be sent a signed transaction to relay to the network, instead the transaction is always relayed to the network from the BitStash device through the second/mobile device. \n\nIn the case that the mobile device is an IOS 8 device, with a fingerprint reader, the user can simplify 2 FA, and this is OUR preferred approach for simplicity, modifying this process, as follows\n\n7b) The user initiates a transaction from their desktop/laptop/iPad and enters their password. The transaction details are shown on the mobile device, they confirm the details by pressing using the IOS8 fingerprint reader, and the transaction is signed by BitStash and relayed to the network from the BitStash device through the mobile device. \n\n\nAll that said, we have a lot of flexibility here and would be delighted to incorporate feedback ': 1, 'svener, \nthat sucks, sorry, any suggestions ?\n': 1, "Wow, that's a really long comment. Thanks for being thorough.\n\nDo I understand the following correctly?\n\nIf both devices (laptop and mobile) are compromised and connected to the internet (or otherwise), the laptop could send a malicious transaction to the BitStash and send the intended transaction directly to the mobile device. The mobile device could then display the intended transaction instead of the malicious transaction to convince the user to approve the malicious transaction to be signed.\n\nOr did I miss something in your explanation that would prevent this from being possible?": 1, "I don't know enough about what Cloudflare is and why it is necessary to have.

Looking a bitcoin price chart from any source clearly shows the price line coming to a firm stop,  and then going back the other way.   This is actually changing the historic price,  which was higher just days ago.   \n  \n"Apparently there are quantum properties of bitcoin that are not fully understood," Eric Grant, Chief scientist at Bitcoin International said.   "The fact that this asset class can actually change its value through time in two dimensions unlocks possibilities that dollars and gold could only dream of."   \n  \nInternational criticism of the move has been swift,  with world leaders taking the stage to denounce the unprecedented price movement.   \n  \n"An asset that goes backwards in time and changes its value is essentially a two dimensional national security threat.   Bitcoin must be stopped. "  \n  \nThe CEO of Mastercard also was quoted as saying, " We tried to warn the world but no one listened.   Now,  the end times have arrived.   Mastercard only ever worked one way,  our way.   Bitcoin can apparently travel through space and time.   Also,  merchant adoption is low while Mastercard is accepted worldwide. "  \n  \nFor now,  supporters of bitcoin are baffled and frightened.  " It looks like the moving price graph is outlining the shape of a cat," said one noted holder who refused to be identified.   All over the Internet,  there is panic as bitcoin registers values lower in the past than it initially did,  forcing people to recalculate how much money they actually had at that point in time.   It also doesn\'t help that because the price graph went backwards,  the value of bitcoin is essentially undefined currently.  \n  \n"It\'s not zero, " said Eric Grant.  "It\'s basically undefined as it doesn\'t exist on the y-axis at this time.   It is just as accurate to say it\'s worth infinity."   \n  \nFor now,  all bitcoin enthusiasts can do is hope that the price line turns once again towards the present and makes it way back so they can have some idea of how much their asset is worth.   In the meantime,  all they can do is watch as the price literally rewrites history and changes how much it was worth in the past.   \n  \nIt\'s a complex world and we are all struggling to understand and come to grips with societies first two-dimensional asset class.

The shift of capital into perceived safe assets like Treasury Bonds or gold (and maybe bitcoin in the future!) is known as the Keynesian "flight to safety". For not-entirely-understood reasons, this tends to reduce the amount of cash circulating in the economy, creating deflationary pressures and a falling money supply.\n\nThis is what happened in 2008, when the financial crisis pushed many major economies into deflation. Since then, debt concerns in the United States and Europe have resulted in individuals reducing their spending even more than normal, triggering further increases to unemployment, further drops in spending and even more deflationary pressure. This in turn has encouraged even more investors to flee to safe assets like US Treasuries. \n\nIn this kind of environment, quantitative easing should not trigger inflation at all. What it should do is hold the money supply constant and thus counteract the deflationary pressures unleashed by the cumulative decisions of private actors in the private sector. This is the reason the market has been willing to purchase treasuries offering such low interest -- there is little perceived risk of inflation resulting from QE.\n': 2, "QE *is* money printing.

But the approach isn\'t controversial in any real sense. Anytime someone talks about the importance of investor confidence these days they are basically saying the same thing. And Keynes is mostly attacked for political reasons by people who hate fiscal policy. Yet these sorts of ideas are what justify monetary policy too.\n\nPractically, a lot of what has happened in academics since the 1940s has been various ways of trying to model the way the economy works to figures out the exact mechanisms by which the sort of vague pressures Keynes wrote about actually work. At what point do we say what kind of explanation still counts as Keynesian? There isn\'t a compelling mathematical model that works in all cases that I\'m aware of, but no-one worth taking seriously disputes the existence of liquidity traps or the idea that economies can fall into subpar equilibriums.\n\nEither way, don\'t take the attacks on Keynes as indicative that Keynesianism is incompatible with bitcoin. The only issue I can see offhand would be if all prices and wages got denominated in bitcoin, but this hardly seems realistic for a slew of reasons. In a worst case scenario, the government could also simply require contracts to be set in USD and then leave the settlement to the private sector in whatever currencies are most efficient.\n': 2, 'Very few (if any) can understand what\'s going on, and, more importantly, what will go on in the future.\n\nI can throw two theories in to give you som possibilities to explore:\n\n1.) "Deflationary forces" are still in play that have had a bigger impact than the money-printing. For instance, large financial institutions that to a large extent received the new money simply keep it as a buffer, and so it hasn\'t made it\'s way into the "real" economy yet.\n\n2.) Globalization and reserve currency mechanics in uncertain times: again, as (relative) "perceived safety", the dollar is "exported", thus increasing currency in circulation in countries other than the US. When these dollars are saved, this has (more than) two effects in the US: currency in circulation is diminished (deflationary) and goods come in from these countries in exchange for the dollars (deflationary).\n\nIn the receiving country, the effects are often the opposite. Thus inflation (paradoxically) typically often shows up around the world, particularly in weak economies, when new dollars are printed.\n\n...\n\nI can\'t get my mind around these mechanics myself (few can), but if you start looking, you can find ways that *might* explain apparent contradictions easily.': 4, "Exactly. Quantitative easing is designed to compensate for a collapse in the money supply.\n\nI agree with your sentiment by the way. There are many other ways to stimulate the economy, and it is damning that the political solution in Washington has been to rely almost exclusively on monetary policy over fiscal policy or alternative solutions like mortgage relief. The reliance on the Fed is clearly unjust in the way it enriches the same banks responsible for the crisis at the expense of individuals who lack access to the same cheap credit. Hell, I didn't contribute to the crisis and would love to get credit on those terms....\n\nWith that said, the excessive reliance on the Fed isn't really the Fed's fault. The organization has been forced to center stage in part because it isn't directly controlled by Congress, and there are a lot of politics frustrating legislative solutions (i.e. Republic attempts to vote against fiscal policy were strategic as much as ideological). So the whole situation really puts thinking people in a hard position, since as distasteful as the whole thing is, quantitative easing is still much better than the alternative (economic depression).\n": 3, 'Manipulation.
