The answer to the problem is actually in the post and this comment.\n\n>The payment protocol runs completely separate from the bitcoin network.\n\nYou\'re right, there\'s no need to alter the behavior of addresses.  The problem is solved when wallets provide complete support for payment protocol.  BIP70 includes support for what we need in the paymentDetails.  expires is "Unix timestamp (UTC) after which the PaymentRequest should be considered invalid."  There is a slight gap in that there is no definition for what "invalid" means and for whom; it should be interpreted by a wallet to mean "this address should not be sent a payment after this time" - and the wallet should comply.\n\n>The network can\'t force you to adhere to the payment protocol\'s rules.\n\nTrue. This is the real problem. Community pressure could motivate wallet providers (though I\'ve observed that this is not getting it done).  Idea: payment processors could agree on date after which they will only (at least by default) expose payment invoices that are BIP70 compliant (expressly not backward compatible).  This will materially impact the bottom line for processors since under, over, and late payments (all sources of cost overhead and poor UX) would be eliminated.  This would make it a pain for people using older wallets to pay which may motivate the users to change wallets and/or express displeasure to the wallet manufacturer.

BitPay offers 0% fees but if you're already using PayPal or Stripe, you may want to look into their solutions since it could make your life easier.\n\nUnrelated, but if you're looking to complete the circle, perhaps consider something like [BitWage](https://www.bitwage.co/) which allows employees to get paid a portion or their whole salary in bitcoin.

The person giving you the credit card information **has to trust you to only take what they're agreeing for you to take**. \n\nWith bitcoin, no trust is required.
