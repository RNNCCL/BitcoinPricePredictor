Earlier yesterday /u/based_ghandi posted a list of reddit users who have lost Bitcoin using the wallet service Blockchain.info provides; we track posts like this closely and even have our own internal list. This discussion was welcomed by Team Blockchain and we submitted a response to this post going over the primary security concerns facing not only our users, but all users of any web based bitcoin wallet service with action items on how to make your experience more secure. Bitcoin is still a very young system and we want to be an open and responsive part of system that has, as one of its greatest virtues, incredible support from a community of people passionate about building it. \n\nCharlie, you should be ashamed that you have tried to turn an open dialogue with the community about our respective roles as wallet providers in providing a secure service AND the users role in keeping their funds secure, into an inappropriate attempt by you to capitalize on the security discussion today and push your own agenda, like a shady lawyer chasing an ambulance.\n\n>Over the past year though, Coinbase kept introducing new security features while Blockchain.info wallet's security has stayed exactly the same, and arguably became worst.\n\nIt is simply dishonest to argue that Blockchain.info security has stagnated or regressed. We track this data closely, have made heavy investments into combating security issues and hardening our dedicated infrastructure. Improvements, measured in decreasing numbers of breeches, have been made. This is not to say that we have the final solution in hand -  we have a long way to go still, but it is more about creating sane security defaults and educating our users on proper security protocols. We are working tirelessly to improve the overall experience of our wallet products and building new tools and technologies; many of which the community will get to judge the merits of shortly. \n\nThe crux of the issue comes down to trying to compare apples to oranges, or should I say, a true block chain powered financial software product versus yet another online bank. We at Blockchain.info have never wanted to build a bank, we want to build the tools that allow our users to take full control of their finances, or as our slogan reads, \xe2\x80\x9cbe your own bank\xe2\x80\x9d. It is ingrained into our corporate culture that our users are always in control of their private key, always is exposed to the least amount of counterparty risk, and should NEVER have to trust us. \n\nCoinbase is able to implement interesting security features using existing plug-n-play technologies that Blockchain simply cannot do. Our architecture ensures all transactions remain on the block chain while Coinbase operates entirely in an off block chain setting. Coinbase knows their users email address, phone number, mailing address, credit profile, and more. Blockchain doesn\xe2\x80\x99t even require an email address to open a wallet. Coinbase knows the current balance, the past balances, the spending trends of every user. Blockchain has no idea how much bitcoin a wallet has. Our insistence on following the overarching vision of Bitcoin means that there will be times where the simple and easy technical solution will not work and we will need to innovate, much in the same way we innovatively created the first bitcoin wallet to be decrypted locally in the users browser thus ensuring Bitcoin users would always have an alternative to the centralized bank like institutions of Coinbase, and would ALWAYS be in full control of their private keys.\nStories of Coinbase freezing its users funds, investigating its users and reversing the suspicious transactions of long-time verified customers are well known and well documented in this sub. Even the new multi sig solution, which you you proffer above, is vulnerable to the same issues. Even if the coins are not under your sole control, users are still vulnerable and their private and personal data is still held by you and at risk. \n\nPart of our strategy at Blockchain has been to open source our wallet software (something Coinbase has not done as far as I am aware) We believe that this will not only help grow the community and ecosystem, gets more eyes on our code, and allows for anyone at anytime to review our code. Charlie, does Coinbase have any plans to open source any aspect of their wallet product? It is our assumption that you cannot, as users must trust you. \n\nAdditionally, I found it very strange you brought up Insurance in your overview. Blockchain has no need to acquire insurance as we never have access to customers funds, we never have access to a users private key, we couldn\xe2\x80\x99t lose our customers funds if we wanted to. Coinbase acts like a bank does today. Your users are trusting Coinbase to properly manage their bitcoin. Opening an insurance policy on millions of dollars in client assets is nothing to celebrate, its standard operating procedure. If Blockchain managed customer funds, we would also have an insurance policy. But we do not ever manage our customers funds, and we never will. It\xe2\x80\x99s important to note that your insurance only covers the funds in your hot wallet - which is a tiny fraction of the funds. Users are still reliant, for the vast majority of the funds, on Coinbase to properly secure them against internal and external theft. The history of Bitcoin is not full of companies that have managed to do this in the long-term and is full of those that have failed and lost hundreds of millions of dollars in users funds. \n\nLastly, I will caution your hubris regarding the state of Coinbase security. Indeed, Coinbase, as we are aware, has benefited from multiple serious disclosures from other industry members. You guys have no doubt done some great things lately, and serve a valuable role in the ecosystem, but no system is impenetrable. We should be working together as leaders in the space to create a stronger more secure ecosystem, rather than chasing after each others ambulances on reddit.  \n\nAt Blockchain, our goal is to build a powerful, world changing company and ecosystem. We hope Coinbase also feels this way and is willing to work together to build it. \n\nKeonne Rodriguez\n(N.b. I am the product lead for wallets at Blockchain.info, but this is from my personal account and represents my personal views). \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n": 105, "I was only referring to the security aspect.

This mechanism is analogous to the mechanism used to defraud people in a ponzi scheme. The cause (off-chain storage) is by the by, and the "lure" (i.e.: the promise of a return vs the promise of a future withdrawal) is interchangeable with that of the Ponzi scheme you describe above.\n\nAlso, the context matters. I still maintain the validity of the analogy by the "expert" as an informative tool to help explain the chief flaw in the Mt Gox failure.

The company\xe2\x80\x99s namesake, an extinct cousin of the penguin, was the suggestion of a friend of Garza\xe2\x80\x99s, who adopted it even though it had no relation to the company\xe2\x80\x99s mission. The two realized that there was a growing demand for the Internet in Vermont\xe2\x80\x99s small towns, where the fastest \xe2\x80\x93 and only \xe2\x80\x93 existing communications infrastructure was still the telephone line. They decided the answer to the problem lay in wireless technology.\n\n> At the initial test site in Salisbury, Vt., Garza created a wireless network around Lake Dunmore, providing Internet access to campground visitors in an area too distant from existing infrastructure to be of interest to other providers. The project was a success, increasing the value and desirability of the campground by allowing vacationers to surf the web. \xe2\x80\x9cThis was really neat,\xe2\x80\x9d Garza said, and he wondered if it might be feasible on a larger scale.\n\n> Word spread about the project and Garza began getting calls from other far-flung communities that were without high-speed Internet. With the help of local town officials, GAW set up transmitters in these communities and began signing people up for their service.\n\n> State officials soon began facilitating the expansion of GAW to areas lacking access.\n\n> \xe2\x80\x9cWe did a lot of work with the state of Vermont, New Hampshire and Massachusetts,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\n> To effectively install their equipment, Garza searched for a high, unobstructed area where a transmitter could be attached to an existing structure or a transmitter tower in use by other companies. In some areas, he noticed that several other wireless network companies had all installed individual equipment, and he realized it would be more efficient if they operated together, not separately.\n\n> At a meeting with these companies, his message of joining forces was generally thought to be a good move, but logistically it never got off the ground. Instead, GAW decided to buy the companies out.\n\n> \xe2\x80\x9cWe ended up buying about 12 wireless providers in New England,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\n> This helped GAW scale up, offering more speed and better coverage. Today, their coverage area includes portions of Connecticut, Massachusetts, Vermont and New Hampshire. GAW offers to bundle TV, Internet, and phone service for under $70, roughly equal to Comcast\xe2\x80\x99s price for the same bundle, and $20 cheaper than Verizon\xe2\x80\x99s Fios bundle option.\n\n> In Massachusetts, GAW worked with the Massachusetts Broadband Institute, an organization created by Gov. Deval Patrick to close the digital divide by connecting the state\xe2\x80\x99s rural towns to high speed Internet. The state took the initiative on what it calls the \xe2\x80\x9cmiddle mile\xe2\x80\x9d by undertaking the building of a broadband cable backbone that private companies could use to extend services to communities in the \xe2\x80\x9clast mile\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x93 the many underserved rural towns in the western part of the state.\n\n> Along with several other small Internet service providers, GAW received grant money in July from the state to be used to this end. Judy Dumont, who heads the Massachusetts Broadband Institute, was eager to include GAW in the state\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to connect communities.\n\n> \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s our mission to use both state funds and the federal funds that were granted to us to build the necessary infrastructure to lower the economic hurdles for companies like GAW that seek to provide these services,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\n\n> MassBroadband 123, the official name of the state\xe2\x80\x99s cable backbone project, was offered as an open network for any company to use, which made it possible for small companies like GAW, and many others, who wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t otherwise have the capital to construct such large scale infrastructure.\n\n> \xe2\x80\x9cIt was truly the definition of a public-private partnership,\xe2\x80\x9d Dumont said. In addition to its efforts in rural areas, GAW had also been getting calls from residents of urban areas where only one option existed for high-speed cable service. The expansion allowed GAW to provide its service at a lower cost than the existing cable providers in the once competition-free area. Still, the larger cable providers held an advantage over GAW in their array of offerings. Cable Internet was often bundled with phone and television service. By offering bundling deals, consumers were discouraged from switching Internet service alone, even if they were dissatisfied with it. If a customer threatened to switch, cable companies often offered special discounts to avoid losing business.\n\n> In response to this, GAW bought a phone company and worked out a deal with directive, allowing it to provide the same array of services as the meager companies.': 2, 'https://www.reddit.com/r/litecoinmining/comments/1yh23g/has_anyone_here_sold_their_own_rig_on_ebay_and/cfkvbbk  Someone in litecoin mining seemed to have dug up more on Great Auk Wireless.': 1, 'GAW the controversial scam mining company hasn\'t always actually meant Geniuses At Work (GAW).

': 4}, ('FutureCoin', 0): {"Nice thoughts. With bitcoin as a global currency, people will hold bitcoin, causing its value to go up.  This will throttle the economy as less money is invested in businesses, which will cause the value of bitcoin to stop going up. This causes people to invest in businesses in order to see some return, which increases the value of bitcoin. The currency value reflects the value of the economy. So, the current algorithm self regulates.  Deflation isn't a problem because people will always buy living essentials.  It just gives them an incentive to save.  ": 1, 'I hope thats the case, but I don\'t see it. Anything that is finite will run into the problems of supply and demand. I mean, a total of 21 million bitcoins means that if the entire US were to adopt BTC as currency, there\'d be 0.07 BTC for every individual (21 / 316).  \n\n"People will hold bitcoin, causing its value to go up. This will throttle the economy as less money is invested in business, which will cause the value of bitcoin to stop going up".\n\nIf the buying power of something is increasing, that just means you need to spend less of it - business are still invested in, but if there is a short supply of money, then less of the currency (that has greater value) will be invested, further driving the value of the currency up. \n\nIf you have something you know will be worth more tomorrow, then you\'ll spend less of it today.... on anything. If you are going to invest in something, and they think they need 200 BTC, you may invest 175 if you know that in a year those 175 are going to be worth 200. The economy doesn\'t get throttled... the only thing that gets throttled is the amount of currency moving around.  \n\n"The currency value reflects the value of the economy. " \n\nErm...... I don\'t buy it. I can\'t pick it apart right now but i just seems wrong. \n\n"Deflation isn\'t a problem because people will always buy living essentials."\n\nYes, people will always buy living essentials but that has nothing to do with preventing deflation.... aight, lemme fire up Libre and draft this propery....\n\nPeople need toilet paper, so Bob decides to build a toilet paper factory. He proposes this to some people that have some BTC. Bob has done the math, and he thinks he needs 3000 BTC. The investors speculate that BTC will continue its trend of increasing in value, so they decide to invest 2500 BTC into Bobs factory. \n\nBob takes the deal, because its hard to find investors, because people are saving. \n\nSo now Bob has 2500 BTC. So across the board, he has to cut 17% off everything. The machine the rolls the paper onto the tube? He had budgeted 500 BTC, but now he needs to get one for 415. \n\nJane builds toilet paper rollers. She thinks they are worth 500 BTC \xe2\x80\x93 indeed, thats how Bob got the price for his budget. But Jane can\'t get anyone to buy her machine at 500 BTC, because its nothing but Bobs out there that only have 415 BTC to buy a machine with. \n\nSo Jane agrees to build the machine for 415. Lets just assume (for simplicities sake) that the chain stops here, and Jane\'s machine really cost 405 to make \xe2\x80\x93 she was just hoping for crazy profits. So now instead of taking home 95 BTC, she\'ll take home 10 BTC. \n\nOkay, so this happens all over the board, and Bob is able to put together his factory. Now he has to buy pulp to make the TP with. Again, here he\'s going to try to get the most he can with his limited amount of BTC, so where he had planned on getting 500 BTC worth of pulp, he now only has 415 to get that amount with \xe2\x80\x93 and he needs that amount to break even on the plant based on the current prices of TP. So he finds Walter, a pulp supplier, willing to sell for 415. So now that commodity \xe2\x80\x93 trees that are turned into toilet paper \xe2\x80\x93 now has a value of 415 BTC. \n\nSo the pulp supplier ends up not being able to hire more people.\n\nSo Bob build his factory for 2500 BTC and he\'s making TP, so now it comes to pricing his TP.  \n\nEssentially, because Jane and Walter had goods that they needed to sell, and Bob was the only buyer, they sold their goods at the price that Bob could afford. So now Bob can sell his TP for less than his competitors price and still have a good profit margin. Lucky for Jane, cause she only took home 10 BTC, but now her BTC can buy more TP because Bobs TP is cheaper. \n\nBobs lower TP price will then cause his competitors to try and slash prices, so they will try to source their material for cheaper, so they\'ll all go to Walter and try to get that price because Walters somehow able to do it, and this will force the other pulp makers to sell at 415.... blah blah blah.\n\nIt all starts with the investors deciding to hold on to some of their BTC because the buying power of BTC has been on an upward trend. And the investors can be anyone \xe2\x80\x93 it could\'ve been crowdsourced. Thats where a currency gets its value \xe2\x80\x93 by the people using it. \n\n" It just gives them an incentive to save. "\n\nWhat the hell is point in saving? Money is not meant to be saved - its meant to be turned into something real. Its meant to be a temporary store of value so you can transform one thing into another. So you can turn your time into electricity. \n\n"The currency value reflects the value of the economy. "\n\n\nI\'ve also had some thoughts that any crypto will eventually have its value tied to the energy needed to crunch a transaction. It already kind of is tied to the price of energy, it will just be interesting when crypto is the only currency. The transaction fees that will eventually be the fuel for the network will have to be able to cover the cost of hashing.  \n\nAnd as the difficulty rises, it will eventually cost more to hash a transaction. So in this sense, the network may have a built in deflation deterrant. Essentially, it will cost more for you to send money tomorrow than it costs to send today.\n\nHowever, this could have the effect of suppressing the movement of money.\n\ninteresting. Anyone got any thoughts? I think I\'ve taken this thought train as far as I can push it this morning.
