Typically, when short of funds, the government simply delay paying merchants for purchases, but it was not safe to delay the payment of soldiers due to the risk of mutiny.\n\n>**Jacques de Meulles, the Intendant of Finance, came up with an ingenious solution \xe2\x80\x94 the temporary issuance of paper money, printed on playing cards.** This was purely a temporary expedient, and it was not until years later that its role as a medium of exchange was recognized. The first issue occurred in June 1685 and was redeemed three months later. However, the shortages of money reoccurred and more issues of card money were made in subsequent years. These cards were readily accepted by merchants and the public and circulated freely at face value. However, given their wide acceptance as money and the general shortage of coinage, many of the playing cards were not redeemed but remained in circulation. Eventually, the Governor of New France acknowledged their useful role as a circulating medium of exchange.[16]\n\nThe problem afterwards was inflation arose due to an inability to reign in the money/card "printing": https://thewealthofchips.wordpress.com/2015/05/06/the-history-of-money-and-playing-cards-in-canada/': 1}, ('3D Wallet Generator - for bitcoiners with 3D printers', 7): {'Starred': 1, 'Haha very funny :)': 1, 'Are you german?

Many bitcoin clients are designed to run on space- and power-constrained devices, such as smartphones, tablets, or embedded systems. For such devices, a simplified payment verification (SPV) method is used to allow them to operate without storing the full blockchain. These types of clients are called SPV clients or lightweight clients. As bitcoin adoption surges, the SPV node is becoming the most common form of bitcoin node, especially for bitcoin wallets.\n\nSPV nodes download only the block headers and do not download the transactions included in each block. The resulting chain of blocks, without transactions, is 1,000 times smaller than the full blockchain. SPV nodes cannot construct a full picture of all the UTXOs that are available for spending because they do not know about all the transactions on the network. SPV nodes verify transactions using a slightly different methodology that relies on peers to provide partial views of relevant parts of the blockchain on demand.': 42, "I'd really prefer not recommending 0.9.5 to people.

He gets a penny for each page that he *correctly* adds that way. \n\nAny errors would be rather expensive for the office, especially if they are discovered well downstream of the source.  To catch those errors as early as possible, each page with its total T is also checked by another worker, picked at random.  This second worker\'s task is to compute the sum E of the amounts in even-numbered lines, the sum O of those in odd-numbered lines, check that E + O = T, and write the difference D = E - O at the bottom of the page.  He too gets a penny *if D is correct*.\n\nThe first worker would not want to cheat (write a random total, without adding), since sooner or later the error would be found and he would lose all the money he earned.  But he could make a mistake; and he will make more money by working fast with a 10% chance of error, than by taking twice as much time for each sum with a 1% chance of error.  \n\nIf the second worker did not have to write down the difference D, but only write "correct" under the total, he would be better off cheating and always write "correct".  Even if the first worker made an occasional mistake,  the verifier would lose those pennies, but cheating would still be very worthwhile.  Seeing an error go past the verifier could make the foreman suspicious, but he would be unable to prove that the verifier was cheating in the other cases too.\n\nBut since the verifier has to write D, and will only get paid if D is correct, he must add all the numbers in the two groups anyway, and compute the difference D = E - O.  If he cheated on that task, and wrote a random difference D, he would eventually lose all the pennies he earned (unless he was extraordinarily lucky).  The only way he could still cheat is by skipping the last addition E + O and writing "correct" under T, without checking. But since he already did 95% of the work, cheating on that step would bring him very little advantage.\n\nThe difference D in this example is a certificate that the verifier, with high probability, did at least 95% of the work of checking the total T.  \n\nBack to bitcoin: the miner who mines a block could be required to include a similar certificate showing that he did almost all the work that would be needed to verify the previous block (or two blocks earlier, whatever). \n\nAs it is now, a miner gains more by skipping the verification, gambling on the previous block being correct, than by wasting time validating that block.
