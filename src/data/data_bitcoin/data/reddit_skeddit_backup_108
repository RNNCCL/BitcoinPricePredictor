You're creating actual Bitcoin transactions that represent payment channels with peers that you *can* broadcast whenever you want, which, through some clever economic tricks, allows participants to navigate money through a network to another peer *without having to* broadcast the transactions, so long as everyone plays nice.\n\nIf someone tries to cheat you, you broadcast a transaction to the Bitcoin network, which will settle a refund transaction back to you; the cheater loses all his money, and you will be given all funds in the channel.\n\nSo long as everyone is honest, it works swimmingly and peers can send funds instantly and securely in a decentralized network, without every moving away from Bitcoin-the-network.\n\nhttp://lightning.network/lightning-network-paper.pdf\n\nhttp://www.bitcoin.kn/2015/09/dr-back-on-lightning/\n\n---\n\nSidechains are separate blockchain that allow coins to be 'pegged' to the Bitcoin blockchain. To secure them, they are merge-mined using Bitcoin PoW proofs. Put simply. You can send money from the mainnet blockchain to a sidechain by, essentially, 'locking' the coins on the Bitcoin blockchain. You can send money from the sidechain back to the Bitcoin blockchain by submitting an SPV proof that 'unlocks' them. Sort of.\n\nhttp://www.bitcoin.kn/2015/09/dr-back-on-sidechains/\n\nhttp://blockstream.com/sidechains.pdf\n\n---\n\nThey are completely different, and serve different purposes.\n\nThe Lightning Network is (primarily) a scalability solution that increases transactional capacity on the Bitcoin network arbitrarily high; peers can communicate money to one another however often they so desire (given they have coins) without permanently imposing cost on independent validators of the Bitcoin network.\n\nSidechains can be used to do pretty much anything. So far they are interesting because they allow for a permissionless testbed of innovation on top of the blockchain. The barrier to innovating on top of the Bitcoin mainnet chain is typically quite high, which sidechains could potentially solve. Sidechains obsolete many altcoins that need to bootstrap an entirely new coin just to test some new feature/direction, and allows development of those altcoins to happen with an already-bootstrapped currency.\n\nWhether sidechains are a practical scaling solution; not really. They suffer the same fundamental scaling problems any Blockchain does.\n\n> 2 - How can alt coins integrated into the main bank when blockchain using the lighting network or sidechains?\n\nDon't really understand this question..?": 4, "Fundamentally there is nothing stopping people doing that. The store could try to mitigate it by checking whether the transaction has enough fees to confirm quickly, or they could not allow the customer to leave until their transaction gets enough confirmations.\n\nThe way bitcoin works is that transactions recorded in the blockchain are not reversible, and the more blocks they have built on top of them the greater their irreversibility. Unconfirmed transactions could be changed or replaced for any number of reasons.\n\nYou might say bitcoin is not that great for in-person purchases like this. In the future it's likely that people would use something called hash-locked bidirectional payment channels which would be able to have instant irreversible cheap payments.": 2, 'Two questions:\n\n1.

This is done through a two way pegging mechanism where bitcoins are suspended on the bitcoin blockchain and new coins are created on the side chain.

These are still bitcoin transactions, only they don't hit the Bitcoin blockchain for every transaction (only to send bitcoin to the payment channel and to close it).  This allows for more microtransactions, where any individual transaction might be for an amount smaller than the bitcoin transaction fees.  When accumulated over the period, these small amounts aggregate into a payment worthy of the bitcoin transaction fees.\n\nA sidechain is a conversion into some other unit of value, that has a constant exchange rate to/from Bitcoin.  So, you might be able to buy 1500 units of X-coin per bitcoin, and transact in those outside the bitcoin network.

Our vision for Bitcoin is to expand the flexibility of the system to work efficiently at extremely high scale, while at the same time maintaining security and the core properties of decentralization that make Bitcoin unique.\n\n> We believe Bitcoin can accomplish this by providing the foundation for additional layers on top of the protocol and interfaces with other systems. Furthermore, our long term goals include protecting and improving the privacy of Bitcoin users.\n\n- [Lightning](https://github.com/LightningNetwork/lnd)\n- [Sidechains](https://github.com/ElementsProject/elements)\n\n**Bigblockist vision of Bitcoin**\n\n- [Gavin Andresen](https://bitcointalk.org/?topic=3118.0): "there will be big companies spending lots of engineering dollars on their own highly optimized versions of bitcoin.

That will begin to change as we scale up. I don\'t want to oversell BitCoin. As we scale up there will be bumps along the way. I\'m confident of it. Why? For example, as the volume of transactions come up--right now, I can run BitCoin on my personal computer and communicate over my DSL line; and I get every single transaction that\'s happening everywhere in the world. As we scale up, that won\'t be possible any more. If there are millions of bitcoin transactions happening every second, that will be a great problem for BitCoin to have--means it is very popular, very trusted--but obviously I won\'t be able to run it on my own personal computer. **It will take dedicated fleets of computers with high-speed network interfaces, and that kind of big iron to actually do all that transaction processing**. I\'m confident that will happen and that will evolve. But right now all the people trying to generate bitcoins on their own computers and who like the fact that they can be a self-contained unit, I think they may not be so happy if BitCoin gets really big and they can no longer do that.\n\nThese visions are incompatible. It\'s either we do all the transaction validation in datacenters, or we scale with intelligent software design.': 3, 'Gavin has pretty much given up on decentralized mining': 1, 'I don\'t understand why you continue to be so rude to people.  You needn\'t say "Were it a novel, you wouldn\'t have read it".\n\nAnd again, correlating user increase with a decrease in node count is ignoring the prevalence of SPV wallets as well as the increase in high quality web-wallets (as opposed to Mt. Gox).  While these uses may not be strictly increasing the decentralization of the bitcoin network, it does give reason to believe Hermel\'s postulation on ratio between node count and usercount is still valid.': 1, 'Everyone seems to agree that there is a trade-off between decentralization and capacity. So if we want to be able to pinpoint the right balance more accurately, a clear metric is needed. Let us try to do that.\n\n1. Capacity: this is the number of transactions per second the system can support. The higher, the better. The number of users should be roughly proportional to that.\n\n2. Decentralization: the most popular measure seems to be the [number of full nodes](https://bitnodes.21.co/dashboard/?days=365), which currently is between 5000 and 6000. The more, the better. Also, it is important that they are geographically distributed.\n\nGreg\'s trade-off basically says that increasing capacity makes it more expensive to do validation, and thus fewer users will run full nodes. This argument seems very simplistic and only takes first-order effects into account. For example, let us assume that increasing capacity ten-fold (i.e. to 10 MB blocks) leads to half of all full nodes giving up. Only having 2500 full nodes left would be a clear loss. On the other hand, this would also support a 10-fold increase in the number of users. If the share of new users that runs a full node is similar to that among the old users, the influx of new users would push up the number of full nodes to 25000 again, making the capacity increase a net win for decentralization, as the number of full nodes would increase fivefold!\n\nSo even if we completely neglected capacity and only maximized decentralization, the optimal block size could be way above the current, arbitrarily chosen limit of 1 MB. It would be great if the "decentralization" crowd could back their reasoning with actual numbers and metrics. My own back-of-the-envelope calculations hint that ideal decentralization would require block sizes significantly higher than 1 MB.': 5, 'I worked for Mozilla then.

I always thought miners considered the ip address of their nodes to be top secret - they weren't even on hillary's email server": 1, "It's planned that the relay network will be coming down soon, however someone else might run it or miners might run it on their own\n\nNormal nodes don't connect to miners directly no \n\nIt's difficult to make people use decentralized things as a safety measure, that's why people use Coinbase to store their coins and why miners skip validation of blocks, ignoring the risks is considered worth it ": 0, 'One of the main advantages of the relay network is that it reduces redundant delivery of data. On the normal Bitcoin network, you usually have to download and upload each transaction at least twice: once as a stand-alone transaction, and once as part of a block. The relay network compresses blocks by keeping track of which transactions each node has already seen, and then just refers to those previously-seen transactions instead of actually sending them when sending a block relay. This makes blocks a lot smaller, which reduces block-relay latency and therefore the number of stales ("orphans") for miners. There are proposals for doing something similar in Bitcoin (eg. IBLT or weak blocks), but this\'ll always be less efficient than the centralized approach, and these proposals have some problems still being discussed.\n\n> most major wallets/exchanges/etc also connect directly to the miners to submit transactions.\n\nSome exchanges/EWallets do this, but I don\'t know of any software wallets that do this. Miners still get most of their transactions from the Bitcoin P2P network, I think.\n\nMining centralization is really bad. There are three main attacks that miners can do:\n\nFirst, miners can break the rules of Bitcoin and create invalid blocks. Full nodes will reject these blocks no matter what, but lightweight nodes will accept them. If most of the economy is backed by full nodes, then this gives miners a massive incentive to follow the rules, and even if they don\'t, Bitcoin can continue on by just ignoring these miners. But if only a very small part of the economy is backed by full nodes, or if the only significant part of the economy backed by full nodes is cooperating with the rule-breaking miners, then the miners effectively have absolute control over Bitcoin. If this happens, I could easily see a scenario some years down the line in which miners work together with several massive exchanges to push through an increase to the money supply, justifying it by getting the support of famous economists, etc. Most Bitcoin users wouldn\'t be in a position to stop them, since they would\'ve given up their "vote" by not running a full node.\n\nThe defense against this is for most of the economy to run full nodes. Additionally, SegWit opens up the possibility that in the future, SPV-style nodes could receive fraud proofs from full nodes elsewhere on the network which would prove that the longest chain is actually invalid. Then even lightweight nodes would follow the rules of Bitcoin no matter what, assuming they\'re able to receive the fraud proof messages from full nodes.\n\nSecond, miners could censor transactions. It is very worrying that just a small handful of people who are *all in the same country* could be ordered by their government to stop all Bitcoin transactions. They\'d just reject all Bitcoin transactions and all blocks of competitors. It can be coded and deployed in hours. Maybe even worse, they could allow only transactions that are somehow "verified" by the government.\n\nOne defense against this is to improve Bitcoin transaction anonymity with things like CoinJoin and confidential transactions (CT) so that miners don\'t know what transactions to censor. The only other defense is to be prepared to change the PoW algorithm as soon as miners do something like this.\n\nLastly, there is of course double-spending. Though the gains from double-spending tend to be limited, since miners can only double-spend transactions that they themselves have sent. If miners do massive double-spending attacks, or undo large numbers of blocks just to cause havoc, the only solution is a PoW algorithm change.\n\nIn general, it\'s not known how to fix mining centralization. There\'s been tons of discussion, but no conclusion. Pure PoS has serious known problems. Some are worried that combining PoW with PoS (such as in the Proof of Activity proposal) makes the system much more difficult to analyze, but without any clear benefit. It\'s very difficult (maybe impossible) to make a PoW algorithm that will be fast on CPUs or GPUs, but not significantly faster on ASICs; additionally, if it\'s only fast on x86 CPUs, then there are now only two manufacturers of effective mining devices (Intel and AMD), and the people with the biggest mining power will probably be botnet operators. It might be the case that the best option is to just stick with normal cryptographic hash functions, but be constantly prepared to hardfork to a different algorithm if the miners abuse their position.\n\nIt\'s mostly unrelated, but here\'s another concerning source of centralization that comes to mind: Did you know that BitcoinJ (which underlies most lightweight wallets) only ever connects to peers returned by 7 centralized servers? So if you can get control of one of these servers and DDoS the rest, and you can mine at least one block, then you can send whatever transactions you want (including transactions creating unlimited BTC from nothing) to almost any user of lightweight wallets, and they\'ll treat your transaction as valid.': 1}, ('http://getyourbitco.in/ ( This is not spam, please read lol) I mean no harm', 0): {}, ('Conspiracy Theory - What if the Block Size Debate Will Be Solved Just Before The Halving', 2): {"Ah, then carry on.
