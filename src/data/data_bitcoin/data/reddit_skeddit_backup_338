I.e. no funds were ever lost apart from the buggy 184 billion that were incorrectly credited into the system.  It's worth noting that newly mined coins can't be spent for 100 blocks to allow chain forks like this to be resolved automatically before they can really be spent... Forks happen all the time as a byproduct of how mining works, nothing serious about them.  This bugfix was a hardfork however where people had to choose which chain to follow... it's the same problem for the blocksize however that's not as clear cut which is the preferred path.  Luckily the miners are the ones who pay the cost not adopting the most popular chain so they have an incentive to co-ordinate on upgrading.\n\n\nYour funds in bitcoin are safe as long as you keep your private key(s) safe, don't reuse addresses and make sure you use a reputable wallet.": 1, '" How can I trust my money if one person can do that? "\n\nFrom this I\'ve just realised you might not be talking about mining at all but more about general usage of bitcoin.  \nOnly someone with the private key/password to the address can transfer any value stored in it... miners can only confirm if it\'s correct or not, they can\'t change other people\'s balances or create transactions from other people\'s addresses.\n\n\nAs for who decides... that\'s essentially based on which version of the bitcoin rules are being followed by the network.  Anyone can edit the code and publish a change to bitcoin but 50%+ of the bitcoin mining nodes (and major payment/exchange gateways) have to pick up that change for it to be used.\n\nThe \'official\' master bitcoin reference client in github has only 5 members in it who can release a version... typically everyone follows this because they know what they\'re doing and earned the trust.  That said, if they decided to up the max coins from 21 million to 42 million I\'m pretty sure the \'official\' bitcoin client would no longer be the leading version as the miners would simply use either an older version or a new branch no longer controlled by those 5 people.\n\n': 4, "No worries, welcome to the rabbit hole!\n\n\nThere's a lot to introduce you to in order to answer this correctly.   But in a TL;DR approach, no it's not really possible for bitcoin to become infected due to it being incredibly robust via a positive feedback system.  Even if one persons computer was opened up to do the worst it still couldn't rewrite other people's transactions.. the absolute worst it could do for these miners would be change the address where the new bitcoins were sent to... but by doing this the pool and all contributing miners would probably notice it before they even solved a block.\n\n\nSo only miners actually earn bitcoins for verifying the transactions.  Typically people contribute their mining power to a single pool computer that is running the bitcoind system and publishes any block it finds a solution to.  When that pool computer finds a solution (due to one of the contributing miners finding the solution) the pool can credit itself with 25BTC in that block... that's the rules, that's what the bitcoin protocol is... a set of rules.\n\nThat block is now sent around the bitcoin network and people can verify that the block is indeed valid (i.e. they check the transactions too) and if they agree it's valid and that pool did find a solution to the mining problem the block is appended to the end of the blockchain and miners now start building on top of this block.\n\n\nSo to answer your question, a pool's computer could become infected and pay the reward to the hackers address but the pool would know about it pretty much instantly before they even started mining on a block and they'd certainly know about it after finding a block!   This attack vector is not very profitable for a hacker since they could probably only do it once and would be a lot of work!\n\nInfecting miners machines addresses (where the pool will send that miners earnings as a % of their contribution to the pool) can also be infected.  If you look at pool sites people typically type in an address for the pool to send the funds to so this could be modified in the pool's own db system.  Pools are very hardened from constant attack so usually have things like 2 factor authentication required to change a payout address making this again a hard attack vector.\n\n\nActually changing the payout address in a mined block is absolutely not possible, for that you'd have to go into how mining works but if you change anything inside that block it invalidates the solution the miners find so if someone tried changing the payout address like that the rest of the network would simply ignore it as it's no longer a valid block.\n": 25, "So in the scenario that Alice is buying a pizza.

This means, the entire network has to accept this information, and majority mining power has to build 100 new blocks on top of it, each accepting the one before it as authentic.\n\nThere are two things that can break this process.\n\nOne is an exploit getting discovered in the proof-of-work algorithm, which would ultimately result in Bitcoin replacing it with another one.\n\nThe other is, majority mining power getting controlled by an attacker, which incidentally would also result in the replacement of the proof-of-work algorithm. This one is usually considered the most important threat to Bitcoin.\n\n> debate about increasing the block size, who gets to do that?\n\nThe important thing one needs to understand is, everyone running a Bitcoin node decides on the rules. There is no voting system in place at the fundamental level. Currently there doesn\'t seem to be an "intentional" disagreement on the rules, so everyone is running the same "Bitcoin".\n\nIf there was disagreement, and say some part of the network decided to support bigger blocks, they would practically become a new network. This is called a hard fork.\n\nUltimately, there is no person or entity that can choose on behalf of nodes.

Now my response:\n\nUnlike bitcoin, trust is likely going to be part of any identity scheme that aims to compete with passports. Even DNA does not by itself establish birth location, birth date or whether you were in southern Sudan when the rebels were there. \n\nSo thinking about trust as an integral part of identity is important.\n\nIn my example Target clearly needs to trust themselves (and their employees who do the initial setup) and other companies will also have to decide whether to build their own identity schemes or trust someone else's (i.e. Target's) verification.\n\nThat said, trust has its problems. So my view is we just want to be able to decentralize that trust as much as possible. \n\nThis is where these idcams come in. They are strictly volunteer things.

We've been continuously building and releasing open-source components since we started. Some things take more time than others to release.\n\nAlso, I'm a fan of the thinking behind idchains. At it's core, it is simply facial recognition-based authentication combined with signed statements by institutions that link a particular image of a face to a legal person.\n\nI'd point out that this works great for in-person contexts and it's great as a replacement for a physical ID but it cannot work well and securely online. Now, you can combine this with a private/public key-based system to get properties of both, but at this point you lose the ability to not require people to store private keys.\n\nOne other problem with the idchains proposal is it complicates things quite a bit. There's no need to go through the steps of turning an image into a private key and then an address on the blockchain. The verification graph does not need to be represented as transactions on the blockchain (and probably shouldn't be, for storage and privacy reasons).\n\nA simpler way to go would be to have institutions digitally sign a document with an image in it that they have matched against your face in person.": 8, 'So you want to replace Namecoin with Blockstore, an untested protocol developed by a business?

If the interval was 6 hours, it might have been better to use other distributed consensus mechanisms, that are not viable with a 10 min interval.\n\nThis is basic engineering reality: when you set out to design something with a different purpose, you almost always end up with a solution that is different in almost every detail.

What\'s a good permanent inflation rate then?\n\nYou are confusing the technical sense of "inflation", namely "increase in the money supply", with its popular sense, "loss of purchasing power".\n\nBitcoin has decreasing inflation, ending with zero, in the technical sense only.  It doesn\'t guarantee anything about the purchasing power (or the price in USD), and never intended to.  \n\nBut when you wrote "non-depreciating", of course, you meant the latter sense.  Sorry, but bitcoin is not it.\n\nFor currency use, variations of purchasing power of 10-12% per year (in either sense) are still tolerable, and 5% per year would be fine.  If bitcoin was not hoarded for speculation or long-term investment, its value would be determined by its usage through the money velocity equation, and that would hopefully keep its value stable enough for that use.  \n\nSatoshi could not guarantee that either; but if the currency lost 30% in one year, it would be a bad currency, but still useful for some niche cases.  Whereas, as a "non-depreciating store of value", it would be a disaster.': 3, "Transaction volume *must* grow for Bitcoin to be workable, but doing so through blocks of an increased size is *not* sufficient!

There is no solution for this "starving miners" problem, no matter what the devs will do.  So it is irrelevant for the block size limit discussion.\n\nHowever, it is very likely that traffic will grow enough to bring the network to near-saturation, within 6-12 months.  The increase in the block size limit is urgently necessary to solve **this** saturation problem, not the starving miners problem.\n\nSaturation will seriously degrade the usability of the network, which is already very poor.  It will not attract more users, or more traffic, quite the opposite; so it will not solve the starving miners\' problem either.  There will not be a viable ONW *design* in that time frame, much less a functioning ONW, so the ONW is irrelevant to the issue, too.\n\n> there\'s no fundamental reason why users couldn\'t retain control of settled coins just as they do now\n\nIf the ONW is meant to reduce the on-chain traffic by factor of 100, a coin will have to change hands 100 times on average before it moves once in the blockchain.   \n\nHopefully, the person who owns some "overcoins" may be always able to force a settlement and get the same amount of boitcoins on the blockchain; but it is not clear at all how exactly that would happen, given that those overcoins represent bitcoins that were originally locked into Payment Channels by other people and other hubs.  \n\nDo not feel bad if you don\'t know the answer.  I have asked this or equivalent questions to Adam Back, Luke Dashjr, a couple other Blockstream devs, and even to Joseph Poon, one of the Payment Channel inventors.  Invariably, that is the end of the conversation.\n\n> > An ONW based on Payment Channels will actually increase traffic on the blockchain until more than 70% of all bitcoiners adopt it.\n\n> If that is true, then it would only spur adoption naturally, as it becomes too expensive to send every little transaction directly on the Bitcoin blockchain\n\nThat does not make sense.  Making bitcoin worse cannot possibly help adoption.  \n\nIf the ONW will be more attractive to users than raw bitcoin as it is ***now***, then one should keep bitcoin working as it is ***now*** (i.e., with a lifted block size limit to avoid saturation); if and when the ONW becomes available, it will naturally attract more users, and attract user away from bitcoin -- without the need to make bitcoin less usable first.\n\nOn the other hand, if the ONW is going to be *less* attractive to users than raw bitcoin as it is ***now***, then forcing users to move to it would *reduce* user adoption.  Then, too, the best is to lift the block size, and let the users of raw bitcoin grow, even at a modest pace. \n\n> A hard fork is not a non-event; it is a changing of the contract to which users agreed already\n\nThere is no contract.  Every change in the software of network -- BIP66 and other soft forks, AML/KYC by exchanges, fee changes, RBF, soft size limit, concentration of mining -- were carried out or happened without the explicit consent of holders, users, miners, etc..  \n\nFor the typical user, the conceptual difference between a hard fork and soft fork is insignificant.  In both cases he had better download a new version of the software, and does not even have to understand what changed.\n': 1, "Except, they're not identical, most serious Bitcoiners are hodlers, and most transactions today are rubbish.": 1, 'That is the point.  \n\nThe Core devs (Luke, at least) claim that their version is "correct" by definition, and any software that disagrees with it about the validity of some block is incorrect.   \n\nMany other people instead have an idea (usually incomplete, maybe fuzzy) of what a valid block *should* be; and, if some software is not consistent with that idea, the software is buggy -- even if it is the Core software.  \n\nFor example, when an overflow bug in the core created a few quadrillion bitcoins, in 2010, most people agreed that it was a bug in Core, not a feature of bitcoin,': 1, '*facepalm*\n\n**It\'s simple arithmetic, folks!**\n\n"[Our analysis](https://tradeblock.com/blog/bitcoin-network-capacity-analysis-part-3-miner-incentives) indicates that for compensation per block to remain constant after the next halving event, fees would have to increase to ~$4.6 per transaction (from 4 cents today) if transaction volumes and \\[BTC\\] price remain unchanged."\n\nOf course, such fees will never happen. Instead, the BTC price will rise, and the mining industry will probably shrink; as time goes by, the price will rise less and less, and the mining industry will shrink more and more.\n\nHopefully, transaction *volume* can increase to spread the costs across more people.\n\nIt should be noted that according to [the same analysis of real-world data](https://tradeblock.com/blog/bitcoin-network-capacity-analysis-part-2-macro-transaction-trends), "the average bitcoin transaction data size has grown to roughly 600 bytes".\n\nThus, in a *completely&nbsp;full* **100&nbsp;MB block**, you could get 166666 transactions of an average nature; that\'s 277.8 transactions per second.

So, lifting the limit would not make any difference for the next 6 months or so.

If most players like the change, they will upgrade before the scheduled fork time; the old coin will die right away, and the new coin will inherit its value.  Users who have upgraded will not even notice that the fork happened; those who failed to upgrade, even afer all warnings, will find their coins frozen until they upgrade.\n\nIf most players dislike the change, they will not upgrade, the new coin will die right away after the fork, the value will remain with the old version.  Again, the users who did not upgrade will not even notice that the fork happened, while those who did upgrade will find their coins frozen until they revert to the old version.  \n\nBoth branches will survive only if the community remains divided up to and through the fork date.  But, in that case, a split would be the right thing to do: why should one side force the other to use the version that they like?

How do you propose to handle such a fundamental shift?  This will be much harder to implement than simply increasing the blocksize.

It took two years, from July **2012** to July 2014, for the traffic to double from ~30'000 tx/day to ~60'000 tx/day; and then another year for it to double again, to ~120'000.   The traffic will not increase fast enough to allow the miners' revenue loss to be compensated by fees.\n\nOn the other hand, a substantial hike in the minimum fee (to 0.25 USD per transaction, say) would be necessary anyway, to induce miners to process all transactions promptly.  (An increase in the block size limit and a minimum fee hike would also have the added benefit of making spam attacks much more costly, hence less likely.)  But even a more modest hike would probably cause a huge drop in the traffic, perhaps by 80% or more.  The traffic now seems to be dominated by non-payment uses that exist only because transactions seem to be free.

To exemplify this fact he proposes as a limiting example the case of a hypothetical benevolent miner owning a majority of the network hashrate (say 99%). Since any mined block propagates instantaneously to himself, he won\'t produce any orphaned blocks and, as such, is incentivized to take on larger and larger blocks indefinitely.\n\nFrom my understanding, as discussed in the paper, the block propagation time is a number which quantifies the average time taken to communicate a mined block to the majority of the network. This is argued to grow linearly with the blocksize (the more data in the block -> the more data to transfer -> the longer it will take) and can be easily modified to include the instantaneous propagation time to oneself. Denoting by \'h\' and \'H\' the miner\'s and network\'s hashrate respectively, the propagation time appearing in Peter_R\'s calculations is straightforwardly modified to:\n\n \\tau(Q)\\to(1-h/H)\\tau(Q)\n\n(for proper formatting: http://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\\dpi{120}&space;\\large&space;\\tau(Q)\\to(1-h/H)\\tau(Q))\n\nThis modification implies that in all formula\'s from equation (10) onwards, one must simply modify \'Q\' into \'(1-h/H)Q\' in all the exponential terms that appear.\n\nThe phenomenological aspects of the paper remain perfectly intact as the extra (1-h/H) factor trivially alters the slope of the supply/demand curves. Particularly, Peter_R\'s proof for the impossibility of an "unhealthy" fee market still stands as the extra hashrate-dependent factor doesn\'t change the Q-dependent asymptotics of his equations.\n\nI hope this helps.

I wouldn't even bother with the subject. I dont invest. I dont have any specific expectations. I live in the UK where banks work pretty well in terms of making payments. However I value using Bitcoin for financial privacy and not providing all my credit card details to make a payment. \n\nI recognise that if I want to make anonymous payments then cash is the best thing as Bitcoin is not anonymous. \n\nThe dollar or pound has no intrinsic value. It is sustained by Governments making payments in their national currency and expecting citizens to pay them in the national currency. Bitcoin is a free market in which price is determined by the participants. It could be worth $1 million or zero. The market decides. \n\nIt is not a pump and dump scheme itself because no one is persuading you to buy or sell. It's voluntary. That doesn't mean actors in the market cant use buying and selling to make profit and does not exclude  bad people trading Bitcoin or scamming people.\n\nYour friend is presumably an adult and he needs no permission to use Bitcoin or, if he chooses, it does he not need to use Bitcoin. I personally find a 20% discount at Starbucks with the foldapp a good reason to use Bitcoin for some of my daily transactions. It's his choice whether to use dollars, pounds, gold or Bitcoin. \n\n": 2, 'These points are to a large extent unrelated to each other and indicate that he has made up his opinion and does not want to change it. For example, a pump and dump does not imply that it\'s a scam, and a scam does not imply that it will fail. There are pump and dumps done with things which are broadly accepted as legitimate, and there are scams which continue for decades if not centuries. It works the other way around too, there are non-scams which fail just as well.\n\nOther things just do not even connect to each other. For example point 7. Deanonymising has nothing to do with how powerful computers are, but how much data the adversary collects.\n\nIn general, a lot of the issues mentioned are empirical ones, you can\'t say it\'s entirely one way or another or which direction it will evolve. For example, regarding point 12: you can probably persuade someone that something which is not a bitcoin is a bitcoin. But the costs of verifying the authenticity of bitcoin are very low and do not require special contractual obligations, special hardware or skills. Unlike, for example, your bank account balance (which the bank can set arbitrarily and you have no way to audit it), cash or gold coins, which require special equipment to check and is not easily portable. The authenticity of a bitcoin you can verify with your mobile phone, for example.\n\nSome claims are empirically false. For example, after it was announced that Silk Road 1.0 was shut down by the FBI, the price went up dramatically and it is still higher than at that time.\n\nThe point of bitcoin is not primarily anonymity or "currency". It is about the ability to enforce contractual obligations. Some others may say it\'s about uncensorability (which is a different way of saying the same thing). The "currency" and pseudonymity are just a bonus.': 2, 'Wut': 2, "> If it doesn't provide anonymity then what's its purpose? It doesn't have a selling point.\n\ndecentralized, no inflation; quick, international transactions\n\n> You can counterfeit it.\n\nAt this point, I think this is troll. Crypto-currencies might be the only currencies that CAN'T be counterfeit.... ": 2, '> Bitcoin was a very elaborate pump and dump scam.\n\nPersonally I don\'t think so as Satoshi hasn\'t touched his coins and even if he did others would buy them so the value remains.  Some things can be done with bitcoin that are simply not possible in other systems.  Trustless escrow, automated machines, multisignature payments, timelocked payments, globally instant transfers, digital contracts, etc...\n\n\n>Quoted from the Bitcoin website "Eventually we\'re gonna need everyone on the Bitcoin network to exchange a 1 GB/s". How is that property not part of a pump and dump?\n\nThere are ways to solve the 1Gb issue... currently we don\'t need to so it hasn\'t been addressed yet but there are proposals that could be implemented and wil ljust take time. I.e. It\'s still actively being developed and everyone is still learning.\n\n\n> Bitcoin is not anonymous. It\'s not private and it will not scale with participation due to need 1GB/s.\n\nIt is anonymous if you want it to be... it\'s pseudo anonymous but if someone has the time and determination to find who owns certain coins those who simply use it can probably be easily found with warrants.  That\'s a good thing btw as usually people complain the opposite!  Sidechains and zero proof transactions are likely to make coins anonymous but these don\'t exist beyond test networks and alt coins as far as I know.\n\n\n> So what are people paying for if they understand it doesn\'t have these properties? Ergo Pump and Dump.\n\nThey\'re jumping on the bandwagon and probably will get hurt jumping off it as the price drops only to miss it when it goes up again.  The ones holding on are the ones who see why it has value beyond a pump and dump and why the fairly constant higher price exists after the last \'dump\'.\n\n\n> The more powerful computers get the easier it will be to track people so it can\'t improve its anonymity.\n\nThe power of the computers is not relevant to this...  no amount of extra computing power simplifies this process, it\'s more about running nodes on the network.\n\n\n> If it doesn\'t provide anonymity then what\'s its purpose? It doesn\'t have a selling point.\n\nSee above... there are many uses of a finite digital resource with a common global ledger... that\'s precisely it\'s selling point.  \n\n\n> Bitcoin is not a currency it is ones and zeros, you cannot keep Bitcoin\'s in a treasury.\nAll currency is 1\'s and 0\'s these days.  If someone believes money is in the form of coins and notes they\'d do well learning about how fiat currency works.  Most people when talking about money are talking about M3 money where an absolutely tiny fraction is physical cash and notes.\n\n\n> How it is valuable? It has no valuable properties. \n\nIt is finite in supply, it is instantly transferable anywhere around the globe, it requires no permission to use it, it can be exchanged for real goods and local fiat currency in most countries.  That alone sets it head and shoulders above any national currency.  For end users you never have to give out details where they can steal your money, you give someone your address and they can only give you money... the same way we do with cash but over the internet.\n\n\n\n> Bitcoin went down after the DarkNet Silkroad etc. went down. It wasn\'t being traded and its value couldn\'t be measured so it went down.\n\nWell that\'s just wrong and they can look any of the graphs to know that ;)  Firstly when SR was taken down the price went up, actually it soared only a few months later if memory serves me correctly.  SR was a part of bitcoin\'s checkered history but remember bitcoin wasn\'t created for any specific site or user.  I for one didn\'t even know about SR until it was shut, I got into bitcoin because I saw bitcoin\'s potential and still do.\n\n\n> SHA1 hashes of random bytes are not valuable.\n\nIf you have a brain wallet generated by a SHA1("Hello World") and someone has put funds in that address it could be as valuable as you make it.  Generally though Bitcoin doesn\'t use SHA1 anywhere, it uses SHA256.  If you could somehow reverse engineer SHA256("message" + x) = y such that you instantly know x when given y you can earn yourself over $1,000,000 USD per day... this is what most mining farms are doing and the only way they know to solve it is by using a lot of electricity.\n\n\n\n> You can counterfeit it.\n\nNo you can\'t.  That\'s kind of it\'s whole point.  It can\'t be magicked out of thin air, you have to use **a lot** of electricity to generate new ones otherwise you must trade with the supply available in the ecosystem.\n\n\n> Supernodes would need 1GB/s and around 50 cores - That is not achievable. This will require Supernodes who act as banks and can manipulate Block Chains abstractly as it will be internal to their organization.\n\nWe\'re not even close yet... won\'t be for a long time and 50+ cores (will be probably pretty min spec phone stuff by this stage).  If they don\'t believe you explain how GPUs in mobile phones have hundreds of cores already and this is only from the last few years.\n\n\n> The problems have to get harder ergo more power/computation will be required and more data.\n\nNo, that\'s not how mining works.  Mining gets harder if their exchange price goes up because more people can afford to do mining.\nThe block rewards halve every 4 years so the amount of computing power required also halves at these times.\n\n\n> It can\'t develop without losing P2P infrastructure.\n\nPerhaps but so what?\n\n\n> It\'s useless it becomes redundant not scarce. Why? - If you replace the dollar with Bitcoin you don\'t have any more treasures.\nIf you replace a currency with Bitcoin you just change the name. Bitcoin will be affected by inflation if your economy depends on it. The price of Gold inflates because it\'s a precious metal used in modern technologies. \nGold is expensive because we rely on it, once we don\'t rely on it it will not be expensive. Bitcoin has none of these properties\n\nFirstly bitcoin is unlikely to ever replace a country\'s fiat currency, that\'s not it\'s goal here.  It is merely a digital money that can be used online where as fiat money must be done with paper or via a bank.  Think communication used to be done via talking to people (i.e. cash) or via delivering letters via a post office (i.e. trusted 3rd party you pay).  Bitcoin is to money what Email is to communication.\n\nGold\'s price is set mainly on it\'s market trade value, this is vastly higher than its intrinsic value.  Tungsten for instance has very similar properties to Gold, used in electronics too but their price is vastly different.\n\nIf someone thinks bitcoin\'s scarcity mixed with it\'s unique properties like instant global transfers, automated contracts, trustless network and escrow features don\'t derive any real tangible value in our internet age it will be an identical process explaining to a cat why a paper bank note has value beyond being kitty litter... their brains are still wired to money = fiat rather than money = value.\nIt\'s not too surprising as most of these people I\'ve encountered think a bank account interest of 2% is awesome even though inflation may be say 3% so essentially they\'re losing 1% of their value in the bank even though they have more money at the end of the year.  If they\'d have purchased an asset like a house outright they\'d have made 3% rather than -1%.\n': 3, 'Your friend has already made up his mind. Just say something like this: "okay, that\'s your opinion. Hundreds of thousands of people around the world disagree with you, and have for 6+ years now, but that\'s your own prerogative.

Most bitcoiners hope to "dump" in the far, far distant future when Bitcoin takes over the world. In the same vein, your parents buying stocks or mutual funds are also "pumping and dumping" since they do plan to cash out in 30-40 years.\n\n2. If 40 years from now we don\'t have widespread gigabit, there are more important problems to worry about than Bitcoin adoption. Also: Bitcoin can scale far more than the level 0 blockchain, as upcoming overlay technologies can provide a couple orders of magnitude improvement in accessibility (Lightning Network, for example).\n\n3. It\'s as anonymous as you want to be. Use HD wallet, don\'t reuse address, your anonymity immediately jumps a couple orders of magnitude, and it\'s free. Pay a tiny cost and do a few CoinJoins (/r/joinmarket) and your coins are freshly anonymous, no amount of computing power can trace to you with any certainty. For the bandwidth issue, see #2 (for full nodes). You don\'t even need a full node to use bitcoin, and using a lite protocol (say, Electrum) means you can totally do okay via dialup.\n\n4. See points above.\n\n5. See points above.\n\n6. See points above. \n\n7. See #3.\n\n8. See #3.

You keep mentioning that by choosing higher discounts on the flagship Name Your Own Discount program, "there is more risk of people trying to commit fraud." I think the truer statement is, "there is more likelihood of issues with the order." For a tentative, prospective new user, the *risk of fraud* terminology sends up all kinds of red flags; I think it\'s misleading and unnecessary.\n\nThe only fraud I\'ve read about in Purse topics is that of folks using fraudulent gift cards, and Purse closed the door on new orders for gift cards a few days ago. There are still some old orders on the board, but those are now designated with the card icon and working themselves off the order book rather quickly.\n\nSo it is that now -- and perhaps, always -- the more basic problem with higher discount orders is just that they present more issues to resolve and delays in order delivery. Fraud may be one of those issues, but it seems to be fading fast as Purse and Amazon come up with better ways to address it.\n\nI think the much larger disincentives for choosing higher discounts are: \n\n1) It takes longer for a buyer to step up on the other side of the exchange, agreeing to pay a larger premium for the bitcoin he/she wants to acquire. Purse is a marketplace; why should an "earner" (in their new terminology) pay a higher premium for a merchandise buyer\'s bitcoin, when there are other orders he could pick up with a lower premium?\n\n2) Those orders are more frequently picked up by poorly scored users (already rated down because of problems with previous orders), or first time users just dabbling in the service, not really intent on following through with the order process or paying for one\'s order.
