User says 'I have no clue, maybe he doesn't have one?' Coinbase says 'Oh ok, what is his email?'. User gives it. Coinbase sends an email to John saying John go make a FREE account by clicking this button, we have loaded it with bitcoin sent from your friend'.\n\nSounds great to me. What's the big deal? \n\nIf you want Coinbase to mail John saying 'Hey John someone is trying to send you bitcoin but we have no clue if you have a wallet, how about you go make one and let us know where to send this bitcoin to' then I think you're missing two points. \n\n1) 90% of the time doing it this way is slower, harder and more confusing and all together worse.\n2) If the user wanted to send bitcoin to John's non-Coinbase account, then the user can simply mail John himself and figure out his address. And vice versa, by the way. The option is still right there to simply send bitcoin to a wallet, rather than an email address.\n\nShould there be a middle ground in an ideal world, where Coinbase instead posts 'Click this link to redeem your bitcoin' which has 3 options: 1) sign in with Coinbase, 2) create a new account with Coinbase and 3) enter a bitcoin address to redeem the bitcoin to, instead of just the first two options? Yeah, sure. But again, that 3rd option is available by simply sending bitcoin to the address in the first place. They're not blocking this. It's like a grocery store letting you buy their branded bag at the counter to bring back home your groceries. Sure they don't let you buy another company's grocery bag then and there, but nobody stopped you from bringing your own. Same here. Nobody stops you from bringing your own wallet, but if you don't, they'll give you a free Coinbase wallet and you are free to withdraw the money immediately or reject it and mail your friend your wallet address as normal. \n\n**In short**: Coinbase isn't blocking anything, it's offering its own free product as a way of receiving money when no receiving wallet address was supplied. If a wallet address was supplied, then the money is simply sent there. No big deal.\n\n": 1, "It's entirely legitimate to post about a point of irritation in a public ~~form~~ forum in order to alert other consumers to potential problems with a service.

But a large percentage of the demand for invoicing service also want to convert to and from fiat which is illegal unless you are an MSB. So, coinbase is not in the wrong to provide a service that people want, especially if they are not bothered by the PII requirement which they\'ve already been trained to be accustomed to by Paypal and by absolutely everybody else that deals in moving fiat.\n\nI am not arguing that OP should not share what he has experienced, by all means he should. I will however argue that titles like "Coinbase is greedily blocking bitcoin freedom" are sensationalist clickbait bullshit. They are offering a service and the service has a requirement and even after learning this requirement the hard way nothing would prevent you taking your money back and going elsewhere.. **so nothing is blocked for anybody**.\n\nAdditionally, you are wrong about "the whole fucking point of bitcoin as a decentralized payment network". The point of the network is to provide a platform that anybody can build on and innovate with minimal friction and restriction. If they want to build systems to exchange with fiat, then out of band concerns will force them into strict MSB compliance. If they want to build services that dodge MSB compliance (whether legal or illegal in the larger scheme and thus dangerous to use or not) then they can do that too **and the former cannot stop them**.

Wild horses were tamed, like zebras can be, and were only made highly domesticated beyond that through selective breeding and training from birth.\n\nI shared my thoughts on it with you as I thought you might be interested, if you're not I don't care.": 1}, ('Anyone knows who are the insurers of Coinbase/Circle?

Yes, four:\n\n1) The supply of that product.\n\n2) The demand for that product.\n\n3) The supply of money.\n\n4) The demand to hold money.\n\nOf these, only the first and the third are relatively easy to quantify, which is why illiterate economists usually try to control price by controlling one of them. It never works.\n\nLet us consider a practical example, where "product" is Bitcoin and "money" is US dollars. Suppose that the price of Bitcoin starts rising "too fast" and we want to control that. (Let\'s leave aside for a moment the fact that nobody can really determine what "too fast" is, because different people have different preferences.) What can we do? Can we control the supply of available Bitcoins? Yes, we can increase the block reward. But what if the price is rising because demand for Bitcoin is so strong that it overwhelms our efforts and even if we release all the possible Bitcoins in one go, buyers still keep bidding for them? Or what if the price of Bitcoin is rising because the Fed is printing like there is no tomorrow and the US economy has entered hyperinflation? Or what if it is rising because people have lost faith in the US dollar and want to get rid of it, despite that the Fed has stopped creating new dollars? You can\'t control all that, ergo you can\'t control the price of Bitcoin.\n\nThe same impossibility exists in the opposite direction. Suppose that the price of Bitcoin is falling "too fast" and we want to stop that. What are we going to do? We can decrease the block reward - but we can\'t reduce the number of Bitcoins already in existence (unless they are in our possession, of course - then we can just destroy the private keys controlling them). Just like gold - almost all of the already mined product is still in existence, available for the right price. Even if all mining stops completely, there still will be supply available. If people decide to stop trusting Bitcoin, they will want to get rid of their coins and will offer their supply of them at any price. Thus, curtailing the supply of new Bitcoins cannot control crashing demand for the product. Or suppose that the economy has entered a deflationary collapse and people desperately need money to pay off their debts and buy food. In order to get money (US dollars in our example), they will be willing to sell anything, including Bitcoin. Thus, the increased demand to hold money will overwhelm the lack of new supply of the product.\n\nTL;DR, you can\'t control the price of a product for a long period of time - especially not by controlling just one of the 4 factors that form it. Just let the free market decide (dynamically!) what the price should be at any given moment and stop with the stupidity already!\n\nP.S. The volatility of Bitcoin price will stop bothering you if you stop thinking of it as "money" or "investment". Think of it as a cost-efficient *payment method*. This is what all these companies that "accept Bitcoin payment" do - they don\'t keep a single Bitcoin; they just use (via third-party) the blockchain as a payment transfer mechanism to get their preferred currency (US dollars or whatever) for the product they are selling.': 0, 'Well, lets not go too far!

What does it matter that over the course of a day/week/month the value changes if the computational power required to assign that value is inimical to the Bitcoin process, and each Bitcoin can be subdivided with the kind of precision that would be unthinkable for any other currency.\n\n- IF YOU FUCK WITH THE SUPPLY PART OF THE ALGORITHM, BITCOIN (and every other iteration of crypto, I might add) WILL DIE!!!\n\nThose would have been nice cherries to put there, but they weren't.

That's why your quotes were so easy to twist.": 1, '> absolute downfall of Vitalik Buterin\n\nAre you judging /u/vbuterin by that one paragraph or do you have other evidence for this?': 1, 'Not just this one paragraph, no. But this one paragraph, if true, really does indicate the degree to which he has divorced himself from Bitcoin.': 2, 'Just stopped by to point out that the dates on the chart are off by 4 years. ': 1, "You know what, for transparency purposes I'll put down my entire reply to Coindesk. Particularly see the last paragraph:\n\n\n> How damaging is the current volatility of bitcoin compared to many Fiat currencies?\n\nI would argue that it's a rather large inconvenience, for several reasons:\n\n(1) People are used to currency being stable and predictable in value, and tend to be risk-averse. They do not want to put their funds into a currency when its value could completely disappear by next year. This is probably the main argument against Bitcoin that I see repeated time and time again in the media. I quote the latest anti-Bitcoin troll Ken Hess ( http://frugalnetworker.com/2014/03/24/twitter-and-the-internet-of-fake-things/ ):\n\n> Remember that standard gigs on fiverr.com are $5.\n\n> Here are three of my Bitcoin transactions with fiverr.com:\n\n-0.00786 BTC\n-0.007965 BTC\n-0.00828 BTC\n> You see, each time you buy something with Bitcoin, the amount changes because the \xe2\x80\x9cvalue\xe2\x80\x9d of Bitcoin constantly changes. Unfortunately, not always in your favor, as you can see by mine. There is also a small fee for carrying out the transaction. I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure how much it is in Dollars or Bitcoins because I didn\xe2\x80\x99t pay a lot of attention.\n\n> The problem is that if you use Dollars to pay for something and the amount is $5, you pay $5 on whatever day it is. Not so with Bitcoin. As you can see, I paid three different amounts of Bitcoin each time, although the value of the transaction was $5. Well, $5 in Dollars, that is.\n\n> This is one of the strongest arguments against Bitcoin. \n\nAnd he is only one of many dozens that I've seen making this point.\n\n(2) Tax considerations. If you have a stablecoin that maintains its value perfectly with respect to some local fiat, then you don't need to deal with the accounting issues around capital gains. With bitcoin, you very much do.  \n(3) It discourages businesses from holding on to BTC, making it much more difficult for network effect scenarios to emerge where a company receives some of its revenue in BTC, holding on to it, and then using it to pay employees. Businesses want exactly zero exposure, making BTC act in many cases purely as a payment processor for the USD.  \n\nAs a side point, I think that the cryptocurrency community needs to be very clear that there is a difference between _Bitcoin_ and _cryptocurrency_, and it is perfectly reasonable to be critical of the specific features of Bitcoin but very excited about cryptocurrency as a category; many journalists outside the space don't seem to understand this point.\n\n> Is bitcoin in a stage of transition from a speculative asset to a non-speculative unit of exchange? How can we nurture it as it makes the transition?\n\nNope. It's going to be speculative forever IMO. The closest parallel to BTC in terms of characteristics is gold, and gold has been about 4x more volatile than fiat currencies with respect to each other (in the past 10 years, the ratio of max to min gold/USD is about 4.6, whereas between any two mainstream fiat currencies it's pretty much always under 1.7). Now, can it be a unit of exchange? Sure, it already is (although I see its long term role as basically being a speculative crisis insurance asset, replacing gold, as it actually is superior to gold in many ways and doesn't have any clear downsides; even its wasteful PoW algorithm is substantially less wasteful than gold mining, as gold mining in addition to having a wasteful private cost of digging metal out of the ground also has strong negative environmental externalities). But for an asset to be truly stable and non-speculative it needs to have a variable supply that adjusts to market conditions. \n\n> From your paper, I understand that tempering the price of bitcoin using internal network metrics rather than external influences is the best course of action, is that correct?\n\nBoth approaches have their advantage. I would argue that the endogenous stabilization approach is more appropriate for a foundational cryptocurrency like bitcoin because it doesn't introduce implicit dependencies on specific institutions (eg. targeting USD parity would essentially give the Federal Reserve control over Bitcoin); the exogenous approach may be more appropriate for separate chains that want to launch their own low-cost stable asset because they need an internal token whose value does not jump around too much.\n\n>  It has been argued before that a small number of players exerts inordinate control over bitcoin. Would the implementation of a monetary policy based on some form of decentralised metric help to alleviate that?\n\nIt depends a lot on how the new units produced by the monetary policy are distributed. I don't think it would change things too much; centralization is mostly a separate problem from volatility, although reduced volatility may reduce centralization among exchanges because even smaller exchanges would be able to have lower bid/ask spreads if the price jumps around less wildly.\n\n> The Seignorage Shares paper calls for a crypto currency with a rule that makes the supply of coins elastic, as a means of adjusting a coin's price. Is this a good idea, and if not, why?\n\nSo, we know that price = supply / demand (roughly; it's true for currencies at least). Demand is unpredictable. Hence, you can either stabilize supply and have an unpredictable price, or stabilize price and have an unpredictable supply. My view is that no one cares about supply (how many people even know how many USD there are in circulation?) but people do care about price, so stabilizing price is more important, and that requires having the supply be adjustable based on price via some metric.\n\n> Is this the kind of thing that could be coded into the bitcoin protocol? If not, would we need some kind of side-coin? A kind of second token, which we could use as a form of trade to regulate bitcoin's price somehow?\n\nUnfortunately, we can't use another token to regulate Bitcoin's price. In order to stabilize the price of Bitcoin, we need to regulate the supply of _Bitcoin_, as per the formula above. Using another token will not do the trick. \n\n> The Japanese paper talks about the form of monetary policy that is decentralised. Should bitcoin be completely unfettered and left to the whims of the market, or should we have some form of systematic monetary policy  based on decentralised metrics?\n\n**My view, as I've stated above, is that Bitcoin is fine the way it is as an asset that will hopefully replace current economic functions of gold. I think Bitcoin will perform best if it is left to be conservative and do its thing well, and allow other networks to take on the functions of trying to be stable currencies, super-efficient scalable payment networks, etc. Trying to be innovative would also make Bitcoin more fragile, potentially compromising its role as gold 2.0** (although lately I have started looking into some possibilities for how the Bitcoin value pool can be leveraged to do a sort of shared decentralized proof of stake for other networks, there are some interesting possibilities there; see https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/11/13/scalability-part-3-metacoin-history-multichain/ )": 3, "I'd rather buy Kanyecoin, at least it's purpose designed and doesn't promise to tie your shoelaces.": 1, "Although I disagree about monetary policy, what you're saying makes a lot more sense than what was presented in the article.

The value has risen (popularity, increased scarcity, a random idiot buying above price,...), but you probably won't sell everything to 1 person.\n\nNow let's be realistic, 1 person will be like you and buy for 35.100 dollar of BTC which means he will get only 3.51 BTC. This is a market price, in this case everyone is happy.\n\nThe only person you took 965.000dollar from is the person you bought it from in the first place.

I guess you are thinking that if the economy is a zero-sum game, you don't get rich without making others poor.\n\nBut in this case you don't take a lot of money from one person.

For you to extract value you need more and more people to extract the value FROM. Later adopters need to give earlier adopters more money with the expectation that even later adopters will then give them money. This can not go on forever for obvious reasons. ': -4, 'The 1%': 0, "I agree with you that we extract value from the last people who get in, the fiat and fiat debt holders. Bitcoin is acting as expanding the monetary base. So there is more money chasing the same goods and services. The absolute amount the last holders of fiat and fiat debt will lose will depend on the preference of bitcoin against fiat, which will show as fiat-bitcoin exchange rate.\n\nBut central banks are inflating money anyway. At 5% inflation rate for 60 years, holders of fiat would lose 95% of its purchasing power.\n\nYou can take solace that at least with the emergence of bitcoin, this will be the last time that it will happen. In some way the biggest losers are the banks because bitcoin strips their power to print money. Of course they won't lose stocks and commodity futures they hold and get poor. But we took away their power of robbing our savings in money. This tap is closed for them. :D\n\nMore about the losers, and here I am less sure, since there is actually 10 times more bonds then fiat. This means that bond holder are the ones losing more. Which I believe are pension funds, insurance companies, banks and some rich individuals. But nobody is stupid, they have a reasonable diversification. So even if their bonds evaporate they still have stock and commodities. Therefore, depending on the quality of their managers, their loss is capped.": 1, 'The economic system as a whole creates value. Sometimes this happens by people literally making a valuable thing. Sometimes, intermediaries do something that makes an existing thing a lot more valuable. I.e., in the 19th century, traders would go to places where they had heard that e.g. wheat was cheap, and take it to places where they had heard that it was needed. They were excoriated by various people for \'parasitically\' profiting without actually making anything, but if you think about the risks involved in making this kind of trade at a time when communication was rudimentary compared to today, it seems pretty clear to me that they were creating a lot of value by transforming (wheat where it\'s not needed) into (wheat where people need it.)\n\nLikewise, the people who created e.g. ways for people to get the money to make this kind of trade, capital markets, and economic instruments more generally created value. So did the various mercantile exchanges that finally replaced some of the functions of individual traders, and allowed farmers to sell their products on a central exchange, and to keep more of the profits. \n\nSo: suppose you contrast a world without trade to a world with trade. People are much richer in a world with trade, Why? Because stuff gets where it\'s needed; because as a result more stuff is produced; etc. Note that the fact that more stuff is produced is not the sole reason that value increases. Does this mean that trade "creates value out of thin air"? Not if that means that the creation of value is just a trick.\n\nIf, somehow, BTC goes to the moon, that will presumably be because it is useful for some very important reason. It will enable kinds of economic activity that would not have been possible, or as convenient, otherwise. In so doing, it will create value, but that won\'t be "creating it out of thin air", at least not in any sense that implies that this creation is somehow illegitimate.': 2, "From the things the guy who bought the car makes money off.\n\nUnless the guy who bought the car needed a loan to buy the car, in that case it's created out of thin air, and indirectly makes all holders of the currency slightly poorer.": 1, "How is it theft?

But doesn't mean that those other people necessraily lost in an aboslute sense\n\nFurthermore, lets look as some numbers for a sense of magnitude.   The world GDP is $60T  per year.  the total money supply (best guess for bitcoins future value) is also about $60T, but is relatively fixed.   So if it took 20 years for mass adoption, we have $60T*20 = $1.2 Quadrillion in wealth created over that time period (in real terms).  \n\nBitcoin would still be at that $60T number so only about 60/1200= 5% of the wealth created.  Not going to be a huge factor ": 1, 'We can fix the analogy by assuming that international trade would eventually rely on 1940s Aston Martin parts.

Now we have houses and cars and stuff.  Who did we make poorer to get all this stuff?"\n\nNo one.  The economy is not a zero sum game.\n\nBitcoin does compete with banks and payment processors, but it will probably open up entirely new markets also. So some people may lose when bitcoin gains but overall there will be a net gain.': 10, 'Wealth is transferred, not destroyed during a major financial crisis/revolution.  In the case of bitcoin, I believe a skyrocket in price that leads to the type of wealth you are describing would be linked to something like the collapse of the US dollar as the global reserve currency.\n\nAs for your argument about people buying in after you did, the same could be said for any stock investment.': 1, 'The guy who bought the car obviously.': 1, "Sure someone paid for it, but they wouldn't have if they didn't think it was worth it. Where did the value come from, and do you honestly think selling a car is a form of theft?": 2, 'banks': 5, 'Where does the wealth come from?  This is an interesting question because the answer isn\'t the same as for gold.  Several factors:\n\n* dollar inflation will create some part of those dollars out of thin air, making everyone who believes in dollars poorer (just like gold)\n\n* the things you - or robots - can do with bitcoins will create wealth, even though some of this wealth will manifest as price deflation\n\n* billions (2.5) of people without access to PayPal or regular banking will have fast reliable economic connections, making the products available to you better, and creating wealth\n\n* the wealth you create by not standing in line at Western Union (whether you then cook your own dinner or sell more widgets) will decrease your preference for existing dollars, making them cheaper to you\n\n* wealth created by people who are not ultimately working within the US financial system will gradually strengthen Bitcoin\'s trade-weighted prices, and make bitcoins scarcer on markets that exchange for dollars\n\n* people will regain some personal control of the 8.6% of US GDP (well over a trillion dollars) that falls into the financial sector\n\n* governments will have less customers buying bonds, and their cost of borrowing (which most of them successfully ignore) will go up, which will increase inflation pressure\n\n* "people that got in later" will pay higher prices because the world is always in transition to the best store of value available, and Bitcoin changed the game the moment it was announced\n\nEven though there are some elements of price deflation here, I accept your premise that Bitcoin\'s scarcity will result in upward-trending BTCUSD; mostly due to the network effects of money.\n\nThe key perspective is that the dynamics of a shift to a better store of value (whatever value is to humans) are as rich as the underlying transactions exchanging value.  It is the essence of progress.  It is not zero-sum, but it is not wholly outside of the realm of competition, either.\n\nKeep in mind that at every point, everyone who participates does so because they believe it can help them, in that moment.  From that perspective, nobody coming to Bitcoin late is losing out (provided they take a mature viewpoint on their investment risk, and don\'t put themselves in a position where they can\'t accept the possible consequences).\n': 1, 'It\'s important to be precise with our words. OP was starting with the premise that we might be "making" others poor by having an appreciation in btc value. I for one, can\'t think of other implications than theft when wording in that fashion. At the very least it suggests a sort of immorality. Obviously we don\'t consider a car dealership immoral or "making us poor" because we decided to buy car, even if we needed one to get to work. I don\'t see how Bitcoin appreciation would be different from any other asset.': 1}}}
