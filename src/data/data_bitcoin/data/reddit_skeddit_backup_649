Anyone using an old client was disconnected from the rest of the network, and they were vulnerable to similar double-spending attacks. The reason that no one noticed this change (most people here probably haven't even heard of it) is that the change was programmed into the client 2 years in advance. You'd have to be using a client that was released over 2 years ago to be left on the old network. This is how the max block size will be increased, hopefully with the same 2-year delay. By the time the change actually happens, everyone will be using a client with the new rules because that's the only type of client that will have been advertised on bitcoin.org and elsewhere for 2+ years. You'd have to go massively out of your way to download a version without the new rules.\n\nI think that the max block size hardfork will proceed smoothly as long as it is unanimously supported by the core devs and no more than a handful of really big Bitcoin businesses/communities decide to explicitly oppose it.\n\n(I don't especially support Gavin's proposal because I think that it increases block sizes too quickly, but I think that some 2-year-delayed *very conservative* increase in max block size should be added ASAP.)": 106, 'Exactly!

If the bad guys have access to that key, your car will stay, for only as long as it takes the bad guys to punch that pin code and drive off to a new address (10 minutes, tops).\n\nThis means, online wallets are only as safe as their competency in keeping hackers at bay, and the level of trustworthiness of those running it.

This is the same method used to find a paper checkbook balance.  The difference with bitcoin is that every transaction for every address since bitcoin was created is on the block chain, and anyone who wants it can get a copy.\n\nEvery full copy of the bitcoin software checks the hash values and transaction signatures of the entire block chain on its own.  Therefore it does not need to trust anyone else to verify integrity of the data and find the balance of any address.\n\nNetwork nodes also keep a "memory pool" of recently arrived transactions that are not yet in a block, so they have an up-to-the second history.  That prevents people spending the same balance twice.': 3, "I didn't mean to give the impression that it was about persons, but you are right.\n\nAnd technically transactions aren't even about addresses.

Remember it's still very early days, like the Internet was in 1994. \n\n**Regarding transaction limit:** the actual numbers IIRC are 12 transactions/second limit for Bitcoin currently (it will be slowly raised, the question is how to do it best) and the capacity of Visa network is more like 40000 transactions/second, usually reached during black friday.\n\nActually it's been tested that the regular high-end desktop PC could easily and securely process more than 40 000 transactions per second on the Bitcoin network, which is quite something when you consider that Visa spends up to 40% of it's earnings on server farms that sustain 40000t/s capacity. \n\n**Regarding privacy of buying a dildo:** actually you'd probably more likely use cash to pay for that. And i'd say the bigger issue here is that you have to fill out forms and hand over your whole identity whenever you have to pay for anything over the Internet. \n\n**Regarding useless hashes:** For Bitcoin it's i think 150 mW/h globally at the moment. Compare that with the costs of digging, extracting, melting, transporting and storing of gold. Just because a certain metal have pretty good qualities as a store of value for us. And a fun fact: there's est. 100x more paper gold than physical gold circulating on the markets. \n\n**Fees:** For Bitcoin it's $0,03 whatever the size of transaction, for WU or PayPal it's for instance 7% from USA to Venezuela. That's why servers are much better than human institutions: they are much more trust-worthy (when they are in the for of block chains at least) and cheaper to run. \n\nIntermediaries are existing just because previously we couldn't figure how to do it any other way. The firms like PayPal, Western Union, Visa or MasterCard exist **for the sole purpose of allowing us to pay each other**, and they became very big institutions collecting huge fees just to exist. They don't make any product at all. \n\nTL;DR: Yes, we've heard all those arguments, they are of no real concern. \n": 3, "> Chargebacks are very valueable for consumers.\n\nHow valuable are chargebacks to you when you shop at Amazon, Target, Walmart, or any other large established retailer?  Because for me they are useless, since I know I can always return the item. As for smaller retailers, if chargebacks really are very valuable for consumers, then consumers will just pay for them in the form of fraud insurance or multisig arbiter.\n\n> the hard limit is 7 per second, and if you do the math, its actually 4/second right now.\n\nSo? Who cares? We're nowhere near using that up, and it will be raised to 80/second soon, then more as needed.\n\n> >Instant confirmations are possible on a number of ways.\n\n> Not unless you centralize.\n\nI send a signed transaction to merchant through BIP70, merchant tacks on a fee, and transmits it directly to mining pools whom he has a contract with, who agree not to accept any other transactions from the same address the merchant submits. Double spends almost impossible, since miners will reject any attempts to do it. Where's the centralization?\n\n>> regular high-end desktop PC could easily and securely process more than 40 000 transactions per second\n\n> It doesn't take into account a) the block time,\n\nWho cares? See previous paragraph.\n\n> b) because of block time and 4 txns/sec, your txn gets put in the back of the queue and you may have to wait several blocks for it to be processed,\n\nNo, by the time 44,000 txns/sec are needed, blocks will be big enough to accept them.\n\n> c) the time needed for a block to propogate across the whole network.\n\nBlock doesn't have to propagate, just transactions that are being broadcast and the 80kb header hash. Thesis being implemented now, where once you mine a block, all you broadcast is the 80k header, since all other nodes and miners have heard of the broadcast transactions already.\n\n> So even when awesome bitcoins is (in your hypothetical universe) taken over the world, I'd still pay cash\n\nDon't listen to him. You would pay bitcoins, and no one, including your boss, will know you are buying dildos. Bitcoin is plenty anonymous (look how many millions of dollars worth were stolen, and how many were recovered), and many of those anonymizing features are being built into consumer wallets to work by default in the background.\n\n> Gold is not the currency anywhere, idiot\n\nExcept for in countries who use it to settle payments of hundreds of millions of dollars (China, India, Russia, likely a few European countries sometimes)\n\n> If the whole world was running on Awesome Bitcoins, it would be an enormous pollutant which would massively fuck up the world\n\nIt would still waste less electricity and resources than banks. Mining also creates a huge incentive to get as much power for as little as possible, since efficient miners can earn more than wasteful miners, so miners will be forced to create more efficient renewable electric generating technology (mining for free on wind, wave, and solar), which will be used by everyone else. Miners also already created a huge push to get 24nm processor tech out almost a year sooner than planned (was supposed to come out inNovember, ASICs got it out in March), so mining will give us faster processor too.\n\n > And its a highly inefficient solution which requires 1000 computers with power consuming GPUs\n\nGPUs!? What is this, 2011?\n\n> Absolutely false.\n\nCheck your prices again. WU is higher than you claim. Also note that PayPal doesn't even let you send to most of the world. Places like India and much of Eastern Europe only allow sending money within the country, not receiving it from abroad.\n\n>> The firms like PayPal, Western Union, Visa or MasterCard exist for the sole purpose of allowing us to pay each other\n\n> So does the Awesome Bitcoin network.\n\nYou forgot things like owning value by holding private key, multisig, notarizing with the blockchain, micro transaction channels, it being the first time software can hold and spend money on its own, and probably a dozen other things.\n\n> you do pay txn fees for them, which will only go up once there are no more coins to mine, otherwise miners will have no incentive to keep the network running.\n\nI assume you can math, right? So what is\n\n1 * 25 vs 20,000 * 0.00125\n\nAre those numbers the same? The first is 25 transactions each paying a whole bitcoin fee. The second is 20,000 transactions paying a 0.00125 fee.

The fees OR the volume has to go up, and if adoption increases, the volume will go up.": 2, '> transaction fees through bitcoin will eventually have to support miners and will be much higher than $0.03 each.\n\nWhy will they be much higher?

Blackmail Bob could try propose a transaction where Sam only loses 0.9S (which is taken by Blackmail Bob, so he would have a net gain of 0.9S). Sam would be tempted to accept this since that way he will be better off than emitting TX S1 by 0.1S.\n> \n> Blackmail Bob has a problem, though: if the incentive he provides Sam is too low Sam might not accept this blackmail and he might end up losing S, and if the incentive he provides Sam is too high, he will basically make no money out of the attack.\n> \n> Other than that, there are more practical reasons why this attack is not feasible.

He is considered the leading custodian of the bitcoin code, the rules and software used to run the cryptocurrency. But far\nfrom being a cheerleader, Mr Andresen, is warning ordinary people to avoid bitcoin \xe2\x80\x94 for now.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt actually is dangerous and people should be aware it\xe2\x80\x99s like the early internet,\xe2\x80\x9d he tells the Financial Times.\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you lived through time, you remember lots of press articles came out saying don\xe2\x80\x99t give internet\ncompanies your credit card details.

At its peak, bitcoin was traded\nfor $1,240 on the Mt Gox exchange, the Japanese group that filed for bankruptcy last year after losing about\n$450m worth of bitcoin in a cyber attack. According to Coindesk, the bitcoin news site, the price is now about $283.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBitstamp is handling the incident well,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr Andresen says, by being transparent and explaining to customers what happened. \xe2\x80\x9cI hope\nthey take the time to publish a complete postmortem on details of the attack, so other exchanges can learn from their mistakes.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope Mt Gox does the same because we still don\xe2\x80\x99t know what happened.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nMr Andresen is considered the prot\xc3\xa9g\xc3\xa9 to \xe2\x80\x9cSatoshi Nakamoto\xe2\x80\x9d, the name adopted by the supposed inventor of bitcoin. After collaborating\non the project over email, Mr Andresen was given Mr Nakamoto\xe2\x80\x99s blessing to become the \xe2\x80\x9ccore maintainer\xe2\x80\x9d of the bitcoin source code,\nworking full time on the project.\n\nWhile Nakamoto appears to have vanished, Mr Andresen wields huge influence on the development of the currency. He helped to found\nthe Bitcoin Foundation in 2012 and groups from financial regulators to the CIA seek his advice.\n\nHis knowledge of bitcoin has led to suggestions he may actually be Nakamoto. \xe2\x80\x9cI am not Satoshi,\xe2\x80\x9d he laughs.\n\xe2\x80\x9cAsk any geek. Point them to code written by Satoshi and point them to code written by me. You can tell,\nthey\xe2\x80\x99re not the same guy.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHis theory is that the inventor is \xe2\x80\x9ca young academic type, somewhere in the world. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think Japan.\nPerhaps the British Isles actually because in Satoshi\xe2\x80\x99s communications he [used British rather than\nAmerican spellings]. I think there\xe2\x80\x99s an academic thinking about other stuff, sitting on a big pile of bitcoin.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe one person who Mr Andresen says is definitely not Satoshi Nakamoto is Dorian S. Nakamoto, the\nJapanese\xc2\xadAmerican engineer that Newsweek named as bitcoin\xe2\x80\x99s inventor last year. Mr Nakamoto, who lives\nin California, denies any role in bitcoin.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s not the Satoshi I talked to,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr Andresen. \xe2\x80\x9cI feel sorry for Dorian that so much personal attention\ngot focused on this person. That shows why the actual Satoshi has worked so hard to stay anonymous.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHis influence at the Bitcoin Foundation could soon increase, after it emerged Jim Harper, its global policy\ncounsel, was dismissed earlier this month. The move is seen as a shift in focus for the non\xc2\xadprofit group away from policy and regulation\nand back towards developing bitcoin\xe2\x80\x99s core technology.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is always hard when an organisation pivots and priorities change,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cEffective organisations have a\nclear mission and focus and there is plenty of work to be done on the technical front to keep the foundation\nbusy.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThough Mr Andresen concedes bitcoin remains in the early days of its development, he is confident it will\nmature, noting that more than $300m of venture money had been invested in bitcoin start\xc2\xadups in 2014.\n\nMr Andresen is also at the forefront of efforts to ready the virtual currency for wider use. As it is currently\ndesigned, the bitcoin network can process just seven transactions a second. By comparison, Visa is capable of\nhandling close to 50,000 transaction a second at peak times.\n\nMr Andresen\xe2\x80\x99s proposed solution is to increase the size of bitcoin blocks, the files that hold the data that\nunderpins the currency. Their size limits the speed at which the bitcoin network can process transactions.\nLarger blocks can contain more transactions and, therefore, increase the capacity of the network.\n\nBut there are concerns that increasing the block size will put a strain on the network. Bigger blocks packed\nwith more transactions requires transmitting and storing more data. This may also make it difficult for hobbyists to store a full copy of the\n\xe2\x80\x9cblockchain\xe2\x80\x9d, centralising power in the hands of corporations that can afford expensive servers in big data centres.\n\nThe issue is being debated by bitcoin developers. But Mr Andresen says that \xe2\x80\x9cwe\xe2\x80\x99re really close to consensus\xe2\x80\x9d to approve his proposal, a\nmove that \xe2\x80\x9cin 20 years, would allow us to have enough capacity to handle every single electronic transaction in the world\xe2\x80\x9d.\n\nWhile Mr Andresen tries to prepare bitcoin for mass usage, he advises caution to investors. He holds thousands of bitcoins, enough to\nretire comfortably. But he has been cashing them in slowly, investing in stock market funds instead.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBitcoin is wild and crazy investment that I\xe2\x80\x99m diversifying out of all the time,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cIf bitcoin is wildly successful, I\xe2\x80\x99m still holding on\nto a good chunk of bitcoin. It could be worth tens of millions of dollars, but it could be worth zero. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make sense to hold more\nthan that amount. I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a desire to be a multi\xc2\xadbillionaire.
