If you accept common payment methods as a store, you have no control over how your customers pay - debit or credit, foreign or domestic.

And that is also why customers who pay with domestic debit cards also pay for the cost of foreign credit cards, through a general increase in prices.\n\nSecondly. Here in Denmark, which is very much a part of the EU, you pay between 1.5% (domestic debit card) and 3.75% (foreign credit card) in transaction fees ([Source in danish](http://www.epay.dk/download/?file=prisliste-teller-international-betalingskort)).

I've run out of objections :-)\n\nSeriously, thanks so much for answering all of those, you've obviously put a lot of time and thought into it.  Certainly enough to get over my superficial understanding.\n\nI stand corrected.\n": 1, "> I understand you only need public keys on the server side to create the P2SH. But a hash is not a key -- public/private keys are a pair.\n\nWe're not talking about a hash here, the MPK allows us to generate the full public keys that match the private keys of the user wallet.\n\n> Are you saying the password in the client-side is scrypt-hashed and that is used as a private key, from which you generate a public key, which is in turn sent to the server? So you've implemented public key cryptography in the client-side JavaScript?\n\nYes, basically! Only that we don't do it with a single keypair but use the resulting hash as a BIP32 wallet seed, so we can derive multiple keypairs from the same seed. And we don't send each individual public key to the server, but the MPK which allows the server to generate them. (Edit: Actually, we don't use the password hash as the seed directly. The seed is random and is encrypted with the scrypt hash of the password, before being sent to be stored on the server)\n\nWe're using the Stanford Javascript Crypto Library and BitcoinJS to do the hashing, key derivation, and signing in the browser.\n\nDoes that clear it up?\n\n> Can I make an additional suggestion for your site then, with the above in mind? You shouldn't just show the P2SH hash -- you need to show the script, and make it possible for us to check the script's hash that we're sending to. Otherwise there is nothing to stop you from making any script you like (obviously I'm not saying you're not trustworthy, I just like systems to not rely on trustworthiness) -- a script which isn't necessarily the 2-of-3 script we think it is.\n\nThis is a valid point, we're still working on that front. We wanted to get the hot wallet off of our server as soon as possible and decided to launch as soon as it's secure and usable. As I said making it more transparent for the users is definitely the next step. We'll show you the whole transaction you're about to sign (decoded by the javascript) and also some details like which keys are involved in the p2sh address, etc.\n\n> Additionally: you should do as blockchain do and open source your cryptographic key management code so that that can be verified -- possibly with a browser extension. Remember that JavaScript is inherently impossible to secure 100%, since another script can always undo the work of a previous one.\n\nAlso on the agenda. We're aware of the security limitations of javascript; going forward we'll be looking for ways to interact with local wallet clients to do the signing. But it seems it might be a while until this works conveniently and is supported everywhere.": 3, '> But we don\'t have your password. Actually, your password never leaves your browser.\n>\n> using the "scrypt" algorithm - which makes it pretty much impossible for us to brute-force your "wallet-password" from the "login-password" our server knows.\n\nOkay, that makes sense.  You\'ll have to forgive me though, I\'m still not quite sure I\'m convinced of the security.\n\n> When you sign up, we take your password + email and run it through scrypt twice (with a different prefix so we get different results). One of the results is used as the "Login Token" and the other one as the "Seed Password" to encrypt the newly generated wallet.\n\nThe problem is that hashing is not public key cryptography.  While you might not be storing my password, you are storing (or at least are receiving a copy of) my "hash-of-password-to-be-used-for-escrow-key".  So you still have the magic number.\n\nIt\'s your server that is creating the P2SH script, not my browser -- that\'s essential because you need to add in _your_ secret, which obviously my browser cannot know.  You must be getting a copy of the socalled "seed password" -- and that means you have 2 of 3 tokens at the time of P2SH creation.\n\n> To login, your browser only has to compute the login token, and send that to the server. The seed password is only computed when you want to sign a transaction, and never leaves the browser.\n\nExcept that isn\'t true -- the "seed password" is used on two occasions, not one.\n\n - Creation of the P2SH script\n - Redemption of the P2SH script\n\nFor the second of these, I can see that you can do that with no knowledge of my secret, assuming the in-browser work stays in-browser.  But how are you creating that P2SH script in the first place without knowledge of the secret?\n\n---\n\nIt strikes me that there is a further danger: if you are hashing a password in the client and using that as a login password -- it doesn\'t matter that we can\'t get back to the password from the hash, since the hash _is_ the password as far as the server is concerned.  Hashed login passwords are only properly secure if the hashing is done server side -- hence the server _always_ sees the "plaintext" password, it\'s just that the plaintext password in this case is a hash.\n\n---\n\nEdit: incidentally, I\'m happy to be wrong, I\'d be delighted.  I\'m not trying to be objectionable, I\'m trying to understand.': 3, 'Hello,\n\nBrawker developer here.\n\nYou\'re absolutely right, if we have your password, we can decrypt your seed and therefore get your money, because we also have one key.\n\nBut we don\'t have your password. Actually, your password never leaves your browser.\n\nThe simple way would be to require two different passwords, one for login and one to decrypt the wallet seed. But we can save you the trouble, and just derive two different passwords from the one you enter, using the "scrypt" algorithm - which makes it pretty much impossible for us to brute-force your "wallet-password" from the "login-password" our server knows.\n\nHere\'s how this works: https://imgur.com/Mdg2wXL\n\nWhen you sign up, we take your password + email and run it through scrypt twice (with a different prefix so we get different results). One of the results is used as the "Login Token" and the other one as the "Seed Password" to encrypt the newly generated wallet.\n\nTo login, your browser only has to compute the login token, and send that to the server. The seed password is only computed when you want to sign a transaction, and never leaves the browser.\n\nWe will keep working on making the multisig process more transparent and even more trustworthy, and also add a blog post with a more detailed explanation soon.': 5, 'Marketing gimmick\n\nEnjoy a donuthole on me /u/changetip': -1, 'Creating the p2sh script doesn\'t require any private keys, only the public ones. We get those by also exporting the Master Public Key (MPK) of the wallet when it is created and storing it on the server. (That\'s not shown in the diagram). This allows us to generate the appropriate public keys on the server without user interaction and without knowing the wallet seed or password for it.\n\nYou\'re right of course that we have the hash of the original password, but the basic function of a hash is to be one way, so we can\'t "calculate" the password from the hash, only try different passwords and see if we get the same hash ("brute force" attack). That\'s why we are using scrypt to make this a lot harder for us - we\'d have to compute a lot of hashes to check each single password, and it also adds a memory-intensiveness factor that limits it being parallelized.\nIt\'s a bit like BIP38 private key protection, where even simple passwords take a long time to brute-force.\n\nAs far as the login is concerned, yes, if someone can read your traffic to the server, they can use the password you sent to login. But this is the same for most sites, only that the password is sent in plaintext normally. On the backend, we treat the login token like a regular password and hash it again before we store it in our db.

Its own staff members had inserted into the PATRIOT Act a new clause stating that it could designate any financial institution anywhere as being of "primary money laundering concern". This was effectively a death warrant for the institution in question. However, no requirements were put on these designations. No evidence, process or really anything was needed. And people like Zarate were determined to go home and tell the wifey that they were brave freedom fighters keeping America safe.\n\nThe book details their titanic screwups in enormous detail, which is kind of amazing because it is written by one of the guys most responsible. Even now he can\'t see how awful the book makes him look.\n\nFor example, your quote talks about Saudi banks. The Treasury liked to designate foreign banks as being key players in global terror networks based on ...... no evidence at all. Or sometimes just a single account. Yet it expected everyone to immediately cut ties with those banks on their say so.\n\nOne notorious case (documented in Zarate\'s book) involved a very old and respected US bank that happened to have many foreign embassies as clients. Zarate\'s team at the Treasury Dept decided that foreign embassies of middle eastern countries were inherently suspicious. No real justification for this view is provided in the book - they just felt sure those embassies were up to no good. So they designated the bank as of "prime money laundering concern" under their PATRIOT Act powers and it went bankrupt. Of course, now the US is screwed because suddenly lots of foreign embassies don\'t have bank accounts anymore and can\'t pay their employees. What\'s more, no other bank will touch them because they\'re afraid of the hit men at the Treasury. Cue minor diplomatic crisis. Eventually the State Dept had to intervene and give some other banks assurances that they wouldn\'t be prosecuted or forcibly bankrupted by taking on the embassies. All those embassies (except Cuba I think) got bank accounts back. So, net result: one dead US bank. No other impact. Repercussions on the Treasury staff who did this: none, because even though it was widely recognised as an epic fail, they were just fighting terrorists y\'see? And in wars mistakes happen.\n\nIn short, after reading this book, I really can\'t see American statements about banks being involved in terrorist financing as anything meaningful.

[doing business with terrorist organizations was another.](http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/gangster-bankers-too-big-to-jail-20130214#ixzz3Kgd0XJHO)\n\n> In April 2003, with 9/11 still fresh in the minds of American regulators, the Federal Reserve sent HSBC\'s American subsidiary a cease-and-desist\xc2\xad letter, ordering it to clean up its act and make a better effort to keep criminals and terrorists from opening accounts at its bank. One of the bank\'s bigger customers, for instance, was Saudi Arabia\'s Al Rajhi bank, which had been linked by the CIA and other government agencies to terrorism. According to a document cited in a Senate report, one of the bank\'s founders, Sulaiman bin Abdul Aziz Al Rajhi, was among 20 early financiers of Al Qaeda, a member of what Osama bin Laden himself apparently called the "Golden Chain." In 2003, the CIA wrote a confidential report about the bank, describing Al Rajhi as a "conduit for extremist finance." In the report, details of which leaked to the public by 2007, the agency noted that Sulaiman Al Rajhi consciously worked to help Islamic "charities" hide their true nature, ordering the bank\'s board to "explore financial instruments that would allow the bank\'s charitable contributions to avoid official Saudi scrutiny." (The bank has denied any role in financing extremists.)\n\n> In January 2005, while under the cloud of its first double-secret\xc2\xad-probation agreement with the U.S., HSBC decided to partially sever ties with Al Rajhi. Note the word "partially": The decision\xc2\xad would only apply to Al Rajhi banking and not to its related trading company, a distinction that tickled executives inside the bank. In March 2005, Alan Ketley, a compliance officer for HSBC\'s American subsidiary, HBUS, gleefully told Paul Plesser, head of his bank\'s Global Foreign Exchange Department, that it was cool to do business with Al Rajhi Trading. "Looks like you\'re fine to continue dealing with Al Rajhi," he wrote. "You\'d better be making lots of money!"\n\n> But this backdoor arrangement with bin Laden\'s suspected "Golden Chain" banker wasn\'t direct enough \xe2\x80\x93 many HSBC executives wanted the whole shebang restored. In a remarkable e-mail sent in May 2005, Christopher Lok, HSBC\'s head of global bank notes, asked a colleague if they could maybe go back to fully doing business with Al Rajhi as soon as one of America\'s primary banking regulators, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, lifted the 2003 cease-and-desist order: "After the OCC closeout and that chapter is hopefully finished, could we revisit Al Rajhi again? London compliance has taken a more lenient view."\n\n> After being slapped with the order in 2003, HSBC began blowing off its requirements both in letter and in spirit \xe2\x80\x93 and on a mass scale, too. Instead of punishing the bank, though, the government\'s response was to send it more angry letters. Typically, those came in the form of so-called "MRA" (Matters Requiring Attention) letters sent by the OCC. Most of these touched upon the same theme, i.e., HSBC failing to do due diligence on the shady characters who might be depositing money in its accounts or using its branches to wire money. HSBC racked up these "You\'re Still Screwing Up and We Know It" orders by the dozen, and in just one brief stretch between 2005 and 2006, it received 30 different formal warnings.': 1, 'Thanks, fixed :)': 2, "> The French regulator put huge pressure on him to close all businesses related to Bitcoin, even if there is nothing illegal in it.\n\nDon't forget that the current French Minister of Economy is a former bankster in the big bank cartel Rothschild ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmanuel_Macron ) ": 0, "This thread has been linked to from elsewhere on reddit.\n\n\n - [/r/bestof] [/u/murzika gives a compelling argument about why we need decentralization.](http://np.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/2nzgd5/umurzika_gives_a_compelling_argument_about_why_we/)\n\n\n*^If ^you ^follow ^any ^of ^the ^above ^links, ^respect ^the ^rules ^of ^reddit ^and ^don't ^vote ^or ^comment. ^Questions? ^Abuse?

Operators of Ponzi schemes usually entice new investors by offering higher returns than other investments, in the form of short-term returns that are either abnormally high or unusually consistent.\n\nThe difference is there is a central operator pulling the strings for their own benefit in a Ponzi. Bitcoin has no central operator that can manipulate the books to suit their purposes, or to keep it afloat, or to steal/reassign money to themselves with no-one the wiser. The Bitcoin network is never dishonest and never tries to protect old coins from losing value compared to new coins, and vice versa. Old addresses with coins aren't readjusted so that 100 USD worth of Bitcoin bought 4 years ago is worth 100 USD now to make new users feel like they aren't being treated unfairly.\n\nBy this characteristic, Bitcoin simply can't be classified as a Ponzi, and is much closer in nature to a precious metal or commodity than a stock (fraudulent or not), or even a currency in some respects.\n\n\n": 7}, ('Is Apple Pay A Bitcoin Killer?', 0): {"Let's see, do I want a device-specific system, that places another middleman between the buyer and merchant, by taking a photo of a credit card, encrypting it, then decrypting it internally, by tokenizing the transaction (OK so far) but then de-tokenizing it on the back end (oops, you were digital now you're not), leveraging a very high-cost network that was designed decades ago and is subject to massive fraud.

Bear in mind that when you are discussing things of technical nature with others, that its best to not assume that you are all-knowing in your godlike abilities, and instead to open yourself up to understanding so that you can perceive the situation better.\n\nNow, considering that you clearly lack knowledge on the topic, I can only try to explain your gaps of knowledge.\n\nYou seem to not understand what "securing" the network means. If the network is secure, then it will be secure against 51% attacks where a controller of the majority of the hashing power can gain a majority consensus to (possibly) do malicious acts. With bitcoin, that means theft of btc. Like...ALL of it. Complete control over the network (for that block)\n\nIn your scenario, there is "a device and that device automatically going to confirm transactions". Except you are being shortsighted, or perhaps purposefully naive, ignoring both the complexity, and the vast expanse of further inner workings of the process.\n\nYes, that machine \'confirms transactions\', just like my mining rig does. But, if there are only 10 of me supporting the network, then it will only take 11 other people running miners to 51% attack \'the network\' and to wreak havoc, destroying the validity of transactions, thereby rendering system obsolete/useless.\n\nThere are 100\'s of millions of dollars spent on *currently operating* mining rigs. The only reason that money was spent was because each person who bought those miners saw a return on the investment (*incentive*), and saw a possibility to make profit. Otherwise, those mining rigs would not be bought, and they would not be running, which would therefore leave a network without any hashing power, and vurnerable to 51% attacks.\n\nIn your naive scenario, you think IBM can just \'run a computer\' to do transactions, but in order to *secure the network* IBM is going to need to invest *hundreds of millions of dollars* to secure their network, when they could have instead just leveraged the bitcoin blockchain with its current anti-attackable hashpowered network.\n\nConsidering the above information, I *obviously DO have a idea what im \'rambling about\'*. As for "knowing better than IBM", I do not know the full scope of their plans, but in light of what information has been made public its very speculative (read: not knowable) as to HOW they are going to prevent their system from being attacked.\n\nConsidering that you have a very limited knowledge on the subject, I advise you start reading what people are typing, and stop writing insults on the internet.

You can maintain the decentralized network, linking banks and users worldwide just as Bitcoin does with no need for centralized technical infrastructure, introducing centralization only through the management of a trusted root key.  You can see my thoughts on how that would look [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/2jpj6z/founders_of_paypal_linkedin_and_yelp_discuss/cle2y1p).  The only difference would be that private keys would need to be generated by the US Gov after a registration process, either for all users of the system or only for the banks that process blocks (miners).\n\n\nNote that this is not a system I am endorsing in any way.  Just a devil's advocate thought experiment on potential competitors to Bitcoin from the legacy system using the same technology while maintaining many of the desirable decentralization advantages (and introducing only what many see as favorable centralization, letting the US gov manage and police the overall network while enforcing accountability for any malicious mining actions).  \n\n\nPegging to the USD by the fed or another bank (willing to buy/sell 1 USDcoin for 1USD at any time) would then take care of volatility as well for American customers, the #1 complaint with using BTC, while bringing the dollar closer to the de facto world currency, something the US government has fought very hard to do in the past and will likely continue fighting for.

I'm talking the entirety of the blockchain.\n\nAnd then beyond that, you and me will have tiny pieces of the blockchain. A big part of this has to do with pruning.\n\nBasically, if I have a dollar and I give it to you 10 times, and you give a dollar to me 5 times, we could say that I gave you 5 dollars. We now know you have 5 dollars and I have 5 dollars where before I had 10 dollars and you had no dollars. That's 20 transactions worth of useless data, which can be consolidated into one 'final state'. Each of those individual transactions used to be useful data, but old transactions become unimportant like that over time as a way to calculate who owns how much. We could easily take those 20 transactions and replace them with 1 transaction saying I gave you 5 dollars. We lose our history (of course any individual can simply store their own financial payment logs, I'm talking about collective history here) yet we do not lose track of who has how many bitcoins. It's technically a bit more complex due to transactions being chained inputs, but it essentially means that for security, we don't need to keep 100% of the blockchain. We'll save 100% of the blockchain for posterity (say for the interest of research universities) but it's not necessary in practice.\n\nIt's a bit like asking who owned the dollar in your pocket 15 years ago. It doesn't matter, as long as at one point each transaction that took that dollar closer to your pocket was verified, you can ignore all those old transactions.\n\nLastly, blockchain data growing isn't the biggest problem in the world. Our networks, storage and CPU transistor density all grow at roughly 50% per year. Now obviously our population growth or daily payments-per-capita won't grow indefinitely at anywhere near 50%, so I think we have a very good chance of seeing our technology keep pace with the increase in requirements (e.g. storage) of the bitcoin network.\n\n**In short**, we'll see enthusiast individuals, businesses, banks and universities keep full blockchains for posterity, research and completeness. We'll see ordinary folks keep 'lightweight' chunks of the blockchain. The blockchain will grow, but so will out ability to store, transmit and process larger amounts of data at lower costs. \n\nAnd finally, we may see decentralized autonomous organisations provide software as a service blockchain hosting some day, enabled by bitcoin of course.\n\n\n\n": 1, 'Embedding full nodes in everyday things, I imagine.

The proposed solution is to delegate this cost to an authority which will do this for you, while you only do the work/mining as you usually would.\n\nThis isn\'t really a satisfactory answer I\'d say. Not at all, actually. Imagine a large mining pool (say, 20% of the network) subscribes to some authority which manages which side-chains are being merge-mined. This authority effectively has a massive amount of hashing power at its disposal with which it may "secure" sidechains. Now let\'s say a new sidechain pops up, it\'s got some new mind-blowing features and it\'s ready to be tested in the wild, except since it\'s new and there are no clear economical benefits yet, merge mining for this thing is really no use (yet). So nobody\'s doing it. It\'s a chick-and-egg situation.\n\nSo then this 20% authority comes round the corner and starts merge mining it for whatever benevolent reasons they can come up with, and now this new and fancy side-chain is "20% as secure as bitcoin", except that\'s total bullshit because all of the mining power is controlled by a single authority which is just using work of an actual bitcoin mining pool that doesn\'t care (nor does it have to) about anything except the main chain. So this is not secure, saying side-chains are backed by the bitcoin security model if these kind of situations remain possible is just plain wrong.\n\n---\n\nEven worse, let\'s say the main chain is (rough example) secured by 3 pools (30%/30%/40%), then side-chain X is secured by pool #2 and #3. X gets 30%+40% == 70% of the main chain hasing power to secure itself, except pool #3 clearly is in control of the majority of the work being done on this chain (57%): not secure. In other words, merged mining a chain with any amount less than the main chain makes that chain magnitudes less secure.\n\n---\n\nSo I guess my question is: How can side-chains be considered secure if their security comes from merged mining?': 9, 'In bitcoin there is only one thing.
