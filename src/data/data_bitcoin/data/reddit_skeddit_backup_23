I'm pretty sure I originated this idea, I don't know how he heard about it, and I was wrong. \n\nI noticed the existence of the hashcash/Bitcoin PoW (they are actually slightly different [1] from each other) in the 2000 Aura paper when I was preparing the research for a paper I wrote many years ago called CommitCoin, which is about time-stamping on Bitcoin. \n\nI told a few people about it -- that the 2000 Aura paper had the idea (not merely using a PoW to deal with spam, but the exact PoW of using a nonce to produce a hash image with a certain number of leading zeros, which is very different from the PoW in either the Dwork/Naor paper or the Juels et al one). I noted this paper pre-dated the hashcash paper which was 2002. \n\nThe problem, which is in the very first sentence of the hashcash paper, is that while the paper was written in 2002, it was describing a protocol that went back 5 years. Later I confirmed that while the protocol varied somewhat over the years (and there were a few variants --- interactive and non-interactive), that idea was definitely there before the 2000 paper. There is another earlier 1998 paper that has effectively the same PoW as well [2] (in fact, this one is formulated as it is used in Bitcoin and not as in Hashcash).\n\nNow how CSW came to learn all this I'm not sure. It is possible he independently discovered the same thing, but I feel this is unlikely. Perhaps someone I told mentioned it on IRC or elsewhere where CSW saw it.

The US financial system is very fragile, due in part to weird non-free-market guarantees by the federal government. For example, banks in Puerto Rico are (I think) FDIC-insured. Because many banks in Puerto Rico probably own Puerto Rico bonds, many banks could go bankrupt due to this default, and the FDIC will have to pay their depositors. If many states were to default at once, the FDIC (which doesn\'t *really* operate using actuarial data as a real insurance company would) could be at risk of going bankrupt. If that happens, because the FDIC is backed by the full faith and credit of the US, the US will have to borrow (which usually means "print") tons of USD in order to cover the expenses. This in turn could lead to hyperinflation, which would cause massive worldwide economic issues. (I consider hyperinflation far more likely than any sort of bail-in scenario in the US.)': 13, '> so investors in their bonds should have known that this was likely.\n\nI have a feeling a lot of investment funds were buying PR bonds anyway, attracted to the relatively high interest rates in this new era of negative rates.\n\nProbably expecting little actual risk since the federal government would bail them out if it came to it.': 1, "I'm guessing they'll be some type of last minute emergency funding.
