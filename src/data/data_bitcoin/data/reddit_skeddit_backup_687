': 1, "That's not the point. The point is that if you have a dollar and it's supposed to mean something, i.e. it's a token of value in return for your service, it shouldn't be possible for someone to just print those tokens without any service in return.\n\nThat is, if I paint your house, you have to pay me. But you may not have something I want, or I may want something that is valued at 0.1 houses painted, or at 50 houses painted. How can we still trade? Well we come up with a value token. I pay your house and you give me 100 tokens of value, call them dollars. But these tokens are useless, they're nothing, except a way to turn them back into something with a similar value. You want to be able to turn those 100 tokens into a painted house, or something of similar value, years later. After all, that's what you did. With technology over time however we expect the service of painting to become easier, faster, more efficient, cheaper. And thus we expect the 100 value tokens to become worth MORE, i.e. it may paint 1.2 houses 10 years later due to technological changes.\n\nBut then some third party steps in, who didn't paint anyone's house, nor did they pay tokens (which they earned for another service) for having their house painted. This party is the government and they print 500 billion of these tokens. The common man who is NOT invested in the SP500 YET works for their actual value tokens loses their purchasing power, while others who ARE invested in the SP500 and who print money see their investments skyrocket. With the consequence that someone who received payment for painting a house couldn't get the market to give him back a lick of paint decades later. You can question that system. \n\nMeanwhile, there are tons of countries that have shown similar levels of inflation, yet never saw stock markets rise, and ultimately ended up with bankruptcy, hyperinflation and change of currencies, losing people all their money. i.e. money supply doesn't inherently mean lots of increased wealth in the stock market, so one can't inherently say inflating away 99% of a currency's value is completely fine when in many countries nobody benefited from it. It always works out until it doesn't.\n\nNow I've studied business & economics at several universities and I appreciate how important money supply is for economic growth and all that. I'm fully willing to say that there are a lot of positive caveats to the story of inflation that I'm not mentioning here, so I'm not implying here that FDIC is the worst thing ever and bail-outs are the worst thing ever and money supply is the worst thing ever. \n\nI'm simply stating that ThePenUltimateOne said FDIC is paid in taxes, they're not, they're paid by banks. And that he is confusing it with bail-outs, that are paid in taxes and through the money supply, neither of which are free of adverse affects.  That wasn't me stating it's therefore inherently bad, just stating fact. i.e. it's a tradeoff, and that the statement 'FDIC protection is free' like BeardMilk said, or the notion that financial systems are healthy because bail-outs provide a safety net, is too myopic for my tastes, so I provided the other side of the coin.": 1, "I don't even know where you can get service as bad as he mentioned.

Bitcoin was created so we\'d have a form of money without someone having infinite money.\n\nAlso, the theory is that without a constantly increasing supply, the value of Bitcoin should tend to increase, not decrease.\n\nAside from that, Bitcoin is fairly competitive with your country\'s currency\'s technology.  You can use Bitcoin online, and (unlike your country\'s currency), you can send it to anyone at a low fee without restriction.\n\nThe only problems, IMO, that Bitcoin has technologically is that:\n\n- Secure transactions take at least 5 minutes, so it really shouldn\'t be used in a store. (a few newer coins can achieve the same security in 5 seconds because of an algorithm [GHOST] invented by some Israeli scientists, but there\'s been no talk of implementing this in Bitcoin yet).\n\n- Transactions cost about $0.05, so you can\'t buy anything smaller than a pack of gum or so.  There has been some research into algorithms (PoS) that could lower this, but no one, as far as I know, has found a solution proven to work.\n\n- Not anonymous.

American Express would even mail you your card statement in dollars so you could pay in dollars instead of pesos if you preferred. The Mexican government has very strictly forbidden the use of US dollars now, mainly because that\'s the currency used by the drug cartels. So moving dollars in Mexico has become extremely difficult. When you go to exchange houses or banks to exchange currency you now get IDed and copies of your IDs are stored for every transaction you make. You will get audited if the government feels you\'re exchanging to many dollars to pesos. \n\nI have a feeling that once the Mexican government figures out how BBV\'s services can be used to "exchange" money they will start regulating it very strictly or even have BBV stopping "dinero movil" service until some transparency can be established with the service.

It is marked as device only, so it's not backed up to iCloud or in the iCloud keychain. It's only accessible by the Breadwallet app, no other apps can access it.\n\nSince it's in the keychain, if you delete the app and then install it again, the seed will still be there. \n\nDecryption is done by the Secure Element, a cryptographic chip that resides inside Apple's processors. \n\nGenerally this is pretty safe. There are some caveats though. Other apps can't access it, but that's due to Apple's software stack, not something that's enforced by hardware. There's always a chance that a malicious app finds a way to access the encrypted seed anyway, but it's still encrypted at that point.\n\nWhen the seed is decrypted, it resides in memory. Apps run in protected memory spaces, which should mean it's walled off from other apps. This is partially enforced by hardware, but there's always the possibility that some software finds a way around this.\n\nOverall I still think this is the best security you can get on an iPhone or any mobile device for that matter. \n\nAgain, I could be wrong about some things above, but I think the general gist of it is correct. If anybody knows more about this, please correct me.\n\nEdit: One thing that could be done (and maybe this already happens, or is / isn't possible) is a cryptographic critical section. That basically means that the entire system freezes, nothing executes except for the critical code section in the app that's dealing with sensitive information. The idea is basically that a critical section is started, the app then decrypts the seed, does all it has to do with it (sign transactions, messages, etc) and then wipes the sensitive information from memory before leaving the critical section. This makes it practically impossible for malicious apps to steal the decrypted keys but it relies on two things: whether or not critical sections actually exist in Apples chips / OS (I don't know, I haven't had the time to find out) and the wallet developer implements it properly (doesn't forget to wipe all sensitive info).\n\n\nApple security guide: https://www.apple.com/privacy/docs/iOS_Security_Guide_Oct_2014.pdf\n": 10, 'The Bitcoin tip for 100 bits has been collected by *riplin*.\n\n\n[ChangeTip info](https://www.changetip.com/tip-online/reddit) | [ChangeTip video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AnfKpypMNw) | /r/Bitcoin': 1, 'you could consult the author directly: /u/aaronvoisine': 1, "No, it's encrypted with a key inside the secure element.

One of the Arab spring countries. I have lived through curfews and have seen the outcomes of the sort of surveillance now being revealed in the US. People here talking about curfews aren\'t realizing what that actually FEELS like. It isn\'t about having to go inside, and the practicality of that. It\'s about creating the feeling that everyone, everything is watching. A few points:\n>\n> 1) the purpose of this surveillance from the governments point of view is to control enemies of the state. Not terrorists. People who are coalescing around ideas that would destabilize the status quo. These could be religious ideas. These could be groups like anon who are too good with tech for the governments liking. It makes it very easy to know who these people are. It also makes it very simple to control these people.\n>\n> Lets say you are a college student and you get in with some people who want to stop farming practices that hurt animals. So you make a plan and go to protest these practices. You get there, and wow, the protest is huge. You never expected this, you were just goofing off. Well now everyone who was there is suspect. Even though you technically had the right to protest, you\'re now considered a dangerous person.\n>\n> With this tech in place, the government doesn\'t have to put you in jail. They can do something more sinister. They can just email you a sexy picture you took with a girlfriend. Or they can email you a note saying that they can prove your dad is cheating on his taxes. Or they can threaten to get your dad fired. All you have to do, the email says, is help them catch your friends in the group. You have to report back every week, or you dad might lose his job. So you do. You turn in your friends and even though they try to keep meetings off grid, you\'re reporting on them to protect your dad.\n>\n> 2) Let\'s say number one goes on. The country is a weird place now. Really weird. Pretty soon, a movement springs up like occupy, except its bigger this time. People are really serious, and they are saying they want a government without this power. I guess people are realizing that it is a serious deal. You see on the news that tear gas was fired. Your friend calls you, frantic. They\'re shooting people. Oh my god. you never signed up for this. You say, fuck it. My dad might lose his job but I won\'t be responsible for anyone dying. That\'s going too far. You refuse to report anymore. You just stop going to meetings. You stay at home, and try not to watch the news. Three days later, police come to your door and arrest you. They confiscate your computer and phones, and they beat you up a bit. No one can help you so they all just sit quietly. They know if they say anything they\'re next. This happened in the country I live in. It is not a joke.\n>\n> 3) Its hard to say how long you were in there. What you saw was horrible. Most of the time, you only heard screams. People begging to be killed. Noises you\'ve never heard before. You, you were lucky. You got kicked every day when they threw your moldy food at you, but no one shocked you. No one used sexual violence on you, at least that you remember. There were some times they gave you pills, and you can\'t say for sure what happened then. To be honest, sometimes the pills were the best part of your day, because at least then you didn\'t feel anything. You have scars on you from the way you were treated. You learn in prison that torture is now common. But everyone who uploads videos or pictures of this torture is labeled a leaker. Its considered a threat to national security. Pretty soon, a cut you got on your leg is looking really bad. You think it\'s infected. There were no doctors in prison, and it was so overcrowded, who knows what got in the cut. You go to the doctor, but he refuses to see you. He knows if he does the government can see the records that he treated you. Even you calling his office prompts a visit from the local police.\n>\n> You decide to go home and see your parents. Maybe they can help. This leg is getting really bad. You get to their house. They aren\'t home. You can\'t reach them no matter how hard you try. A neighbor pulls you aside, and he quickly tells you they were arrested three weeks ago and haven\'t been seen since. You vaguely remember mentioning to them on the phone you were going to that protest. Even your little brother isn\'t there.\n>\n> 4) Is this even really happening? You look at the news. Sports scores. Celebrity news. It\'s like nothing is wrong. What the hell is going on? A stranger smirks at you reading the paper. You lose it. You shout at him "fuck you dude what are you laughing at can\'t you see I\'ve got a fucking wound on my leg?"\n>\n> "Sorry," he says. "I just didn\'t know anyone read the news anymore." There haven\'t been any real journalists for months. They\'re all in jail.\n>\n> Everyone walking around is scared. They can\'t talk to anyone else because they don\'t know who is reporting for the government. Hell, at one time YOU were reporting for the government. Maybe they just want their kid to get through school. Maybe they want to keep their job. Maybe they\'re sick and want to be able to visit the doctor. It\'s always a simple reason. Good people always do bad things for simple reasons.\n>\n> You want to protest. You want your family back. You need help for your leg. This is way beyond anything you ever wanted. It started because you just wanted to see fair treatment in farms. Now you\'re basically considered a terrorist, and everyone around you might be reporting on you. You definitely can\'t use a phone or email. You can\'t get a job. You can\'t even trust people face to face anymore. On every corner, there are people with guns. They are as scared as you are. They just don\'t want to lose their jobs. They don\'t want to be labeled as traitors.\n>\n> This all happened in the country where I live.\n>\n> You want to know why revolutions happen? Because little by little by little things get worse and worse. But this thing that is happening now is big. This is the key ingredient. This allows them to know everything they need to know to accomplish the above. The fact that they are doing it is proof that they are the sort of people who might use it in the way I described. In the country I live in, they also claimed it was for the safety of the people. Same in Soviet Russia. Same in East Germany. In fact, that is always the excuse that is used to surveil everyone. But it has never ONCE proven to be the reality.\n>\n> Maybe Obama won\'t do it. Maybe the next guy won\'t, or the one after him. Maybe this story isn\'t about you. Maybe it happens 10 or 20 years from now, when a big war is happening, or after another big attack. Maybe it\'s about your daughter or your son. We just don\'t know yet. But what we do know is that right now, in this moment we have a choice. Are we okay with this, or not? Do we want this power to exist, or not?\n>\n> You know for me, the reason I\'m upset is that I grew up in school saying the pledge of allegiance. I was taught that the United States meant "liberty and justice for all." You get older, you learn that in this country we define that phrase based on the constitution. That\'s what tells us what liberty is and what justice is. Well, the government just violated that ideal. So if they aren\'t standing for liberty and justice anymore, what are they standing for? Safety?\n>\n> Ask yourself a question. In the story I told above, does anyone sound safe?\n>\n> I didn\'t make anything up. These things happened to people I know. We used to think it couldn\'t happen in America. But guess what? It\'s starting to happen.\n>\n> I actually get really upset when people say "I don\'t have anything to hide. Let them read everything." People saying that have no idea what they are bringing down on their own heads. They are naive, and we need to listen to people in other countries who are clearly telling us that this is a horrible horrible sign and it is time to stand up and say no.': 2, "Oh, it provides accountability alright.

Intelligent responses all around, which has prompted me to make a comment of my own.\n\nI see a lot of arguments explaining the demand side of deflation, i.e., how consumers act when faced with a deflationary environment. But I haven't really seen anything explaining the supply side of the argument, of which, I think would bring more clarity to this discussion of whether deflation is bad or not.\n\nI fall in the camp that believes deflation IS bad. An example: \n\nDeflation erodes the value of assets, therefore, holding cash is your best strategy during a deflationary period. However, imagine now that you own a house, car, investment portfolio (think retirement), etc... Deflation will always be creating downward pressure of the price and value of these goods. Sounds good for consumers, as your all noting, but it's terrible for businesses. \n\nImagine opening a retail business and purchasing an inventory knowing very well that tomorrow and every day after you purchase that inventory the value of the goods you purchased will be decreasing. This is where a deflationary spiral begins, because, if your goods are selling for less and less in the future, you can't afford as many workers (higher unemployment) and/or you have to charge a premium for your product in hopes to recoup your initial investment before deflation renders your inventory worthless. Businesses would be constantly racing against deflation.\n\nTL DR; my point is, in a deflationary environment, holding assets is a losing strategy. Who would want to do business in this environment?\n": 1, 'Yes, but why?

': 0, '>inflation saps wealth from the people who hold the money\n\nThe counterpoint being that the wealthy don\'t hold most of their net worth as cash (they apportion it among assets which yield returns) while the impoverished unfortunately lack the opportunity/luxury of doing so.\n\nMeanwhile, in a deflationary environment, even though wealth discrepancy *is* exacerbated (and the rich do get richer), the poor should theoretically also get richer as long as they can stash a small portion of their earnings as basic savings. In other words, the primary difference is that poor people would not need to expend time and effort evaluating investment opportunities to benefit from macro-level economic growth and prosperity. They would by default hold a sort of "generic worldwide index fund" in the form of their money itself.\n\n>and lessens the debt burden of the people who carry the loan as the currency units they owe are worth less each year.\n\nSavvy creditors take this into account, though, and stipulate the terms of the loans they make accordingly. It\'s not like a debtor has a secret "ace up their sleeve" with the ongoing inflationary reduction of real debt; in most cases it is factored in when the loan is made. Accordingly, no actual benefits to the poor should result from this process.\n\n>In an ideal economy, you could take out your loans in an inflationary currency and invest your wealth in a deflationary one. \n\nThis is an interesting thought experiment. I don\'t think the "ideal economy" you describe is in stable equilibrium, because no creditors should rationally want to be paid back in the inflationary currency, if given the option and all else is equal. Demand for the deflationary currency (again, *ceteris paribus*) should ultimately dwarf that for the inflationary one, and eventually this effect should compound until one of the monies basically dies... \n\nI hesitate to say this would be an example of Gresham\'s Law playing out, but it would be something along similar lines.': 2, 'I didn\'t say it was bad, I said it was bad for certain things.

The protocol that gives rise to these digital currencies- the bitcoin protocol (small b)- could easily implement a different supply model.**\n\nSatoshi Nakamoto, 2009:\n>To Sepp's question, indeed there is nobody to act as central bank or federal reserve to adjust the money supply as the population of users grows. That would have required a trusted party to determine the value, because I don't know a way for software to know the real world value of things. If there was some clever way, or if we wanted to trust someone to actively manage the money supply to peg it to something, the rules could have been programmed for that.\nIn this sense, it's more typical of a precious metal. Instead of the supply changing to keep the value the same, the supply is predetermined and the value changes. As the number of users grows, the value per coin increases. It has the potential for a positive feedback loop; as users increase, the value goes up, which could attract more users to take advantage of the increasing value.\n\nThe question of whether he would have done it differently if he could is interesting but *mostly* academic. It has been discussed (e.g. by Buterin but also many others) that you could have supply sensitive to the transaction volume. I do not think it would be desirable, personally. It is another potential source of system instability. I believe Satoshi chose the precious metal/ commodity money model because it fit with what he was building and it would have been architecturally an ugly stretch to try to do it a different way. I also believe he generally *preferred* that model of money, because of the earlier quote from the same place:\n\n>The root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that's required to make it work. **The central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust. Banks must be trusted to hold our money and transfer it electronically, but they lend it out in waves of credit bubbles with barely a fraction in reserve**. \n\nEdit: I've slightly misrepresented/oversimplified in my paragraph above. Of course any kind of supply schedule, including an infinite supply, would have been possible as long as it was predictable or deduced from the internal system state (varying with transaction volume being the most obvious one but perhaps other internal state measurements are interesting like 'days destroyed'). What's impossible is varying supply according to external factors like prices of real world goods and services, without having some trust in the system at the point where that data gets fed in.\nSo the choice of a *finite* supply was very much Satoshi's choice. But his choice to not respond to the price of goods is not really a choice - that was never going to be possible in a trustless system.\n\n": 2, 'You believe science to be based on popularity?\n\n': 1, "No, it's not just Keynesians.

Firstly, the amount you owe effectively increases every year as each of the currency units you owe become more valuable. Secondly, you would still have interest rates punishing you on top of the money you are losing due to inflation, these would act together in a compound manner. Thirdly, all else being equal, your wages would decrease each year as the currency becomes more valuable, so you would have less currency units per year to pay off your debt.\n\nHome loans are the biggest expenditure middle class families will face, but the effect would be the same on all big purchases where credit is needed (Vehicles, Student Loans, etc.)\n\nThe other side of this is that inflation is good for people who carry debt. If you have a home loan at 4% interest, and the inflation rate for the year is 4%, then effectively its a "free" loan. Giving the middle class access to cheap credit like that spurs the economy.

IOU notes should have slightly negative real interest rate, which means: if I give you IOU the longer you hold it, the less you\'re getting from it. Creditors are free to trade and exchange different IOU, which settles their value on the market. So Coca-Cola trades "CO IOUs" which are backed by bottles of Coke.\n\nPeople would be borrowing and investing using IOUs, while saving in sound money. Hoarding money is preferable as it\'s harder to get hold of and noone will borrow you any, but getting IOUs is easier: if you work for Coca Cola, you will get paid (at least partially) in CO IOUs, and so you need to spend them somehow. As a merchant you want to accept them because people are willing to spend them, and they are backed by real goods. The competing IOUs and their price denominated in sound money will be a market decision for credit availability and it\'s price.
