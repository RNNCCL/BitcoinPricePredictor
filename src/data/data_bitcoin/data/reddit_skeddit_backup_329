A block size fork in no way changes this fact.\n\nIn reality forks are happening all the time. Double spend attacks, orphaned blocks and recommended number of confirmations are all due to the chain forking for any number of reasons. Greedy miners can withhold a solved block, failure to propogate etc. Typically these forks only exist for a block or two. (Roughly 20 minutes) The reason the block size fork is actually mentioned is because it\'s likely that two chains will survive longer than 20 minutes so there\'s a higher risk of double spends. So, if your coins are in cold storage and you\'re not spending them there isn\'t anything for you to worry about. Like most people, I believe that one chain will die off "fairly quickly" as in a day or two.\n\nHowever, there is a small possibility that *both* chains will survive and that can make things more complicated. What that means is your cold storage keys could be used to spend your coins on either chain. So if you have 5 btc now and both chains survive you would have 5 coins of btc1 and 5 coins of btc2. At that point it\'s more of a question of economics what would happen. I\'m speculating here but given that it would effectively double the number of coins that people are attaching value to that would likely drive down the price of both coins. But, given that you have twice as many you\'d still have about the same purchasing power. Once things settle down I would expect people to begin selling off whichever coins they don\'t really want.

LN does not aim to replace bitcoin for payments.": 5, '>bitcoin becomes more expensive to use, but that would not destroy it as a store of value\n\nDo you know how much of the (relatively stable) value currently invested in bitcoin is long-term speculation that it\'ll take over large swaths of the economy? Let me give you a hint; _virtually all of it_. Everyone\'s betting that bitcoin will eventually be big. Give the impression that it\'ll remain small, and the whole thing collapses. Your "store of value" then becomes no better than any other speculation vehicle, including but not limited to gold and Picasso paintings. Heck, at least I can make jewelry out of gold, and the government actually needs to use guns and make a ruckus to take my gold.\n\nThe value-retention part of bitcoin is only as good as the utility side; you can\'t put the cart before the horse.': 4, "See [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3gmkak/the_blockstream_business_plan/) and [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3gmkak/the_blockstream_business_plan/ctzj25q) for some of the problems.\n\nThe Lightning network will not be like bitcoin at all.  For one thing, it will require trusted third parties that will be like Coinbase and Circle, only 100 to 10'000 times bigger, with AML, KYC, etc.  (Even it the design prevents them from stealing your money outright, they can block you from sending payments to anyone they don't like, can freeze your money for months, refuse to open an account, etc.  You will no longer be able to pay with on-chain transactions because the fees will be too high, and the person you want to pay will not want to be paid that way for the same reason.  And more...  ": -4, "> on-chain transaction to open a channel will be so high that you essentially don't have a choice but to devote funds to a channel for very long\n\nBlockstream devs have been talkig of 20-100 USD/tx fees for on-chain transactions, so that only high-value settlements are on the blockchain.\n\n> Everybody, especially LN devs (there is an interesting epicenter bitcoin episode with them) know that blocksize will hve to increase to prevent [high fees].\n\nBut what is the point then of letting the network get congested now, if it has to be de-congested latter?  What will be the point to make bitcoin unusable just to raise the fees to 1 $ or less?  \n\n> You will have to make an tradeoff between flexibility (short devotion times) and cheapness (long devotion times).\n\nNot quite.  in order to reduce the on-chain traffic to 1/100 of the LN traffic (or 1/100000, according to Adam) , it is neecessary that each payment channel be used for 100-200 LN transactions, *on average*.  So the active bitcoiner who makes 2 transactions per day must lock 3 months' worth of payments, on average. \n\nWhen you start looking a bit more closely at how the LN will function, you run into many unpleasant numbers like that \n\nIt follows that most LN users will have to open only one or two channels to hubs, and will be discouraged (presumably by tariffs) from making payments by any other path than through one or more hubs.  Merchants too will have  downstream channels from one or two hubs, and will not want to receive payments on the blockchain, or receive channels directly from customers or other minor hubs.  \n\nIt then follows that hubs will be large companies.  It follows that they will submit to all laws and regulations, including AML/KYC.
