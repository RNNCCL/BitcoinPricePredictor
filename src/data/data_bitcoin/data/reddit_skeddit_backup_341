Do blocks contain a history of where \n> bitcoins have been transfered to and from?\n\nBitcoins are sent to and from bitcoin addresses, which are essentially random numbers with no identifying information.\n\nWhen you send to an IP address, the transaction is still written to a bitcoin address.  The IP address is only used to connect to the recipient's computer to request a fresh bitcoin address, give the transaction directly to the recipient and get a confirmation. \n\nBlocks contain a history of the bitcoin addresses that a coin has been transferred to.  If the identities of the people using the bitcoin addresses are not known and each address is used only once, then this information only reveals that some unknown person transferred some amount to someone else.\n\nThe possibility to be anonymous or pseudonymous relies on you not revealing any identifying information about yourself in connection with the bitcoin addresses you use.  If you post your bitcoin address on the web, then you're associating that address and any transactions with it with the name you posted under.  If you posted under a handle that you haven't associated with your real identity, then you're still pseudonymous.\n": 2, "In theory you should ask for two addresses to send to\n\nIn practice this is too annoying so people don't do it.

And while it is still pretty safe to use, in the (insanely unlikely as it may be) event that the cryptography supporting Bitcoin breaks down, the first addresses to break and get stolen from will be the ones that have their EC public keys published to the blockchain.

I will use Visa as an example.\n\n* Transaction input phase (the time after you see Transaction OK when you swipe a card,  until when uncleared funds are posted to the merchant account - often 24 hours or more)\n* Back end settlement phase (the time from when Visa says you have funds, until they become clear funds with no risk of a charge back - 6+ months or so)\n\nFor the *Back end settlement phase* Bitcoin wins hands down - final settlement in about an hour, versus 6+ months.\n\nFor *Transaction input phase* VISA wins hands down. VISA *does not* **lose** *data* after you see that Transaction OK message (or Transaction accepted ...or whatever local message you get)\n\nSetting fees, offering hints on fee levels, supporting **R**eplace **B**y **F**ee are all band-aids that try to work around the basic issue of unreliability/data integrity of the Transaction input phase that Bitcoin currently has.\n\nThere is a reason that merchants happily let you walk out the door with your purchase as soon as they see the Transaction OK message on their terminal. \n\nThey are certain that the transaction will definitely make its way to the Back End settlement process .. at some vague point in the future, with possible charge backs... but **it will not be lost**\n\nThat lets VISA collect transactions fairly locally, and later push them to the Back End settlement system.\n\nPerformance wise, that means a technically easy Transaction Input system, that scales in a linear way,as much as they like.\n\nBitcoin co-mingles these two phases, as a historical design accident, but does not have to stay that way.\n\nI am planning to write up a proper design document about this, and I guess this concept will get attacked ... but I would rather address a design flaw than spend lots of effort on band-aid tactics.\n\nUltimately, I expect the system will end up a hybrid - with support for both unsafe TX input and safe Tx input .. since each approach supports different goals. (unsafe Tx approach is trustless, safe Tx needs trust in elements of the system that you do not control)\n\nJust to be clear, the current strategy of 0-conf data being sometimes lost, was not an issue when *every* Bitcoin user was doing all three things: Tx input, blockchain validation, mining.  That situation no longer exists.\n\n\nAt the start, (and now) a node doing all three functions was only trusting themselves and the Bitcoin protocol. Now, if you run an SPV wallet, you are trusting the nodes who are validating blocks, and the miners who are creating blocks. Not individual third party trust (like the banking system uses), but systemic trust at least - with the advantage that if you get suspicious you can always start validating or mining for yourself. The system remains permissionless, which is a substantial advantage, but unless you are doing all three functions, it is no longer totally peer-to-peer and trustless.\n\nEDIT\n\nThank you Mycelium for these changes ... in lieu of making Tx input *safe*, these changes are really helpful\n\nEDIT\n\nTry to use clearer words defining the Back end settlement phase": 2, 'So, is it better now?': 1, 'I love you guys.\n\nIf I may make request for an extra function in the app, I think it would be nice to be able to set an alarm for incoming and outgoing transaction after a certain amount of confirmations.': 13, 'My own server is a much smaller target.

The role of **Tx Store**, optional, like the Validation role and the Miner role ... but a separate concept. Not currently supported in Bitcoin Core, but an extra capability that would not detract from the other functions...\n\nWe could extend the API to have an attribute carried along with a Transaction during it's life in the network whilst it is 0-conf. The attribute gets dropped after the Tx gets added to a block in the block chain, so there is zero change to the mining or validation process.\n\nThat attribute would be to request data integrity - IE. Do not lose this transaction. Sort of like the rebroadcast option that Mycelium just added, but respected by any node that cares to provide that **Tx Store** role.\n\nThat would spread the responsibility for data integrity during the 0-conf period  to more than just the sender or receiver.  Anyone relying on this data integrity attribute, would be relying on a subset of the entire Bitcoin network - not just the other party in their transaction. That would make it almost certain that a Tx will eventually make it to the Back end settlement phase.\n\nIf you allow RBF as well (and why not), the receiving party can always negotiate with the sender to increase the fees, after the event, if they are not being paid as quickly as they would like... but they would remain assured of payment in the long run, even if the fee stays the same - which is better than VISA does with its charge backs.\n": 1, "Yes that's pretty much just what I was thinking, maybe it could even email a secondary account to alert them as well": 1, 'Thanks, trasla.': 2, 'Thank you for that awsome work.

Stay away from Ripple.\n\nSorry bout your bitcoins, not sure you'll get 'em back.": 2, 'Hold on. You say you traded XRP for "btc (in my RT account)". This doesn\'t show a solid grasp of how Ripple works.\n\nRipple is a credit network. XRP is the neutral native crypto currency of that network, but any other currency doesn\'t exist in Ripple in the abstract.\n\nDenominations of everything else in ripple is credit (debt), meaning at some point you implicitly or explicitly stated that you trusted a specific counter party to hold BTC on your behalf and then you executed a trade of XRP for BTC with that counter party.\n\nYou need to figure out who that counter party is, figure out what their particular redemption requirements are, and communicate with them. Don\'t assume a ripple to btc bridge as baked into the client/protocol is the only way out, your BTC counter party may allow you to create a pure ripple transaction to a specific address that as far as the ripple network is concerned ends their BTC debt to you, but as per that counter parties policies triggers them to make the BTC available to you through their own (outside of Ripple) platform.\n\nAt worst you can figure out who the BTC counter party is by probing the ripple protocol to get the ripple address of that counter party. Hopefully folks on ripple.com/forum and xrptalk.org can help you if need be.\n\nYou may not have to have to use the rippletrade.com client with all its restrictions. I\'m not up to date on the latest, but there were other folks putting up their own forked ripple clients. Ask the forums.\n\nThe Ripple network itself doesn\'t restrict which clients can connect and transact. It\'s the actual counter parties on Ripple who each set their own policy as to what sorts of KYC processes they want you to have gone through to do business with them. I believe Ripple Labs was also putting out a desktop client that was very different from the ripple trade client at one point.\n\nTo use another client, you\'ll need your underlying Ripple private key, don\'t expect the old fashioned username/password pair you use on Ripple Trade to work.\n\nSo the devil is in the details. Who are the counter parties with debts to you, what are their respective policies?\n\nIf you\'re looking for a fast track to avoid dealing with the counter parties, you may actually find quicker salvation if there is someone else who trades with your same BTC counter party and has a trade posted on the network for XRP!\n\nWhy would you want to trade back to XRP?! Because, as the native currency that is counter party free, and can be transmitted direct between accounts with the right client and private key to anyone on the network. This gives you much more flexibility.\n\nFor example, shapeshift.io is a website that will give you  a ripple address to send XRP to and they will send you BTC and the trade and BTC aspect is done entirely off the ripple network. Basically you\'re choosing to make them a counter party (recorded in their own system) for a few seconds while they validate receiving the XRP and then they send you BTC.\n\nAnother example, an old ripple site that isn\'t in to KYC is dividendrippler.com. They don\'t require a restricted ripple client. You could trade your XRP with BTC owing to you by Dividend Rippler and then use their withdrawl process. (heads up, it takes an accountless approach that takes some getting used to).\n\nI believe there are other alt coin places that do XRP trading as well. Do your homework.\n\nWherever you trade, look at the order book very carefully. If a particular market for trading XRP to BTC is very thin, you could end up with a lot of slippage and not get a good price for your XRP.\n\nTrader beware.': 2, 'Roger that...  Yikes.

Can I schedule payments with them? ": 1}, ('Master thesis', 6): {"Ahh.  Long one to explain.  Someone asks about this every 3 months or so, and to date it remains unanswered.  (I should say many have offered partial solutions, but most don't seem to understand the question fully to appropriately answer.)   Let me look up the time I asked about it:\n\n\nTo begin with, let's clear some facts.  Bitcoin's monetary supply is increasing, and is expected to increase for the next ~125 years.  However, I'll define bitcoin as deflationary (as most do) since the demand is currently at ~$1m/day, and has increased relative to other currencies since inception.  And in a world whereby everyone were to be using bitcoin, I think it's fair to say the price would be substantially more than its current price.\n\n\nSo to get to the point, people will always need to take loans, whether for buying a house, cars, a business, etc. But doing so in a deflationary currency (as I expect bitcoin to continue to behave) could prove to be particularly painful, especially over a long-term loan.  I, certainly, am much happier that my home mortgage is in fiat, instead of BTC.\n\n\nBut if large-scale loans, like mortgages, were denominated in bitcoin, what would that look like?\n\n\nTo remain competitive in this context, banks lending in BTC could lower their interest rates, effectively compensating for the deflation. And just as banks estimate the ROI of their loans relative to inflation, they could equally do so, relative to deflation. If deflation were to be particularly extreme, one might imagine a competitive bank offering a negative interest rate.  (Not unlike Switzerland or the ECB have done.)  But this is where this idea seems to break down. Would a consumer-facing bank ever have the incentive to offer a negative interest rate loan, when they could just keep the BTC instead for a higher growth rate? More broadly, can effective lending happen in a highly deflationary currency?\n\nThe whole concept of lending in a deflationary currency seems to break down at the point where the debtor's risk factor is sufficiently low, that their assigned interest rate is less than the rate of deflation.  Think about it or do the math.  And for what it's worth, Chris Larsen has said it's impossible.  Let's prove him wrong, if in fact, he is wrong.\n\n\nFor much of AD history, gold (typically though of as deflationary as well) has been a popular currency.  So I can\xe2\x80\x99t imagine that this issue has not been faced before.  But I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what the solutions were, or whether they\xe2\x80\x99re applicable to the degree of deflation, a worldwide Bitcoin currency could create.\n\nTL;DR example:  Why would a bank ever make a 5% loan in a 10% depreciating currency, when fractional reserve lending isn't an option?\n\n": 1, "Interesting, will read later!

They could have done this in Fall 2011 when the price was under $10, too, but didn't because it just wasn't well-known as a payment mechanism.

Probably not a lot of income, but there'd be some. It's probably worth exploring at least. Maybe they have already looked into it and determined it's just not worth it, too, I don't know.
