In practice, bitcoin has historically been more of a speculative asset that is sold for cash rather than exchanged directly for goods from vendors. Under these conditions, the extra spending power of "early investors" has come less from holders of fiat than from later or more unlucky investors. There has also been some redistribution of wealth to bitcoin sellers from the owners of whatever other stuff people would have bought if bitcoin wasn\'t around.\n\nIn the long-run, the bitcoin economy only escapes this zero-sum trap when the network becomes economically productive in its own right, and its existence supports activities which create greater value than the ones they supplant.

People psychologically *hate* taking a wage cut. Empirical examples of this are all in the past, so it isn\'t clear whether this effect would be mitigated when pricing becomes more fluid (electronic price tags, etc., with adjustments based on market conditions; this would be problematic with the $0.99 marketing), but it might take an evolution of how people think about wages & salaries.\n\nDespite this drawback, I think a slightly deflationary currency [i.e., only from lost coins] still has an incredible benefit.

If you have 21 million BTC for 6 billion people on Earth and then 10 years later there are 12 billion people the average person should be holding half of 10 years ago. I think inflation is necessary because of this. Think about all the big companies that hoard more and more money, it cuts circulation, and if happens too much the inequality would be even greater than it is now.\n\nWhile I understand why it\'s easy to think like this, the above reasoning does not work because it is oversimplified and does not stand up to real theoretical scrutiny. \n\nIn a healthy growing economy there is always going to be an opportunity cost to hoarding currency which can be re-invested into the economy, even in a deflationary macro-environment. For example, let\'s say that the real economy is growing at a nice 5%, but inflation is -2% (i.e., deflation of 2%). As a holder of the currency, I could certainly just leave my currency alone and let it appreciate by 2% annually. This is not a terrible rate of return, but on the other hand I could have invested my currency back into the general economy and earned an effective 7% return (the rate of deflation + real growth), so I have effectively lost 5% of my return as an opportunity cost for not re-investing my currency - i.e., I have become poorer relative to my peers who chose to invest in the economy. In general, people want to earn the best possible return on their existing wealth without taking on undue risk, so the "rational investor" in this scenario will almost certainly not horde their currency.\n\n"But," you say, "what if people are not rational and just horde currency anyway since the 2% return is risk free?" This is really not a big concern for the reasons explained above, but even if you think about what actually happens when many people start hording a currency, you see that everyone hording all of the time is just not possible. Suppose economic growth is 5% and inflation is -2% as above. Everyone holding currency decides, "I\'ll just horde what I have and wait for my wealth to appreciate!" What happens next? As money is taken out of the economy, initially you would see additional deflation to -3, -4 or even -5% inflation. This is what Keynesian economists refer to melodramatically as a "deflationary death spiral," but this is a misnomer since deflation cannot actually spiral out of control. Why? This "death spiral" is countered by a corresponding increase in interest rates as borrowers (companies, governments, etc.) have a harder time finding currency on the open market and thus are forced to increase the price they pay for borrowed currency. The more people hoard, the greater the above opportunity cost to not investing or loaning your currency out is. For example, let\'s say inflation goes from -2% to -5% as people hoard currency, while interest rates go from 5% to 10% as it becomes harder and harder to find currency on the open market. Now your opportunity cost for failing to invest is 15%!\n\nEventually this opportunity cost would just be too tempting for many investors and the economy would reach a natural deflation/inflation equilibrium determined by the market. Calculating this equilibrium is tricky, but you can be absolutely certain that it will be reached and people will not hoard their currency until there is none left on the open market. This theoretical perspective is also very well supported by the historical evidence: crippling long-term deflation has never been observed in a growing economy, even when the money supply is fixed or effectively fixed.\n\nTl;DR: The dogma of "inflation, bad!" is just that.': 7, 'deflation -> buy more stuff -> nice\n\ninflation -> buy less stuff -> not so nice\n': 2}, ('A Great Reason to Not Buy Bitcoin: $5 Million Stolen Without a Trace', 0): {"Those people didn't buy bitcoin.

That would be ridiculous.  Instead, you'd add a protocol (potentially on top of an existing cryptocurrency like Bitcoin) that basically says the following: we all agree that transactions with certain formatting, which destroy a certain quantity of the currency, will be taken to register a domain, and connect it to some arbitrary string of information, like a private key, URL, Bitcoin address, etc.  From there, we also allow certain other transactions, from the same private key, to transfer control of that domain to another wallet.  You'd probably want to add regular (small) maintenance dues to make mass domain squatting / permanent domain destruction impractical.  These special transactions are all preserved in the block chain.  Anyone can find them by just going through the chain and parsing them into a rapidly accessible data structure like a hash table.  \n\nFrom there, anyone running a full node can resolve their own domain name requests (or provide DNS services for users who can't practically maintain a full node (for example, mobile users)).  This would provide DNS services that are similarly fast to what we have today for lookups, and are generally decentralized and resilient to external attack, at the expense of having to store several gigabytes of data to access the web (and there are ways of reducing this expense, both for cryptocurrencies in general, and, more so, for this application in particular).\n   ": 7, 'Blockchain does not necessarily mean Bitcoin.

Gox. Yes, recourse is just as poor as Mt. Gox (when it's gone, it's gone). But that's just one element in risk.\n\nKeeping bitcoins secure is actually terribly easy. The problem is keeping it secure when you also run an hot-wallet on a server that allows automatic transactions whenever the server admin or an authenticated client makes a transaction request. That's hard because hackers can take over a server (indeed it could take a single phone call pretending to be the server admin, it sounds like a joke but it's happened countless times, even to a bitcoin company.) or hackers can steal authentication credentials from users. (happens all the time whether it's bitcoin, paypal or facebook). And there's no real way to catch each problem as the server has to be automated when you're doing lots of transactions.\n\nBut doing manual transactions is actually pretty easy. It's not completely trivial but with a bit of thought you can get it done quite easily. It'll involve multi-signature addresses, loaded onto a dedicated computer which has never been online and never will be, and only signs transactions. Signed transactions are relayed back through e.g. a QR code instead of USB so that you have one-way information only, and the only information passing through this channel is a signed transaction (not a key).\n\nYou do this with multiple such computers owned by multiple people in a secure location. Each must sign the transaction and be on the phone with each other while doing it. A code word like 'How's the weather?' would signal any of the signors to abort the transaction. \n\nNone of this is really a big deal. It involves about 1 daily manhour in total. Because of the way an ETF works (it settles once or twice a day, and all other transactions are essentially virtual inside their platform) you barely need any transactions at all, so it's easy to do them manually and do proper checks and accounting. And even then, it's likely only a small fraction of coins need to be traded in or out on a daily basis, meaning the vast majority of coins can be locked away under even stricter multi-sig requirements (e.g. 20 of 20 keys/people).\n\nThis is so secure that I expect it'll be quite easy for them to get insurance. And it's quite likely we'll see companies offer dedicated services to do exactly that, too. e.g. Xapo offers an insured wallet at 0.12%, Coinbase offers a free one, Circle, too. It's not unlikely we'll see them get insurance for this much less risky venture for less than 1%, too.": 1, 'Exactly...

The value of (what you can buy with) bitcoin changes according to both the amount in circulation **and** the demand for that real-estate on the blockchain (which is what bitcoin actually is).\n\nLet\'s say, hypothetically, that an entire closed economy operates using only bitcoin. And let\'s say there is an economic slow-down. What happens to the price of bitcoin, if no more currency is being created?\n\nPerhaps this is only conjecture, but I\'m pretty sure that the decrease in transaction volume (bitcoin changing hands) that would accompany an economic down-turn, will cause a devaluation of the bitcoin currency. In other words, the demand for real-estate on the blockchain  goes down along with a bitcoin economy that is sagging. (Think of the value of real-estate as a neighborhood goes into decline.)\n\nAs the value of bitcoin goes down, this has an inflationary effect which economists like, because it incentivizes people and businesses to spend, rather than save, which in turn stimulates economic growth.\n\nSeems to me the whole argument for deflation is being made by basing  predictions of the future on misguided (even if deductively deduced) assumptions from past data.

If your purchasing power goes up, I'm pretty sure you're more likely to spend, but as deflation generally only happens in times of economic hardship, I wonder if economists are confusing cause & effect in this case?": 2, "It's good, because the emphatic detractor clearly doesn't know what he's talking about; it's further evidence that there isn't much bad to say about Bitcoin.\n\nIt moves us backwards towards the problems of storing cash? *facepalm*": 1, 'I said "monetary inflated".
