I assume you use USD but what it trades for is somewhat irrelevant (not really but lets keep it simple).\n\nThink of it like your in a room with 19 other individuals.  10 of which are trying sell and the other 9 (+ yourself) are trying to buy.  Out of the 10 trying to sell maybe you have 2 or 3 each lowering the price on each other, 2 or 3 more are posting a price above the other 2 or 3 and not budging.  The remaining guys are selling at a much higher price.  \n\nYou as a buyer obviously want to buy from the first set of guys selling at the lowest price.  Usually these guys don\'t have much to sell.  The next set of 2 or 3 guys have a medium amount to sell at a higher amount and the last set of guys have a huge amount to sell.  \n\nDepending on how much you are looking to purchase you must pay "more" for each bitcoin.  This is not always the case as things will average out to a price per bitcoin over a large purchase.  \n\nTo complicate this you and the other 9 buyers "should" be trying to get the most bitcoin for the least amount of USD.  When they buyers are moving backwards the price goes down.  They may not accept any offer on the table and everyone has to lower there price.  The opposite is true when the buyers out bid each other.\n\nSellers and buyers have to meet somewhere and that is what you consider the value.  The spread is the difference between the highest buyers bid and the lowest sellers ask.\n\nThis is the 101 version and there are many many many games people play in these exchanges.  I would recommend reading up on markets and exchanges or learning (takes about a year but mileage will vary) with very low funds to start.  Until you know what a "bear trap" is you should hold off on playing big.': 3, 'The value you sell at should be higher than what you paid for them.

I find that very hard to believe. ': 6, "> The recent $GBTC offering has demonstrated a willingness by certain investors to pay a premium for bitcoins which provide them greater security, and ability to acquire a large amount without driving the market.\n\nToday'strade volume was only 327 BIT shares (~32.7 BTC), mostly at 49.00 $/share.  \n\nThe average BIT share was acquired by its holder for about 40--50 USD.   So it is not surprising that shareholders are not very eager to sell for less than that.  I suppose that they are still hoping for higher prices.  \n\nOn the other hand, people who do not have any shares, but might be interested in buying BTC through BIT, apparently think that 100% premium is too much.\n\nConsidering only the posted bids, if someone decided to sell 2000 shares (200 BTC; 0.15% of the market cap) at once, the price would drop to 20 $/share.": 4, 'Nice try, taxpayer': -1, 'Mass auctions typically attract a premium that benefits the buyer, not the seller in these cases. If someone wanted 44, 000 BTC at less than 200% premium, they could easily go to market and pick it up. Volume is 200, 000 [per day](https://blockchain.info/charts/estimated-transaction-volume). ': 1, "I don see why this would be better than a single auction with no minimal price.  Why would someone buy raw BTC for 2x the market price?  Buying 44'000 BTC on the exchanges, spaced out over a month, would hardly raise the price that much.\n\nIf the USMS did as you propose, quite likely there would be no bidders on the first round, so it would be wasted work for the USMS.  If there was a bidder willing to bid at 2x market in Round 1, he could also make that bid in a free auction and win anyway. \n\nThe USMS is not particularly interested in maximizing the revenue, nor helping bitcoin investors.  The goal of those auctions,in general, is to convert random seized property, that the government cannot use, into dollars, that the government can use forthe benefit of the people etc.  The primary concern of the staff workers who set up the auctions is to follow all the rules and not make any stupid mistake that could give them negative points on their resume.  Breaking up the auction must be understood that way.  If they had auctioned all 174'000 BTC at once, and the price crashed at the news, or they did not get enough bidders, or they were forced to sell way below market -- that would have been a stupid mistake.\n\nFinally, the USMS has its established bureaucratic routine and rules for doing auctions, including standard templates for announcements, bid forms, etc..  The routine can be modified to accomodate special features of the item, such as the way of delivering bitcoins; but having a two-round auction, with a high minimum price in the first round, would be going a long way off the beaten path.  Again, it is very unlikely that they would do that just to help itcoin investors.": 2, "Why?\n-Lack of flexibility or options in auction offering.\n-Doubt the premium would be paid.\n-Other?\n\nDemand has risen. The market has 'learned' that auction-offered coins will be bought.\nIf memory serves, one leaked auction revealed close-to (slightly below?) market prices, with the rest commanding a premium.\n\nThis is the last known large offering, save for the MtGox/Bitcoinica distribution coming through Kraken in September. At that point, their exchange will allow for leveraging long, so the question remains whether that distribution will have a net positive or negative effect.\n\nI think it is entirely possible to see the final round of coins go for such a premium.\nI don't consider it the most likely outcome, but it is certainly a possibility.": 1}, ("51% attacks aren't limited to Bitcoin...", 0): {"Don't click.

All transactors must transact through the UFUN portal.\n* UTokens are NOT a cryptocurrency. It is a digital currency. It is NOT innovative or revolutionary. It is simply a database.\n* UTokens are not limited in supply. No one knows how many there are in circulation. When someone \'invests\', they are simply given UTokens generated from a database entry.\n* You can\'t trade UTokens outside of the UFUN portal.\n* The company claims that the value CANNOT go down, but only up. Why is this? Very simply, because "demand is outstripping supply" and plus, the company sets the price, therefore UTokens are protected from market crashes (what logic...).\n* You can invest in an amount of UTokens today, and spend them at the stores or wait for appreciation. If you refer other investors, you can receive a percentage of their investment, and also a percentage on their referrals too.\n\nTo get an idea of what UTokens are, please watch the youtube videos listed above.

Having done so, if the next move *isn\'t* what your analysis predicted, then the waves can always be re-drawn to fit the new data; error is always the fault of the analyst, never the theory.\n\nI\'m reminded of the concept of "epicycles" - when astronomers believed that the other celestial bodies orbited the Earth, they observed apparent motions of those bodies across the sky that couldn\'t be explained by a simple circular orbit but *could* be explained by a series of nested orbits (e.g. planets tracing a circular path around a point, with that point following a circular orbit around the Earth). But it turns out that combining circles like that can produce *literally any* apparent motion you care to choose as a starting point - just add more circles until it fits what you observe.\n\nIn scientific terms, a theory is confirmed by subjecting it to tests that could disprove it, and watching as none of those tests succeed in doing so. But when nothing is ruled out, there\'s no outcome that would demonstrate that the theory was mistaken, no possible test and therefore no ability to confirm its predictive ability. My concern then is that waves function like epicycles - any time the prediction doesn\'t fit the data, just add another wave or adjust the relative sizes of the ones you already had drawn.\n\nI don\'t know if it\'s achieved \'idiom\' status, but I\'ve certainly heard it said that a theory capable of explaining anything, is capable of predicting nothing.': 2, "Bear market?

How many printed dollars exist? In Circulation $1.36* *Trillion worth of printed notes exist. How many dollars exist in bank accounts? $11.8 Trillion. And how much* *money exists as obscure contracts we call "derivatives?" Approximately $600 Trillion."*\n\n\nbeg the question, would it be matter if you can sell "derivative" of finite currency ? or is it better than printing invinite currency for eternity and sell more of it as "derivative" ???': 1, 'From a programmer\'s perspective, a finite money supply is *much* easier to implement than an unbounded one.  Record fields can be fixed length, one can use the programing language\'s native arithmetic ops instead of calling library routines to do the math, one can allocate all variables statically or on the stack (instead of using dynamic allocation) etc.  That holds not only for the core client and libraries, but also for all auxiliary software, like javascript on web wallets, accounting software, etc.\n\nSatoshi was a competent B-level programmer, because he was aware that many popular languages and applications -- like javascript, Excel, (g)awk, matlab -- use IEEE double precision floating point format for all numbers; and he knew that 2^51 (about 2.25 quadrillion) is the largest integer that can be safely handled in that format without rounding, leaving a couple of extra bits for safety during simple arithmetic.  (Most bitcoin developers who took over the bitcoin implementation seem to be C-level programmers, because they seem to have the same attitude towards floating point that Frodo had towards the Ringwraiths.)\n\nSo, that is almost certainly why the total number of atomic units was capped to about 2.25 quadrillion.  Those were to be the "bitcoin cents", playing for bitcoin the same role that the cents play for the dollar.  Then, when choosing the nominal unit (the "bitcoin dollar"), Satoshi picked 1 BTC = 100 million atomic units. That choice put the decimal point about in the middle of the range; namely, the maximum possible amount would be 22.5 million BTC (8 digits before the decimal point), and the minimum amount would be 0.01 millionth of BTC (8 digits after the point).  That choice made arbitrary BTC amounts maximally readable (or, rather, minimally unreadable) when printed, and was the least biased about the future value of BTC.\n\nNext he defined the block reward schedule.  It had to ensure the issuance of all the supply in a finite time.  Assuming optimistically that the value of a bitcoin would grow with time, it made sense to make the reward decrease with time.  Starting with some reward R and halving it every N blocks was the simplest schema that could do both things.  \n\nHe picked R = 50 BTC/block, and N = 210\'000 blocks.  Why those values? For any choice of R, there is a definite value of N that will result in just under 2^51 BTC being issued, ever: namely, N = 2^50 / R (rouding down).  A larger (or smaller) R would require a smaller (or larger) N, thus shortening (or lengthening) the time frame for issuance of the full supply.  There was no way of predicting how the price of bitcoin would evolve, and therefore no way to guess the best value of R in some economic sense.  However, setting R = 50 BTC/block (a nice round number) meant halving every N = 225\'179 blocks, which is about 4 years; which meant that half the coins would be issued in 4 years.  At the time, that must have seemed a reasonable choice.  Satoshi then rounded that N value down to 210\'000, which meant that the total number of atomic units would be a bit less than 2.25 quadrillion -- more precisely,   2\'099\'999\'997\'690\'000 satoshis = 20\'999\'999.976\'900\'00  BTC.\n\nSo, programmers\' laziness and compatibility with Excel and Javascript will probably prevent that limit from being raised much in the future.  (At most, it could be doubled -- 2^52 satoshis would still be marginally safe to use.) \n\nOn the other hand, a hard cap on the number of units does not protect against monetary inflation.  Some years from now, the People\'s Bank of Bitcoin in Beijing may decree negative interest rates -- namely, a mandatory transaction fee of (say) 2% on the amount of each input UTXO, for each year since the UTXO was created.

"For me, this business is half about coffee and half about my interactions with people and developing those relationships."\n\nWithin minutes, a woman is ordering a Japanese iced coffee.\n\nAfter the two talk briefly about the difference between Ethiopian and Rwandan coffee, she pays him in cash, takes her iced coffee and leaves.\n\nPrentiss starts to chuckle as he looks at the "Bitcoin Accepted Here" sticker, which has been plastered to the front of his mobile coffee cart for almost a year.\n\n"It\'s almost laughable because I am a push-cart vendor that accepts Bitcoin, and I\'ve only ever gotten two customers that have ever paid me in Bitcoin," the 30-year-old entrepreneur said as he put the money he just earned in a leather pouch. "It\'s just more of a conversation piece at this point than an actual practical thing."\n\nThe most common question he fields from inquisitive customers is simply, "What is Bitcoin?"\n\nBitcoin is a form of digital money or crytpocurrency. Just like sending an email, Bitcoin is transferred directly from person-to-person.\n\nUnlike the woman who handed Prentiss her money at the coffee stand, Bitcoins are transferred completely online rather than in the physical world.\n\nAn individual can purchase Bitcoins online through a Bitcoin exchange. Those Bitcoins will then be stored in an individual\'s digital wallet. Bitcoins can then be sent electronically through a computer or electronic device with the push of a button.\n\nOne Bitcoin equaled $244.27 on Monday. That would make a $3.50 iced coffee pour-over at the Coffee Pedlar worth .014 Bitcoin.\n\nDaniel Spuller, a self-described Bitcoin enthusiast and the cofounder of the Cryptolina Bitcoin Expo event held annually in North Carolina, said Bitcoin\'s decentralization is its most important characteristic.\n\n"No single institution controls the Bitcoin network. This puts some people at ease because it means that a large bank can\'t control their money," said Spuller, who served as the public information officer for North Carolina\'s Secretary of Commerce from 2013-14.\n\nThough each Bitcoin transaction is published online in a public log known as the block chain, the names of the buyers and sellers are never disclosed beyond their Bitcoin wallet ID number.\n\nA criticism of this feature is that it has helped Bitcoin become the preferred currency for people who are participating in nefarious activities online, like buying and selling drugs.\n\nDespite Bitcoin\'s originality, Mulligan said public awareness about the cryptocurrency remains low in WNC.\n\n"Whenever you see a magazine article on Bitcoin, what they do is they show those commemorative golden medallions that people made to promote or capitalize on the popularity of Bitcoin. But it\'s a virtual currency and doesn\'t exist like that," he said. "One thing that money should do is it should be a generally accepted medium of exchange. But for the most part, with Bitcoin you still have to go through this extra conversation. That may change as more merchants accept it, but at this point it is still not there."\n\n\'We were hoping some nerds would think it was neat\'\n\nWhile The Coffee Pedlar has had two customers pay in Bitcoin, it\'s more than Minick Law can say.\n\nAttorney Lance Williams, who pushed for the firm to start accepting Bitcoin, sighs before he begins to talk about the digital currency.\n\nDespite having law offices in Asheville, Charlotte, Gastonia, Hickory and Waynesville, no one has paid the firm in Bitcoin.\n\nWilliams, who has been practicing criminal and personal injury law at the firm for three years, said he thought accepting the digital currency would help the law offices to stand out and appeal to a variety of potential clients.\n\nThe firm was doing some work with a few South American clients last year. Rather than making them drive to a physical place to exchange their money for dollars, Williams thought converting their money into Bitcoin would be easier.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou scan it, money appears in my account and you pay me. That\xe2\x80\x99s the bottom line for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\nRyan Prentiss, The Coffee Pedlar\n\nAnd there was the novelty factor. "We were hoping some nerds would think it was neat and flock to us for that particular reason," he said.\n\nBut Williams said they aren\'t giving up on Bitcoin just yet. That\'s because it does not cost anything to accept Bitcoin.\n\nAs a solo entrepreneur, Prentiss said the no-cost factor was part of what prompted him to start accepting it.\n\nCompare that to Square, a point-of-sale app Prentiss uses to accept credit cards at his coffee stand. The service charges him a credit card processing fee of 2.75 percent on each sale made with a card. Bitcoin charges nothing.\n\nBut Prentiss said he tries not to get too wrapped up in the behind-the-scenes mechanics of each sale he makes.\n\n"You scan it, money appears in my account and you pay me. That\'s the bottom line for me," he said.\n\nReeds Jewelers sees Bitcoin success online\n\nLast summer, Reeds Jewelers started accepting Bitcoin on its website and at its more than 60 brick-and-mortar locations nationwide, including its storefront inside the Asheville Mall.\n\nThe jewelry company, which began almost 70 years ago in downtown Wilmington, was also the first retailer in the country to accept Bitcoin both online and in stores.\n\n"In today\'s world, you\'ve got to be able to give those customers what they want, whether it\'s Amazon checkout, Google Wallet or Bitcoin," said Mitch Cahn, the director of marketing and business development for Reeds Jewelers.\n\nThough Cahn said he was expecting to see the company\'s first Bitcoin transaction take place on the company\'s website, the first two Bitcoin payments actually happened in-store in Huntsville, Alabama, and in Baltimore.\n\nSince then, Cahn said the split between Bitcoin transactions and other payment methods has been "pretty 50-50."\n\nHowever, the retail jewelery store chain has noticed something unique about its customers that choose to pay in Bitcoins.\n\nThough Cahn was unable to disclose a specific dollar amount or range due to company policy, he did say that the average ticket total for Bitcoin customers is almost double the average ticket for other customers.\n\n"That tells me that people that hold Bitcoin tend to spend more than those paying with credit or cash," he said.\n\nDespite the success Reeds Jewelers is experiencing with Bitcoin, Cahn said more education is needed in the greater marketplace about what the currency is and how it functions.\n\n"I actually just did a roundtable discussion recently at a university. The kids were young and tech savvy and they had all these questions about it," he said. " I think the industry as a whole has got to do a better job of getting people to understand it."\n': 2, 'Full text please.
