In practice, the unemployed no longer eat (demand falls) and pizza gets more expensive as the remaining people with jobs compete for the smaller number of slices available (the price rises relative to wages).\n\nIt is also factually wrong to argue that the Fed caused the crisis on Wall Street. Low interest rates pushed housing prices up, but they did not create the glut of bad loans which lenders originated and then foisted on others (financial innovation in securitization meant that loan originators could now make money simply by pocketing loan-origination fees, and avoid holding any risk themselves -- which was the major reason for the deceptive teaser rates which would eventually spike -- they were designed to result in more fees when people were forced to refinance). Nor did the Fed have anything to do with the Wall Street companies which bought these mortgages and re-wrapped them into newly-rated "triple-A" securities which hide the massive risk of default through the misapplication of risk models. Nor did the Fed create even a single one of the billions upon billions of dollars worth of CDSs which Wall Street pumped out of thin air to mirror the performance of these housing CDOs since *there were not actually enough actual bad mortgages to meet the demand for these "triple-A" securities which seemed to offer a better return than alternatives*.\n\nPut simply, the financial crisis was created by systemic fraud in loan-origination and then the mispricing of risk by Wall Street which fed the market because it was a cash cow and then took its own risk models at face value and started holding billions of worthless securities. And this is self-evident from the timing of the crash as well -- in 2007 the market woke up to the fact that hundreds of billions of dollars of financial securities were worthless not because of any activity from the Fed, but rather because when the original 2-year teaser rates on these new and dangerous mortgages suddenly jumped into the double-digit range, default rates rose above 5 percent and the financial models used on Wall Street suddenly showed holders of these assets as on the hook for tens of billions of unexpected losses. People were suddenly losing 100% of the value of securities that were rated as if they could lose roughly 2% in the worst-case scenario.\n\nIf you think the Fed was forcing Wall Street to generate and hold worthless assets, you give them far too much credit. Alan Greenspan was calling the subprime problems contained in 2007 when the vast majority of the securitized loans held by Wall Street had not had their interest rates spike or even come close to doing so.

Absolutely not, and -- like Krugman and most other mainstream economists -- I would have preferred an approach that stabilized the money supply without simply giving cash to the banks responsible for the crisis. Direct cash transfers to individual households would have been a better solution (let them pay off their mortgages if they like). Also a greater emphasis on fiscal policy and infrastructure rollout, although at some point you do have to deal with the fact that every Wall Street firm would have died without Fed intervention, and it would have been political suicide for any government to preside over that, leaving Americans the effective choice of banking with either the Bank of China or HSBC.': -1, "Your evidence that the central banks did not stabilize British and US currencies is Zimbabwe?

When you start talking about the distinction between the commercial banks and the central bank, and how one helps the other, etc, you really are looking at the trees but not seeing the forest. The big picture is that the Fed and the commercial banks represent a single, monopolistic system that makes debt based currency possible, and that this system inherently depends on the existence of the Federal reserve. \n\nThe 12 Federal reserve banks all have presidents who are appointed by their respective bank's board of directors. Each of these presidents serve on the Federal Open Market Committee that sets monetary policy. The majority of the board of directors, 6/9, who elect these presidents who decide the nation's monetary policy are elected by the commercial banks. So the commercial banks really control the Federal Reserve and its policies. The commercial banks and the central bank represent one system. You could say that the Fed is like the banking system's elected government. \n\nThat system is essentially a monopoly system that makes debt based currency possible. That is, the vast majority of money created is created through commercial bank lending, which is possible because the closed nature of the system allows IOUs to be treated as money. This is only possible by reproducing the old system in which money was backed by precious metals through the use of a central bank which, in a sense, artificially recreates the effect of money being backed by some scarce commodity to prevent the system from unraveling. In this system, money itself becomes backed by debt so if that debt becomes bad, because people default, the money itself becomes bad. Fiat money depends on a society that is constantly and always capable of repaying its debts, -- that is to say, it depends on infinite growth of the economy -- and if at any time debts can't be repaid, you essentially have an old school run on the banks, only upon the entire system rather than specific banks. When the housing market collapsed, it wasn't the federal reserve that bailed out the banking system, it was the American people. \n\nSo, in my mind, it is entirely fair to say that central banks are an essential innovation for the possibility of debt based currency and its ability to run smoothly. Indeed, central banks are what gave rise to debt based currency, they represent the key technology that makes the system possible. But debt based currency is inherently riddled with problems, and to the degree that it is, the central bank is indirectly responsible for this simply because debt backed currency requires the central bank to exist.

It does a pretty good job of illustrating Apple's modus operandi on new features, especially those that involve securing financial details.\n\n> You may recall that when Apple introduced TouchID in Sept. 2013, its use was specifically limited to authenticating access to the iPhone itself, and for making purchases via iTunes (which includes self-purchases made with the Apple Store app at their retail stores). Only with next week's release of iOS 8 will developers have programming access to TouchID, a year later.\n\n> Apple is extremely cautious with features related to security and privacy. First, they want to ensure absolute security and privacy. But almost as important, they want to ensure the perfect customer experience. Anything that might detract from that experience is to be avoided, such as theft or misuse of personal or financial information.

In many European countries it's higher. \n\n- In most countries, fiduciary law requires investment strictly in the interests of the client. In many countries (US & Japan included), jurisprudence takes this to mean that a fiduciary party investing heavily in a market *where reasonable certainty of a widespread decline in values exists*, would be a breach of fiduciary values (a breach of contract entitling the client to damages, and possibly endangering one's fiduciary license basically).  \n\nSo, you may feel *personally* one way or the other about the neutrality of price levels, and might invest accordingly, but the institutional investors and mutual funds that comprise the largest slice of the financial markets in the US and Europe would basically have the contractual obligation to such expectation as a sell signal. You see this in practice in Japan, which is known for the exportation of its savings onto foreign financial markets ( such as Korea, Taiwan, India, HK). \n\n": 0, "Banks create money out of thin air via FRB, which is injected into the housing market.

Until the system ends up with only base money left, what economists call M0, which is what the central banks printed up as notes and coins in the first place. \n\nIf we did not have the FRB layer at all, deflationary money would be excellent. We would not have to continually create new money via credit issuances. Ordinary people's lives would improve because all productive and technological advances would be expressed as an increase in the value of money. Lending and borrowing could still continue but on a full reserve basis and not a fractional reserve basis. \n\nTherefore, deflation is only bad in a FRB credit money model.

(90 days after performance I got paid). The usual is either net 14 or net 30 for me. So waiting 5 days on payment isn't a big deal, especially because a lot of business to business is repeat business, i.e. there is a level of trust, and so waiting for payments isn't a big security issue.\n\nBut even for those for whom time is an issue, there are already companies servicing this need. e.g. you can send an invoice to a client, then sell the invoice to a collection agency.

Well I'm not, considering I know of no company trying to do this, and god knows how many bitcoin entrepreneurs and willing VC capital there is to give something like this a shot.\n\nB2B bitcoin payments are awesome, but no business wants that (holding bitcoin) right now. I don't in my business for example, despite holding bitcoin personally. Maybe in a few years.

So I sympathize with your skepticism of the Fed and fractional reserve banking, I too believe that the Fed shouldn't exist. However, unless I misread your post, you're extremely misinformed on the nature of fractional reserve banking. You won't create any deflation at all by paying off existing debts. Paying back that $1000 doesn't cancel out the tens of thousands that were created from you putting that $1000 loan in the bank. In fact, paying back that debt creates *more* inflation, because you've actually given the bank $2000! They got the first thousand when you deposited your loan in the bank, then they got the second thousand when you paid the loan back. They don't cancel out the first thousand when you repay it, they just add your payment next to your loan under the asset section of their balance sheet. Essentially, your debt allowed the bank to undergo two cycles of money creation. No money was removed from the economy at all. The only way to create deflation outside of central banking policy is to refrain from putting your money in the bank at all; that way, it can't get loaned out and new money can't be created from it. \n\nAlso, when the price of Bitcoin goes down, that means it's inflating, not deflating. For when the price goes down, you can't buy as many goods with the same amount of BTC. Bitcoin is not a consumption good in itself, it is a currency that people can invest in with their fiat. So, when the price goes down, that means people are selling their BTC, dumping it on the market, which makes the supply larger than the demand. Consequently, the value goes down. Don't think of BTC as a good in the same category as food or cars, think about it as a foreign currency. Lower BTC prices=an increase of supply over demand=inflation. Higher BTC prices=an increase of demand over supply=deflation.": 2, "I think you are looking at it from that one single banks perspective.  The system is made up of several fingers on the same hand.   \n\nThere simply must be something that we are not clearly stating or understanding.  \n\nThe banks foundation of created money is limited is some way.........this limit is based on the ratio of 10 to 1 fractional reserve lending. \n\nThe money supply is limited,  to some degree, even though the money layers on top of itself.  \n\nDebit is what builds the layers.  One real deposit turns into further deposits as this new money moves through the system.  \n\nSo the foundation of any banks ability to lend money is deposits on hand, real cash from it's customers, on hand.   That is the foundation, but from there layers are created, and each of these layers is debit,  the more the debit, the more the created money............\n\nso if you look at one individual bank you may say the repayment of debit does nothing to money supply,,,,,,,,but take one large balance sheet for all the banks particiapting in this system.........from that balance sheets point of view paying back the debit would reduce the layers, and therefor reduce the money supply.... \n\nWhat your saying would mean there is no limit......a 100 dollar savings account would and could turn into the whole money supply.  SO I doubt that is correct,,,,,,there must be some foundation, some limit.  \n\nso what is the limit on banks ability to create money?? \n\nand wouldn't the repayment of the layers and layers of debit lead to less money..............\n\nit's a house of cards,  if you take away some of the middle layers the top is effected right?\n\n": 1, "And this lady's and gentlemen is why people like me think it's fun to hang around bitcoin forums making fun of you guys. ": 1, "I used one bank in my example to simplify a very complex system of money creation. The entire system works the same way it would work with one bank, just multiplied by how many banks there are. The limit placed on the banks' ability to create money is the supply of money. The banks can undergo the money creation process constantly because the Fed is constantly printing money. I don't know how else to say it: paying off debt to the bank does not mean that they delete all the money that they created from the loan you deposited in the bank, that is physically impossible. Even if they took your deposited loan off their balance sheet when you pay your debt (which they don't), it doesn't make the money they created from that deposited loan magically disappear; people have that money, they spend it, they deposit it, other banks use it to create more money. The central bank keeps the process going by printing more money. That's how it works. ": 1, 'Paying down the debt doesn\'t contract the money supply, it expands it. When you take out a loan and put it in the bank, the bank doesn\'t care if that money came from a loan or not, they just add it to their balance sheet as an addition to their monetary assets. So, if you borrow $1000 from bank the bank and put it in your bank account, the bank doesn\'t add an earmark that says "this is debt." They simply treat the deposit as if they received $1000 of new money. So, when you pay the debt back, the $1000 that made up the principle loan is not cancelled out or removed from the balance sheet. You deposit your loan: the bank adds $1000 to its reserves, you pay back the loan: the bank adds another $1000 to its reserves. This means that your loan has added $2000 to the money supply, plus the fractional loans that come from it. They loan out fractions of the money that they *loaned you,* and when you pay the loan back, they loan out fractions of *that* amount of money. They strike nothing from the asset portion of their balance sheet in this situation, they only add to it.
