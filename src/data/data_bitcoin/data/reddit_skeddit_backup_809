People do need to understand the basic distributed ledger concept, since the mechanics of that directly translate into Bitcoin's innovative properties.

And then you still don't simplify much as the old system remains in place, which means more to maintain for the banks. \n\nAnd then there's the sheer resilience of decentralized systems.

In the US, money going between banks goes through clearing-houses.  Each Federal Reserve district bank (there are 12) runs a clearing house, and there are a few private ones also.\n\nRather than transfer money from one bank to another for every check and debit card transaction, what they do is total up all the daily transactions going in and out of a bank.  If the bank has a net outgoing amount, it sends it to a special account the clearinghouse set up just for that day.  Once all the banks that need to send are finished, the clearinghouse then distributes the funds to the banks that have a net incoming balance for the day.  When the process finishes, the special account should be empty (i.e. cleared), and is then closed.  In practice, it often isn\'t, and then the clearinghouse staff tries to figure out what to do with any shortages or surplus.\n\nThis process of throwing all the money into one account and then distributing it is simpler than each bank sending funds to many of the ~1000 banks that use the same clearinghouse.  Since the clearinghouse system dates back before computers, simple was good.\n\nIf funds have to go internationally, or between banks on different clearinghouses, then you have another step in between.  Thus in the worst case, when you make an ACH transfer to Coinbase to buy bitcoins, it has to go from your bank > your clearing house > their clearing house > their bank > appears on their account balance.  Since clearing only happens once a day, at the end of the day, that\'s why it takes 4 business days for Coinbase to deliver your bitcoins via ACH.  It takes that long for your money to show up.  If you add a credit card, you can buy instantly, because they have an alternate way to get paid in case the ACH transfer fails.  It can fail, for example, if there is insufficient funds in your checking account.\n\nACH, by the way, stands for "Automated Clearinghouse", and just means the payment info is going by computer instead of a paper check.

But presumably that means their value is essentially the risk-adjusted value of the debt they represent.  So in your example if I am not good for the $1 loan you gave me, the bitUSD you have will be worth zero.  I guess that as others will be making these loans, the risk is spread across the whole market and the value of a bitUSD will reflect how good borrowers as a whole are.  And I guess the further complication is that it\'s not just USD, bitshares will be backed by loans of all sorts of other assets.  Is that right?\n\nIf so, then presumably the notion of bitUSD being "pegged" only holds good if all the borrowers are 100% good for their loans?  Unless some central authority is going to step in to buy bitUSD at exactly $1 if the market won\'t.\n\nHave I got this wrong, or isn\'t this just classic naughty investment banking - packaging up debt so you can\'t see for sure how risky it is, then selling it to people who don\'t know what they\'re buying?': 1, 'I\'m not very familiar with the system, but I\'ll give my best shot:\n\nMy understanding is that a bitusd is really a digital token that represents a (interest-free) loan, in a sense. So let us say you and I want to create a bitusd. I give you a loan of $1. In exchange, we write up a contract that says you now owe me $1. This contract is what is called a "bitusd". It can be traded to other people and whoever has it can at any time come back to you and demand their $1. So the token is backed by $1 and you are the person backing it. \n\nNow, the catch is that the Bitshares exchange doesn\'t actually deal in fiat money, all transactions are done using bitshares the currency. So when I say I loan you $1, what I really mean is that I loan you $1 worth of bitshares. The main reason you would take this loan is in the hopes that the price of bitshares will rise relative to the dollar. When someone comes to redeem the bitusd token you are backing, you only owe them $1 worth of bitshares, so that if at the time the contract was initially made $1 = 1000 bitshares and if now $1 only  = 200 bitshares, you only have to pay 200 bitshares instead of the full 1000 you were initially loaned, and so you end up with 800 free bitshares, i.e. $4.\n\n(It reminds me of the situation with Butterfly labs, where they were taking pre-orders for miners that cost something like $20,000 or, at the time, 200 btc. A year later people still hadn\'t received their miners and demanded a refund. Butterfly labs refunded them in USDs and pocketed the 200 BTC which were now worth $200,000. Chi-ching!)\n\nNow you might be wondering, why not just buy bitshares from a normal exchange and hold onto them if you think the price is going to go up? The point is that Bitshares is the first real decentralized exchange where you bypass the risks that come from centralized exchanges like MtGox. \n\nAlso, you might be wondering why anyone would just buy bitusds rather than actual dollars? A bitusd is a way of locking in the price of your crypto-assets if you fear the price of those assets are going to go down relative to the USD. The question is, why not just buy actual dollars instead? Well, for one, actual dollars are fiat and thus carry all the frustrations and worries of dealing with the traditional exchanges, and they lack the benefits and ease of cryptocurrency. Trading crypto to crypto is much easier than crypto to fiat. Furthermore, every time you exchange crypto into fiat you are expected to pay taxes, similar to selling stock, which doesn\'t apply when you just trade from crypto to crypto. \n\nThe main real drawback to all of this is the fact that it all revolves around bitshares and is its own sort of isolated market which often involves having to deal with the centralized exchanges in order to move in and out of this system, which kind of defeat the whole purpose of bypassing centralized exchanges. It would be amazing if a system like this were developed for Bitcoin. Such a system would revolve around 2.0 protocols like Counterparty, Mastercoin, or Colored Coins. But so far these are quite cumbersome compared to Bitshares, and are lagging behind. But a decentralized exchange that pegs assets using Bitcoin could dramatically benefit Bitcoin and its future, which is why I am concerned that some of the core devs for Bitcoin are actually seeking to undermine 2.0 technologies.

Also, the USD inflation would appear to be 100 times larger if you decided to choose cents as the unit of the currency instead of dollars.  Clearly this metric is almost worthless.\n\nIf you go based on the market value of the coins then you get a little bit better indication.  However, I think that percentages are more honest.  If the adoption of Bitcoin remains constant and speculation doesn't have a large effect on prices then you would expect the value of 1 BTC to drop at about the rate that the currency supply is increasing, in terms of percentages.  Similarly, if the demand for USD stays constant then you would expect the value of the USD to drop at about the speed that the currency supply increases.  The USD can absorb a much larger influx of new currency than Bitcoin while having a much smaller effect on value.\n\nQuoting inflation rates in terms of percent per year is standard for a reason.

This jump appears slightly higher than normal, but it isn't an extreme outlier.\n\nConverting that figure to dollars per day gives about $1.3 billion/day.  This is about 0.047% per day.  Compare this to Bitcoin's daily production of 3,600 BTC (assuming 10 minute blocks) which is about $1.39 million/day, or 0.027% per day.  \n\nPicking a different month for the USD gives different results, though.  Going from April to May, for example, gives only $0.53 billion/day, or 0.019%/day.  Also, you could look at the differences using a broader definition of the money supply (e.g. M2, which includes savings deposits, or even M3 which includes time deposits and short-term repurchase agreements).\n\nUltimately Bitcoin's money supply increases are *kind of* close to being on par with national currencies.

We have many precedents for this, most recently, countries which adopted the USD at their de facto national currency, following a period of merchant rejection of the local currency. Rather than reject it outright, they simply discounted the USD price, as USD was perceived as more trustworthy and stable (rightfully).  \n  \nI keep an open mind with all things Bitcoin, so I'm not necessarily opposed to this view. However, I would want some further clarification, and a few things are not touched on:  \n  \n1) The author expects a 1, 2 punch from both the faultiness of fiat currencies and the power of Bitcoin. But frankly I'm not totally convinced. After terrible hyper-inflations in the past (and typically, they take between 5-20 years to clear through, just as an aside), gold and silver reemerged as a currency immediately following the collapse phase (the one where the currency becomes more useful for burning for heat than for buying bread). My question would be: what makes Bitcoin different than gold when compared to a failing fiat currency? Perhaps it is just that Bitcoin has so much room to grow upwards. If this is the argument, then I probably agree.  \n  \n2) Bitcoin bubbles are probably necessary as an ongoing phenomenon during the growth phase. But that doesn't mean they are helpful. Every single bubble is followed by a painful correction. The flurry of mining competition, infrastructure scrambles, early adopter diversification, and newcomer investment creates more chaos and potential for financial harm than it does benefit in the short term.  \n  \nThat said, I can't dismiss Dan's claims outright.
