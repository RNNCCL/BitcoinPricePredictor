Eventually that growth will yield the volume, or depth, needed to stabilize the currency.

It's likely that in the first year of huge bitcoin inflation most bitcoins were lost. \n\nThat is, Satoshi mined a million and probably has no access to them, or no interest to access them. Lots of people turned on their machine to mine and mined tens of thousands, before there was even a market price. And then eventually people still did that, while the market price of a bitcoin was about one thousandth of a penny. Imagine the care you have for a penny, then divide that by a hundred, and then imagine the penny couldn't be spent on anything except Alpaca socks, and you'd need a thousand of such pennies for that. The care you'd have for that penny would be close to zero.\n\nSo it's likely that a very large percentage of coins in 2009-10 and a significant percentage of coins in 2011, were lost due to a lack of care or interest. Remember that in 2011, the price began at less than $1. About 30 cents to be exact. The entire mining revenue of the entire world was $45 an hour. And that's 2011. Nevermind 2009-2010. At the end of 2010, there were already close to 8 million bitcoins in existence. (about 7.7 or so). More than half of all bitcoins we have today were mined during a time when the price of a bitcoin was in the pennies. Again, how much does one care for pennies?\n\nAnd it shows. Millions of bitcoins have never been sent, spent or touched. In fact, it appears close to 25% of all bitcoins are provably lost. (https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=675321.0)\n\nIn other words, with all the loss, theft, disinterest, carelessness, forgotten passwords and lost harddrives, at least 25%, and probably close to 40, perhaps 50%, of bitcoins are inaccessible.\n\nTo then create another 10% would be more akin to 20% growth of actual accessible bitcoins. It'd be the equivalent of pumping $1 into the economy for every $5 that exists. Put that into perspective for a second. The US money supply figure of M2 (used to target inflation) is $11.5 trillion. At bitcoin's inflation rate, we'd see an additional 2.3 trillion dollars pumped into the economy within a single year. It'd be as if every person in the US earned more than $7k extra out of the blue. You can be rest assured they'd spend it, and the price would drop a lot.\n\nAdd to that the likeliness that miners who saw their coin skyrocket in 2013 probably held on and are selling now, it's likely that there is a huge amount of mined coins being dumped.\n\nThat having been said, I *fully* agree that this doesn't explain a 70% drop. That's clearly related to other things (a price correction after a ridiculous 100x bubble while adoption only grew by 10x or whatever, as well as the Chinese market disappearing overnight as the government clamped down, as well as the biggest brand in bitcoin and holder of coin at the time, Mt. Gox, disappearing overnight and potentially dumping half a billion dollars of coin into the wrong hands). \n\nI appreciate that. But increasingly I hear people (not you in particular) who tend to underestimate mining as if it's just a small percentage and a little bit of inflation and super normal. But they forget that it's 10% over 13 million coins, while it's likely that at least 4 million coins and possibly 6m coins are on addresses to which nobody has access anymore. In that context, 10% becomes a lot more. And let's not forget what 10% is. It's 1.5m coins, at today's price that's close to $500 million. Now look at the orderbooks and we can easily observe the price would sit at a few hundred dollar more for a while if you had such a 0.5 billion dollar whale empty the books. It's really significant. I'm not saying mining is killing us, or that it's the cause of the price drop in 2014, or that without it we'd be above $1k a coin. But we shouldn't downplay it. Hell, it's a little more than a year before we'll see the rate half. And if we can have a stable price now (we've been at $320 for 3 months now) while $125m of extra coins were produced in those past few months, imagine what would happen when that rate gets cut in half.\n\nI mean, just look at the top two exchanges by volume, Bitfinex and Bitstamp. The former has a 17k coin ask orderbook, i.e. it's only an average of roughly $11m to match every single ask order at an average price of $650. And guess what the price of the last ask is? $1k. That is, if you clear the orderbook by spending $11m, the price on Bitfinex is $1k.\n\nBitstamp? I can't see without using their API, but from the limited graph it shows the orderbook goes up by $30 if you spend roughly $1m, if we assume that's a normal rate, you could go past $700 for roughly the same amount ($11m).\n\nNow put those two numbers into perspective, which is that we've created $125m of coins in the past 3 months alone, and $500m this year. Imagine if that hadn't hit the orderbooks, seeing how shallow they are and easily moved with a few million dollars.\n\nNow of course the order books will get replenished and more selling pressure arrives as soon as the price jumps. I know that. And I know that you can't spend $11m and see the price jump to $1k, it will only sit there temporarily before dropping down a few hundred. But I hope you see my point which is that 10% inflation is practically higher, perhaps even nearing 20%, and that this is really significant because even the largest exchanges have shallow orderbooks, and that $500m per year of less selling pressure on an exchange is actually huge, and that this effect is decreasing a little bit on a relative basis every 10 minutes, and drastically decreasing the summer after next.": 21, 'The Bitcoin tip for 1500 bits ($0.48) has been collected by *IkmoIkmo*.\n\n\n[ChangeTip info](https://www.changetip.com/tip-online/reddit) | [ChangeTip video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AnfKpypMNw) | /r/Bitcoin': 1, "So you agree that a technology/platform/company having people invested does not mean that it won't be replaced if something better comes along?

That is all. I think of Satoshi as the future IMF.': 1, "Absolutely, that's quite possible. I've given it some thought, some thoughts below:\n\nI personally look at his disappearance, and indeed his likely profile (academic, compsci) as one that is unlikely to also be one looking to make billions somewhere down the road.\n\nAnd if we assume then that he's not interested in billions, then he'd either have no interest in making a large amount of money at all, or does want to make money, but merely to pocket a few million, and stay anonymous, as opposed to billions.\n\nOn that first point (no interest to make billions), it's not unreasonable imo. Imagine you're anonymous, created something special, you're a geek, an academic, probably mature in the 2nd half of his life, educated without dire financial struggle, likely has an ideological interest in financial systems at least partially because the current one is corrupt, broken, greedy. Would you then likely be someone also looking to step out of the shadow, make billions, become one of the most famous people alive and never be able to go to the supermarket  without a bodyguard again?\n\nOn the second point, he might pocket a few million yes. But you mention he isn't cashing out now because it'd crash the market. But selling millions is already quite possible. Let's be frank here, bitcoin inflation is 10% a year. That's $500m at today's prices. He has $300m at today's prices. If anything is crashing bitcoin, it's not him selling $5m between 2011 and 2015 like he could have after his disappearance, so that he doesn't have to work another day in the rest of his life. The argument you make that he'd crash the market doesn't apply here, as selling $5m over the course of a few years amounts to a tiny fraction of a single percentage point of mining.\n\nOnly if he uncharacteristically, against the profile we assume of him (academic, ideological, anonymous and not wanting to be known, let alone well known, etc) wants to make billions of dollars, would he currently crash the market. But I just don't see that fit his profile, his lifestyle, his decisions and behavior.\n\nBut if he just wanted enough money to never have to work again and live quite luxuriously (in the millions) he would certainly not crash the market at all.\n\nSo why did he not touch the 1m coins, if he could have easily sold a few million dollars. It's perfectly legal. I think it's pretty likely, he never will. I think the chances are far better that after he disappeared, or while he was still there, he mined some cheap coins other than the 1m we know he mined in the first months, or hell, simply *bought* them for pennies, and has enough bitcoin to buy a house and live comfortably to never even consider touching the 1m bitcoins he may or may not have access to. \n\nThis way it's untraceable, he'll preserve his anonymity, and perhaps most important to him, **he'll achieve the greatest feat**: which is to preserve the *idea* of bitcoin, which is open-source and decentralized without an owner let into the world for everyone to use freely, rather than a pre-mined currency whose founder is the biggest owner and benefactor and most powerful and influential forever and ever. \n\nThat ideological reason, together with his anonymity, and the likeliness that he could be rich without touching those 1m bitcoins, is to me the reason why I think the odds are in favor of him never touching those 1m coins.\n\nRegardless, 1 upvote for your insightful post! /u/changetip.

It feels as if you're implying as if this statement carries any ideological meaning, as if to say Satoshi was against deleting keys out of some principle. It was just a statement for good practice. It doesn't seem to be the case that he said it out of principle at all (while his behavior to never touch his bitcoin does indeed seem to be out of principle, his disappearance is intentional)\n\nFor example he also said: Lost coins only make everyone else's coins worth slightly more.  Think of it as a donation to everyone.\n\nIt's likely he said these things in a conversational way, out of pragmatism, not ideology. To assume he didn't delete his wallet because of that remark is well, too assuming imo.\n\nIn any case, it may be a fair point to say he still has access to those keys. (although I think my post showed it's likely he has no intention of using them, and the blockchain shows he certainly never has). \n\nBut it doesn't really change the argument in the post before that, which is to say that 10% bitcoin inflation is practically far higher because there are millions of coins that are provably lost or provably not being used, and Satoshi's coins are among those, whether he has access to them or not, doesn't really matter for this point.\n\nAs for the IMF statement, that seems like a bit of a pipe dream but who knows.": 5, 'Not a concern ': 0, "I'm not blinded.\n\nPeople are already invested heavily in bitcoin and there is no reason they are going to jump to something with zero value and potentially buggy.\n\nIf the feature is important enough it will be merged into bitcoin.\n\nI have yet to see one example that cannot be merged or use proof-o-burn to preserve value.": 5, '>At the end of 2010, there were already close to 8 million bitcoins in existence.

If that wasn't the case, the price may have been a few hundred dollars higher. And of course this price effect has cascading effects. Just imagine that now, even if we get 1m new users per month buying $50 of bitcoin, like around Black Friday or the Bitcoin Bowl, the price doesn't budge, because we get about $50m a month in new coins. That's depressing in an economic sense (and an emotional sense for some). Now imagine the $50m new adoption wasn't met with $50m of new supply, you'd see the price grow by e.g. (making up a number here) $25 a month. And that's the kind of 'stable growth' that gets people excited, gets people buying and using and adopting and investing and talking. Before you know it you have another price rally on your hands. \n\nSo in short I really think the 11.1% mining is more significant (maybe 15%) and that even small amounts can tip the balance. If you have a bucket where you pour in 1 gallon per minute and take out 1 gallon per minute, it can be stable for centuries. But if you add even 1% to the supply, it'll overflow within an hour. Mining feels a bit like that. Like a bucket of bitcoin that is constantly being emptied and replenished by roughly the same amount. But if mining drops (e.g. by 50% in the summer after next), I think that proverbial bucket will empty soon, and that increased scarcity will cause price growth, and that price growth will spark investment interest that sparks new growth. And that's why I think we shouldn't underestimate the effect of mining, and expect block reward halving to potentially have a very significant impact.\n\nThanks again for pointing out my mistake!": 2, "Oh sorry, say hi to your son Satoshi for me, you probably know these things for certain, seeing as you're personally related and all. :D\n\nIn all seriousness... Perhaps 'probably' isn't the best word, it implies more likely than not... But I definitely think there's a very good chance. Not by incompetence or anything like that, rather because of the way he spoke about his project, the way he behaved towards his mined bitcoin so far, and the value of bitcoins during the time he acquired them.\n\nLet's be clear here, Satoshi is generally believed to own a lower-bound of 1 million coins. It's been looked into quite a lot (for obvious reasons). And we can see those blocks in the blockchain. Literally zero of them have been spent, except 1 block (back when the reward was still 50 btc) of which 10 btc were to Hal Finney, rest in peace. That's the way he behaved towards his bitcoin.\n\nIt's quite likely Satoshi did this for a blend of intellectual, academic and political reasons. That's what his behavior suggests, as well as how he spoke on the project when he was still around. Create something, make it open-source, mine a million coins now worth $300m, never spend a single one except for test transactions to fellow cryptoguys years back when bitcoins didn't even have value for testing purposes. That is what we know. It doesn't appear like he is intending to profit off of those coins.\n\nAnd lastly, when he acquired the bitcoins, they were worth nothing. Literally, they had no price. Even when they got a value, it was a fraction of a penny, and you couldn't spend it anywhere. It's the equivalent of someone having a World of Warcraft account with 0.001 silver on it, only you could spend your WoW silver on something, not bitcoins though. You can imagine how careless or uninterested one would be in properly saving those keys. I'll mention this in a second.\n\nEverything would suggest either of two things. \n\n1) he doesn't have access to those coins anymore. Not out of stupidity, but simply because they had no value. Remember he mined these before there was ever a bitcoin payment done (the first was in February, 10k bitcoin for $25 of pizza, or a quarter of a penny per bitcoin.) It's not exactly, but a little bit like expecting Notch (founder Minecraft) to have saved the first maps of Minecraft he used for testing.\n\nor 2) He may or may not have access, but is unlikely to ever use the bitcoins. Again, all known bitcoins have been untouched to this day. Despite the fact bitcoin is likely legal where he lives. Despite the fact he can likely sell them without revealing himself. Despite the fact he probably has more bitcoin than he needs even if he spent $1m every month for the rest of his life. \n\nSo I think by now we can conclude that he has no access. Either because he never saved the early keys (by choice or because it didn't matter to him), or because he doesn't want to access those bitcoins. And if he does want to make some money off bitcoin, it's MUCH more likely imo that he mined some in 2010 and 2011, that nobody knows are his. \n\nAn additional fact is that he disappeared, and that this is probably not without reason. If one doesn't want to work on it anymore, or maintain it, one can casually keep hanging around, stay in touch every now and then, perhaps spend or at least test-send some of the 1 million bitcoins one has. They were already worth millions by the time he disappeared without ever having used those coins. Yet he chose not to casually hang around, or leave some contact details somewhere. He full out went MIA intentionally. A man who wants nothing to do with his creation and never touched his own coins worth millions, doesn't look like he either has access to them or wants access, which is all the same in a practical sense.\n\nGiven this reasoning, I don't think it's unreasonable to say that it's likely we'll never anyone touch those 1m bitcoins we know he mined. Whether he could, then, isn't very relevant.\n\nFeel free to elaborate why you disagree.": 6, "I'm also liking changetip.

It means that an address is only used once. The life-cycle of an address would be: inception through coinbase transaction; destruction when spent. The address can be seen as a coin.\n\nNow, if I am not mistaken, the transaction history becomes irrelevant. An address (coin) can only occur once in a transaction. When used, the address is destroyed and a new address / private key pair is created. The blockchain holds the new address, and only the receiver can derive the corresponding private key.\n\nThere would still be a blockchain, but used addresses can be discarded, effectively discarding the transaction history.

I don\'t know why this is getting heat (well, I do - its the bitcoin subreddit).\n\nFact of the matter is, the smart consumer uses a credit card and pays off in full, even if its technically exploiting a system on the backs of not smart spenders. The upper echelon of smart consumers do what is known as churning, where they creatively come up with ways to manufacture spend (primarily for the purposes to sign up for new cards to get sign up bonuses) while paying zero in interest+fees and maintaining a flawless credit score. The end goal of churners is basically being able to earn free flights/hotel stays/etc on a yearly basis.\n\nMost credit card users don\'t hit near that (and if they did, it wouldn\'t exist). But a smart consumer should use a credit card because it simply beats everything else out there - its backed by a company (that can be dropped at any moment, so competition is fierce), and the losers of the credit card system (those who get in loads of CC debt) "pay all the bills" so to speak. If you know how to keep track of spend, and pay your bill off every month (AKA use your credit card as if it were cash) then you actually win big time vs spending on any other method. Literally earning potentially hundreds of dollars a year in rewards, free flights/hotel stays, free extended warranties on everything you buy, free rental insurance, etc. All the while you increase your credit score which lets you save huge on a home/car loan (and qualify for top tier rewards cards).\n\nBeing a consumer who uses cash is a suckers game compared to someone who can use a credit card and use it well.\n\nHow can bitcoin compete against that? Well, maybe it can\'t. Or maybe Bitpay will become the company that allows it to happen. Or maybe even we\'ll see credit cards spring up that are backed in bitcoin, not USD. \n\nI know credit cards are a more foreign concept outside of the US for many countries, but in the US (and many other foreign countries to be honest) the smart consumer always uses a card, because if you can use one right it is literally better than cash in every way for zero downside and is incredibly pro consumer.

So there is a clear link from your circle account, to your address, to a possibly known market address, and subtract them all and your change address is known as well. To do any sort of tumbling with HD, you would have to send at least a few random transactions to yourself. Then at least you could claim that those coins were sent to someone else. But it\'s still not guaranteed, or the best way. Wait until Mycelium implements CoinJoin to do true tumbling, and for now use something like DarkWallet (which uses CoinJoin), an actual tumbling service, or as a last resort the blockchain.info tumbler. I don\'t shop at markets, but for privacy I create a throwaway addres on blockchain.info wallet, send money there, send it through their tumbler back to my wallet, and delete the address after I\'m done.': 2, "Not too well. If the market gives a bunch of people different deposit addresses, and then sends their combined income for the day to another address (into cold storage for example), all those addresses will be used in the same transaction as being spent from, linking them all together (CoinJoin is what breaks this assumption). The main worry is that if the market is ever taken down, and its address list is exposed by some authority, they will be able to know all the addresses that send money to that market. Then it's just a matter of finding out whom those addresses belong to, and they can just ask Coinbase/Circle for some of that info.\n\nAlso, please check this http://www.walletexplorer.com/ There is a way to  track at least some of the addresses from various markets.": 1, 'I am trying to keep the government out of my finances.
