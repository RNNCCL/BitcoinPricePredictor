Our BIP101-supporting bitcoin clients were seeing the best chain as being 584xxx blocks long even though they recognized the existence of a 6008xx block long competing chain because the 584xxx block chain had the most work.\n\nRead [this link](http://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/29742/strongest-vs-longest-chain-and-orphaned-blocks) for another source stating that the actual requirement is the most work. "Longest" is often used as a shorthand version of saying "most-work", but number of blocks is not the metric. It usually doesn\'t matter, because on mainnet the amount of PoW per block doesn\'t vary much. On testnet it did, because testnet is nutty.\n\n> the block explorers are absolutely reliable because they don\'t accept blocks of arbitrary form.\n\nBlock explorers are absolutely not reliable.

One issue is that the bitpay [test-insight server](https://test-insight.bitpay.com/blocks) is allowing BIP101 blocks (we saw them there earlier, about 24 hours ago), but it\'s not following the most-work rule. This is the incorrect behavior that I was referring to. The other block explorers are rejecting BIP101 blocks as they were designed to, which is correct behavior.\n\n> But you are right in that block explorers shouldn\'t be trusted for finance (or even experimental testnets which is why I wonder why people want block explorers to use an experimental branch).\n\nBecause it\'s faster for reviewing a large amount of information than using bitcoin-cli. We use the command line when making sure of things. We have seen (as expected) that the results from the command line often differ dramatically from what is shown on the explorers. That\'s no big deal, it just slows us down. The explorers not showing our branch does not make them useless, though, because they still show what is going on with the other branches. A fork test is of no use unless there are at least two branches.

I got rather confused by that, but even though Core was over 1000 blocks ahead of XT, all of the XT nodes stayed together.\n\nWe had some difficulty goofs of our own, too. At some point, we crossed a difficulty adjustment border. A few other people mined some blocks when I was otherwise busy, and then when I was ready to mine, I didn't know the difficulty was different. I pointed a half SP10 at my poolserver, and then mined at up to 100 blocks per second. Many of the blocks arrived at other nodes in reverse order. It was interesting.\n\nLater, I got the CPU mining thing worked out, and we mined about 6 full 9.1 MB blocks in a row. We had a reorg in the middle of it, though, so I think we were having some connectivity problems from insufficient node coverage. One of my nodes also wasn't following the rest for a bit.\n\nWhen it functions properly, it seems that block propagation for 8 MB blocks may be around the 5s to 15s mark. It appears that a lot of that time is due to block validation; the network transit time appears to be pretty low in our configuration. TCP slow start does not appear to be as much of an issue as I was expecting.\n\nI'm currently not mining on XT because I found that leaving it for CPU mining when possible was more convenient.\n\nEdit: I'll post a transcript from #bitcoinxt of today's testing on /r/bitcoinxt in a bit.": 11, "Great job guys.

With the drastic difficulty adjustments that happen on testnet (e.g. 100000 difficulty for one block, then 1 for the next), and the fact that difficulty is dependent on the node's timestamp (which can and does get manipulated) rather than the block height, things are pretty chaotic.
