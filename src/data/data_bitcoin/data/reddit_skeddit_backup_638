They explicitly said that it's not a speculative asset, yet people treated it as such, and they sold amounts (controlling the amount & the price) to the tune of something like $15 million, as if it was a speculative asset. That's clearly bullshit because its price doesn't have anything to do with its value of its function, and as it's not an asset class, there's no reason for it to be priced as such.\n\nAdd to that the fact that development shouldn't rely on Ethers (any decent company allows developers to develop using a testnet with fake ethers), and that ethers will always remain available (and again, aren't a speculative asset, thus shouldn't explode in value), there's absolutely no reason to sell them at this point.\n\nSo why do they deserve money? For their development, of course. That's completely fine. So you raise VC money. Or you crowd-fund. But they didn't do that, they essentially ended up selling a development token for a speculative price.\n\nAnd how much did they raise? I think about $15m. iirc, the 5-year budget for the bitcoin foundation was about $5m. So they pulled 3 pulled in something like 3x the budget that the Bitcoin Foundation has had for the past 5 years with which it funded a large part of the core developers and bitcoin core's development.\n\nYet currently it's still technically vaporware.\n\nIs it a scam? One part of me wants to say 'clearly no'. There's an interesting concept and quite a bit of expertise and a number of proof of concepts. So for them to get $1m to fund a team of 5 engineer up to 2017 years with an ample $200k a year salary to develop something concrete is fine by me. The other part of me wants to say 'it smells fishy', they raised a huge budget compared to what they've produced. They push this bs marketing message 'turing-complete' all.the.freaking.time, it's mostly a bs technical buzzword that's receiving a lot of flack, it's fine to have it or even talk about it, but the way it's pushed so hard feels scammy. Add to that the fact it looks like whatever they're doing can be implemented in a sidechain, it just feels as if raising $15m for vaporware is disproportionate.": 8, 'On the sub reddit ': 1, 'I think it is astonishing how so many people write ethereum is a scam and they have nothing to show for.

This solves the major weakness in Tor (i.e., correlation attacks), and also makes it much harder to steal or corrupt data.\n\nThe Safecoin currency built in is intended primarily to incentivise contributing resources to the network. Where it differs from Bitcoin is that instead of using a blockchain for transaction confirmation, it has a peer consensus model. This means full anonymity, instant confirmation, zero blockchain bloat, and essentially unlimited transaction volume.\n\nEven if Safecoin never competes with Bitcoin as a primary currency, the network solves a lot of logistical issues with Bitcoin such as securing wallets, hosting bloated blockchains, etc.\n\nObviously the system is enormously ambitious.

For example, it\'s one thing if I open a marketplace and simply charge a fee to each retailing booth (that\'s how my local farmer\'s market is run).  It\'s quite another if I open a similar marketplace, but now I (as the owner of the place) am personally responsible for each of the goods and services sold at that market.\n\n\nThere\'s no way that I would be able to run around and check on everyone doing business to ensure whether or not they\'re compliant to each of the laws governed by each of their respective jurisdictions.\n\n\nI call tell you for starters, we\'d have no more farmer\'s markets or flea markets.  Take a website serving an international clientele, and the problems multiply by orders of magnatude. \n\nA much more simple approach is to just allow for an open market.  Inform buyers that it their responsibility to learn and to adhere to the laws that govern them. If you live in Afghanistan (where alcohol is illegal) don\'t accuse and shutdown eBay if someone living there bought alcohol off eBay.  On the other hand, if someone in the US buys hashish off an eBay like site, don\'t charge eBay. Charge the person who bought the drugs since that\'s the laws they\'re under.\n\nIt\'s already illegal to do many of these alleged crimes made against this kid. If that\'s the case make the bust in the crime itself, not the avenue or arena that provided the place for it to happen with. \n\nBy the logic the government uses, cars should be illegal since they often serve at the purposes of someone doing something illegal. No.  Charge for the crime itself.  Don\'t charge the owner of the night bazaar, or the ISP service that someone used to do something illegal through, or the fiber-optic\ncompanies, or the computer manufacturer.

Information is free.  There\'s always information around covering how to do any number of illegal things.  From uranium-235 distillation to building chemical reactants, to yes, I\'m sure, how to ship things illegally.  The entirety of the world\'s information is out there, however difficult some slices of it may be to gain access.  It\'s an impossible task to attempt to censor every little piece.  The federal government in its attempt to do so, has banned public algorithms, certain large prime numbers, and even modest keys, such as those used for digital rights management.  And it\'s a losing battle.  At the end of the day, if someone commits a crime, they need to be simply charged for that crime.\n\n\nIf the Silk Road had a page describing how to evade customs handlers (I\'ll take your word for it that they had) then the question I\'d ask is: "Is that illegal?"  If so, charge the responsible party.  If not, move on to the next charge.  Customs officers can take care of themselves;  they have plenty of means and expertise to do their job.  Charging the site operator (who I understand was not specifically selling illegal goods himself) makes no sense to me, and leads to an unwise and possibly dangerous precedent.\n\n\nIt\'s cases like this Ulbricht one, that cause me to question the prosecutorial zeal of the DOJ.  And at the end of the day, is it "justice" to send a kid to jail for the 30 or so years, for what he did--even if the court finds it is a crime?  I wouldn\'t want anyone\'s son or daughter to go away for that long.  That\'s not justice.  And where are the victims of his alleged crimes?  If the Silk Road served as a platform to allow drug sales, it seems to me that\'s a transaction between what\'s likely to be consenting adults.
