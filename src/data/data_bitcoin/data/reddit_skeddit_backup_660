A bit like how the ideas of the founding fathers are still debated to this day. \n\nFor me, holding your own bitcoin is a bit like privacy: it's optional, but it must be ensured and must remain possible without requiring permission.\n\nThat is, it's my choice to keep my income, my sexual orientation, my political leanings etc private. Nobody has the right to this information, and I require no permission to keep this information to myself.\n\nBut generally I do disclose this information to friends and family, colleagues or even institutions.\n\nFor me bitcoin is like that. It's my choice to keep my own bitcoins, nobody has the right to force me not to, and I require no permission to hold bitcoin. \n\nBut generally I do keep some of my bitcoins with third parties. But the very fact alone that I don't need them, is an element that keeps them in check. \n\nBeyond that though, 'being your own bank' is something that isn't super prevalent because it's hard, not because people are opposed to it. It takes time to develop tools, instruments and education around this. Just like running your own production studio was hard 20 years ago, you needed tens of thousands of dollars for cameras, studios etc. Today you can shoot youtube film or music on your phone and edit it with a free app for free without any real education. In bitcoin we're already seeing some of this emerge. Coinbase for example now offers a multi-signature vault. They handle cold storage and security. But you handle the keys, hold autonomy over your own money. Over time holding your own money with the use of redundant third-party services will be so easy, many more people will do it. \n\nIn any case, it's really, really crucial to appreciate the difference between a decentralized network, and a decentralized industry. Humans tend to centralize. Look at cities. They arise because one village is a little bit bigger than the other village, which means there's a little more jobs, a slightly bigger economy, meaning there's more production, more art, more activity, more human interest. So it attracts more people. And eventually you get something like New York or Paris and everyone wants to go there, and people flee rural areas. That's not bad per se. Bitcoin, and many technologies like it, are similar. It happens mostly because of network effects, path dependency and economies of scale. But it's okay, as long as there is an open protocol underneath it, because if there is, there's no longer a single point of control. However awesome company X built on top of protocol Y is, if Y is open to anyone, and X starts to suck, then X has no way of controlling what happens on protocol Y. It's open, permissionless, and soon X will be out of a job. Look at the Internet, how many internet companies failed when they started to suck, because they couldn't prevent you from taking your internet connectivity somewhere else. Then look at Comcast, and you can see what happens if there is no open and permissionless system for competitors, they can suck and survive. Bitcoin isn't like that. \n\nDoes that mean huge monopolies aren't bad? Sure they are, but there isn't much room yet for many competitors. Look at Bitpay, they process about $1m a day. And that's with 0% fees. Their old 1% fees means they'd make 300k per month. That's not even enough to staff 25% of their team, and they don't even charge the 1% anymore. They're probably deeply unprofitable losing a few million a year (which is okay, they have $33m in funding) hoping to grow with the ecosystem. Coinbase is similar. My point is, with unprofitable companies processing small amounts of payments, there's not that much room for many other companies.

In this case the consensus mechanism is perfect (but prone to 50% attacks, game theoretic attacks and so on.)\n\nBut if you consider a concrete system, PoS and PoW have very similar requirements, but PoS is less susceptible to the aforementioned attacks.\n': 2, "The balance between supply/demand is *the only thing* that's factored into pricing bitcoin.

They do not provide new information, but are merely verbal or tautological, asserting what has already been implied in the definitions and premises. Only experience can lead to synthetic propositions. There is an obvious objection against this doctrine, viz., that this proposition that there are no synthetic a priori propositions is in itself \xe2\x80\x94 as the present writer thinks, false \xe2\x80\x94 a synthetic a priori proposition, for it can manifestly not be established by experience.

The point probably hardest for you to understand is price.\n\nWhat many miss (including Peter Schiff) is Bitcoin is a *currency*. It's not a stock. Price declines can be (and are, for now) a good thing because it's not reflective of disappointing performance of an underlying company. Instead, it's reflective of failure of demand at a certain price level to keep up with the early heavy inflation of the currency. However, the lower the price goes the easier it is for demand to keep up with that inflation.\n\nSo, how is that a good thing? A currency isn't useful if only one person uses it, as was the case when Satoshi first launched Bitcoin. A currency gains more value the more people use it. Say Satoshi set up the model so he could mine 20 million bitcoins the first day himself, leaving 1 million for the rest of the world. How successful do you think that would have been? There are already over 10 million bitcoins in existence. If the above happened each bitcoin would already cost over $10K each. Yet fewer than 1 million people would have them. It would be silly for another 10 million people (let alone more) to try to participate in such a lopsided economy. There wouldn't be any room for growth, hence no justification for $10K bitcoins. The price would implode. \n\nOTOH, if you allow enough time for wide access to coins, including at lower prices, it strengthens the currency overall, as more people have them.

Similarly, although the independent auditor is informed in a general manner about matters of commercial law, he does not purport to act in the capacity of a lawyer and may appropriately rely upon the advice of attorneys in all matters of law. [Paragraph renumbered by the issuance of Statement on Auditing Standards No. 82, February 1997.]\n\n>In the observance of generally accepted auditing standards, the independent auditor must exercise his judgment in determining which auditing procedures are necessary in the circumstances to afford a reasonable basis for his opinion.

Things don't just happen for free.\n\n And without something like an audit you would have no way of knowing that the company could be doing something like using its reserves as collateral to take out loans for a neat cafe they wanted to build, which if it failed could mean they're all of a sudden insolvent.

In fact, reconciling our bank statements with our accounting records was one of the easiest and most trivial parts of the entire process.  The same was true for reconciling our non-cash assets as well.  Proving you have the cash (or other assets, including bitcoin) you say you do is incredibly simple and doesn't actually mean you're solvent.  \n\nA bitcoin exchange is orders of magnitudes more complex than the organization I was working with during the audit.  A proper audit requires a group of people (because having a sole auditor jeopardizes the integrity of the audit) with experience and tools.

From across the Atlantic magazine writer Kevin Bitcoin Cruz gives the answer. Recently, Kevin completed a month-long experiment Bitcoin survival, this time, he had an unforgettable experience of going to the dentist, also dated beloved girl ...... Recently, Kevin received the "IT Times" reporter\'s interview.\n\n**Love adventure, so the challenge.**\n\nLate one night, Kevin received a strange phone number, the other from Bitcoin company Brawker, proposed a unexpected proposition: to live with the bitcoin month. The other said, in this month which will help Kevin to live as much as possible. "I love adventure!" Kevin said. Eventually, he gladly accepted the challenge.\n\nNormally, Kevin lives in his aunt\'s apartment in New York, so he does not need to pay rent or electricity, do not need to buy gas. For Kevin, it is necessary to spend monthly mobile phone bills, food and so on.\n\nThese are very simple. By Brawker website, Kevin created an order, and within an hour after the release, received a phone operators can provide payment password; food is a large block overhead, Kevin bought a food gift card, buy a sufficient refrigerator filled with organic food, he even paid the bill on college loans through bitcoins.\n\n**The Bitcoin "play bad."**\n\nAfter the bills, food ...... when no longer have to "livelihoods" worry, Kevin found that he had a lot of BT currency balances, which since then that colorful life Bitcoin provide adequate funding for him.\n\n**Dentist: Bitcoin can not pay painkillers**\n\nOne night, Kevin found a home in New York dentist accept Bitcoin payments. So he booked a basic teeth cleaning. "Your wisdom teeth need to be removed." Dentist said. Think of the bitter experience of my friends when wisdom teeth removed, Kevin rejected the dentist\'s kindness. After the adoption of the two-dimensional code scanning Bitcoin wallet, payment amount recognized finished, Kevin left.\n\nHowever, a few days later, Kevin began to worry about wisdom teeth will affect the growth of the other, so he went to the dentist courage again, this time he decided to unplug the sinking wisdom. But then, he immediately regretted. No prescription painkillers (Bitcoin can not pay these drugs), Kevin tasted terrible pain. A few days later, the swelling of the cheeks to make him very uncomfortable, but unfortunately, the next Kevin can not eat the whole week he has reserves of any food in the refrigerator.\n\n**Dating: others said do not believe to be true Bitcoin**\n\nOn his way to attend a gathering of Bitcoin, Kevin in the corner met a girl to his heart. As eager to participate in the meeting, Kevin and the girls did not talk much, he wants the girl\'s contact details. A few days later, Kevin had an Italian restaurant and a girl on the first date.\n\nCandlelight, wine, food, they talk very happy.\n\nPayment, Kevin took out his smartphone. Kevin sweep aside the girl saw the two-dimensional code after payment bitcoin situation, telling him, "I do not believe that Bitcoin is true, until there are a lot of people use ......"\n\n**Look musicals: so incredibly surprised at the scene**\n\nIn Times Square, walking, Kevin saw a gleaming symbol: Broadway musicals. Perhaps everyone will suddenly flashed in the moment a strange idea, at that moment, Kevin thought: I must see this musical.\n\nLuckily, Kevin successfully using bitcoins to buy tickets for this musical.Programs are very memorable, Kevin felt that a group of talented people can get together, really incredible.\n\nMonth, Kevin, there are many similar experiences. For example, he used the money to buy a bit of a MIDI keyboard to make music, attend yoga classes, such as airline booking.\n\n**Enough, want to try again**\n\nBitcoin is amazing, Kevin told reporters that Bitcoin is an Internet-based currency. He believes that Bitcoin will likely change the world financial situation, "This is an unprecedented social phenomenon."\n\n"Bitcoin has its own advantages, in case you can not produce any charges will be varying amounts of money into any one place in the world." Kevin told reporters, "but it can change the entire remittance industry."\n\nAt the end of 2014, a month-long experiment bitcoins over, "I feel like a pioneer, not just because I used to live a bitcoin, more importantly, I bought those can improve the health and well-being of my something that I can have my farm, my music can do ...... "Kevin said, plans to try this experiment.\n\n**Dialogue Bitcoin boy**\n\n**IT Times:** When Brawker company proposal to use Bitcoin life, why do you immediately said yes?\n\n**Kevin:** Actually, I had seen Brawker Company. I think that the creation of Brawker Bitcoin\'s idea is very interesting, and I also know that life will depend on Bitcoin bit risky. But it is important, I like adventure.\n\n**IT Times:** When using bitcoins to life, the greatest difficulty you encounter what is?\n\n**Kevin:** When I walk in the streets of New York, if when I am hungry, you\'re in trouble. Bitcoin currency did not become mainstream, I\'m unlikely to go to any restaurant or deli around me to buy food. At this point, I need to pick up my phone, find the nearest restaurants accept bitcoin. Then, flew past.\n\n*IT Times:** Bitcoins can be used on which devices compared to Paypal or Appale pay, what do you think is more convenient??\n\n**Kevin:** Bitcoin can be used on all networked devices including mobile phones and computers. In use, I personally feel that bitcoin is more convenient than Paypal, As Appale pay, I have not used, but I can imagine it is a very good mobile trading platform.\n\n**IT Times:** The United States used the popularity of bitcoin to what extent?\n\n**Kevin:** The United States has a lot of small deals to accept bitcoin, but has not yet become mainstream. United States to accept bitcoin large companies and websites have Dell, Bloomberg, Reddit, TigerDirect and so on.\n\n**IT Times:** We know that Bitcoin has its own advantages and disadvantages do you think it does not it?\n\n**Kevin:** I think Bitcoin is a very strong and powerful experiment, if successful, would be an important step in human progress; if not, there will also be a better version appears. Bitcoin disadvantage lies in its variability, you can expect a long time to maintain the value of the currency, but Bitcoin can not. In addition, the use Bitcoin relatively narrow range, a lot of dollars can be used in places not use bitcoins.\n\n**IT Times:** Out of geeks, how to get people to accept bitcoin and use, or that do not belong to those who Bitcoin?\n\n**Kevin:** I think let more people use Bitcoin, the key is to have an easier way to understand and easy to operate, and now a lot of developers do this. Bitcoin is an internet currency, and I believe it will become a future means of payment.

": -1, 'Free market does not mean "free from regulation."  It means free from violently imposed monopolistic regulation.  Your mental laziness is almost insurmountable if you think people cannot organize themselves freely.  Common law is a very simple concept and it has worked without government imposed monopolies.   It\'s about discovering the technologies and systems that *we choose* to be a part of in order to minimize our risk, secure our property, and peacefully associate with each other.  Where that *doesn\'t occur,* or where the solution is inadequate, people **are free** to leave the network or system and try something different.  Exchanges where you keep your Bitcoin stored are a good example.  Eventually there will be a solution to having a fast, responsive, and live trading market without one giant point of failure.  When that happens it is likely that network will grow quickly (or slowly until another big hack happens at a centralized exchange).  \n\nA free market means you try to protect yourself without shooting or hurting other people.  If your method doesn\'t work, then you search for another, but you simply can\'t force, shoot, inflict violence, or coerce someone else to get what you want.  Keep in mind, every regulatory responsibility the government has over education, the medical field, security, insurance, or anything else was **first an invention of someone trying to solve a problem before the government took it over, monopolized the industry, and outlawed competition.** Also remember that historically, with the most insignificantly tiny number of exceptions, this process is done almost *exclusively* to benefit one private business *over another.*. Go back a hundred years when Medical licensing was monopolized and then check out what the *competitors* of the American Medical Association were up to.  The AMA complained that if prices kept *falling* it would be impossible to provide medicine.  And thus the monopoly licensing is granted to the biggest market dominator of its day (go figure).  A century later, same company, same controls, and endlessly rising prices without hope of competition or alternatives.  \n\nTL;DR Monopoly regulation has **always** been enforced in order to give one company an advantage over another where it couldn\'t be obtained (or was too difficult to obtain) in a peaceful manner.  Therefore they used the moral exception of government to steal, control, and destroy their competition (for the greater good of course).  Forever entrenching their market power, by eliminating the market altogether.  You are either an idiot, or painfully brainwashed, if you can somehow miss that the vast majority of regulation in the economy is voluntarily agreed upon and imposed.

The free market argument makes zero implication that there are angels everywhere.  In fact the argument is the *exact opposite.*  There most definitely *are not* Angels that can decide everything perfectly and without error and therefore putting anyone in a position of violently enforced power based on some poll, or popularity contest is painfully stupid.  It simply centralizes and increases the overall reach and impact of human error.  If everyone is fallible, there are scammer and trolls, and people who wish to act violently against others, then the last thing we could possibly want is violent, monopolistic market control of rules of behavior.  We want them to be decided on and agreed upon by people trying what works and what doesn't.  Government does a million things that haven't worked for decades or even centuries but because there is zero incentive to change they keep repeating the exact same failed ideas *without allowing any alternatives whatsoever.*  You suggest that we can get a tiny group of people to come up with a SINGLE solution for 300 million diverse people and that everything will work out great!  \n\nIt still just blows my mind that people think there are *no rules* In the market.
