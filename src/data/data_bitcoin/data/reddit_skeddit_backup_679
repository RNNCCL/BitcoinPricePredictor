All you have done is shift it to a select few.  The poor will still be poor.\n\n> Anyway, I\'m not an expert, I\'m just some guy who\'s fucking fed up.\n\nOf what?  How have banks hurt you?  How much in fees have you really paid?  Or are you just reciting rhetoric?  ': 3, "In fairness you probably hold the minimum amount in your bank each month to avoid fees.

I would love to see a process similar to buying prepaid gift cards at grocery stores and convenience stores, or if they become a point of sale merchant themselves. \n\nAs a store of wealth, a lot of things performed poorly this past year. I got into BTC in the $200's, so this is still all gravy. Though the amount I invested won't get me rich, I just spend some here and there whenever the price jumps up. I even couldn't care less if the price remains stagnant - it's more the option to cut out banks from buying things because I can save money on the transaction. Everything adds up. Over the past 5 years, BTC has been an insanely good investment - so it's all about perspective. Also, I know this is lame, but 1 BTC still = 1 BTC, so it's still there, just relative to other currencies it went down, and with any investment there's risk. This is just like digital gold speculating. Plus, all currencies have volatility. If you're a trader you dream for this type of action.\n\nHypothetically if we woke up tomorrow and Bitcoin is the new world currency there will be a shift in wealth yes, but if people converted their fiat to BTC then over time it would gain value because of the fixed amount of coins versus money being overprinted and inflation running rampant.

Will they have access to the basic necessities at least cost?  Will healthcare cost less?  Will food cost less?  Explain to me how the poor suddenly stop becoming poorer in this new system?  \n\nLet\'s think about it this way.  Joe has 1 bitcoin.  He\'s poor.  Joe lives paycheck to paycheck.  He *needs* to spend that bitcoin *now*.  His kids need to eat, his rent needs to be paid.  Sure, tomorrow it will be worth twice as much but that won\'t do him any good if his kids are dead.  But let say he figures out how to do with only a 0.5 bitcoin, now he\'s richer because that 0.5 spends just like 1, right?  Do you think prices stay the same?  You think that the food and rent he paid 0.5 BTC will still be 0.5 BTC tomorrow?  No.  Those prices will rise too.  \n\n> I also don\'t get why you just want to pick apart everything I try to say?\n\nAre you kidding me?  Seriously?

I had a coworker who grew up communist-era Russia.  Another coworker complained about the US government.  He talked about how the US was a totalitarian regime against its own people.  My russian coworker looked at him and became to rip into him.  She talked about how friends of hers were kidnapped by the government in the middle of the night because they spoke out against Mother Russia.  She talked about trouble makers got sent off to labor camps.  I don\'t think he ever understood her point.  I don\'t think he ever wanted to see her point but hopefully you will.

Trust me, you never want to see it.\n\nEdit: I hit enter too soon.': 1, "Alright fine here we go, \n\nI see Bitcoin as a solution to everyday financial problems. In lamest terms the average person loses a substantial amount of money to the system through user fees - Bitcoin can substantially reduce that loss while still serving the same purpose as a currency or a store of wealth. I would love to save more money by the end of the year. I'd be doing that if the majority of my transactions were done with BTC, I mean who wouldn't?\n\nIf you think that the average Joe won't care, then you're wrong. People care about their money, banks fees alone are enough to get people riled up. Imagine if your employer suddenly gave you the option to be paid in BTC, that would be sweet - imagine if you could go one step further and just cut the bank right out for your everyday transactions. Just think of how much money you'd save. Everything is always about money and if you find a relatively simple way to save people money I arguable say that the majority would logically give it a try. \n\nYou're right about the cultish attitude, I can't help that - I just get too excited. \n\nI guess saying that Bitcoin is inevitable might be a bit extreme, but in reality the system that we have now is creating a huge divide financially between people.

There\'s a lot of work to be done. I give it until 2018-2020 until the next big step and BTC is ready for the general public. Soon there will be thousands of BTC ATM\'s with very competitive fees and almost exchange level pricing. Big players will hold more BTC and the price will rise very slowly as adoption occurs. That is what we want. No bubbles or panics.

The solution to what?': 1, "It depends on your economic outlook, but did you also take into account that the world's economy is in a wreck and central banks all over the world have digged themselves a big hole by restrucuring the whole economy to zero % interest rates?\n\n They have to be lifted some day leaving the economy in ashes.\n\nThere will come a moment there is a choice between a hefty deflationary collapse or runaway inflation.": 1, '"inevitable" in the context of the rest of your post seems to be in regards to mass adoption of bitcoin by the global public. There are any number of reasons why this is not inevitable. It isn\'t impossible, but I think the window for it to actually happen is getting smaller by the day. As it stands now, the actual consumer uptake of bitcoin seems to be stalling, if not going backwards. If this doesn\'t change before the VC starts drying up, I don\'t think it is going to happen at all.\n\nThere are some things that bitcoin has arguably been successful at, namely gambling and as a means of transacting on illicit markets, but that wasn\'t what you were getting at.': 0, "Not sure why you are here day after day posting negatively on every high visibility thread - it certainly isn't to provide anything useful to the world.\n\nHearing about something is far, far different from looking into moving money into something. \n\nThere are only 650,000 bitcoin addresses with any meaningful value and you are telling me that globally there aren't enough people to drive the next price surge? I have at least four addresses myself in cold storage so realistically bitcoin is held by a very tiny number of people. But you have decided that everyone who is going to consider bitcoin has already bought it. Why? Because the price has slumped as it has after every single price surge the fledgeling currency has experienced before now. How stupid are you?\n\nSilicon valley has pumped in nearly half a billion dollars of funding into bitcoin companies (not the currency) in the last year alone. You think these people do not know the current userspace in bitcoin? That is quite a lot of money to invest for a payment rail used actively by less than a million people globally.\n\nMicrosoft, Dell, Expedia, Newegg have publically adopted bitcoin purchases via BitPay - deliberately associating their brand with the brand of bitcoin in the process. Paypal is integrating it into it's systems. Why would Microsoft or Dell bother when the actual income from bitcoin users is likely to be a speck on their balance sheets for the year? Why take the risk?\n\nHint: the recent price weakness tells you absolutely nothing about where bitcoin is going to be in a year or the potential the currency has to disrupt the global payments and asset industries.\n\nI'll leave you with a final point. If an ETF is approved which holds bitcoin then that will open the floodgates for a multi-trillion dollar capital pool to trickle slowly into bitcoin. A capital pool currently excluded from buying bitcoin in a tax efficient manner. \n": 1, '> If we assume that there are 500,000 users of Bitcoin globally (likely over estimate) then it is extremely easy to see where growth will come from.  As the currency gains utility and visibility across the Internet adoption will follow (see wallet users, transaction statistics). Not being able to see another 1 to 10 million people buying into Bitcoin in the next (manufactured) mania is myopic to say the least. \n\nThat\'s like saying if everyone in America donated $1 to me, I\'d be rich.  So far only 10 people donated, so the potential for me to be rich is huge.  It makes no sense.  Last media hype got bitcoin (by your own admission) under 500,000 global users.  Even though hundreds of millions of people have heard of bitcoin it has gotten under a million users...\n\n> Bitcoin already has several \'killer apps\'. For business it eliminates a significant % of transaction costs - a no brainer. \n\nThese "free" transactions come at the price of inflation of the currency at staggering rates.  Last numbers I saw each transaction was socialized by everyone to the tune of $10 or more per transaction (on top of each transaction omitting 104 pounds of CO2 into the atmosphere, an amount that is simply MIND BLOWING, considering 25% of all transactions are completely fake to begin with).  Additionally, these free transactions won\'t last forever, and may even be implemented at the next halving.  Even if they aren\'t implemented then, it\'s a certainty they will be implemented within the next 1-2 decades simply because most of the coins will be mined.\n\n> For the end user it allows the use of sound mathematically scarce money and will increasingly operate as a store of value.\n\nBuzzwords.

You don\'t hear about all the other thousands who either never brought it up, or who talked about Bitcoin or gave some as gifts in a very tactful and appropriate manner (appropriate recipient), etc.\n\nAlso, tangentially; I\'m very skeptical of a lot of the claims of "crazy" talk, especially when coming from those who are known to contribute to /r/buttcoin or who are otherwise persistently negative towards Bitcoin and bitcoiners.  From my experience; what they often call "crazy", is in fact very well-reasoned and/or fact-based assertions.  I see far more posts decrying or complaining about the "crazy" and how extreme /r/bitcoin has gotten, than I see of these actual crazy posts and threads.

However, I really don\'t believe the extremism to be as much a problem as a lot of people here (and outside the bitcoin community) make it out to be.  I think that there\'s a feedback loop of everyone saying that the community is full of crazy, and a popular bandwagon to jump on there; and combine that with the fact that the very idea of Bitcoin, (not to mention the well-reasoned economic and political ideas which many bitcoiners hold) are difficult to understand, and express (especially to the non-technical and the old), and are often counter-intuitive and certainly go against the status quo in many ways.  If the bitcoin experiment (not to mention much of history) teaches us anything, it\'s that very sane and very important ideas are usually taken as very crazy by the mainstream at the time.  Their perception is what holds them back far more so than our methods or message.\n\nI for one believe that we should always strive to enhance our methods of communication and try to explain things to people as best we can; but we can\'t blame ourselves too much (nor let other people dissuade us from or blame us) for coming off as "crazy" to a lot of people.

That completely eliminates the possibility that a jury may decide "Meh, we aren\'t enforcing *that* law today".\n\nRegardless, as it currently stands, *legally by precedent jurisprudence*, whether you like it or not, juries in the U.S. do have the power to decide law.  So when you say this:\n\n>Juries are not empowered to determine what is wrong and what is right.\n\n...you are wrong.  They actually *are*.   They have done it numerous times, like you pointed out, in fact.  So precedent disagrees with you.  And there is no statute overriding that precedent.  So sorry, but you\'re wrong.\n\nI understand you\'d like reality to be different, and that\'s fine, but that\'s not how reality currently is.  If you walk into a jury, and you decide to acquit someone who did indeed do what he was accused of, that\'s okay, your verdict will hold, and you won\'t be arrested.\n\nTherefore, de facto and de iure, you have the power to do that which you say cans be done.': 1, 'Ok, so how can knowing the law and its implications be an argument to reject somebody?': 2, 'Thanks.

Those jurors probably thought they knew what the law should be too.\n\nJuries are not empowered to determine what is wrong and what is right. They are only finders of fact. They evaluate the evidence and decide whether it meets the criteria specified by law. *Not* whatever they personally think the law should be.\n\nIf you don't like the law there are legislative avenues to have it changed. Juries are not supposed to let their emotions or desires influence their decision. Jury nullification sounds romantic and allows you fight your own little battle against the man, but really it's a slippery slope.\n\nYou've already made up your mind as to whether the accused is guilty or innocent without seeing any evidence. That's one small step away from vigilantism if you ask me.": 3, 'This is one of the most obscene elements to the judicial system today.\n\nJury nullification is a right of the people as a safe guard against laws without public support. The supreme court has ruled on this and the founding fathers made their views clear.\n\nDespite jury nullification being a right of the people, the courts and judges have ruled:\n\n1) The defense is not allowed to inform a jury of this right.\n\n2) The prosecution and judge can misinform and tell jurors nullification is illegal (and they commonly do)\n\n3) Will kick off any juror who says they might use nullification\n\n4) Will kick off any juror who other jurors say they believe is using nullification (so any jury can kick off a "not guilty" holdout by falsely saying that juror is using nullification)\n\n5) Bar the public for informing a jury about nullification (this is why the Ross effort has to take place over a few weeks, it is to protect the pamphlet distributors because otherwise they could be arrested for targeting the Ross case).\n\nFundamental rights are only rights if they are known by the public, if education of a right is denied by a government then the right ceases to exist.

Only thing I'm worried about is how high the risk is, I couldn't calculate it since i'm new to this area. How high is the risk actually? My worst case scenario would be that my rig breaks down early and if it breaks; it isn't really a big loss for me. Does the risk overwhelm the profit?": 1, "I don't really know how big the risk is but I can tell you I don't think long-term this will be worth a lot of income.  Let's try to take this complex system and simplify it a bit.  \n\nLet's call your cost to buy the unit $X.  If you assume price and difficulty stay constant, your electricity remains free and your unit doesn't break each day past 113 will net you $X/113.  I could be wrong but I think that breaks down to 0.88% profit each day all factors remain constant.\n\nIf the difficulty double halfway to day 113, let's say day 57, you end up with another 112 days to break even.  And that's if it stays the same.  Does it mean it'll increase by 100%?  Probably not.  Let's say 10% - you go from 56 days to 62 days.  What if halfway through that it increases 10%?  31 days becomes 34 days.  Your initial 113 day break even is now 153 days, and your profit after day 153 is more like 0.65% per day.\n\nIf the difficulty decrease halfway through, it's just the opposite effect.  You end up with a quicker break even and more profit after the fact.  \n\nPrior to December, there hasn't been a drop in difficulty since before 2013 [source](https://bitcoinwisdom.com/bitcoin/difficulty).  Is it likely to continue to drop?  Maybe.  It might drop a bit more but I don't see it going much lower personally.\n\nWe haven't even begun to talk about price yet.  Bitcoin seems to be staying in the 300-350 range.  Could it do another massive jump?  Maybe.  If it does it's a double edged sword.  Not only will you be able to sell for more, but people will crank up the mining.  More profit to be had means more mining to be done.  If it goes down, the difficulty might go down.\n\nFinally, I'd look at the rig you're looking at.  Are people happy with them?  What's the mean time before failure?  What happens if it breaks?  Will the company replace it quickly and if not, will they replace it with something better?\n\nIn the end, only you can decide what risk you can absorb.  I'm not familiar with your finances and what you have put away if thinks go bleak.  You *might* make some money with it but the odds are not in your favor however fortune does favor the bold.  \n\nWill it be a long-term money printing machine?  No.  It'll die long before that or fall back in processing power sooner than later.
