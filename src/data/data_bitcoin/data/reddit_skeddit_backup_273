Fees can be < 1 satoshi, just not trustless settling below that amount. You could do 1,000 transactions that result in a single satoshi fee which is then settled in the end.

Is it a static fee, or is it dynamic? Is it user-controllable?\n\nFees will be dynamic in that they\'ll be different for different channels, and adjustable without having to close channels. They\'ll probably have a rate limit though -- ie, you can only change your fee every 10s or every 10m or every hour or something.\n\nIt will be user-controllable, in the sense that you can choose not to forward transactions that don\'t pay enough fee, or you can choose for your transaction to only pay a particular fee and if that\'s not enough to have it fail (and be refunded, obviously).\n\nI expect it to be a percentage fee (since forwarding a transaction has an impact on your channels proportional to how large the transaction amount is), rather than a per-kB or per-tx fee like the blockchain has. If the percentage for an individual hop is 0.1% (eg), and there are five hops, then that\'s 0.5% total, so sending more than 20 mBTC (about $5 USD) to someone over lightning would give you total lightning fees of more than 0.1 mBTC and it would be cheaper to go via the blockchain. (Cheaper lightning fees and shorter routes would raise that 20 mBTC figure; longer routes and higher fees would lower it)\n\n> The LN summary document states: "Lightning enables one to send funds down to 0.00000001 bitcoin without custodial risk" -- this implies a user can send as little as 1 satoshi to another user, which confuses me because it would imply there is no fee (or is the fee less than 1 satoshi?).\n\nRusty\'s adjusted the resolution to operate in 1/1000th of a satoshi; so a 0.1% fee on a 1 satoshi transaction would work fine. (These get rounded off when you hit the blockchain though; so you want to have done thousands or millions of microtransactions to get any benefit) cf http://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/lightning-dev/2015-September/000218.html\n\n> How does a future transition to the LN affect Bitcoin miners compensation (specifically their compensation from \'miner fee\', which will become a bigger concern as time goes on and coinbase reward decreases)?\n\nI don\'t think there\'s anything special here -- lightning nodes rely on the blockchain so will have to pay whatever it costs to keep the blockchain running, just like anyone else using bitcoin. If it turns out everyone uses lightning for everything because bitcoin tx fees are high, then lightning nodes will be the only ones paying fees and compensating miners, and they\'ll have to pay high fees to get high security. If lots of other people are paying fees, and there\'s competition for space due to block size, they\'ll have to pay high tx fees just to get in a block. Same as anyone else using bitcoin without the inflation subsidy.\n\nIf blockchain fees were really high at say 12.5 mBTC per tx (so 2000*512B txs per 1MB block pay 25 BTC matching today\'s per block inflation subsidy), and lightning fees were really low at 0.1% for the entire route, then sending 12.5 BTC or more (about $3000 USD at current prices) would be the point at which it\'s still cheaper to use the blockchain directly. So I don\'t think it\'s plausible to ever expect to see everything happening over the lightning network.\n\n(Also, lightning only really supports payments to an address; if you want to use bitcoin\'s scripting features, you still have to use bitcoin... That\'s why lightning\'s running on bitcoin, after all)\n\n> What are the system requirements to run a LN node? The graphic used in the summary document implies smartphones and laptops will be equally able to run a node. Is this true?\n\nI don\'t think a smartphone would be practical (you\'d lose connectivity too often, you\'d run out your battery life, and you don\'t have enough control of the OS to protect it from being hacked), but afaics it would definitely be possible. (The difference between being a node versus running a "light" lightning wallet on your phone is probably more in how you use it than how the actual software works)\n\n> Is running a LN node incentivized? I seem to recall that users running a LN node will be paid a \'LN fee\' for any transaction their node helps relay.\n\nYes, you collect a fee for every transaction you forward.\n\n> Assuming there is a monetary incentive, what are your thoughts and the team\'s thoughts on fixing the lack of incentive to run a Bitcoin full node, by introducing a clear financial incentive for LN nodes? I was thinking this could be done by integrating LN nodes with Bitcoin full nodes, thereby incentivizing Bitcoin full nodes and LN nodes via a LN fee.\n\nI\'m not part of "the team" (whatever that means), I\'m just following the list and reading the code now and then, but I don\'t think this makes sense -- running a lightning node means putting bitcoin into channels and keeping the keys you\'d use to spend those bitcoin available, which means the bitcoin could be stolen if someone cracks into your computer. I think the way it will work out is the more you risk the more profit you\'ll make; so if you\'re not willing to risk very much, you won\'t get much profit.\n\nHowever, if you\'ve got cheap and easy micropayments, you could just add fees for some bitcoin RPC operations -- "you\'d like me to forward a transaction? sure, 1 satoshi please", "you\'d like to see blocks 100,000 to 100,999? that\'s another 1 satoshi", "you\'d like a proof that tx X hasn\'t been spent yet? sure 1 satoshi". Maybe that way full nodes talking to each other would break even, but they\'d all get subsidised by payments from lightweight wallets?\n\n> Has there been any thought given, as to short-term and long-term implications of requiring bitcoins to be locked to perform LN transactions? If a portion of the money supply is locked, what positive or negative effects would it have? How can the negative effects (if any) be resolved?\n\nAssuming OP_CSV, the money isn\'t locked for any extended period (ie it\'s locked up for a day not weeks, and it\'s not locked up at all if both sides of the channel are active), so I don\'t think there\'s much effect. You could equally well say that at present there can be at most, what, 10k input transactions per block, and since the UTXO set is about 33M, so on average any given satoshi is already locked for about 10 days (since it would take 33M/10k*10min ~= 20 days to spend them all).\n\n> There is a focus on micropayments with LN, but it seems that with all the benefits offered by LN, many users will have the urge to perform larger transactions too. How does the user know the max amount of bitcoins able to be transacted over LN?\n\nAs a result of coping with fees as low as 1/1000th of a satoshi, a single lightning transaction can only be about $10, so there\'s one limit (though you can just use multiple transactions to send larger amounts, of course). Otherwise, if you spend too much money in one direction, the channels on your routes will be lop-sided, and either fees will rise until you stop doing that, or the channels simply won\'t be able to accept your transaction anymore. And, as above, at some point, using the blockchain directly will be cheaper anyway.\n\n> If there is an issue conducting a LN transaction (if a node is unresponsive or absconds from its duties), then what is the minimum, typical, and maximum amount of time the user\'s funds will be in limbo? Do funds simply return to the user\'s LN address? Does the user have any control over the process? Does the user get notified when an issue occurs?\n\nUnknown at this point. Hopefully the normal case will be that you know within seconds or tenths of a second. The worst case is that a node goes down while forwarding your funds, in which case your funds for that transaction get locked up for a timeout period (many hours or a few days). It may be possible for the merchant to "cancel" that payment despite that timeout (the dead node can be routed around), so that you can safely retry the transaction.': 1, "Okay then, I will ask the various parties mentioned and see if they're willing.

Relating to #1, is a user\'s Lightning address static or does it change? Is the address private, in the sense that unlike Bitcoin addresses, a user can share just one LN address and still maintain privacy (is a LN address functionally a stealth address)? -- Is it possible to open a channel (in order to join the LN), then use your LN address to transact with anyone else who also has a LN address? If everyone just has a LN address, then what reason is there to ever close a channel (since it costs a miner fee)? If someone has coins in a LN address, then suddenly there is an attack on Bitcoin (a fork occurs, etc.), what happens to those coins -- do they sit safe in the LN address, or is it recommended for that reason to regularly settle the coins onto a BTC address? Is it possible for a LN address to send bitcoins to someone else\'s Bitcoin address (and route via LN), and vice versa? \n\n3. Can you detail efforts to make LN routing private, so that LN nodes aren\'t able to keep a record of user transactions? I\'ve heard of encrypting transactions; perhaps, the onion routing model puts this into practice. But can you explain it, and describe what benefits (and vulnerabilities, if any) exist? Is there any threat of LN nodes spying? Can LN nodes track IP addresses, or identify origin/destination? What happens if a malicious actor controls many LN nodes: would this make spying easier (the way it works in Tor with bad actors controlling exit nodes)?\n\n4. What kind of fee is expected, in order to be able to transact on the LN? Is it a static fee, or is it dynamic? Is it user-controllable?

How does a future transition to the LN affect Bitcoin miners compensation (specifically their compensation from \'miner fee\', which will become a bigger concern as time goes on and coinbase reward decreases)? Any ideas on this issue, as it relates to LN or even generally speaking? From what I understand, variables that affect this situation are: 1) bitcoin\'s exchange rate (the higher the price, the more each miner fee and coinbase reward is worth), 2) volume of on-chain transactions (the more transactions, the more miner fees).\n\n6.

I seem to recall that users running a LN node will be paid a \'LN fee\' for any transaction their node helps relay.

Assuming there *is* a monetary incentive, what are your thoughts and the team\'s thoughts on fixing the lack of incentive to run a Bitcoin full node, by introducing a clear financial incentive for LN nodes? I was thinking this could be done by integrating LN nodes with Bitcoin full nodes, thereby incentivizing Bitcoin full nodes and LN nodes via a LN fee. This would avoid a more messy approach to introduce a "Bitcoin node fee" (similar to "miner fee") to force every on-chain transaction to contribute a small fee that is paid out to Bitcoin full nodes. I am taking inspiration from r/JoinMarket, in this respect, as that project uses the incentive of a monetary benefit to successfully encourage people to lock bitcoins to allow people to CoinJoin with them. (LN seems like a similar situation of locking bitcoins to allow LN transactions to occur)\n\n10.

As originally presented, access to LN for most users would've been under a hub-and-spoke model. Hubs in such a model would've been largely responsible for routing. Now talk has shifted to a decentralized routing model, and this just posted today: https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3n89cu/lightning_network_onion_routing_proposal/  \nI'm not sure if this would be a complete decentralized solution including URIs or DNS-like capability, though.  \n\n* I believe this will hinge on which routing system becomes most popular, and how it handles privacy.  \n\n* No, LN transactions are effectively instant, and *mostly* trustless (funds can get tied up for predetermined periods of time).  \n\nPersonally, I learned a lot watching the presentation from the SF Bitcoin Devs Seminar:  \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zVzw912wPo": 1, 'Yes, please set this up!': 3, 'Compare with /r/joinmarket fees, which have already dropped to levels that annualize to low single digits.': 2, "Yes, that would be very helpful!

However, I see 100% use as unlikely, as large transactions should be made on-chain anyway, as LN is not well suited for that. There will still be bitcoin transactions, it's just you'll be able to make many transactions and net-settle your micropayments.\n\n> [can you do manual route selection]\n\nYes, you can do whatever route you want (even dummy routes/transactions going in a circle back to yourself), selection will have the option of being fully source routed. There may be groups of nodes which do frequent transactions with each other, they will of course route directly amongst each other by default. Of course, more exotic routes may require custom software, the other nodes will be able to follow the route requests, though.": 3, ">Do you have to have bitcoin to open a lightning network connect? I.e. can someone open a channel with 0 btc and still receive microfund payments?\n\nYou can open a channel to receive bitcoin on the lightning network without putting in bitcoin. In order to send on the network, you need some amount of bitcoin to open a payment channel. It can however, be fairly small.\n\n>How are wallets envisaged to work with this?

I run an online store and accept LN payments, would I just post up my bitcoin address with a prefix of lightningnetwork: or something?\n\nIt will have an address system, we're still working on the specifics.

I mean, I don\'t see any downsides to using LN. Why wait 60 min, if I can wait 1 second or a few seconds?

Some users may want more centralized systems and it\'s impossible to stop them (similar to how some people use hosted wallets), but the system is designed to be open access and as decentralized as possible by default.\n': 8, 'http://dreamatico.com/data_images/beach/beach-8.jpg\n\nRelax, we got this, the beach is on its way too.': 4, '> Relating to #1, is a user\'s Lightning address static or does it change? ... If everyone just has a LN address, then what reason is there to ever close a channel (since it costs a miner fee)?\n\nI think it\'s an open question as to how static lightning addresses will be. In order to change them you have to change your channels, so that\'s a cost, but maybe the benefit of decoupling payments makes it worthwhile? But onion routing means that your address isn\'t that tightly associated with the payments you receive, so maybe it\'s not that worthwhile?\n\nIf you\'re making a profit in the lightning network (either by collecting lightning fees, or being a merchant), you\'ll fill your channels up and the obvious way out is to close and reopen them. If you\'ve established a few channels, and some are much more profitable than others, you\'ll want to close the unprofitable ones to free up the bitcoin in those channels. Also, if the channel\'s quite profitable and you want to make it bigger, you\'ll need to go to the blockchain and effectively close and reopen it.\n\n(It\'s also likely that you\'ll need to keep a few hundred bytes of info for every transaction you\'ve ever had go across your channel in order to protect yourself against cheating -- eventually that will add up to enough to make it worth paying a few cents to miners to commit to the blockchain and refresh the channel. But that\'s months or years)\n\n> If someone has coins in a LN address, then suddenly there is an attack on Bitcoin (a fork occurs, etc.), what happens to those coins\n\nThe lightning channel is backed by an anchor transaction that\'s published on the blockchain when the channel opens; as long as the anchor transaction itself isn\'t forked out of the blockchain and its inputs doublespent, you should be fine.\n\n> Can you detail efforts to make LN routing private, so that LN nodes aren\'t able to keep a record of user transactions? I\'ve heard of encrypting transactions; perhaps, the onion routing model puts this into practice.\n\nTo send a payment you first choose a route, ie "to get to Dave I send to Alice, who sends to Bob, who sends to Carol, who sends to Dave". Dave chooses an R value, and sends you its hash (#R) somehow. You then "onion route" the payment to Dave ending up with a message MA encrypted for Alice. This way:\n\n - Alice sees something from you, paying to R, and decodes MA to see it is to be forwarded to Bob with a message MB\n - Bob sees something from Alice, paying to R, and decodes MB to see it is to be forwarded to Carol with a message MC\n - Carol sees something from Bob, paying to R, and decodes MC to see it is to be forwarded to Dave with a message MD\n - Dave sees something from Carol, paying to R, and decodes MD to see it is for him; he reveals R to Carol to receive the payment\n - Carol sees R, and reveals R to Bob, to receive the payment from Bob\n - Bob sees R, and reveals R to Alice, to receive the payment from Alice\n - Alice sees R, and reveals R to me, to receive the payment from me\n\nPrivacy features: if you\'re not in the route, you never see the transaction; if you are in the route, you only know your neighbours are involved, you don\'t know where it came from or where it\'s going; *but* if people in the route collude, they can correlate a transaction (Alice and Carol can see the same #R in the transaction, so can now it came through me and went out through Dave -- this is quite a bit worse than timing attacks with tor, but unfortunately seems unavoidable)\n\nYou know your neighbour\'s lightning addresses, and you have a connection open to them over IP (or similar), though that itself might be anonymised over tor.': 1, 'Short Answer: There are no answers yet.

It could remain a niche currency for a long time (adoption increasing only very slowly), or, probably due to some failing government and its inflating fiat currency or bail-ins, bitcoin adoption could occur quickly and suddenly (to protect one\'s wealth). It seems to be occurring to some extent in Argentina and Venezuela: in Argentina because people are very tech-minded and educated and there is inflation so they choose bitcoin to protect wealth, and in Venezuela perhaps because electricity is subsidized and cheap (so bitcoin mining becomes a way to generate money) and inflation is deteriorating their wealth.\n\nSupporting the Venezuela idea, bitcoin.org is ranked 2,197 in Venezuela (http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/bitcoin.org), which is the highest rank out of the top 5 countries that represent most demand for visiting bitcoin.org. This means Venezuela, per capita, may be one of the highest sources of bitcoin demand.

That goes a long way to building confidence in an institution \xe2\x80\x93 particularly a new one based on a digital currency that itself is only six years old.\n\nBut the Winklevoss twins also believe Gemini has features that will make it more appealing to institutional traders.\n\n"We describe Gemini as an E-Trade, because we\'ll have a web interface, like Nasdaq, because we have a matching engine order book, and like DTC [Depository Trust Company] because we are also a clearing and settlement house. We are basically all three functions collapsed into one," Tyler Winklevoss told Modern Trader. "When we discuss what we\'re doing with the institutional crowd, they get really excited about the clearing and settlement aspects of what we\'re doing, and the reduction in costs. Bringing that friction down is a massive opportunity."\n\nThe Gemini Bitcoin exchange also fits into a larger trend of rapidly increasing Wall Street interest in the digital currency. Last month, for instance, nine major world banks announced they had formed a partnership to study ways to incorporate Bitcoin into the global financial markets, an alliance that since has grown to 22.\n\nThe Gemini exchange is just one Bitcoin investing initiative the Winklevoss twins have undertaken.\n\nThey also are awaiting U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approval of the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust, a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) that will trade under the ticker Nasdaq: COIN. Approval of the Winklevoss Bitcoin ETF is expected before the end of the year.\n\nThe Winklevoss twins also created their own Bitcoin price index, the Winkdex, which uses a weighted formula based on trading at the top three Bitcoin exchanges.\n\nBut for now, they\'re very much focused on launching the Gemini Bitcoin exchange.\n\n"Our days are focused on building what we consider a pure-play Bitcoin exchange," Tyler Winklevoss told Modern Trader. "We need to make sure it\'s an active, healthy market with the right participants, so that when people show up, there\'s liquidity, a full order book and everything works as expected and advertised.

So if our first users will be from one social network they could easily to communicate with each other using what they use to use every day! Moreover, we are going to integrate with twitter deeply, so some users probably would be able to use a service without leaving a twitter.\n\nThe third is trust. The service was coined as a medium of economic expression. But people usually trust more if you can proof some trust. That is the most simple and not annoying way to proof some trust.\n\nWill a Twitter login live forever? Sure not!

Both sides can lock up some money and the total amount that's locked up is redivided between the two parties as payments are made.\n\nThis automatically means that neither party can have a higher balance than the total amount locked up in the channel. That means that you can have the unusual situation that a payment fails not because the sender doesn't have enough money, but because the recipient has too much.\n\nIf you have 5BTC and want to be able to receive another 5BTC through a certain counterparty then you'll need to ask your counterparty to lock up another 5BTC for you.

Some number of bitcoin were locked up when those five channels (AB, BC, CD, DE, EF) were established, and each channel\'s locked bitcoin is split between the two ends; so if AB had 2 BTC, A might currently have 1.5 BTC while B has 0.5 BTC; likewise if BC had 3 BTC, B might have 2 BTC while C has 1 BTC.\n\nWhen the 5 mBTC transaction starts, A locks up 5 mBTC on the AB channel that B can claim later; and B does likewise on BC, as do C, D and E on CD, DE and EF respectively, though presumably F will claim the funds pretty much instantly, so whether anything\'s "locked" on the EF channel is debtable. So that adds up to 25 mBTC across the channels, to make the 5 mBTC worth of funds. If this is happen simultaneously on 5 different 5-hop routes, that\'s 125 mBTC worth of locked funds.\n\nIn the normal case, that\'s not really interesting though -- they\'re only locked for the second or two the transaction takes to complete, and it only affects people doing things simultaneously. \n\nIf you\'ve got a peak of 1M transactions per second (compared to Visa at <100k/s), an average route length of 5 hops, and an average transaction takes 5 seconds (which I think is all fairly high); but you have 100k nodes, each with an average of 10 channels, then the average channel is only doing ~50 simultaneous transactions -- and with each transaction at under 0.04 BTC that\'s only 2 BTC locked on each channel.\n\nI think the bigger constraint is the initial channel funding (where you\'re locking bitcoin into the lightning network while the channel is open) -- ie, the 1.5+0.5 BTC that A and B put into the AB channel in the first place. If you want to pay $10/day ($5 for coffee, $2 for bus fare, $3 for internet), but only recharge once a month, your channel ends up being $310 (for the monthly figure) rather than $10 for a day; and there\'s similar constraints for merchants (if you get $5 for each coffee that\'s great, but if you want your channel to last for an entire day\'s sales of 400 coffees, it has to have $2000 worth of capacity).

Because it did yesterday. And why did it have value yesterday? Because it did the day before. And so on and so forth, until this begs the question: why did this currency *first* had value?\n\nIn the case of gold, it has value because it **does** have excellent non monetary properties. It is a great electrical conductor, it is extremely malleable, extremely ductile, extremely non reactive. Those are some of its non monetary properties. Besides, it is usually considered aesthetically pleasing. So, it is the fact that gold is useful as something other than money that gave it initial value; and then, because it also has good monetary properties (e.g. fungibility, value density), it was adopted as currency.\n\nBitcoin has much less useful non-monetary properties (because that's not what it was designed for).
