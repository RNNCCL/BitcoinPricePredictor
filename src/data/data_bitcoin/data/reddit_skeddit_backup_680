And great discussion! \n\nWe at BitGive do offer much of what the video is covering and much of what you're discussing in the comments here. We are working on a few POS options we hope to have ready in 2015.\n\nWe are a 501 (c)(3) nonprofit, so you can get a tax deduction (if you wish).  To do so, you use the form so that a receipt can be generated (for IRS purposes, our name, your name, and the BTC amount needs to be on the receipt if you're writing it off). You can also donate **anonymously** through the QR code or static wallet address - http://bitgivefoundation.org/donate-now/ \n\nWe also run campaigns for NGOs that don't accept BTC, and right now we are running one for Medic Mobile - http://bitgivefoundation.org/medic-mobile-campaign/ \n\nDonations to the Medic Mobile campaign are also tax deductible and if you wish to do them **anonymously** you can by using the form and **only entering the BTC amount** *(there isn't a QR code or wallet address, because our payment service provider has stopped offering those for new accounts)*.\n  \nWe have a separate sign up for Members, Founding Donors, and our newsletter where we do ask for at least a name and an email address, but these are optional programs and there are other ways to donate to us as I mentioned above. \n\nIf you are interested in the tax deduction, donations have to be made before the end of the calendar year to count towards your 2014 taxes and you need a receipt.  \n\nWe have partnered with LibraTax and they have developed software where you can calculate your taxable gains (based on how long you've had the coins and their value when you purchased/received them) and you can also calculate how much you could donate to offset those gains, thereby reducing (or even eliminating) your due taxes.  \n\nHere is LibraTax's Blog on this topic - http://www.libratax.com/blog/digital-currency-donations-good-society-good-personal-finances/\n\nAlso a great article came out yesterday in Forbes about this - http://www.forbes.com/sites/janetnovack/2014/12/22/how-to-donate-bitcoin-to-charity-and-get-a-big-tax-deduction/\n\nThanks and Happy Bitcoin Holidays Everyone!!\n\nConnie Gallippi,\nBitGive Founder and Executive Director": 3, '"a long time ago" wasn\'t actually an incredibly long time ago in my corner of the universe I guess..

Don\'t use bitpay or anything from any of the ID3 group (yes I mirrored it before it was censored and yes I\'ll post it later when it\'s not this year so too bad if you are from windhover / ID3)': 2, '+100000 Charitable donation IS NOT AN INVITE to SPAMMING!!!': 1, "Is it time for all charities to accept bitcoin? Not if they are using it merely for deductions.. it doesn't make sense just to get out of taxes or to claim it as some kind of writeoff or something or on the other hand to have a clarification for tax purpose or (shudder)... interpretation of it by a corporation-state as income? (Regardless of what any country does, it's a slippery downhill slope, and technological communities of the world have no interest in giving North Koreas, Russian Federations, or La USAs of the world their combined resources ~ so let's move right along.)  We need to move in a different direction as communities.  However, many charities can accept bitcoins (or many other decentralized virtual currencies) independent of tax forms (not that this content provided here suggested tax forms should be used - it didn't - but there seems to be a huge emphasis this time of year on taxes and tax forms).\n\nFull disclosure, I'm a Candidate for Individual Director for Bitcoin Foundation.\n\nOn the other hand, why not examine how charities can simply accept bitcoins and manage them?  And on the one hand there are associations, and on the other there are nonprofits which should surely consult with their lawyer -- nonprofits that have a lot to lose from losing potentially a legal status should certainly consult their legal eagle.\n\nBut individuals and associations which are curious about receiving donations or just routing what has been given to them, to others, should simply do so, without being concerned at all about regulation. In fact such a method has been set up for them to do exacty that:\n\n\nAs I've looked into this a bit more it occurs to me that there are various layers to this. I'll address them as simply as I can with basic instructions that you can use.\n\n1) The case of nonprofits or any business organizations who don't want a bitcoin wallet but would like to be able to accept bitcoin donations\n\nI'm going to suggest for these cases that (BitGive, as an example ~ but really this could be anyone) send various organizations a link to various instructions, which do not require any wallet client.\nAlternately, such organizations that don't want a bitcoin wallet and / or don't want to do any bitcoin setup, might consider allowing themselves to receive donations through an organization such as BitGive so that donations BitGive receives could be disbursed to organizations under BitGive's nonprofit umbrella, or alternately could allow BitGive to set up a charitable campaign for them.\n\n2) In case BitGive (or anyone else) wants a simple, open source point of sale solution, which supports bitcoin payments or standard cards, recurring payments, analytics and so forth:\n\nConsider crowdtilt/open, which has been beta tested.  Includes simple two-line thing for donation button for any Wordpress, personal site, etc.  This can be easily found online.  For developers please be sure and check signatures!  For many small organizations and some large ones, crowdtilt/open may be a very good and simple solution.  But it is not the only one.\n\n3) In case you want donors to be able to take advantage of privacy and tailor the experience specifically to those interested in managing donations ~ more work, but may be better overall experience if you are trying to manage how donations are routed to multiple organizations:\n\nThe following instructions will be useful (note, these are installation instructions, which assume you are running a Linux-based operating system (Ubuntu, other) and minimal knowledge of terminal commands ~ but if these seem confusing, get in-person help from any local coder/developer you may know).  The following provides a method of use of stealth addresses in tandem with a charity donation graphical user interface:\n\n(Note/ Disclosure!: Different wallet systems have different levels of support for stealth addresses - some have no support, others can support it.  Status on different systems is shown here.)\n\n   a. Install 'sx' with shell script.  Link to shell script [here](http://sx.dyne.org/install-sx.sh).\n\n   b. **UPDATED** Instructions for next steps with 'sx' at [this link](https://github.com/spesmilo/sx/tree/version1/tools).\n\n   c. **UPDATED** Note script and charity donations sections [of the instruction](https://github.com/spesmilo/sx/tree/version1/tools).  Include or change organization names, bitcoin addresses, etc. as needed.\n\n   d. QR code generators in this system have installation instructions available [here](https://github.com/spesmilo/sx#qr-code-generator).\n\n   e. For organizations that expect to receive anything more than tiny amounts of bitcoin donations, a multisignature setup should be established *first.*   Info on that [here](https://github.com/spesmilo/sx#multisignature-n-m-transactions), which includes instruction for setting up multisignature in 'sx' as well as how to release (spend) the coins.\n\n\nNote that you can also set up multisignature fairly easily through [Coinkite](http://blog.coinkite.com/post/106063091741/privacy-is-freedom) (consult Rodolfo), create M-of-N multisignature through some kind of multisignature escrow.\n\n   Regarding  http://coinb.in ~ https://github.com/OutCast3k/coinbin/\n   New as of Dec. 1, 2014, http://coinb.in has the following features:\n    Multisig address generation now supports compressed public keys.\n    Transactions and redeem scripts will return more information when they're decoded, including the N-of-M number and the    \n    amount of times they've been signed.\n    Better transaction builder. You can build transactions from regular addresses as well as multisig addresses.\n    Improved signing function. Regular transactions as well as multisig transactions can be signed.\n    You can generate compressed and uncompressed public keys.\n    Private keys are given a password field by default with option to show them later.\n    You can generate addresses from Brain wallets.\n    A built in browser based wallet, with access to your own private keys!\n   \n\nPlease feel free to share these instructions / recommendations with anyone you see fit to share and collaborate with.... but please also if you are the one actually developing this, please check signatures with those who actually published the code and exchange communication via valid gpg to be sure.  Design is not always easy, that's for sure - it may be straightforward, but confirmation that you have what you need requires some time to get the communication right and I recommend in-depth commitment to gpg communication via gpg e-mail.\n\nHope this helps ~ Cheers,": 2, 'I love how you referred to this as "the drift."

In particular, starting Feb/2014 both charts shows a shifted exponential decay, tending towards the pre-bubble price. \n\nStarting 2014-05-20, Bitcoin had a mini-bubble that lifted the price from ~450$ to ~650$; but, by the end of Jul/2014, the decaying trend resumed.  Another even smaller bubble around 2014-11-20 lifted the price from ~320$ to ~370$, but again the decay resumed soon afterwards.\n\nLitecoin did not have these two mini-bubbles, so its price continued to decay by the same trend, unbroken since February.  It price now (~22 CNY) is already close to the level of Oct/2013 (~15 CNY)\n\nMy reading is that the dominant process was the same for both coins, namely the Chinese speculators have been gradually selling their holdings and leaving the market.  That would be the cause of the overal decaying trend.  In my view, that decay happened all year long for Bitcoin too, but was masked during the mini-bubbles.  In other words, the Bitcin chart is the Litecoin chart with those two mini-bubbles added.\n\nThe second mini-bubble (2014-11-20) may have been caused by the comment by an OKCoin staff member that "a 3 billion euro fund with start trading on our platform".  I still have no idea of what could have caused the 2014-05-20  mini-bubble.\n\nIf there is no new development, the BTC price should keep decreasing but slowly, tending to the Oct/2013 level (~130$) plus whatever effect remains of the two mini-bubbles (+200$ and +70$).

It was the year when Bitcoin first gained mainstream exposure beyond the occasional "lol ponzi tulips" article. Venture capital funding started flowing in slowly, as did merchant adoption but this huge run-up in price is mostly being attributed to speculation and possibly some shenanigans at Mt.Gox the then biggest online exchange.\n\nSo BTC enters 2014 in a vastly overbought state with Mt.Gox apparently deeper and deeper in problems. China starts banning Bitcoin every other week, people panic sell and the price tumbles. \n\nIn February 2014 Mt.Gox finally implodes, taking about half a billion USD worth of BTC with it. The daily candle for February 25th is a red cross marking its death.

Many proclaimed this to be a new level of stability from which the rocket to the moon could be launched.\n\nThe rocket was launched in Late May with some spectacular buying but in the end it turned out to be another dead cat bounce with selling pressure overwhelming demand and causing a crash to yet a lower low.\n\nUpon making that low we had the bearwhale incident which inspired many people to yet again proclaim the bottom of the bear market. We will probably see soon whether they\'ve been right or not.\n\nMeanwhile the important news of 2014 is that the surrounding infrastructure of services and merchants kept growing at an accelerating pace to catch up with the inflated expectations of the 2013 price run-up. Maybe 2015 will be more balanced in this regard for a change :)\n\nToday most coins are being mined by professional operations which presumably sell most of them for fiat in order to recover their investment and cover their operating expenses.

Those type people can drown out people trying to provide a more complete picture of getting involved with Bitcoin.
