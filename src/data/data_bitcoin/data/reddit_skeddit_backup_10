He just doesn\'t understand Bitcoin or money very well.\n\nI tried to leave a comment on his video to help him understand but it doesn\'t appear to have posted. Maybe there\'s a length limit?\n\nI tried to write:\n\n---\n\nSome of my responses to your video, ordered by time:\n\n> 0:01 "the newest revolutionary currency"\n\nWell, it\'s been around for 7 years already. It\'s not very new any more.\n\n> 0:14 "it\'s totally anonymous"\n\nAnyone telling you that doesn\'t know what they\'re talking about. The entire blockchain is public, so all transactions are public. Maybe they meant to say it\'s pseudonymous, meaning that it\'s hard to tie transactions to real identities.\n\n> 0:21 "it just doesn\'t make sense to me"\n\nDo you have any specific questions about it? Maybe I can help explain it.\n\n> 0:33 "the crash is the reason I don\'t think any businesses are ever going to adopt it"\n\nLots of businesses already adopted it. The price of Bitcoin is going to remain volatile for a long time yet. If it is ever widely used the price will need to be much higher than it currently is. 7 years ago the price was zero. You can\'t go from zero to "lots" without some bumps along the way. It\'s too volatile for most people to consider it an investment right now. Those who are brave enough to take a risk could make a very good return. And those who don\'t like the volatility should probably stay away for now.\n\n> 0:44 "Why would you buy a currency when it could lose its value in a matter of days"\n\nPersonally, I bought some Bitcoin when I first heard about it because the tech itself is amazing. Never before has there been any way of individuals holding money that they can spend on the Internet without requiring the permission of a third party. I can send money from my Bitcoin address to yours and nobody can stop me. Nobody can shut my account down (like PayPal tend to do) or tell me that I\'m not allowed to send money to you (because you\'re suspected of some crime or other). Those coins that I bought for 40 cents each are now worth over $400 each. That\'s a 1000x increase. Of course I didn\'t know the price was going to go up. It could have gone down to almost nothing over the next few months, but it didn\'t. I took a risk on Bitcoin after looking at the code and working to understand how it works. Once I saw how it works, how it\'s so robust against attack, I figured it was worth putting some money into. So the $25 I risked is now worth $25k. You can say I gambled and got lucky, but it seemed like a good idea to me at the time.\n\n> 0:55 Businesses accepting Bitcoin are subject to price fluctuations\n\nMost Businesses that accept Bitcoin use a payment processor that allows them to convert any percentage of the Bitcoins they receive into their own local government currency. So if they want US dollars, that\'s what they get. The price in Bitcoin is calculated using the spot price right then, so the company gets exactly the right amount of dollars. There\'s no risk to the business if they don\'t want any Bitcoin price exposure.\n\n> 1:05 Why would you accept a Bitcoin when you could accept a dollar that will still be worth a dollar next year?\n\nWell, the purchasing power of the dollar is steadily decreasing. A dollar today has 5% of the purchasing power of a dollar 100 years ago. New dollars are being created at ever increasing speeds. A Bitcoin I earned 5 years ago is still worth 1 Bitcoin. Only now instead of being able to buy a pizza with it, today I can buy a chainsaw with it. Its purchasing power has gone up. That\'s why I accept Bitcoin rather than dollars whenever possible.\n\n> 1:11 Inflation happens to everyone else as well, so it doesn\'t affect you as much\n\nThat\'s not true. When I was a kid I could buy a chocolate bar for 20 cents. Now the same thing costs me a dollar. I can buy 5 times less chocolate with my dollars than I used to be able to. The fact that you can also buy less chocolate than you used to be able to is no consolation to me. The inflation has reduced my purchasing power whether or not it also affected yours. If you\'re living paycheck to paycheck then I guess inflation isn\'t a problem, so long as your salary keeps up with inflation. But what if you\'re trying to save for the future? Inflation eats away at your savings, so you\'re betting off just buying all the chocolate you can afford each day.\n\n> 1:30 You\'re gambling by holding Bitcoin\n\nTrue. But you\'re also gambling by holding any other asset. Government currencies go up and down relative to each other. In the last couple of years the Canadian dollar has lost around 25% of its value relative to the American dollar. Would you say that people with their savings denominated in Canadian dollars were "gambling"? Most sure don\'t feel like it, yet they\'ve still "lost". Holding Government currencies is a losing proposition long term. They always end up worthless. So what are you going to put your money into that isn\'t a gamble? The stock market? That\'s a gamble too. Precious metals? They also go up and down in price. Whatever you pick you can\'t be sure that you\'re going to maintain your purchasing power. It just so happens that over the last 2 years my Bitcoin assets have performed better than my Canadian dollar assets. It could have been the other way around too, but there\'s no way of knowing in advance. Diversification is key.\n\n> 1:45 What happens when there are no more Bitcoins to mine?\n\nThat doesn\'t happen for over 100 years, so it\'s not an immediate concern. But the block reward does halve every 4 years. In addition to the 25 (soon to be 12.5) Bitcoins per block, miners also get all the transaction fees for the transactions they include in a block. The idea is that transaction fees will replace the block reward in incentivizing miners to keep on mining.\n\n> 1:50 What if mining becomes so expensive that nobody does it any more\n\nWell, the difficulty of mining is automatically adjusted by the Bitcoin protocol such that there is just the right amount of mining going on. If some miners stop mining, blocks will start taking too long to be found, and so the difficulty will automatically be adjusted to make it easier for the remaining miners, reducing their price per block. Your concern reminds me of the joke "nobody goes there any more because it\'s too busy".\n\n> 2:00 Doge is such stupid\n\nYou\'ll get no argument from me there.\n\n> 2:38 Nobody cares about Bitcoin except for people who like its anonymity of decentralization properties.\n\nI care about it because it gives me back control over my money. It can store it as securely as I like, I can spend it however I like, and I don\'t have to trust any third party to store it or to help me transact in it. Decentralization is important in that it makes that control possible. If Bitcoin was run from a centralized server then it would be trivial for governments to shut it down; it would have a single point of failure.\n\n> 2:45 Why would you use anything other than a government controlled currency?\n\nBecause the government controlled currency is constantly being inflated, robbing savers of their value. Because government controlled currency can\'t be sent instantly over the Internet without permission of a third party. Because I can.\n\n> 2:48 I don\'t even care.\n\nThen why make a video about it?\n\n> 2:52 People going crazy about Bitcoin\n\nI\'m not going crazy about it. I\'ve worked for Bitcoin, I hold some, and I use it regularly when I need to buy things online. The massive historical price increases have been a nice bonus but I would be using it even if they hadn\'t happened.': 1}, ('Swiss City to Accept Bitcoin Payments for Government Services', 4): {}, ('Christian Decker: Duplex Micropayment Channels - Zurich Meetup', 31): {'TL;DW anybody?

All of these improvements have taken huge amounts of time and extensive testing before they can be rolled out into a live network.
