Arbitrary caps on block size will undoubtedly limit its usefulness and increase its cost, thereby reducing innovation, especially versus alternative blockchains that don't impose such arbitrary limits.   For the pro-limit camp, lower innovation is a small price to pay to achieve maximum decentralization.  \n\nThose who are opposed to arbitrary limits, like me, value number three ahead of number two, at least to a point.  We see tart the greatest threat to Bitcoin is some competitor that does everyone that Bitcion does, only better, and the a lot more to boot. We agree that we can't sacrifice decentralization for innovation completely, and I would never want to do so, built we can (and in my opinion should) sacrifice a little bit of decentralization now for much higher rates of innovation in the near future.  \n\nIn our view, the decentralizion issue can be solved in the future via a variety of means, not the least of which is that a rising bitcoin price (that results almost invariably from our favored innovation) will surely attract more miners and operators of full nodes.  Should the price rise high enough, nation states will no doubt compete among themselves to ensure that each has within its borders, and subject to its jurisdiction, a sufficient number of core nodes to guarantee that its enemies, or even allies, can never control the network.  It's not hard to imagine nation states even subsidizing the bandwidth needed, or even the energy costs, so that a reasonable worldwide balance of full nodes is achieved over time.  Ultimately, Bitcoin may end the nation state as we know it, but not before they sign their own death warrant via an economic arms race that supports and enables it.  \n\nBut none of that will happen without sufficient innovation and development, which won't happen if arbitrary limits are imposed upon the the protocol.

Raising the blocksize to keep transaction costs low is like (poor metaphor) putting a windmill on your car to generate electricity while driving. Yes, the people getting to use that electricity benefit from it (people who send a high # of small value, low-priority transactions from spv-like clients benefit the most from no fees), but the car will use extra gas because of wind resistance. (everyone running a fully-validating node will need more bandwidth) To me it\'s as simple as that, and I (respectfully) still don\'t see the point of shoving exponential bandwith requirements down the throat of those who want to be 100% secure and private by running a full node, just so some other people don\'t have to pay a tiny fee that goes to the miners, who fundamentally are the only ones actually securing the network.': -4, '> If, once that is accomplished, then the community agrees there is unreasonable fee pressure\n\nThis implies that fee pressure has been building during the process of garnering more users.

The primary elements of Bitcoin that users should focus on are the "addresses" and "private keys". Even "public keys" are only secondary in importance for general users. There really is no such thing as a "public address" (or a "private address" for that matter) in the Bitcoin protocol.': 1, 'There\'s a few things to understand in order to answer that.\n\nThe first is what a hash is.  The short version is that it\'s a function that returns a value of a specific length.  So whether the input is "Hi" or "Hello" or "This is an even longer piece of data", the hash function will return the same length of output, and that output will always be the same size, and the output will always be the same for a given input.  The other aspect of a hash function is that it is "one way".  It is very easy to put input into the hash function and get output, but it\'s basically impossible to get some hash output and determine from that what the input was.  The hash is considered broken and unusable if you are able to do that.  The only way to map hash outputs to inputs is to just churn through inputs and outputs and record them in a lookup table.  And hackers do that - they\'re called rainbow tables.  That\'s why websites often add "salt" to something before they hash it.  That "salt" is simply a small bit of extra arbitrary random data to add in, so that rainbow tables won\'t work.  For example, your poor password "password1" is in a rainbow table, but if the site adds random letters like "x$Q7fG" and takes the hash of "x$Q7fGpassword1", that\'s probably not already in a rainbow table.\n\nThe next thing to know is about public and private keys.  Whether it\'s elliptic curves or RSA, the general idea is the same.  You have a "private key" from which you can derive your public key.  People can encrypt things to your public key, and if they do so, then only your private key can decrypt them.  So you can publish your public key publicly, and people can then encrypt messages that can only be unlocked with your private key.  A second feature of private/public keys is digital signatures.  A signature is something that can only be created by your private key, but which your public key can be used to verify that the signature indeed must have been created with your private key.  So I can use my private key to "sign" a PDF document for example, and if you have my public key and the document and the signature text, you can verify that indeed I made that signature for that document, and I made it with my private key.  The signature proves I own the private key, even though it doesn\'t reveal the private key to you or anybody else.\n\nThe most common way to send bitcoins is to an address, which is a hash of a Bitcoin public key.  The reason we do it that way is so that if there is a vulnerability in elliptic curves, your money can still be safe, since the public key isn\'t even known until you spend the money, only the hash is known.  The public key is revealed only when you spend money, because it is necessary to prove that the digital signature came from your private key.  And the way Bitcoin verifies that the transaction is valid is it checks the signature with the public key (and the data being signed is not a PDF but the Bitcoin transaction itself), and the Bitcoin miners and users verify that the private key indeed did make that signature (and make it for this transaction), and then they also verify that the public key hash is the same hash as the output transaction.  If those two things are true - the signature is good and the hash matches - then the transaction is valid and the money can be spent.\n\nThe reason Bitcoin uses the hash in addition to the public key is security.  Let\'s say elliptic curves suffered a flaw that allowed somebody to derive a private key from a public key in 3 hours, but the hash functions were still unbroken.  Then your money would be safe the vast majority of the time, because you could spend it and get the transaction mined before somebody looking at that transaction (which shows your signature and your public key) would be able to use your public key to reverse engineer your private key.  And your public key wouldn\'t even be revealed until you spent the money, so as long as the hash function was still safe, you\'re mostly ok.\n\nSo it\'s a fail-safe backup.  In an emergency where the elliptic curves or the hash function get broken, users still have an emergency backup way of keeping their money temporarily safe while the Bitcoin software gets updated.  This is why a lot of people always say you should not re-use addresses, because if you\'ve spent from an address previously, then its public key is already publicly known, and you lose that emergency backup protection.\n\nSo now that we\'ve got all that explained, I can actually answer your question!  An address is the hash of the public key.  So when you have a private key, you can use that to derive the public key, which you can use to derive the address/hash.  That\'s why you only need the private key backed up, because everything else can be derived from that.\n\nWhen you hear about compressed/uncompressed, that has to do with a feature of the Bitcoin elliptic curve math.  Basically, the public key is actually a point on a graph derived from the private key.  It\'s just an X and Y coordinate.  However, the Bitcoin curve has a neat property that any X coordinate can only ever have one of two Y coordinates, and the Y coordinates can be derived from the X coordinate.  (The Bitcoin curve is "Y\\^2 = X\\^3 + 7".  That simple.  So you can see how every positive X value can have a positive or negative Y value, because of the Y-squared part.)\n\nSo sometimes you\'ll see a public key written as "04" followed by the 64-character X value, followed by the 64-character Y value.  That\'s an uncompressed public key.  But you may also see just the X value with either an "02" in front or an "03" in front of it, indicating which of the two Y values is supposed to be used if you uncompressed it.  So a compressed or uncompressed *address* is just saying that the address is the hash of either a longer 04 public key or of the shorter 02/03 public key.  Remember, hashes output the same length, so the length of the address will be exactly the same, and in fact you won\'t know whether it\'s a compressed or uncompressed address until you see the spending transaction that shows the public key.': 35, 'You can derive a Bitcoin address from the public key.': 2, "Public keys are a low-level primitive in the Bitcoin protocol, are (despite their name) actually *private information* and shouldn't ever be exposed to end users.

They\'re just called "addresses."\n\n>From the technical papers I\'ve read, it seems that you hash a public key to get your address.\n\nThat\'s true.\n\nAddresses add features you don\'t get with a public key.\n\nFor starters, there is a checksum built into every address. Mistype or transpose a character, and it can be detected - before you (or your payer) send money down a hole.\n\nSecond, addresses avoid characters that are easily confused with each other through compact base 58 encoding. Hex doesn\'t have this problem, but results in very long representations.\n\nAlso, giving a hash of your public key offers a security advantage. If elliptic curve cryptography starts to succcumb to attacks in which a private key can be extracted from a public key (discrete log problem), using a public key hash forces the attacker to perform yet another difficult step of generating the public key from the hash. The added security only applies if you haven\'t reused  addresses. Spending from an address publishes the corresponding public key to the block chain.\n\nSome have speculated that Satoshi didn\'t know about public key compression at the time addresses were created. Uncompressed public keys are 65 bytes long, whereas the hash value Bitcoin uses is only 20 bytes long. From that perspective, using a hash leads to a more compact identifier.

The total number of atomic unts was limited to 2^51 for software engineering reasons, and the parameters of the block reward schedule (initial reward and halving period) were chosen so as to put half the coins out in four years.  \n\nHowever, implicit in that choice was the assumption that the price (and usage) would not grow much faster than that.  Assuming the value of the coins at the time was proportional to the cost of creating them, the price at the time should have been less than 1 cent.  Then today the price should have been only twice as much, or still only a few cents.  \n\nIf the price had remained at those levels, clients would maybe see mining as a handy alternative to buying the bitcoins that they needed; but the total block reward given out to all miners would be a couple hundred dollars per day at most.  That would not be sufficient to justified acquiring equipment just for mining bitcoins, not even a powerful GPU card.\n\nUnfortnately, speculation (with some help from the drug trade) pushed the price up by a factor of ~10 every year,  instead of doubling every 4 years.  That made mining into an industry that, in spite of the recent drop, still collects 1 million dollars per day.  \n\nActual usage also grew, but not as fast, and now it is still insufficient to justify the cost of mining.   The estimates of 8 USD per transaction, or 2% on transaction value, are still too modest, because they assume that all the 120\'000 tx and 50 M USD that move every day on the blockchain are actual payments.  But there is evidence that maybe 90% of it is either housekeeping (people moving their coins between their wallets, for any of many reasons) or "frivolous" uses like gambling, that would not exist if transactions were not nearly free.  Even the hypothetical 10% that are "payments" -- coins changing owner in exchange for goods or services -- probably include many payments that are done in bitcoin only for ideological reasons, not because it is objectively the best choice.\n\nIf those factors are taken into account, the cost of the network comes out as more than 80 USD per payment, or more than 20% of the value paid.  So there is no way that the current mining industry can be paid by the users who benefit from it.  Not even close.\n\n> The average user won\'t want to pay a transaction fee much higher than 4 cents\n\nCompared to other payment methods, bitcoin has very few advantages, and many disadvantages.  It will never replace cash, credit cards, PayPal, bank wires, etc.. (And it was not meant to; it says so even in Satoshi\'s paper.)  Its usage will be limited to those cases where its unique features are necessary, or save a lot of money, and override its risk and inconvenience.  (The lack of a charge-back mechanism is a disadvantage, not an advantage, for most legal commerce.)  For those uses, any fee under 1.00 USD or 1% of the value may be acceptable.  However, at present levels of usage, that may be only 1% of the  revenue that the mining industry collects from block rewards.  \n\nTo be economically sound and sustainable, the price of bitcoin should drop to single digit or less; which will mean the collapse of the mining industry and a 99% drop in the hash rate.  Obviously, that "solution" will never be adopted voluntarily by the community.': 3, '"to keep miner compensation at roughly 25.1 bitcoin" \n\nWhy should miner compensation be kept at 25 bitcoin?

The block reward has induced people to invest in mining.\n\nThen again, what *is* the correct hashrate? If the hashrate falls too much, an adversary with very deep pockets could potentially make attacks against the network; how are you going to get users of Bitcoin to fork over the money required to build up defenses in the form of more honest hash power? Assuming people won't voluntarily increase their transaction fees, a tax in the form of a block reward is at least the easiest way, as proved by the extensive resources that have already been thrown into mining due to it.": 1, "1000 times lower price isn't single digits it's a fractional value, that would put the market cap at 4 million instead of 4 billion \n\nMining doesn't cost $80 per transaction, it's only through some twisted backwards logic that would also have to count inflation dollars into every fiat transaction.

There are 24 x 60 = 1440 minutes in one day, therefore 144 blocks are mined per day, on average. \n\nThe miners get 25 BTC for each block that they mine.  That is 3600 BTC per day.\n\nThat is their reward for the service of confirming transactions. About [120'000 transactions are confirmed each day](https://blockchain.info/charts/n-transactions?showDataPoints=false&timespan=180days&show_header=true&daysAverageString=7&scale=0).  Dividing 3600 by 120'000 gives 0.03 BTC per transaction.  At 275 USD per BTC, that is 8.25 USD.  \n\nOr if you prefer, the transactions in the blockchain now move each day [200'000 BTC](https://blockchain.info/charts/estimated-transaction-volume?showDataPoints=false&timespan=&show_header=true&daysAverageString=7&scale=0), worth [55 million USD](https://blockchain.info/charts/estimated-transaction-volume-usd?timespan=2year&showDataPoints=false&daysAverageString=7&show_header=true&scale=0).  Dividing by 120'000, it means that each transaction moves 1.67 BTC, or 460 USD, on average.  Thus, that 8.25 USD that the miners get per transaction is about 2% of the value moved by it.\n\nCurrently, the miners get that money by selling the BTC that they mine to people who are investing in BTC.  If the miners had to be paid by the people who issue transactions (who are the only who benefit from the miners' work), those people would have to pay a flat fee of 8.25 USD per transaction, or 2% on the transaction's output amount, or some combination of them.  \n\nThat, assuming that all those 120'000 transactions per day would continue to be issued once those fees start to be charged.

The difference is the former 0.005 BTC was when BTC was 10$ (so the fee is roughly 5\xc2\xa2) where the latter 0.0001 BTC is when BTC is 300$ (so the fee is 3\xc2\xa2). Besides, transaction fees are generally 0.1 BTC added to the coinbase. Over the period of a day, that's roughly 14.4 BTC split to all miners. \n\nLater in BTC's lifetime, say 20 years, we will have seen an additional estimated 5 block reward halvings. This would put the reward at 0.8 BTC and (assuming perfect economics) would put BTC at 8960 USD (280*2^5). We would probably see fees accounting for way more than 0.1 BTC. At 0.0001 BTC we see 0.1 BTC so roughly 1000 fees (1000 transactions of 0.0001 BTC per block). 20 years later, we may see as much as 30-40x the daily transactions and at 8960 USD/BTC we would need a fee of 0.000005 BTC to equate to 0.05\xc2\xa2. 0.000005 BTC *(30,000-40,000) = 0.15 BTC to 0.2 BTC (but now the value of the fees is 1300-1800 USD worth). But of course, most people believe that 8960 USD/BTC is actually attainable in the next 10 years, so it's possible that the value of BTC can be upwards of 20,000 USD/BTC (if it truly succeeds) and the fees can actually account for 2500-4000 USD of the block rewards.\n\nOn another note, however, miners don't need a substantial reward for their efforts, especially when other backbones such as nodes are run for *free* and receive *nothing* in return.": 1, "> Mining doesn't cost $80 per transaction\n\nOf course not.

But as soon as that first big block gets mined the miner has to decide -- what will bring a greater return: newly mined bitcoins (BTCs) from the side where the 1MB limit is still enforced or newly mined Bitcoin-XT coins (BTXs) from the side where big blocks are allowed.\n\nIf the market wants the BTCs at a higher price than they want the BTXs, then that\'s where the mining capacity will go (or revert to).\n\nSo the real question that needs to be asked is ... how will BTCs be priced compared to BTXs. \n\nGenerally, the market will tell us if we listen.

The oil that Iran traded for gold was priced in DOLLARS, not in ounces of gold.

The historical precedent is that we need exactly that.  This is well discussed and explained in 20 years of lectures by John Nash.  We cannot ignore such economics. \n\nNO other coin can provide this.  Bitcoin is first, and bitcoin cannot be changed.  Alts can do many many things, but they cannot be the basis for all of this.

They were very reluctant to concede this at first, but most have been forced to do so stating, for example, that "bitcoin shouldn\'t be used to buy a coffee" or for micropayments or for trivial non-monetary transactions of little value or import. \n\nHaving conceded this, they nonetheless insist that this limitation is nothing to be concerned about.  They argue that even if bitcoin won\'t be used for such things, it can still be useful, and valuable, when used ONLY as a settlement currency for large value transactions. \n\nMike Hearn responded to this argument by pointing out that history knows no such thing as a currency used ONLY to settle high value transactions.

Gold was used to settle large transactions historically only because it was used to settle most EVERY transaction (both large and small) historically (for instance, during the gold standard).  Since the end of the gold standard, when gold ceased to be an accepted means of settlement for all transactions (large and small), gold has not, contrary to your unfounded and undocumented assertions, continued to be used as an acceptable means of regularly settling large transactions (absent duress). Do we see occasional instances of barter with gold?  Of course. As we do with oil and wheat and war planes and any number of other goods/commodities.  But we don\'t consider these other goods/commodities to be a general purpose "settlement currency for large transactions", nor does their value derive from their use ONLY as such. Neither is/does gold. And neither can Bitcoin survive as such. \n\nIf Bitcoin doesn\'t handle the small financial transactions and the non-monetary uses for a blockchain, some other blockchain will.  And a blockchain capable of handling a great many small things will quickly grow to be capable of handling large ones.  Quite simply, due to network effects and other causes, there is no reason to believe that Bitcoin can succeed as a limited purpose blockchain dedicated only or primarily to settling large transactions. It must do more than that, much more, or something else better will.

The brute-force-attacker hence needs 196 tries to brute-force your wallet.\n\n----\n\nNow to the single-sig wallet:\n\nHere we assume that the password is constructed as a character sequence "A-B" (the "-" is an explicit character), where A and B are each character strings of size 1 to 3, containing characters 0 or 1 only. So the password can for example be equal to "11-0" or "001-101".\n\nLet\'s further assume that the attacker knows a-priori that the password is constructed according to above principle.\n\nQ2.: Now, how many "checks" does the attacker have to do to crack this single-sig wallet?\n\nA.2: Well, each sub-password, the first (A) and the second (B), can have 2+4+8 = 14 possibilities:\n\n- 2 possibilities of 1 character, namely 0 or 1.\n\n- 4 possibilities of 2 characters, namely 00, 01, 10 or 11.\n\n- 8 possibilities of 3 characters, from 000 to 111\n\nSo, for the whole password, which consists of a combination of two sub-passwords separated by a "-" character, there are 14 x 14 = 196 possibilities. The brute-force-attacker hence needs 196 tries to brute-force your single-sig wallet.\n\nThat\'s the same as the multi-sig wallet.\n\nFinal note: My example shows that I even made a comparison in favour of the multi-sig wallet, because I assume that the attacker of the single-sig wallet knowas a-prior that the separator character between the sub-passwords is a "-". In practice, he would not know this and had to check also for <space>, <comma>, <comma space> and other typical characters.\n\nThis means that in practice, your Bitcoins are even BETTER protected in a single-sig wallet when you construct it according to the scheme "passw1-passw1-passw3-...-passw7".\n\nAs said, all this assumes that one check of multi-sig wallet takes the same CPU time as one check of single-sig wallet.
