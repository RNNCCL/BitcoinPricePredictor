All investment is about the purchase and sale of risk.  Let me walk you through my logic of why selling now to buy back later is a very reasonable idea:\n\nSuppose for simplicity that bitcoin is now at $300. (I know it\'s not, this is just to make the math easy). Also to keep the math easy let\'s say I own 100 coins. Furthermore I believe (read: "have a hunch") that it will reach $150 before it reaches $600. \n\nNow let\'s say that I decide to sell all my coins, and then commit myself to buy at either $150 or $600, whichever comes first.  That\'s my strategy.  In the long run, I\'ll hold coin, but in the short term I\'ll be divested.  Two things can happen:\n\n**Scenario A:**  I sell my 100 coins for $30,000.  I wait until it reaches $150.  I buy back 200 coins.  At that point I\'ve doubled my bitcoin holdings, and I own $30,000 of them.\n\n**Scenario B:**  I sell my 100 coins for $30,000.  I wait until it reaches $600.  I buy back 50 coins.  At that point I\'ve halved my bitcoin holdings, and I own $30,000 of them.\n\nNow you may say, "Hey, you don\'t have a crystal ball, you don\'t know which of those scenarios will really play out."  Right you are.  But here\'s the clincher: I don\'t even have to be right more than 50% of the time.  \n\nEven if these two scenarios are *equally* likely, then it makes mathematical sense to sell now and wait.  My EV for expected number of bitcoins in the future is 0.5 * 50 + 0.5 * 200 = 125.  That\'s 25 more bitcoins than I own today.\n\nEven if I am wrong a little *more* than 50% of the time, it *still* make sense to do it.\n\nAnd the icing on the cake is it\'s even better than that, because while my money is tied up in bitcoin it accrues no interest.  When my money is in dollars I can grow it as time goes by, as I wait for Btc price to reach one of my targets. The longer it takes to reach a target price, the better for me.\n\nThe only flaw in my logic that I can see is the assertion that those two scenarios are nowhere close to equally likely, that scenario B is far and away the most probable.

The use of HMAC-SHA512 during key derivation breaks any mathematical connection between child keys because its output is indistinguishable from random. Even if an attacker has two or more sibling private keys, it's not possible to work out any additional siblings or the parent without bruteforcing a 256-bit keyspace.\n\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinSerious/comments/25dhts/linking_bip32_addresses_created_by_same_master_key/\n\nIf the attacker knows the parent public key, things get a little more interesting. As /u/cipher_gnome already said, an extended public key (xpub) plus a child private key reveals the extended private key, and the entire branch is compromised.\n\n> Completely separate from HD keys, re-using keypairs can make it easier to determine a public key. \n\nI'm guessing you mean private key? And you're talking about the problem where multiple signatures from the same address combined with a bad RNG can reveal the private key i.e. duplicate *r* values in the signatures. Which is what just happened to blockchain.info. HD wallets minimise this vulnerability because multiple signatures for the same address should never exist in the first place unless you receive multiple transactions to a single receiving address. \n\nBut if you throw in knowledge of the xpub then things get messy again. If there are duplicate *r* values in two signatures, **even if they're for different addresses**, and the attacker knows the xpub, then the entire branch is compromised.\n\nLuckily this whole *r* value problem is easily solved by using deterministic signatures - [RFC6979](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6979) - and all BIP32 wallets that I'm aware of are already using it.": 3, "Thank you, that's exactly the language i needed to read it in to understand better.\n\nI was referring to multiple signatures from the same address and a bad RNG.

Does knowing 1, 5, 20 or N affect my ability to ascertain the MPK or any other key?\n\nI was linked below and it appears the answer is no - there is no known security issue.": 1, 'so each "parent" key can have two kinds of "child" keys.  a normal key and a "hardened" key.  in a chain of normal child keys, knowledge of the master parent public key as well as *any* child private key can reveal the master parent private key (and all normal child private keys then too obv).  however, in a "hardened" child chain, the private key leak is stopped at the hardened child, so the master parent isn\'t compromised, just the normal children below that hardened child.\n\nso for example, we\'ll have a chain of "m/2/4/6/8/10" and let\'s call "m" the master parent key.  if the private key for 8 is known and the master parent public key is known, then all the keys are compromised, because you can derive all the way up to the parent key.  but if the chain had been "m/2/4/6h/8/10, and 8 got compromised, there wouldn\'t be a problem, because 6h is a "hardened" six, so the master key is safe.\n\nthe reason they don\'t just have ALL child keys be "hardened" by default is that you can\'t derive hardened addresses from parent public keys, only from parent private keys.  so if im a corporation and i want to give each section head a child key to use as a "master" key, i want to be able to watch all of those child addresses, and have other people watch them as well, without giving away the private key.  so i give them the parent master key, from which they can derive the child keys.  but if the child keys were "hard", then they couldn\'t derive those "hardened" child keys with just the master public key, so they couldn\'t watch the address.\n\nso hardened keys stop the private key leak issue, but they also prevent watch lists of public keys.  i personally like the security and don\'t care about public key watch lists, so my chains always start with hardened keys.\n\nthe way in which keys are hardened or not hardened has to do with how the child keys are derived.  normal child keys are basically a hash of adding the parent key and the chain code, so you can verify that the child key belongs to the parent, and that the chain code is correct, and verify all the way up.  (that key adding process is why the private key can compromise all the private keys above it.)  however, hardened keys use a hash of the parent\'s *private* key, so you can only verify that the child is correct if you have the parent private key.  that\'s why a master parent public key cannot derive a hardened child key.': 2, 'Ahhh because the extended PK is used to generate those child keys?\n\nSo you would still be left with brute forcing 2^128 keypairs just like it was a normal ECDSA key?

[The scipy implementation does](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-0.14.0/reference/generated/scipy.stats.chisquare.html) take this into account.\n\nThe test statistic is asymptotically chi-square-distributed; apparently the distribution approaches from below, so for finite samples the p-value is biased to be lower i.e. the test errs on the conservative side.\n\nRegarding individual rolls vs aggregating, I think you figured it out, but the aggregates are sufficient because the rolls are assumed to be i.i.d.; given the aggregate counts, each permutation of the individual rolls has equal probability - there's no further information that can be gained from them about the underlying multinomial distribution.\n\n": 1, "Happy to answer.\n\n1) Yes this is at the crux of the methodology known as 'hypothesis testing', and what you've described is, in the field of statistics, known as 'Type I error' (Type II is the converse - classifying the die as fair when it is in fact unfair).\n\nThe way this is typically handled, is to restrict the probability of Type I error to a level you're comfortable with. For example, typical values are 1% or 5% - you might have heard the phrase 'significance level of 99%'; this is what it's referring to.\n\nOnce you've chosen the significance level, you can choose a certain critical value that, if the test statistic were to exceed, you would reject the null hypothesis - that is, in this case, reject the hypothesis that the die is fair.\n\nSo, we have what is known as a p-value from our chi square test. The statistics of the the p-value tell us that, if this was a truly fair die, the probability of getting a p-value as extreme as the one we observed is on the order of 3.7e-16, or in other words, if we were to choose a critical value for this test that corresponds to this p-value, the probability of Type I error would only be 3.7e-16. So the probability of incorrectly rejecting a fair die is extremely small.\n\n2) The formula for calculating entropy is the same whether the die is fair or not - it's \n\n    H = -sum(p_i * log[p_i] for i in {0,1,2,...,f}) \n\nand p_i is the probability of rolling number i.\n\nThis definition comes from information theory, and in the case of private key generation, is related to the number of possible keys that the attacker will have to test in a brute force attack.\n\n\nEDIT:\n\nTo illustrate point 1) more clearly, see [this graph](http://i.imgur.com/TxtrJ3K.png) for the sampling distribution of the chi-square statistic under the assumption of a fair die (obtained through simulation). The vertical green line, on the other hand, is the statistic obtained from your data - by any measure, one can see that it is pretty much safe to reject the hypothesis of a fair die.\n": 1, '\n\nlog2(possiblities\\^^throws )\n\n256 bits of entropy requires **256** coinflips: [log2\\(2^256\\)](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=log2%282^256%29)\n\n256 bits of entropy requires **99** 6-sided dice rolls: [log2\\(6^99\\)](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=log2%286^99%29)\n\n256 bits of entropy requires **64** 16-sided dice rolls: [log2\\(16^64\\)](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=log2%2816^64%29)\n\nSo to answer your second question, [log2\\(16^1\\)](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=log2%2816^1%29)\n equals 4 bits of entropy for one 16-sided dice roll.\n\n': 1, "I just received a pair of Precision Gaming 16-sided dice yesterday.

When randomness and statistics intersect it always leads to a fascinating conversation. :-) For any finite sequence of rolls, there's always the possibility (for fair dice) that further rolls will occur in such a way as to even out the distribution. Perhaps the question then becomes, how likely is that? I think that's what the chi square test tells us.\n\nAnyways this is pretty much academic, though I do love a good academic talk! It's interesting how there isn't clear consensus as to whether the data points to unfair dice or is just insufficient. I got some different dice that are supposed to be higher quality, and will test them out.": 1, "The sample size is actually big enough.\n\nPerforming a chi-square test for uniform distribution in python:\n\n    from scipy.stats import chisquare\n    counts = [120, 130, 90, 75, 110, 160, 170, 170, 140, 140, 140, 120, 85, 105, 140, 90]\n    stat,pval = chisquare(counts)\n\ngives a p-value of `3.7e-16`, which means that if it was truly uniform, the probability of the distribution being more uneven than this is 3.7e-16. In other words this die is pretty damn far way from being a fair die.\n\nEdit: bonus statistic (and to keep this on-topic) - if the die was fair it would give 4 bits of entropy per roll, so for e.g. to derive a private key with 128 bits of entropy, you would roll 32 times.\n\nAssuming the die was not fair, but instead had a distribution given by Chuck's graph, it would have an entropy of 3.96 bits per roll. So instead of 128 bits of entropy after 32 rolls, you would get 126.7, which is close.\n\n    ": 10, "I have to admit it has been a while since I gave myself a headache over actual statistics, so it's hard for me to respond with as much analysis as you can. I see /u/BobAlison posted a wired article that describes what I meant. It's entirely possible to roll only 1s for 2000 throws and fit randomness of distribution. It would raise my eyebrows, but it would not conclusively prove that the dice are unfair. Your next 2000 dice rolls could be the inverted version of your table and combined make for a normal distribution. I realize that a test makes it seem far away from a normal distribution, but randomness can take a while. \n  \nPerhaps you could run a test on different subsets of your rolls (1st 500, 2nd 500, 3rd 500, 4th 500) to see if those datasets fit eachothers distribution.

The problem is that you are chi-squaring the probability of the deviation of all of the values being that far from their expected value. So you are compounding the p value by applying the AND logic on non-independent events, when you are actually evaluating a single die. i.e. Every 6 that rolls, can't also be an f. Does that make sense?  \n  \nEDIT4: For example, if you flipped a coin 100 times and got 42/58. You can't meaningfully calculate the probability that heads would be 42 AND tails would be 58, unless they were two different coins.

In the last 6 months it\'s fallen 37% and since summer of 2008 it\'s fallen over 55%. I\'d actually argue that Bitcoin as a technology works against Russian interests, even though their criminal sector is obviously doing well because of it. It\'s another scarce commodity to compete with oil.\n\nThere are some quarters of Russia that disagree with what Putin is doing, but unlike here in the US, where we are (rightly) questioning our government after these NSA revelations, Putin is enjoying some popularity with a tenuous majority who want to return to the "Old Guard" and nationalistic pride of Russia.\n\nThe big guys in Russia don\'t give a crap about the rouble because their businesses are in oil or other commodities (In Abramovich\'s case, both oil and aluminium) and a little currency turmoil doesn\'t hurt their bottom line. In turn, Putin and others in gov\'t can put up a little bit with their past transgressions, mostly because, in the end, these guys just want to run their empires and don\'t care as much about the day-to-day politics. Their families are made up of the aforementioned nationalistic citizenry, in fact.\n\nIt\'s kind of ironic that the US changed in such short time to mimic the old spy-on-everything Soviet Union. This is what happens when you do things like declare war on terrorism, though. It\'s a never-ending war, and it eventually sets up your own citizenry and businesses as the victims. Meanwhile, an old enemy has finished licking their wounds from its [1998 default](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1998_Russian_financial_crisis) and is apparently back in full form.\n\nSomewhere along the line, the US and European gov\'ts forgot who the real enemy was. There\'s signs that things have changed, though. You needn\'t look much further than what the US is working on with Iran to end sanctions to see it. I think the solution is to flood the markets with cheap oil to keep Russia in check. Between Iran and China, though, I\'m not entirely sure the US is equipped intelligence-wise to make headway anymore. Too many years of people sitting on their rears checking automated intelligence systems has completely ruined skillsets that used to be superior.\n\nAnyway, so back to Bitcoin and the billionaires, they just have no incentive. What use is Bitcoin to a steel magnate? These guys are already billionaires, they don\'t need to hoard some imaginary currency likely created by a Westerner, especially when their colleagues are stealing and selling it (Russian mafia and/or Russian intelligence).
