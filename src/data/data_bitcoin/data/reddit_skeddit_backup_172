By artificially limiting the number of transactions per block, they are creating artificial scarcity. The fact that this isn't done for technical reasons is a Good Thing. It means that miners are more economically aware of the service that they're providing and charging appropriately for it. If it was for technical reasons, then that would have a distorting effect on the fee market. That's a Bad Thing.\n\n> They would be leaving free money just sitting there in the mempool for the miner of the next block to take.\n\nYup. And that means that the sender of that transaction just had to wait 10 minutes (or more) for his transaction to be mined. If he was in a hurry, he would have paid a little bit more to be included into a block faster, resulting in higher income for whichever miner that decided that that was enough for it to be included in this current block.

It's production cost + profit. The same goes for miners. They made real investments in mining hardware that need to be paid off over time. They need to charge for their services.\n\nBy setting up a tiered payment schedule, they can price their services and create a market that is both profitable for them and gives users a choice.

Assume the value of the block reward + fees in each block is $100. Suppose there are 4 miners of equal hash power. Then they will each spend about $25 per block in an effort to win this $100. To get 50% of the hash power, an attacker needs to spend about $100 per block.\n\nScenario 2: Same $100 reward as above, but assume miners do create negative externalities when they include transactions. Suppose it costs every miner $20 just to process/store/relay all the blocks. Then each miner will be willing to spend $5 on hashing, for a total of $20 spent on hashing across all miners. This means an attacker can spend $40 ($20 to run a full node, and $20 on hashing) to get 50% of the total hash power.\n\nScenario 3: same as above except it costs every miner $24 to process/store/relay blocks. So each miner is willing to spend $1 on hashing, for only $4 of total hashing per block. Now an attacker can spend $28 to get 50% of hash power, and the attacker can get 80% of total hash power if he spends $40.\n\nEssentially, negative externalities from including transactions increase the fixed cost of mining, giving advantages to larger miners, and encouraging miners to 'share' their validation of the blockchain. The effect Charlie describes is real, but we need to actually look at the costs involved to see if it's significant.\n\nAs I describe above, Charlie imagines each tx costing the network 50 cents, but my calculations suggest it's closer to 0.035 cents. If my calculations are more accurate, then a block with 2000 txns in it will cost the network $0.71 cents, compared to $11,250 in block rewards. The total network cost is then 0.006% of the block reward, far too low to create a significant effect like in the examples above. It does not make sense to handicap Bitcoin at this critical growth stage because we're worried about this 71 cents becoming few dollars.": 2, "Good points. \n\n\nProbably not a popular view but... What if the miners scaled too fast. I always pounder that what if they grew to big because they want a bigger slice but just too soon for Bitcoin's I today? I know that I am suggesting we should have a weaker network but maybe to many miners jumped on Bitcoin too soon? \n\nI understand the importance of how raising the block size would create a even worse centralization as bigger miners will out the smaller miners. And that is bad. But what if it's not? What if we are putting Bitcoin to a top floor it was not suppose to be there just yet. I feel like we should open the gate and let the free market readjust itself instead of trying to come up with counter systems to create fake floor. Let the miners fight each other as they were intended. Increase the block size. Let them get more centralized by natural greed and if Bitcoin is worthy it , it would find a way to re correct itself. \n\nI fear that while we are trying to avoid the scenarios we can see heading towards we might be creating obstacles for future scenarios that we can't foresee at this moment. \n\nWhen cpu mining was overtaken by gpu mining , Bitcoin didn't change to correct for that. The free market did. It moved to newer tech to outbid each other. Now we are on the asic area...\n\nWhat we do understand is that once the mining rewards is over. The network will have to survive on transactions fees. Seems like everyone understand that golden rule that will occur then. In today's time though, why must we fear the miners. \n\nMaybe the miners scaled to fast while the user base is still low for them to profit from the current tx fees.

What's certain to me is that a fee market will destroy fast, cheap and unlimited, not to mention the average user's experience.

It is beaten today in the fast/cheap/unlimited categories by a number of competitors.  But I don't think a sacrifice is needed.

He mentions dogecoin's problems, and it was by halving number 4 that dogecoin was anticipating a large drop in hashrate and loss of security, Charlie's suggestion of AuxPoW was implemented with about a month left before that happened.  And he's right that the unrelenting halvings will be catastrophic to miners and to bitcoin without an increase in fee revenue.  That is absolutely essential.

I don\'t agree with this at all.  In a free, competitive market, everyone should tend to optimize for their short term benefit.  Maybe the miners will collude to artificially limit the block size, but that seems like a huge stretch.

The result is that storing one extra tx in both RAM and on disk cost the entire network 0.035 cents (if we assume 5000 nodes like Charlie does). So every 28 transactions costs the entire network one penny to store. Charlie's estimate is **1428 times** higher than mine. If my calculations are correct, then Charlie's insistence that we keep the block size small seems based on his over-weighting the costs of large blocks by over 1000x.\n\nMy calculation considers only disk and RAM storage costs not the verification and relay costs. I doubt those costs would bring my estimate up much more. CPU time is extremely cheap. Bandwidth is the most expensive resource being considered here, but marginal cost of relaying a tx can still be low because of unlimited bandwidth plans. \n\nIf someone wants to make the argument Charlie is making, that the external network costs are so high that it's worth making the network more difficult and expensive to use in its infancy, they should make some effort to justify their numbers.\n\n>The only way to ensure that the transaction fees is enough to pay for the security and decentralization is to have block size limit act as a supply constraint for transactions.\n\nBIP 101 does have a supply constraint.

But in general, whoever is mining the bitcoin owns the miner, so they are essentially renting it to themselves.

A 4TB harddrive today for $100 can store 8 billion 500 byte transactions making the cost to a node $0.0000000125 per transaction.  Then you multiply that number by 5000 (number of nodes) to get close to your estimate of $0.0001 per transaction cost to the network.  Can you expand on this?

It argues that the block size is the only thing that would limit the max number of transactions on the network, which is not true. Soft caps set by miners do the same thing. \n\nAnother factor is time delay. If you pay a low fee, it could take several blocks before your transaction is included. Time is also money. If you want fast confirmations, you pay for it. If not, then you can lower your fee. Currently Bitcoin Core doesn\'t have easy parameters for miners to setup such a tiered inclusion plan. \n\nSecond, the argument that block size is somehow a useful tool to limit transaction volume is wrong. It\'s the most crude and heavy handed method of limiting transaction volume you can think of. It\'s a consensus rule that is extremely difficult to change (even if there is a legitimate reason to do so) and has the nasty possibility of triggering a parabolic rise in transaction fees. \n\nSo I would argue the opposite. For a healthy fee market to develop, the block size should be sufficiently high that it doesn\'t have an effect on it. It should do what it was made for (preventing monster blocks) and nothing else. \n\nI would postulate that a fee market only works if *all* parties are free to act how they see fit. Miners should be able to set the fees they want and so should users. An equilibrium will be found. \n\nTo address a criticism I\'ve heard before, the argument that a "race to the bottom" will be likely, I disagree with that too. Over the long term, miners\' primary income will be fees and the only way they will be able to make a living is to price their services appropriately. Trying to gobble up as many transactions as you can will indeed result in a race to the bottom, but it\'s against a miners own interest to do such a thing, since the following batch of transactions will take that action into account and will thus pay a lower fee, resulting in a lower future income for the miner in question. \n\nBy creating an elastic, time based "artificial scarcity" (one that miners can influence so they can adapt to the market) everyone will be better off. Miners will earn an income and the users will have good security and a network that confirms their transactions.\n\nThis is known as a [Nash equilibrium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nash_equilibrium).

The same miners that are now demanding how bitcoin should be steered into. \n\nI think we should open the gate, increase the block size and not increase the fees ( if it wasn't for the spam attach /dust , I would even suggest to decrease the fees) \n\nLet the miners starve and correct themselves back to the optimal size that they should have been on the first place. \n\nThen who ever wants the get a slice of the rewards would have to join the network with a more serious investment entry point. \n\nIf Bitcoin is worth it , which as more and more time passes it is, than the free market will correct itself back up. And we would have much more tx per seconds, low fees and perhaps even stronger network. \n \nLet's assume what happens if we go bigger blocks tomorrow and lower fees ( assuming we found a better fix for spam/dust)\n\nUnless millions of new users jump in the Bitcoin network and start sending coins, the tx volume will not jump over night so the bigger blocks won't get filled. \n\nThe only problem is that bigger miners can fill blocks and force smaller miners to drop out. \n\nThat's it. Isn't it? The only major concern. That the bigger miners will force smaller miners to close shop? The concern that Chinese miners might be going on their own Blockchain as the outside nodes can't keep up? \n\nAlt coins forking to different block size have shown us a good enough scenario that the Bitcoin block chain won't really behave irrationally. We can assume that the men pool will most likely not create any chaos. \n\nSo basically the main worry are the miners. oh and those who would want the Blockchain to stay small so users can seek out alternative solutions from middle man services. But let's stick with miners. They are the reason we are not pushing for higher blocks. Since we fear they will become more centralized. Which we all agree that they will become more centralized anyways. \n\nSince we will have this problem anyways. Why not push for a bigger gate now and at least build back up from a better block chain? \n\nEdit: of course this is a thought piece and not a demand :)\n\nI know a lot of things go into this but I wanted to rant about miners. The users should have the power. Miners will drop our network security like hot potato if they won't get their roi. So let's think about the users who do the transactions rather then worry to scare off the already oversized miners\n\nAlso I am not blaming the miner for being where they are today. It was an open market and they played the field and grew where they are today(big pools) . I am blaming them for trying to stall Bitcoin progress because they are realizing that their investment in mining equipment, which they invested by themselves out of their own accord will not be suffice to stay ahead any longer. So they are using hostile/masked arguments to stall bitcoin's block chain growth so they can get/continue to get their roi..\n": 3, "> Fees need to be really low until bitcoin is mainstream, which means as prevalent as paypal.\n\nFees need to be appropriate for the services rendered (block inclusion) for the network to become sustainable over time.\n\n>I f fees become comparable to Paypal at this stage, bitcoin should just shut down.\n\nI wasn't arguing that fees should be as high as Paypal.": 1, "     \nIt seems like there could be some sort of targeted ratio (or range of ratios) between number of transactions:nodes that could adjust the tx fee accordingly.

Granted I'm talking about the 100 years from now example.  In your example Satoshi would need more soldiers to keep the network secure, but I think soldiers = hashing power, not necessarily miners.  If we kept the same amount of miners, and the technology got better for mining, which it obviously will, wouldnt it work itself out?  In my example, Satoshi doesnt get more soldiers, but their soldiers get guns to replace their swords, and missiles to replace their cannons.\n\nAnother thought, transaction fees are measured in fractions of bitcoins, lets use .0001 as an example, as its worth about $.05,  When Satoshi opens up his castles, and the peasants all start using his money, Satoshi can never print more money, so the value of the existing currency has to go up because of scarcity.

Surely a much better virtual currency would replace bitcoin - but it seems like this has proven futile as the alt coin graveyard demonstrates. No other inflation schedule is significantly better than bitcoins to the point where we are all abandoning bitcoin. The most important characteristic of bitcoins inflation schedule is that it is assumed to be set in stone. The next important is that it is on a long enough timeframe so that people who are not necessarily early adopters can benefit from the influx of new coins either through mining or through lower prices from the miners selling, but short enough so that there is a strong incentive to accumulate sooner rather than later (read never).\n\nPerhaps this is the most important piece of bitcoins value proposition: Nobody has an incentive to change the 21 million cap.\n\n': 3, 'So, the discussion of mining pools accepting one form or another is simply for endorsement not toward the technical requirement for altering the protocol?': 1}, ('Crypto-Counseling: Smart Contracts in Psychotherapy (Part 1: Theory)', 2): {}, ('Why Bitcoin isn\'t the universal currency in "Star Wars" movies?', 0): {"Yep, it wasn't invented yet.\n\n>**A long time ago** in a galaxy far far away....": 2, 'In the 50s and 60s, there was a fair amount of work being done talking about what Galbraith termed the ["Affluent Society"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Affluent_Society). The basic idea was that America and the West had overcome the problems of basic sustenance, and given the wealth available in those countries, there was really no reason for people to actually work. \n\nThe logic was pretty simple. Galbraith argued that the pursuit of economic efficiency only makes sense if it leads to a corresponding increase in quality of life. IE, a device that increases bread production by a factor of five is a hugely important device, because it enables five times more people to be fed. However, in the 50s and 60s, with the rise of mass advertising (which Galbraith argued "invented" demand, as opposed to naturally-occuring demand for things like housing, bread, water, etc that don\'t require billboards), the thinking was that there was no reason for people to work just as hard as they had in the past, because their real, non-"fake" (ie, created by advertising) needs could be easily met. For Galbraith, while pursuing greater economic efficiency made sense insofar as it created more bread, pursuing even more economic efficiency so as to enable the purchase of more worthless gadgets does not. There is a law of diminishing returns.\n\nAnyway, that logic combined with utopian predictions of the rise of robots, making most human labor unnecessary, led to many thinkers concluding that the traditional idea of people working their entire lives, just for money, was now pointless. Instead, people would work on the things they wanted to work on, with the result being a much happier, albeit less productive, society. Economists thought people, who value leisure time, would choose more leisure time over working longer hours, because their basic needs had been met and so working became a choice between acquiring more stuff they didn\'t need, or enjoying leisure.\n\nThe best example of this is George Jetson, who worked 3 hours a day, had everything taken care of by robots, and zipped home to be with his family.\n\nAnyway, the point of all that is, this thinking was part of the economic and futurist zeitgeist of the 1950s and 1960s. It would not surprise me if Roddenberry, being in his 30s and 40s during that time, was aware of those concepts and incorporated it into Star Trek. After all, the people on the Enterprise aren\'t there for a paycheck, and food / water / sustenance are all readily obtainable at the push of a button.

However, there is ample evidence to the contrary. It is, quite literally, a proven fact. \n\nThis is precicesly what I mean when I say it\'s pointless to sell to end users.

But somehow, the fact that you didn\'t believe it was not YOUR fault, no it must have been someone elses.\n\nThat is directly from federal court documents. You can also find similar through the Internet Archive. Somewhere in the mountain of Court Documents you\'ll also find a page from the shopping cart just before you pay for an order, with similar, yet more stern verbiage telling you not to order if you don\'t want to risk waiting. Both the Federal Court papers and the Internet Archive provide you with incontrovertible proof to the contrary (That no promises on delivery were made and that you were literally told not to order if you did not want to risk waiting) for your anecdotal evidence.

So again, before you bang out a knee jerk response about how I don't know what I am talking about, go find any evidence at all that a promise for a delivery time-frame was made. What you will find is an estimate with multiple warnings that it may be delayed. You will also find multiple requests for you to not order if you aren't willing to accept the possibility of delays...

Hailed as \xe2\x80\x9cdisrupters,\xe2\x80\x9d small fintech firms offering products and solutions ranging from mobile payments to crowd funding are cropping up. Fintech firms will diversify the finance industry, and innovative banks will also benefit by incorporating new and cutting-edge ideas for customers. With the hype of fintech reaching deafening levels in 2015, and investments in the space witnessing 2-3X increases, the sector will become much more competitive in 2016.\n2.\tCorporate Social Responsibility as a Differentiator: When a company is near the top of the Dow Jones Sustainability Index one week and then caught with software to flaunt environmental regulations the next, the concept of corporate social responsibility (CSR) is challenged. The impact on VW and spotlight on regulation aside, 2016 will bring a new meaning to CSR, and many companies will use it to set themselves apart.\n3.\tAugmented Reality Goes Mainstream: 2016 will be a year of major content development for augmented and virtual reality. We will see many launches and announcements of Oculus Rift-type products and their applications. I am told it will change the gaming industry and will become a money spinner once it is used in the porn industry\n4.\tMillennial Power: Millennials have come of age and are big business. As global Millennials enter the 16-35 age range, they are entering a new phase of purchasing power. At the low end, the traditional first buys, such as cars, are slowly being replaced by Uber; at the high end, they are now considering buying a house or a car.\n5.\tThe Dragon Stumbles and the Elephant Runs: In 2016, China will enter its slowest growth phase in two decades as GDP growth forecasts in China fall below 7%. India is on a strong growth path, benefitting from recent policy reforms, its \xe2\x80\x9cMade in India\xe2\x80\x9d campaign, a consequent pickup in investment, and lower commodity prices. The Indian domestic demand is set to remain bullish and inflation is expected to fall. In 2016, India is expected to register 7.5% growth and cross that of China.\n6.\tEverything is \xe2\x80\x98Uberised\xe2\x80\x99: Businesses will follow consumers into the sharing economy. Corporate car- and home-sharing will lead the way, with Uber, Skype, and Airbnb set to launch corporate services. Companies will leverage each other\xe2\x80\x99s assets to avoid diseconomies of scale, with an aim to operate at 100% capacity and 0% idle time.\n7.\tWomen as the Next Frontier of Growth: Countries, organizations and industries are looking to capitalize on the gender dividend. Next year will see an increase in aggressive policies by governments and boards to raise their diversity ranking in a bid to boost both GDP and the bottom line. 2016 will throw up examples of gender diversity as a profit booster and at the same time help change corporate culture, like at VW.\n8.\tBlockchain Experts for Hire: Pioneers in the financial services industry are experimenting with how blockchains (a digital ledger) could be used for transaction clearing, back-office functions and cross-border payments. Blockchains could replace existing systems and streamline banking processes. The risk is having to speak to the new in-house blockchain expert at next year\xe2\x80\x99s Christmas party.\n9.\tThe Next 11: Recent turmoil across the BRICS regions is shifting companies\xe2\x80\x99 focus to newly emerging hotspots such as Mexico, Vietnam, and Nigeria. Those economies have started to exhibit strong economic, technological, and social growth and are likely to contribute 20% more to the global GDP than in the past. Apart from these countries, I would put my money on Indonesia, Romania, Algeria, and some other selected countries in Asia and Africa.\n10.\tChina-Russian Alliance: This new friendship could disrupt the current world trade order through currency swaps and possible gas lines. A challenge to existing superpowers, the world waits to see exactly how this agreement will manifest in formal policy. Europe could be most affected as the recession in Russia brings these two nations closer to each other and China finances some critical infrastructure routes like the old silk route and the Trans-Siberian railroad link.\n11.\tThere is no App for That: Intelligent solutions such as Siri and Cortana leveraging artificial intelligence are quelling our past hunger for apps on our connected devices. 2016 will see businesses increasingly adapt these platforms for B2C and B2B marketing purposes.\n12.\tCyber Battle Good vs. Evil: Next year will see a major showdown between the global community of cyber criminals and a rapidly forming team of big business and governments. Crime has been focused on the financial services sector, where the prize is high, but as more industries become connected \xe2\x80\x93 such as healthcare \xe2\x80\x93 an attack is more likely. The good news is policymakers will draft new cyber security and data protections laws, with the US expected to lead in development of cyber laws and Europe on data protection.\n13.\tWhat\xe2\x80\x99s my incentive? Consumers will accept incentives to purchase certain items or exhibit certain behaviours. Examples include paying consumers $500 per month to choose cheaper pharmacy options, rewarding consumers for using specific search engines, or entering account holders into a lottery based on how much money they save (in a bid to increase liquidity in banks).\n14.\tOnline Marketplaces outpace Traditional Retail: Big data and mobile-based apps and platforms present myriad opportunities for marketplace deliveries and solutions. 2016 will see the growth of marketplace-as-a-service in more industries, such as logistics and healthcare, where traditional supplier networks once dominated.\n15.\tA Jobless Future?
