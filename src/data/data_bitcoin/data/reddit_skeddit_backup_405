This seems entirely conclusory. There\'s no reason the rate of deflation couldn\'t outstrip economic growth, particularly if hoarding leads to a deflationary spiral.\n\nIt\'s just a weak form of the quantity theory of money based on the fisher equation, MV=PY.  I call it a weak form since I don\'t assume velocity is constant, but rather operates within a band.  Since M is constant (fixed supply of BTC) and V drifts within a band but is ultimately constrained by the practical realities of economic activity, over the long term you expect the price level (P) to move roughly inversely with the real output of the economy (Y).  In other words, deflation (the inverse of the rate of change of the price level) loosely follows real economic growth, at least over the long term. \n\nDeflationary spirals are a rather misleading way of describing a rapid deleveraging event.  They don\'t go on forever, and they only can happen dramatically if you start from a severely over-leveraged position in the first place.  They stop when smart people realize money is being overvalued, because the smart thing to do when money is overvalued is to spend it... unless you think it\'s going to be increasingly and increasingly overvalued ad infinitum, in which case imho you are not a very smart person (I\'m speaking generally here, not specifically to you).  A "deflationary spiral" that goes on past the point of healthy deleveraging is simply an unsustainable bubble in the price of money, and unsustainable bubbles pop sooner or later.\n\n> How does this indicate a misallocation of resources? Seems to me this policy does exactly what it was intended to do: incentivizes people to seek a return >4% by investing and growing the economy. Seems much healthier than incentivizing people to stick their money in a coffee can and let it gain risk-free value by doing nothing.\n\nI was worried I didn\'t make that point very clearly - I wasn\'t intending to imply that the example is a misallocation of resources (more so the opposite, actually).  The "misallocation" comment was meant to stand alone, which wasn\'t clear from the context.  The point of the example was to demonstrate that loans in a bitcoin economy wouldn\'t look that different than they do now as long as you account for real values vs nominal, since regardless of the monetary system, people naturally try to avoid unproductive loans.  \n\nReal interest rates would probably be slightly higher in a bitcoin economy (lower in nominal terms), probably by a percent or two.  If you think we have a bad habit of over-incentivising credit expansion in our current monetary regime (tends to happen when your solution to an abundance of bad credit is more credit), then a bit higher real rates on average would be quite healthy.\n\nOn that note, the idea that stuffing money under a mattress has no productive effect on the economy is completely false.  It\'s no different than a distributed loan to the entire economy, and if that economy is growing and therefore you have deflation, then you earn a real return (zero nominal of course) on that loan.  It\'s similar in concept to how losing/burning coins is in the long term similar in effect to donating them to all other coin holders (proportionally to their holdings), since money taken out of circulation is no longer competing for real resources with their own.  The only difference with a mattress stuffer is that they only "lose" their coins temporarily - at some point they take them back by digging them out of the mattress.

We are locked in, that ship has sailed.\n\nBlockchains fundamentally converge towards high value usage, doesn't matter what you cook up in your head, this always happens. As I've previously explained, block size IS LIMITED. BY PHYSICS. Block space isn't infinite even at 200MB which is impossible for the network to handle until ten *years* from now **at best**.

We will be in the SAME situation. You are essentially advocating to put lipstick on a pig, but worse than that you\'re taking the pig to slaughter!

The sooner that happens, the sooner Bitcoin resolves the last great source of uncertainty about its future. ': 6, "> You must not understand how blockchains work, and hence why Bitcoin is impossible to dethrone.\n\nThis is what I mean about complacency. I'm a bitcoin proponent not a critic, and of course I'm aware of the network effects, but there's a limit to how much of our shit the market will put up with.\n\n> Because Bitcoin was first, and because it has the most adoption, it also has the most liquidity and security and hence the most USEFULNESS as a currency. How will any altcoin unseat that?\n\nYou're specifically trying to push people's transactions off bitcoin and onto something else. Coinbase needs a load of personal information and is a PITA, and neither lightening network nor sidechains even exist yet, and if they did we don't know if they'd work as hoped in the real world. The market will find a something else that people can actually USE to transact with, and that something, by definition, will be more USEFUL. If you force your users to go away, they will, and you don't get to decide where they go instead.\n\nSo where you end up is that one day more people take X than bitcoin, X has more liquidity and better network effects, people buy it to use, speculators notice and the price starts to ramp up while bitcoin does the opposite, and miners find it more profitable to mine X than bitcoin (if X uses mining). All this could happen very, very quickly. At this point it's not obvious that the rapidly plummeting bitcoin would be the go-to choice as a store of value.\n\nBTW your numbers assume no improvements in anything except Moore's Law, which is probably overly pessimistic, and keep bitcoin usable on a high-end PC/network, which is much more conservative than Satoshi's suggestion that nodes could take whole data-centers. But just doing that you're at something like 1 transaction per day for everyone in the entire world in 20 years, then 32 transactions each in 30 years. It's more likely Lightening Network or something else takes some of the load off that in the meantime, but you don't need to cripple the network in the meantime for this to happen, because they have plenty of other advantages, not least being a lot faster. In practice it's not worth trying to optimize for what's going to happen years down the line - the immediate problem is just to keep bitcoin growing for the next 1 to 3 years.": 11, '> "But I should mention, Bitcoin costs a $1.00 to send"\n> "Oh, nvm, would rather LOSE ALL MY MONEY GUARANTEED"\n\nThis is very complacent. Bitcoin isn\'t their only option. Most use cash or German banks. In any case Satoshi\'s system is now available to anyone, so if the people running bitcoin decide they don\'t want to scale it like Satoshi intended, somebody else will and their system will win the payments business over bitcoin. Alternatively some unrelated system will win - there\'s a lot of innovation in the fintech space nowadays.\n\nIt\'s possible that at this point bitcoin will still be valued as "digital gold" even if it\'s not useful for paying people any more, but it\'s certainly not inevitable. I don\'t think it\'s even likely: The world wants one money, and if you have the choice between savings you can spend and savings you can only sell, there\'s no particular reason to prefer the crippled version.\n\nThe weird thing right now is that while the outside world sees bitcoin as a disruptive technology that might succeed in future, much of the community is behaving like it\'s already won. Bitcoin is already turning itself into a slow, lumbering incumbent that takes its customers for granted. The danger here is always thay by the time the incumbent sees somebody else out-competing it, the game is already over.': 6, '> You are essentially advocating to put lipstick on a pig, \n\nI am beginning to understand that the block size war is between those who want to put lipstick on the pig and those who think it should get a hair extension job first.': 1, 'transaction fees.

The sums in I did in my head (which I think match yours) were based on doubling every 2 years, which is slightly slower than that, and significantly slower than Moore's Law. Obviously we can't be sure this will happen and it could go slower or faster, so I'm not saying we can necessarily hard-code these numbers in the software right now, but the point I'm making is that even with no other improvements long-term on-chain bitcoin-everywhere does actually sound doable, if it were to come to that. But frankly scalability is the least of our problems getting from here to there - I agree with you that even moderate short-term growth isn't nailed on.\n\nAnyhow what we need to be doing short-term to preserve and grow the network effects is optimizing for the needs of customers, including transacting when they want and at low cost.

Just as the DJ and electronic music pioneer stands before a crowd effortlessly manipulating gigabytes of music from a single iPad, the back offices of the world\xe2\x80\x99s financial institutions are supposed to allow traders to switch in and out of trillions of dollars worth of assets without skipping a beat.\n\nIn reality, their performance looks more like Rick Wakeman, the keyboardist from the 1970s prog rock band Yes, who would frantically wave his wizard-robed arms as he yanked cables out of a dozen incompatible boxes.\n\nHarmonising the ledgers of the world\xe2\x80\x99s banks requires scarcely less skill and energy. Records of trades have to be compiled and entered into those systems from the phone calls, emails and post-lunch handshakes that constitute the original bargains. Reconciling those trades and ensuring that all parties have the same records is a painstaking business. Electronic trade confirmations help, especially for standardised products, but in many markets paper tickets are still the norm.\n\nNot all failures are as spectacular as those which culminated with Kweku Adoboli of UBS being found with up to $2bn of losses on unconfirmed deal tickets in his desk drawer. But mistakes slip through the net all the time, and cost money when they do. In the US Treasury market alone, about $50bn of trades \xe2\x80\x9cfail\xe2\x80\x9d every business day, incurring a charge equivalent to 3 per cent interest a year on the delinquent balances. Including private sector markets, the total volume of fails is likely to be in the hundreds of billions.\n\nIn the world of stadium rock, the problem of standardisation was solved long ago. You do not see Radiohead\xe2\x80\x99s Thom Yorke posing in front of a huge stack of electronics resembling a telephone exchange, because in 1983 the makers of synthesisers and keyboards agreed on a common standard that lets you plug one into another without an impressive work of amateur electronics.\n\nFinanciers may not have noticed, but a technology has been invented that would solve their compatibility problem, too. Its name is bitcoin, although it could probably do with a new one; a whiff of sulphur still clings to cryptographic currencies because of their historical association with anarchists and the customers of the Silk Road online narcotics emporium. Richard Gendal of IBM has suggested that the underlying system should be called \xe2\x80\x9cshared ledger technology\xe2\x80\x9d instead.\n\nSo far as legitimate finance is concerned, the utility of this technology has little to do with its supposed ability to make transactions untraceable \xe2\x80\x94 a feature, if that is what it is, which can easily be switched off. It has everything to do with the \xe2\x80\x9cblockchain\xe2\x80\x9d, a public record of transactions that is updated whenever one person sends payment in bitcoins to another. Every bitcoin user can consult this shared ledger, and any copy is as good as another; there is no uniquely authoritative source. Clever encryption keeps the copies in sync, by making it easy to tell whether one of them has been doctored.\n\nThis is exactly what securities settlement needs: a way of recording every transaction once, sharing that record between the counterparties in exactly the same form, and updating in an agreed and standardised manner. It provides an easy way to set up the settlement systems for new or customised products.\n\nIt also automatically creates a full, agreed record of transactions, which would assist risk management and compliance functions hugely. And, with such a system in place, it should be straightforward to ensure that netting opportunities are never missed; if one trader sells units in an exchange traded fund and a colleague buys units in the same fund, their institution need not transact with any external parties.\n\nThere is the potential for cost savings that go well beyond eliminating mistakes. Back office employees earn salaries into six figures for reconciling settlements and confirming trades by hand. (One of the shameful secrets of financial services is how many people do jobs that could be made obsolete by a small computer program for pasting data from one window into another.)\n\nThe biggest obstacle to the adoption of \xe2\x80\x9cshared ledger\xe2\x80\x9d, of course, is one which has delayed much necessary investment in the past. It is unlikely that the banks will take on bitcoin in its current form, so they will have to agree on the design of a new standard. That means working together and trusting each other.

Like any form of advertising, you need to see it 5x before it registers once.\n\nAssuming that passerby already has Blockchain or some other BTC app ready to go on the mobile, we're all set.  Most people don't.   But seeing one there, after hearing about the mysterious cyber currency, might get some one online - maybe on this sub - to research how to USE that ATM.  Little by little.\n\nSo we exchanged niceties and she headed for the Staten Island Ferry, the same one Billy Joel sings about.  I've never been on the ferry - and Whitehall Station is pretty much ONLY for people commuting between Manhattan and Staten Island via ferry - so this ATM seems targeted to that particular cross-section of NYC.\n\nOr you can walk about five minutes from Whitehall Station to Wall Street - and the New York Stock Exchange - and the Bitcoin Exchange at 40 Broad - which has an even less apologetic transaction fee:\nhttp://imgur.com/2HqxVZ0\nBTC was still at $249 when I got here, so this is in the neighborhood of a 10%+ fee.\n  \nAnyway, as to Whitehall Station - great ATM, lots of foot traffic - safe, clean area - but here's MY question: \n\nThe Staten Island Ferry estimates it transports 70,000 people each day.\n\nBy contrast, if you head into midtown Manhattan 3 miles north, Grand Central Station (east side) estimates daily traffic of 750,000 people; New York Penn Station (west side) estimates daily foot traffic of 650,000.   \n\nWhy aren't there Bitcoin ATMs in either of THESE stations?  No offense to the good citizens of Staten Island (population: 473,000), but Grand Central and Penn Stations transport people to... the other four boroughs of NYC (population: 8,000,000+, aka 2.5% of America) ...and Connecticut (3.6M), New Jersey (8.9M), and - if you throw in Amtrak - another 20 states around the country (you can take a train to Vegas!), plus Montreal and Toronto (4.2M combined) in neighboring Canada\n\nLocation, location, location - what would it take to get a Bitcoin ATM in one or both of the most heavily trafficked locations in North America? \n": 3, 'Thanks for this - I will be checking this out myself very shortly as I am very curious about the transaction process.': 1}, ('The future is block chain | The National Business Review', 47): {"Which blockchain?

Let's hope in this election year the Canadian federal government doesn't decide to do something rash and silly.": 42, 'CHAPTER 4: CONCLUSION \n\nIn the Committee\xe2\x80\x99s view, it is the case that legislators, governments, central banks, private-sector entities in a range of sectors, customers, merchants, investors and others are considering the opportunities and challenges that digital currencies present. \n\nAfter hearing from a broad range of witnesses in Ottawa, and traveling to New York City for a factfinding trip, the Committee has concluded that digital currencies and their technologies present a variety of opportunities. In the Committee\xe2\x80\x99s view, it is likely that the innovation underlying these currencies and technologies has applications that have not yet been imagined. There is evidence that they reduce transaction costs, increase the choices available to customers and merchants, protect users\xe2\x80\x99 identities and record all transactions. A key focus, then, is the actions that the federal government and other entities could take to maximize those opportunities. \n\nEqually, the Committee acknowledges that digital currencies and their technologies present a range of challenges. Money laundering, terrorist financing, losses due to cyber-theft, bankruptcy of digital currency exchanges, price volatility, and a range of taxation issues are serious obstacles for a government whose primary duty is to protect its citizens. \n\nTherefore, the Committee strongly believes that a balanced regulatory approach is needed in the digital currency sector. On one hand, the Committee is mindful that the government has the responsibility to protect consumers and root out illegal activity. On the other hand, it is critical that government action does not stifle innovation in digital currencies and its associated technologies that are in an early and delicate stage of development. \n\nHaving completed the study, the Committee is of the opinion that the opportunities presented by digital currencies, technologies and businesses outweigh the challenges. The Committee is confident that the implementation of our recommendations will have positive outcomes for consumers, merchants, digital currency-related businesses, Canada\xe2\x80\x99s financial services sector and others. The Committee looks forward to timely government action designed to maximize the opportunities and manage the challenges facing the digital currency sector\n': 28, 'Or being healthy and able to read and write and move freely and vote and complain and bitch on online forums and the million other freedoms you enjoy and clearly take for granted.': 1, "I'm not seeing anything different here.
