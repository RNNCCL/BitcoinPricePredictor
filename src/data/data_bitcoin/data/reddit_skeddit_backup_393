I mean you should hear some of these conversations I have with non economic majors (I got my phD in economics), they tend to just make up their own economic theories which hold zero value.  Sounds kind of like this.\n\n>And he say the great thing about FIAT currency is if there is crisis you just devaluate your currency and you are competitive again.\n\nYour government needs to control it's currency.  This is no different than USA firing drone missles into another country or China coming out with a new stealth mechanism for their submarines.  They need to keep their power (in this case, a good storage of value).  Sometimes their national citizens do stupid things (car manufacturers go belly up due to incompetence) or are bamboozled into stupid things (subprime loan crisis).  Then the same government must protect their citizens.  Devaluing their currency will protect everyone (not just a select few) against larger problems when done correctly.\n\nWithin all of that, you will still have a fringe outset of citizens who exploit the protections to increase their wealth. I believe this is the problem people have with devaluing of currency.  Realistically, macroeconomics proves that inflation is almost necessary since we as humans are constantly inflating.  At some point we need to balance the need for personal wealth and the continued growth of humanity (hodling money does nothing for me and everything for you).  For instance, here in America, we are at the crux of that balance shift (minimum wage almost doubling) as we have been growing personal/economic wealth for almost 20 years while ignoring the people who keep the country going. \n\n>And I tell him but other country will do the same and it's race to the bottom, where people get robbed of their saving...\n\nThis is a very real problem and is called a Currency war.  We don't want war, but China also doesn't want America's dirty recyclables that China then needs to spend money on to put it back into production.  China has asked that we send only clean recyclables but to make sure we, America, understands this, China lowers their currency to increase the power of the USD (and lower the gains from exporting the crap from America).  Now China has a valid tactical hold against USA and USA must truly consider changing it's recycling practice.  This actual war I described, while entirely possible, has a lot more factors -- and the currency war is not to force america to recycle, but to force america (or any other country the war is/are between) into accepting the other country's monetary policy.\n\nThen there is the issue about savings.  The idea behind fiat currency is you don't hoard it, you make money by putting it to work.  Investments make money.  The bagel shop you started makes money.  Your house makes money.  Your bank account does not make money.  On top of all of that, there are extremely low risk investments that will easily beat inflation (AT&T comes to mind)\n\n>But the guy couldn't see that as an issue and for him Bitcoin with his fixed supply was dangerous..\n\nBitcoin's utility is low.  There is a lot of risk in bitcoin which makes it dangerous.  There is no saying that bitcoin will be worth 50% what it is today in 10 years.  It is extremely unlikely that USD, EUR, CNY, etc will be 50% less in 10 years.  There is no saying that litcoin will take over bitcoin, etc.  That said, those who didn't invest partly in Apple, Pets.com, Netflix, Tesla early on are still kicking themselves.  Those who invested everything into e.g. Netflix was probably really scared when netflix dropped from $80/share to $15/share.  Those who invested a little bit are the ones who are very comfortable today.  \n\nTL;DR: invest in bitcoin, but don't go balls deep unless you're 21 and are okay with potentially losing half or more of their money in 15 years\n": 1, 'Indirectly related to Bitcoin, but the video was great.

It will be a melee where no one will know how much they  should pay, nor whether what they offered will be enough to get service.  The RBF and CPFP policies will only make it worse, much worse.\n\nThe second problem is what will be the result of saturation.  For sure, many transactions that would be issued with bigger blocks will be suppressed if the blocks are bounded to 1 MB.  Whenever the tx rate gets above 360\'000, even for an hour or so,  a backlog will form, and some transactions will be delayed for variable lengths of time.  If the policy was first-come-first-served, the delays would be spread more or less equally over all transactions, no matter what they pay.  With RBF and CPFP, the delay will be more unpredictable: even a transaction that arrives early and pays many times the minimum fee may be delayed until the backlog clears.  \n\nTherefore, in the longer term the users will either give up on bitcoin, or restrict their activity, until the tx rate never goes above capacity (0.1 MB/min, ~350\'000 tx/day) for more than a couple of block intervals, even during peak hours.  At that stage, during peak hours the mean tx rate may be (say) 80% of the capacity, and the daily average may be 200\'000 tx or less.  Note that (1) **this will be the result independently of fee policies and client priorities**, just from the fact that any higher tx rate will render the network unusable; and (2) **there will be no fee market** -- because, without a backlog, the fees are irrelevant.  \n\nThus, it is naive to expect that the "fee market" will provide the 400\'000 USD/day (2 USD/tx) of fees that miners will need to compensate for the next halving.  It is like a supermarket owner expecting to make more money by restricting the number of cash registers until the lines become really long, and then telling customers that they may jump the line by paying a surcharge.\n\nFinally, there is the question of who will be the users in that steady state.  What sort of user is more likely to keep using bitcoin in spite of jams, unpredictable delays, and having to monitor the queues after issuing a transaction, in case it needs an RBF/CPFP?  Who is more likely to keep increasing the fees, while other users just give up?  He won\'t be the guy who likes bitcoin because it is fast, cheap, and frictionless.

In advanced invocation modes, the running times\n    are slightly higher, but are still very acceptable.\n    \n    For example, let\'s generate 10 random numbers in the range 0 to 9:\n    \n    $ php5 -r \'mt_srand(1234567890); for ($i = 0; $i < 10; $i++) { echo mt_rand(0, 9), " "; } echo "\\n";\'\n    6 6 4 1 1 2 8 4 5 8\n    \n    and find the seed(s) based on these 10 numbers using our HPC Village\n    machine\'s CPUs (2x Xeon E5-2670):\n    \n    [solar@...er php_mt_seed-3.2]$ GOMP_CPU_AFFINITY=0-31 time ./php_mt_seed 6 6 0 9  6 6 0 9  4 4 0 9  1 1 0 9  1 1 0 9  2 2 0 9  8 8 0 9  4 4 0 9  5 5 0 9  8 8 0 9\n    Pattern: EXACT-FROM-10 EXACT-FROM-10 EXACT-FROM-10 EXACT-FROM-10 EXACT-FROM-10 EXACT-FROM-10 EXACT-FROM-10 EXACT-FROM-10 EXACT-FROM-10 EXACT-FROM-10\n    Found 0, trying 1207959552 - 1241513983, speed 222870766 seeds per second \n    seed = 1234567890\n    Found 1, trying 4261412864 - 4294967295, speed 222760735 seeds per second \n    Found 1\n    615.57user 0.00system 0:19.28elapsed 3192%CPU (0avgtext+0avgdata 3984maxresident)k\n    0inputs+0outputs (0major+292minor)pagefaults 0swaps\n    \n    We found the correct seed (and there turned out to be only one such\n    seed) in under 20 seconds.\n    \n    What if we did not know the very first mt_rand() output (had only 9\n    known values out of 10, in this example)?

Making a process more complex only introduces more methods of optimizing.\n\n2) The reason ASIC-resistance is desirable to some is because some people would prefer if people started mining from home rather than data centers, making the network magnitudes more decentralized. A fine goal, but making the mining algorithm more complex doesn't somehow make home mining more profitable. *Everything* can be done cheaper and more efficiently in data centers, so this is a natural place for mining to move to. Making decentralized ownership possible would benefit the network more in this regard.\n\n3) It's harder to disprove shortcuts in complex algorithms than it is in simple algorithms. Shortcuts allow one to prove the same amount of work, while doing less. Already, some functions of SHA256 can be done more efficiently than normal, which miners are actively making use of (as they should).
