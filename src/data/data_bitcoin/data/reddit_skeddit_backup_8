After that I will stop gathering profits and instead use the profits I gain daily to increase my hash rate. According to my calculations, the hashrate can be doubled every 60 days by using this method. When I feel like the ponzi is starting to collapse, I stop upgrading the hash rate and start collecting bitcoins again on my wallet.\n\nThe reason I'm going to do this is because the chance of the ponzi collapsing within the first 85 days is small considering the website is increasing in popularity and has been up for at leasy 17 months. After that, there is no more risk of losing money and instead you have a good shot at earning a shit ton of money daily after exponentially increasing your hash rate for a few months. \n\nLong story short, even though this website is obviously a Ponzi, we can still profit from the website owners and the new users by using some common sense. And I mean profit a lot, especially when the website doesn't collapse any time soon.\n\nExample: Original investment of 10 bitcoins. 10 bitcoins returned after around 85 days.

If the thread says "A is a Ponzi" then I\'d expect A not to be a safe investment.\n\nWhen it says a service is legit, that means that they are actually performing hashing. It still doesn\'t mean that it will be a profitable investment. \xe2\x80\x93\nIMHO cloudmining as an investment seems to be a mistake altogether. I remain utterly unconvinced of the whole business model. \n\nMining itself already has a very slim return rate, then putting both your investment and the hardware into the hands of a third party that wants an additional cut seems counterintuitive.

Blockchains with proof of work are a consensus mechanism for strongly distrusting actors, completely unnecessary in the banking world that can fall back on the legal system for enforcement. So PoW is out. What remains is a decentralized database that at some point will come to a stable state. You can probably use it to implement useful things, but at that point, you\'re back to technology that existed long ago with a new fancy name.\n\nRegular database systems can likely provide similar properties without the risk of orphan blocks and thus with much better guarantees that make using it easier.\n\nAlso, there is no reason why blockchains being used by banks should excite Bitcoiners more than e.g. ECDSA or LevelDB being used by banks...\n\nThe genius part about Bitcoin is not the P2P network, the block chain, the proof of work, the ledger, the signatures, etc. - it\'s the combination.': 2, 'It\'s sort of the beautiful thing about all of this.

Double entry ledgers kept private are easy to cheat with. That is the reason we need so much regulation to keep banks in check. This has still failed however.  Malfeasance and scam is prevalent and unpunished. \n\nBitcoin is sunlight and bleach to all of this. Central bank ledger management is replaced by algorithm. Third party intermediation (banks) is replaced by cryptographic transfer.  Failures due to fractional reserve debt collapse is replaced by transparency and having asset without liability.  Risk allocation is not a monopoly; fiat distribution is.\n\nFiat can not be put natively on a blockchain. The more banks use Bitcoin, the quicker they hasten their demise.

OR do you genuinely not understand? Let\'s break it down, and you can tell me whether at any point you get stuck in your reasoning.\n\nCurrently we have ASIC technology "x". This isn\'t really "patented" as more than a specific design, it\'s a chip die process, which goes very closely with the rest of silicon on the industry. With ASIC "x", for every 100$ of electricity I spend, I get $120 from mining bitcoin.\n\nNow company "SupermagicGermanGuy", created an optimization for technology "x", called "ASIC X+". With ASIC X+, getting $120 from mining bitcoin will only require me to spend $90 in electricity. It\'s a 10% more efficient design. So he goes and patents, it, in the hopes of making some $$$, or in Core\'s minds, destroying bitcoin.\n\nThis is, quite literally (excepting for the names and fake, yet proportionally accurate, figures), the situation we have now. \n\nSo SupermagicGermanGuy wants to "control all of mining". There\'s currently, say, some $100mil in current-gen (ASIC "x") invested and online. So in order to "control mining", he refuses to sell his patented hardware to **anyone**, except people who would be alligned with his nefarious purposes (let\'s say, to run "Bitcoin Classy"; which should scare the shit out of us, and certainly should scare the incumbents from the current reference implementation, "Bitcoin Score"). So how does he do it? He only has a design, so obviously he can\'t just give hardware away. If he\'s **that** commited to destroying Bitcoin, surely he\'d be willing to forfeit his rightful up to 10% premium he could charge on current tech hardware (on account of his tech\'s efficiency gains), so he does *just that*. But the hardware still needs to be paid for from the factory.\n\nNow what? Now a nefarious person willing to destroy bitcoin would need to come up with a whopping **90 million dollars** in order to buy all this more efficient hardware, which isn\'t available for buying to nobody else, in order to just barely match the current hashrate of the network.\n\nSo yeah, in reality, this "nefarious and malicious patent" what essentially, and only allows, would be for a bad actor to get a 10% discount in order to attack the network.\n\nHow on earth does this "make the patent holder become the gatekeeper to mining in the US and Europe"?

So running the network hashrate, as it was in mid 2010, would take less electricity than a mobile phone charger.  \n\nOf course a modern ASIC miner is thousands of times more energy efficient than a 2010 PC miner and a bitcoin is worth 10,000 times more than in mid 2010.\n\nIn summary the network hashrate depends only on the value of the mined Bitcoins and the energy efficiency of the mining hardware.

This way it is ensured that on average about every 10 minutes a block is found.\n\nShould your hypothetical drastic reduction in network hashrate happen directly after a retarget it would take much longer than two weeks for the difficulty to adjust:\n\nWe are currently at about 1.3EHash/s. Let's assume a sudden drop to 1GHash/s. That would statistically reduce the block rate from 10min to 10min\\*(1.3e18/1e9)=24733a (Yes, that's *years*.)\n\nLuckily to wipe out this much hashing power all at once would take a catastrophic event that would probably also wipe out most human if not all life on earth.

However the bitcoin network may require an additional Miners Fee which affects the speed your transactions are verified and helps support the network.

Transactions will be significantly slower to confirm.\n\n>Normal - Follow the fee policy suggested by the mainline bitcoin client. Recommended.\n\n>Generous - Fees will be set to ensure transactions are high priority (0.001 BTC Base Fee).\n\n\n\n*Yeah, not going to happen I\'m afraid. We get this a lot where people want to squeeze fees to the lowest possible amount and then cry foul when the miners reject them leaving them in limbo. Since the transaction is valid it just sits there on the network and can\'t be recalled. If the change output is high, say, 10 BTC then the user can\'t spend that until the transaction is mined and that won\'t happen because of the tight fee. So the user loses cash flow for potentially weeks until the transaction is taken out of the memory pool.*\n\n*The reason we can\'t just make better guesses at a fee is due to the limitations of SPV mode. We can\'t calculate the age of the coins because we don\'t have the full transaction history. As the network fees drop we respond by releasing a new version. At present the fees to guarantee fast inclusion in a block are about 10,000 satoshis and these are likely to drop to 1,000 satoshis sometime before Christmas. At that level (about 0.4 US cents) very few people will think they are being hard done by.

It is possible for a block explorer to say it's invalid but still have it accepted in a block by a miner because the explorer may be seeing the first one.
