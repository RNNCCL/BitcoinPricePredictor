It's worth mentioning that we are doing this campaign as a limited company rather than as individuals so that all accounts can be audited. So far we have spent \xc2\xa318,000 to get it this far. That is from our own pockets. We are not drawing a salary. We need about \xc2\xa380,000 to pay for specialist software development and card distribution. That is excluding servers, hosting, office rent, and when the shop opens that will cost an additional \xc2\xa315,000 every three months for rent in a busy commercial centre. Printing cards is very cheap, everything else required for them to work safely in existing commercial infrastructure is enormously expensive. The pie chart on the campaign page is accurate, presuming we get \xc2\xa3150,000.": 1, 'My largest question is this: where can people spend the bitcoin they buy with your vouchers? Are there any businesses in London or online UK businesses they can spend them? ': 1, "The QR code on the back of the hanger is purely for illustration purposes so the user knows what to expect, and so the code on the back of the card would be concealed (apart from in the case of the alternative card product that is a single perforated sheet).\n\nBut you've raised an interesting point. Our original user journey was a smooth sequence of events where the user would pick up the card, have it activated and scan the card with the app, without the 'friction' involved in having a scratch area on the card. That, rather than the minimal extra cost involved in card processing, was the thinking behind it. \n\nThe added value in the customer not feeling as though they had to rush to redeem could, as you suggest, be a selling point. We are going to do some thinking around this. Really good of you, though, to take the time to expand your original point and share your thoughts with us - thank you for helping us get this project right :)": 2, 'Is there any reason not to do a scratchcard?\n\nThe qr code doesn\'t just need to be protected before the card is activated. Someone could take a picture of the qr code, wait until they think someone has activated the card and use the code.\n\nIs the qr code on the back of the cardstock hanger, as seen in [this picture](https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/968726/files/20141029090748-three-steps.jpg?1414598868), the same as the qr code on the card? If it\'s not, then the hanger would protect the sensitive qr code until purchase, serving some of the same purposes as a scratchcard.\n\nOne way or another, after the card has been activated and removed from the hanger and until it\'s redeemed the qr code must be protected. A scratchcard would make that easier. One of the things a scratchcard does is it signals to the customer "this bit of information is sensitive, protect it." It also says "we are looking out for your security and taking every precaution we can."\n\nWithout a scratchcard customers have incentive to rush to redeem. With a scratchcard they will be more likely to put it off. More time before redemption is more time before you have to pay out. It may also increase the rate of people purchasing a card and forgetting to ever redeem it, which is free money to you.\n\nHaving a scratchcard would allow people to give/sell/trade the cards to other people with a reliable guarantee that the card hasn\'t yet been redeemed, in a similar manner to casascius coins (though not nearly as high end). It would increase the resalability of the cards.\n\nOne of the ideas behind physical bitcoins was to allow cash like, physical, hand to hand trade. Casascius coins don\'t work well for that because they are so high end and have such a high collectors value. Your cards could make physical trade of bitcoin backed value a reality.': 1, "If you search Airbitz.co for Bitcoin-accepting businesses in London (https://airbitz.co/search?term=&location=london), you'll see there are a few (probably Cex is one of the best-known), and most of them are based very near where we're planning the pop-up shop to be.

What\'s the issuance model behind LC?\n\nYou can exchange LC into underlying loan assets which will pay off as these particular loans are repaid.

Thanks for the lesson on goodlogic.": 1, "I think there are two reasons. \n\n1. Someone has personal interest in bitcoin doing poorly. Either through shorting out selling things. (some may fall in this but I don't think most do) \n\n2. People legitimately think it's a bad technology that is getting hyped to scam others. Like is you saw a friend in a multi-level marketing company and you think they are throwing their money away. \n\nThe second is what I think makes up most of them. When you look at posts of people who lost a lot of money on bitcoin ie buy in at 1k now look at it. This is because of the stage bitcoin is in. It's speculation which means hype is all that matters for the price. Many people are hyping bitcoin for personal financial gain short term. When you put thousands of dollars into something and start to see the price drop your going to do what ever you can to try to get the price back up and in most cases that means trying to create more hype. What does this do if successful on an individual level such as friends and family? They buy in but it's not enough hype  to change the market so the price continues down and now you've lost money and so has the people you convinced to join in. \n\nI think this is what most buttcoiners feel they are protecting. And rightfully so because if I'd have push someone into bitcoin when I thought the price was really low ($500) I'd feel like shit today because I got them to do that. Even my girlfriend wanted me to invest some of her money and trade it because I was doing well but I refused to because if I lose my money that's my problem but if I lost hers that's our problem but my fault. Told her if she wanted to she could but I wouldn't do it for her because I simply wasn't confident in what bitcoin would do short term. I hype it a ton to her but if that's all she hears it's a very biased decision if she put her money in. \n\nOn top of this because hype and wider acceptance is needed for success it creates a cult like image where people identify themselves by bitcoin. This is an easy target to hit for them as well. Honestly we make it to easy of a target. \n\nTL;DR we did this to ourselves by having such investment in a speculative product that we risk others financial wellbeing to advance our own.

This is not "recognition" by any regulator...\n\nThe Central Banker gave a presentation about this so-called \'research paper\' that he wrote with Eden Shochat, a very aggresive [in a possitive way] venture capitalist from Aleph VC that focuses on crypto-technology and manages to really stear things [note: I really disslike VCs, but this guy is really working hard to move things in crypto-land].\n\nNonetheless -\n\na. the Central Banker is from the research department, and has nothing to do with the regulations, policy or monitoring aspects of the Israeli central bank. The paper is not intented for internal use, and was not referred to by a single autorative figure, neither in the bank, parliament, regulator, or any other civil service person.\n \nb. What he wrote together with Eden Shochat was not a \'research\' paper per se, but more like a \'look into\' the trend and aspects around Bitcoin. If anyone is waiting for a macroeconomic research paper, a simulation model or a recommensation/standpoint for the bank/goverment/regulators policy, then they are up for a BIG dissapointment.\n\nTo conclude - \n\n* Israel is no doubt a hub of research [in contrast to apps/services] innovation in this field (zero-cash, colored coins, mastercoin, to name a few). But these innitiatives/research appeals globally and are well below the Israeli regulator\'s radar or interest.\n\n* Israel will NEVER EVER lead anything when it comes to regulatory frameworks. It will ALWAYS wait to follow the USA lead. Anyone hoping/claiming otherwise, simply does not understand the local situation.\n\n* Bitcoin adoption in Israel is SEVERELY lagging behind N.
