Today.\n\n>For a majority of people, is it not yet convenient, easy, or intuitive enough to want to use it.\n\nThe majority of people are bovines.  Bitcoin is convenient, easy, and intuitive for **anybody** to use, today.  It\'s far easier to use than credit cards, bank accounts, or even cash.  This excuse that "it\'s too hard" is bogus.  People simply aren\'t even trying it yet.  Not trying Bitcoin != "Bitcoin is too hard to use"\n\n>"How do we get people to buy and spend bitcoins?"\n\nWhat the fuck is the purpose of buying a currency only to immediately spend it??\n\n>If and when the majority of consumers are clamoring to transact in bitcoins, it will take little convincing to get merchants to accept them.\n\nThis isn\'t a democracy.  Economics doesn\'t hinge on "the majority".  Change happens at the margin, over time.\n\n>Currently, the value of bitcoin is derived from its usefulness as a currency no more than the value of gold is derived from its usefulness in conducting electricity. Right now bitcoin is primarily purchased as commodity, store of value, speculative investment... but not often as a currency.\n\nPure nonsense.  Look up Thier\'s Law.  Study it.  Learn it.\n\n>What bitcoin needs is for the core technology to improve such that an average consumer feels comfortable storing and spending it, with low risk of loss due to theft of user error.\n\nAgain, average people are bovines.  The majority are bovines.  The core technology is here, and it\'s being used every day by a bunch of high schoolers who think they\'re edgy and smart.  It doesn\'t need improvement except in very specific ways that permit more efficient use of bandwidth and storage space.\n\n>TL;DR - Merchant adoption is outpacing consumer demand to spend btc.\n\n"Demand to spend."  Say that out loud.  Then get back to me with how stupid you realize that phrase is.\n\n>Demand is driven by btc being easy to use, not more places to spend it.\n\nIt\'s driven by neither of these things.  It\'s driven by the marginal utility of the currency.  The people who bother to learn how to use Bitcoin, and who bother to **save** their money rather than go out and spend it like the rest of the bovines, will be the ones who reap the bulk of the price appreciation.\n\nTL;DR:  Consumers are losers.  We need investors.  Bitcoin isn\'t a tunnel, it\'s the destination.\n': 1, "Which parts do you disagree with?

And rightfully so unless they are interested in speculative investing or have very specific transaction needs.

I don't think that merchant adoption is even going to be the key area for bitcoin adoption though. Buying stuff online is not a huge problem for people, it certainly could be better, more efficient and private, but by and large it's not a major pain point. As with any disruptive technology it's the underserved market that's important. Even there, user experience is going to be extremely important, but the benefits gained are more likely to be valuable in those markets, such that they will put up with the deficits in those areas.\n\nThe Microsoft announcement is mostly good in terms of legitimacy, and in bringing attention to a new audience, but by and large I don't think it will be a major driver of adoption simply because it doesn't particularly solve large problems right now.": 1, "A very valid point but I still think that companies as massive as Microsoft could bring a significant number of people, people that were previously curious.

A lot of those people are going to buy some Bitcoin for the first time.\n\n> Rather than hoping these people will give it another look, the focus should be on making bitcoin itself better.\n\nThere\'s no hoping, but actual action.  In this case, BitPay working with Microsoft to have them accept it, which inevitably leads to people giving it another look.\n\nThere is plenty of focus on making Bitcoin itself better.  There is also plenty of focus on spreading it to new people.  Of course more of both would be better, but I don\'t think the ratio of focus is too heavily split to either side.': 2, 'You make some excellent point.  Repeated exposure does get people interested in bitcoin, but your example (which is probably accurate) leads to more speculators - not more consumers transacting in bitcoins.  I would say speculators are good to some extent, helping support the price/interest/etc.  But without good things to speculate on (technological growth of the protocol and supporting projects) those people will lose interest, and stop providing value to the bitcoin project.\n\nI would personally argue the focus is in fact weighted too heavily towards spreading it to new people, rather than improving bitcoin itself.  But this is a generalization, and doesn\'t matter a lot since as you said, more is better in both cases anyways.

The key advantages this provides over credit cards and PayPal are:\n\n1.  It cuts out the middle-man, so you don\'t need to pay high fees to anyone.\n\n2.  It eliminates the need to "register" or "sign up" - anybody can receive and send this money to anyone else in any country at any time, and they don\'t need an email address or personal identifying information.\n\n3.  Sending money is much faster than with a credit card (and more secure if you\'re a merchant because people can\'t defraud you by executing a "charge back").\n\nThe other advantages of Bitcoin, which are slightly more abstract and political:\n\n4.  It eliminates the need for trusted third parties (TTPs), which is a major innovation in money - probably the biggest since the invention of double entry bookkeeping in the 14th century.\n\n5.  It makes sending large amounts of money internationally fast and cheap (or you can pass through an airport checkpoint with tens of millions of dollars worth of Bitcoin in your head, memorized as a passphrase).  It\'s quite James Bond.\n\n6.  It\'s impossible for governments to confiscate, freeze, tax, **inflate**, or even know who owns certain BTC.  (It is however possible for them to get your private keys if you leave them unsecured, and the process of securing them is slightly advanced - but it\'s easy once you know how).\n\n7.

I'm referring to the actual event of the lucky hash which solves the block. That event could come anywhere between 0.000000001+ milliseconds after the prior block, or it could come 100,000+ years after the prior block. All of these are technically possible. However, we know from probability and mathematics, that blocks are found most often around 10 minutes. In reality we see minutes more like, 8, 5, 18, 6, 11, etc.\n\nWhat i'm saying is, since changing the input of a hash radically changes the hash, my additional input (and of course, everyone's) is the difference between a block found at 5 minutes or 11, or the difference between a block found at 45 minutes vs 20.\n\nSaid another way: if miners would have continued without my tx, the ongoing probabilistic function would have a block found around 10 minutes. Let's say the actual block found (without my tx) in this pretend-world, was a 5 minute find.  Now with my tx introduced, and the radical changes I introduced into the outcomes of the block hashes with my tx, the exact same outcome would not happen, due to hashes being so radically different. So, with my tx included, the block would necessarily have to be found at a different time.\n\nThis is analogous to you flipping coins, and somebody bumps you as you are flipping a coin. Did they change the odds of flipping heads? No. Did they change the outcome of that particular flip? Maybe.\n\nIn the same way I nudge the miners with every tx, changing the hash input and output, the block solution, and every subsequent block finding time.\n\nThe reason this is so much more certain than flipping coins, is that heads/tails is a binary outcome= there are 2 possible outcomes. With mining there are 2039498234092450947852 x 2394802498702948357902348 possible outcomes (not exact!).

It only takes a split second for a miner to update a merkle root, it\'s not like any miner is "getting close" juuuuust before the merkle root changes... \n\nThe only time this is kinda relevant is in the delay it takes some mining hardware to stop working on a hash, and start over with fresh input.\n\nAlthough, yes, it is cool that every Tx affects the block hash, and therefore the entire future of the chain.

There are several different approaches malware can (and does) go around it.\n\n> If a malware knows a PIN, it cannot do anything.\n\nOh, it can do a lot of things. In the case of two-factor authentication used by the banks, it can try to highjack the second factor. Like, if you are sent a one-time password by SMS, the malware could infect your smartphone and monitor the SMS messages you receive.\n\nBut there is a more elegant approach, the equivalent of which would work here too. Basically, the malware doesn\'t care what your password (or other authentication method) is. It sits in the browser and waits for you to authenticate the session. Once this is done, it monitors the (already authenticated) session and changes the data. Like, you log in to your e-banking site (using whatever secure means you want) and instruct it to send $100 to Bob. The malware in the browser intercepts that (since it is in the browser, it can see the normally encrypted HTTPS session in the clear) and changes the transaction to say "send $1000 to Alice". It can even intercept the response from the e-banking site and modify it in such a way that it looks as if you have just made a transfer of $100 to Bob and your account has $100 less - while in reality the site is trying to tell you that you have just made a transfer to Alice and your account is $1000 less.\n\nThis is not a hypothetical attack - many malicious programs do exist that do just that.\n\nThe same kind of trick would work against this device too. Sit in the browser, wait until the user connects securely to the device and initiates a payment to someone\'s public key. Then change the payment on-the fly to send a different amount of Bitcoins to a different public key (i.e., Bitcoin address) - one controlled by the attacker.\n\nIt is a shame that the people who develop security products often have very little knowledge of malware and the tricks it uses.': 0, "I did actually, and also even if you did pay someone to make the cards with bip38 they don't know your passphrase.": 1, '/u/cactus-pits, ShooterJennings wants to send you a Bitcoin tip for 1 beer (10,016 bits/$3.50).

You go to a web site that says send X bitcoins to this blah-blah Bitcoin address. What you don't know, is that your browser is infected by malware that has already changed the information the site has sent you and the address you see there is something completely different from what is on the site.

It is not specific to Bitcoin. The on-line fiat banking has exactly the same problem - if you do it on a compromised machine, there is no way in hell to ensure that your transactions aren\'t being highjacked. Some banks claim to "solve" the problem with two-factor-authentication - I just explained you how malware bypasses that. You claim to solve it with your product - I just explained you how malware can bypass that.\n\nThe point is - you cannot trust the compromised machine. You cannot trust it to tell you the truth and you cannot trust it to relay truthfully your instructions. I haven\'t examined this BIP70 thingy in detail, but suspect that it will fail, too. If necessary, the malware will change what you see on the screen - including site name, URL, certificate information, result of certificate verification - anything necessary. If, at any point, you decide to trust anything the compromised machine is telling you, you are screwed. It doesn\'t matter whether you try to encrypt the session in the browser, or establish some kind of additional encrypted channel over that. At some point you\'ll see something on the screen and will enter something from the keyboard. If the machine is compromised and you choose to believe that - you are screwed.\n\nUnless you invent a protocol that encrypts and authenticates the information transfer from the merchant site to the user\'s brain, bypassing the potentially compromised machine completely, you cannot solve this problem, no matter how clever you try to be.\n\nYou cannot trust the compromised machine - period.\n\nSome banks try to resolve this problem by using a side channel - e.g., you get additional information regarding your transaction through a channel that is not your potentially compromised machine - like a smartphone, for instance. Which has simply led to malware infecting smartphones, in order to cover this channel, too.\n\nLook, I\'ve been in this business for quarter of a century already. I\'ve seen it all. The criminals win every time - because the human is the weakest link, no matter how clever technology tries to be. Nerds invented encryption - criminals didn\'t bother breaking encryption and invented password stealing. Nerds invented two-factor-authentication - criminals invented man-in-the-browser attacks. Nerds will invent something even more sophisticated - and the criminals will bypass that too.': 1, 'Awesome!

The private key is used to sign transactions, which are then broadcast to the network, and then locked into the blockchain by miners. If anyone gets your private key(s) they can steal your coins.\n\nSo when you get a wallet, its a good idea to backup the private keys, or in electrum\'s case a "seed phrase" made of 12 words.  The seed can be used to create all of the private keys and addresses for that wallet.  Hierarchical Deterministic (HD) wallets use seeds usually in the form of a 12 or 24 word phrase as the backup.
