Do we stop using Bitcoin because we can\'t predict how long a transaction will take to confirm? (No.). Do you deny that a user will have, on average, ~7 minutes to cancel/undo a transaction? If not, then I think average ~7 minutes is enough time for a user to gain value from being able to undo/cancel. It\'s a huge improvement over the current reality (no recourse, once a transaction has been made).\n\n> Not being able to undo transactions is simply not a pressing enough issue right now\n\nHow is it not a pressing issue? I already explained in previous posts (and in this post too now) why it\'s a big issue. Irreversibility is nice in some ways, but it\'s also very user-unfriendly. I feel paranoid every time I choose to make a BTC transaction, due to the irreversible nature. I literally triple check everything, before I move forward. If I could reduce that fear, it would be worth a lot to me.\n\n> to push a controversial patch like opt-in RBF, that has very little real-world benefits but comes with real costs and risks\n\nThere are lots of informed minds that disagree (including Garzik: "tl;dr Good stuff. It is "opt in" as implied."), so I fail to see how this is true. People will always disagree about things. It\'s about whether, on balance, something is good or not. I\'ve read enough to know there are plenty of people who think it\'s a good thing (very "benign" compared to what it could have been).\n\nEven BlockCypher thinks it\'s fine!

The average confirmation time is 7 min for each of the hypothetical 1,000 transactions, and that probability doesn\'t change for any particular transaction. So, on average, it\'s likely to be enough of a window for someone to quickly cancel, if needed.\n\n> Being the least bad solution does not make it something that should be implemented. Undoing transactions will have to be solved on a layer on top of the blockchain protocol level.\n\nSolved, how? What\'s the idea, where\'s the code, where\'s the proposal? My point is just that: unless we have something, this \'irreversible transaction\' nature of Bitcoin seems to be a major stumbling block on path to mass adoption. It frankly makes it a bit dangerous to use, for the average person, since there is no recourse if you make a mistake. If we have an opt-in solution that works, then it sounds like a good idea.\n\nBtw, Garzik endorsed it, too:\n\n* https://twitter.com/jgarzik/status/671271910634889216': 0, "[**@BlockCypher**](https://twitter.com/BlockCypher/)\r\n\r\n> [2015-11-27 20:14 UTC](https://twitter.com/BlockCypher/status/670334879565922304)\r\n\r\n> @TheBlueMatt thanks!

There is a "safe" variant of RBF, first-seen-safe RBF or FSS RBF, which would prohibit the sort of replacement you\'re talking about. It checks that all outputs still get paid the same amount or more in a replacement transaction, so no one gets cheated.\n\nThis sounds very nice until you realise that there\'s also a change address which you likely want to *decrease*. You could make an exception for one change address, which would be allowed to decrease, but that involves a privacy loss because you\'re now revealing which of the outputs is your change address.\n\nYou could also keep the rule that all outputs have to increase or stay the same, but then you need to add an additional input.

You just know that the one in a thousand transactions you want to undo will simply happen to confirm in less than a minute\n\nI don't know about that. That's speculation :). Like we said, the 'average' is 7-10 min; so probability dictates that there is a higher chance of 7-10 min confirmation time, rather than 'less than a minute'. Every single transaction in the hypothetical 1,000 txs will take on average 7-10 min.\n\nIt's not perfect, but it's certainly way, way, way better than having zero recourse as users do currently.\n\n> Opt-in RBF is a really bad solution to this problem\n\nWhat's a better solution?": 1, 'It can work if you: send funds to the wrong address by accident, and want an "undo" or "cancel" option (valid for average of ~10 minutes).\n\nOtherwise, the irreversible nature of a Bitcoin transaction can make it \'scary\' to use.

This could lead to further centralization of mining. Moreover, this is especially bad for Chinese miners, as you are behind \'the great firewall of China\'. Is this correct?\n\nAnd if that is correct, wouldn\'t you think that the Chinese miners would be at an advantage, while the miners *outside of China* are at a disadvantage? (After all, the miners inside China have a majority of hashing power. As such, you could argue that the miners *outside of China* are behind the great firewall of China.) Thoughts?"\n\nChun: "The Firewall of China may have impact on block propagation. I think the general poor routing in Asia may be more than that. For example, now from my 50/20Mbps AIS Fibre landline connection in Thailand, ping my server in Beijing takes 400 ms, but another TrueMove-H on my mobile phone takes just slightly over 100 ms. Sometimes data from Beijing to Hong Kong could be routed through U.S. West. Bluematt may have more info on this than me. I do not know if it leads to mining centralization, but this could give pools in China a minor advantage on orphan rate of course. I think it is fair, as we suffered the same high orphans back in 2013, when the U.S. and Europe still held major hashrate. Pools in the U.S. and Europe should find their own ways to improve connectivity to China. And the good news is we have better tools like the relay network right now.\n\nSome people may argue we can afford 20 MB block as they can be easily uploaded or downloaded within 10 minutes, the typical time between blocks. But in the real world, the block data has to be transferred within a couple of seconds instead of 10 minutes to make the orphan rate at a reasonable level. In the past few months, we have an average orphan rate of 0.3%. It could be doubled even if the propagation and verification time increases by just 2 seconds.\n\nNetwork propagation is one factor, but not the only one. Bigger blocks take longer CPU time to verify, larger disk space to store. As you may know, right now on an average computer, it usually takes a few days to fully sync a bitcoin node. If the block size increases by 20x, I don\'t know how much time it would take. So from this point of view, we are barely able to afford 1 MB block in 2015."': 4, 'If China create a copy cat of Bitcoin it will worth more than the actual Bitcoin.\n\nChinese prefer to adopt china made things, much like they use QQ instead of Skype !': 0, 'I assume you mean based on percentage of total btc one owns?

They estimated that by mid-2016, block size would reach congestion such that average TPS would be > 2.3 -- and that 2.3 TPS represents the level at which block confirmation time starts to exceed 1 block (a nice metric for practical limits of the network).

You snapshot the blockchain state at the point where the attack begins, then hard fork it to a new proof of work.  If the economic majority follows that fork then the value will follow as well.\n\nIt'd certainly be an unpleasant experience and there would be a significant hit to valuation (at least temporarily), but I highly doubt it would actually kill bitcoin, and if it does survive such an attack (albeit with some significant temporary inconveniences) then the resulting confidence in the network could be even higher than before since it has demonstrated it can deal with a 51% attack.

I\'ve heard arguments that are a bit antithetical to one another on the topic of effects of "free currency" injected into an economy.  On one side I\'ve heard arguments that putting money into a dying economy is bad, because it doesn\'t fix the primary problem of the "proper value of money"(not sure how to explain it better, at the moment), it would cause deflation (which can be healthy for the economy, but poor for the participants).  \n\nOn the other side people also say that if you let the economy die/fix itself, it will do more societal damage and cause more suffering, especially those who are less financially well off.  \n\nIt sounds like our educational background on economics is about the same, but I haven\'t really done too much reading on economics personally.  You are right especially that both are interesting because they\'re complex systems.  I grew up in a family that ran a small business, so I have some basic ideas about economic ideas.  And most of the analogies I use to try to explain the economy to people are using biological examples (ie., I believe that an economy is an ecology of sorts in itself.  And for example, if one is a business owner, one should know what food sources/animals/customer type one needs to "hunt").

It would be a stretch to say silver was 'alive,' but it was definitely more life-like than other metals. Silver's code is simple: 47 protons and 47 neutrons.  Its 'metabolism' was human hands and feet.  Silver is robust, but it has (as far as I know of) no feedback loops that made it antifragile.\n\nOn the other hand, bitcoin has a feedback loop that makes it antifragile: mining difficulty adjusts in order to maintain a predictable and confidence-inspiring one-confirmation-per-ten-minute 'heartbeat'. Bitcoin's metabolism is massive. It's powered by coal, hydro, nuclear, wind, solar, and probably more.

The business network in country B sucks - only 9 other people have money b to buy things.

I use it everyday and if I had to lug around gold and silver and assay and measure every coin and make change in copper pennies it would be a royal pain in the ass. Fiat is the best money the world can realistically use today. Bitcoin's code isn't ready to allow it to work as a worldwide money.  However, fiat has some massive flaws. IMO, its biggest flaw stems from the network effects that throned the US dollar as the world's pre-eminent money. The production of new US dollars is done at no cost by powerful americans.

I'm referring to the idea that governments tent to turn their money into fiat currency because there isn't enough of a particular asset to back up the money.  If you weren't aware, some time in our history the USD stopped being on the gold standard (when you could technically go to the bank and ask the bank for gold in exchange for your money (which I think was in Fort Knox at the time), so some people have been doomsayers, saying our USD is doomed, because civilizations like Rome used fiat currency and I think went into an economic depression which contributed to their downfall.\n\nI don't disagree with you that fiat currency has its advantanges, I wasn't advocating it.  I don't really know what's the best form of currency for people.  But if I haven't misunderstood fiat money, isn't it the idea that your money's value isn't based on gold or anything physical, the value is based on the government's promise that they'll give you something in exchange for your money.\n\nMy understanding of economy isn't that the Treasury can just print money for no cost to the economy.  It's difficult to make up value out of no where.  You can print more money, but the more you print and the less you have something to back up the value, the more the value of that currency drops (ie., inflation).  \n\nWhere did you get the idea that, >This means that, on average, money flows out of the US and real wealth flows out of every other country, into the US.\n\nIf that theory were true, why wouldn't wealth flow into any other economy when they print money?  Sorry if that doesn't make sense to me. ": 2, '> because country A monetary machine (ours is the FED/Treasure, the President, and Congress) has to have enough money supply in the money pool for an economy to move.\n\nI realize this is a common theory, but it is false. Merchants and buyers, and employers and employees are essentially free to agree on prices and wages. When a money becomes more precious, (which **was** the case for most of the history during which gold and silver were money,) prices and wages fall i.e deflation happens, but the economy would not slow down. Think about the converse situation: if the authorities decided to print and distribute $100 to every American, would this action spur the production of more cars, the building of more homes, or the growth of more food? No, the economy would not grow - the preciousness of money would simply decrease. \n\nIn fact, it\'s totally reasonable that an injection of new money would actually slow the economy: in order to rediscover the balance between supply and demand, energy would need to be directed to discovering new prices. If new prices were not discovered, shortages of goods and labour would occur. The energy spent on price discovery would otherwise be spent on creating real wealth, like cars or houses.\n\nI\'m glad I seem informed:) I took a couple classes in economics but my degree in Engineering Physics. Most of my ideas came through self-directed reading. Biology, and especially ecology, have a lot in common with economics: both deal with complex systems in many ways beyond our ability to comprehend.

": 1, "Well neither of those will happen this year or next.\n\nBitcoin doesn't need Visa level. The visa scale quoted figure of 2000 transactions per second is massively inaccurate because of geopolitical realities (compliance/SOX). Visa likely runs one set of mainframe computer per country, then collated daily for stats. The 2000 figure comes from annual worldwide total transactions (62Bn) from Visa + Mastercard divided by 365/24/60/60. If we divide this by population or by country to find a more accurate figure, we'll land at about 100-200 transactions per second per country (US taking the largest shares, Europe/Oceania taking the lower share)\n\nAdd in amex and the figure might be slightly higher, but in general it is a more realistic target. Let's guestimate 250 transactions per second. Well then we aren't far off by increasing the block size to about 90mb to support visa/mc/amex level on a per country basis. I forgot China Union Pay.\n\nThe reality is Bitcoin the tech only needs to be powerful enough, not the powerful. Altcoins have a purpose and no it isn't to spin off Bitcoin to create Litecoin and Dogecoin, it is also part of the formula for decentralisation and scalability. One country, one currency. Bitcoin only needs to be powerful enough to scale to a small country for it to become a reserve currency for the world. The dream that Bitcoin alone should support the entire world needs to be left behind us. Maybe in the next 20-40 years that could happen, but for the next 10 years, no. Not without the help of another layer like Lightning, which IMO only works great for subscription channels and not for payment. (Subs make up a tonne of our transactions - utilities, services, local council taxes, which all benefit from automation via Lightning and reducing clutter on the main network).": 2, 'also, 4 space and a line break will put a lin just under..\n\ne.g. now 2 line breaks\n\n\nnow 4 space and a line    \nline': 2, 'RemindMe! one year.': 1}}}
