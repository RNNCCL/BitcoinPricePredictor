Trustlessness is unlikely a feature that concerns them very much. But a distributed, cryptographically secure, publicly auditable(or private if they wanted that) immutable ledger, with no token of value since blocks can just be signed by participants, is likely a huge step up for an industry that still heavily relies on COBOL. \n\nDoes anything currently exist that provides that set of features in one package? It doesn't necessarily have to be a blockchain at all. People here say all they need is a database, but no one has been able to point to an existing data product that checks all the boxes that using a blockchain would provide. So for now I guess it's easy for them just to use the 'blockchain technology' buzzword, because it probably best describes what some people are looking for. It's just not Bitcoin. The two ideas are fundamentally different in that Bitcoin is truly decentralised, while it's likely that most organizations are going to want something semi-decentralised or distributed.

Reveal, a social media/cryptocurrency hybrid\n\nWith the possible exception of the last company, which isn\'t specifically related to Bitcoin, imagine any one of these becoming a monopoly. Is Bitcoin better or worse off as a result?\n\nOr look at it from another angle: what can any of these companies possibly do to become monopolies, rather than a grinding exploration of marginal costs? How do those things affect the usability, security, and privacy of using Bitcoin?\n\nIt seems investors have a choice: \n\n- set the "startup-shaped" problem aside and assume it will eventually work itself out; or\n- keep looking for those Bitcoin companies solving problems that are startup-shaped\n\nEdit: there\'s a third option as well:\n\n1.

[Federal Reserve Notes](http://usrarecurrency.com/WebPgFl/AG12345687H/1996$20FederalReserveNoteSnAG12345687H.jpg), the official name for the paper money in the United States (it says so right at the top front), are issued by Federal Reserve Banks.  They are delivered to local member banks in return for collateral, such as treasury bonds mortgage-backed securities.\n\nIf you look at the Fed's [balance sheet](http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h41/Current/) - Table 5 and 5 (continued), you can see that the Assets side is mostly Treasury (2.461 trillion) and Mortgage Backed (1.743 trillion) securities.  On the liabilities side are Federal Reserve Notes (1.325 trillion).  Thus the paper money (which is a debt of the Fed) is backed by other debts (treasuries and MBS).  Those in turn are backed by the ability of the US government to collect taxes, and real estate.\n\nSo US money is backed by the assets of the Federal Reserve Bank, which bitcoin is not.  Why issue paper money in the first place?  It is inconvenient to pay for your coffee at Starbucks with a Treasury Bond or Mortgage Backed Security.  They are too large (generally $1000 or more), and because they earn interest, their market value at any given moment is variable.  Paper money comes in convenient small units, and are non-interest bearing, so their value is easy to figure out.  ": 11, "Let me clarify.  Treasury bonds have different maturities, and bear different interest rates.  So two T-bonds with the same face value will not have the same market value.  Whereas two $20 Federal Reserve Notes will have the same market value in terms of what they can buy at any one time.  If you have two in your wallet, it doesn't matter which one you use.\n\nBack before the Federal Reserve existed (<1917), individual banks issued bank notes based on their assets and loans.  Since banks varied in distance and quality, their notes would be discounted a variable amount other than in their own town at their own office.  So paper money was not spendable at face value if it wasn't local.  When the Fed came into being, it simplified long-distance commerce, because now all currency was accepted at face value everywhere.

Most of the money supply is backed by debt.  If the debt is paid off, the money supply would have to contract.  Interest doesn't accumulate when it's paid.  I earn interest by way of a corporate bond fund, but then I spend it.  That includes paying down a mortgage.

Those were issued to the Fed by the Treasury department, when they confiscated all the nation\'s gold.  \n\nIn theory, those certificates are for the gold the Treasury now has in their bullion depositories, like Fort Knox.  In practice, the certificates are not likely to be redeemed, ever (they haven\'t so far), and the Fed can\'t trade them to anyone else.  So they are probably worthless paper.

Banks buy Treasury bonds on the open market in the course of their business, and deposit them as collateral for paper money as needed to supply teller windows and ATMs.\n\nThe Treasury does have an account at the Fed.  When I pay the IRS, I make the check out to the US Treasury (which the IRS is part of).  The check ends up as a credit on that account.  When the US government pays someone, it comes out of that account.  That\'s how the US government connects with the rest of the financial system.\n\n> Fed therefore can issue more Fed notes. \n\nThe Fed doesn\'t issue paper money on their own.

At the moment, she can sell her bitcoins on Argentina\xe2\x80\x99s unofficial currency market for 50 per cent more than she would get at the official exchange rate.\n\nThe prolonged use of capital controls in Argentina since 2011 has wreaked havoc for businesses operating in South America\xe2\x80\x99s second-largest economy \xe2\x80\x94 not only restricting access to foreign currency and leading to a heavily overvalued official exchange rate, but also exacerbating economic stagnation and double-digit inflation.\n\nUnder the leftist government of President Cristina Fern\xc3\xa1ndez, no immediate change is expected in Argentina\xe2\x80\x99s complicated economic conditions, which have seen the use of bitcoin more than double over the past year, mainly among small businesses. This represents much faster growth than elsewhere in Latin America, according to bitex.la, a regional bitcoin exchange.\n\nRecent raids on currency trading houses and new powers for the national spy agency to prevent speculative attacks pushed the peso\xe2\x80\x99s black market value this week to its lowest levels since Argentina defaulted last year on its foreign debt for the second time this century.\n\nOn a cruise round the Mediterranean, Domingo Cavallo, Argentina\xe2\x80\x99s economy minister in the run-up to the country\xe2\x80\x99s dramatic economic collapse in 2001, was bemused when he was unable to use his credit card during a brief stop-off on Greek soil last week.\n\nHowever, presidential elections in October are expected to bring in a more market-friendly administration, and investors hope that untangling capital controls will be one of the top priorities for the new government. That has triggered a heated debate over how to defuse a situation that has caused an investment drought in Argentina.\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs always happens with such controls, it is much more complicated getting rid of them than it is putting them in place,\xe2\x80\x9d says Jos\xc3\xa9 Luis Espert, an Argentine economist.\n\nThe two leading candidates advocate sharply differing methods. Daniel Scioli, the one-armed governor of Buenos Aires province backed by Ms Fern\xc3\xa1ndez, favours a more gradual approach, although there is growing concern that his government ties will limit his room for manoeuvre.\n\nMauricio Macri, the centre-right mayor of the city of Buenos Aires, backed by the markets, prefers a more immediate solution.\nAlthough Mr Espert also recommends a swift removal of capital controls, he says it must be accompanied by a \xe2\x80\x9ctechnically solid economic plan\xe2\x80\x9d that inspires strong confidence in the markets. \xe2\x80\x9cWithout a credible plan, shock treatment can be just as damaging as a more gradual approach,\xe2\x80\x9d he warns.\n\nJos\xc3\xa9 Urtubey, vice-president of the Argentine Industrial Union (UIA), a powerful business chamber, doubts that shock therapy will work. Although capital controls played a big part in a 2.6 per cent contraction in Argentina\xe2\x80\x99s industrial sector last year \xe2\x80\x94 foreign currency is essential to import materials needed for industrial production \xe2\x80\x94 he fears that central bank reserves could not withstand the pressure on the currency generated by the controls\xe2\x80\x99 sudden removal. \xe2\x80\x9cThe remedy could be worse than the illness,\xe2\x80\x9d he says.\nAs always happens with such controls, it is much more complicated getting rid of them than it is putting them in place\n- Jos\xc3\xa9 Luis Espert, Argentine economist\n\nSuch resistance to change explains why Mr Espert believes that Argentina\xe2\x80\x99s volatile economy has for the past half century been stuck in a \xe2\x80\x9cvicious triangle\xe2\x80\x9d, whose vertices are crisis, followed by a rebound and then mediocrity \xe2\x80\x94 which every decade or so leads to another crisis.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSoon there will be another one,\xe2\x80\x9d he says, pointing to a lack of consensus over how to fix the country\xe2\x80\x99s serious macroeconomic imbalances, especially a gaping fiscal deficit, which he fears will lead to more mediocrity. \xe2\x80\x9cArgentina finds it very difficult to escape that triangle. We are afflicted by a kind of [economic] Stockholm syndrome,\xe2\x80\x9d he says.\nIf the future of Argentina\xe2\x80\x99s economy is as gloomy as Mr Espert fears, that would be good news for bitcoin, which is still in its infancy in Argentina, with only about 6,000-8,000 users.\n\nFranco Daniel Amati, a co-founder of Bitcoin Argentina, a kind of embassy for bitcoin in the heart of the Buenos Aires financial district, is optimistic about prospects for the digital currency in a country where still only half the population entrust their money to the formal banking system.\n\xe2\x80\x9cA recurring inflation crisis, capital controls and overall financial repression make life very difficult in Argentina. More and more people here are looking for ways to get around these problems, and bitcoin is the perfect solution,\xe2\x80\x9d he says.\n': 18}, ('10 VC Firms Betting Big on Bitcoin and the Blockchain', 0): {}, ('Display Bitcoin node information via web?', 13): {"* Install Apache on the server where you run your node\n* Install [Python interface to bitcoin's JSON-RPC API](https://github.com/jgarzik/python-bitcoinrpc)\n* Download the [btc-update.py](http://pastebin.com/wKytLZmc) script anywhere on your server\n* Run a new cron job:\n    crontab -e\n     */5 * * * * python /your_path/btc-update.py\n* Test your node web page: http://your_node_ip\n\n ": 1, 'Here is how I like to check on mine!\n\n\nhttps://getaddr.bitnodes.io/nodes/71.212.25.139-8333/\n\nhttps://blockchain.info/ip-address/71.212.25.139\n\nhttps://getaddr.bitnodes.io/nodes/leaderboard/?q=71.212.25.139': 6, 'Something like this? http://162.220.12.165/\n\nI will send you a PM with details...': 1, "All credit to /u/statoshi, but is this what you're looking for?:  \n\nhttps://statoshi.info/  \n\nhttps://jlopp.github.io/statoshi/": 3, "I think you're looking for this: https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/2zexq0/my_php_bitcoin_node_status_page/": 1}, ('Could Bitcoin help prevent the censorship like that of all the comments that is happening in the top post of r/Documentaries right now?', 3): {'Presumably the video referred to this: \nhttp://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/specialseries/2014/10/day-israel-attacked-america-20141028144946266462.html\n\nAlbeit about something that occured in 1967?': 1, '[deleted]': 4, 'God that first pic ....

I don't understand this idea that in order for BTC to succeed, people need to go out of their way to spend it and then rebuy. It isn't as though gold is worth over $1000 because people are going around spending it. It is worth that much simply because people are willing to buy it for that much. Bitcoin is exactly the same. There are numerous motivations to buy bitcoin. For some, it may be in order to be able to spend it. But there are certainly others who are interested in buying and holding. There is absolutely no reason to encourage people to stop doing what they want to do.

The more people demand to hold them, the more upward pressure there will be on price. And the higher the price, the more interest there will be (see: every bubble since 2009). So one could argue that the actual best thing for bitcoin is to buy and hold, and to spend only if you truly *have* to, but to make all other transactions in fiat. Then again, I wouldn't be arrogant enough to tell people what to do with their money. Every transaction has a buyer and a seller, and I am humble enough to see that each one has reasons for doing what they do. I don't need to preach to them about their financial decisions.\n\nNow, I agree that more people might be willing to buy in if more merchants accepted it, and more merchants would accept if people would use it more.

It\'s the buyer.\n\nThe buyer held bitcoin (either for a long time, as is much more frequently the case tbh, or for a short period only to come in via this entrance for some reason) and then the buyer sold off their bitcoin to get a good or service. *that* is the sales pressure, pure and simple.\n\nThat also puts the currency value back under the consumer\'s control. If you don\'t want to "sell off" your bitcoin for a good or service, then just match your purchase with a re-buy of Bitcoin. how much is that to ask of you? Hold your own god damned bag instead of getting upset at others for not taking a bag off of your hands.\n\nSo instead, I would view a merchant using a payment processor as an inarguably *good* alternative to a merchant not touching bitcoin: they are offering a new way for Bitcoin holders to trade their currency just as "directly" for a good or a service as any paypal or credit card transaction does. And then I would view merchants holding some percentage of their bitcoin sales as simply the next step of support: the merchant *Buying Bitcoin* via the revenues they rely on to stay in business!\n\nI think this is an important perspective to maintain, because otherwise lay-readers begin to start actively hating on merchants who convert back to fiat as though they are some kinds of traitors and thus *worse* than not accepting Bitcoin at all. ;P': 9, 'Terrible analogy.

When I first heard about regenerative breaking, it was hydraulic. The breaking mechanism pumped oil into a pressurized canister, increasing it\'s pressure, and then when you began to go again the canister\'s pressure drove some kind of a turbine that directly forced the axle back into motion. The tech patents got bought up by big oil and sat on for forty years.\n\nThen came the Prius, the first electric car I am aware of to revive the regenerative breaking concept. But do they keep the mechanical energy mechanical? No, they attach a generator to the axle to break, converting mechanical energy into electricity, which gets sent to a battery, and then drawn back out again to run a DC motor when you want to go again. The heat losses involved at every step are *simply monumental* compared to hydraulic, but that\'s still what becomes the commercial success.\n\nThe same rather obtuse "send everything to the same ground state" approach may easily pervade business decisions relating to Bitcoin.

The "feminist" activism is not about being "already empowered" as sex workers, since clearly there are many problems that we are struggling against. It\'s about working towards better conditions and changing these existing problems. The sex workers who are most fiercely organized around fighting existing problems are not the North American "happy hooker feminists," a strawman trope often used to discredit "privileged" sex workers as being "unrepresentative" of the ones who are working in worse conditions. Actually, the best organized and most politically effective sex worker activists are the ones working in the worst conditions in India (<a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durbar_Mahila_Samanwaya_Committee"> 650,000 sex workers </a> who have created their own credit union and retirement programs), Thailand and Cambodia (who have organized together to pass laws to fight human trafficking, violence, and exploitation in their trades) - as well as some immigrants and street-based people in the sex trades who are the most marginalized in first world countries. The fact that these people are interested in the potential of Bitcoin for accessing BP ads, improving safety, anonymity, and better control over their work - and that **these** are the people actively seeking and organizing trainings for Bitcoin - is in itself, a promising example of "sex worker feminism," strength, and resourcefulness.\n\nThis presentation has a feminist bend because at least two of the people leading it are sex worker feminists. You can disagree with the politics, and choose to see it without a gendered angle, but bitcoin has many underlying political values, including the ones you expressed. You can insist on keeping this a "neutral" topic about financial censorship only, and not about gender, but we believe the reason that this work is censored is because of sexism, prudish values rooted in marriage (eg historic male ownership of their wives\' bodies as property and asymmetrical requirements of "chastity"), as well as a general lack of respect for one of the ways that women have always supported themselves financially.\n\nAgreed: these points hold regardless of sex/gender - there are also plenty of sex workers who are not cis-women. Hopefully Tony\'s slideshow is useful, regardless of politics. However, given the nature of this very passionate and dedicated team, it would be inappropriate to repress the values felt so strongly by the organizers.\n\nThanks also for your note about Pax.

Once you have bitcoin, you can use any service on earth hosted from any location on the globe including tor hidden services to exchange that back and forth for whatever alt you\'d like. To trade fiat for a crypto however, it\'s going to be tons easier to find somebody buying or selling Bitcoin than it is "experimental coin number 587". Also, once it\'s time to purchase goods or services with your wealth, some people take Bitcoin directly and some will cash you back out to the local fiat but nobody\'s going to trade either for the pegged crypto.. so Bitcoin is the go-between again.\n\nAs for holding traditional currencies directly instead of a crypto, well, it\'s not a crypto. That means you\'re not going to be able to purchase anything over the internet, it\'s easier to get rolled by law enforcement (in the US we used to joke about Mexican Federales doing this to tourists, but then we got Civil Asset Forfeiture and the joke was on us..) because while they *could* theoretically jail you and harrass you and extort you in various ways to get you to give up a password to your crypto-fortune, that\'s way more work (and way harder for corrupt assholes to get away with unnoticed) than going next door and taking all of your neighbor\'s cash instead or freezing people\'s bank accounts on a whim. So against that adversary, it\'s at least on par with locking your car door. Sure it can be jimmied, but the next car down is probably unlocked so all things being equal, most crooks will just pass you by.\n\nThe object lesson here is that crypto-currencies give you the power and the safety to do these things (so long as you invest the right attention into infosec, or trust the right infosec partners, of course)  but Bitcoin remains the king of cryptocurrencies (until Blockstream finds ways to ruin it and drive everyone to another alt, at least) due to network effects and adoption.

You do not start by finding excuses to hold, you start by finding utility. And even being a middle-man currency most people only hold for a short time *is* an example of utility.\n\nAll of the payment processors and local traders and infrastructure that supports (and thus profits from) all of this trading back and forth to bitcoin? Yeah, *they* have to hold enough balance to maintain liquidity and potentially even to compete with one another.\n\nThus, every transient bitcoin holder is at least *responsible* for the infrastructure they use being pressured to more permanently hold bitcoin reserves in order to keep earning money off of them.\n\nThis is by far not the only mechanism bitcoin is involved in, of course. But it is *additive*.\n\nEvery positive way that Bitcoin gets used (and for every one of them, pools of Bitcoin must be held by somebody to maintain liquidity..) *combines* to increase it\'s ambient utility along with it\'s durable value floor. Plus every sustainable utility Bitcoin picks up never has to go away. Remittance today? Keep remitting tomorrow while new services flourish. Black market today? Keep trading in secret tomorrow while still more use cases get found.\n\nIt may not look like "it only gets better" because of all the false BS like pirateat40 pyramid schemes and MtGox malfeasance that falls by the wayside, and because of all of the worrisome glitches like Mar 2013 hard fork or July 2015 malfunctioning mining pool soft fork that we survive, but when you only measure the things that weren\'t bullshit to begin with and you consider that a challenge *survived* makes us stronger, then yeah.\n\nJust like the lives of the lion\'s share of human beings: it only gets better. :3': 3, 'In a world where Bitcoin has been adopted there is no such thing as capital controls.

(see u/jgarzik\'s recent BIP), which would double the limit to 6 TPS. We are averaging 1.5 TPS (of real demand) these days, so 6 TPS may represent a ceiling that lets us buy enough time until Lightning is ready. Recently, u/rustyreddit proposed a new way to achieve Lightning that, in the inventor\'s (Poon\'s) words, will allow Lightning to be deployed "*much* sooner" (https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3dn1q0/creator_of_lightning_network_on_rustys_new_draft/). I don\'t know how to quantify that to a specific timeframe, but it seems like Lightning would be ready before 6 TPS becomes a problem.\n\nAlso, to emphasize, Lightning (according to Poon) allows unlimited transactions per user -- i.e. 50,000,000 users for 1MB block size, 100,000,000 for 2MB block size, etc. This is in contrast to simply increasing block size without Lightning, which only increases the number of transactions supported (e.g. 1MB = 250,000 transactions/day at 3 TPS... maybe we can assume 10 transactions/active user/day, which means ~25,000 active users supported with 1MB block size). Thus, we can estimate that Lightning grants a 2,000x scalability improvement.\n\nIn reality, when it becomes possible for the network to handle unlimited transactions for a given number of users, then new use cases will become feasible (like microtransactions, e.g. paying 0.1 cents per WSJ article), which would mean Lightning ends up increasing scalability by far more than 2,000x.': 5, 'In our efforts to help spread mass adoption, we have now deployed and are running 8 ATMs for users to purchase BTC with physical cash; with 5 of them being 2-way ATMs capable of dispensing cash, too.\n\n6 are located in NYC and 2 in Cali (Irvine & Garden Grove: both 2-way)\n\nOur machines are always happy to continue providing assistance to all users of Funky Fiat as they transition into the Perfect Payment Protocol, Badass Bitcoin..': 10, "A coinbase account isn't using Bitcoins though,  its using an intermediary.
