The solid rocket boosters were designed to operate between 45 and 95F, which comfortably covers the normal temperature range in Cocoa Beach, Florida.  The temperature range is right on the spec sheet for the rockets, because lots of other things besides O-rings are a function of temperature.  A couple of examples:\n\n* The motor casings are made out of steel, which expands and shrinks with temperature.  The SRB's are attached to the External Tank, which does *not* change size, because it's filled with cryogenic fuels at a fixed temperature, that overwhelms any outside temperature changes.  Excessive temperature changes would put a strain on the structure that connects the SRBs to the External Tank.\n\n* The burn rate of solid rocket fuel is a function of bulk temperature.  The hotter it is, the faster it burns.  If it's too cold, you may not get enough thrust to complete the mission.\n\nSo the problem was well beyond ignoring warnings from engineers.  It was operating the hardware out of spec, specifically 32% below the lower temperature limit (in terms of a 50 degree range).  If you operate equipment out of spec, it can break, because it wasn't designed for it.

For example, it is hard to agree on the history without agreeing on the rules.  And it is hard to believe in the value of a Bitcoin if participants cannot even agree on who owns which Bitcoin...\n\n---\n\n\nSomething which isn\'t stated by the authors but seems obvious to me is that we have decentralized "solutions" for the first and second consensus. Free market (exchanges, ...) is used to find a consensus about the value of bitcoin, and the Nakamoto\'s consensus allows to find a consensus about the valid chain of blocks.\n\n\nRemains the consensus about the rules. A decentralized solution has still to be invented but it\'s likely that it will be a very hard job. Some may think that a voting system (aka democracy) is a good solution but imho it\'s not. Because the matters are not just about ideologies or personal choices but are also technical. I mean, as a member of the bitcoin community, I\'m all in for allowing all kind of transactions without any censorship. I don\'t care if you pay for a house, for a second of video on streamium or if you\'re just a spammer. But as a developer, I know this is just a bad choice because it\'s technically impossible with current (and near future) technologies.\n\n\nFor months, we have all struggled with a same problem and it\'s not the blocksize limit, it\'s the absence of this decentralized mechanism allowing the social consensus. May be worse, weeks after weeks, we have started (collectively) to damage the fragile consensus which existed and which is required to keep bitcoin alive (see previous quote from the authors).\n\n\nBitcoin has a scalability problem and this problem won\'t happen in one year, it\'s happening now. It\'s the consensus about the rules which doesn\'t scale today, not the consensus about the state.\n\n\nIt\'s unlikely that someone will come up tomorrow with a decentralized solution for this problem. Until this "miracle" happens, we should all do our best to preserve the system as a whole.

They used http instead of https, so the random numbers were sent to you in the clear where anyone snooping could read. 2. They disabled a feature called re-directing... After a while, random.org disabled random number generating over http and required everyone to access over SSL encrypted https. Once random.org stopped supporting http, they sent a RE-DIRECT to the device, but the wallet app had disabled redirects for some reason, so they would use the message "THIS IS A REDIRECT YOU DUMMY" in place of the random numbers, because the redirect message itself is the only data they would receive.

Median block sizes therefore increase and the limit will increase.  Industry wide fees decline and the equilibrium difficulty may be too low.

He\'s described his patch as "kicking the can down the road", but he\'s also described his patch as "eventually able to handle visa-like transaction numbers on regular PCs"\n\nThere are three major issues at hand:\n\n1. Does a high block limit hurt the formation of the prophesied fee market that is meant to replace the block reward? The argument goes: it increases the supply of transactions, which should have a depressing effect on the price of said transactions.\n2. Does a low block limit hurt the usability of the network by forcing people into side channeled versions of bitcoin, splitting up and weakening the nascent and hard fought merchant ecosystem that exists today?\n3. Does a high block limit hurt the decentralized defense of Bitcoin, its ability to resist censorship and control by being split into resilient peer to peer nodes that route around damage by increasing the cost to run a node and therefore potentially the supply of nodes?\n\nThe problem with all these questions is that they have no clear answers, answering them requires predicting future things that are based on many complex factors. That makes it seem like the best way to solve this problem is to either go to the farthest extreme and "over solve" by eliminating the block limit variable or "under solve" and try to avoid any change. \n\nMike Hearn has rallied for "over solve". This says basically, "let\'s take the brakes off, if we go too slow we die anyway so let\'s not worry about that."\n\nCore devs are put in the default position of "under solve" and they are trying to find any way to avoid predicting the future consequences of change, with the idea that "Bitcoin must last the ages, even if the growth part fails"\n\nSince these are irreconcilable viewpoints, there will never be a way to find consensus between them, which suggests two coins. However I imagine that there is a happy middle ground that would capture most sides. The Bitcoin ecosystem is already extremely imperfectly formed, as evidenced by the heretical quips of core devs about how SPV and zero-conf transactions and all the messy hacks that have been formed to make Bitcoin more usable in practice. That makes me think that the purists would give ground, although unhappily.

Either the market chooses a side and values coins on that fork with a high price and coins on the other fork with an insignificant price, relegating it to the dustbin, or - though I think extremely unlikely due to the market's high valuation of network effects - the market gives both versions substantial value and we get a split. \n\nSince I personally trust the market, I can only conclude that this unlikely situation would be one where the benefits of the split somehow actually outweigh the costs (such as if Bitcoin turns out to need to divide into an extremely decentralized settlement network and a less-decentralized payment network). \n\nEither way, it is not a bad situation provided you trust that the market mechanism is the wisest one. And even if you don't, the market always has the last word, vetoing anything it doesn't like and supporting whatever it does like, by changing the prices. \n\nSo I believe we are in a situation where any fork introduced will be fine because the market will choose wisely on it, and even if the market cannot be trusted to choose wisely there is nothing to be done about it anyway. For example, many may fear that the market will support a huge block fork and sell off coins in the small block fork so much that the price of coins in the small block fork falls below, say, a penny. If that were to happen, no one can do anything about it from a technical angle. All they can do if they want to stick with small blocks is to  hodl those small block coins, sell their coins in the mega-block fork, and hope mega-block Bitcoin meets an unfortunate security calamity, in which case they stand to make incredible amounts of money as the market realizes its mistake. \n\nPoint is, the market is always right, and even when the market is wrong it is always in control - and it doesn't operate by consensus but by popularity weighted by how much people really care and how certain they feel (and how right they've been in the past, insofar as wealth is a proxy for that).\n\nEDIT: However, our views may be closer than they appear, inasmuch as it could be argued that the market will value consensus most highly. I think the contribition I make here is to point out that the market will move forward with the option it deems most valuable even if no real consensus can be reached in time. I think the market will prefer to wait for consensus while it judges the situation not to be urgent, but once it decides the situation is urgent it will go forward with a value convergence on its preferred fork, with or without any particular standard of consensus having been reached. (Of course if the consensus is completely lacking *and* people feel strongly enough about it *and* a split is really deemed as the best way to maximize value, the market will support a split.)

If I were to dictate to the developers what they should do I would ask first that they not violate the security of Bitcoin. An important component of Bitcoin is trustlessness, without it, we might as well drop the blockchain and pick up a more efficient system. There are other goals one might have like "does this keep Bitcoin cheap" or "is this what Satoshi said he wanted", however I don\'t see the point of achieving these goals if loss of trustlessness is the cost.\n\nGeneral mining situation:\n\n* So does increasing the blocksize put trustlessness in jeopardy? Like most things in security it isn\'t black and white. The mining ecosystem becomes less secure and more centralized when there is a larger network load. It is a reaction that is caused by the cost of supporting the networks security becoming greater than its benefits. For example, every mining pool member could effectively take the control back from the pool and generate their own blocks, causing a huge decrease in the trust we are required to put in these pools. There is, however, a cost to these individual miners running a full node including additional latency for the pool users, additional resources for the pool if they are using the relay network, and many many other factors that increase as the block size increases.\n\nBenefits to big miners:\n\n* This isn\'t limited to individual miners in pools either, a certain Chinese mining pool was not validating blocks due to the stales that would be caused, though this can be improved partially with IBLT. The cause of the pool not validating was that their geographic separation from other mining pools made it more expensive to mine fully validating. It actually is very efficient to have all your miners in a geographically centralized area, like a single warehouse, and it becomes even more efficient as the network load increases. In general, as blocks become bigger there is a centralizing effect to the mining ecosystem and that causes the requirement of trust, the antithesis of Bitcoin.\n\nGetting small miners to run full nodes:\n\n* I usually get responses like "These miners can afford to run full nodes", but the question isn\'t whether they can run full nodes, it is whether they will! At what point does a miner benefit from a full node? A 0.1% miner may realize that the expenses of running a full node cut into their profits by 5%, and then through a rough estimate realize that their 0.1% of hash power belonging to a large mining pool doesn\'t harm the network, and by extension them that much. This leads to them not running a full node. The minimal hash power required for "profitable" validation varies based on factors including the loss of profit through latency caused by geographic placement, the gain in personal "profit" through the enjoyment that comes from running a full node as a hobby. However, as a general trend, the minimal hash power someone will run a full node at decreases and the cost of a full node increases.\n\nDecreasing attack cost with higher network load: \n\n* At this point, this economy of scale induced effect has led to miners being massive, the largest two miners individually can both reverse a confirmation with 40% probability of success. Combined, they can reverse 6 confirmations with 75% success. This is quite dangerous considering that a single government may attack Bitcoin relatively cheaply, or a profit-seeking miner may decide to attack as we have seen before with the 3000BTC GHash.io theft.\n\nIncreasing attack benefit with higher network load:\n\n* One of the main differences between a miner attacking an SPV-using merchant and a full-node-using merchant is the ability to forge money out of thin air that can\'t be spent in a reorg. If you, an economical and malicious miner, want to rip off a merchant running a full node, you need to send them YOUR (or your partners) money and **then** spend your hashing power (money) attempting to steal their money. When you rip off a merchant running an SPV node, you can create money out of thin air, create invalid blocks, then be guaranteed that your payment will be reversed. There is no up front cost other than the electricity of your mine and you can block withhold to make your attack much more likely to succeed than the reorg attack mentioned in the full node example. In short, many SPV nodes make miner attacks much more profitable and likely to succeed. But it\'s not like full nodes don\'t have to be worried, they too can be caught up in the attack because including a full node target in the attack doesn\'t cost additional mining resources. The number of full nodes online doesn\'t matter nearly as much as the number and fraction of merchants validating payments with full nodes.\n\nConclusion:\n\n* We must consider this centralizing effect caused by large blocks and work towards making mining decentralized and the ecosystem safer by reducing the system load. This can be accomplished by having the blocksize increase at a rate lower than the rate at which hardware and software changes decrease the expenses caused by block size.': 19, "Pools don't need to be centralized.

The main thing to avoid is promoting hard forks without consensus due to the inherent danger in doing so.\n\n/u/coblee made a superb post on the [importance of consensus](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3hp190/charlie_lee_nuclear_option_of_forking_the/) a couple days ago and I encourage everyone to read his whole post.\n\n>BitcoinXT is set to trigger with 75% miner support. This means it can trigger with only 50% miner support + a lucky streak. Or if there are malicious people running NoXT, they can cause the trigger to go off without majority support. When that happens, there's no guarantee that the losing side will all switch to running BitcoinXT. Now you've got a split user base and miner base. Some wallets will support BTC, some will support BTCXT, and some may support both. Same for exchanges and payment processors. It's going to be total chaos. Miners will switch back and forth between mining BTC and BTCXT. Users will send transactions on one network and not know why the recipient didn't get it. The price for both coins will tank. If you thought Litecoin and altcoins dilute the value of Bitcoin, wait til you see what BTCXT does to the price! Actually, the market is already giving us a hint as to why BitcoinXT is such a bad idea.\n\n>A more responsible option would have been to set the trigger threshold at a real super majority of 90% miner vote. If it was set at 90%, the chance of a bad fork would be far less likely. But Mike & Gavin knows that there's no way they can get 90% support, so they would rather risk hurting Bitcoin in order to get their way. Mike has even mention using checkpoints to force the issue if XT doesn't get the hashrate majority (https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1089283.0). That is scary.\n\n>There's a better option. Really try to reach consensus. Unlike what you have been told, the devs actually support increasing the block size. They just couldn't come to a consensus on how much and when. And we still have plenty of time to get to a consensus. Next month, most of the devs and bitcoin experts are gathering in Montreal to discuss this topic to get everyone on the same page. Check out https://scalingbitcoin.org/montreal2015/": 4, 'I see. Sorry for the misunderstanding.': 1, 'Of course panicky xt haters are downvoting rational replies ': 1, "Let them argue their case. I'm not afraid of people attempting to change the fundamental aspects of the protocol, because I take it as a fundamental assumption, just as Bitcoin itself does, that the majority of the network will work to maintain the value of the coin and not to destroy it. If such a scenario were to happen, it certainly wouldn't be moderator censorship or repository commit rights that protect against it. If those are what you believe are protecting the network from such changes, you should sell out of Bitcoin immediately because they are both easily routed around.\n\nEdit: Remember that they would have to do more than control 51% of the hash power. They'd have to convince merchants to change their nodes etc. because if they are violating the rules of existing nodes, they will be ignored by those nodes.": 2, 'Funny, 9,500 people in another sub seem to be able to discuss these topics in a calm, respectful and constructive manner without the need for crafting the discussion according to the desires of a select few. People always talk about how it is vital for there to be a free and open press in order for people to make informed choices in society, especially in politics. But you want to create a means for strong power brokers to form that can make backroom deals and selectively feed which information is OK for the masses to digest and which information is too controversial.\n\nI get real tired of this "consensus" BS and the fact that a bunch of developers *must all agree* first. It is this very act that is choking Bitcoin development to death. Development is utterly centralised and only a select few can actually enact change, thus making it easy to form cliques, build tight alliances, cement dependence on one and only one piece of software and more easily act according to their own self interest, rather than the community\'s. What the developers want has absolutely no bearing on which piece of Bitcoin software is running, yet development is so utterly centralised now that people are completely dependent on one piece of software. There is absolutely no opportunity for the Bitcoin community to defy developer consensus and get what THEY want. Miners and users, not developers, decide which piece of software gets run and adopted, the developers should be absolutely powerless to defy the community\'s wishes but without alternatives there is simply no other way of changing itself. Constructing this imaginary scenario where developers have to agree and have to work together and have to compromise first is an utter lie. \n\nWhat happens if those couple dozen developers got jailed? Lost in a plane crash? How is Bitcoin development going to progress if there is no one else to fall back on, no other segmented Bitcoin developers to pick up the pieces or turn to? Or, hint hint, when a large number of them become co-opted by special interests, or are found to be on the take to sabotage Bitcoin from the inside? If people become dependent on one single group of developers, then Bitcoin as a decentralised piece of software is utterly fucked as it has now created for itself it\'s single point of failure. If you honestly believe what you are saying then you are actively sabotaging Bitcoin\'s decentralised nature. We don\'t need "consensus" of a couple dozen people all gathered round a single code repository, we only need the *consent* of the Bitcoin community.\n\nStop interfering.\n\nEd: I\'d also like to add something that is also quite telling. Do you remember BIP16/17 and the furore it caused? How the devs were split down the middle? Luke-JR , even though his changes were on the losing side, defied the dev group at the time and compiled and released his own version of the Bitcoin client, angering the devs in the process because "the majority had spoken" he thought his version was the correct one and left it to the community to decide. And you know what? He was fucking right, his version WAS better, *superior* in fact in retrospect, neither version had "consensus" after all yet the changeover still happened. "consensus" is a bullshit word, designed to stop development in it\'s tracks and damage the development process so it can be easily manipulated with politicking and scheming.': 10, 'Headers-first is possible at all BECAUSE PoW can be validated from headers alone\n\nAnything wrong on the block invalidates the whole thing. The block with header is either valid or invalid ': 1, 'It seems to me that a modest fee market makes sense at any size. Consider: if the standard transaction fee is nominal (or may be seen as nominal to a large transaction), then even an order of magnitude or more increase can make sense in order to increase the likelihood of a quick confirmation (by increasing the likelihood of being included in the next block and increasing the incentive for producing the next block (the latter being a rather small effect in Bitcoin where the hashing power is relatively fixed in magnitude between blocks)).\n\nA lot of it is also the ratio between the typical block reward and the typical fee. If the fees start exceeding the block reward, then they are of course a bigger factor. But transaction fees today are far smaller than the block reward, so, yes, they are *less* relevant, just not totally irrelevant.\n\nBut I\'m just being very broad-minded on what a "fee market" means: to me, bitcoin *already* is operating with one: miners are free to prioritize high-fee transactions (and would be rather foolish not to), and there are examples of various transactions which have been done with higher-than-necessary fees in an apparent attempt to increase quality of service. So despite a lack of widespread adoption, bitcoin *has* a fee market.': 2, 'Are you arguing that current mining centralisation are due to the actual blocksize?\n\nYou know that sending you hash to a mining pool provide you with more stable income..\nThis only is the main cause of centralisation: convinience,\n\nSolo mining without a really significant amount of hash power you wil have wait quite some time to get your block reward..\nFor 1Th/s it will take four months to get a block.\n\nAnd one a side node bandwidth cost are negligeable compare to the ASIC investement to get into mining nowaday.': 1, '> for people to meet\n\nDoes that mean the dev team that do actually work on Bitcoin or is that any Tom, Dick and Harriet that have some sort of opinion about something they hardly understand.\n\nI rather have the techie guys/dev team that know what they are talking about, meeting and coming up with a decision or a work plan instead of "people" giving pointless opinions and speculations  and making it harder than it really is.\n\nEdit: Found the answer :)\n\n- WHO SHOULD ATTEND -\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2Engineers (related areas of expertise)\n\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2Academics with research in related areas\n\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2Journalists affiliated with technical publications\n': 3, ">it isn't that expensive to get 900 IP addresses, though I doubt all of them are sybil, just a majority.\n\nI can prove that as false with evidence right now.\n\nhttp://xtnodes.com/other_nodes_and_xt_nodes.php\n\nBy looking at the chart, you can see a decline in the average number of core nodes by about 400 while the total nodes grow by 900.

Community members, experts, wallet services, exchanges, merchants must also be taken into account. So far, broad consensus hasn't emerged, and that much is clear by the fact that we can barely discuss the issue without people losing their cool. If we had consensus on **when** and **how** to increase the block size, then we wouldn't even be having this discussion. The fact that it's still such a contentious discussion is proof that we're still a long way from consensus. \n\nConsensus doesn't have to be unanimous, and that's probably not achievable anyways. But it needs to be so substantial that we don't run the risk of splitting the network in two. I've said recently that if the hard fork were triggered at 90-95% hashrate for 10 weeks (9,000 blocks of the last 10,000), that would be a much clearer picture of where the miners stand and would ease my mind a lot.

": 24, ">I don't see the point of running a full node at all if you're going to trust your VPS. Might as well just trust a pool which is free/cheaper.\n\nIf you don't like the VPS idea, then you can do a colocation. Send a server off to a datacenter with an encrypted filesystem. Don't give the colo company the password or key. It's a bit more expensive that way, and will probably cost you about $50/month instead of $10/month. \n\n> Indeed, a large component of my post was that running a full node is an expense (1.25% of your revenue or a large chunk of your profit) and because it is optional, miners will often not full nodes unless they are trivial to run.\n\nIt's 1.25% of one of our expenses, not 1.25% of operating profit. It's not even 1.25% of total expenses, since we've got really cheap electricity ($0.025/kWh) and we spend the same order of magnitude on labor as we do on electricity. We only spend about 3x as much on internet as the average house, and most of that is just for redundancy. We could pare it down to about 0.6% of our electricity costs, but currently we overpay because we're willing to pay 100% more to gain 0.1% in uptime.\n\nWhen budgeting costs and doing forecasts, I don't even pay attention to how much we spend on bandwidth. It's a drop in the bucket.\n\nSince everyone will have to pay bandwidth costs, it won't make mining unprofitable. It might make the eventual hashrate equilibrium a little bit smaller, but probably only 1% or so smaller.\n\nHaving bandwidth be a significant cost would have the effect of making bitcoin mines optimize their design in part for high bandwidth. Putting a financial incentive behind handling large amounts of data is pretty much necessary for becoming a large payment processing network. Insofar that bandwidth costs will increase as a portion of total expenses, I think that will be good. However, bandwidth costs are going to remain very small for all but the tiniest of miners.\n\n": 1, "That's an interesting one. We're reaching the limits of my understanding of the implementation code.\n\nIt seems you could do that without issues, forcing the download of a full block. The first step is merkle tree checking, because that's cheaper than signature and logic checking, at which point the client would consider the block sent to be invalid, raising the banscore of the sender.\n\nIf you had multiple neighbor nodes under your control, I guess you could do this for a while, forcing the receivers to do some CPU work, but more importantly, forcing them to download every such mangled block. However, you're in a race with honest peers broadcasting the real block. Once the node downloads a block that works, it'll ignore any other offers of the same block.\n\nSo if you don't control the block's broadcasting (because it isn't yours), you won't be able to do a ton of damage (especially since miners have direct connections to each other, usually).\n\nIf you do, delaying the broadcast of the valid (non-scrambled) block means you're essentially delaying broadcasting your own solution, much like selfish-mining, which incurs a very real risk of orphaning. Moreover, the nodes you're tying up in validation are not actually receiving your real block anyway, so delaying them doesn't do any extra damage vs. just withholding your solution. You could try to broadcast the legit block to some part of the miners, and the mangled block to others, but again, that's going to only work until the legit block gets relayed  over (and that's a matter of seconds).\n\nI'll have to look at the code to make 100% sure my reasoning is correct.": 1, 'just watch\n': -2, "I'm a 0.25% miner. I run a 1 PH bitcoin mining hosting company in central Washington.\n\nWe spend about 1/80th as much on internet connectivity as we do on power. That gives us two 100 Mbps symmetrical fiber lines, of which one is just a backup. On that single fiber, we're running two full nodes, two p2pool nodes, about 1 PH/s of miners, and a few other things. With 400 kB average blocks, that uses about 1% of our available bandwidth. \n\nIf we scaled up to 8 MB average blocks (40x higher transaction volume than today), that would use about 20% of our bandwidth, while still only costing 1.25% as much as we pay in electricity. \n\nCurrently, transaction fees are about 0.1 BTC per block. If transaction volume were 40x higher, that would be about 4 BTC per block. This increase would more than compensate for the increased bandwidth and storage usage.\n\nEdit: 0.25% miner, not 0.4%.": 1, 'proven to be satistically impossible.

For purposes of section 103.53, a person structures a transaction if that person, acting alone, or in conjunction with, or on behalf of, other persons, conducts or attempts to conduct one or more transactions in currency, in any amount, at one or more financial institutions, on one or more days, in any manner, for the purpose of evading the reporting requirements under section 103.22 of this part. \xe2\x80\x9cIn any manner\xe2\x80\x9d includes, but is not limited to, the breaking down of a single sum of currency exceeding $10,000 into smaller sums, including sums at or below $10,000, or the conduct of a transaction, or series of currency transactions, including transactions at or below $10,000. The transaction or transactions need not exceed the $10,000 reporting threshold at any single financial institution on any single day in order to constitute structuring within the meaning of this definition.\n\n31 CFR 1010.100(m) - Currency. The coin and paper money of the United States or of any other country that is designated as legal tender and that circulates and is customarily used and accepted as a medium of exchange in the country of issuance. Currency includes U.S. silver certificates, U.S. notes and Federal Reserve notes. Currency also includes official foreign bank notes that are customarily used and accepted as a medium of exchange in a foreign country.\n\nSo, to reiterate, Bitcoin is NOT U.S. currency and is NOT legal tender, is not regulated and has nothing to do with structuring, as defined above.\n\nMay you get the winning lottery ticket and a hole in your pocket - GOOD DAY.': 1, 'How did you get to this image in privacytools.io?

It wont. \n\nBitcoin is in danger of becoming owned by the Bitcoin.org\'s Bitcoin Foundation, centralized miners, and government bodies who wish to license it. While I am not willing to disown progress, or even capitalism or centralization idealistically, I do believe that we as a community need to make bitcoin more than just a computer network - but a decentralized political network without the potential for centralized stake holders in both mining and/or leadership calling all the shots. If we do not, we will wake up one day, and find out that Bitcoin is centralized, and owned by Wall Street. While I\'m not against Bitcoin becoming centralized, I do fully recognize that this was never what Bitcoin was developed for by open source volunteers, violating the spirit of Bitcoin\'s protocol. \n\nMaybe there needs to be an open source way for Bitcoin to determine politically its adoptions and future, as opposed to forking off blindly in directions set by centralized stake holders. There aught to maybe be an open source way of programming that possibility. \n\n\n\n': 1, 'Bitcoins current political praxis relies almost exclusively on "smell...."; which is not very evolved.

You could do the same with leaders - while nurturing all kinds of various opinions and disagreements (that should be encouraged) that eventually get decided upon. You would need a website and maybe a blockchain coin to decide upon it all. \n\nthere are problems with this of course. there are unlimited wallets and addresses, and I don't know how a Bitcoin network could ask for a fair vote, without having to identify a limited amount of people. I suppose people might have to register with the Bitcoin Foundation to have a say. \n\ni suppose transaction fees would have to pay for a lot more than just miners, as well... but Bitcoin Foundation payroll and political infrastructure.\n\nFor myself, this approach is problematic. but the alternative is that we might merely give Bitcoin over to central banks and Wall Street entrepreneurs. For that matter, Wall Street et al, might do it for Bitcoin, simply because they might already be more dynamic politically than Bitcoin ever has been.
