In order to mitigate such risks in the short term and protect the regulated financial services sector, the EBA recommended that national supervisory authorities discourage credit, payment, and e-money institutions from buying, holding, or selling digital currencies.\n\n**Often this is quoted partially, but read carefully, they are *not* saying anything should be done here, they are quoting the EBA recommendations.**\n\n>Digital currencies represent an innovative payment method with many potential benefits. In particular, there are real opportunities for the banking industry and other industries in the underlying technology, such as the \xe2\x80\x98distributed ledger\xe2\x80\x99. However, it is important to strike an appropriate balance that supports innovation, while preventing illegal activity and offering protection to consumers.\n\n**Look how they say "balance" instead of "ermagerd, BAN IT". It\'s not that negative.**\n\n>When contemplating the aspects of the digital currency ecosystem that HM Treasury might intervene, we note that in Europe for example, Lord Hill suggests that digital exchanges and other digital currency service providers, rather than the underlying infrastructure providers, be brought into the scope of the Fourth EU Anti-Money Laundering Directive (AMLD4) as \xe2\x80\x9cobliged entities\xe2\x80\x9d and hence authorised to operate. Given that the exchanges are more likely to be physically located, or at least have connection with a particular nation state (for the purposes of cashing out) this seems to be a logical approach to take.\n\n**Fair enough.**\n\n>3.1\tPotential Benefits\nDigital currencies may offer a number of potential benefits to legitimate users including reduced transaction costs, faster transaction speeds, financial inclusion, competition and innovation. However, as noted in the June 2014 EBA Opinion, pending EU regulations and directives are explicitly addressing some of the issues that the benefits of digital currencies may be able to address. Similarly, in the UK domestic market, Faster Payments offers many of the same benefits as digital currencies. Both are real-time, irrevocable, credit push and low cost, and in most cases Faster Payments are free to consumers. Faster Payments also conform to all AML and related regulations and operate under a supervised consumer protection regime. In cross-border payment scenarios, though, where many current competitors are not conventional financial institutions, digital currencies may indeed provide lower costs and other benefits to some customers.\n\n**TLDR; Bitcoin might be to an advantage for Consumers.**\n\n>Ultimately, provided that the risks identified in section 4 of this submission are addressed appropriately, potential benefits for the wider UK economy might include:\n\n>* Positioning the UK as the centre for digital currency expertise and introducing an additional channel of tax revenue and investment.\n* Recorded transactions leaving a public audit trail, which could support financial crime control with effective international co-operation\n* Fewer barriers to cross border trade. \n* Faster settlement time for payments. \n* Lower transmission charges, and lower charges for cross-border e-Commerce and money remittance. \n* Enhanced ability to carry out \xe2\x80\x98micro-payments\xe2\x80\x99, for example paying a nominal amount to access a news article online.\n\n**Seems fair! Look how they seem to get "it" and are even giving Digital currencies credit where there\'s credit due.**\n\n>One of the most innovative aspects of digital currencies is the use of distributed ledger that supports decentralised payments. Currently, there are a range of centralised and de-centralised digital currencies operating on variations of this distributed ledger technology. The ledger technology offers potential opportunities to fundamentally change the way many value transactions both within and outside of the payments system are made, including the distribution and communication of assets, company shares, and securities. The ledger presents an opportunity for the industry to explore how this technology can be used to improve and enhance the existing fiat UK payment systems , or make use of the technology in a more structured way, similarly to that used in the commodity (such as gold and silver) markets. \n\n**ok.....go on?**\n\n>Given that the distributed ledger technology is open source and still in the early days of its development, it might be better for any \xe2\x80\x98intervention\xe2\x80\x99 on the core technology itself to be light touch, so as to support continuing innovation in a positive way.\n\n**So they might want to fork it? I find this a weird sentence**\n\n>Digital currency exchanges have also not been subject to registration or licence requirements, and consumer detriment has been suffered where digital currencies and digital currency exchanges have been used to fund illegal activities\n\n**Lies.**\n\n>As digital currencies are not backed by a government or central bank with appropriate fiscal controls, they can demonstrate high volatility with the potential for complete loss of value. This may affect investors as well as consumers using digital currencies as a means of payment. Digital currency volatility may make security offerings tied to these currencies unsuitable for most investors.\n\n**This is true, but is up to the "investor".**\n\n>Digital currencies have a number of features which could be exploited by criminals, terrorists and states seeking to launder illicit funds and evade sanctions. Any intervention in digital currencies in the UK should seek to mitigate these risks to allow consumers and businesses to use digital currencies for legitimate purposes.\n\n**This is not super negative, they don\'t want to ban it.**\n\n>There are also additional technologies that can be utilised to provide even greater levels of anonymity, notably The Onion Router and tumbling services\n\n**Lies. Tor is terrible for anonymity when using Bitcoin**\n\n>Payments Council has been engaging with The Bitcoin Foundation to explore their request to be assigned a global currency identifier to standardise its unit of measure. We therefore note that any regulatory initiative could also investigate the extent to which standardisation in this space could increase transparency and unambiguous identification of digital currencies as they are traded or indexed.\n\n**XBT is around the corner?**\n\n>A characteristic of many digital currencies is an uncontrolled currency issuing process. However, the impact that digital currencies can have on monetary or financial stability currently is limitedven the size of the digital currency market (global Bitcoin transactions are currently estimated at 60,000 per day, 300 of which occur in the UK). However, if \xe2\x80\x98convertible\xe2\x80\x995 digital currencies were to reach mass adoption in the UK, there is a possibility that this may have an increasing effect on sterling.

The exact same thing applies to bitcoin addresses.\n\nYou could fix it (rather, bandage it) by making the bloom filter more abstract; asking for less \'numbers\' that match, increasing the amount of false positives returned to you and making it exponentially harder for the providing party to infer connections.\n\nYou can also \'fix\' it by only querying nodes you trust or own.\n\n// Edit: Neither of these \'fixes\' are very satisfactory. So this probably needs some research going forward. The paper\'s abstract suggests they\'ve come up with a solution, which I\'m curious about.\n\n> Motivated by these findings, we propose an efficient countermeasure to enhance the privacy of users which rely on SPV clients; our proposal can be directly integrated within existing SPV client implementations.\n\n// Edit2: You could, of course, also fix it by making sure the addresses you\'re querying for have no past connections to eachother.

Without block rewards, miners would choose how many resources to put into hardware, electricity, and R&D based upon the expected transaction fees that they would reap from blocks.": 1, "Good question! So a couple points to make.\n\nFirstly Visa didn't do 30k TPS in 2012. That's their peak capacity. They average about 2.000. Meaning that by the numbers in your example in 10 years bitcoin could process more than 3x Visa's volume on average.\n\nAs for your hypothetical number: Is a 1gb block in 10 years realistic? I think it's a little optimistic personally. But we know two things. One is that bitcoin can already work quite fine with 20mb blocks and Gavin Andresen's been testing this. He said he can easily keep up with 20mb blocks, and can even do 200mb blocks already. (on his 2012 home PC).\n\nThe technological capacity grows at roughly 55% per year. Moore's law (CPU), Nielsen's law (bandwidth) and Kryder's law (storage) all follow roughly this trend. That's an 80x growth every 10 years, meaning that a 20mb block today (handled by a 2012 'easily' according to Gavin) could grow into a 1600mb block in 10 years. As bitcoin becomes bigger, we can also expect nodes to be run by more professional services which can easily handle blocks 10x bigger. Gavin's 2012 home PC can, today, handle 200mb blocks, 10x more than the 20mb block in the example above. If he had used a professional server as a node, he could easily do 500mb blocks today. So in 10 years it's feasible to say that a home PC can easily do 1gig blocks, but that a professional server node could handle way more.\n\nStill I like to err massively on the low end and say that 1gig blocks are optimistic. But in theory, it looks like it'd be easily possible.\n\nSecondly, bitcoin is a ledger for money, but that doesn't mean every transaction in history must be recorded on it. For example, if I give $25 to my GF to do some groceries I don't have to record that in a permanent ledger accessible to the entire world. What we could register on the blockchain is a month's worth of transactions between me and her.\n\nMy point is that bitcoin will likely not be used to register every single transaction, like buying a cup of coffee. Look at Changetip for example. /u/changetip 1 upvote. I just sent you money outside of the blockchain. Yet changetip uses the blockchain to settle accounts and get money in and out of their system.\n\nIn other words, we'll likely see an emergence of financial services that operate off-chain, but use bitcoin to settle accounts or large trades or groups of transactions. \n\nFor example, Google Driverless Cars might one day be configured with a 'speed mode' and charged with $10. (1 transaction). Then the car will communicate with other driverless cars on the highway, and it will pay say 10c for a car to get out of the way, essentially creating a paid fastlane dynamically. Cars whose owners configured it to 'time is not essential' now earn 10-20% of their fuel costs by letting cars with owners who are willing to pay more for their road pay them to get out of the way. All these small transactions will happen on the fly, but they don't need to necessarily each get recorded on the blockchain, maybe Google records each microtransaction to each car then uses the blockchain to settle it at the end of the trip.\n\nInstead they can use micropayment channels or sidechains or off-chain ledgers. Bitcoin becomes the settling system to tie everything together.\n\nTo make a long story short, bitcoin can power millions of non-bitcoin blockchain transactions per second.\n\nBeyond that there are indeed optimizations to the protocol to make it easier to process larger blocks without creating incentive problems for miners or making it slow to sync the blockchain or hard to store it. (invertible bloom filters, headers first, blockchain pruning etc). Squeezing more transactions into a fixed amount of data is limited though as you can only compress so much.

At 1% *eventual* transaction fees ... there\'s not much of a revenue business you can build out of that.  About $600 total:\n\n> According to ChangeTip\'s own disclosure, after a huge quarter of growth, their cold wallet holds 155BTC. That 155BTC amounts to less than $60K. Which in turn is approximately the cost of a few months\' salary for a junior developer in the valley. Keep in mind that this is only the money they hold on behalf of their users, so we have to look at their business model to derive their actual revenue. ChangeTip has not started charging their users yet, but they plan to finance themselves with a 1% fee on all transactions that take money out of their system. That means that the maximum revenue they can generate from their current holdings is $600. Note that I am still not using Verizon-math and I did not leave out a "K" or "M" at the end.  To help visualize that, $600 is roughly equal to the average Bush tax rebate per household, which most people squandered on a set of wireless speakers. And that\'s revenue, not profit. Assuming a multiplier of 20X, the total value of the company is a big fat $12K.

Until then, I'd urge anyone to transfer their bitcoin to the remittance service straight away, after all they lock in the price for you.\n\nAdditionally one can also opt to use services that lock in the price like Bitreserve or Coinapult Locks.
