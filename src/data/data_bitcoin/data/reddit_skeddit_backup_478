We realize a lot of people put a lot of money into it and we want to try to help the paycoin ecosystem to take some of the sting away. \n\nI also want to point out our Admins have never "Hyped" the coin in our trollbox. I defy anyone to send me a screenshot or proof of it. We do hold to those standards at Cryptsy. If a Mod on the other hand did it, if you send proof, they will be let go. I personally have faith in our mods and severely doubt they did that. \n\nAnyways, We were not "in" on a scam since the beginning, or at all. Any suspicious activity done by the Paycoin Team was reported as is required by law in our jurisdiction. Owning a node is a way to try to help the coin community instead of just shunning them. I hope this has helped clear things up a little for the reasonable ones, although I know some are just looking for a fight on something they don\'t fully understand.\n\nI will say that I do fully understand the skepticism -- Paycoins old team screwed a lot of people. Hopefully with the new ( less decentralized ) masternode system -- and a much cheaper coin -- things can actually start to work out.\n\nThank you, \n\nHorus': 4, 'Oh really?

Obviously this is nothing like Bitcoin, there will not be limited supply, there may not even be mining, just a way to peg fiat value to a blockchain. There are already projects doing this, but so far there is not one clear leader in the space.\n\nSo say we do get to the point where all our fiat is digitized and secured cryptographically on a blockchain. We would probably see a very slow transition until eventually no one is using cash or debit cards any more, just this digital cash. At this point we can easily exchange our crypto fiat for Bitcoin with no third party, just by facilitating the use of both blockchains.\n\nThe question is, if we do end up with this secure, instantaneous cryptographic fiat payment network, will there be a need for Bitcoin? I\'d wager yes, at this point ownership off all assets, and all sorts of contracts will be processed through blockchains. In the end, this digital cash will still have no limited supply, the same problems that is has today minus the outdated payment processing. Now people will start to think to themselves, "how can I protect my wealth against inflation"? \n\nThe answer to that question may be Bitcoin, and it will be as simple as a single click of a button to exchange their fiat to BTC, or probably any other number of digitalized assets.

Whatever the case, women are very much a minority in the business of bitcoin. But there are more of them than a Fusion piece this week would have you believe.\n\nThe story, entitled, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy bitcoin\xe2\x80\x99s male domination will be its downfall,\xe2\x80\x9d garnered fast and furious responses on Twitter from people in the bitcoin community who disputed author Felix Salmon\xe2\x80\x99s representation of the issue. (\xe2\x80\x9cEffectively zero,\xe2\x80\x9d he says at one point; an \xe2\x80\x9calmost complete absence\xe2\x80\x9d at another. ) Using Nathaniel Popper\xe2\x80\x99s forthcoming bitcoin book Digital Gold as a jumping-off point, Salmon wrote, \xe2\x80\x9cIf you are a woman involved with Bitcoin, you are invariably going to get treated like an outsider.\xe2\x80\x9d Digital Gold focuses on the origins of bitcoin and a small handful of its earliest characters. Popper told Salmon he put effort into \xe2\x80\x9ctrying to find a woman who was involved in some substantive way,\xe2\x80\x9d but as Salmon (not Popper) says, the result was \xe2\x80\x9cZero. Nothing. Zilch.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThat string of strong words is a bit misleading. It refers to the involvement of women in the very early days of bitcoin. Nowadays, the landscape is different. Popper, for his part, was mostly silent on the issue\xe2\x80\x94but replied to one critical tweet by saying, \xe2\x80\x9cI would wait and read the book before you conclude what I say in it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nOn Twitter, bitcoin folks were quick to reply to Salmon.\n\nThe bitcoin industry has what Brian Forde, director of digital currency for MIT Media Lab, calls a \xe2\x80\x9cpale male\xe2\x80\x9d problem. (At a roundtable discussion about BitLicense this week, all of the bitcoin executives and policy pundits were male\xe2\x80\x94the only female in the room was a reporter covering the talk.) An ongoing Coindesk survey first posted in March asks, \xe2\x80\x9cIs the Bitcoin community just young, white and male?\xe2\x80\x9d A separate survey from 2013 concluded that 96% of bitcoin \xe2\x80\x9cusers\xe2\x80\x9d are male.\n\nBut there are quite a few women in the business of bitcoin\xe2\x80\x94and while they may be heavily outnumbered by their male counterparts, they are hardly standing on the sidelines. \xe2\x80\x9cI might be a special case, but in my experience, I\xe2\x80\x99ve only been welcomed and encouraged in this space,\xe2\x80\x9d says Andrea Castillo, an economic researcher at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve never felt there were barriers presented to me because of my gender. If anything, I think people have been nicer to me because of it.\xe2\x80\x9d Castillo and her former colleague Jerry Brito worked together on bitcoin\xe2\x80\x99s first policy primer\xe2\x80\x94Brito now serves as executive director for Coin Center, a nonprofit watchdog working to help influence policy and regulation of the industry.\n\nOn Twitter, Brito responded to Salmon\xe2\x80\x99s article by pointing out that Castillo herself is one of the most influential women in bitcoin policy, along with his Coin Center colleague Robin Weisman.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can always look at a ratio on paper,\xe2\x80\x9d says Castillo, \xe2\x80\x9cbut for me the more interesting question is, Are there any barriers? Are there people who don\xe2\x80\x99t want them [women or people of color] to join and be involved? I don\xe2\x80\x99t see that at all. I see everyone saying, \xe2\x80\x98Are you interested in bitcoin? Join us, get involved.\xe2\x80\x9d I mean, it\xe2\x80\x99s an open-source project.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nM.K. Lords is another vocal woman in the industry, and one of many people who are actively involved in the bitcoin community without working full-time at a bitcoin company. Lord\xe2\x80\x99s day job is at a brokerage that accepts bitcoin for non-precious metals. In her free time she runs a bitcoin blog, hosts a bitcoin radio program, and has assembled multiple bitcoin conferences. \xe2\x80\x9cTo say there are no women in bitcoin is sexist because it diminishes all the very active women in the space,\xe2\x80\x9d she says. \xe2\x80\x9cWomen are accepted with open arms in the bitcoin industry. Yes, you deal with similar culture in tech at large, it is mostly male, but I haven\xe2\x80\x99t experienced any kind of sexism. At my conferences, I had 40% more women in full speaker slots than other conferences.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThere are in fact so many women working in the industry, Lords says, that, \xe2\x80\x9cif you ask three different women who the prominent women in bitcoin are, you\xe2\x80\x99ll get different names each time. There really are a lot of us.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIn that spirit, here are just 10 of the prominent female voices in bitcoin. It\xe2\x80\x99s by no means an exhaustive list (nor a ranking), but it helps to push back on the assertion that women have been sidelined in the growing business of digital currency.\n\n\xe2\x80\x93 Elizabeth Rossiello, CEO, BitPesa\n\nRossiello\xe2\x80\x99s company focuses on Africa, allowing for quick and inexpensive money transfers to the continent.\n\n\xe2\x80\x93 Cindy McAdam, president and general counsel at Xapo\n\nWith $40 million in funding, Xapo is one of the most prominent bitcoin wallet services.

She was a 2013 TED speaker in New York and now runs Code to Inspire, which teaches young women in Afhganistan to code.\n\n\xe2\x80\x93 Catheryne Nicholson, CEO, BlockCypher\n\nA former U.S, Naval officer, Nicholson is co-founder and CEO of BlockCypher, one of a handful of platforms for building applications on bitcoin\xe2\x80\x99s block chain.\n\n\xe2\x80\x93 Elizabeth Stark, entrepreneur-in-residence, StartX\n\nA former professor of tech policy at Stanford and Yale, Stark was key in the movement against SOPA. She is entrepreneur in residence at the non-profit accelerator StartX, and is part of Start Bitcoin, a group of entrepreneurs advocating for digital currency technologies.\n\n\xe2\x80\x93 Blythe Masters, CEO, Digital Asset Holdings\n\nPerhaps one of the biggest names to have jumped into digital currency, Masters left her post as head of global commodities at JPMorgan last year. In March, she was named chief executive at this recently launched trading platform.\n\nThe perception that there is a dearth of women in bitcoin harms efforts to change it. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s so easy to paint bitcoin with a broad brush, but there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of details people leave out,\xe2\x80\x9d Lords says. \xe2\x80\x9cIn fact, when there are articles about a problem with women, I hear mostly from the men, saying, \xe2\x80\x98This is crazy! We love the women in bitcoin and we want more of them.\'\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPua Pyland, who runs the blog \xe2\x80\x9cThe Bitcoin Wife\xe2\x80\x9d and was one of the only female voices in bitcoin early on, told Fortune back in February that when she first started her blog, \xe2\x80\x9cit was a very different landscape. The community was small, and there were no forward-facing female advocates. My husband and I were early adopters, and I was looking to provide a different voice and perspective on Bitcoin\xe2\x80\xa6. Fast-forward to today.

The recipients of those loans withdraw the $0.90 as cash and the bank still meets it's reserve requirement of 10%.\n> Scenario B: However, if the bank thinks that some of the loan recipients will not withdraw the funds and deplete its cash reserves, the bank can lend (create) more money. In fact, the bank could lend (create) up to $9.00 in new money and still meet its reserve requirement of 10%. This would mean that none of the money created as part of the loans was withdrawn from the bank, which of course is unlikely. However, it is also likely that at least some portion of the loan recipients new dollars will not be withdrawn as reserves.
