Care to post the content here?': 1, '\nThere has been no shortage of coverage of Bitcoin and the technology surrounding it over the past year. It seems at every conference a panelist talks about the impact digital currency will have on the industry.\nSo it\'s only fitting that at the Fintech Startups Conference in New York someone decided to give their two cents on a trend that seems to continue to pick up steam in the industry.\nDavid Jegen, managing director of Devonshire Investments, which is the private investment arm of $1.98 trillion Fidelity Investments, was that person, joking that it wouldn\'t be a fintech conference without mentioning blockchain, the technology behind digital currency.\n"Blockchain is a great long-term opportunity for Wall Street," Jegen said. "I think especially on the clearing and settling side."\nJegen said the three things needed during settlement \xe2\x94\x80 both parties making value simultaneously, trust and something to record it all on a permanent ledger that can\'t be reputed \xe2\x94\x80 are all offered by blockchain.\nCompanies that are familiar with blockchain technology and would eventually be able to translate it to the settlement process are of particular interest for Jegen.\n"We very much like companies that are trying to take that and apply it to the digital currency world today, which seems less consequential and threatening to Wall Street, but build the settlement process that could later be extended into core products like credit defaults, swaps or interest rate swaps."\nIt\'s a big opportunity, Jegen said, not only for the amount of settling that needs to be done every day in the industry, but the money it costs.\n"Nobody really likes it," said Jegen of the settlement process. "In fact, the only reason Wall Street likes it is because they own a lot of the institutions that do it, like Omgeo, Swift or DTCC."\n': 1}, ('"I do still think that Bitcoin has a substantial chance of becoming a pure asset class for investment, and I still hold a lot of it for that reason, but that\xe2\x80\x99s a rather boring future and not one whose social value I find all that exciting. -Vitalik Buterin on why bitcoin is boring', 19): {'To me, the most exciting part of ethereum is the idea that you can run verifiable programs.

Don\'t tell me about not functioning. ;-p\n\nOkay, basic introduction. Gotcha. Yeah, that is clearer. I figured that was probably the approach, but didn\'t want to jump in with that until I was sure.\n\nWell, I\'d say the "Getting Started" link over on the sidebar makes sense to start. :-) https://bitcoin.org/en/getting-started Those steps aren\'t necessarily all applicable but it gives you an idea.\n\nSo there are sort of two major approaches here. There\'s the approach of learning about all of the fundamentals, which is great, but takes a while, and eventually goes into a lot of advanced math and programming. The other approach is sort of just to jump in and try it out.\n\nIf you want to go through the fundamentals, the whitepaper is a great place to start: https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf ; I\'ve actually never made it all the way through, but don\'t let that stop you. As much as you can read will help. Just try to absorb what you can, and then give it some time, and try it again, and repeat.\n\nOn the side of just trying it out, you can make an online wallet at https://block.io/. Now, this isn\'t the high-security approach that the dedicated bitcoin user would do (having everything local and managing security themselves, etc.), but it gets you on the network as it were. Another approach are the Reddit tipbots. I actually haven\'t used the bitcoin tipbot for a while now, so I can\'t swear to the syntax and such, but this is a clonecoin which is based on the same technology:\n\n+/u/tipnyan 1000 nyan\n\nWhat that does is send you a message that you can create an account with it (reply with +accept to have the account created). It is another form of online wallet, and it can then be sent to any other address. Of course, note that that is nyancoin, rather than bitcoin, so the addresses would be nyancoin addresses in that case, which is a very obscure thing in comparison.\n\nYou can also get a wide variety of wallets from https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet.\n\nYou can send it to anyone who has an address. Addresses are free. Transactions generally have a transaction fee of 0.001 BTC iirc (the rules can be rather complex and the standard fee sometimes goes down by a factor of 10).\n\nIn order to really use it though, you\'re going to want to get some. And that requires either buying it (there are a lot of exchanges and such; on the other hand, it can be rather expensive at this point) or being given it (possible in smallish amounts) or earning it (selling goods or services).\n\nSpending is just sending with a particular address being setup expecting a certain amount. That is, if you were checking out at a site and you owed 0.01 BTC, then it will give you an address, you send the 0.01 BTC to that address, and they\'ll know it was you because they generate an address for each transaction (there are practically an infinite number of addresses, so best practices actually include using each address only once).\n\nThere\'s a lot of complexity, but I hope that helps with the basics. I would definitely recommend reading through the sidebar and links. There are certainly gaps there, but it should give you a really solid intro.': 1, 'Pros: Disruptive technology, Very low fees, fast transfers, no minimums/limits, irreversible, pseudo-anonymous, mathematically secure, accessible to people worldwide (not subject to signup screenings, credit checks, etc.), limited/scarce, deflationary\n\nCons: irreversible, volatile, legal/regulatory uncertainty, few merchants accept it currently, bad reputation (association with silk road, etc.), deflationary\n\nSome of the pros and cons overlap.': 1, "This is way, way too broad.

That's my opinion, but I'm as convinced about that as I am anything in the world. This is natively online money. It transacts quickly and cheaply, and the payment network and currency are built together. It has a(n ultimately) fixed supply, which in my opinion is gold (that's a pun but also true).\n\nCon: It's still just starting. Gold has a history the length of recorded human history. Bitcoin has a few years. There are a number of rough edges and it's still considered beta software technically.\n\nMy personal experience: I was familiar with bitcoin both from the Silk Road and from being interested in the technology back when it was around $5-$10.

Then later it picks up steam again retracing those gains 100% but on weaker volume. It retraces downward again failing to break that level. When you see it rising again on low volume, you decide to enter a short position at around the level of the previous two tops, you place stoploss at a little bit above that level (there\'s some judgement involved in learning how to set stoploss well), and you set your exit at some level of downward retracement for example based on fib levels (there is a lot to this subject too, this is why people have to study this and gain experience in practice).\n\nThat\'s not making a prediction per se in the bizarre way that you\'re characterizing as how to validate these ideas. That\'s learning how to react to what\'s happening on the chart by placing yourself in a position that attempts to minimize risk and maximize potential profit by responding to what\'s actually happening in the chart. Yes, it\'s possible in that triple top trading example that the market can break the level (because this isn\'t some magical law of nature system like you\'re expecting), in fact not too long ago in Bitcoin at ~$315 level there was a triple-top fakeout that broke the top before retracing downward.

You\'ve just hit a deep hard cross-court shot. The standard workflow for a groundstroke rally is that you need to splitstep and watch to react to the return by the time the ball makes contact with your opponent\'s racket. Conventional instruction says that you should position a few feet to the side of the centerline opposite the direction of your shot. \n\nThe reason you do this is not because you\'re predicting anything about the shot that\'s going to be returned. It\'s that we know empirically as a general heuristic that a deep down-the-line shot is very low percentage, for a number of compounding reasons (i.e. the opponent is on the run, trying to hit an extremely technical shot with a lot of spin over the highest part of the net while still pinning you deep without going out). So the most likely thing your opponent is going to do is mirror your crosscourt shot back as a hard deep bomb (which you\'ve prepared for by standing a touch closer to where the ball is going to be), or if your opponent goes down the line, they might commit an unforced error and you win the point anyway, or their shot will likely be weak and/or shallow if it stays in, in which case you didn\'t really lose anything standing a little bit away from the area where that shot would land.\n\nNow just because this bit of instruction does not tell you with law-of-nature level rigor and precision exactly where the ball is going to be, doesn\'t mean that people just up and declare competitive tennis instruction "bullshit".

Scroll down the home page (https://bitpay.com/) and you'll find this:\n\n>INDUSTRY-LEADING LEGAL & REGULATORY COMPLIANCE\n\nThose highfalutin words are code for government-mandated collection of private information. Bitcoin's privacy model depends on a strict separation between user identity and public keys. Using BitPay gives a single organization the power to link the identities of a large fraction of all users to at least some of their public keys.\n\nCoinbase takes this one step further by harvesting information from users entering (buying bitcoin) and exiting (merchant checkout) the Bitcoin economy. A company capable of doing this at scale can read the block chain in a way that would likely shock and possibly anger many users.\n\nDecentralized, user-friendly solutions are feasible, but will take time to develop. The continued evolution of decentralized options will put pressure on the profit margins of those companies that decide to compete through centralized services.\n\nXapo (https://xapo.com/about/) is mentioned in the article. Its vault service is a response to the technical difficulty of secure bitcoin storage. But if better solutions to this technical problem emerge, the need for bank-like storage (and the fees that go with it) will fade.\n\nWallets seem like a central access point ripe for establishing a beachhead. Indeed, many Bitcoin companies offer wallets. However, wallet security failures have highlighted the importance of source code availability, open review, and community involvement. There are ways to make money from open source software, but that usually means selling a complementary product or service. The money-making complement to an open source wallet is far from clear.\n\nBitcoin companies that become very profitable may look very little like the companies that investors are used to taking a stake in. Bitcoin may even be fundamentally incompatible with traditional value-added financial products and services. And that means a lot of smart people will lose money.": 34, 'I lay with your mom last night': 9, 'The point is that with Bitcoin, you have a choice.

It'd be like telling Henry Ford in 1900, people will only want his fancy cars until someone invents teleportation (I understand that example is a little extreme, but you get my point). We will continue to supply the most secure means of storing bitcoin, and would naturally adapt in the event that our type of service became obsolete.

Now Prasos is making its way into the international scene with Denarium Bitcoin, the next generation of physical bitcoins.\n\nHelsinki 10.4.2015\n\nMike Caldwell created the first Physical Bitcoin in 2011 under the name Casascius and this taught us that people have a clear need to identify bitcoins with something physical. Bitcoin as a concept is hard to understand if it is envisioned as something purely virtual. A Physical Bitcoin is a great conversation starter - the perfect gateway to explaining Bitcoin. There has been only one problem - cheap & affordable coins have all but disappeared from the market.\n\n\xe2\x80\x93 Ever since US manufacturers ran into regulation issues, low price Physical Bitcoins have been a thing of the past. Years ago I used to give them out to friends & family but nowadays it\xe2\x80\x99s simply not possible because the coins are too expensive. We decided that we have the expertise and the right kind of regulatory environment to bring them back and eventually we came up with Denarium Bitcoin, says Prasos CEO Henry Brade.\n\nThe coins from Denarium are designed to have easily redeemable private keys. In addition to storing the private key in plain text, it is also stored in QR code format. This way the bitcoins inside a Denarium Bitcoin are easy to redeem and spend online. Denarium products are shipped worldwide and they come in two valuations, 1/10 of a bitcoin and 1/100 of a bitcoin. Both loaded and empty coins are available.\n\n\xe2\x80\x93 Asia has a number of emerging bitcoin markets with huge volumes of potential adopters. Just as in the West previously, a tangible bitcoin is a great first step into bitcoins for millions of new users, and makes the whole concept easier to understand, states Ville Oehman, who is bringing Denarium Bitcoin to Asian markets.\n\nThe pre-order of Denarium Bitcoin starts on Monday 13th of April at 12:00 UTC (London). This is 8 AM in New York and 8 PM in Singapore. All pre-order sales are done through the main website of Denarium, https://denarium.eu/.

The criticism may lead to additional parliamentary oversight of the Riksbank.\n> \n> So we recommend you read an important new speech from deputy governor Per Jansson that dispels many of the myths surrounding Swedish monetary policy. He makes two basic arguments:\n> \n> Decisions were driven by mainstream forecasts of inflation and growth, not house prices\n> Sweden has actually outperformed almost every other rich country since the crisis, including the US\n> The Riksbank\xe2\x80\x99s biggest critic has probably been Lars Svensson, who has argued that the central bank has failed to hit the inflation target because it raised rates for dubious reasons and was slow to cut them. (He also wrote a rebuttal to Jansson\xe2\x80\x99s speech.)\n> \n> But as Jansson notes, even if Svensson thought the Riksbank had been in error, the actual debate in mid-2011 \xe2\x80\x94 just before the last hike \xe2\x80\x94 was about the timing of further increases. Jansson points us to the meeting of 4 July 2011, when the decision was made to raise rates for what ended up being the last time. He notes that \xe2\x80\x9cthe differences concerned at what pace the repo rate should be raised and not that any member advocated that the repo rate should never have been raised after the crisis.\xe2\x80\x9d\n> \n> Whoever wrote the minutes drily observed that \xe2\x80\x9cin principle, [Svensson and his fellow dissenter Karolina Ekholm] both accept a larger increase today than was indicated by the repo-rate path they voted on in April.\xe2\x80\x9d At the next meeting, on September 6, Svensson and Ekholm both voted with the majority to leave policy unchanged, rather than cut rates. In his rebuttal to Jansson\xe2\x80\x99s speech, Svensson says that he dissented against every rate hike and therefore that the repo rate would have stayed at 0.25 per cent throughout the entire 2010-2011 period, for what that\xe2\x80\x99s worth.\n> \n> According to the minutes, Svensson fundamentally disagreed with his colleagues\xe2\x80\x99 estimate of potential GDP (a notoriously woolly concept) and how it related to the size of the output gap. In the US, this is paralleled by the endless debates about \xe2\x80\x9clabour market slack.\xe2\x80\x9d He also thought that the staff estimates of forward interest rates in the euro area, the UK, and the US were too high, and that this would lead to a damaging appreciation of the krona.\n> \n> Tellingly, Svensson didn\xe2\x80\x99t argue that the central bank was mistakenly obsessed with Swedish house prices. In fact, he didn\xe2\x80\x99t mention the subject at all, which makes us wonder how important it was to the decisions taken by the majority. This is really important since much of the retrospective criticism of the Riksbank attributes the rate hikes to an unreasonable desire to dampen house price growth and restrain household indebtedness. The evidence suggests that the central bank had more traditional concerns, for better or worse.\n> \n> We are also struck by what Svensson thought (at the time) would happen if the majority got its way. Just like everyone else at the Riksbank, he failed to anticipate the stubbornness of unemployment and the tendency towards disinflation. Svensson forecast that a steady path of rate hikes up from 2 per cent would, by the middle of 2014, push down Swedish unemployment to about 6 per cent. He also forecast that the consumer price inflation rate would, after a brief dip, end up around 1.5 per cent. Here is the chart Svensson presented to his colleagues during the meeting, with Svensson\xe2\x80\x99s preferred policy in blue:\n> \n> \n> \n> This was wrong. Despite cutting rates, Sweden has had essentially no improvement in the unemployment rate and has endured significant disinflation. One wonders what would have occurred had the Riksbank stuck to the policy path Svensson preferred at the time.\n> \n> In February of this year, Svensson posted his own calculations of what would have happened had the short rate held steady at 0.25 since the beginning of 2010. According to him, the path of the unemployment rate would have followed almost exactly the same path as that outlined by the red line in the chart above:\n> \n> \n> \n> (We suspect that most of these forecast errors can be blamed on the depression in the euro area.)\n> \n> To be fair, Svensson has previously argued that monetary policymakers should be judged on what was known to them at the time, rather than the actual outcomes of their policies. That exonerates him but should also absolve the majority of the Riksbank of most of its alleged sins. We therefore have some sympathy with Jansson\xe2\x80\x99s point that the critics are being unserious about what an alternative policy would have been:\n> \n> One might think it is strange that the claim that the Riksbank\xe2\x80\x99s repo-rate increases were only about leaning against the wind, and moreover that the increases were made contrary to prevailing opinion, has become so widely spread. After all, one does not need to make a more in-depth check of the facts than I have provided here to see that neither claim is correct.\n> \n> It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t require very much digging to be able to conclude that not only the Riksbank but also external domestic and international economic analysts found it natural, even after the repo rate had been raised to 2 per cent, that the increases would continue \xe2\x80\x93 and this without any particular reference to household debt.\n> \n> According to, for instance, Dagens Nyheter newspaper\xe2\x80\x99s editorial pages, the policy was instead \xe2\x80\x9can interest-rate increasing experiment\xe2\x80\x9d, based on the Riksbank governors spreading \xe2\x80\x9cmisleading pictures of the future\xe2\x80\x9d. The only explanation I can think of for this claim nevertheless being repeated and referred to so often and so uncritically, is that people simply assume that it must be true because it has been expressed with such emphasis and intensity.\n> \n> We would also note that we can find only one article about Swedish monetary policy coming from professor Krugman at any point between the beginning of 2010 and the end of 2011 \xe2\x80\x94 and it was a brief note in the fall of 2010.\n> \n> The other myth about Sweden, which Jansson dismisses quite convincingly, is that Sweden has had weak economic performance since because of monetary policy decisions since 2010.\n> \n> Sweden\xe2\x80\x99s real economic outcomes have actually been quite good. Yes, Sweden\xe2\x80\x99s unemployment rate looks stubbornly high compared to the US. But the share of the working age population with a job has done much better, because many Americans have dropped out of the labour force. Similarly, real GDP per person in Sweden has done better than most other rich countries relative to the pre-crisis peak:\n> \n> \n> \n> As can be seen, Sweden is not right at the top, but nor is it very far from it. There are only a few countries, according to these statistics only New Zealand and Germany, that have had a better development in both GDP and employment, that is, that are above and to the right of Sweden in the figure.\n> \n> Some claim that the development of unemployment has been less favourable. But here we must bear in mind the fact that the labour force in Sweden has increased relatively substantially during the period. This is essentially positive, but in the short run it will also contribute, purely mathematically, to keeping up the unemployment figures.\n> \n> The differences in this respect in relation to the United States, for instance, are fairly striking. The United States has had a more favourable development in unemployment, but quite a lot of this can be explained by the fact that labour force participation in the States has actually declined.\n> \n> Moreover, it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to argue that the recent spate of deflation is due to a catastrophic decline in demand:\n> \n> Of course, the relatively good development is not solely due to the monetary policy conducted by the Riksbank. Economic policy in general plays a large role, as does the fact that Sweden was not hit so hard by the crisis, for reasons not necessarily related to the policy conducted. It is also possible to have different views regarding exactly how good one thinks developments have been. But at a very minimum, it should be clear that it is difficult to find support in actual figures for an overly tight, \xe2\x80\x9caggressive\xe2\x80\x9d monetary policy having sent the economy into a state of deflation, driven by poor development in the real economy.\n> \n> If one looks ahead, then? Could it not be the case that the Swedish economy has managed fairly well so far, but that things will go badly in the future, as a result of the policy conducted? Of course, one cannot make any guarantees with regard to the future, but one can in any case note that the National Institute of Economic Research, the Ministry of Finance and the Riksbank are all currently forecasting growth of around 2 per cent this year and around 3 per cent in 2015\xe2\x80\x932016.

Department stores boast that the Christmas season was the best since the start of the crisis, while car sales rose more than 18 per cent last year. Analysts highlight that Spain\xe2\x80\x99s economic recovery \xe2\x80\x94 once entirely dependent on booming exports \xe2\x80\x94 is now driven ever more by rising domestic demand.\n\n> The Spanish spending spree has come despite an accelerating fall in prices. Inflation turned negative in August last year, and the decline has gathered pace ever since. In December, prices fell 1 per cent compared with the previous year, the sharpest drop in half a decade. Funcas, the economic think-tank of Spain\xe2\x80\x99s savings banks, expects 2015 to bring an across-the-board fall in prices of more than 1 per cent \xe2\x80\x94 and possibly more if the oil price continues to decline.\n\n> Against that backdrop, the defiance of Spanish consumers has offered relief to both the retail industry and the country\xe2\x80\x99s finance ministry. But it also poses something of a conundrum to many in the economics profession, which habitually warns that a fall in prices is dangerous because it leads to a drop in demand.\n\n> The theory is compelling: if consumers expect products to become cheaper over time, it makes sense for them to delay spending and wait for prices to fall further. Once this dynamic gains hold, it is likely to produce a vicious economic circle, and ultimately a sustained depression.\n\n> Concern over deflationary pressures in the eurozone is at the heart of the recent shift in policy at the European Central Bank. The ECB is on Thursday expected to unveil plans to buy government bonds on the secondary market \xe2\x80\x94 also known as quantitative easing \xe2\x80\x94 in an attempt to bring eurozone inflation closer to its target of just below 2 per cent.\n\n> What is happening in Spain however may complicate the debate by leading some to argue that falling prices can in fact coexist with rising demand \xe2\x80\x94 even for an extended period of time.\n\n> \xe2\x80\x9cWe think there is good deflation and bad deflation,\xe2\x80\x9d says Jos\xc3\xa9 Manuel Amor, an economist at Analistas Financieros Internacionales, a Madrid-based consultancy. \xe2\x80\x9cIn countries such as Italy you have bad deflation because there is no domestic demand and no consumption. In Spain, however, there is rising demand.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n> A similar dynamic \xe2\x80\x94 falling prices but rising consumption \xe2\x80\x94 can also be detected in Ireland and Portugal, adds Mr Amor, while France leans closer to the pernicious Italian example.\n\n> \xe2\x80\x9cOf course there is a risk going forward, and it is something policy makers have to take into account,\xe2\x80\x9d says Miguel Cardoso, chief economist for Spain at BBVA, the Spanish financial group. \xe2\x80\x9cBut what we are seeing in Spain is that the fall in prices is not having an impact on consumer decisions. People see it as a positive.\xe2\x80\x9d\n> \n> Javier Andr\xc3\xa9s, a professor of economy at University of Valencia, adds: \xe2\x80\x9cThe fall in prices is not strong enough, nor is it perceived to last that long, as to make it worthwhile for consumers to postpone the purchase of goods.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n> What is more, any psychological impact from the projected fall in prices appears to be \xe2\x80\x94 at least for the moment \xe2\x80\x94 cancelled out by a range of factors that work in the opposite direction.\n> \n> \xe2\x80\x9cWe have been in a deleveraging process for the past five or six years. The savings rate was very high, and now that confidence is back and the economic outlook has improved, people see they can actually raise their expenditure,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr Cardoso.\n\n> The broader economic recovery clearly helps: over the past year, Spain has created more than 400,000 new jobs, household income is on the rise and economic confidence has surged above the eurozone average for the first time in seven years. Spain\xe2\x80\x99s government, mindful that 2015 is an election year, has lowered taxes as of January. A final factor is the recent drop in oil prices, which has given a further lift to disposable income.\n\n> \xe2\x80\x9cIn Spain, the conditions for growth are there,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr Amor. \xe2\x80\x9cConsumers are behaving rationally.\xe2\x80\x9d': 1, "Being a low level of inflation isn't what deflation is you know.": -4, "It'd behoove you to learn the difference between Benign and Malign deflation;\n\nhttp://tutor2u.net/economics/revision-notes/a2-macro-deflation.html": 1, "auroracoin was nice idea but done by real amateurs, that's why it didn't get a traction at all.": 1, "Bitcoin is disinflationary. \n\nIt inflates, but that rate of inflation is scheduled to go down over time.\n\nOtherwise it would all be a big premine and there'd be difficulties distributing it.\n\nWould be interesting if an airdrop like Auroracoin over Iceland had worked better - there the model was if you were an Icelandic citizen you got some Auroracoins but it didn't seem to do well.\n\nAnyway, distributing coins is a whole 'nother story.

Investment firms show growing interest in the currency and in the technology behind it, which could point to more widespread use.\n\nThis year, the value of bitcoin has fallen about 23%, through Thursday, according to a CoinDesk index.

What we typically call off-blockchain transactions are equivalent to the internal adjustments to accounts within a single bank, i.e. crediting one account and debiting another. Examples of this are ChangeTip tips and Coinbase-to-Coinbase transactions.\n\n2. What we typically call on-blockchain transactions are equivalent to RTGS, where the blockchain takes the role of the central bank, any bitcoin address (and its key pair) is equivalent to an account with the central bank and transactions are final because the transfers of bitcoins (the unit of account for this particular central bank) are irreversible.\n\n On-blockchain transactions are better than RTGS, though, because they cost less than the \xc2\xa325 of CHAPS (and the probably similar costs for using FedWire and Target2)?\n\n3. Micropayment channels are somewhat equivalent to correspondent banking agreements, where you have bilateral (two-party) agreements, one or both parties agrees to tie up a certain amount with the other party and transactions can be instantly confirmed/accepted by adjusting the balances of the parties within the channel, while actual settlement is deferred.\n\n Micropayment channels are better than correspondent banking, though, because the credited party can, at **any** point in time, choose to end/settle the channel by transmitting the latest agreed-upon transaction to the network for inclusion in the blockchain. There\'s also no counterparty risk and the cost is negligible (apart from the opportunity cost of the tied up value).\n\n4. Hub-and-spoke networks, with a mesh of channels, are equivalent to correspondent banking routes with two or more "hops", and with the same improvements upon traditional banking systems as outlined in point 3, above. or Standardized networks with known "superhubs" could evolve into something DNS-like (DNS = deferred net settlement) for the cryptocurrency world, e.g. a \'switch\'-based scheme, like VISA/MasterCard?

[Subspace](https://medium.com/@chrispacia/subspace-73059a1cff71) is one example.\n\nLooking at it from this perspective, it\'s quite easy to see how bright bankers are saying this could disrupt the "payment rails" of inter-bank settlements.

You find yourself summing up problems and trying to consider all possible contingencies, playing adversary to your own ideas and those of others to crystalize flawless solutions that cover all possible cases.  \n  \nIt definitely reminded me of some of my best professors challenging us with random problems made up on the spot and breaking us into teams to solve.  I had one professor who claimed at the beginning of the semester that 'computer science can be about ANYTHING', and to prove it, he would let the class choose what the final project would be. \n  \nThe day we decided he asked us all for ideas.  I suggested a time-travel simulator.  Another popular idea was a Wookie-based space game where you would immerse yourself in Wookie society and gallivant about the universe.  Someone else suggested we remake an Oregon Trail type of game.   \n  \nOur final project?  'Time-Travelling Wookie Space Ships on the Oregon Trail'.  We were given a bunch of parameters - eras of time, locations, types of spacetime ships, ranks of Wookies, several time-travel drives (flux capacitor and Eye of Harmony were in there) with varying levels of failure rates, and events that could occur when you landed in a given era.  \n  \nIn the end you could use a Delorian to try to send a Wookie to say World War II Germany and try to kill Hitler and accidentally end up on the early american frontier with a dysentery-riddled Wookie crew.  \n  \nGreat class, great professor, and really opened my mind up to the possibilities made available by rigorous and thorough systems thinking.  \n  \nMiddle-out for the win.": 16, 'TJ Miller is so awesome, looking forward to this.

I'm not interested in a world where the weakest are allowed to starve and die and we do nothing to try and help other sentient human beings.  We don't all start with the same opportunities and advantages.  Things aren't equal.  Government is not a perfect mechanism, but it is far superior to what private institutions would offer.  Also worth noting that private institutions couldn't thrive and prosper without the security and societal stability that government provides.  The barbarians would be at their doors in no time.  \n  \nI'd argue that taxes are voluntary.  One is welcome to renounce their citizenship and try to make due in the world without the obligations required of citizens, but they must give up the protections and privileges afforded by the same.  \n  \nAs for how to implement basic income, I think Marshall Brain offered the [best thinking](http://marshallbrain.com/robotic-freedom.htm) I've come across on the matter.

Just because people want to do something doesn't really matter.  We have to share this world and that means compromise and mutually beneficial societal agreements.  If the private sector was doing an efficient job of distributing the planet's wealth in a fair and just way, then it wouldn't be necessary.  But they aren't.  Income inequality is at an obscene level.  One's right to profit is only reasonable if it is a net gain for society.  Profit is not the end goal nor the highest ideal.  A world free from suffering and injustice is the goal.  To the extent that capitalist systems work towards that goal, they are preferable.  If instead they create a world filled with greed, stagnant wages, massive swaths of poverty and suffering, starvation, violence and oppression, then their 'rights', possible only because the mob chooses not to burn it all to the ground, must be checked and altered.  \n  \nLower cost goods are useless if wages do not provide enough to acquire them anyway.  There is no reason for society to tolerate the current, worsening distribution of resources.  Keeping billions in poverty so that dozens can live lives of unimaginable lavishness is immoral and disgusting.  We've done just fine with the wealthiest being taxed as much as 90%.  During the 1950s and early 1960s, the top bracket income tax rate was over 90% and the economy, middle-class, and stock market boomed.  \n  \nThere is nothing that billionaires contribute that is of sufficient value to society to justify the current state of affairs.

I can imagine many developers being happy with just receiving a monthly pay check and concentrate on the code instead of worrying about marketing and / or padding their code contributions and where the money comes form.\n\n* I think we still need some kind of entity for the distribution of the funds, taking those burdens off of the developers shoulders, until we find a decentralized way that really works.\n\n* The developers can still work independently, but if they work too differently from a priority list (from the entity and based on the crowd sourced campaigns) without a good reason (like a serious bug in the protocol), people would stop donating money to that campaigns.\n\n\nHopefully we can find a good way to continue to fund the developers. \n\n\n": 4, 'To be fair, *some* construction does get priced by the square foot.

There was also a running count kept of how many unique tickets you\'d closed (unique as in "those identical tickets that keep coming up for simple routine tasks, they only count once") and that determined the allocation of a small bonus. \n\nIt wasn\'t a badly paid job in the least, so it wasn\'t a high pressure system, but it was a minor incentive towards certain tickets... there were some routine tasks that had unique ID numbers attached, so they would count for a point every time.

This week, however, the Kentucky senator and darling of the Tea Party is carving out new frontiers in finance. Announcing a 2016 presidential bid on Tuesday, he said he would collect donations via bitcoin. That makes him the first US presidential candidate to raise funds using the cryptocurrency. The move is likely to be wildly popular with his libertarian supporters, given the Republican party\xe2\x80\x99s deep suspicions of fiat currency and the US Federal Reserve.\n>\n>To understand what is going on, think for a moment about the six-year-old bitcoin technology. Cryptocurrencies are often described in popular culture, and by Mr Paul\xe2\x80\x99s Tea Party followers, as \xe2\x80\x9celectronic money\xe2\x80\x9d. But it is better to visualise them as financial ledgers \xe2\x80\x94 a public record book that keeps track of how many units of the currency each user\xe2\x80\x99s bitcoin \xe2\x80\x9cwallet\xe2\x80\x9d contains. \n>\n>The ledger is mathematically signed in a way that prevents unauthorised doctoring. To own a bitcoin is to possess a secret code that identifies you as the holder of a particular wallet, to whose contents the public ledger (or \xe2\x80\x9cblockchain\xe2\x80\x9d) attests. Trust in the system is created not by a third party (a central bank, say, as with official currencies) but by a type of cryptography. This can make bitcoin a store of value (albeit a lousy one recently; the price has roughly halved in the past 12 months). \n>\n>But the cryptoledger can also be used to make financial transactions through blockchain technology, which has three notable features. First, in theory a blockchain can execute transactions instantly. Second, blockchains can also perform transactions anonymously. Third, transactions can occur without the need to use third parties, or pay fees to a bank or clearing house. That is because the \xe2\x80\x9ccost\xe2\x80\x9d of running the bitcoin network is borne by the anonymous owners of servers that connect computer code in exchange for receiving new bitcoins as the system expands (this is known as \xe2\x80\x9cmining\xe2\x80\x9d). \n>\n>These features make the system attractive for retail-style trades and money transfers, legitimate and illicit. But they could theoretically be useful for financial markets. Bankers often say they are at the cutting edge of innovation, but many of the systems they use are lamentably old-fashioned. It can take days, and significant fees, to settle trades in loans or derivatives. That makes the system ripe for disruption. \n>\n>And some names are already jumping in. Last month, Blythe Masters, the former JPMorgan banker, unveiled a company called Digital Asset Holdings to develop bitcoin-based settlement systems. Don Wilson, a Chicago markets luminary, and Sunil Hirani, a derivatives and exchanges veteran, are also working with the company. Separately, JPMorgan Chase has applied for a patent for a technology that sounds similar to bitcoin; and patents are pending from other banks and financial groups.\n>\n>It remains to be seen if these initiatives succeed. One obstacle is that the stance of regulators is unclear. Another is that the bitcoin name carries stigma because the currency has sometimes been used by criminals. Then there is the issue of anonymity. DAH says it wants to provide much-needed transparency for bitcoin. This will be hard in a system organised by anonymous computer scientists \xe2\x80\x94 unless DAH itself becomes a third-party intermediary and charges fees, in which case part of the attraction of bitcoin disappears. \n>\n>Such problems do not deter the enthusiasts; after all, they point out, most financial innovations appear unlikely to take root at first. When people such as Ms Masters developed credit derivatives three decades ago, for example, they seemed truly bizarre. \n>\n>So perhaps the real lesson for investors is that the focus on \xe2\x80\x9cinnovation\xe2\x80\x9d is changing: in an ultra-low interest rate world, the idea of creating financial products looks less exciting. It is boring back-office technology that is the new innovation frontier. Consider it another consequence of the peculiar post-crisis financial system \xe2\x80\x94 or, as Mr Paul\xe2\x80\x99s supporters might argue, an era when money is so distorted that normal assumptions are turned upside down. \n>\n>gillian.tett@ft.com \n': 5}, ('Email from LEOcoin shill.....and my response.', 0): {'K': 1}, ('Chase CEO Worried About Bitcoin Stealing Business', 208): {'The original article, construed as bitcoiners trying to "eat [their] lunch," and now this one, were both twisted to make them sound like something they weren\'t. \n\nThe original article was actually in reference to silicon valley, and he actually welcomed their competition in the spirit of capitalism.
