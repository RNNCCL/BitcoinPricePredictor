It's because of these unique and useful features that a bitcoin has a market value of $230.\n\nAny closed ('permissioned blockchain') crypto-currency is by nature centralized and would lose these unique and useful features.

Where banks have licenses and oversight ensuring trust when they send debits and credits between themselves, the account ledger database system, person to person transactions lack that level of authentication so we must, to economically interact individually, engage an intermediary such as paypal, vendmo, googlepay, etc. which has their own system of authentication and trust we are bootstrapping our transaction to.  \nSo my understanding, which I admit maybe lost in my own imaginations inaccuracies, would be that cryptocurrency takes the trust factor and instead of placing it in the hands of a third party it instead relies upon the algorithm....in my mind checking the serial numbers of the imaginary bills as it reassigns them from your account to theirs.  \nSo while walmart giftcards can be used at walmart and verified by walmart, and walbux would provide little advantage to them....   \nA network of independent businesses, collectively backing a closed cryptocurrency.....or a small town creating a localized cryptoeconomy....WOULD, seemingly benefit from the implementation  \n\n': 2, 'Instead of your walmart example, where the private coin is managed by one company, imagine a dozen or so Banks that have their own currency.

One way to do that is to preserve the current block size limit.\n\nI've seen this line of reasoning many times, yet it makes no sense.

At today's exchange rate, the block subsidy will be a mere 25% of what it is today.\n\nUnless some fundamental changes take place in mining, few miners will remain after such drops. Yet the network must be secured against majority hash rate attackers.\n\nThe only thing currently available to take the place of the missing revenue is transaction fees. But those would have to be much higher than today to make up for the missing revenue. One way to do that is to preserve the current block size limit.\n\nThere's another angle. The technical difference between increasing the block size limit and increasing the money supply cap is practically insignificant. Both are hard forks.
