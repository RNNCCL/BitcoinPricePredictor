Obviously these people would be very upset at having their BTC become nearly worthless.  But wanting your assets to stay valuable doesn't make it happen.  Whether these people switch or not is irrelevant.  Then you have the small number of people who actually use BTC regularly and the merchants who accept them.  Both of these groups (customers and merchants) don't much care what crypto they're using.  The customer just buys the crypto on an exchange or with coinbase and then spends it at a merchant, and the merchant generally instantly converts it back to fiat.  Doing the same with a different altcoin would make no difference.  Personally if Silk Road started only taking Litecoin, I'd switch to litecoin instantly.  Then you have the miners - they'll mine whatever is profitable.  Many miners already mine a bunch of altcoins.\n\nAs for fixing bitcoin vs switching - the problem is that miners control the network so miners won't allow changes that hurt them.  For example, bitcoin will never go from proof of work to proof of stakes because that would devalue the massive investment in hardware that miners have made.

This doesn\'t apply to Gox because they weren\'t in the business of making loans. They had a bunch of customer USD and a bunch of customer bitcoins and they were supposed to all be there.\n\nIf it had just been a fractional reserve then although he wouldn\'t have been able to pay out if everybody asked for their money simultaneously, the bankruptcy trustee would ultimately be able to sell off assets (loans or whatever) and give everybody their money back.': 26, 'Another more plausible theory is that MtGox was fined by 75 mln in 2013\n\nhttp://bitcoinmagazine.com/4432/coinlab-sues-mtgox/': 3, "Exactly, until cryptocurrency, the entire financial system was based on trust.\n\nNow a sliver of it (crypto-based transactions with no third parties) is based on trustless computer science hashing.\n\nThe next innovation we're seeing is proof-of-reserves, which I would argue, still has an element of trust involved.\n\nImagine a future where you DON'T have to trust anyone due to our systems and organizations being designed that way.\n\nHow awesome would that be?": 4, 'Another very curious question that\'s burning in my mind is "Who was the owner of the 100,000 bitcoin account that was originally hacked in 2011?"

Wouldn\'t that be the ideal person to approach? \n\nI\'m actually working on a script for a MTGOX film that depicts this very story.

Hell, if MTGOX fails, bitcoin could go down with it. What if I told you we could both make out on this and save bitcoin at the same time? Put this all behind us.\n\nEarly Adoper: Get to the point, Karpeles. Fast. \n\nKarpeles: I\'m in control of this exchange, right? I can push the price up. I can push it down.

I can make this money back in fees and pay you back in no time and then I take this thing to the moon, but I can\'t do it by myself.

Open access to people who may try to scam you is better because it allows people to learn how to protect themselves.\n\nWorse still, the people who block out the "scammers" can be corrupted.

Classic pump and dump.  The next day more and more shares kept getting released as people bought them up.  Then a month later he said that because of all the trolls on Yahoo Finance (he was suing about 20 commenters there) he was postponing his stock buy back plans.  He never did buy those shares.  I'm more shocked that this isn't that same guy.\n\nIf anyone is curious they can follow the exploits of that guy [here](http://attrition.org/errata/charlatan/gregory_evans/).  It may help in seeing the sort of stuff people like Josh Garza pull all the time.": 33, '> I agree with everything you\'ve said except two things. First, I don\'t get to decide what everyone is responsible for. People choose their own responsibilities.\n\nOf course, what I (and each and every one of us, including the organizers of BTC miami) get to do is choose who we do business with.  I wouldn\'t do business with Josh Garza; it sounds like you wouldn\'t either.  The organizers of BTC Miami, however, would.  Why the discrepancy?  That apparent difference in values makes me hesitant to do business with BTC miami as well, which would mean not supporting their conference.  So in other words, I do (up to a certain extent) get to decide what everyone else is responsible for in so far as I get to control my relationship with them, including whether or not I do business with them.  It doesn\'t extend beyond that, but it certainly does extend that far.  That\'s entirely under my control, and thus my responsibility.  \n\n> Second, creating an opportunity for Josh Garza to address the evidence which suggests he is a scammer should be applauded rather than condemned. He may intend to promote his scam, but anyone who attends could easily hand out flyers with the evidence above, and they can ask him to talk about this. The organizers themselves may decide to interview Josh.\n\nI highly doubt the attendees of the conference are his main target.  His target audience, at least imo, is naive internet denizens who are more likely to believe in the legitimacy of his operation due to its association with a very legitimate sounding bitcoin conference.  An air of legitimacy is invaluable to a scam, after all, and that\'s what I believe he is purchasing.  Of course, if the whole thing blows up publicly enough then it could end up hurting their operation regardless, but the fact is anyone willing to think critically about their operation should be pretty alarmed by the whole thing, so I doubt critical thinkers are their target audience.  They\'re going after the lowest common denominator, and simply being associated with a "major" conference helps him earn credibility with that faction imo.  It\'s one (small) step up from the target demographic of nigerian prince emails.  I just looked at the "hashtalk" website today and the first thread I saw was a 16 year old kid telling people to have faith in their investment.  That\'s probably more indicative of the target demographic than the attendees of a $300/head bitcoin conference, and being listed as a sponsor/speaker there probably helps convince that kid this is legit.\n': 2, 'The mature thing to do is rent a dongcopter.': 21, 'Agreed, in circumstances like this, people need to show that they have more integrity, and that he is bereft of it.

I want to read headlines that say.\n\n"Entire hall walks out as GAW representatives get up on stage", or, " Half the audience turns their backs during entire GAW presentation", not "Crowd turns feral on one of their own", or, "Dozens of conference attendees thrown out at GAW presentation due to troublemakers".\n\nThe organisers should be thoroughly vetting anyone that they invite to talk or approve to give talks at the conference, instead they\'ve done the opposite and are trying to "let the community decide" which is entirely inappropriate, GAW should not be given a platform where the only ones that get to scrutinise the speaker is the crowd that can be easily silenced, dismissed, ignored or outright lied to. The Miami organisers should be doing this ahead of time because that\'s what their job is, they\'ve decided to organise a conference where they are actively drawing together reputed, respected, and on-the-level professionals to discuss, teach, and share their expertise on the subject that is Bitcoin. \n\nThe organisers need to be taking a leadership role on this situation rather than give the guy even more airtime on the stage. \n\n': 9, 'tomatoes !': 5, '> Then the last thing you want to do is give anyone authority to decide what they are allowed to have access to because they can be corrupted, and will as we see with all government protection agencies.

This arrangement resembles paid advertising imo much more than "free and open access to information", with the general idea behind a good conference being that you give publicity to interesting and relevant ideas to the topic of the conference.

I am concerned with not helping shady people trick others.  That\'s due to my own values, and I reserve the right to judge others in whatever way I see appropriate for not sharing those values.  Obviously I can\'t force them to share my values, but I can certainly control my association with others.  That\'s what a boycott is about - a voluntary and non-violent way of expressing disapproval of some entity\'s actions.  Whether or not an entity maintaining business associations with likely scammers is a problem for you is entirely up to you.\n\n> If someone doesn\'t research their investment plans, or if someone accepts an argument because it is being said at a legitimate sounding bitcoin conference, then that\'s a personal mistake.\n\nI don\'t disagree with that, but I don\'t consider that mutually exclusive with the thought that accepting conference sponsorship from at least what I consider to be a pretty obvious scam is a mistake as well.  If someone comes trying to sell me something that I think is obviously stolen, I personally would not buy it as doing so would be against my personal values and thus I would consider it a mistake.  This has the added benefit of contributing to lower demand for stolen goods, and lower demand = lower value and thus a lower incentive to steal (it may be an incremental effect, but incremental is not zero).  This all has nothing to do with any mistake the original owner may have made with getting it stolen.

There still is a tiny risk of getting cheated even with this configuration but it is rare and relatively random. Thus the disincentive to the attacker is that if success in double spending only rarely occurs, each failed attempt is a profitable sale to the merchant and thus in the long run it is unprofitable for the attacker and profitable for the merchant.\n\nThere are circumstances where a merchant is more vulnerable. An unattended coin change machine at a laundromat, for instance, would be the worst case scenario for the merchant. The attacker loses nothing for failed attempts (presuming the machine is not taking any profit from each "sale"), takes the gains on the occasional successful attempt, and is not likely to get caught for committing fraud as by the time the laundromat operator is aware anything happened the thief is long gone. (Of course, countering this is the likelihood that blockchain monitoring would have identified the numerous double spend attempts and thus the laundromat operator can prevent even this from occurring.)\n\nThe Finney attack also has costs that make it less of a threat than it would seem. Holding a block costs about a dollar a second. So if once a block is mined but not broadcast and it then takes the thief forty seconds to complete the transaction with the merchant, there had better be a lot more than $40 worth of profit from doing so otherwise the attempt ends up being uneconomical over the long run. Again, the merchant would know eventually that the double spend had occurred (measured in seconds, if monitoring the blockchain), so this doesn\'t work well in circumstances where the thief risks getting caught. So the prevention for this is to simply not make large value transactions (e.g., hundred dollars or more) on 0/unconfirmed without some delay where you are watching for double spending.\n\nThe 51% attack that would reverse confirmed transactions is so expensive and thus such a remote chance of it occurring, it is not even of concern for a typical merchant. (i.e., someone spending millions of dollars to double spend using this attack vector, if it ever happens, is going to go after trades where large exchanges of value which occur -- think gold bullion traded for bitcoins under a bridge at midnight.

Running a full node requires downloading every transaction performed on the Bitcoin network. People already complain about the large block chain size. Would *you* run a full node if you had to store 5 TB of data per year and constantly download and upload data at a rate of 170+ kB/s? (These are the numbers for 100 MB blocks -- about 300 transactions per second.) If an increase in the maximum transaction rate (related to the max block size) causes almost no one to run full nodes, then Bitcoin will no longer be secure for anyone.\n\nSoftware changes can improve this to some degree. In particular, block pruning (probably in Bitcoin Core 0.11), UTXO-trees-in-blocks, and Gavin's improved block propagation will significantly reduce the load on full nodes. But this stuff takes time to develop, there will still be a limit to what the network can handle, and it will probably be lower than you want. We just have to learn to deal with increased transaction fees (using off-chain transactions, etc.) if we want Bitcoin to remain useful. Simply increasing the allowed number of transactions because we want more transactions would either destroy Bitcoin outright or cause it to become largely centralized, which eliminates its main benefit over other currencies and payment systems.\n\nWhat I support, and what I think will happen (more or less) over the next decade is:\n\n* Fees will continue to increase slowly as the demand for Bitcoin transactions increases.\n* This will drive the creation of cheaper and easier to use off-chain transaction systems. Changetip is an example of an off-chain transaction system, though you can use cryptography to make these systems far safer, more anonymous, and more transparent than the basically bank-like services that exist today.\n* People will use native/on-chain Bitcoin for transactions above $10 or so, and off-chain transaction systems for smaller amounts. Tools will be created to switch between Bitcoin and off-chain transactions seamlessly so that end-users don't need to worry much about the difference.\n* Once pruning and a few other things are added to Bitcoin Core, the maximum block size will be increased to 5-10MB, and a very conservative automatic adjustment of the max block size will be added. (The exact numbers here are controversial.)\n* Whenever the Bitcoin network is improved to be significantly more efficient, or when the average worldwide bandwidth increases significantly, the max block size will be manually adjusted upward more quickly than the automatic adjustment calls for.\n* Bitcoin fees will therefore be kept under control even as demand increases, though they'll probably always be too high to support microtransactions. Off-chain transactions will always need to be part of the Bitcoin ecosystem. At times, especially in the next 2-3 years while the technology isn't quite there yet, fees might become uncomfortably high.

Depending on the exact costs, it might be possible for some payment processors to operate on donations.\n\nMaybe this will all fall apart. You never know.

This is to prevent a naughty miner from publishing a massive block (inflated with made up transactions) and forcing everyone to save it. However, there are now so many transactions on the network that this cap will eventually limit the capacity of the network.\nIt was always known that the cap would need to be raised, and it looks like that point might come in ~6 months [speculation]. If we hit the cap without raising it, miners will be forced to be more selective about which transactions they include in blocks, so the transaction fee needed to get a transaction processed in a reasonable time will increase.\nThe reason that changing this limit is a big deal is that most people on the network must agree to the change (it is consensus critical). Let's say 1/3 of people don't agree with the change and carry on running the old software. When a new large block is published, they will ignore it while the other 2/3 accept it.

It is the most useless middleman ever invented.\n\nOn the other side of the aisle is BitPay, whose current business model seems to be selling bitcoins to coinbase and hoping to get bought by someone.\n\nChangetip, who postponed their (insufficient for survival) fees yet again after a lifesaver was tossed to them by Pantera (who is now also the largest user of the service and greatly inflating their average tip amount stats) still struggles to go viral in a market that is littered with failed attempts to monetize something people don\'t want monetized.\n\nThe common denominator with all of these things is "who is going to pay for it when the subsidies end." I have not seen a good answer to that from anybody because the solution to one problem (dodging increasing fees and transaction limits by going off chain) makes the other problem worse (miners relying on higher fees from more transactions to keep the network going as the subsidies fade).': 1, 'You seem to be pushing off chain transactions as a way to dodge ever increasing transaction fees. The fees currently are held in check by low demand and mining subsidies.\n\nThe unspoken point that you left out is that the zero/low transaction fees currently being provided by off chain solutions are also being kept artificially low because they are being subsidized by venture capital. It seems like depending on the continued existence of this subsidy, especially without a massive increase in consumer interest fairly soon, to sidestep a looming fee problem with the bitcoin network is a risky proposition.\n\n(this is completely ignoring that you are proposing entrenching centralized third party middlemen as a way to keep the network from becoming centralized.)': 0, 'If there is not a long-term incentive it won\'t work. This is actually part of a larger problem, which is the balance of power between miners and non-mining public who are typically consumers. Right now miners could, if they wanted, refuse to actually accept any transactions at all and earn money from it.\n\nWhen they mine a block they get two things:\n\n* The "coinbase" which is how the first coins ever released were made. Miners make X amount of BTC from the block as a subsidy and that amount halves every 4 years based on the protocol. I think it\'s still 25BTC or it\'s halved to 12.5 BTC by now.\n\n* The sum of all the transaction fees. This is any of the transactions that were included in the block by the miner.\n\nRight now that 25BTC subsidy is much much more than the sum of the transaction fees. If a miner wanted they could publish the block with nothing in it and get the 25BTC effectively attacking the network while getting paid.\n\nOver time the subsidy goes down and the sum of transactions will go up (due to volume) but it\'s an interesting dilemma.': 1}, ("HOW ABOUT TO CREATE A SPECIFIC MINI COMPUTER FOR RUNNING A FULL NODE AND EVERY HOST SHOULD BE PAY'DE FOR IT?", 1): {'my computer its too damn loud and  powerconsumption is high': 0, "I'm on mobile, so sorry no links, but there are plenty of scripts to start up a full node on aws ec2 or on your own fresh Debian install.

Talking with some people who dislike money, but don't really know why (Communists), prompted me -- someone who generally likes money -- to think about what problems there might be which are intrinsic to money, as opposed to what came before (presumably brain-memory accounting for favours, which is also what communists advocate when they talk of a 'gift economy'). I figured that it is actually the fungibility of money that is the problem (though it also confers some benefits simultaneously). Infungible money could actually be a good thing in a stateless or otherwise liberal society, as it would allow individuals to discriminate against what money they would accept based on how that money had been transacted in the past, but also -- on the negative side -- it would allow the State to more easily force people into not accepting certain units of a money whether they otherwise wanted to or not.\n\nThe potential infungibility of Bitcoin could actually be beneficial when we achieve a stateless society, but people would be able to use the same ledger for both traceable and untraceable (fungible and infungible) transactions simultaneously; and other people could choose whether or not to accept either traceable or untraceable Bitcoins. The great thing with Bitcoin, is that you, the user are always in control over whether or not to make your transactions traceable. In order to make their transactions traceable, people would have to voluntarily choose to not use mixers, to associate their identity with their wallet, etc.. And so, people who wanted to make sure they were not doing favours for people who obtained their money (favour IOU's) in ways they consider unjust, would be able to avoid doing so.\n\nA fungible Bitcoin would achieve everything communists desire through a money-less society and a gift economy, but without suffering from a lack of memory to suffice beyond Dunbar's number of 150 social relationships.

And the content creator starts seeding with this torrent client that will only share torrent pieces with other clients that pay.\n\nAt this point I believe what happens could be along these lines for the downloading side.\n\nSome user in some other country has this same torrent client, he has already setup a Bitcoin wallet, he\'s funded the wallet with about USD $10 in Bitcoin, he performs a search and he sees some search results, and then there\'s this one fresh result which shows as a paid torrent. Since he has setup his client to work by default in USD, he\'ll see the price of the torrent in USD and in parenthesis the current price in BTC.\n\nAt this point, there\'s only one seed, the original one (and there might be other people about to make the same decision if the content creator is actively promoting the .torrent, or if it makes it to the news, think... 50 cent is releasing an album on a paid torrent)\n\nThe user starts the download and is asked to enter the password protecting the private key, the torrent client gets the .torrent, sees that there are 145 pieces, and by the time the transfer is about to start, after scraping the tracker it realizes there\'s already 20 seeds.\nThe .torrent also says that it\'s been configured to share 5% of the payment with seeders.\n\nIDEALLY, at this point the client could setup a series of Bitcoin transactions with inputs and outputs corresponding to the address of the content creator with 95% of the payment per piece and 5% to the seeders, when handshaking with seeders we could ask them for their addresses but here\'s where my nightmares begin:\n\nWhen are payments sent? \nAfter pieces are received?  \nI think it\'s a no-no sending the payment before hand as the seeder might get disconnected. \nAt the same time the seeder risks sending a piece and having the client not pay for it, so you start thinking of multisig for escrow, but who the hell can be picked as escrow (you want to keep it distributed, but it\'s also risky to be an escrow as you could be an accomplice for criminal copyright infringement, there will always be morons trying to make money off of pirated content)\n\nMaybe there could be a mechanism upon which a seeder could challenge the downloader if he doesn\'t get paid for the piece sent, letting all the other seeders to not send any data unless a signed transaction is on the blockchain for the piece that was sent. \nI read the transaction output script supports an OP_RETURN operation that has 40 bytes available which can be used for metadata. If there\'s another way to add metadata to the transaction, please let me know, as I think the following information would be pretty useful to have, for quick verification, and also for looking up transactions quickly related to downloaders and specific torrents they may have paid for in the past.\n\ntorrent_info_hash : 20 bytes.\npiece_sha1 : 20 bytes.\n\nWith these 2 pieces of information, along with the transaction information (seeder\'s btc address), and the fact the transaction is signed by the downloader, peers in the swarm could verify the piece has been paid for, at this point I have a big issue to solve, which is, how do we know the user didn\'t pay himself and he\'s pretending to be a seeder... should 100% of payments be sent to content owner\'s address, is there a way to maybe do this with multisignature addresses?\n\nNow, a torrent may have hundreds of pieces, so imagine the number of transactions burdening the blockchain, there will be many cases upon which (to save space on the blockchain) you might want to group several piece payments into a single transaction... so many questions that could be answered by a Bitcoin expert.\n\nI also think that if a user has already paid for a torrent once, he should be able to download the file over and over as long as he can prove with his bitcoin signature that a piece has already been paid for, in this case, the seeders would have to be altruistic and serve pieces that have already been paid for to others.\n\nSo those are my thoughts so far. would love some feedback, might be able to put something like this together during the hackathon if the process can be simplified.': 1, 'Nothing will ever kill piracy.': 0, '>That will change.\n\nYep.
