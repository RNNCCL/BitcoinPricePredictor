They couldn't get transactions through. At the very least there should be some response to this from core in terms of establishing a timeline to test a solution, a fall back position, and so on. No one knows what the best answer is, but there isn't even an agreed timeline or set of approaches right now - just a bunch of people who have argued about it incessantly for a very long time.\n\nAs Bitcoin users, we should want and deserve better. Without progress, at some point I can see Bitcoin genuinely being forked, and really splitting the user base between those who don't want change and those who do.\n\nThis isn't about whether the XT approach to block size is the answer, it's about the lack of any progress whatsoever in terms of dealing with this problem and forward moving development in general.": 5, 'The paper contains several statements that aren\'t actually true, but they\'re quite common misconceptions:\n\n> \xe2\x80\xa2 Trustworthiness of Bitcoin XT is lower, as it is not subject to code reviews and does not have a formal verification process, which are a key part of Bitcoin Core development.\n\nAll code in XT is peer reviewed just like Core. The XT review process has been working better than Core: the BIP 101 code was submitted to both projects for review, but only the XT review process found actual bugs and made real improvements. The code review on the Core side was largely ignored.\n\nYou can go look at the pull request queue to see the process in action, if you doubt this claim.\n\nBitcoin Core is not formally verified and formal methods are not a "key part of Bitcoin Core development". I don\'t know where this idea comes from. Most of the code base isn\'t even unit tested, let alone formally verified.\n\nCore uses exactly the same testing and QA methods as XT, which is not surprising as they are almost identical and some of the QA/testing framework in Core was actually written by myself and Gavin (e.g. Gavin made the testnet, I wrote regtest mode).\n\n> \xe2\x80\xa2 Unlike Bitcoin Core, Bitcoin XT developers don\xe2\x80\x99t plan to use a consensus mechanism to approve changes.\n\nBitcoin Core does not use consensus to make decisions either, regardless of how many times you may hear this claim. It has a maintainer, Wladimir van der Laan, who has explicitly stated just last Monday that consensus is not important for most changes to the code, and he considers the block chain rules to be [like "the laws of physics"](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2015-June/009137.html) i.e. cannot be changed by anyone regardless of how many people agree.\n\nI describe this in more detail (with supporting quotes) in this article:\n\nhttps://medium.com/@octskyward/an-xt-faq-38e78aa32ff0\n\nand the XT launch article:\n\nhttps://medium.com/@octskyward/why-is-bitcoin-forking-d647312d22c1\n\nEveryone loves the idea that Bitcoin Core is developed through a congenial consensus of civilised experts. And because Wladimir hardly communicates, it can easily look like that. The reality is that he makes decisions just like in any open source project, and the last time he wrote publicly on the topic he decided he doesn\'t want the block size to rise. End of story.\n\n> \xe2\x80\xa2 The developer team of Bitcoin XT is significantly smaller than the team working on Bitcoin Core. It raises concerns as to whether they are able to objectively assess changes being adopted into Bitcoin XT.\n\nAs you can see from the variety of faces in the github commit list, there are plenty of people contributing to XT:\n\nhttps://github.com/bitcoinxt/bitcoinxt/commits/master\n\nOr take a look at this pull req and the variety of reviewers it\'s got:\n\nhttps://github.com/bitcoinxt/bitcoinxt/pull/35\n\n(hint: I\'m not one of them)\n\nThe XT project has already attracted experienced developers, and myself and Gavin have been doing Bitcoin development longer than the entire Bitcoin Core team except for Jeff. We\'ve also done a lot more of it: check the amount of code we\'ve both written.\n\n> One could argue that the development process used in Bitcoin XT would allow for faster changes than Bitcoin Core; however, in our view, this advantage does not outweigh the drawbacks\n\nThe issue with Core is not "changes are made slowly and carefully", the issue is that they\'re often not being made at all, and for spurious reasons. \n\nIn the case of the block size limit there has been *no* progress towards making a decision on the block size. No decision point is defined, and no time limit for the debate is specified. Given the current way things are done it may quite literally run forever.\n\nI realise that people really, really like the idea that Bitcoin software development does not depend on the technical judgement of one or two people. Unfortunately, despite appearances that\'s exactly how it currently works with Bitcoin Core, and XT exists because that judgement has become very problematic.\n\nIn the long run it could make sense to make XT governance more formal, like in an IETF working group. But before we can form a committee or a more formal decision making body, there must be focused agreement on the actual goals of the project.': 62, "If you run a full (XT) node on the same computer as Lighthouse, it'll use that.

A spam attack is meant to fill up the mempool due to over-crowded blocks which slows down confirmation time.

Sampling some full nodes would be sybil-attackable (although I think Lighthouse has some mitigations) but the protection from losing money that way is already in the smart contract mechanisms, as it has to be since if you take action based on UTXOs they may be gone by the time you've finished whatever you're doing.": 3, 'Absence of proof is not proof of absence.': 3, '> But before we can form a committee or a more formal decision making body, there must be focused agreement on the actual goals of the project.\n\nThis strikes me as the root cause of the problem.': 2, "> There has been no decision made unless you count not doing anything about the known problem a decision.\n\nWho are you to say it's not a decision?

In the paper:\n\n>>Elevated hardware requirements could result in a substantial percentage of full nodes dropping\nfrom the network should the block size increase to 8 MB right now.\n\nThis statement makes the statement that nodes would drop off the network should the block size increase to 8mb *right now*.\n\nI've read most of this discussion, but no where have I seen any valid research that shows that just because the block size is raised that the blocks will be filled.\n\nAll the research I've seen so far, and please correct me if im wrong, shows that miners are incentivized to keep blocks small for propagation reasons.\n\nAre there any economic advantages to *filling up* the blocks? Wouldn't it *cost money* for a miner to pad the block with dummy transactions to increase its size?\n\nWouldn't this present not only a economic disadvantage (the cost of filling the block) but also a increased orphan risk due to the size increase?\n\nThe other side of me wants to argue that *because the capability will exist that someone will test it*, and therefore some spam attack or something will occur that increases the block size to the max, but wouldn't the cost of such a increase (going from 1mb of dummy transactions to 8mb) isolate the possible foul players from participating in such a on-going attack? It seems it would be *very expensive* to keep this type of attack on-going, and to no purpose that I can see other than perhaps negative impact marketing in a attempt to vocalize support for LN or off-chain networks?\n\nIm not trying to vocalize support for BIP101 vs BIP100, but I cant help but think that adding further consensus mechanisms beyond what already exists, and handing the power over to miners could be a mistake long term. Absolute power corrupts absolutely, and the more power we give miners the more incentivized they are to utilize that power to create the most economic incentive for their personal interests. I think that most of the time their personal interests will align with the public good, but it seems that there has been enough research on the topic to show that there *are* actions like *selfish mining* whereby miners do things negative to the network for personal gain. If we give the miners more power now, then it will be near-impossible to take it back (without a hard fork, but with the miners controlling the longest chain, how would that be possible?).\n\nIf the research is correct, and the miners do keep blocks to their appropriate sizes based on current market transactional output, then we wouldn't even reach 2mb by the end of 2016, making this whole argument about nodes dropping off silly. I run a raspberry pi node and it runs great, and I think it will run great for years yet, even with BIP 101 because it does not need to handle network traffic that does not exist. Blocksize limit != increased transactional volume. I can always add another drive to my pi, but the bottleneck is in the RAM. Increased network transactions/UXTO space will result in more need for RAM and that is when the PI will no longer keep up. I dont see that happening for years, regardless of whether the blocksize was increased to 8mb or 1GB tomorrow.\n\nThis is a little off-topic from the point above, but its always going through my mind. People rely upon miners to act honestly as its in their best interests to ensure the network is healthy, but dont most miners cash their coin to pay for overhead? I know there are no real numbers, but it seems that with the advent of centralized mining, more elite miners are the ones contributing to total hashpower, and a lot of these people are cashing out their rewards. This makes them essential to providing hashing power to the network, but they are no longer investors at this point and they will do whats best for their short-term economic outlook, not long-term. This assumption that all miners are going to do whats right is based on the false assumption that all miners are investors. This is faulty logic IMO.": 5, 'Ah, so Lighthouse does not run a full node?': 2, 'I always though that dynamic block sizes are best if that option is on the table.

There is common understanding among Bitcoin developers that the current limit of one megabyte limits scalability of Bitcoin and could prevent its wider adoption. This opinion is further supported by mathematical modeling that shows long transaction confirmation delays as the block size approaches its limit.\n\n>Elevated hardware requirements could result in a substantial percentage of full nodes dropping from the network should the block size increase to 8 MB right now. This makes an argument against proposals to raise the maximum block size in a single big jump. Similarly, proposals implying a fork of client software could have negative consequences for the whole Bitcoin ecosystem. Jeff Garzik\xe2\x80\x99s BIP 100 and Pieter Wuille\xe2\x80\x99s proposal are sound in both these aspects. \n\n>The optimal way to solve the block size debate is by a consensus decision; the voting mechanism introduced in BIP 100 is a good way to implement such a consensus. Forecasts for the growth of the Bitcoin network made by other proposals don\xe2\x80\x99t have enough predictive power, and in this case, the cost of a mistake is high. As BIP 100 lets members of Bitcoin community decide the block size limit, it is the best solution in this regard.\n\n>Because of the stated reasons, we consider BIP 100 to be the most prudent choice to grow the block size limit in the near-to-intermediate term.

If it can't scale to country-wide, then we need LN to scale that way, and if LN can't do country wide then we go horizontal.\n\nMy argument that LN is not a good solution is not because of the scalability it can provide but because of the loss of control and also the initial fee you need to pay to get in (in a high fee environment). It needs to work together with layer 0, not price it out completely. It is not great as an entire replacement for Bitcoin because the hub locking your funds longer than you can afford, when you get the chance to resolve the dispute via the blockchain you then pay a massive fee, forcing you to really 'stick to the game' by joining another hub. So you need the blocksize to increase so LN users can exit the system and still be able to use Bitcoin comfortably without paying massive fees.\n\nIt is great for subscription based payments (pay once to a hub, subscribe to many services). That is where I see LN really shines.\n\nEdit: I'm at work, so if something sounds rushed/doesn't make sense sry.

For Bitcoin to retain trustworthy, it must not be possible to shut it down by shutting down a couple of servers.

They form the peer-to-peer backbone of Bitcoin. Without nodes, Bitcoin cannot exist.\n\nThe number of nodes is declining. Currently there are only about 6000 nodes worldwide. Running a node requires a lot of bandwidth, both up and downstream. The bandwidth required is proportional to the size of a block. If blocks become larger, the bandwidth requirements increase.

The more people who use it, the more useful it becomes. There are plenty of people out there who are perfectly happy with their current levels of financial privacy. They pay with cards when they have the option of paying with cash, etc, because they value other things more highly.

This is a conservative proposal for the following reason: a 80% vote threshold to increase the limit is substantial enough that it will effectively mean that only limit increase attempts that have wide consensus, and almost certainly support from reference implementation developers, will go into effect. For example, if there is a push to increase the limit that is rejected by Core developers, it's highly unlikely that more than 20% of the hashpower won't veto that attempt by voting against it.\n\nThis means that with BIP 100, the limit will only be possible to change with wide consensus, but without requiring the extreme level of consensus needed for a hard fork, which is a level that can only be reached through the community coalescing around a small number of influential 'leaders' that form what is effectively a centralized governing structure (e.g. the five Core committers, Gavin Andresen, etc).\n\nIn other words, making 80% of the hashpower the level needed for a change in the max block size hits the 'sweet spot' for how much consensus is needed.\n\nBIP 100 acknowledges that we do not know what the optimum block size limit is. It keeps our options open, and allows us to fine tune the limit to the best information at hand at the time. The BIP can and should be tweaked (to remove the 32 MB limit, and to mitigate the risks of a 21% attack), but IMHO, a proposal along its lines is the right direction to go in.

However if Bitcoin had a set of users (like large banks, or NASDAQ) who were willing to pay high fees for their transactions than it could make sense. \n\n[Here's a simple model](https://bitcoindebates.miraheze.org/wiki/For_large_blocks#At_a_lower_block_size.2C_a_sudden_increase_in_demand_is_more_likely_to_result_in_high_fees_than_at_a_larger_block_size) where a 1 MB block size would result in $5 fees, and an 8 MB block size would result in 1 cent fees. If demand looked like that and miners controlled the block size, they might set the limit at 1 MB (actually in that example they'd more likely set it just below 1.5 MB).\n\nMiners would get $10,000 per block in tx fees if they set the limit at 1 MB. At today's exchange rate, they'd also get $7,000 in block rewards.  At 8 MB, tx fees would only give them $160. So their short term decision is about whether to make $17,000 per block or $7,160.\n\nYou argue that moving to 8 MB would make the price higher than staying at 1 MB, but it's not obvious that it would. Maybe speculators would see that big banks were paying $5 per transaction and it'd give them even more confidence that Bitcoin is valuable and will be even more valuable in the future, so price could be higher at 1 MB. The speculators might never have known that big banks would pay such high fees if the block size stayed larger. Or let's say the price would double if miners switched to 8 MB. In that case it's still more profitable for miners to keep blocks at 1 MB.\n\nThis is an extreme example, but it shows the general point well.\n\nYou're right that it's the marginal miners whose profits are exactly zero. I don't want to dive into how easy or likely it is that large amounts of miners will have long term competitive advantages (but remember that the least profitable 21% of hash power could be the ones voting to reduce the block size) because it's not central to my point.\n\nWhat I was trying to get across is that if the Bitcoin price doubled, the huge windfall to existing miners would be short term. Overall the mining industry would start spending about 2x as much money as before to capture the extra block reward value. Maybe the best run mining operations would increase their profits, but as a whole the win for miners is less clear cut than miners just making 2x as much money.": 1, "Balanced compromise\n\nRational miners will vote to maximise their revenue.  When the block reward is low, this can be calculated from the following equation.\nMining revenue = the economic value of network security = bitcoin fx rate * transaction volume * average fee\n\nBIP100 is a balanced, dynamic and market driven compromise, which maximises the product of these three important metrics. Many people are arguing about the relative importance of these three metrics, BIP100 could be the long term solution we are after.\n\nReacting to demand\n\nBIP100 does reflect adoption/demand. If demand increases the price elasticity of demand may fall, therefore miners may vote to increase the limit. Miners vote to maximise their revenue and they therefore need to evaluate the price elasticity of demand when they vote.  BIP100 enables capacity to adjust to meet demand.  Over time miners will become better at voting.  This method is better than estimating what demand will look like now for the next 20+ years, which is very difficult for anybody to do.\n\nWhy can't miners apply their own voluntary size limit?\nFor example, a miner may prefer smaller blocks so that fees are higher. i.e. the miner thinks the negative impact from a reduction in volume would be smaller than the positive impact of a fee increase from the smaller blocks. Therefore the miner wants smaller blocks.\n\nHowever, the miner could make a large block anyway to benefit from larger fees in the short term, from that block, in the hope other miners make smaller blocks. This plan will fail because each miner will also operate in their own selfish interest and make larger blocks. Fees then downwardly spiral to zero and network security falls.\n\nThis is happening in the oil market right now, loss making oil companies are pumping more and more oil to get cash in the short term and the oil price keeps falling. Oil firms then get more desperate for short term cash. Each oil company hopes other firms will reduce production so the price increases, but the nash equilibrium is for each oil producer to keep pumping. We must not allow this race to the bottom to occur in bitcoin mining. Lets learn the lesson from oil production and the mining of other commodities.\n\nFor oil of course this does not matter, eventually oil firms go bankrupt and shut down, then supply falls and the oil price rises. This correction can not occur in bitcoin because supply does not correct. Bitcoin miners keep the network secure, they do not supply capacity. One remaining miner can provide all the capacity we need, but not the security. Due to this imbalance, a blocksize limit is required.\n\nIf the above is true, why fees are not zero now, despite blocks not being full?.\nIt is for the following four reasons:\nOrphan risk costs are high, however in the long term these may fall due to bandwidth improvements and other technology like IBLT.\nMining is not competitive enough. There are currently a few large pools, however if Bitcoin is to succeed in the long term, there needs to be many miners and a high level of competition.\nMiners are not mature businesses yet. Miners are often pro bitcoin people or bitcoin speculators, miners often care about the health of bitcoin. In the long term they may be more focused on margins and profit.\nThe block reward is high, therefore miners don't worry much about fee income as it is small relative to revenue. The block reward will fall in the long term and miners will therefore focus on maximising fee income.\n\nIs BIP100 like a price cartel?\n\nYes, BIP100 is like a cartel for price fixing in some ways. What BIP100 does is allow the price to be fixed as if a cartel like structure existed, but actually have many competing miners. This is why BIP100 is quite clever. It is ironic like Bitcoin in a way. Bitcoin is about achieving abosolute order, while at the time ensuring everyone has freedom to do what they want. BIP100 has cartel like pricing, but with many members who have freedom to do what they want.\n\nWithout BIP100, the only way for price fixing to occur is if there was a very small group of miners who controlled the network, like you said. BIP100 would not be needed then and the price would be fixed. Without BIP100, if there were too many miners the cartel would fall apart, as members would defect from the cartel.\n\nBIP100 kind of provides a framework for a cartel like structure to apply, but with many competing members. As Meni pointed out when BIP100 was released, under many assumptions as to what Bitcoin is for, this may mean volumes are too low or suboptimal. I still think BIP100 is the best proposal out there, although its far from perfect or even complete.\n\nList of points requiring further clarification\n\n1.

Suppose the community expressed explicit support for the ideas that a colluding mining majority would be punished with a change to the PoW, and that it was not appropriate to force a fee market so early in Bitcoin's life. In that case I'd guess there would be less than a 5% chance of a mining cartel forming within 5 years to keep block sizes low.\n\nWith BIP 100, I'd guess there would be about a 40% chance over the next 5 years that miners would collude to keep block sizes low because they thought it was in their financial interests.": 3, 'Please explain why it would make economic non technical sense to vote for smaller blocks now?\n\nWe always have a problem of miner short term vs long term intests.

Some people suggested making a good, well-tested implementation in Core, since miners were going to do it anyway.

Is this true or false?\n\nThis is also ignoring the bitcoin relay network, in which miners can do all sorts of things to pre-relay the block and then add the last nonce upon solving, making the whole \'big block\' vs \'little block\' argument in relation to orphans a moot point. Its great to see the mining network come up with solutions to solve orphanage rates like that. ': 3, "When your daytime job pays around $100K, that's not really an issue tho.

Do you mean each individual miner or the industy as a whole?  Remember each miner is different and may have different costs.  Some miners may have relitively stable long term profits driven by strong managment teams, for example.\n\nIf anyone can enter and exit the mining industry.  What you can assume, over a certain timeframe, is that the costs of the most marginal miner is equal to marginal costs.  Therefore the profits of the most marginal miner or highest cost miner, should be zero.\n\nHowever it is possible in some unlikely scenarios that a lower Bitcoin price could benefit some miners, if the industry cost curve has a certain shape.

Bitcoin is already vulnerable to complete destruction through a >50% attack that can invalidate the network's core security assumption: that a transaction confirmed by N number of blocks is irreversible. Therefore the attack vector adds practically no risk to the system, since a hostile majority could much more easily destroy Bitcoin through existing vectors.\n\nNow any new block size limit policy comes with risk. It's an unknown after all, and there's no way to know how it will turn out until it's used in a real world system. However, consider the alternatives:\n\n* Do no hard fork, keep the 1 MB limit forever: on the one side, significant risk of Bitcoin stagnation leading to its obsolescence, as less restricted blockchains supplant it, or legislatures turn the Bitcoin usage into a licensed activity, before widespread public buy-in can make such political attacks infeasible. On the other, massive risk of a faction within Bitcoin proceeding with a contentious hard fork that leads to the network fragmenting. **Risks**: obsolescence, fragmentation\n\n* Do frequent, small hard forks: Many have argued they would be easy and risky free, but we've never tried a hard fork that changes the block size limit. Even small can-kick hard forks could turn out to be extremely contentious as reaching an agreement on the exact timing of such hard forks, and extent by which they increase the limit, could  be elusive. One of these hard forks could end up leading to the network fragmenting. **Risks**: fragmentation\n\n* A pre-defined exponential increase in the limit: we don't know the future, yet such a solution would attempt to predict how fast bandwidth and demand will grow decades into the future. If the prediction is wrong, we could be stuck with a limit that is too low, which entails a massive opportunity cost, or worse, a subsequent contentious hard fork, or too high, which contributes to a dangerous increase in centralization. **Risks**: long term stifling of Bitcoin growth, fragmentation, centralization\n\nSo yes, there is risk in Bitcoin's future, with BIP 100 or any other proposal. I would argue that formalizing the process by which the max block size is changed, by incorporating it into the consensus rules, to vastly decrease the risk of needing to do a future hard fork to change the block size limit, is the most conservative option available.": -1, 'BIP100 is a play to try to kill the issue and pander to the people who ultimately decide the outcome while the bitcoin core devs preserve their power and keep their business alive.

It goes to state that this person therefore has a significant say and some control over mining fees.\n\nbut history shows that with basic filters in place (such as 0.0001BTC minimum fee), theres very little risk of blocks being completely filled when no miners have really bothered with that type of attack thus far\n\nthat said, fixed growth rate of blocksize cap that provides significant headroom should be implemented.
