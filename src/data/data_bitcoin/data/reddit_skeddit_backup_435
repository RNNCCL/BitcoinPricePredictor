If your customer's transactions really took 6 hours to confirm (for only the first confirmation?), that seems to indicate he paid with inadequate or no fee, immature coins, and/or the transaction relied on unconfirmed inputs. My thinking is that a properly designed merchant service platform should warn for any of these issues once they are seen. At the same time, a proper wallet should also notify the paying customer about these issues before sending a transaction, and if possible, compensate with an appropriate fee.  \n\nI've used Bitpay's merchant service interface several times to buy from Newegg and never had a problem. Those transactions were nearly instant and did not require a wait for a confirmation, but Newegg has plenty of time to cancel an order if a double-spend or other problem arises while they are preparing to ship. I've used Coinbase's merchant service platform to buy from eGifter a couple of times and that's when I discovered their problem accepting high-priority zero-fee transactions. A subsequent off-chain try with an amount from a Coinbase wallet had no problems (I have not tried again with a non-Coinbase wallet when including a fee).\n\nIf you're a brick-and-mortar merchant and need to deliver goods immediately, a direct zero-confirmation transaction for $1k+ would make me nervous (this shouldn't apply to you as you are using Coinbase). If your customer's payment was without any of the above mentioned issues, *and* if Coinbase's platform worked as advertised, the transaction should have completed nearly instantly. Purportedly, Coinbase's terms and conditions make them responsible for double-spends (though I don't know if any claims have been made and reimbursed by them in this regard), so a zero-confirmation transaction via Coinbase may be acceptable. On the other hand, my understanding is that BitPay does not cover double-spend risk, so accepting a large, in-person, zero-confirmation transaction using their merchant service platform would not be advisable.  \n\nAs for how common such issues are with Coinbase, I couldn't say. I'd recommend discussing it with their support (and perhaps getting escalated to speaking with a supervisor, the initial support reps aren't always completely up to speed on Bitcoin minutiae).

Then there\'s the halving which you all are preying will raise the price of your play money when in reality each halving is another nail in bitcoin\'s coffin because the subsidy is the only form of miner income.  Which brings me to the most hilarious topic of all, transaction fees earned has actually gone down in the last 2 years, not up which will eventually just force the entire mining infrastructure out of the ecosystem unless massive fees are paid.

I think the arrows and the single pair of hands increases the confusion because they "bridge" the two paradigms which are meant to be very distinct (also, it\'s not really clear what the arrows are representing). I would use less symmetry (both in position and in font, line, and "region" weight), and find some way to *not* make *everything* feel like a heading.

Scaling one thing can (and in this instance does) create bottlenecks and issues in other parts of the system. Perhaps the best comparison I can think of is with the scaling of databases. Maybe initially you can just put in faster disks, increase the RAM, and hope that a beefier server will cope. But that is a sucker\'s bet, as you don\'t know how much time you\'re buying yourself (if any). So often the approach to scaling databases isn\'t to just ramp up to the beefiest server you can get, but rather to stick to somewhat more accessible hardware, and shard the database. Ramping up the blocksize *does not scale the system*, given that there are potentially negative consequences to doing so.\n\n> That requires scaling the blocksize\n\nNobody is denying that the block size needs to increase. The issue is *when* and *by how much* (or perhaps tangentially: by what sort of dynamic scheme). Shouting "increase it to 20mb!" over and over like some sort of stuck cuckoo clock doesn\'t provide any room for further manoeuvre.

A 6-month hard fork window that adds a VERY slow dynamic increase to the block size. e.g. with Monero we have a look back over a period of blocks, we then get a block size median for that, and miners are allowed to create blocks that are slightly bigger than the median (thus the median increases or decreases over time). This should allow for mainchain to stay decentralised as consumer Internet connections and hardware should increase accordingly (as long as the increase is relatively conservative enough).\n\n2. Encourage and drive centralised off-chain (eg. ChangeTip), decentralised off-chain (eg. Lightning Network), and other systems (eg. sidechains) that take the weight off the main chain. Aim to allow for an environment where the paranoid are able to run a node on consumer-grade hardware / Internet and have access to "raw" Bitcoin, whilst the general populace can use much faster off-chain / cross-chain services to buy their morning coffee.\n\nThat\'s off the top of my head, though, and needs some refinement.': 2, 'I\'m 80% certain it is, hence the "I\'m fine with 1 minute block times" comment he made the other day.': 1, "Again: he hasn't been around for ages, and in his absence there has been much improvement.

The process looks/behaves like the sidechain fraud-proof, with a timeout to show that a move was invalidated.   Like refunds in other complex contracts these unilateral closure transactions should never actually happen, and can pay large fees.  There is an attack there where someone begins the close then DOS attacks the blockchain to delay its fraud proof until after the timeout;  this attack can exist for any limit-- and having a larger straight-limit doesn't necessarily help if that size is being used for other transactions.\n\nThere are many ways to address this which haven't been adequately explored yet-- for example, the clock can stop when blocks are full; turning the security risk into more hold-up delay in the event of a dos attack. Then there is the point that it may not be necessary to timestamp the closures initially on the Bitcoin network, so the closure rush could potentially be accomplished via another mechanism, Lightning also seems particularly compatible with the dynamic size control schemes that cause block costs to go up significantly as blocks grow; since lightning 'fraud proof' closure transactions can pay large fees without concern (as the threat of them means they'll never need to be sent), especially because the extra capacity must not be in use if its to work to safely close the lightning channels.

Would you say that the coins are \xe2\x80\x9cstored\xe2\x80\x9d on the blockchain and that whomever controls the private key which corresponds to the public address (which derives from the public key) \xe2\x80\x9cowns\xe2\x80\x9d the BTC?\n\nThe owner of a coin is defined by the last entry in a chain of ownership. For example, Bob receives a coin from Alice, who receives it from Charles, a miner. Bob is the owner of the coin until he spends it. The chain of ownership is a sequence of backlinked transactions flowing like this:\n\n    Charles -> Alice -> Bob\n\n>The public key for this transaction must be the same key which she will now use to transmit 1 BTC to Bob. Is this correct?\n\nYes. To send the coin to Bob, Alice needs to create a transaction with an input. This input links to the output in the transaction that Charles used to give her the coin.\n\n> In terms of the private key, is this used directly or is the digital signature that derives from the private key used?\n\nAlice creates a digital signature from her private key and the transaction. (Technically, she also needs a random number to sign, but that\'s not critical here.)\n\n>But does she also use the private key to prove ownership of the 1 BTC that she has in her wallet? \n\nThe signature proves Alice is the intended recipient of the coin.\n\n>In other words: are both the digital signature and private key used (the first to authorise the transaction to Bob and the second to denote ownership of the 1 BTC previously sent to her)?\n\nNo. The transaction only carries Alice\'s signature, not the private key.\n\nThings are actually more complicated than this simple model. When a transaction is validated, a small, two-part program is run. The first part of the program comes from the transaction input, and it generally contains the public key and signature. The second part comes from the output that the input links to. It ensures that the correct steps are taken to validate the signature and public key.\n\nYou can play around with this programming language, confusingly named "Script", here:\n\nhttp://www.cs.princeton.edu/~tongbinw/bitcoinIDE/build/editor.html': 1, 'If you\'d like to understand this in excruciating detail, take a look at this blog entry:  \n\nhttp://www.righto.com/2014/02/bitcoins-hard-way-using-raw-bitcoin.html  \n\nAs far as your specific questions, I\'ll answer the ones I can:  \n\n> First, what defines \xe2\x80\x9cownership\xe2\x80\x9d of BTC? Would you say that the coins are \xe2\x80\x9cstored\xe2\x80\x9d on the blockchain and that whomever controls the private key which corresponds to the public address (which derives from the public key) \xe2\x80\x9cowns\xe2\x80\x9d the BTC? Or would you phrase this differently?  \n\nYou have the right idea, but I\'d phrase it that the person that holds the private key controls the coins at the associated address. Specifically, a signature from the private key is required to spend any unspent transaction outputs (utxo\'s) that were sent to the associated address.  \n\n> In terms of the private key, is this used directly or is the digital signature that derives from the private key used?  \n\nOnly a signature is required. In fact, that\'s how hardware Bitcoin wallets like Trezor and Ledger keep their balances secure or "cold", by making sure the private keys themselves are never exposed to the Internet.  \n\n> But does she also use the private key to prove ownership of the 1 BTC that she has in her wallet?  \n\nShe does not, because anyone that knows an address can check the balance of utxo\'s on the block chain. The private key is only ever needed to generate new signatures (or to re-generate the public key and/or address if required).': 2, 'Thank you for your helpful replies. I think that I understand now.\n\nMy confusion was that I imagined the blockchain process as working in two ways. The first was "ownership" of a public address on the blockchain (through control of the private key). The second was that of the transaction process which transfers ownership of coins from Alice to Bob. Since the reason to control an address is the ability to transact the coins, it is more helpful for me to understand this as one situation rather than as two. And it is the signature (which derives from the private key) which is required to transact.\n\nThe other issue I did not realise was the need to resolve the difference between the public key and the public address. I knew that the two were not the same, but I didn\'t realise that the public key of Alice needed to be transmitted since the address where she received coins was, in itself, insufficient to complete the transaction to Bob. \n\nPlease let me know if this makes sense!': 1}, ('for django-bitcoin-instawallet, where is my wallet file located? thanks', 0): {'https://github.com/kangasbros/django-bitcoin-instawallet/blob/master/settings.py#L151': 1, 'thank you.\nwhere can I find "BITCOIND_CONNECTION_STRING = "http://login:password@localhost:8332""': 1, 'thank you so much.\nCan you tell me where the "django.db" located?\n': 1, 'BITCOIND_CONNECTION_STRING = "http://login:password@localhost:8332"\n\nits talking to bitcoind, so wherever your bitcoind stores the wallet file.': 1, 'BTW, I uses this https://github.com/perldev/stock_trade/tree/18346af34a3b63701894cafe5d8ae8f1ad7d5b50': 1}, ('A few tips to increase the anonymity of your BTC transactions', 0): {'Bravo': 1, 'Jesus, this article reads like it was written by a 3-year-old.

When receiving from an unknown party, though, you should be aware that double-spends are apparently doable (thought I personally haven't figured out how) particularly if fee-gaming is used. In this ploy, the crook sends you an apparently good transaction that is either zero fee, severely under fee, or has very immature coins. One or all of these factors will delay the transaction getting picked up by miners. Meanwhile, unbeknownst to you, the crook has simultaneously double-spent the same coins but with a much larger fee to an address of his/her own. The trick here is being able to submit the second transaction with the proper fee to enough miners' mempools so that there is a good chance the second transaction gets confirmed first, *and at the same time* making sure the first transaction gets in the minimum number of the right nodes' mempools so that the merchant service provider thinks the transaction is OK. The details of how to accomplish this reliably is what I've never figured out yet, myself. When I've played around with it, the second transaction is generally rejected from the network because the first transaction propagates very quickly.  \n\nPeter Todd made [a post some time ago](http://redd.it/239bj1) claiming the process was simple, repeatable, and succeeded in a high percentage of attempts, though if I recall correctly he glossed over both the fee-gaming *and* any explanation of how to submit the second transaction to the network (perhaps with good reason, not wanting to enable the attack for thieves). There's also the corresponding [BitcoinTalk thread](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=574774.0).\n\nThere are, of course, ways to protect yourself and still accept zero confirmation transactions with reasonable confidence. The first is to evaluate the transaction the customer sends before delivering goods. Make sure there are no issues that will delay confirmation. This alone almost closes the door on the fee-gaming attack. You can also use a system like Mycelium Android wallet's Buy / Sell [Transaction Confidence](https://mycelium.com/lt/help.html) meter to see how well the correct transaction is propagating over the network. Finally, you should monitor Blockchain.info (and perhaps other block explorers that have the same feature) for double-spends of the inputs of the original transaction.

Low stratum classes are completely oblivious about bitcoin, generally speaking, and middle class is slowly getting to know it. Businesses have 0 confidence in bitcoin because its usage would risk its ban as it already happened on Ecuador.\n\n**Perception**: Bitcoin ~~ Gold, at least here. Trading bitcoin is almost as trading a high valued and secure commodity, when you compare it with trading USD (highly illegal) or holding VEF (with almost 3 digit YoY inflation, plain stupid).\n\n**BTC accesibility**: 1 BTC == 1 year of minimum wage. Very costly to get them, at least in monetary terms, but the trading "scene" is thriving. We have one established exchange which is nice and realiable, localbitcoins trades are commonplace, and there\'s one facebook group full of trading and selling with bitcoin.\n\nRegarding your perception of bitcoin as a sinking ship, that\'s only a first world problem. Here on Venezuela bitcoin seems like the go-to to store one\'s wealth, as crazy as it sounds, because VEF\'s value is diminishing fast.\n\nTL;DR: Although it is currently a tech that only the 1% of the 1% knows, it is rapidly gaining traction here on Venezuela.': 27, "Stop trolling your 20MB block size everywhere.

Once my dad and i bought a "Professional" license for Delphi 5 (you can begin deducing i\'m no kiddo now ;) so we could develop legally our software, btw, the one that keeps my family well fed. However, since the Chavez administration instaurated the foreign exchange control, things have been downhill since that moment. First, we started with an anual quota of 3000 USD/year, which was reduced some years ago to 400 USD/year, and last year reduced to 300 USD/year on credit card expenditures. Now, picture yourself with only $300 a year on the internet and you can begin to understand why on my country piracy, counterfeits and rejected/fleeing foreign businesses are so flagrant. To add insult over injury, the electronic quota can only be spent with credit cards, with an APR of 27%, and only given to a select few (less than 10% of the population has access to credit cards).\n\nThis year, the Maduro administration was so dumb as to add further restrictions: only credit cards from state owned banks can be used to spend foreign currency (these banks account for less than 10% of the current credit card holders, myself NOT included) and they tried (but failed, fortunately) to restrict the 300 USD/year to 100 USD/4months.\n\nThese policies have put a HUGE pressure on the black market, which started year 2014 at around 70 VEF/USD and later skyrocketed to ~400 VEF/USD. However, this isn\'t the whole story: The current (and only) black market indicator is the one owned by DolarToday, which has been target of several state run attacks, and has been blocked countless times by the main internet domain name solver (that is, coincidentally, state run); being the sole market indicator is a huge problem, because no one wants to publish this kind of information (you could get between 6 to 10 years of hard time), and DolarToday only uses the exchange information from the Cucuta/Venezuela country border, which is heavily distorted by a) Colombian people fleeing the country because the state xenophobia for their kind; b) obvious whales are obvious; c) state run cartels.\n\nThere\'s a sore need for a better market indicator, but no-one is going to risk their necks with that.\n\n**How can YOU help?**\n\nVote with your wallet, use services that accept bitcoin/litecoin/any other crypto first and foremost. If you have the option to pay with USD or BTC, use the latter. Never, ever let the bright flame of innovation wane out of existence due to lazyness.
