The part for "address fixing is really simple though.  A bitcoin address is just a base58 encoding of the hex "version byte + ripemd160(sha256(pubkey)) + checksum" where version byte is 0x00 for bitcoin mainnet, and checksum is the most significant 4 bytes of sha256(sha256()) of the previous bytes.\n\nSo let\'s say I have a public key of:\n\n    03df22c00ff21b1b49e49c2d0b7bd9f10a18339218c40b140925c41d15f51b3b26\n\nthe sha256 hash of that is:\n\n    2e5d805687e51101af9c88d40d09b7143b90d131e085768392af837e8a75e9ae\n\nand the ripemd160 hash of that is:\n\n    4d569f7ad43016c4ff234fb25f4b6baf41f03130\n\nSo that\'s the "hash160" which is what bitcoin devs call ripemd160(sha256()).  So since we\'re using bitcoin, we put 00 as the version byte in front:\n\n    004d569f7ad43016c4ff234fb25f4b6baf41f03130\n\nand then sha256 it and sha256 it again and get:\n\n    46694e7e27f4ecdf631ef6d7279370bf70d121490589316870600354edcab1fd\n\nthe first four bytes of which are 46694e7e, so we append that at the end and get a final hex string of\n\n    004d569f7ad43016c4ff234fb25f4b6baf41f0313046694e7e\n\nwhich we convert to base58 to get the string:\n\n    183voSY5CKc4NMacRsaMJNSdC81n9LA5Ed\n\nwhich is the corresponding bitcoin address.\n\nThe term "base58 check-encode" is short hand for taking some hex and finding that double-sha256 checksum and then adding the first 4 bytes to the end and base58 encoding the entire thing including the checksum.  Bitcoin and most alts always just include the checksum part when creating any base58 string, because that allows the software to easily tell if it\'s been mis-typed.\n\nSo what you do to fix the checksum is just decode the base58 string back into hex, ignore and delete the checksum part completely, and then re-encode the non-checksum part with the correct checksum, and so you "fix" the checksum.\n\nNote that this will only work if the base58 string is the correct length.  Even one char more/less changes the ENTIRE hex output, since you\'re not just lopping off a part of the hex when you lop off the base58 char, you\'re actually reducing the base58 string as a number by a power of 58, which means the hex is entirely different.\n\nSo the base58 string:\n\n    183voSY5CKc4NMacRsaMJNSdC81n9LA5E\n\nwhich is the bitcoin address without the last character, decodes to the hex:\n\n    0001555b0688127bfa91a3eb4e1c20326889f6e65d85a0b651\n\nwhich is the correct number of hex bytes for a bitcoin address, just with an incorrect checksum.  So if I tried to "fix" that address, I\'d get:\n\n    183voSY5CKc4NMacRsaMJNSdC81j6tW3w\n\nwhich is in fact a valid bitcoin address, but it\'s NOT the correct address.  That\'s the address for the hash160:\n\n    01555b0688127bfa91a3eb4e1c20326889f6e65d\n\ninstead of the hash160\n\n    4d569f7ad43016c4ff234fb25f4b6baf41f03130\n\nSo any time you correct an address, you need to try to make sure you are using the correct number of characters in your base58 address, which is why my tool, in order to "fix" a mis-typed address, first tries to correct single and double char mis-types and then -- as a last resort -- assumes the beginning part is correct and simply updates the checksum to match.\n\nAs for how it does that, well it just iterates through every possible combination of addresses that are the same as the input except for 1 char changed, and then it decodes them and sees if the checksum is valid, and if not, moves on.  To fix two chars, it does the same thing, but with a recursion function to do a second character check for every instance of the first character change.  I stop at two chars, because more than that both takes forever, since you\'re exponentially increasing the number of decode/checks you have to do with each extra char, and also because the checkum is only 3-5 letters, and so the chance of an incorrect address being found due to a collision in the 4-byte checksum is great increased.\n\nI plan to also add in the future another check to change the upper/lower case of each char, since that may be a common mistake of input and isn\'t that big of an extra search space.  I\'ll also try to think of other things that people may do to mess up an address which are easier to find, and which unlike 3+ char complete typos won\'t result in a substantial chance of incorrect checksum collisions.\n\nThat\'s kind of all you can do.  At some point, a mis-typed address simply isn\'t salvageable, since the checksum is only 4 bytes, so anything even approaching that level of mistake is simply so large of a search space that collisions are bound to happen and it\'s not possible to tell which collision is the "correct" one since they\'re all valid addresses.': 1, 'I am not sure if I understand your address checksum corrector correctly - let me confirm:\n\nLet\'s take one concrete example: If you pass the "incorrect address"\n\n1sendToThisAddressToBurnBTChJ4Si7M\n\n(it has probably an incorrect checksum)\n\nto your tool, what will the tool\'s output be?

Nothing!\n\nAnd what will happen if the blockchain shows a spending from the first address?

Nevertheless, everybody who fills a lottery ticket with the second sequence is naive. Because if he wins, he won't win but a few dollars maximum.": 1, 'Then you should not use bitcoin at all.

You\'d want to fill up the space before the checksum entirely to prove your point.  That\'s why the counteryparty burn address is \n\n    1CounterpartyXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXUWLpVr\n\nBase58 is just a math conversion to another format.  Just as 10 in base2 is 2 in base10.\n\nIn practice, this just means that as long as your base58 string is the right number of characters, 33 or 34, you can "decode" the base58 string into hex, and if the non-checksum part is correct, you can easily re-compute the correct checksum.\n\nThat\'s what my tool does.  It assumes the non-checksum part is right and fixes the checksum, by decoding the base58 into 25 hex bytes and ignoring the checksum, and then re-encoding the hex with the right checksum.  Eventually I\'m going to add to it the ability to iterate through changing one or two characters and seeing if that fixes the entire address, including with the same input checksum, before doing the check-sum fix, since it\'s more likely that an address was simply mis-typed if there\'s an error.  That way, the utility will "fix" a mis-typed address, rather than being just an app to recompute a checksum.': 1, 'For survey: Upvote THIS post (not the original post) if you would also be interested in such a tool (for whatever reason).': 0, 'That sounds great.

It would merely freeze the network because blocks could be found instantly.  A bitcoin address is a ripemd160 hash of a sha256 hash of a public key, which is a point in a secp256k1 elliptic curve.\n\nBreaking sha256 doesn\'t enable you to fake secp256k1 curve signatures.  So it\'s not useful in cracking addresses.  All it does is make finding blocks instant, which as said, would freeze the network and cause a hard fork.\n\nAnd in the absolute worst case scenario where somehow that did cause bitcoins to get stolen, the fork would simply begin at a checkpoint in the past.  Other alts have done that already, and bitcoin did it in 2010 when a very huge fatal flaw was found that allowed anybody to spend anybody else\'s coins, and nobody had realized it until then.\n\nBitcoin in its current form is very likely to be secure.  It would take multiple compromises all at once for the integrity of system to be completely shot.  Rest easy.

You can\'t prove a negative.\n\nThe way you "prove" you don\'t own an address is to use very clear human-recognizable patterns that are more likely to be chosen by a person than as a random output.

All I can do is continue to *fail* to prove that I **do** own one or the other.  Given that addresses are hashes of keys, and thus can\'t be reversed, and given that public keys can\'t be reversed into private keys, it seems unlikely that I was able to go from a private key to a public key to a hash160 that forms a base58 address with such a human-recognizable pattern as the first address... but it IS possible.\n\nThe reality is that I own the private key for neither.  The second address was made by changing one character of the hash160 of the first address.\n\nBut I can\'t prove that I don\'t own the private keys.  All I can do is not provide them and profess that I am being truthful.': 2, 'So, an address checksum calculator?': 0, 'Sure: But if someone proves existence of a priv key for an address starting with\n\n 1abcdefghijkLmnopqrst...\n\nthen you will hopefully (if you understand hash functions) try to sell your bitcoins asap before price drops to zero, because everybody correctly assumes that Bitcoin has been broken.

Ironically, this article\'s author is still thinking very small.\n\nThis is the shallow story of bitcoin as payment network first, and money second.  It is told in iterations over and over by the media and by the new bitcoiners who do not understand what bitcoin is, and do not understand what it\'s primary impact will necessarily be.  Sadly the author only sees two sides of a vapid  culture of newcomers to bitcoin, and comes up with an outlook which is not only just marginally more insightful than the current debates over apple as competitor; but pretends that this perspective hasn\'t been discussed and mulled over already for ages in the bitcoin community.\n\nA lot of bitcoiners are going to keep being surprised by how poorly bitcoin performs, in competition with other up-and-coming payment rails, according to their limited understanding of what they think it\'s nature is.\n\nBitcoin is and always was a potentially new unit of money; which necessarily flowed through it\'s own payment network; and the marginal advances in utility that that network itself, and blockchain technology in general provided, created the initial valuation of the commodity unit, in order to bootstrap an exchange price.\n\nA bitcoin unit either achieves full status as a money (i.e. including unit of account, rather than just a payment token and proxy for fiat prices), or this experiment will eventually fail.  Not only is the speculation and volatility expected by those of us who have understood from the beginning what bitcoin\'s real value proposition is, but it is absolutely necessary.  Free flowing and organic valuation of the unit must occur, and price discovery must happen; until a large enough and wide enough pool of demand exists.  Spending coins is fine and an inevitable part of the growing ecosystem, but is not what is necessary to develop monetary status.  It must become widely held, and valued in it\'s own right; it must be very liquid.  Merchants and vendors and individuals must eventually start to accept bitcoin. . . not because they want to get dollars over a slightly cheaper payment network; but because they value and demand the token itself; and that value becomes reflected in a stabilizing purchasing power for goods which purchasing power de-couples from the fiat exchange prices.\n\nBitcoin is necessarily about leaving governments, and their banking arms, out of the equation.  It is really not so much about sticking it to credit card companies, or to the legitimate functions of banking. . . It is emminently anti-state.  Control of money is the primary leg which the state stands on to exert control.  Undermining that is bitcoin\'s primary value proposition.  An alternative and escape hatch to the controlled, taxed, inflated, and Orwellian fiat money systems, which are holding the economy and human rights back, and which is destined to fail and create catastrophic societal upheaval.  It is a vote against centralized powers, and tyranny, and the ability to externalize the costs of war and other non-desirable services, in an obfuscated way onto a confused population.\n\nIt is quite literally, an alternative system of governance (a limited scope of governance, but an important one) a repository of societal will, which is currently collecting value and confidence transferred from the centralized and broken nation-state systems.  And it doesn\'t need all of society to invest in it, or believe in it, or to share this outlook, in order to reach a certain critical mass.  It doesn\'t necessarily need "mainstream" adoption; though I hope that all will be wise enough to join and reap the benefits.\n\nBitcoin is political in this way; and if you can\'t get over your blood-lust and control issues which perpetuate the irrational belief in the necessity of coercive monopoly government to dominate society. . . well, let me save you some time and trouble:  bitcoin is not going to take society places you want it to go.  If you disagree, feel free to use it though, and continue to value it for whatever somewhat-inane benefits you think it provides that are palatable to a mainstream audience.  You vote against your violent systems just by doing so.  \n\nVery few will see it this way, and very few are ready to ideologically commit to a doctrine based on this reality. . . but it is foolish to believe that in practicality, people are not divesting themselves from centralized control; sometimes in ways they don\'t realize.  It is foolish to believe that people are afraid of black and grey markets, and so if bitcoin\'s moneyness is relegated to those spheres, that that would crush it.  People are increasingly becoming involved in black and grey markets; out of self-interest, out of necessity.  Even those who consider themselves law-abiding citizens are understanding that they have an obligation to go around tyrannical laws and controls; and in order to protect themselves and make a living.  People are understanding at least that nearly everything is illegal now, and that it is impossible to be "law abiding" and that their government\'s now have complete discretionary and defacto control over their lives because of this.  People are not as fat and happy and placated as many would like us to believe.  They are becoming enlightened enough to not want war and violence. . . .but agitated enough to see and take advantage of agoristic and peaceful ways to skirt the state and make them unnecessary and obsolete.  \n\nThis trend will only strengthen, I assure you.  Don\'t be caught on the wrong side of history, still clinging to the violent ways of the past, while most of the rest of the world has made a cultural shift to what you foolishly believe is impossible or necessitates a change of human nature.\n\nDown with tyrants.

He saw PayPal facilitating trade in currency for anyone with an Internet connection by enabling an instant transfer of funds from insecure currencies to more stable ones, such as U.S. dollars. Thiel explained to his young staff how governments had historically robbed their own citizens through inflation and currency devaluation. The very rich could always protect themselves by investing offshore. It\'s the poor and middle class, Thiel explained, who get screwed. "PayPal will give citizens worldwide more direct control over their currencies than they ever had before," Thiel predicted. "It will be nearly impossible for corrupt governments to steal wealth from their people through their old means because if they try the people will switch to dollars or pounds or yen, in effect dumping the worthless local currency for something more secure."\n\nSo I\'d look forward to more analysis from him.

Facebook / Twitter / LinkedIn / Email\n2. Mobile Phone \n3. ID Scan/Facial Recognition\n\nI realise this has already been done on several sites, but let's take it a step further and see how bitcoin fits in:\n\nWith each authentication tier, the wallet associated with your account gains more trust within the network and your vote / karma is positively weighted accordingly.  \n\nWhat's more, if a particular ID is seen to be abusing the system, their vote / karma weights can be set to zero and/or the user associated with the ID banned from the given network/service;  this part is crucial, spamming and vote rigging becomes a one-time only deal if you are risking your own identity on not getting caught.\n\nVarious tweaks can be put in place at each tier level to further influence the weightings: Age of facebook account, number of twitter followers, wallet analysis etc. \n\nWith regard to 3. AirBnB use Jumio to achieve ID validation and it's pretty damn cool - Hold your passport or licence up in front of your webcam and it's instantly authenticated.  Jumio also have a product called [Bitcoin Identity Open Network](https://www.jumio.com/bison/) (which I've only just discovered). \n\nAnonymity can still be preserved within the system; personal details such as social media profiles, ID scan results can simply be stored as scrambled hashes; their purpose only to ensure no duplicate identities can be associated with any given bitcoin address, meaning a user never has to actually associate that information with any site or service.\n\nTrust levels could be stored on the Blockchain, rather than a centralised service, with a simple one-off spend on the associated account that stores their tier level after verification is complete.  Karma levels associated with various sites on the network could also be stored and updated on the blockchain, albeit more infrequently.  Alternatively, these kind of identity association requests could, ultimately, be hardcoded into the protocol or handled by an online wallet provider such as blockchain.info as an extra service offering on top of their standard web wallet.  \n\nWe are left with one multi-use, transportable and unforgeable identity, locked to a bitcoin address that can be used for logging into various services (electoral voting, social network presence and all kinds of cool stuff that is currently impossible) whilst still preserving a persons anonymity.  And, perhaps crucially, an identity that the average layman can get to grips with for as long as they have an ID/mobile phone and/or online presence (basically, if they can use AirBnB to build trust, so too can they use this system).  \n\nOnly issues I can foresee:\n\n*Trusting a third party like Jumio to ratify all of that information:* I see no reason why any 3rd party would need to know which bitcoin address is requesting ID validation (except as a scrambled hash that can be passed back to whatever open source service handles the callbacks).  \n\n*Misuse/Hijacking of addresses:*  This could be solved with a 'cooling off' period whereby user weightings are frozen at zero for a set period of time if a particular service deems the address blacklisted.  Subsequent hijacks elicit longer periods.  Details of bans available on a trusted web service similar to ebay rankings that give banned users of a given service the right to protest / rebuttal.  Ultimately though, how blacklisted accounts are handled are completely up to the service provider (It doesn't matter if you've been a naughty boy on Reddit - you still get to participate in Electoral votes for instance).\n\n*Service bias:* Sites and services themselves (such as Reddit, Youtube, Disqus, AirBnB) would be linked and ranked by the crowd in a similar way to users so that any specific services misusing the system (say blanket banning users) can be weeded out.\n": 1, 'Ok then please enlighten me.

For example, if a podcast or online show was looking for a way to monetize their content without ads, they could have their listeners vote on who the next guest on the show should be. A Bitcoin address is attached to each possible guest, and the address with the largest number of bitcoins in it at the end of voting is the next guest on the show.  \n  \n2) Your part on Frozencoin and recommendation systems is something I've thought about rather extensively. A decentralized Reddit is one of the first apps that I would like to see built on top of Bitcloud, but dealing with Sybil attacks is rather difficult, even with your suggestions. Due to the fact that the frontpage of Reddit is prime real estate, it could turn into nothing but advertisements from companies who are upvoting their content. At the end of the day, you always still need some form of moderation from actual humans. One possible solution is to have moderators delete content that is obviously just an advertisement (much like normal subreddit moderators).  \n  \nAs a side note, the use of moderation from actual humans is one of the key differences between Bitcloud and some of the other projects in the decentralized Internet space.": 8, "1. Yes.\n2. You can solve this problem using a more sophisticated collaborative filtering stuff on top of the basic system: Client software will record user's upvotes/downvotes and will use them to train a filter to ignore unwanted content. E.g. we will associate a weight with each user's identity (an unique FrozenCoin). Initially these weights are zero, i.e. we do not count upvotes. Each time user upvotes a link which was upvoted by user X, user X's weight is incremented. Eventually, we will only count upvotes from like-minded users.": 2, "Yep, it only works in a combination with an oracle which makes sure that a private key is destroyed.\n\nE.g. user creates a transaction which sends coins to 2-of-2 multisig where one key belongs to an oracle, oracle creates and signs nLockTime'd refund transactions and immediately destroys its private key, user will publish his transaction after he receives a refund transaction.": 2, 'Please *let it go* already. ^:)': 1, 'While something like this may be a viable way to stop Sybil attacks in internet popularity contests you are fooling yourself if you think that anyone will accept the idea that rich people can get thousands or millions of votes compared to a poor person if they just lock some funds for some time.  And the very poor may not be able to afford any vote at all.  One vote per person is how it must work.\n\nIf we imagine one colored satoshi-coin issued per birth, the blockchain becomes a great tool for subsequent identity verification for valueless or low-value operations like electronic submission of income taxes, or opinion polling (but issuing these in a trustless fashion is an unsolved problem).  Blockchain ID can increase identification efficiency at the voting booth.  However, there is tremendous strength in the human proof-of-work required to physically enter a ballot station, in the people checking ID and looking for repeat voters, and in the conspiracy laws that could be invoked if a rich person paid 100 people to drive around town doing this.\n': 1, "It isn't another coin, I simply gave a name to concept of 'freezing' a Bitcoin using nLockTime.

Coin-days are already used for Sybil attack prevention of sorts in several applications, notable Bitcoin free transactions throttling and Peercoin proof-of-stake (the initial protocol version was 100% based on coin-days, later version use it in a more limited form).\n\nThese approaches are so similar that differences between them are fairly subtle.\n\n> The frozen coin has an expiry.\n\nThat doesn't need to be the case: we can define that if input of one frozen coin was the output of another frozen coin, it is considered the same frozen coin identity. (I.e. a frozen coin was renewed). Thus there is an option to keep using same identity.\n\nI'd say one of clear advantages frozen coins have is that when you have a new application which uses frozen coins and it gets very popular, new users won't have to wait for a long time before they can start using it.\n\nAlthough it is just a pragmatic advantage rather than economic consideration, as it doesn't apply to a situation where system is already established, and everybody who wants frozen/delay coins already have them.\n\nAnother difference is that when you do not require coins to be marked in a particular way, people might offer signatures associated with old coins which just happen to sit in their wallets for tiny bribes, as it doesn't cost them anything (if we assume that ECDSA isn't broken and computational costs are negligible). Thus people can farm their own coins.\n\nThey can also [farm frozen coins](http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/2g5qqq/frozencoin_a_concept/ckg3ldc), but economics is a bit different. \n\nAll in all, I'd say it warrants further research.": 6, 'It seems like a big problem that the FrozenCoin concept requires a trusted third-party even if it can be a group.

But processing payments was really problematic in pre-Bitcoin time, so I focused on collaborative filtering aspects of it, and, basically, got lost in it.\n\nOne problem with it is that mechanics of investing into content is rather tricky. If it is bitcoin-based, it needs to be a zero-sum game, you need both winners and losers. Many different approaches are possible, I think generally they fall into following categories:\n\n1. Ponzi-like: Each post (entity which can be upvoted) is independent, people who invest early would earn some money, people who are late will lose it. Fairly easy to implement in a decentralized system. Can be combined with a raffle. People will be reluctant to invest when they are late.\n2. Parimutuel: All invested money is collected into one pool (e.g. on a daily basis) and the best entries win. Which entries are the best? If you define that entries which have the most money wagered on them are the best, you have a problem that wealthiest people are going to win, and it has nothing to do with quality. Perhaps you can solve this by having two different groups of people: one will invest into posts, another will vote for them. (E.g. using FrozenCoins as Sybil-prevention.) But it still can be prone to abuse.\n3. Prediction market: Roughly the same as parimutuel.\n4. External revenue: People invest by buying shares (like they do on the stock market), hosting platform displays ads, revenue from ads goes to shareholders. I\'d say it is the most straightforward approach, but is also a bit boring.\n5. Reward points: Instead of earning bitcoins, people get some kind of \'reward points\'. Then it is no longer a zero-sum game, but I\'m not sure how it can work.\n\n> I think the moderators would still be needed for this proposal to work.\n\nWhat\'s the role of moderators? If they control who gets rewarded, they might collude with people to whom rewards go.\n\nIf their role is simply to remove ads, I\'d say it would be better to incorporate ads into the same system. If it is zero-sum game, ads will end up being losers (as people will downvote them) and money will go to quality content. Thus ad campaign money will go to content producers, which is good, no?\n\nAnyway, I now have a different idea, which, I believe, can solve problems which arise when you "replace karma with bitcoin tips".  It is a new kind of money which works differently from Bitcoin and might be more suitable for karma-like things. Actually I was going to introduce it in one article with FrozenCoin (FrozenCoin can be a part of it), but decide to split it into two.': 1, 'Use nLockTime --> make FrozenCoin. FrozenCoin scarce and pricy like bitcoin.  U know proof of burn? Ok, now think *temporary* proof of burn. ': 3, "This is interesting. The eventual goal with the decentralized Reddit idea was basically to replace karma with bitcoin tips. This means people could post their content directly to the Reddit and the karma they received would also be bitcoin tips. Then there's the problem of people not wanting to pay for upvoting content, but they could also be allowed to invest in the content. This means they would actually receive a reward of bitcoins if the content they originally upvoted turned out to be a successful post. I think the moderators would still be needed for this proposal to work.": 1, 'Something similar can be achieved by looking to the past instead of the future. Any address that has had a minimum amount of bitcoin for a minimum amount of time is considered "staked". Then you don\'t have to mess with nLockTime or escrow.\n\nTo take the twitter example: Any address that has had at least 1 BTC continuously for at least the last two weeks can post one message per day.\n\nPoll example: An address must hold at least 0.1 BTC from the time voting begins until it ends for the vote to be counted.': 3, 'Not for proof of burn but maybe something else.

If I pay 0.1% annual interest for freezing coins, people will consider this, as long as it's constructed with no risk to them. If I pay my interest upfront and the coin owner signs those messages for me, it's a 100% safe investment.\n\nSo instead of a $1 proof of burn, your temporary proof of freeze costs me only $0.001 on the dollar.
