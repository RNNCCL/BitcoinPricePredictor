There were some pictures earlier of a fire that destroyed three computers in the same house.\n\n> M of N key splitting for the backups which need no password.\n\nThe M of N thing is neat, but bip38 is effectively a 2 of 2 because you need both the password and the key to access them so to me it's overkill to go beyond 2 of 2. It might be useful if you have a situation where you have multiple people that can use the wallet (like an organization), but multisig is better than the shamir's secret implementation that armory does, but I haven't seen a good implementation for offline signing of multi-sig transactions yet. For just storing personal bitcoins, I think 2 of 2 (as implemented with bip38) is fine. You just need to print out three copies of the password and three copies of the wallet and store them in different places. Then losing 2 of 3 of the password and 2 of 3 of the wallet are safe and as long as no one person (other than yourself) has access to the key and the password, you're safe. Also, last time I was looking at Armory the shamir's secret (M of N) implementation said it's still beta and didn't reccommend using it for large amounts of bitcoins yet which is why I didn't use it (it's possible it's ready now, but that made me a little nervous at the time I made my paper wallets). Armory also doesn't use the standard bip38 so you can only use Amory to deal with your bitcoins which is a big deal. bip38 is widely supported by many wallets. The signing of offline transactions is nice, but you can import a key to armory to do offline transactions (which I was looking into doing next time I need to move from one paper wallet to another, but it's kind of a pain to setup in the offline/online mode so I just held off on that).": 1, "We flew right by the moon and didn't even slow down.": 2, 'Many bitcoin companies pay employees salaries in bitcoin too.

Some invested millions in hardware and won't stop cus the price drops 30$. Another reddit user showed us yesterday that they need to sell 40% of all coins to pay the bills. That means that it's still highly profitable for them to mine(hardware aside), and the price can even go alot lower. There is no direct correlation between hashrate and price. Not direct anyways ;-) \n\nHope it helps? \n\n\nEdit: Some typos ": 2, 'I just switched  off my two Antminer S2. I pay $0.15 for power and outside temp is zero degree celsius.
