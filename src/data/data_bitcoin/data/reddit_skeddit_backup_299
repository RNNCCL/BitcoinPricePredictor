Firstly, the fees that people pay are totally unrelated to the security that they receive, so people have no incentive to pay more than is necessary for their desired confirmation time. Secondly, if there are even just a few stupid or generous miners who accept transactions at a loss, then miners as a group lose their ability to enforce reasonable pricing. If 1% of miners accept transactions with essentially no fee and 99% of miners only accept transactions that are high enough to pay for their current costs plus a little profit, then at least some users will send transactions at the lower fee level to save money. But since adding just one more transaction is nearly free, the latter group of miners will constantly want to accept these cheaper transactions as well to make a little more money, and I'd expect the percentage of low-fee miners to gradually increase. So I'd expect the actual transaction fee to move toward the cost of adding a transaction to a block, which is almost nothing, and certainly not enough to support sufficient network security.\n\nOne way of solving this is by artificially restricting the size of blocks. With very large blocks, miners need to think about rejecting transactions purely to convince people to pay more, and this probably won't end up creating profitable prices. If miners can only include so many transactions, then this creates actual competitive demand for block space. With small blocks, miners just include the highest-fee transactions, and the fee varies only according to the demand at the time. There's no guarantee that the price arrived at through competition for block space will be in any way *correct*, as it is entirely unrelated to the amount of network security that Bitcoin users need or desire. But it makes it likely that at least some miners (the most efficient ones) will make a profit, which is probably not the case with large blocks. Therefore, a really conservative strategy for managing the max block size would be to keep the max block size small until we're sure that fees are high enough to support sufficient network security, and only then carefully increase the max block size. There are other proposals like /u/nullc's flex cap idea which try to maintain the artificial scarcity in a more free-market way, though there are AFAICT always constants which somehow influence various costs -- a form of unfortunate (though in the end perhaps necessary and survivable) central economic planning.\n\nRather than artificially introducing scarcity in block space, I think that it would probably be sufficient to forego transaction fees except as an anti-spam measure and just rely on assurance contracts. Once a company feels that the network's mining power is too low for comfort, it'd start an assurance contract to collect some money to incentivize mining over a time period. The first company might start out the fund with 10 BTC, and set up the assurance contract such that 500 BTC must be collected for all of the payments to unlock and miners to be paid. (Some protocol extensions or something might be necessary for the payment to get spread out over a time period.) It is a common goods problem, but I don't think that Bitcoin users (especially businesses) will allow things to degrade to insecure levels when they can improve the situation by donating a very small amount in an assurance contract every now and then. Wallet software might even suggest donation amounts periodically, perhaps calculated according to the wallet's recent transaction volume and the network's current difficulty. People are mostly not rational+selfish economic actors (look at kickstarter and patreon), and I think that just *asking* for donations from a ton of people may well be sufficient.\n\nModern-day network difficulty is way higher than it needs to be. Certainly the network doesn't require 25 BTC every block for security, and fees+donations don't need to gather that much.\n\nI'm not sure that assurance contracts will work. Despite being an anarcho-capitalist and free-marketeer, I am not *utterly opposed* to artificially restricting block space *if necessary*. But I'd like to try all other possible options (including new research) before resorting to the not-free-market artificial scarcity method.\n\nDecentralization is another matter. Some sort of max block size (maybe not necessarily a *global* max block size) is necessary to prevent miners from preventing people from running full nodes by creating too-large blocks. (If the economy is not mostly backed by full nodes, Bitcoin is terribly insecure.) Maybe the required max block size for decentralization will be lower than the max block size required for sufficient fees (in which case there is no problem with fees), or maybe it'll be much higher -- I don't know.": 3, ">Bitcoin was designed to route itself around authority. \n\nToo bad /r/bitcoin wasn't.": 43, 'If "opinions of one man are not especially important anyway" why is one man making the rules in this subreddit?': 2, "Satishi was authoritarian.

Where does he get this from? This sort of decision making process means that it is much easier for a malicious actor to halt any further development. It eliminates the possibility of Bitcoin being anti-fragile, for which the ability to change is crucial. It means that they only need one of the group to become obstructionist, come up with all sorts of theoretical problems to any important new change and use them to justify blocking it, ensuring that development comes to a standstill. The best defence against malicious special interest capture is not a unanimity requirement, which actually makes it more vulnerable, it's to decentralize development by having multiple competing implementations. You can then sigh a relief about being responsible for trillions of other people's dollars. Miners are responsible for the code that they run, and it is more healthy if they have multiple compatible options to choose from. Acting like developers are responsible for the entire ecosystem is unhealthy in itself.": 5, 'There\'s a transcript here:\n\nhttp://diyhpl.us/wiki/transcripts/2015-09-07-epicenter-bitcoin-adam3us-scalability/\n\nI believe this dialogue sort of sums up the problem in the Bitcoin Core project. Brian asks, I think, six times, how decisions can be reached when there isn\'t total agreement. I counted ~~six~~ seven times. And he asked so many times because he never really got an answer.\n\nIt\'s obvious that things would be a lot easier if everyone always agreed. Everyone knows that. It\'d be great. We actually never had that though, ever. There was always dissent. Satoshi and Gavin kept a lid on it for a while, and now Wladimir isn\'t doing that anymore we have these problems. I am really not the first person to propose having someone who decides for a specific software project. It\'s actually just the way things have always been in every software project.\n\nAdam says that to have a single decider would result in huge pressure, maybe blackmail, etc. I think he overestimates how interesting the obscure details of ordering transactions in time is. We actually did have a single decider for most of Bitcoin\'s history and I don\'t recall these things ever being a problem. Because, you know, that\'s what the purpose of being able to fork is. Ensuring that nobody is actually worth blackmailing or pressuring because they can always just walk away, or do something stupid and then nobody uses their software any more.\n\nAdditionally the same arguments could be made for lots of things, like the Linux kernel. It has direct access to lots of important private keys. What stops Linus being blackmailed? Well, his work is still peer reviewed of course, and people can fork. That\'s what stops it.\n\nThat is what\'s so dangerous about all this anti-software-forking rhetoric. People mean well, but they don\'t seem able to see that they\'re breaking the most important safety valve Bitcoin has. Because of all the rhetoric people have been getting it in their heads that anything other than Core is dangerous, morally wrong, not Bitcoin, a "coup", an "attack on the network" to give Gregory\'s view. And then, of course, that really does make Wladimir a potential target of pressure, because people will just follow whatever he releases blindly. Not a great situation for anyone.': 4, "Well, I'm not surprised you didn't comprehend my comment, as you've shown time and again that your comprehension skills are lacking.\n\nHere.

Without such info, we cannot verify the true owner of an account to reset the 2FA. During those 7 days, any devices that did have access to the account would be getting a warning notification that a reset was requested. \n\nYour suggestion of warning users of the case of uninstalling and reinstalling the app is a valid concern and we'll incorporate it into our next release. \n\nApologies again for the inconvenience. \n": 3, "We've already put in a warning into our next release which will make it clear that an uninstall of the app or loss of phone will necessitate a reset which takes 7 days. Thanks again for the feedback ": 1, 'Just as any service where 2FA is enabled, if you are making major changes to your 2FA\'d accounts it\'s imperative to disable 2FA before you delete, change, reinstall, etc., and then (of course) re-enable it once you\'ve completed your action.\n\nLosing your 2FA token is just as serious as losing/forgetting your password. The whole point is to keep the bad guys out, and bad guys have a much harder time getting ahold of the magic two-factor token than they do your passwords (which can be guessed/cracked with relative ease). From a security point of view, there is no way for the app to tell the difference between you and somebody trying to guess your password. \n\nAirbitz\'s "one-touch 2FA" is stored in the phone and works in the background, so uninstalling the app obviously wipes it out (as it should). While it\'s unfortunate that you\'ve lost your token, the one-week wait (annoying, to be sure), is your friend in this case! \n\nIf Airbitz didn\'t have this recovery mechanism, there would be *no* way to get back into your account. Other services that have two-factor enabled, such as Coinbase for example, do not have a social-engineering-proof method for letting you back into your account. Their recovery methods are either open to social engineering attacks, or there is *no* recovery method. You\'re locked out of your data (in this case money!) forever! \n\nAirbitz at least provides a recovery mechanism immune to social engineering (since there is nobody to talk to who might be tricked into resetting your two-factor), even if it\'s slow and annoying. It\'s way better than never getting your account back. \n\nSome tips for the future: \n\nBefore deleting or uninstalling anything, go to settings and record whatever information you might need to restore or recover your account in the event any errors take place. In the case of Airbitz, this includes the answers to your password recovery questions and turning off 2FA (you can also export your wallet private seed from the wallet drop down list inside the app). Also, if you ever want to delete a bitcoin wallet app from a device, first send the funds to a new wallet that you definitely control. There are some really good temporary web/browser wallets out there, or if you have a large amount of bits not suitable for temporary storage in a hot wallet, use a hardware wallet or paper wallet with keys that were generated offline. Then uninstalling and reinstalling will be a lot less troublesome despite whatever errors may be encountered.': 1, "Thanks for the info and suggestions. I will take it all on board.

LN might be a great idea and we should be happy that people are working on it - but it sure ain\'t KISS.\n\n**Evolving viewpoints**\n\nA few years ago, I was actually suspicious of Mike (because of proof-of-passport) and Gavin (because of that meeting with the CIA) - and I preferred the idealistic and speculative mathematical and game-theory scenarios discussed by guys like Adam Back and Peter Todd. It was just so much more \xe2\x80\x9cclever\xe2\x80\x9d and hence more appealing to the side of me that likes complicated puzzles and idealized solutions in the realms of mathematics and programming.\n\nI have the greatest respect for Adam Back as a cryptographer, mathematician and innovator. For example, his proposals for "homomorphic encryption" which he shared on bitcointalk.org could provide the groundwork someday for much more anonymity in Bitcoin.\n\nAnd I have read and liked a lot of stuff from Peter Todd - from back when he dumped a bunch of his coins when cex.io got close to triggering a 51% mining threat, and his more complicated stuff regarding RBF. I like math and programming and I like clever complicated solutions!\n\nBut, after reading everything I could find in the past few months on both sides of the block size debate, I\'ve finally been getting some serious reminders about how starry-eyed and idealistic and *impractical* mathematicians and programmers can be. (I include myself in this group by the way \xe2\x80\x93 although I\xe2\x80\x99m not *great* at math or programming, I have studied and worked a lot in these areas.)\n\nMike has a lot of practical experience dealing with security and scaling at Google (plus also implementing LevelDB in Bitcoin, and implementing a Java client BitcoinJ paving the way for clients on Android), and Gavin has a lot of practical experience from his time as the lead maintainer of the original Bitcoin client - and they both show the kind of maturity and practicality and common sense (and understanding of scaling and game theory and economics and threat modeling) which are most important for ensuring the success of an open-source project. \n\n**Some reference material**\n\nIf you have time, I recommend perusing Mike\'s posts at the link below, where you see that not only has he done some important coding on Bitcoin (changing from Berkeley DB to LevelDB, writing BitcoinJ) but he also has a solid experience and understanding of how to prioritize issues involved in major programming projects:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/user/Mike_Hearn\n\nAnd I also recommend the recent video from Gavin, where he shows a clear understanding of governance and consensus on open-source projects:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8l11q9hsJM\n\nMeanwhile, although I was enthralled for a while with some of the innovative mathematical ideas from Adam and exotic game-theory threats from Peter, I no longer think that these things should be *prioritized* - to use a word which occurs frequently in Mike Hearn\'s discussion of threat models on Google Groups:\n\nhttps://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/bitcoin-xt/threat$20model/bitcoin-xt/zbPwfDf7UoQ/4uySXHVZCAAJ\n\nI myself can get heavily into mathematics and programming (and can often spend way too much time pursuing things in those areas which are *not* a priority), so I appreciate the "managerial" common sense and maturity displayed by people like Mike and Gavin to establish priorities and deal with the most important things first.\n\nI also think that Mike and Gavin have a much more realistic and practical understanding of "governance" and "consensus": namely, for a network running open-source code, there is *no such thing* as "developer consensus". *Anyone* (including an *anonymous* developer - anyone remember Satoshi Nakamoto?) can release *anything* they want - and then it is up to the *network* to decide to adopt it or not. This is the only real meaning of consensus. \n\nAnd, as Mike has stated elsewhere: if the code cannot be forked, then it\'s not open-source.\n\nThe biggest priority in the short term (for the next few years at least) is to *provide a simple scaling solution to support more user adoption, making maximal leverage of the stuff we already have: the existing code base and the available hardware and infrastructure*. This is the direction that Gavin and Mike have been focusing on. \n\n(By the way, as Mike has also pointed out elsewhere: *user adoption* itself is a very important metric of decentralization. If hundreds of millions more people start using the block chain directly in the next few years, this grassroots popularity really strengthens the system against many significant threats, such as interference from hostile state or corporate actors.)\n\nMeanwhile, I think Adam\'s work on LN is something which *could* be important for the *longer term* - while some of the areas which Peter have focused on (such as RBF and "scorched earth") might be merely marginal improvements - or might actually make the system worse.\n\n**Shower thought: What if Adam had been more of an early adopter?**\n\nThe other day I had a "shower thought" where I wondered what would happen if 1,000 people all donated 1 BTC each to Adam Back right now. \n\nEvidently Adam, while being a fine mathematician / cryptographer and the inventor of the Bitcoin forerunner HashCash, was actually *not* a big-time early adopter of Bitcoin, so he apparently doesn\'t have very much "skin in the game" in terms of actual stake as a holder **on the current level-0 block chain.**\n\nI sometimes wonder how things would be now if Adam had "gotten in on the ground floor" as an early "hodler". It might make him more inclined to work on providing improvements to **level-0** (the block chain), instead of going off in some other direction trying to invent some complicated new **level-1** system (Lightning Network). \n\n**KISS**\n\nRegarding the block size debate, we should apply the "KISS" principle here: "Keep It Simple, Stupid". \n\nBIP 101 follows this KISS approach, while LN and BIP 100 (and side-chains and other interesting proposed projects such as RBF) are non-KISS, and hence more risky, and hence should be *deprioritized* (or perhaps even *deprecated*). This is simply practical common sense based on the experience of successful managers of big projects including scaling open-source software. \n\nIn a nutshell: if space on the block chain is starting to look like it might get congested in the near future, and more hardware and infrastructure are available right now and in the foreseeable future, then we have a choice between...\n\n- *keeping the entire system and code base 99% the same* while simply increasing a constant (the max block size) and throwing some more hardware and bandwidth and memory and storage at the problem; versus\n\n- inventing a whole new level-1 protocol which could raise a whole bunch of hairy and unknown engineering and game-theory and and economics and centralization issues (not to mention the very real possibility of introducing *bugs* in the expanded code base and *vulnerabilities* in the more complicated network due to LN)\n\n...then it\'s a no-brainer that the first option is the safer choice to scale the network in the short term.\n\nYes I\'ve heard all the arguments that increasing the maximum block size could lead to more centralization - but this is something we can keep an eye on in advance. \n\n- Specifically, there are about 6,000+ nodes right now. If and when we get close to hard-forking to allow bigger blocks, *we will know in advance* whether there are still about 6,000 nodes on the network - or some other number which is still in some practical sense "acceptable", plus also in diverse enough jurisdictional and geographical locations - simply by looking here:\n\nhttps://getaddr.bitnodes.io/nodes/\n\n- As Mike has pointed out elsewhere, a web page itself typically is 2 MB in size, and the major driver of miner centralization has not been bandwidth - it\'s been things like the ASICS arms race, cooling, and electricity costs.\n\nMeanwhile, LN represents in some sense a kind of "hard fork" of an entirely different (ie much more complex) nature: Instead of simply changing just a single parameter while keeping 99% of the code and throwing more hardware at the problem, LN proposes making deep, major, "clever", non-KISS and unstudied changes in the architecture and topology (and game theory and economics) of the whole system itself.\n\nAnd BIP 100 proposed a more-complicated voting procedure - giving miners too much say regarding the block size, and introducing more unpredictability (since the votes could lead to a wildly fluctuating max block size over the years).\n\nManagers (and users and venture capitalists) *love* simple solutions where you can get 10x - 1000x - 10,000x scaling for the next few years (or decades) simply by throwing some more hardware and infrastructure at the problem, while leaving the existing codebase 99% unchanged. This is what BIP 101 does, and this is why people will adopt it instead of unproven, untried, untested, un-coded (vaporware) alternatives such as LN - or more complicated, unproven, untried, untested, riskier game-theory approaches such as BIP 100.\n\n**TL;DR: BIP 101 = KISS = Keep It Simple Stupid.**\n\n**Just change a parameter and throw some more hardware at the problem and don\'t change anything else - ie, go with BIP 101.**\n\n###\n\n\n': 2, '[removed]': 2, 'Well, the two top posts are about just that, so i guess not..\n\nhttps://en.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3k3kli/theymos_mike_hearns_view_is_similar_to_satoshis/?ref=share&ref_source=link\n\nhttps://en.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3k3c8m/nick_szabo_if_banks_want_benefits_of_blockchains/?ref=share&ref_source=link\n': 0, 'I really hope those conferences yield very positive results.

This is an alternative to the CHECKMULTISIG (CMS) way used in bitcoin.\n\nCMS is limited to 15 keys (or 20 if you don't use addresses) in Bitcoin. KTS has no concrete limits, though pubkey generation gets really slow when the number of possible solutions (N CHOOSE K) is too large.\n\nCMS takes time to verify proportional to the number of keys, an 8 of 15 can take 15x longer than a 1-of-1,  KTS verifies in effectively constant time and roughly as fast as a 1-of-1 regardless of the policy.\n\nCMS signatures have size linear in N+K,  KTS signatures have size related to log(N CHOOSE K) and are always at least half the size. For values of K near 1 or near N KTS is much more efficient than CMS. As an extreme example, a 1-of-million signature with KTS is under 1kB, while it would be many megabytes with CMS.\n\nKTS can efficiently support any monotone boolean function, not just plain thresholds.  E.g. (5 of 7) OR (2 of 3).  This means users using multi-signature security is not incompatible with multi-signature organizational policy: Your company can have 5 of 7 sign-off by directors which each use 2 of 3 security themselves.\n\nKTS shares with CMS the same basic good qualities-- E.g. the signers can tell which signers signed for audit purposes.

I guess it shows in the summary.\n\nThe main point is that this offers a new means of doing multisignature destinations in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. They are useful for example for funds that are controlled by a group of people, or for funds secured by keys in multiple devices (desktop and phone, and maybe a third party), or for escrow systems. In Bitcoin, some of these are possible already (and used!), but the system used in Bitcoin has downsides (it\'s not flexible, and it is expensive to the network).\n\nWhat Key Tree Signatures offer is mostly a generalization of what K-of-N multisig can do (it supports arbitrarily nested structures - what if you want to have 2-of-3 for shared funds, where one of the participants uses a multi device 2-of-2 wallet?), and it has very low cost to the network (in terms of size and validation time), so there is no cost to using security-enhancing features.\n\nFurthermore, because the difference is cost between one policy and a slightly more complex policy is minimal, it is cheap to add "dummies" into the mix, to hide my real procedures. For example, if VapourSoft tomorrow launches a fancy new wallet that by default uses 6-of-9 multisig, they are likely the only ones who do so. Seeing a 6-of-9 transaction on the blockchain would be a strong indication that it\'s a transaction by VapourWallet.\n\nFinally, how close is this to being usable in Bitcoin: it would require opcodes for Schnorr signature validation and Merkle tree branch validation. Thankfully, both already exist and are easily added using a softfork.': 1}, ('Check out this grassroots group in Ghana who are crowdfunding educational bitcoin seminars for local merchants in Africa.', 10): {"Yes!!

In Japan, the head of the last year with a crash failed Bitcoin platform Mt. Gox has been arrested for allegedly manipulates data and misappropriated client funds. In New York was an operator of an online currency exchange in court because he is said to have admitted that criminals could exchange Bitcoin against dollar, to launder money. Shortly thereafter, the cryptocurrency lost on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange "BitFinex" briefly a third of their value. Cared As so often in just six year history Bitcoin negative headlines. Given the extreme price fluctuations, the constant hacker attacks and other scams you could say so: The digital currency Revolution which was founded in 2008 by a developer using the pseudonym "Satoshi Nakamoto" proclaimed and received enthusiastically by techies, anarchists and other free spirits, devours its children.\n\nBut it is too early for a swansong. For all the problems despite having Bitcoin 2009 enthusiastically welcomed and declared dead in the past two years every now and again, affecting the wider economy. Even someone who does not want to escape for ideological reasons the conventional monetary system as some liberals or libertarians, who discovered the advantages of Internet money. Dealers and customers, large financial institutions to central banks already have more than one eye on the digital currency and especially the technology. The New York Stock Exchange has even recently launched its own index. The NYSE Bitcoin index tracked trading in international stock markets and ultimately represents a kind of official Bitcoin price in dollars. At present, a Bitcoin will cost about 228 dollars. However, this is not even a fifth of what was worth to her wedding two years ago the Internet currency.\n\nThe followers of Internet currency, whether from the German FDP or a Californian subculture, like have been raised in the tradition of Economics Nobel Prize winner Friedrich August von Hayek. Because the representative of the Austrian school forty years ago doubted that central banks can keep the value of money stable and crisis-proof, he propagated a "denationalization of money". Would private currencies authorized, Hayek\'s idea of \xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8bthe state money would have to prove in a competitive environment. But no state of the world thinks of someone taking the currency monopoly out of hand. Federal Finance Minister Wolfgang Sch\xc3\xa4uble has the Internet currency Although recognized two years ago as a unit. But the euphoria German Bitcoin supporters he braked prompt: A "label" this is not. Recently laid by Sch\xc3\xa4uble, by "a suspected area" designated crypto currencies, as a kind of contaminated terrain.\nTo Inflation nobody should be in the Bitcoin world, however, worry\n\nBitcoin like two of the three main characteristics of money to meet: It is used as a unit and as a medium of exchange. Why it did not is good, is saving. Although there are fans who have gained in the early phase of a few Bitcoin at a bargain price, you keep on hard drive and USB flash drive and hope for capital appreciation. But larger sums of money to invest in real Bitcoin, which recommend themselves lead developer of the software. Until further notice remain the currency "an experiment" warns the Bitcoin developer Gavin Andresen: "When I hear that someone puts his life savings in digital money, I cringe." Because the price of Bitcoin to dollars or euros only through regulate supply and demand on the Internet exchanges, the price can drop abruptly when someone loses the desire for his crypto money and sold it.\n\nTo Inflation nobody has to worry in the Bitcoin world, however. The total amount is limited to 21 million. In the virtual world, users can put a few Bitcoin for a rainy day when they calculate regularly all completed transactions within the network and confirm. This verification, called mining "not only makes work. It also requires each time a higher computing power - which can also increase the cost of electricity.\n\nRecently, however, considerable interest is even at banks, have only ignored and then viewed with suspicion Bitcoin, awakens. The American investment bank Goldman Sachs has contributed $ 50 million in the Bitcoin payment service provider Circle. The Swiss bank UBS explored whether the application behind Bitcoin technology further brings their daily operations. "Block chain" means the chain of transactions that can track all network members. Even Bundesbank Executive Carl-Ludwig Thiele, libertarian Gedankenguts rather unsuspicious can "block chain" abgewinnen much good. The management of all for all "ensures transparency and can protect against manipulation," says Thiele.\n\nAlarmed, banks and payment service providers are, however, because it allows "block chain" that transfers vonstattengehen quickly and inexpensively. Transfers abroad or remote parts of the world, where perhaps people have no bank account, but an Internet access, do not pass through intermediate banks and therefore do not take several days, but no more than ten minutes. And the costs often account for only one-tenth of what demand money senders as Western Union of its customers. The banks are in a dilemma: Make the block chain technology advantage to them facilitates one hand the work. On the other hand it would have painful consequences for them. The cashless payments around the globe makes a year from more than 400 trillion, which the financial institutions brings $ 600 billion revenue. Do you offer cheap foreign transfers to block chain base to shrink necessarily their own income.\n\nThe block chain may survive as art - but what future for Bitcoin as a currency? Governments and central banks will not let the power over the money take. In addition, Internet giant will offer its own payment services or how Google Wallet or ApplePay, evolve so that Bitcoin might fall by the wayside.\n\nAnother major threat to cryptocurrency comes from among their own followers. Because the Bitcoin community threatens to divide itself: One group, led by two leading developers, wants to expand the limited since each technical capacity and make Bitcoin order for the masses. This group, including developers Andresen, has now introduced a new crypto version called Bitcoin XT. By contrast, the other group is concerned that Bitcoin this would be an ordinary transfer system - which the revolutionary original idea of \xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8bthe inventors led ad absurdum.\n\nSo it could be that the former currency of the future will soon be past, only the technology behind it persists. But it is also possible that Bitcoin as a unit and a medium of exchange is becoming more popular. It would not be the first time that the Internet Totgesagte currency would live longer.': 5, 'The Bitcoin currency experiment\n\nBitcoin is virtual money, for which no state guarantee. It is just as attractive as for anarchists for bankers.\n\nSince there Bitcoin, the world is divided. Proponents of digital currency rave about the money without State interference, by a domination-free monetary zone and the biggest upheaval since the existence of the Internet. The others hold Bitcoin for unregulated and downright dangerous because it opens anarchists and criminals floodgates for windy shops. In times of financial crises when central banks pumping immense amounts of money in the market or States are on the verge of bankruptcy, the fans of Internet currency to see confirmed. In phases when Bitcoin towards state clearly currencies lose value and constantly aware new criminal activities on the Internet exchanges, the skeptics have the upper hand. Either way leads to Bitcoin and behind it forming technology in future hardly a way past: at the expense of banks, for the benefit of bank customers and, as die-hard fans say, to the delight of the whole world.\n\nAt first glance, appear to be extremely strange Bitcoin currency. Even the name is misleading. Because there are no coins to touch, but in Bitcoin is a pure arithmetic unit, which is stored in a digital land registry. The book has not been centrally but by the computers of all users, who are grouped together to form a network. Whoever acquires Bitcoin, so do not buy money to touch, but an encrypted formula - why Bitcoin is also referred to as crypto currency.\nBitcoin - the system appears abstract\n\nBitcoin has, like all the other currencies which consist only of letters and numbers, a problem: The system seems abstract. Just the idea that not states and central banks regulate the money market but networked computers is, for many people, who have grown up in the traditional financial system, difficult to imagine. And that money is only based on crypto algorithms and can not be touched and passed as coins or bills, just to cash in love Germans must seem like an absurdity. In addition, the technology seems complicated for many who have not grown up with the Internet and have just become accustomed to perform most banking transactions online.\n\nAnyone wanting to use Bitcoin only to pay or trade, can register with a provider, download the software and then buy from the Internet exchanges Bitcoin against Euro. The virtual currency unit then ends up, as in everyday life, in a wallet that is on the Internet "Wallet" and is stored on your computer or smartphone. When shopping with Bitcoin you type his personal code into the smartphone or in a Bitcoin terminal. So basically it does not much different than online banking.\n\nAs a unit of account, the Internet currency is receiving increasing support. There are now more than 100, 000 merchants that accept Bitcoin as a means of payment such as a credit card - just that during the settlement with the national currency incurred less fees. In some Berliner bars can pay for his beer into Bitcoin, in a hair salon in Hannover his haircut. The most attention received churches in America and England that accept Bitcoin for the collection. The most popular is the cryptocurrency at online retailers and their customers: companies such as Microsoft, Tesla, Dell and Expedia accept Bitcoin, also via PayPal are Bitcoin payments recently possible. And who ordered his food at Edeka online, can pay via BitPay since this spring. Bananas, bread and butter for Bitcoin - which is the norm? Still is the Internet currency "a niche cash," says Bernhard Rohleder, Director General of the Digital association Bitkom. But he believes that Bitcoin "established as a complement to other means of payment" in the next few years mainly because of lower transaction fees.\n\nAt present about 100 000 times a day is paid with Bitcoin around the world; what is a trifle compared with the 65 million transfers and direct debits, which are settled in Germany alone on weekdays. If you follow, however the results of a representative survey of Bitkom, the mainstream of society could achieve Bitcoin might. 36 percent of Germans - and eleven percent more than in 2014 - can imagine to buy Bitcoin or use. This corresponds to 25 million potential users in this country.\n\nThe great attraction of this alternative and decentralized monetary system is that members make to each other shops without a middleman or a bank is turned on and causes costs. The great confidence of all users ahead of each other. Bitcoin enables "people to free themselves from the tyranny of centralized trust" as Michael Casey and Paul Vigna in her recently published book in German "crypto-currency" write. Although it sounds so, Casey and Vigna are not revolutionaries, but seasoned business journalists of the Wall Street Journal.\n\nIn the fight for the recognition of Internet currencies occasionally develop unusual alliances. A fantasy bookstore from the alternative milieu Berlin-Kreuzberg in the same boat as a noble Franke, who was for a time as Germany schillerndster and full of promise most politicians: Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg places powerful for Internet currencies over backwards. The financial system is now "outdated and inefficient", quibbled former CSU Minister and now consultant in one of his rare interviews now. Therefore Krypto currencies would offer "a tremendous opportunity to make our established payment and money remittance system simpler and cheaper".\nRecently there have been many negative headlines': 6, 'Good old FAZ ...': 1}, ('Help using bitcoin (business)', 0): {"Yes we both agree that ease is important- my point was most wallets now let u specify how much in local currency.
