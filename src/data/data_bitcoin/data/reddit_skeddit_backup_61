Wladimir takes an approach that I feel is, despite all protestations, a bit similar (but not definitely not the same). Take, for example, the CLTV soft fork. Everybody who actively followed its development was cool with it by the end...except Mike Hearn, who was dead-set on it being deployed as a hard fork. He loudly disagreed and basically demanded that the code, which everybody else was fine with being implemented as a soft fork, be implemented as a hard fork. As usual, Redditors got whipped up into a frenzy and decried Mike, Greg, Adam\'s barber, and everybody else they could because drama. In the end, Wladimir merged the code anyway.\n\nMy baseless speculation is that Wladimir decided that Mike, whether or not Mike honestly believed his own writings (Mike probably did, to be fair), was creating distractions and otherwise being stubborn. If somebody\'s just throwing up roadblocks and playing the political game, one could argue that they\'re not needed for consensus. It\'s a dangerous game.

Then I read more about it...\n\nQuantum computers can find factors of numbers in a way that doesn't totally suck like today's conventional processors. Encryption works because we take long prime numbers and add some fancy exponents, so it ends up being impossible to figure out how to turn the information back into something useful. Quantum computers however, can find these huge prime factors, making many of the encryption methods we use today obsolete. In fact, with enough money you can probably rent a quantum computer (and a team) to factor something for you.\n\nYou want this article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-quantum_cryptography\n\nWhen you make a wallet, you are generating a privatekey which is used to make a publickey which is used to make the wallet address. When you make a transaction, you have to sign it with your private key so the network will agree that the funds have been transfered (network sees that the math checks out). That process permanently inscribes in the blockchain your signed transaction (as designed), but the fear is someday you would be able to take that transaction and determine the private key through something like the factoring I discussed above. To avoid this problem, you simply generate a new address and move all the funds for every transaction or right after.\n\nTL;DR: To quantum-proof your Bitcoin, the funds are safe at any address you control until you post an outbound transaction (you send any amount of Bitcoin to anyone). So if you have spent BTC but still have some left at that address, simply make a new address and send them there for safe keeping.

Basically, the problem with sidechains is that there is a fixed peg to Bitcoin, so regardless of the innovation of the sidechain, the price of that side-coin isn't allowed to fluctuate in relation to Bitcoin's price.\n\n> I would also argue that an unpegged, and therefore more volatile, currency exchange is superior to a pegged, purely sidechain, system. An unpegged system allows for the free market to adapt to the value of each altcoin based on its usefulness. This will drive the most resources into the most valuable parts of the overall cryptocurrency ecosystem.\n": 2, 'The fallacy of bitcoin maximalism is the delusion that any special feature can be easily copied into Bitcoin or a sidechain. There are otherwise intelligent people that really believe such BS. ': 0, "This is false.\n\nThe pegging is not necessarily fixed and you can have things like e.g., demurrage on the tokens or even valuation based on some fixed schedule, voting mechanism or oracle input. The only limitation is that if X bitcoins get in no more than X bitcoins can get out. This makes a ceiling for the exchange rate against BTC but, if pegging is permissionless, this is more of a feature than a bug: mainnet bitcoins would simply flood in if the exchange rate ever got above parity.\n\nFurthermore, sidechains can have issuance on their own that is mixable with the pegged-in inputs. I expect that in this case the sidechain tokens be not fungible and its worth depend on how much of the coin history is BTC and how much is worthless inflation. But other users' valuations could differ.": 2, 'Proponents of the term *Bitcoin maximalism* will often argue that the *only Bitcoin is valuable* tenet comes from the subjective perceptions of mainnet stakeholders who are invested in it. Contrarily, my argument is that it is a quite natural property of cryptocurrency as a whole and that as such is equally valid for non-stakeholders.': 2, "Well, you *can allow more than that* it is just that then there may not be enough BTC for everyone in case of a bank run on the sidechain side. In other words, it is technically possible, just undesirable as a fair system.\n\nIf you accept, as I mentioned, that limited supply is advantageous for the whole cryptocurrency ecosystem, then this is a strength not a limitation. Altchain (non-pegged) proliferation is practically free, and as such it leads to unlimited inflation for any non-zero value of their tokens. A single chain is cheaper and more secure, and because of these and Metcalfe's law, more valuable. It is therefore an attractor of the collective dynamics.\n\nPersonally, I do not find demurrage, redistribution or oracle-based valuation any valuable (so I would stick with fixed-pegging sidechains) but other may value these; the presence of variable pegging does not affect my proposition.": 1, 'Oh now that The Other Coins price is going down this kind of posts are coming up.

As such, it can very simply copied as a one-way-pegged sidechain, which is enough for what I have enunciated (security at least for the pre-pegging leg, and lack of inflation).\n\nIf we want two-way pegging, which may ensure stronger value preservation, have a look at Sztorc's drivechains http://www.truthcoin.info/blog/drivechain/ . They can be done on nearly everything, even open ledgers that are not blockchains, and they have the additional advantage of security preservation incentives.\n\nThese require no specific adaptation form the Bitcoin side, and very minimal adaptation to the sidechain.": 3, 'No. Spamming every crypto user on every crypto sub for weeks on end pumping a premined ipo shitcoin is disgusting.': 3}, ("Y'all have been ignoring this but I find it to be extremely interesting and bullish...", 56): {'"Haha, we do that in the federal government sometimes..."': 2, 'TLDW?': 3, ">The US House Subcommittee on Commerce, Manufacturing and Trade held a meeting on digital currencies and blockchain technology today, exploring the technology's characteristics as well as its regulatory and legislative implications.\n\n>The panel of experts at the meeting included Circle CCO John Beccia; Coin Center executive director Jerry Brito; IBM vice president of blockchain technologies Jerry Cuomo; Factom chief architect Paul Snow; BuckleySandler LLP counsel Dana Syracuse; Coinbase counsel Juan Suarez; and Bloq co-founder Matt Roszak.\n\nhttp://www.coindesk.com/us-congressional-subcommittee-holds-intro-hearing-on-bitcoin-and-blockchain/": 4, "There's a big difference between ignoring and actually knowing something is occurring.": 10, 'why would that be bullish?': 1, 'Jerry Brito is *Boss*': 1, 'thx for posting.': 2, 'Bullish as Fuck!, the pain drawn on their all knowing faces as they have to acknowledge Bitcoin as a currency haha. ;D) \n\nPerfect!...
