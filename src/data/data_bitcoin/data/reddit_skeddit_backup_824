It's still an emerging technology.\n\nI believe a screen is required by most weights and measures regulations. Even the size of the lettering is typically specified. However, regulations can be revised if there is enough interest as technologies evolve.. If you watch my first demonstration video, you will see an HTML based interface that I developed.

Really good work. I have some questions/feedback:\n\n1) \n\nLove how the UX is all in the Bitcoin wallet and barely on the pump, more sanitary too.\n\nToday, I start by making payment arrangements, then interact with the pump nozzle; not the other way around. This is how the public has been trained. Could the NFC chip constantly be broadcasting or is that a no-no? Eg. Always broadcasting while waiting customer to approach, pay, then engage the pump.\n\n2)\n\nIf you only pumped 7.5 mBTC, you would\'ve received that refund automatically, instantly, and documented on the paper receipt correct?\n\nI generally pre-auth $100 and fill up to an unknown amount.\n\n\n3) \n\nI understand you didn\'t create the protocol but: Does the payment protocol allow for any additional retailer options to be passed? It would be sweet if "paper receipt" was a checkbox in the wallet app payment screen, because the dispenser passed that to the app as a question for the user.': 4, "Refilling in America is always a pain in the ass for me, as a European, because none of the fuel pumps accept my credit card. They always seem to ask for my ZIP code, which of course I don't have, so then I have to go into the shop and they process it there by hand, but they don't do EMV/Chip-and-PIN either so it's a bit of a crapshoot whether it works or not (my bank hardly ever rejects transactions but I know other people who aren't so lucky).\n\n": 1, 'I like it, well done': 4, "This right here is why Bitcoin will continue to rise.

The reason the nozzle has to be removed first is because it is a proof of work indicating the customer has a real intention to make a purchase. I could choose to add a button for this but the user is already going to remove the nozzle anyway, so it's an extra unecessary step. The proof of work is needed because a new bitcoin address is generated for each customer, after the customer has indicated a payment would like to be made. The goal is to reduce the number of unused bitcoin addresses and also not allow anyone to harvest bitcoin addresses that a pump issues before a customer makes payment (this improves the privacy and security of the system). So, QR code is not displayed and NFC radio is off on the disenser until they remove the nozzle.\n\n2. Please check out some of my previous videos. I'll also be creating another video soon that demonstrates the refund process using the bitcoin payment protocol.\n\n3. There are a lot of extensions that can be made to the payment protocol to improve the process. I'm only interested in supporting features that I'm confident will be adopted by many wallet creators, so what gets included will be determined over time as discussion occurs with the wallet creators.": 3, '@/u/andyschroder: Very nice work on the direct Bluetooth communications. Extremely impressive. Two questions:\n\n1. Does the QR code support initiating the Bitcoin Payment Protocol over Bluetooth like the NFC does?\n2. Does the Bluetooth connection support synchronizing the wallet with the block chain? One could imagine making multiple consecutive payments in "offline" mode like this and thus running out of confirmed outputs to spend, necessitating a sync with the block chain to find new spendable outputs.': 9, 'Hey, great invention.

I'm sure you've considered micropayment channels. Seems like that would run hand in hand with this. \n\nSomeone recently posted an excellent code demonstration of opening and closing a micropayment channel using Erlang and Bitcore. That way you circumvent the need for an explicit prepay. ": 10, 'Screen is color and 720p, however, black and white is currently used right now because it provides higher contrast in direct sunlight.': 3, 'great job! good luck to you \n\nedit: sent tip to support your work': 1, "> Also, I don't know of any bitcoin wallet GUI that even supports micropayments right now, so it is hard to demonstrate in a simple way.\n\nActually, I implemented support for this in Bitcoin Wallet for Android some time ago:\n\nhttps://github.com/schildbach/bitcoin-wallet/commits/payment-channels\n\nThis branch is now quite far behind master, but it provides full support. It exposes a Binder/IPC based API to other apps. They can request permission to spend some of the users money, and there's a permissions screen that lets the user specify how much to allow the app to use. Then the app can request a micropayment channel be built. The wallet hands back serialized protobuf messages that the app is responsible for getting to the micropayment channel server in whatever way is appropriate (it'd be bluetooth in your case). When the app receives a message from the server, again, it's relayed to the wallet via IPC.\n\nI prototyped an actual app that used this interface, it worked OK, though it was somewhat fiddly.\n\nThat said it's probably unnecessary here. Your fuel pump is signing its BIP70 requests, so your reputation is on the line if the machine screws someone over. Micropayment channels don't really make much sense unless the device issuing the payments has a way to know how much of a service it's received, so here, you'd need the car itself to measure the fuel it was getting and keep paying to get the next few seconds of flow. More effort than it's worth.\n\nBTW, it's awesome to see someone really engaged in this sort of innovation. I worked on Bluetooth, NFC and BIP70 support with Andreas over the past couple of years, actually the first ever NFC Bitcoin transaction was in my old Google office. So it's great to see you do something neat with all the technologies we've put together.": 3, 'The payee must have an internet connection. This can usually be a stable wired connection because the payee is normally in a fixed location that they own or rent. If they are a mobile vendor then they may need to have a dedicated cellular internet plan with a high gain antenna mounted on the top of their vehicle (if in a remote area). The point is that the payee is usually in a lot more control or knowledge of the location of sale (and therefor the internet connection), whereas a payer is not (particularly with fuel sales).': 1, 'Wow!': 7, "1. QR code can initiate the bitcoin payment protocol over bluetooth, however, BIP72 only supports one URL which isn't good for backwards compatibility. I will be proposing a new draft BIP in a few days that will expand the number of URLs that can be provided. So, as of right now I have the QR code configured for https based payment protocol, and will be producing another video soon that shows payment protocol over https.\n\n2. This is an issue and it has been suggested by someone else to do what you are saying. I'll have to discuss this with the wallet developers to see what their thoughts are. The best way to do it would be to add a field to the payment protocol to pass the data. I'm not sure how desired this would be though because it then puts sole trust in the payee to provide valid blockchain data and Bitcoin is supposed to be a trustless system.": 4}, ("Bitcoin's Killer Apps", 6): {}, ('LIVE from Hong Kong, HK Gov breaks off scheduled talks for Friday - 9th October 2014(Recording of live broadcast on World Crypto Network WCN) with time stamps', 8): {'Alright guys full timestamps are here.

If the State approves the document, it protects the business and employees from criminal and punitive monetary litigation, strictly limited to the operations outlined in the statement.  Litigation can only determine that such-and-such a practice is illegal (so cease and desist) but not criminalize or punish in another fashion the mistake for the first offender.  \n\nWithout any criminal or punitive measures, the business clearly has the option to cease and desist without even going to court.  Subsequent infractions (presumably not covered by a "statement of business") by any individual or business could be criminally prosecuted.  Of course, the State could retract approval of any statement with 30-90 days of notice, etc.\n\nOption: the State offers the same money for the defense as it is spending on the prosecution.  After all, clarity around poorly worded regulations is a public good.  Finding this clarity should not be the exclusive financial responsibility of the first person to stumble upon the poor regulation.\n\nSo for example a physical bitcoin company could file a statement essentially like:\n"People send me Bitcoins.  I mint a physical coin made from silver, print a private key on it and return an equivalent value of Bitcoin in physical form minus my fee.  This is not money transfer or exchange because a person gives me bitcoins and I give them bitcoins back in a slightly different form.  So in effect value is not transferred.  This is not a bank because customer Bitcoins are not held for more than 48 working hours (the time it takes to make and ship the physical coins).   Therefore I don\'t need a money transfer or banking license."\n\nIf a statement like the above is accepted, the State could later determine that in fact such behavior DOES require a license.  But could not criminally prosecute the individual as part of that determination.': 1, 'Montana\'s, (your), commissioner of political practices, Jonathan Motl, has already had conversations, (correspondence), with a Montana political candidate, Eric Fulton, about taking bitcoin campaign donations, you can find Mr. Motl\'s response to the Fulton campaign here:\n\nhttp://politicalpractices.mt.gov/content/5campaignfinance/EricFultonBitcoinUseOpinion\n\nAnd indeed, Mr. Fulton did have a bitcoin campaign donations page on his campaign website and continues to maintain that page here:\n\nhttp://www.fultonformontana.com\n\nEric Fulton, the candidate, we can see a bit about here:\n\nhttp://ballotpedia.org/Eric_Fulton\n\nEric lost the primary and is not on the ballot, however you appear, certainly, to be on the ballot: http://ballotpedia.org/Nicholas_Schwaderer\n\nAs there are currently no candidates for office in Montana accepting bitcoin campaign donations, (that are on the ballot), and you also appear to be favored to retain your seat and win your incumbency, (as we observe your previous election win was substantially in your favor), you have an opportunity to accept bitcoin campaign donations and then actually win your race.\n\nYou would then be the first politician from Montana to win an election, and the first incumbent, (in Montana and potentially in the U.S.), to win their election, while exercising a bitcoin campaign donations strategy.\n\nThere has been to date no incumbent candidate seeking re-election to office that has won their race for re-election while accepting bitcoin donations.\n\nOnly two candidates, bitcoin candidates, stand to be the first incumbent candidates ever to win an election while exercising a bitcoin campaign donations strategy, and those candidates are Jared Polis and California Lt.

Electrum did the same thing when they showed the QR with the seed. the mnemonic was written, but the QR had the seed in binary data format.\n3. BIP39 was made with trezor in mind. This is why the use cases that seem to be at the pretense of the BIP are based on the "backup one HD wallet with one seed" and not "encode arbitrary data" if you want to use BIP39 to encode arbitrary data, as long as you have the word list when decoding, you can just reverse the encoding step. If you want to import specific accounts, use the xprv xpub format, or decode the base58 and take the binary data of the xprv and encode it in the BIP39 style if you want. No one\'s stopping you.\n4. Again, you have to recognize the context that this BIP was designed under. You can use BIP39\'s method and change it however you would like, no one is stopping you. Seeing as BIP39 is just a method of tying a phrase with a BIP32 seed. If you want every BIP to include every possible use case that anyone can think up (without ever even using it) then nothing would ever get finalized.\n\nThat being said, I suggest following bips more closely, put it on your watch list and chime in whenever a new addition is made.

As far as I can tell, this is the ONLY way to import an HD wallet into Mycelium (I realize this is a Mycelium issue, not BIP39) and I get the feeling that this is generally the way key import is done.\n\nMaybe what I\'m looking for isn\'t a way to fix BIP39, but rather a better proposal to work with key import of (BIP44) HD wallet accounts into wallet software.

The list suggestions also say "the first 4 letters should be unique" which is to help auto-correction implementation on wallet side. Think of the checksum as just an optional helper for "order correction"\n2. For your use case, you would still need to manage two BIP39 phrases anyways. (one for your main account and one for your sub account) So if you want to stay standard, just manage your accounts separately to begin with, i.e. with separate root seeds to begin with. I understand the "utility" of your idea sounds better and more easy and simple, but in the end, it would still require a wallet developer to make a UI function that can handle importing sub-wallets from other wallets using mnemonics... or in my suggestion, a function to manage two mnemonic wallets on the same wallet. \n\nHowever, you can always generate an xprv key for the sub-account with the BIPs we have now if you must have this functionality. But like I said, no wallets support this. (in fact only a few wallets support BIP39 to begin with)\n\nThis is not being snotty or anything, but if you think that methodology for detatching sub-accounts as mnemonics and being able to import sub-accounts via those mnemonics, that actually sounds like a good idea for a new BIP. But BIP39 is not about HD wallets at all, so any suggestion to add such a functionality to it will be rejected.

If you read my other comments in this thread you\'ll see that I\'ve revised my opinion a bit and really only have a problem with the way BIP39 is used as a format for importing accounts (which is obviously not the fault of the BIP itself), and how the checksum verification is so easily overlookable.\n\nObviously I can modify BIP39 (or any other BIP) to suite my own needs, but real goal here is to be able to store multiple copies of an HD wallet in a format that could be understood by my heirs in case of my death, so only "standard" approaches are acceptable here.': 2, "Trezor can't store a 1,000 word list?": 1, '> I agree it\'s less than ideal.

So, you could turn a TREZOR (BIP39) mnemonic string into an Electrum seed if you wanted to move your coins there, but you couldn\'t take an existing Electrum seed and turn it into a BIP39 string.': 1, '> Unless you can recognize and normalize the words\n\nThat\'s what I meant by "if the words ARE supported."

IF you don\'t do PBKDF2, and ONLY encode your child key data (in place of the entropy) using the encoding method of BIP39, then reverse the encoding method to decode the data back into the original data (the child key) you COULD do it.

I couldn\'t poke a hole in the logic either until I realized the nodes aren\'t networking at speeds comparable to data centers for large hubs like the Atlantic seaboard for example.\n\nHere\'s why part-time is not as effective as full-time nodes. The uploading/downloading ratio is entirely incidental to the way nodes work in this context; namely because your client keeps a list of nodes it "knows" are able to relay information. \n\nYes, you\'re certainly sending out more data, but it\'s the info your peers missed in theirs or your down time which isn\'t being validated and getting consensus that is problematic. Another say to put it; it\'s not the uptime, it\'s the reliability that misunderstandings can and will be communicated. \n\nA good, familiar analogy; torrent downloads when it\'s filled with peers but not enough seeds. 98% of a video isn\'t good enough for a torrent. In a very similar way, that is what is happening here. The lack of incentive (meaning lower node numbers) exacerbates the issue, yes. \n\nWhoever brought up miners just needing UTXOs is problematic moreso than a helpful feature would be my opinion too. Miners are greatly incentivized already to secure the network, but the hash rate of pools makes their contribution *somewhat* more important. I\'m not up up speed on DRK supernodes but if they improve P2P relay efficiency/functionality then it\'s a pretty cool idea. That being said, it\'s a DRK thing, not a bitcoin thing. \n\nBut hopefully the torrent part is the take home message here...

The banks (or perhaps apple/google/paypal) aren't going to lose that race.  As a decentralized movement, Bitcoin users and entrepreneurs cannot and will not be as organized in affecting the main hurdles to innovation (which are government controls, subsidizations of incumbent systems, etc.).  Technology is not the main barrier for achieving the kinds of payment innovations and outcomes that we're talking about.  Whatever Circle or Coinbase can or will do to add ease-of-use and efficiency to transfering fiat over bitcoin (which will necessarily be off-blockchain and centralized), banks/paypal/apple/google will be able to do just as well, and probably better because they already own the government apparatus.  In the first world, transfers between users of different banks is already almost free and very quick and very secure. . . . the problem is in having to use fiat, and having to trust the banks and the government.  Most of what you people who view bitcoin shallowly think are it's advantages, are easily matched with innovations in interface.

Centralized technology (all things equal) is going to have an easier time, technically, in achieving ubiquity, standards, and ease of use.\n\nI fully agree with your view on the merits of open-source vs. walled garden; but walled garden often does win out for a while (while the open standards lag behind but build a very strong value base in the background); Bitcoin is not just some open-source version of the banks and their fiat payment rails.  Bitcoin is an open-source trust and value transmission mechanism and repository.  It doesn't even compete directly with what banks do.  And Bitcoin was founded, to start with, on a technology which is not conducive to quick payments, or even necessarily cheap payments.  It is founded on technology which is conducive to secure payments, and the benefits of no counter-party risk.  Yes, right now, in their stagnant state, the banks and other payment processors don't necessarily offer cheaper or quicker payments than bitcoin;  but using centralized networks, it is and will be trivially easy for them to lower costs to the consumer and provide all sorts of features which mimic and exceed the best that Bitcoin can offer in terms of ease of use, speed, and fees, and even things that mimic multi-sig transactions, etc.  Their expenses per transaction may be higher than the bitcoin network right now; but their barriers to rectifying that are small.  Bitcoin will always need the relatively expensive mining process, and (at least for larger transactions) will always need the verification and confirmation process of the blockchain; which is just simply slow.  That's the reality of it.  I'm well aware of the many methods (such as the off-chain ones, or the ntimelock feature) which can and will make cheaper faster and micropayments feasible. . . but ultimately, the bitcoin blockchain is and will be what it is.  \n\nI don't consider it inferior; because my values lie in the money aspect of bitcoin and the trustless mechanism.

With gradually increasing limits, we will have two different variables relevant to adoption (scarcity of the supply, and scarcity of capacity), which is bad.\n\nSecond is demand of security. If block reward becomes negligible, but number of transactions don't increase dramatically, people might prefer to pay higher fees to keep the level of security high. This will inevitably be the case if the block size stays at 1M, too, but that almost certainly means dominion of off-chain or side-chain transactions, which is a completely different topic.\n\nIn summary, it is not very likely to end up with too high fees, but as you said it's not a done deal.\n": 3, 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_Orbit_Ion_Cannon\n': -2, "Bitcoin transactions, by its nature, is a push action.

And yes, that has happened before with a $500 computer purchase. If I had given the money back, I would have immediately gone out of business. The first six months when I opened my computer store, I was eating top ramen to survive.\nIt is much easier for a customer to choose their merchant than it is for a merchant to choose customers. For instance, when I tried to limit Ebay sales to those who had an account for at least one year, I got a lot of flack from Ebay. Ebay also as a general policy prevents merchants from posting negative reviews about customers. The only way is to vote a positive rating and write "scammer" in the comment field.\nAs a customer, you have a lot of information about a merchant. But as a merchant, you have very little information about a customer. A customer can order merchandise from different merchants, get the order, return a brick, then file a claim.

Plus, the idea that USA laws will protect us only works for sales from USA companies. The other piece of the picture is that Bitcoin , being rather tiny in comparison to the major credit/debit cards lacks klout with merchants. Merchants must remain in good standing with those cards and can rack up fees from the cards for returns. Too many returns in comparison to sales is a red flag. Since Bitcoins are an anonymous entity, meaning there is no way to distinguish one Bitcoin from another, restoring them is difficult. Yet, Bitcoin has been understood as more that a currency, it is also viewed as an investment vehicle. (Again, buyer beware!)

If you propose a business plan on how to get local cooperation on board (localized advertising have better impact), you can easily raise capital for 100x pi's overnight. Just do a reasonably big safety deposit for the guys handling the equipment, and you should be good to go. Getting this up&running (subscriptionless, cryptofunded internet) could easily be claimed as a functional precursor to true meshnet internet access.\n\nIf your business is to sell those raspberries at cost, and grab a certain share of the ad/use revenue, you could scale way faster if you farm out local business deals, situating & debt funding. \n\nSelling free wifi will be hard (3g+existing infrastructure), but thus thing has the potential of getting bandwidth down to the price of electricity by fostering perfect competition ( clode to what bitcoin mining have done).\n\nNow getting such a network up&running, hosts can get rewarded from how much traffic are actually used, this can be incentive to get a seriously big uplink, so you'd get better internet speeds at the bus stop than you'd get at home(!). People are already sharing wifi with their neighbors today, and getting such a device would make it way easier to split costs evenly. Recruiting existing providers into running your free wifi setup instead could be an easy switchover if you prove to not suck balls. Hooking this up to a 4G uplink could make a free wifi anywhere situation.\n\nWhen you scale properly, you suddenly have the following: a shitlod of customers CURRENTLY PAYING TOO MUCH for internet.

But I'm not quite sure if it's feasible.\n\nFor one, I'd like to see every single bitcoin company, particularly the 'embassies', buy one right away and advertise it on their window.\n\nBut beyond that. I mean let's be real, my wifi has a range of about 30 meters. This thing is really hyperlocal. For anyone to happen upon this in a city like London is about 1 in ten thousand. It's quite different from say, an ATM that you know is there and you can just travel to to do something you'd otherwise have a lot of trouble doing. You really need great communication (search, findability) as well as pretty good volume for this to take off.\n\nTwo other things I'd love to see you do is one, implement an opt-out feature to publish the location of the bitcoin wifi to an online map server. This map will fade out any bitcoin wifi's that haven't published their location in the past 48 hours. I think that'd be really useful.\n\nNext up, contact Raspberry Pi. They're an awesome bunch of guys, although they have a huge focus on kids education stuff (for which the Pi was designed) they tend to give exposure to some cool projects. Particularly when you get some funding and can build a cool little 45 second animated video or something to showcase the idea, you'd be able to get a lot of exposure at the loads of hacker/makerspace/arduino/raspberrypi type communities. I think not only will this give you a boost in exposure, I think it'd also have a chance of inspiring other bitcoin-based projects. (so much internet-of-things potential.)\n\nThen, I'd love for you to, when you're ready, start reaching out to various cafes that offer internet access. Perhaps you could configure the network to offer a free 150 Kbit/s for email type stuff, and a bitcoin-powered 10 mbit/s network for people looking to do some real work.\n\nLastly, my two biggest questions... Is a Rasp needed? I mean, sure, the Pi costs about $4 of electricity per year to be online 24/7. But if you could run the same off of say a PC with a network card, or say a laptop, you now have a feasible system that could find rapid adoption. A software update could be huge.\n\nBecause basically, what that would mean is that if you're the only guy with a 3g connection in the train that costs you $5 per gigabyte, and 10 people in the train desperately need to check their email, they can hook up their creditcard with Circle and log on to your wifi for $1 each and use 20mb. And it's something everyone could install on their PC, always on in the background (but only using your internet if you make money off of it), like skype or dropbox. Because I fear if you really need to buy a dedicated pi, no matter how cheap it is, it's still a big barrier to entry.\n\nAnd lastly, what's the legal framework? Not that you should care too much, you're just selling hardware. But I'd assume reselling your internet is probably illegal.\n\nGreat stuff once again, keeps us updated :)": 3, "Right, you could still offer assembled units and consulting for a premium, but since it's open source, you might as well offer a kit to get it into the hands of the community with little overhead on your part.": 2, "Thanks.

I\'ve thought about doing something similar to what you appear to be working on, though have not for lack of time.  My approach was going to be to use an OpenWRT capable router, many available in the $20-30 price range, install OpenWRT and then to modify either WifiDog or ChilliSpot to accept bitcoin.

It would be a shame to over-extend yourself just to have someone swipe your market out from underneath you with some quick mods to already stable and tested open source code.\n\nBy the way, I think the killer app here is if someone could integrate some self organizing meshing, and then include Tor by default.

Build a web portal into the hotspot landing page that promotes bitcoin and related businesses in the area of the hostpot.\n2. Offer free access to the internet and seek sponsors who are interested in front page advertising (coinbase et al spring to mind). \n3. You might consider speed/bandwidth rate limiting after a set period of time that can be upgraded to unlimited via a bitcoin payment and/or entry of a voucher code given at the PoS (if hotspot is in a retail outlet).
