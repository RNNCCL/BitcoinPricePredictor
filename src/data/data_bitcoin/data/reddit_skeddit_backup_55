The legal currency has limited practicality and probably only persists because of its legal status. Usually the US dollar becomes the de facto currency in states where the legal currency is impractical to use.\n\n>  I expect some use cases in bitcoin to come where mining cost is offset by utility\n\nSo the governments would be doing this - they get voting power at a cost, so there's no reason why big corporations couldn't do the same, but I figure they just defer that effort to the governments (which they strongly influence in some cases). That could come under the general pattern of shifting costs away from corporations to the taxpayer.\n\nAnother aspect is variations in the cost of energy. So if you're a solar farm in some relatively stable region of Africa, after you've installed the system the running costs are near zero, so you can mine regardless of the difficulty level.

Overall, **transaction fees are set based on market\nforces within the bitcoin network**. Miners prioritize transactions based on many different criteria, including fees, and might even process transactions for free under certain\ncircumstances. Transaction fees affect the processing priority, meaning that a transaction with sufficient fees is likely to be included in the next-most\xe2\x80\x93mined block, whereas\na transaction with insufficient or no fees might be delayed, processed on a best-effort\nbasis after a few blocks, or not processed at all. Transaction fees are not mandatory, and\ntransactions without fees might be processed eventually; however, including transaction\nfees encourages priority processing.\n\n\n> Over time, the way transaction fees are calculated and the effect they have on transaction\nprioritization has been evolving. At first, transaction fees were fixed and constant across\nthe network. Gradually, the fee structure has been relaxed so that it may be influenced\nby market forces, based on network capacity and transaction volume. **The current minimum transaction fee is fixed at 0.0001 bitcoin or a tenth of a milli-bitcoin per kilobyte**,\nrecently decreased from one milli-bitcoin. Most transactions are less than one kilobyte;\nhowever, those with multiple inputs or outputs can be larger. In future revisions of the\nbitcoin protocol, it is expected that wallet applications will use statistical analysis to\ncalculate the most appropriate fee to attach to a transaction based on the average fees\nof recent transactions.\n\n> Mastering Bitcoin - p 118-119\n\nI read chapter eight (again) as well.
