Is it possible to determine "computational units" ahead of actually verifying the tx? \n\nYes. [Jonas Nick](https://twitter.com/n1ckler) presented a [Validation Cost Metric](https://scalingbitcoin.org/hongkong2015/presentations/DAY2/3_tweaking_the_chain_3_nick.pdf) at Scaling Bitcoin HK that he developed with /u/maaku7, and /u/GibbsSamplePlatter. They developed a model to quantify the "cost" of validating a block. [Linear Regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression) was used to attain the coefficients for a "cost" function (factors in several attributes such as bytes hashed, num sig ops, etc). \n\nThe resulting model was quite accurate: the *absolute error* on testnet+mainnet was *4ms*. Additionally, this metric could be altered to factor in the effect of a transaction/block on the utxo set. It can be tweaked to reward blocks that reduce the size of the utxo set with a lower value from the cost function. Towards the end of the presentation Jonas proposed a consensus rule to reject blocks that had a cost(block) greater than some value "t". This can be used to develop a scheme for an adaptive block size based purely off of how costly blocks are to validate. \n\nedit: spelling': 10, "It's not clear why miners/users would both agree with this policy.

In fact, I\'d say it\'s a litmus test for where you come down on the issue of a hard fork now.\n\nIf you believe Bitcoin can/will displace credit cards, then you see the < 7 TPS transaction limit as a roadblock, and something that must be fixed - sooner rather than later.\n\nIf, on the other hand, you\'ve seen the failed experiments in which a merchant announces they\'re taking Bitcoin, only to find out they stopped 6-10 months later, then this kind of talk rings hollow and more than a little simplistic. For example:\n\nhttp://www.dailydot.com/politics/bitcoin-bowl-bitpay-one-year-later/\n\nSo using the "Bitcoin will replace credit cards" argument probably won\'t bring the community together in the way you think.\n\nBitcoin as a cross-border remittance system is a bit better.

In other words, money without government, and money outside the control of government.\n\nWhen you see this as "the front bowling pin," things start to look different. If this is the most compelling thing you can hire Bitcoin for, scaling bitcoin discussions take a back seat to issues of fungibility, censorship-resistance, privacy, and centralization. Indeed, the "one-time initialization time of starting up a new node" starts to look like a big deal, as does the ongoing, increasing cost of maintaining a full node.\n\nDiscussions around the block size limit have revealed deep disagreement about what Bitcoin is for.

It has already achieved that.  Whoopee.  It falls far short of its potential, much greater, utility.  If you think that this is where bitcoin stops (except maybe just grows more mainstream. . . somehow. . . despite the volatility and still unsolved user-error security issues), what on earth are you even excited about?

The question is do we wait 1 year, or do we carefully do a hard fork now (in the next 6 months) which is guaranteed to give us the breathing room we need? \n\nAs I understand it, SegWit itself won't prune down blocks without widespread implementation. A hard fork guarantees us 2x capacity, right now. I'm wary of rushing to deploy complicated SegWit code which forces software/hardware changes *across the board* in order to obtain relief from over-full blocks.": 2, 'Many core devs have a conflict of interest.

You cannot use Segwit to pay a merchant who has not upgraded, bcos he will not be able to generate a Segwit address. \n\nSo it is safer from the POV that nobody can lose money if they do not upgrade, whereas this is the total opposite in a hardfork.\n\nYes it is more complex to implement, but it is safer for the ecosystem.': 7, 'How about removing the limit altogether and having Bitcoin client developers put a **BIG FAT CLIENT WARNING: SIGNIFICANT CHANCE OF TRANSACTION FAILURE.

ARE YOU SURE?** if it exceeds 25 cents.\n\nAll transactions are valid. If we want to treat some as spam just because someone\'s trying to DDoS the network, there goes our fungibility and credibility. Under these rules, if someone tries to DDoS, they are going to pay for it, and we don\'t need to tune anything in a hard fork down the road. Miners could make a small fortune watching banks and governments spend themselves in to the ground trying to keep transactions too pricey for every day users. The miners would then be able to afford the fees to unload Bitcoin for $, should they choose to.\n\nFull node operators, now paying more to host this service, can charge for premium query access, or maybe it\'s just in their best interest to foot the bill (e.g. Maybe the FBI needs a full node to query against without being tracked, or Chase Bank needs to run a million queries against the blockchain, so they just host)\n\nTa-da!\n\nSome engineers don\'t think too far in to user behavior, and how important it is for a good experience and wide adoption.

Ultimately, this is going to result in one of two outcomes: 1. The network runs out of capacity artificially, and your transactions fail, or 2. The network runs out of real, physical capacity, and people go out and spend some money to upgrade the Bitcoin network, as I personally have already done, to fix this real, non-abstracted problem. We've seen how the latter plays out with mining/securing the network, and now we have a fucking petahash (18 zeroes, bitch. Just so you understand, that's 60 million hashes for **every star in the galaxy** every second of every day) supercomputer working for us 3 years after we started.

The only root problem we have right now is dwindling block chain capacity due to an artificial capacity limit. There's going to be another bubble in July due to the halvening. A new adoption wave will occur, this one might be the big one, and when people can't spend their newly purchased bitcoins because the network is broke, there's going to be a big, predictable crash at the end, followed by a ton of negative press that might end cryptocurrencies.

The url would likely be a dead give away. If you are using that as the discovery method seeing a url with bitcoin in it being hit constantly would be a pretty big giveaway\n\n2.

This is because for the other higher level applications (digital cash,  smart contracts, smart property, escrow, etc.) the base Bitcoin network (a distributed ledger with accounts and transferable balances) was necessary first.\n\nAs the first network and because Satoshi, like any other human, can\'t predict and pre-design everything to perfection, Bitcoin served as the first vision of electronic cash, but he didn\'t design correctly the programmability part so that network, by itself, has little chance to support the other applications he envisioned. \n\nThe above is why sidechains and Ehereum exist. Maybe Bitcoin itself could be evolved and redesigned to support programmability, but it seems very risky at this point considering that its asset BTC is worth $6 billion.\n\nThe above is why I think Bitcoin should be a global high value transfer of wealth system, but not a Visa competitor.\n\nBecause the innovation of Bitcoin is not cash (that was invented thousands of years ago) but the secure space for storage and transfer of ownership (which happens to be useful as cash as well), is why the **comparisons between "permissionless" vs "permissioned" networks is false**.

They announced they would never run anything except Core, period, end of story. This "requirement" had not been specified before.\n\nMy guess is that miners took a hint from the sliding price and dismissed XT in favor of Core to end the controversy. After that, the price drop indeed stopped and shortly after rallied from 250-300 to stabilize at over 400.\n\n> From both speaking to them personally (I have had various phone calls with miners around the world, including miners in China) and their public statments, they made it clear that their loyalty to Core was absolute and no matter what changes we made to XT, they would never run it. Thus compromising further was pointless.\n\nThis statement speaks for itself. Clearly, miners do not want controversy and want Core to take decisions. That makes all the sense in the world as controversy sinks the price of Bitcoin which in turns sinks their profit.\n\n> Why is Classic different? It wasn\'t, just one or two days ago. After I released my article, I was CCd on a private thread where KnC Miner published an "open letter" and suggested switching to Classic. The other miners shot him down immediately saying they wanted the change to come from Core.\n\nNote that miners shot down KnC on a *private* e-mail thread. So, other miners sticked to Core when KnC expressed their support for Classic.\n\n>Then the price started sliding, and they started reversing their positions.\n\nMike is suggesting here that the price started sliding because other miners did not support KnC in a *private* thread e-mail thread. How then would these sellers know about the position of other miners? Much more likely the price started sliding because of the *public* announcement by KnC.\n\n>Suddenly, Classic was acceptable whereas just hours before it had not been.\n\nMiners were adamantly opposed to Bitcoin XT and clearly expressed their support for Core regardless of what would be in XT. That is a loud and clear message: miners support the Core *dev team*.\n\nIt is hard to believe that in mere hours, miners attributed the price drop to their dismissal of Classic which they expressed in a *private* e-mail thread. It is even harder to believe that miners previously dismissing XT would suddenly support Classic.\n\nI am confident that miners will stay behind Core and I like to see Bitcoin Classic as a test to the soundness of the incentives of Bitcoin.
