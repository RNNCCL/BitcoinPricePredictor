No Credit! No Bank Account!</iv> to purchase ANYTHING online.\n\nThe digital economy has become an economic powerhouse with unprecedented growth and allowing for people with money but without banking services (or banking services that are neutered) to participate in it will allow this growth to continue to increase exponentially.\n\nBasically, Bitcoin as cash is a godsend for merchants because the demographic for their products just increased by orders of magnitude.\n\nEdit:  Of course, where we are today, it is nearly impossible for these unbanked people to obtain bitcoin due to them having to use exchanges to obtain it (AML & KYC) + bank transfers.  But when they start receiving it for services they perform (working in a factory, hooking, picking crops), they are ready to purchase anything they wish online.": 1, 'Blockchain technology is also changing the way trust is implemented on the internet.

Since credit card transactions are initiated by the recipient, and the recipient is directly given the only piece of information needed to initiate further transactions, every payment requires a great deal of trust.\n\nWith bitcoin, transactions are initiated by the sender, not the recipient. The publicly shared information cannot be used to initiate further transactions. The amount transferred cannot be tampered with. Each individual transaction requires little to no trust.\n\nThat said: Your funds are only as secure as you are personally.

Merchants and other people can check the balance of the wallet that you have or are about to use to pay them, but there\'s nothing they can do to take money out of your wallet or address. At most, they can send you a bill.\n\nBy swiping my debit card at Target, Home Depot and now Jimmy John\'s, it\'s any wonder I get any sleep at all at night. Yes, I\'m fully protected, but who wants to go through all that? If I had just bought some BTC and then used that BTC to buy gift cards at all of those establishments, I would have zero concern about my remaining balances. Even if those places accepted BTC directly, I would still have no concern because the system is designed to be safe when others have your public address.\n\nMoney always flows one way, based on the intention of the party sending the money. You list scams and wallet stealing malware as a con above. Please understand that all of that is outside of the realm of Bitcoin. That, like the credit card theft (and, oddly, the recent celebrity photo leaks) has entirely to do with the security of software wallets and poorly executed password and other safe computing practices by users.\n\nBy keeping all but the amount you intend to spend in the immediate future on paper and keeping only the amount you intend to spend in the immediate future on your phone or other Internet-connected device, no one will have access to your protected funds until you move them (or a portion) to a "less protected" device or system.\n\nScams only work when you don\'t recognize them as such and even then can only access funds stored in an online (aka "hot") wallet.\n\nNext, as has been covered in here a bunch of times, the transactions are instantaneous. It is very difficult for someone to immediately spend the same BTC twice, and it becomes exponentially more difficult as every 10 minute period goes by. When accepting BTC directly, it is up to the vendor to decide how long they\'re willing to wait before they consider a transaction permanently recorded. Some of us like to say, "if a coffee shop is waiting 10 minutes for a block to permanently record the transaction, they are doing it wrong". On the other hand, it is easily worth it to wait 10 minutes (or multiples of 10 minutes) when spending a bit more, such as buying a car or a house.\n\nFinally, it is important to note that Coinbase is already the most popular method for users in the US to buy, hold and spend BTC. They are also one of the top two payment processors in the US. When a transaction occurs between a Coinbase customer and merchant, that transaction occurs off the blockchain. It is instant and immediately permanent. The whole concept of trust increasing every 10 minutes goes away with this approach -- trust and transaction permanence reaches the maximum possible value instantly and stays there.\n\nAgain, the "10 minutes" discussion does not apply to transactions between customers using the most popular wallet in the US and one of the top two payment processors in the US. This, I think, is key and is a point lost on many, many people as evidenced by how frequently it comes up around here.': 21, "They'll be cheaper as traditional escrows because there will be much more competition.": 2, 'But you did just give all your personal information and credit card info to someone that is clearly not trustworthy.\n\nI think the trust factor applies to both CC and bitcoin payments.

Having a negative net worth and in debt is basically having no money\n\nI guess the point I'm making is that it if BTC cannot inflate, we would need to rely on different currencies or sources of value outside of BTC to accommodate that. If our financial system is broken, how could BTC potentially replace it?

We'll still have houses, chairs, computers, bananas, and all of those other actual things. Businesses, loans, stocks, bonds, etc. \n\nIf someone made a loan in bitcoin in a bitcoin-as-only-currency economy they're going to ask for an amount back later that's equivalent to their next best option. So if they would have bought an apple tree that earns them 1 apple a year with slightly more risk than the borrows risk of paying them back, they might ask the borrower for 1 apple a year as interest. \n\nI'm using apples to illustrate the return in a tangible way that is not currency. In this example, assume the apple will have the same value compared to other resources in the future.\n\nThey denominate the loan in bitcoin, because no one wants to be paid back in apples. Now, we get to the interest rate, which is NOT arbitrary. If all of the bitcoin has been mined, and the world economy is productive, bitcoin will probably be DEFLATIONARY. Since you only have 21 mil. BTC chasing a growing amount of goods, it will probably take less BTC to buy a fixed amount of goods each year.\n\nFor this example lets say that the price of 1 Apple in:\n\nYear 1 = 100mbtc\nYear 2 = 90mbtc\nYear 3 = 80mbtc\nYear 4 = 70mbtc\nyear 5 = 60mbtc\n\nLikewise, let's say that the value of 1 Apple tree was 10 BTC in year 1 and will be 6 BTC in year 5 because of deflation. \n\nThe lender, who is making the loan instead of buying an apple tree, will need only to pay back the value of the 5 apples (100+90+80+70+60=400 mbtc) and the value of the apple tree (which is now 6btc) in order to be equally happy with the apple tree or the loan.* So he will give the borrower 10btc in year 1, and receive 6.4 btc back in year 5 and be *equally well off*. \n\nWhere does the rest of the bitcoin go? The short answer is that it is chasing around more goods. Its being used by the people the borrower spent the money on to buy things, and since there are more things that they are able to afford, they need to divide up their BTC into smaller pieces to buy those tings.\n\n*For simplicity, we're pretending he won't reinvest the apples from the tree.

Which means that there is a lot more that is different than just price-per-transaction.\n\nI would agree that the discount is not happening, but frankly its not the interesting reason for people to want to use Bitcoin anyway.\n\nThe main reason why Bitcoin is so cool is because it is not managed by anyone.  I choose the word "managed" on purpose because FIAT is being managed. The people that run the central banks are pretty smart people and they have been managing the economy for various decades.\n\nUnfortunately the way they have been managing the economy is by removing unstabilities.

A lot of the fees of handling cash go away with Bitcoin.': 3, "Both services & products must go cheaper. If all the economy products are cheaper, the customers can afford purchasing more. When you're dumping the prices, you're dominating the market. Some of your competitors will want to cut your head for lowering prices.\n\nDon't be greedy. Most remote workers are ready to have some stable payments even if that will mean doing some cheaper jobs, or some stable online jobs, but this stability rarely provided in any free-lance market. If you give everyone a stability in free-lance market, probably then there will be more people who's willing to work for cheaper rates at your freelance marketplace. Everybody sets fixed prices at the freelance markets - nobody among workers want to make a discount, because they know there's not a lots of jobs available & half of their time will be spent to search free-lance jobs, and part of that time/money will be spent to inefficient means of money transferring for their job + freelance board commission. If you would remove all of such obstacles, then there wouldn't be such problems. And that's about freelancing.\n\nNow let's talk about products.\n\nYeah this sounds very abstract. But Bitcoin is all about costs. 1) Cheaper costs of running Bitcoin network; 2) Cost of producing goods (doesn't matter real or virtual); 3) Replacing the whole systems & logistics with Bitcoin oriented economical optimizing\n\nMany businesses in the world are employing the business model 1 to 10% expenditures for raw material, 80% for management - that gives you that price tags like $100, $1000 and such product prices. There's so many things in such categories which could cost cheaper, but due to market sizes/high management costs they can't be make cheaper, even though customers wouldn't mind pay cheaper!\n\nI mean that all operational expenses could be cut. Entrepreneurship is being keen/flexible enough to provide competitive prices. E.g. before Internet servers wasn't popular everybody thought that normal shared web-hosting will cost at least $10 per month or bigger, but once we found out that quality of computers are growing, we don't feel like to pay for shared web-hosting at all. We can get the same quality of prices for $1.\n\nThe same revolution is have to be made about everything: current herbalife protein power costs around $40, original viagra costs $20. I have some strong belief that I should be able to order both of those things in the form of generic stuff, and I think this is a wonderful thing. Imagine yourself ordering some generic Indian herbalife for $3 (delivery included). Without Bitcoin & without OpenBazaar such things seemed impossible. With Bitcoin - it is obvious.\n\nThere's nothing wrong with decreasing the prices. All of those who's saying that you have to make your time cost more money, and that's correct thought. But that doesn't mean that you're always have to increase your prices. Make product massive, dominate on low-price markets!\n\nIf at Bitcoin shops we provide cheaper prices but only for Bitcoin customers that could be decisive factor for Bitcoin adoption speed.\n\n\n\nSo don't be greedy, and start making customers loyal to your business, offer them discounts, but only if they're transacting in Bitcoin. In my opinion world can become better place if we follow this patterns. I think its time to fight monopolies.
