It can be used as a medium of exchange, that is we can pass gold back and forth fairly easily when carrying out a transaction, we can use its mass as unit of account and that unit is fairly consistent, it can be used as a store of value so that possession of gold preserves ones purchasing power over an extended period of time rather than eroding, and finally it is difficult to forge or reproduce, so that possession of gold is mostly attained by producing goods and services.\n\nAs for your remark about jewelry, gold isn't valuable because of its use in jewelry.
