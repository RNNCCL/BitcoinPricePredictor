But that doesn't mean all, or even a majority, of wealth discrepancy is illegitimate. ": 8, 'Ironically, this limited definition of "anarchism" ensures that "anarcho"-capitalism is inherently self-refuting. This can be seen from leading "anarcho"-capitalist Murray Rothbard. He thundered against the evil of the state, arguing that it "arrogates to itself a monopoly of force, of ultimate decision-making power, over a given territorial area." In and of itself, this definition is unremarkable. That a few people (an elite of rulers) claim the right to rule others must be part of any sensible definition of the state or government. However, the problems begin for Rothbard when he notes that "[o]bviously, in a free society, Smith has the ultimate decision-making power over his own just property, Jones over his, etc." [The Ethics of Liberty, p. 170 and p. 173] The logical contradiction in this position should be obvious, but not to Rothbard. It shows the power of ideology, the ability of mere words (the expression "private property") to turn the bad ("ultimate decision-making power over a given area") into the good ("ultimate decision-making power over a given area").\n\nNow, this contradiction can be solved in only one way -- the users of the "given area" are also its owners. In other words, a system of possession (or "occupancy and use") as favoured by anarchists. However, Rothbard is a capitalist and supports private property, non-labour income, wage labour, capitalists and landlords. This means that he supports a divergence between ownership and use and this means that this "ultimate decision-making power" extends to those who use, but do not own, such property (i.e. tenants and workers). The statist nature of private property is clearly indicated by Rothbard\'s words -- the property owner in an "anarcho"-capitalist society possesses the "ultimate decision-making power" over a given area, which is also what the state has currently. Rothbard has, ironically, proved by his own definition that "anarcho"-capitalism is not anarchist.\n\nOf course, it would be churlish to point out that the usual name for a political system in which the owner of a territory is also its ruler is, in fact, monarchy. Which suggests that while "anarcho"-capitalism may be called "anarcho-statism" a far better term could be "anarcho-monarchism." In fact, some "anarcho"-capitalists have made explicit this obvious implication of Rothbard\'s argument. Hans-Hermann Hoppe is one.\n\nHoppe prefers monarchy to democracy, considering it the superior system. He argues that the monarch is the private owner of the government -- all the land and other resources are owned by him. Basing himself on Austrian economics (what else?) and its notion of time preference, he concludes that the monarch will, therefore, work to maximise both current income and the total capital value of his estate. Assuming self-interest, his planning horizon will be farsighted and exploitation be far more limited. Democracy, in contrast, is a publicly-owned government and the elected rulers have use of resources for a short period only and not their capital value. In other words, they do not own the country and so will seek to maximise their short-term interests (and the interests of those they think will elect them into office). In contrast, Bakunin stressed that if anarchism rejects democracy it was "hardly in order to reverse it but rather to advance it," in particular to extend it via "the great economic revolution without which every right is but an empty phrase and a trick." He rejected wholeheartedly "the camp of aristocratic . . . reaction." [The Basic Bakunin, p. 87]\n\nHowever, Hoppe is not a traditional monarchist. His ideal system is one of competing monarchies, a society which is led by a "voluntarily acknowledged \'natural\' elite -- a nobilitas naturalis" comprised of "families with long-established records of superior achievement, farsightedness, and exemplary personal conduct." This is because "a few individuals quickly acquire the status of an elite" and their inherent qualities will "more likely than not [be] passed on within a few -- noble -- families." The sole "problem" with traditional monarchies was "with monopoly, not with elites or nobility," in other words the King monopolised the role of judge and their subjects could not turn to other members of the noble class for services. ["The Political Economy of Monarchy and Democracy and the Idea of a Natural Order," pp. 94-121, Journal of Libertarian Studies, vol. 11, no. 2, p. 118 and p. 119]\n\nWhich simply confirms the anarchist critique of "anarcho"-capitalism, namely that it is not anarchist. This becomes even more obvious when Hoppe helpfully expands on the reality of "anarcho"-capitalism:\n\n \n\n"In a covenant concluded among proprietor and community tenants for the purpose of protecting their private property, no such thing as a right to free (unlimited) speech exists, not even to unlimited speech on one\'s own tenant-property. One may say innumerable things and promote almost any idea under the sun, but naturally no one is permitted to advocate ideas contrary to the very purpose of the covenant of preserving private property, such as democracy and communism. There can be no tolerance towards democrats and communists in a libertarian social order. They will have to be physically separated and expelled from society. Likewise in a covenant founded for the purpose of protecting family and kin, there can be no tolerance toward those habitually promoting lifestyles incompatible with this goal. They -- the advocates of alternative, non-family and kin-centred lifestyles such as, for instance, individual hedonism, parasitism, nature-environment worship, homosexuality, or communism -- will have to be physically removed from society, too, if one is to maintain a libertarian order." [Democracy: the God that Failed, p. 218]\n\nThus the proprietor has power/authority over his tenants and can decree what they can and cannot do, excluding anyone whom they consider as being subversive (in the tenants\' own interests, of course). In other words, the autocratic powers of the boss are extended into all aspects of society -- all under the mask of advocating liberty. Sadly, the preservation of property rights destroys liberty for the many (Hoppe states clearly that for the "anarcho"-capitalist the "natural outcome of the voluntary transactions between various private property owners is decidedly non-egalitarian, hierarchical and elitist." ["The Political Economy of Monarchy and Democracy and the Idea of a Natural Order," Op. Cit., p. 118]). Unsurprisingly, Chomsky argued that right-wing "libertarianism" has "no objection to tyranny as long as it is private tyranny." In fact it (like other contemporary ideologies) "reduce[s] to advocacy of one or another form of illegitimate authority, quite often real tyranny." [Chomsky on Anarchism, p. 235 and p. 181] As such, it is hard not to conclude that "anarcho"-capitalism is little more than a play with words. It is not anarchism but a cleverly designed and worded surrogate for elitist, autocratic conservatism. Nor is too difficult to conclude that genuine anarchists and libertarians (of all types) would not be tolerated in this so-called "libertarian social order."\n\n': 0, 'I didn\'t, but the UN does.

As dictionaries are rarely politically sophisticated things, this means that they fail to recognise that anarchism is more than just opposition to government, it is also marked a opposition to capitalism (i.e. exploitation and private property). Thus, opposition to government is a necessary but not sufficient condition for being an anarchist -- you also need to be opposed to exploitation and capitalist private property. As "anarcho"-capitalists do not consider interest, rent and profits (i.e. capitalism) to be exploitative nor oppose capitalist property rights, they are not anarchists.\n\nPart of the problem is that Marxists, like many academics, also tend to assert that anarchists are simply against the state. It is significant that both Marxists and "anarcho"-capitalists tend to define anarchism as purely opposition to government. This is no co-incidence, as both seek to exclude anarchism from its place in the wider socialist movement. This makes perfect sense from the Marxist perspective as it allows them to present their ideology as the only serious anti-capitalist one around (not to mention associating anarchism with "anarcho"-capitalism is an excellent way of discrediting our ideas in the wider radical movement). It should go without saying that this is an obvious and serious misrepresentation of the anarchist position as even a superficial glance at anarchist theory and history shows that no anarchist limited their critique of society simply at the state. So while academics and Marxists seem aware of the anarchist opposition to the state, they usually fail to grasp the anarchist critique applies to all other authoritarian social institutions and how it fits into the overall anarchist analysis and struggle. They seem to think the anarchist condemnation of capitalist private property, patriarchy and so forth are somehow superfluous additions rather than a logical position which reflects the core of anarchism:\n\n \n\n"Critics have sometimes contended that anarchist thought, and classical anarchist theory in particular, has emphasised opposition to the state to the point of neglecting the real hegemony of economic power. This interpretation arises, perhaps, from a simplistic and overdrawn distinction between the anarchist focus on political domination and the Marxist focus on economic exploitation . . . there is abundant evidence against such a thesis throughout the history of anarchist thought." [John P. Clark and Camille Martin, Anarchy, Geography, Modernity, p. 95]\n\nSo Reclus simply stated the obvious when he wrote that "the anti-authoritarian critique to which the state is subjected applies equally to all social institutions." [quoted by Clark and Martin, Op. Cit., p. 140] Proudhon, Bakunin, Kropotkin, Goldman and so on would all agree with that. While they all stressed that anarchism was against the state they quickly moved on to present a critique of private property and other forms of hierarchical authority. So while anarchism obviously opposes the state, "sophisticated and developed anarchist theory proceeds further. It does not stop with a criticism of political organisation, but goes on to investigate the authoritarian nature of economic inequality and private property, hierarchical economic structures, traditional education, the patriarchal family, class and racial discrimination, and rigid sex- and age-roles, to mention just a few of the more important topics." For the "essence of anarchism is, after all, not the theoretical opposition to the state, but the practical and theoretical struggle against domination." [John Clark, The Anarchist Moment, p. 128 and p. 70]\n\nThis is also the case with individualist anarchists whose defence of certain forms of property did stop them criticising key aspects of capitalist property rights. As Jeremy Jennings notes, the "point to stress is that all anarchists, and not only those wedded to the predominant twentieth-century strain of anarchist communism have been critical of private property to the extent that it was a source of hierarchy and privilege." He goes on to state that anarchists like Tucker and Spooner "agreed with the proposition that property was legitimate only insofar as it embraced no more than the total product of individual labour." ["Anarchism", Contemporary Political Ideologies, Roger Eatwell and Anthony Wright (eds.), p. 132] This is acknowledged by the likes of Rothbard who had to explicitly point how that his position on such subjects was fundamentally different (i.e., at odds) with individualist anarchism.\n\nAs such, it would be fair to say that most "anarcho"-capitalists are capitalists first and foremost. If aspects of anarchism do not fit with some element of capitalism, they will reject that element of anarchism rather than question capitalism (Rothbard\'s selective appropriation of the individualist anarchist tradition is the most obvious example of this). This means that right-"libertarians" attach the "anarcho" prefix to their ideology because they believe that being against government intervention is equivalent to being an anarchist (which flows into their use of the dictionary definition of anarchism). That they ignore the bulk of the anarchist tradition should prove that there is hardly anything anarchistic about them at all. They are not against authority, hierarchy or the state -- they simply want to privatise them.\n\n': -2}, ('Bitcoin Network Status Update Thursday, October 01, 2015', 0): {}, ('CCN is closing shop?', 19): {'It was a joke': 1, 'Even though this article is old, good riddance.': -2, 'From what I understand his goal was always to sell.

However, **pure proof of stake approaches\npose substantial security threats** that cannot be recreated in proof of work systems (including Bitcoin).\nThese problems are inherent to proof of stake algorithms, as **proof of stake consensus is not anchored\nin the physical world** (cf. with hashing equipment in proof of work).\n\n> That is why virtually all of currencies relying on proof of stake use additional mechanisms to address\nsecurity issues. For example, the initial distribution problem can be solved by using a timeconstrained\nversion of proof of work; double-spend attacks can be prevented by including information\nabout recent blocks into transactions. Still, these improvements can be seen as ad-hoc and incomplete.\nUnlike proof of work, proof of stake consensus is not objective; the state of a PoS system cannot be reliably\ndetermined by new users based solely on protocol rules and a list of blocks and other network\nmessages obtained from peers. In order to prevent long range forks of the blockchain, a proof of stake\nsystem needs to implement weak subjectivity by combining protocol rules with social-driven security.\nThe social component of PoS systems weakens their decentralization and mathematical soundness.\nAs Vitalik Buterin puts it [20], \xe2\x80\x9c[A]ll \xe2\x80\x9cpure\xe2\x80\x9d proof-of-stake systems are ultimately permanent nobilities\nwhere **the members of the genesis block allocation always have the ultimate say.

While these systems solve several\nmajor problems with the straightforward PoS implementations, they are not yet widespread, making\nit difficult to evaluate their security.

Consolidation outweighs single point of failure.

I think you're correct on this point, but there is a tradeoff.

Since him, the protocol has continued evolving (and has further to go yet) via consensus amongst a collective of very intelligent individuals acting with selfless foresight.  At some point in time, however, the beast must be unleashed; Bitcoin's ruleset should become immutable such that it is impervious to any manipulation through social constructs/conventions (such as democracy).\n\nAgain, that's just one person's idealistic view.

See the spring 2013 event beginning with block 225430.\n\nLess obvious but more concerning would be the opportunity to break the current community-consensus requirement on the adjustment of Bitcoin\'s rules, and generally make hard-forks of the protocol much easier.

Imagine what happens when Keynesian economists become the majority of bitcoin users and they decide to \'vote\' on a change to the fixed 21M coin supply limit?\n\nOkay okay, my wild speculations and future predictions aside, can you elaborate more on what dangers you think exist for a monolithic codebase?  What problems do you see befalling bitcoin if every full-node is running the same code?\n\n**edit:**\n\nI should more carefully separate two components of my view:\n\n1. Pragmatically speaking, it is difficult to ensure perfect equivalence between multiple independent implementations of a specification.  A single codebase is the safest way to fully and precisely define all details of the consensus building rules.  (It would be further ideal if the code was always built in the same environment with the same tools, and run in identical virtual machines.)\n\n2. More theoretical is a concern about what happens to the governance structure when there are multiple independent implementations of the specification.  Any hard-fork changes actually affect the specification itself, and should be discussed amongst the entire community, but we\'ll have created a means for independent bitcoin implementations to subversively inject the changes they want into their code and let a \'free market\' (i.e. democracy of users) decide what gets run.': -1, "In my opinion, it is important that we work towards multiple (forkwise-compatible) implementations of the protocol. The 90% node share that Core presently has is a danger to Bitcoin's future development.": 19, "> It isn't with a fully encompassing libconsensus; it'd be running off the same engine.\n\nI disagree.  I'm not sure how libconsensus will work exactly, but when I compile the same code with even different versions of the same compiler, it can result in differences in the HEX file (most my C/C++ experience is related to microcontrollers; the HEX file is the machine code for the program).  Furthermore, future processors could have unknown errata that result in slightly different behaviour in rare edge cases.  For example, a few years ago my team spent several weeks tracking down an issue where two different revisions of the same part-numbered microcontroller behaved differently when programmed with the same HEX file (due to what we later learned was an not-yet-known erratum for the chip).  \n\nMy point is that when you're dealing with the real world, you can never really predict the outcome of an event with 100% certainty.
