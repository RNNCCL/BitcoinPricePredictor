For example, imagine you had to deposit $300 worth of BTC into a special open source client side Bitcoin wallet to get access to zero fee instant transactions over Lightning. Is that really so bad? Do you *really* need fees to be zero on the main blockchain? Or do you just need to preserve the ability to make *some* transactions with zero fee? Because if so those transactions can certainly occur over Lightning.": -5, 'Once Bitcoin has Lightning, BBQCoin will too. That doesn\'t mean BBQCoin will gain a followingfor its "low fees" and "high throughput".\n\nFor example, go hold a hypervolatile illiquid altcoin like BBQCoin starting today. In a few weeks after losing your money in the markets you can explain why liquidity and network effect aren\'t critical features to money. It sure is amazing when your investments hold their value, hey it\'s almost as if that\'s an explicit goal for most investors. Not to lose your ass in the markets is quite a bit more important than BBQCoin\'s low fees and throughput.': 0, 'Actually one of the biggest advantages of bitcoin is its decentralisation. If it were possible for a government or group of governments to control the major miners and hashing power they could basically destroy the entire system by forcing KYC, forcing people to have licences to approve transactions, banning certain types of transactions etc. This could slow down the whole system and remove the permissionless innovation aspect which actually makes it useful. It would slowly become only as good as a less efficient version of a server based system (but at least more transparent.)': 4, '> the long term technological trends stop immediately.\n\nActually, the technical community at large isn\'t worried about trends *stopping* - we\'re worried the trends will stay on course which is what need to happen just to keep full nodes reasonable to run on home PCs. This at admittedly *ultra-low* block sizes, let alone block sizes potentially 8000% higher.\n\n> There will be plenty of time to adjust if it happens (and the soft fork can be rolled out really fast in case of emergency).\n\nDeforestation takes time. Is there ever a true emergency in the Amazon? According to whom? And really - once consensus is made up that there is indeed a problem - what can actually be done? Especially with the blockchain bloat, you can\'t reverse it - *ever*. Bloat is permanent and we\'ll always deal with it forever.\n\nAnd when it comes down to it, you\'re trusting the core team to bail you out of an emergency - whether that be a hard fork up, or a soft fork down. Hearn was correct to complain about both types of forks because in a sense both forks *do* require core consensus. Then why be aggressive with blocks? The market for cryptocurrencies - e.g. Ripple\'s market cap vs. Bitcoin\'s market cap - clearly demonstrates the market appreciates decentralization more than throughput.\n\nTechnology "allows" for much interesting stuff - as long as you\'re willing to sacrifice nodes to datacenters where the user experience of running a node on home PC takes a backseat to the demands of non-node running users. Unfortunately, Bitcoin will quickly shed nodes losing untold amounts of its decentralizing qualities under even the most conservative of increases. For example, the #1 reason given for not running a full node today is blockchain size woes. By further bloating the chain before we\'ve even had a chance to recover node users on desktop, you\'re essentially condemning nodes to datacenters for who knows how long.\n\n> If you earned $300 per year you wouldn\'t say that.\n\nI\'m not willing to entertain your notion that impoverished people are life and death serious for widescale Bitcoin adoption. I feel bad about it in fact, but it\'s true. What we need are for rich people to invest a ton of money right now into Bitcoin, and improving throughput doesn\'t actually help with that - well-capitalized, long term Bitcoin investors simply don\'t need fees to be $0 given how infrequently coins need to be moved. And when payments *do* actually need to be made, what\'s so bad about pushing a button to use LightningVenmo?': -2, 'If the TOR developers only allowed a few messages per day per person would you still use TOR?

If you look at [Satoshi\'s quotes](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=532.msg6306#msg6306), Satoshi was for increasing the blocksize over time, which does sacrifice node decentralization a bit, but increases decentralization in other ways like by allowing masses of new users which solidifies and secures the whole system.  How do Trace and Erik feel about the current deadlock of the debate for increasing blocksize?  Also do they feel that if the blocksize is not increased that it would be breaking the social contract made between Satoshi and Bitcoin investors?  As an early investor I feel it does break that contract.\n\n> 2.  Also what do they think will happen in the next weeks and months when the [number of transactions per day](https://blockchain.info/charts/n-transactions) reaches an all time high filling blocks?  We have only before seen full blocks due to stress testing and never due to natural growth.  Are they worried it could cause problems on the network?  If it does cause problems do they think a blocksize increase will be made shortly after?\n\n> 3. Also I would like to know their opinion on having different reference implementations like instead of Bitcoin Core, we also have Bitcoin XT, and Bitcoin Unlimited, custom patched versions of Core, etc... Doesn\'t fragmentation of implementations and competition increase decentralization and isn\'t that a healthy thing?\n\n> 4. Also I am interested their views on the censorship of the debate in certain subreddits and forums, and if that is healthy or unhealthy.  I think its unhealthy.\n\n> 5. According to [Peter__R\'s recent comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/3xaexf/in_case_anyone_missed_it_peter_r_hit_the_nail_on/), he says the blocksize debate is controversial because the choice is binary.  There is either fee pressure due to mostly full blocks or not.  In which camp do each Erik and Trace reside?  If they reside in the camp that wants fee pressure, how do they reconcile that since it seems to oppose Satoshi\'s original views?\n\n> 6. What do they think about Jeff Garzik who recently states on the mailing list that  ["If block size stays at 1M, the Bitcoin Core developer team should sign a collective note stating their desire to transition to a new economic policy, that of "healthy fee market" and strongly urge users to examine their fee policies, wallet software, transaction volumes and other possible User impacting outcomes."](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2015-December/011973.html)? It seems Jeff believes they are breaking that social contract that Satoshi made as well.\n\nThat is all I guess.  I probably have more, but I am really worried about this blocksize issue and its front and center right now, and an urgent matter.

Prices will be quoted not in dollars, yen or D-marks but in, let\xe2\x80\x99s say, the phoenix. The phoenix will be favoured by companies and shoppers because it will be more convenient than today\xe2\x80\x99s national currencies, which by then will seem a quaint cause of much disruption to economic life in the last twentieth century.    \n> \xe2\x80\x93    \n> At the beginning of 1988 this appears an outlandish prediction. Proposals for eventual monetary union proliferated five and ten years ago, but they hardly envisaged the setbacks of 1987. The governments of the big economies tried to move an inch or two towards a more managed system of exchange rates \xe2\x80\x93 a logical preliminary, it might seem, to radical monetary reform. For lack of co-operation in their underlying economic policies they bungled it horribly, and provoked the rise in interest rates that brought on the stock market crash of October. These events have chastened exchange-rate reformers. The market crash taught them that the pretence of policy co-operation can be worse than nothing, and that until real co-operation is feasible (i.e., until governments surrender some economic sovereignty) further attempts to peg currencies will flounder.    \n> \xe2\x80\xa6    \n> The new world economy    \n> The biggest change in the world economy since the early 1970\xe2\x80\x99s is that flows of money have replaced trade in goods as the force that drives exchange rates. as a result of the relentless integration of the world\xe2\x80\x99s financial markets, differences in national economic policies can disturb interest rates (or expectations of future interest rates) only slightly, yet still call forth huge transfers of financial assets from one country to another. These transfers swamp the flow of trade revenues in their effect on the demand and supply for different currencies, and hence in their effect on exchange rates. As telecommunications technology continues to advance, these transactions will be cheaper and faster still. With unco-ordinated economic policies, currencies can get only more volatile.    \n> \xe2\x80\xa6.    \n> In all these ways national economic boundaries are slowly dissolving. As the trend continues, the appeal of a currency union across at least the main industrial countries will seem irresistible to everybody except foreign-exchange traders and governments. In the phoenix zone, economic adjustment to shifts in relative prices would happen smoothly and automatically, rather as it does today between different regions within large economies (a brief on pages 74-75 explains how.) The absence of all currency risk would spur trade, investment and employment.    \n> \xe2\x80\x93    \n> The phoenix zone would impose tight constraints on national governments. There would be no such thing, for instance, as a national monetary policy. The world phoenix supply would be fixed by a new central bank, descended perhaps from the IMF. The world inflation rate \xe2\x80\x93 and hence, within narrow margins, each national inflation rate- would be in its charge. Each country could use taxes and public spending to offset temporary falls in demand, but it would have to borrow rather than print money to finance its budget deficit. With no recourse to the inflation tax, governments and their creditors would be forced to judge their borrowing and lending plans more carefully than they do today. This means a big loss of economic sovereignty, but the trends that make the phoenix so appealing are taking that sovereignty away in any case. Even in a world of more-or-less floating exchange rates, individual governments have seen their policy independence checked by an unfriendly outside world.    \n> \xe2\x80\x93    \n> As the next century approaches, the natural forces that are pushing the world towards economic integration will offer governments a broad choice. They can go with the flow, or they can build barricades. Preparing the way for the phoenix will mean fewer pretended agreements on policy and more real ones. It will mean allowing and then actively promoting the private-sector use of an international money alongside existing national monies. That would let people vote with their wallets for the eventual move to full currency union. The phoenix would probably start as a cocktail of national currencies, just as the Special Drawing Right is today. In time, though, its value against national currencies would cease to matter, because people would choose it for its convenience and the stability of its purchasing power.    \n> \xe2\x80\xa6    \n> The alternative \xe2\x80\x93 to preserve policymaking autonomy- would involve a new proliferation of truly draconian controls on trade and capital flows. This course offers governments a splendid time. They could manage exchange-rate movements, deploy monetary and fiscal policy without inhibition, and tackle the resulting bursts of inflation with prices and incomes polices.

So now we are getting somewhere.  \n\nFree markets is a term we agree on. We also agree on fascism.  \n\nWhere we disagree is in equating free markets with the term capitalism.  Free markets can indeed lead to concentrations of power and money.  In money, a free market might indeed lead to a situation of intense concentration of capital such that capital markets are oligarchal. This situation can not truly be called a free market.  Marx and others coined the term capitalist as a criticism of cartelization of money. His solution was cartelization of labour.  \n\nThe original poster here makes a similar logical mistake.  Our financial world is not free market in any sense.  Not only is it oligarchal, the oligarchy is a state joint venture (ie central banks and regulated commercial banks). Money, today, is definitively fascism.  It is also capitalistic, ie concentrated power of capital.  Thus using the term capitalism interchangeably with free markets is a confusion of usage of language. Yes free markets can lead to cartelism. In money, this cartelism is capitalism. But capitalism can also arise from cartelization by state intervention in money.  \n\nIn neither case of capitalism should things be considered free market.   So free markets and capitalism are very distinctly different things. \n\nThe solution is not more state intervention.  The solution is to maintain freedom.  Cartels do not exist long without state support. The advantages cartels create for themselves brings new competition. \n\nThat's why we must distinguish between capitalism and free markets.  We already have capitalism, oligarchal control of money, state sponsored central and chartered credit banks.  We do not have free markets.  \n\nThis confusion of language leads OP to a 180 degree incorrect solution. We do not require further socialization of capital. Exactly the opposite is required. \n\nIf we really used the term capitalism correctly, that is a concentrated control of capital, the debate would be more productive.  As it stands we get a false choice, social control of all capital (really communism) vs big banks capitalism by state sponsor (really fascism). \n\nBig banks must be allowed to fail.

Go here to read my final statement I made about the Bitcoin Foundation. http://bitcoinfoundation.org/forum/index.php?/topic/1366-board-seat-appointments/#entry14451\n-\nI pasted it here for your convenience:\n-\nLadies and Gentlemen, this is how freedom dies.\n-\nThe first thing I told everyone after I was removed from the board, was that they should not expect any elections anymore. I fully anticipated a final power grab to take place. It seems my prediction came true. The excuse that elections take a lot of time and money, is obviously a convenient lie. You have (or had), plenty of volunteers to do that.\n-\nThe real reason behind this whole charade? On december 31st 2015, 2 board members would have ended their term. At that point, it would have been a 4 member board (In essence: Jim and myself, vs Brock and Bobby). This would have produced a change of power dynamics, and at a minimum would require consensus instead of a 4 vs 2 situation. Behold, it might have finally broken the old boys club\'s power!\n-\nPlanned or not, the fact that I was removed from the board for a sham reason, resulted in destroying whatever credibility the Foundation had left. Noone in their right mind would join a board that removes members, unless gravely warranted. A faith that not even Mark Karpeles suffered, after he performed possibly the biggest crime/theft in Bitcoin\'s history. Need I say more? Posted Image\n-\nAnyone joining the board at this point (elected or not), will merely be a puppet.\n-\nBruce, I am also disappointed in you, for creating a rhetoric that it was the Boards fault, and that nothing has happened because of infighting. I think you have gotten all the liberty to execute whatever you saw fit over the last year. I also think it is inappropriate to insinuate I was actively going against the Foundation. You know all too well, that I went out of your way so you could succeed, even if I had my doubts that the Foundation\'s reputation could ever be restored. If anyone ever wants to verify that, you can read the minutes from the last 6-9 months, which outlines all the board meetings we had.\n-\nBruce, I\'m asking you to wake up. The board just turned a member ran(!) organization into a dictatorship. I\'m sure you think Brock and Bobby are doing the right thing, but at this point it is all about ego and abusing whatever power the Foundation\'s name has left. You should not take part in this, I know you are a good person. The members haven\'t paid for this charade. If you have any honour, you would give them their money back. I will even help you to pay for it (individual members).\n-\nTo the members: The board apparently measures "member satisfaction", by counting how many members actively resign. (you\'d think they\'d measure the amount of new signups instead). My reply to the board was that probably noone even bothers to send that letter anymore.\n-\nStill, out of principle, and as my final act, I hereby resign my lifetime membership to the Bitcoin Foundation. Don\'t bother with having me send a letter, that\'s just a hoop you put in place to make it more difficult. This post will also be the last thing I ever have to say about the Foundation, because honestly, I think everything has been said (and I mean that in the broadest way possible).\n-\nLet the curtain fall.\n-\nGood night, and good luck.\n-\nOlivier': 9, '> the fully 100% member elected board\n\nOut of curiosity, which of the members of the current board were elected by class (c) Individual Members?': 3, "While you're 100% correct, you're not going to be taken seriously if you're a dick about it.": 1, "No need to disband it, it's out of funds and will whither and die on its own!": 1, 'It was prior to your arrival as E.D., Bruce, but there was [some effort at putting together a plan](http://bitcoinfoundation.org/forum/index.php?/topic/1286-strategic-proposal/#entry13814).

Jim voluntarily stepped down because he didn\'t think the organization should exist.  \n\nThe remaining board members voted off Olivier in a 4/1 vote because they felt it was impossible to reconcile a member who seeks destruction of an organization with those who want it to survive (and who feel that their best representation of members is to keep it operating) they tried for 5-6 months to get him to propose any alternative....he never did.

We have hundreds of people in chapters across the world who feel this organization should exist.\n\nWho is Andreas to decree something that is against the majority of the fully member elected board?

Most are probably too lazy to answers because with this level of curiosity you probably could be better off just reading something longer and learning how it all works in detail. Anyway, let me try:\n\n1) Good worry. Private key is stored by your wallet. In many wallets it's stored in encrypted form and only end up decrypted in memory after you provide some kind of passphrase. If we are talking e.g. about android, other apps cannot access wallet app data (unless there's something broken). In case of desktop e.g. windows if your computer is compromised then your bitcoins may be stolen (see later answer)\n\nAnd yes, stealing means sending them to some other address (to which you don't have private key)\n\n2) There are may kind of bitcoin ATMs, giving bitcoins or cash. If you get cash for bitcoins it's safe because you just send bitcoins to specific address (well it could not give you cash after that, but the rest of your funds are safe). If you pay with cash similar thing, and with CC in theory somebody could steal your credit card details. There are a few common brands of bitcoin ATMs though and usually they are not in public but inside some bar/shop so it's hard for somebody to mess with them.\n\n3) Yes the information about your bitcoins is stored on every computer running a full node. Your wallet will show it if you provide the address, but to spend them you need your private key (in some wallet it may be called a seed, this list of  words is converted to your private key)\n\n4) That is a problem, because it's hard to be sure about your machine security. That's why hardware wallets were invented (e.g. trezor). Private keys don't touch your online device then and are stored on the hardware wallet. Hardware wallet takes care of signing transactions and making sure they send what you wanted to send.\n\n5) It is.

There is a \xe2\x80\x9cdimension paradox\xe2\x80\x9d: Agricultural products are produced by using the two-dimensional resource of the earth surface, so the \xe2\x80\x9cdisappearing frontier\xe2\x80\x9d creates a limitation. In contrast, some mining, particularly for elemental metals, can essentially be done in three dimensions, although, of course, there are increasing costs for deep digging.\n\n>If we then consider which commodities would be optimally suitable for providing a basis for a means of transferring utility, and if we specifically consider the possibility that the trading partners may be located in different nations and perhaps on different continents, than the suitability of such commodities with regard to the ideal function of facilitating utility transfer depends on the extent to which such a commodity seems to have a value independent of its geographical location.\n\n>Clearly, in terms of this geographical perspective, gold has historically been optimal, largely because the labor cost of moving it over great distances is so small relative to the value of what is being transported.  Thus, gold formed a very efficiently movable medium for the transportation of a value exchangeable for other values, ultimately deriving, in one way or another, from human labor (with the achievements of warriors here also being viewed as involving labor).\n\n>Nowadays, however, few would propose a return to the actual use of simply the metal gold as a standard, for the following reasons.\n(i) The cost of mining gold effectively does depend on the technology. Recent cyanide leaching techniques have made it possible again to profitability mind gold at formerly abandoned sites in the U.S. so that it is now a big producer.  However, the unpredictability of the cost is a negative factor.\n(ii) The location of potential gold-mining locations may not be \xe2\x80\x9cpolitically appealing.\xe2\x80\x9d so it would seem undesirable to make a political choice to enhance the economic importance of those particular areas.\n(iii) There is some negative psychology about gold such tat even if it were the most logical choice after all, the unpopularity of the idea could be very obstructive.\n\n>However, right now platinum would be even better than gold, because it has more value per unit of weight.>Crude petroleum could also be used for barter transactions, and in view of the present state of the global economy it would seem a proper component of an index of prices of internationally traded commodities that enter into the costs of industrial consumption.': 1, '>There is a problem for the issuer of a currency, whether in coinage, paper, or electronic form, that if this currency (or money) is too good, then it could be exploited by all sorts of parties\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n>If the value trend of a currency is such that a natural interest rate is not negative, then it is not an unattractive task for a central currency authority to mint or print the physical currency that would circulate.\n\n> Hence, the problem of a money that would be too good is avoidable.': 1, 'I\'m not saying that "finite-ness" of supply is irrelevant for determining the value (or price) of various commodities.

However, the logic underpinning the "leaves make bad money" argument actually rests on the assumption that because a particular good may have an infinite supply it ALSO has a near zero marginal cost of production - and that is not necessarily true.  It is more accurate to set the presence of a significant marginal cost of production structure as an important condition for a "good" money.  \n\nFor example, if every other planet in the universe were made entirely of gold ore, there would be a (near) infinite supply of gold, but it could still make a very good money because there would be a significant marginal cost structure of actually producing that gold as money - and it would therefore be very difficult to counterfeit productivity with gold.\n\nNote that the purpose of a money is to store and easily exchange/transport excess productivity, so when you create money without an additional productivity input (with a near-zero marginal cost of production) you are actually counterfeiting productivity and by doing so lessening the value of (stealing from) all other productivity that has been stored using that form of money.  On the other hand, if there is a significant marginal cost of production structure to whatever good you plan to use as money (no matter how plentiful it is) then the creation of an additional unit of that money will actually require a significant additional productivity output and the counterfeiting of productivity does not occur.

Pretty simple. Hence, people who originally had no interest in running a node aren\'t forced to any longer. \n\nI\'d also say that the increasing use/utility of Bitcoin, reflected by the number of transactions on the blockchain, has increased its value bringing more people into the economy. Given that mining pools and farms aren\'t going away, the mining side of the network has gotten more decentralized as the value of the economy has grown. If you look at the division of mining power on the network, it\'s much more spread out now than it was 3, 4, 5 years ago, because there\'s so much more value there. A long time ago, ASICMINer owned 30% of it. More recently ghash.io got 50%. Now it\'s more evenly divided than ever, with Chinese farms, mining pools etc, and that\'s because of the increase in value spurred on by the use of the blockchain. \n\nAnd lastly, if resources get constrained for many current nodes due to bigger and bigger blocks, that should be a GOOD thing.  We can\'t have a global payment network if the infrastructure is hobbled so much that it\'s forced to be able to run on raspberry pis with SD cards forever. Nor is decentralization helped by keeping the blockchain so small thAt a node can be hosted run on some of the smallest VPS\' available. I mean, do you consider it decentralized when tons of nodes are running out of the same VPS providers? That\'s only a few "cease and desists" away from seeing a huge loss of infrastructure. \n\nSo decentralization or resilience. I think resilience should be the goal. Not to have as many nodes as you can just because you can, but to have a still large but maybe not as lArge network of nodes hosted on machines that can handle current and increasing transaction volumes. \n\nAlmost anyone can host a node, 50 gb isn\'t a big commitment to anyone but a Pi user or VPS user. So, if an increase of requirements pushes the off the network, sure the total node count goes down further, but maybe we shouldn\'t even be counting them in the first place when figuring out how decentralized we are \n\n': 1, "> Then we should be less trusting and assume that the banks and other Johnny-Come-Lateleys are out to subvert/destroy Bitcoin\n\nWe'll then that is only fair, it is a clearly stated goal of bitcoin to subvert the established institutions.\n": 1, 'Avast will take care of it.': 1, 'True.
