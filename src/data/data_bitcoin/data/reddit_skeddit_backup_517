For example, if 0.001 is worth 1 Euro, then it might be easier to change where the decimal point is displayed, so if you had 1 Bitcoin it\'s now displayed as 1000, and 0.001 is displayed as 1.\n\n[Source](https://bitcoinfoundation.org/forum/index.php?/topic/54-my-first-message-to-satoshi/) (half way down)\n\n> If it gets tiresome working with small numbers, we could change where the display shows the decimal point.

It's possible that it is just now finding a reasonable value or it may drop again.

Obviously in terms of the tech and verifications it\'s different, but process from the user point of view seems almost identical: use a wallet to send money > go to a second device/wallet to verify transaction > transaction completed. Of course, in 2-2 multisig both signatories are online so it can be a little smoother, but the logic seems similar.\n\nI guess just conceptually the nomenclature was a bit confusing. When I first was reading up on setting up the cold wallet with a corresponding watch-only wallet, I envisioned two wallets that mirrored each other but one didn\'t touch the internet (and the offline one would get all the transaction history of the online one every time it signed new transactions). When I had electrum set up on the offline machine, this idea was reinforced since there were all of these tabs and fields that I imagined would fill up as the wallet got used. I realize now though that they\'ll just stay empty. \n\nIt reminds me of the way they do official business in China.

If that fails, perhaps the information you saved to the file from your offline wallet is faulty somehow. Unfortunately, I haven't tried Electrum's offline capability yet, so this is just general advice.  \n\n> Also, as a possibly related question (maybe this is what is causing the error), how do you get received funds to show on the offline wallet? Is there someway that the two sync or is the offline wallet really just a way to sign and verify the transactions?  \n\nIf you intend to ensure safety (coldness) of your funds at your offline Electrum wallet, it should never be connected to the Internet. In this case, it will never know the balances sent to the private keys created from its seed. This is what the root public key and your online Electrum client are for.

Also feels like having the full wallet software setup when you really just need something with the private key to verify/sign transactions is a little overkill. Anyway, I understand it's all free software so I can't complain. It was misleading for someone new to Bitcoin like myself.

Contact customers proactively when there is an issue\n\n2. Let them know what is required from them to resolve the issue proactively (instead of waiting 48+ hours to respond to your customers query) \n\n3. Address the questions asked in your customers query, so they don\'t have to ask again, and again, and again - whilst waiting 24+ hours each time to get a response that still avoids certain questions to the initial comment\n\n4. Respond to your customers FASTER (24+ hours is not acceptable when depositing large funds, especially when there is an issue with these types of transactions), raise priority cases for customers so they receive faster responses and are therefore actually made to feel like their situation is important to iGot\n\n5. Stop using compliance as an excuse for poor customer service\n\n**Conclusion: Contact your customers, instead of waiting for them to contact you. Explain the situation thoroughly by providing ETAs and documents required to resolve issue (if these ETA\'s can\'t be met, be proactive and contact your customer again explaining this). Respond to your customers that are in these unique situations FASTER by prioritising them.**\n\n\n**Follow these steps in the future Rick and team iGot and you will have more satisfied customers.**\n\n\n': 1, 'I\'d like to change my e-mail, however, I have been advised that I cannot do this for security reasons and have been advised to open another account with igot.com, however - as I am a user that has already been verified I\'d like to request to have my e-mail changed by an administrator so that I can continue to receive updates and be able to reset my details (if the time ever comes) and for when a "request via e-mail" is sent to do so. \n\nWould this be possible as I am not planning on opening a new account with igot.com just to have a new e-mail and have to re-verify my identity all over again, seems rather pointless that I would have to get this far to make that part happen.': 1, "It's actually nearly been 5 days (which I should have edited) , we're taking about a large sum of money and these people commit to a 24hr response to your inquiry and a max of 3 days to receive a deposit.

I think you\'d have a hard time arguing that Electrum or Mycelium "suck at privacy" to use your words.  I think a much larger concern is whether right now any bitcoin wallet available (or bitcoin itself) has integrated anonymity as an option within the protocol.  The answer is no.  As a result, privacy has to be cobbled together using a variety of available tools.  I think that if zerocash were to be used to construct an alt that were interchangeable with bitcoin, that would be a substantial step in the right direction; alternatively, if developers could simply work out their op_return issues and implement the Stealth BIP, that would be huge, for it would put something close to anonymity within the reach of most users.  \nBut we are not there yet.': 1, 'Bypassing regulations often ends poorly... take the time to evaluate the risk/reward.': -2, '[removed]': 0, 'I use coinkite for personal and business.\n': -1, "Now just imagine if a state in the USA tried to ban the EURO because they didn't like it.

A ledger entry controlled by a private key. \n\nIndeed saying "intrinsic properties" as opposed to "intrinsic value" might be less confusing. But as I pointed out, the term "intrinsic value" is already well defined as such in the context of gold coins. It means the market value of the stuff of which its comprised - what you can sell the coin for even if it\'s melted down and were stripped of its rarity and government backing. Schiff, as a gold dealer, should know better. \n\nIn bitcoin we have intrinsic value/properties *and nothing else*, so it gets a little harder for people to grasp when they can\'t contrast that to legal face value or rarity premium as you have with traditional coins.': 1, 'Perhaps this man, who is much more intelligent than I am, can better explain my reasoning: \r\rhttp://fee.org/freeman/detail/the-fallacy-of-intrinsic-value\r\rI am not trying to change the definition of the phrase "intrinsic value", I am simply saying that the *natural* meaning of the combination of words "intrinsic" and "value" is very different from the formal definition of the phrase "intrinsic value", and that this misnomer causes a lot of fallacious logic as people assume the natural meaning instead  of the formal.': 1, 'Eric was polite but then again he was taking to a gold bug... \n\nDid you know that mining for gold increases by 3% every year? what is the doubling time on that?\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_mining#/media/File:Gold_quantity.svg\n': 0, "I don't buy this explanation of the origin of money any more. People used all sorts of things as money before gold became the standard and those things were not always valuable in themselves like seashells or those giant stone disks. The important part is that they were scarce, not that they were inherently valuable.\n\nUsing scarce objects as a medium of exchange is a kind of distributed ledger. If you doubt this remember that cryptocurrencies are sometimes called digital tokens and a scarce object being used as a medium of exchange is a physical token. Cryptocurrency is a better ledger and so it will win in the end and we can take the gold out of the vaults and make electronics and shit with it. ": 11, 'As a long time adherent of Austrian economics, it was a little unnerving to realize that even the Austrians got it wrong about money. Not just the regression theorem, but the whole idea of a "medium of exchange" itself distorts the picture or least misplaces the key emphasis. I will make the case in this comment.\n\nThe key point is subtle: it\'s not really proper to say that money is exchanged for goods, or even that goods are exchanged via money.\n\nIt\'s fairly easy to see that one can\'t really speak of "exchanging via bitcoins" without tacitly referring to Bitcoin the system. It is much harder to discern that one can\'t really speak of "exchanging via gold" without tacitly referring to Gold the system (with a capital G). Because Gold doesn\'t seem like a system; it seems like a gram of gold is accepted by merchants for a new wheelbarrow because some people will always value it at some similar level. \n\nBut that value from being able to find someone who wants gold for its beauty or whatever is much smaller than the value imparted by the social convention to use Gold the system. And again it doesn\'t *seem* like a social convention; it seems everyone just uses it because it has the best monetary properties. However, I think we can be sure that very few people are actually cognizant of any such thing. What they are cognizant of is Gold the system: the fact that giving someone gold is the primary or most efficient way to get them to give you things you need in society.\n\nMost rich people in a society that uses Gold are not smiling because they have so much shiny stuff to look at. They\'re smiling because they have a lot of points in the Gold system. They can get other people to do a lot for them. If their society were to move to a different point system, their wealth would be reduced ten- or twenty-fold. In a society in those times that could mean the difference between affluence and destitution. \n\nFundamentally, trading gold for goods/services wasn\'t ever (or not for very long) about giving someone something they want in exchange for something you want; it wasn\'t even about giving someone something *someone else* wants in exchange for something you want. The Austrian story is not quite right. Rather it was primarily (in terms of the lion\'s share of the value) about chalking up points to someone in a point system, and Bitcoin simply functions as a better point system than Gold.\n\nThe phrasing "exchange bitcoins for X" leads people toward thinking there is something special or desirable about these points themselves, to someone at least. And surely there is to a few people, and that is relevant for the regression theorem, but it is beside the point: the vast part of the value imparted to a bitcoin is not from the fact that a few people want them for esoteric reasons, but from the realization that the world (or a sizable part of it) is switching to the Bitcoin system.\n\nUnder Gold, we could get away with the loose phrasing and the subtle fiction of "medium of exchange" that suggested a conflation of gold\'s monetary value with its decorative value. We could get away with it because there was no real penalty for getting it wrong. The conclusion was right for the wrong reason. The loose phrasing did no harm there that I\'m aware of, which is why Austrians are still able to make a lot of good commentary on the economy in general.\n\nHowever, under Bitcoin this phrasing does do harm because this time the misconception happens to lead people to the wrong conclusion instead of the right one. It\'s just the common situation where subtle flaws in an old way of conceiving something that didn\'t really matter before start to matter now when a new phenomenon or deeper analysis requires more rigor. \n\nSchiff is caught up in this.

Gold has intrinsic properties that *some* humans find useful or valuable for whatever reason they decide, and that reason need not be rational. There is no law of physics that states that we humans must give value to Gold. \n\nBitcoin also has intrinsic properties that many people find useful and valuable, but it has no intrinsic value because *nothing* has intrinsic value because there is no such thing. All value is subject to change, and nothing is immune from having zero or near zero value. \n\nAt the current moment in time, Bitcoin has superior intrinsic *properties* to Gold and Silver, and I therefore value it more than either, but I refuse to say that it or anything else has intrinsic value.': 2, '> The key point is subtle: it\'s not really proper to say that money is exchanged for goods, or even that goods are exchanged via money.\n> It\'s fairly easy to see that one can\'t really speak of "exchanging via bitcoins" without tacitly referring to Bitcoin the system.

Bitcoin has much greater chance of going to zero than gold does. However, what he misses is only a few things can happen which would drive Bitcoin's price to zero. One would be an insurmountable flaw in its security, which is based on math, where risk is somewhat calculable. Another is replacement by some superior alternative cryptocurrency. That's also unlikely (a handful may co-exist and complement, but not likely replace). Any problem beyond these two has diminishing chances of driving price to zero, maybe lower but not zero.\n\nOnce one understands how hard it is to drive Bitcoin's price to zero, it only then takes the merest imagination and logic to see how it derives intrinsic value.

Bitcoin did become used as money almost immediately, despite having no prior non-monetary use. I guess the question is how long it will survive as such, and what we\'re really trying to figure out is how Bitcoin might differ from the usually short-lived paper instruments that have come and gone.\n\nConsider gold - I think there\'s a misconception that anyone actually values gold for its non-monetary uses. The ancients thought it was pretty and they made jewelry out of it, but the jewelry itself was regarded as a store of value. They were just making nice stuff *out of money*. Central banks don\'t hold gold because they like the idea that it can be used for tooth filling or electrical contacts. They hold it because it\'s money! Actually society would benefit most by using a commodity that has *no* industrial uses, or else people would have to sacrifice those uses to the extent that the commodity is used as money.\n\nAnother way to think of this though, is that when we say "intrinsic", what we\'re really getting at is whether the market recognizes the money as being valuable *per se*, as opposed to being valued for something that is *extrinsic* to the unit of currency, such as a guarantee of redeemability for something else like gold or oil. Bitcoin fully satisfies *this* definition of "intrinsic" because nobody values it based on an external promise - it is not a note but a commodity. The value is nowhere but IN the commodity, therefore the value is intrinsic. This definition is well accepted in the context of numismatic coins, where we distinguish between melt value, face value, and collector value. Bitcoin has the equivalent of "melt value" and nothing else.\n\nIt\'s really exhausting to hear people parrot this "intrinsic value" term without being more clear as to what they\'re getting at.
