Once a politician gets your vote, they can do whatever the fuck they want until the next election.  A revocable proxy forces them to pay more attention, since you can take it away if they are not doing what you want.\n\nThe complicated part from my standpoint is policies vs people to implement the policies.  It's easy to vote for a political party or candidate because their stated policies line up with what you want.  It's harder to be sure they will follow such policies afterwards.

Sure, to some degree....likely for a very long time, probably decades, there will still be organizations which are made up of people who voluntarily associate and pool resources to accomplish goals they agree on.   \n\nI don't see any way to do something like this now -- we've tried to move toward crowdfunding -- we've cut central funding of things like Bitcoin.org, bitnodes and grants -- allowing these to be funded directly by the public (which actually ends up more centralized as the founders tend to be single corporations).\n\nWhat else can be done by us at this stage?   Do you think we should not exist because a decentralized model which right now does not exist will take our place?   If so then why don't you build that model and get it going?  Our board member Olivier spent $100,000 on a decentralized project to replace the foundation -did you support that?\n\nSo decentralization is the wave of the future.  We get it.  If you have the impression of the Bitcoin Foundation being a bunch of old bankers holding our hands up to stop the world from moving forward then you have the wrong impression.   If you can show me a way to serve the members I represent and be decentralized then great.\n\nMeanwhile, why bash us just for being an organization with the type of structure used by thousands of others?   Why not focus on criticism of much larger, more centralized, less transparent organizations:  the RNC, DNC whatever.   This is a tiny industry -- why not help our small organization try to do things that help Bitcoin rather than being against?  \n\n": 3, 'I think you\'ll find, as I did, that Bruce and the board are now and (I expect) will remain incredibly open to communication and inputs from the community, and from you.

Voting by everyone is dicey - to really have the best outcome, those who make decisions have to know what\'s going on, and in any modern large group there is a wide diversity of knowledge among people involved.   This is especially true in a techno-enabled collective where the issues at hand are INCREDIBLY complex.
