Instead, the BTC price will rise, and the mining industry will probably shrink; as time goes by, the price will rise less and less, and the mining industry will shrink more and more.\n\nHopefully, transaction *volume* can increase to spread the costs across more people.\n\nIt should be noted that according to [the same analysis of real-world data](https://tradeblock.com/blog/bitcoin-network-capacity-analysis-part-2-macro-transaction-trends), "the average bitcoin transaction data size has grown to roughly 600 bytes".\n\nThus, in a *completely&nbsp;full* **100&nbsp;MB block**, you could get 166666 transactions of an average nature; that\'s 277.8 transactions per second.

Strong undertones of concern over possible negative reprisals and suspicion of being "set up" or having one\'s words taken out of context to support or undermine some crypto tribal agenda.  Plus a lot of people are simply unable to discuss their situations due to ongoing legal engagements or because they have some questionable skeletons in their closet they\'d rather not risk being discovered. \n\nThe net effect of this is to produce puzzling interactions where, to cite one strikingly consistent pattern,  conversations exchanged over multiple emails, PMs, DMs, IMs will inexplicably stop and go unanswered for days or weeks, and then just as suddenly, will pick up again as though nothing unusual happened. Or there will never be another reply at all.  Tracking people down by phone can be dicey as well, even if the number is public, because many of the motives for doing so are rightly viewed with suspicion.  \n\nHonest reporting requires trust, and trust takes a long time to earn (and is easily lost) - this is more true in the crypto world than many other places.

I\'m also not too sure about how many people are actually investing in it, sometimes giving something coverage when it is that small-time can have an undesired effect. Perhaps if I dug a little harder, but there are a thousand small-time scams in Crypto and a thousand more that are probably scams but it is extremely tough to prove.\n\nYesterday I got an email about some "revolutionary new currency" that has some link to the bible and the "1% have been using it for years, now you can too!" it is a complete scam.

[Plus earn $10 in bitcoin per typo found in manuscript]', 315): {"I\xe2\x80\x99d like to share a research paper I\xe2\x80\x99ve recently completed titled \xe2\x80\x9cA Transaction Fee Market Exists Without a Block Size Limit.\xe2\x80\x9d   In addition to presenting some useful charts such as the cost to produce large spam blocks, I think the paper convincingly demonstrates that due to the orphaning cost, a block size limit is not necessary to ensure a functioning fee market.  \n\nThe paper does not argue that a block size limit is unnecessary in general, and in fact brings up questions related to mining cartels and the size of the UTXO set.   \n\nIt can be downloaded in PDF format here:\n\nhttps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/43331625/feemarket.pdf\n\nOr viewed with a web-browser here:\n\nhttps://www.scribd.com/doc/273443462/A-Transaction-Fee-Market-Exists-Without-a-Block-Size-Limit\n\n**Abstract.**  This paper shows how a rational Bitcoin miner should select transactions from his node\xe2\x80\x99s mempool, when creating a new block, in order to maximize his profit in the absence of a block size limit. To show this, the paper introduces the *block space supply curve* and the *mempool demand curve*.  The former describes the cost for a miner to supply block space by accounting for orphaning risk.  The latter represents the fees offered by the transactions in mempool, and is expressed versus the minimum block size required to claim a given portion of the fees.  The paper explains how the supply and demand curves from classical economics are related to the derivatives of these two curves, and proves that producing the quantity of block space indicated by their intersection point maximizes the miner\xe2\x80\x99s profit.  The paper then shows that an unhealthy fee market\xe2\x80\x94where miners are incentivized to produce arbitrarily large blocks\xe2\x80\x94cannot exist since it requires communicating information at an arbitrarily fast rate.  The paper concludes by considering the conditions under which a rational miner would produce big, small or empty blocks, and by estimating the cost of a spam attack.  \n\n\n[$10 BOUNTIES] Find an error in the PDF manuscript (excluding end notes), report it by responding to this comment along with your bitcoin address and receive $10!!

Bitcoind also downloads the blockchain from connected nodes by default so you're actually running a 'full node' because you have a full history of all bitcoin transactions. A full node is great for communicating on the network directly without having to use someone elses service and adds a layer of redundancy backup to the network.\n\n\nIf you mine (please don't bother but just saying :)) you're helping produce the 'correct' blockchain by essentially casting your vote for which blocks are valid based on your hashing power.  Typically home users don't even make a dent in the hashing power directly so contribute via pools which are again just bitcoind clients with a layer on top allowing people put their hashing power together to share out the reward payments when a pool wins a block. This helps miners receive more regular smaller payments rather than nothing for ages until finally they hit the jackpot and win a block.\n\n\nHard forking typically happens when clients disagree on what makes a valid block, no one wants to work on the minority fork since they're wasting energy for no return so a lot of effort is made by miners to use the most compatible bitcoin protocol (typically the latest bitcoind client). \n": 1, 'You might want to read [this](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Network)\n\nTL:DR Bitcoin does not have or need *master nodes*': 1, 'Thank you, though I\'m trying to grasp the concept of decentralization specifically. \n\nThink of it like this.

For each record, Tierion generates a blockchain receipt that contains all the information needed to verify the data without relying on a trusted third party. No altcoin required. Tierion scales to handle millions of records without bloating the blockchain. We've created an open standard for notarizing data in the blockchain and generating blockchain receipts called Chainpoint. You can download a draft of the white paper from our web site and checkout the source code on Github.\n\nWith Tierion, we wanted the process of securing data in the blockchain to be completely transparent to customers. We're a SaaS application with an easy signup process. You simply interact with our REST API or send us data via web forms and Tierion takes care of the rest. We even interface with [Zapier](http://zapier.com), which lets us integrate with over 400 apps. Just the other day, our team was generating blockchain receipts for every email sent and received from a Gmail account. Politicians and folks in highly regulated industries might find that useful.\n\nMy point is that we worked hard to build a product that our customers love.

That digital data can be stolen and not recovered, either tracking down the thieves is much more difficult and if you do they may have made copies or sent them makes a challenging threat. Bitcoin is a juicy target for malicious people, it can be stolen immeditally and without recourse. \n\nBitcoin companies have been hacked many times, we will try to name some of them here.

While giving a friend of your too much money on accident isn't so bad as you can usually get it back from them, sending too much money as a bitcoin transaction fee to a miner can be bad.

Keep the private key associated with each public addresses decoded into an integer in a table.  The private keys will then look random. At this point is when you start to compare from pub address one to which pub address has the next private key in sequence (think of it like cross divide and multiply), then so on and so on, eventually you should be able to find a pattern that'll get you close to the range in private key, which then can be scoured in both directions looking for the key pair match, then you would use this result to find out how off your pattern was and readjust.  \nI'm not claiming that I'll be able to find this in my lifetime, or that my idea is correct (I haven't even decided where my division by modulo/moduli are yet, need more data, but I have an idea), but I think that this will emerge as a major study, and eventually it will succeed to some degree and thus make recirculation miners become another industry.
