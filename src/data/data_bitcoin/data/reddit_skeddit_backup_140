It assumes that demand is somewhat constant, and that it will meet with supply curve at, for example, $28 per barrel. Because the supply curve has a lot of momentum (it can't stop going down quickly), demand will quickly surpass supply, leading to extremely (x10) high oil prices in the short term. That's the event that the oil companies have been waiting for during the entirety of 2015. It would mean very high gas prices and shortages for the consumer.\n\nSecond, the alternative scenario: For some reason, demand keeps sinking together with supply. Then oil prices will stay low for a very long time, completely bankrupting oil companies and oil-export-dependent nations. This is the worst-case scenario that the experts fear. For the consumer, it means that he can't afford gas even at low prices (for example, due to unemployment, or because the national currency is in hyperinflation).\n\nNow, the question is only in which scenario we are in right now.

This may not be very important for someone who just wants to offset heating costs but it is still important in terms of how decentralized mining is.  ": 1, "Now imagine we had a network of nodes which don't understand the transactions they're seeing but simply wave them on through. This is the state of the node network after a soft fork - they cannot validate the new transactions, and they just pass them along.\n\nIs this better or worse than having large numbers of nodes?\n\nI think we both want the same thing - large numbers of validating nodes in diverse hands.\n\nI believe that will come from improving the utility of the bitcoin network so that more stakeholders will be attracted. That means increasing the maximum permissible block size so that the network can handle more transactions. This makes it more useful and therefore new people will be attracted to the system.\n\nNow correct me if I'm wrong, but you seem to think that there's a simple linear correlation between the number of nodes and the maximum permissible block size as set in software, regardless of the utility of that block size or the demand for block size and network buy-in from new users. Larger blocks = fewer nodes, smaller blocks = more nodes. You have completely discounted the historic separation of mining from the relay and validation functions of nodes and the uptake of SPV wallets. Please correct me if I'm mis-stating your position here.\n\nThis is now a \xc2\xa37bn economy, not a bedroom pastime for geeks anymore.": 2, "To pre-2015 levels--I don't really know.

This is an area ripe for research. It also explains my stance against soft forks which reduce the number and proportion of full validating nodes.": 2, "It is actually the converse that I am arguing. \n\nVer is claiming a correlation between block size and the number of full nodes without any evidence. If there were a causal relationship, as he claims, then there would be positive correlation between the two. Correlation by itself does not prove causation, but conversely if you have causation you do also have correlation. \n\nAs it stands we do have correlative evidence to the contrary of Ver's claim. This does not prove the hypothesis that increased user adoption leads to fewer full nodes, particularly since there is also the affect of increased SPV transactions confounding this data. But I do believe that a more reasonable theory has to take into account a cost/benefit analysis for running a node.\n\nWhereas:\n\na.) Increasing costs in the form of storage and bandwidth act as a disincentive to operate full listening nodes. \n\nb.) The availability of SPV transactions remove the incentive for maintaining a wallets on a full nodes.\n\nc.) An increase in the rate that transactions occur also increases the cost for operating full nodes in terms of storage and bandwidth.(restatement of point a) \n\nd.) Technological deflation should reduce the cost for operating full nodes over time, but there is nothing tying the rate if transactions to technological deflation which it would likely outrun.\n\ne.) If the number of full listening nodes declines this increases the risk that Bitcoin's security assumptions will be violated.\n\nf.) Without a concrete incentive for the specific task of operating full listening nodes we risk a tragedy of the commons as the cost for operating those nodes is absorbed by fewer charitable volunteers.\n\nEdit: some words.

Now imagine someone wants to do something you don't agree with. You can't spool up a node to run the software you support. They can pass laws to turn you into a criminal for running the software you want, or in the right political climate accuse you of treason, so the people who can afford nodes won't run the software you want. There's no choice anymore, just what can be imposed by, or onto the few capable of running nodes. \n\nThats why Core is trying to approach scaling delicately, and do as much as they can without touching the blocksize limit first.
