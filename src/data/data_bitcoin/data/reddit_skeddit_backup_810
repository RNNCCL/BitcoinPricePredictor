Historically this leverage ratio can be found at a factor of about 3.3 or 30%.

Banks don't loan out more money than they have with fractional reserve banking. All it means is that they have to keep in reserve (in their vault) a percentage of their total holdings. They can loan out the rest. So with bitcoin, just as with cash, there is no reason they can not do this.\n\nIf a bank has 1000 bitcoins on hand, and fractional reserve banking laws say it must hold 10%, then they can loan out 900 bitcoins. That's all fractional reserve banking is.\n\nEdit: Where fractional reserve banking becomes hairy, and where it is criticized, is when the process is reproduced with the same moey from bank to bank to bank. So bank A holds 1000 bitcoins/cash and lends Ted 900. Ted then deposits that money into bank B. Bank B then lends out 810 bitcoins to Bob. Bob deposits the money into bank C. Bank C then lends 730 bitcons to Sue. Etc etc. So you can see that *no new money* is created with this process. However with only 1000 total bitcoins/cash originally deposited, over 2540 were lent out and paying interest back to the banks. This is all because banks only need to keep a fraction of reserves on hand. Again I want to stress, this is *not* literally creating new money, which is why it is still possible with bitcoins. This is just lending out the same bitcoin/dollar over and over again, so that multiple banks can collect interest on the same bitcoin/dollor at the same time. ": 2, 'You\'re wrong. If people hold their bitcoins in a bank, the bank can "loan" out those bitcoins in the exact same way it does with cash. Banks can absolutely implement fractional reserve practices with bitcoin.

Anyway, I really would like to find someone who knows what he's talking about to explain to me how btc prevents fractional reserve, since I with my Coursera level understanding of banking and finance just don't see it.": 2, "Circle or Coinbase? We already have BitFinex and BTCJam offering interest on deposits and lending! But we also already have decentralized exchanges and soon we'll have smart property, and with that, simple market forces will raise standards. Depositing money to a third party will probably be present for a long(ish) time, but everybody who can will lend through smart contracts which guarantee that trader he's lending to will get margin called as soon as he can't repay. And if you want to earn interest through lending, will you choose BTCJam-like lending, where you basically can't collect if the borrower defaults, or will you choose smart contract which gives you complete control over borrower's car if he defaults, and where you can order that car to drive itself to you when that happens?\n\nWe have a lot of players looking to reinvent traditional banking services inside cryptocurrencies. If I were a bank, I'd be researching Bitcoin furiously at this point and drafting new models to stay relevant. And many of them do, although most are sluggish as all big organizations are.

FR banking facilitates this function, but at the cost of an ever increasing money supply.    You can\'t have fractional reserve lending with bitcoin because there is a FIXED money supply.  I can\'t lend out more bitcoin than I actually have. This is different from fiat.\n\nWith fiat, say a bank has $100.  That\'s all they have in the vault..well with a reserve requirement of 10:1 they can actually lend out $1000.  This is $900 more dollars than existed previously.  This $900 will be deposited into other banks so it goes into the money supply...but (and this is important) that $900 DID NOT EXIST until the bank made a few keystrokes and cut a check.  This is how the money supply is constantly increasing.

I don\'t understand how a website can be taken down through spam, but Bitcoin cannot.\n\nA website can be taken down by heavy traffic because it\'s hosted on just one server with a limited capacity to send/receive traffic - how much capacity the site owner buys depends on how much traffic they\'re expecting and a sudden unexpected rush of people can overwhelm that allowance and take the site offline, whether because of an attack or because you just got linked from a popular news site (see also "Slashdot effect", "Reddit hug of death", or whatever we used to call it when Digg did the same thing)\n\nThe solution there is to spread the load across many servers, and deflect as much of the spam as possible with simple responses (e.g. a static page that can be cached by their ISP instead of something complicated that the server has to generate fresh for each visitor). Which you can do by signing up for a service like Akamai or Cloudflare, who have those multiple servers already well placed around the world.\n\nThe bitcoin network is by nature already decentralised - there\'s no single point you can direct a flood of traffic at that\'s going to take the network down. Not unless you can flood a significant fraction of nodes all at once, which is going to be *really difficult* to achieve, and even then the other nodes will carry on as best they can.\n\nThat being said, there are DoS attacks that don\'t rely on a flood of traffic - it stands for \'denial of service\', so any means of blocking other users will fit the definition. For example you could spew millions of transactions into the network, to the point where miners selecting random transactions to put into blocks are getting like... 99% your stuff, and not much in the way of \'real\' transactions. But the system is designed to make that sort of thing costly so that it can\'t be sustained for long before you run out of resources to keep attacking with - if you want to spew transactions either you need to pay fees, or you need a steady supply of high-priority (old) coins, which is naturally rate-limited.\n\nOr if you had a majority of the hash-power you could deny service by mining endless empty blocks and extending the longest chain faster than anyone else can mine \'real\' blocks... but that would also be costly just in sheer electricity bills, and the opportunity cost of the mining fees that you\'re leaving on the table.': 3, 'At the very least, instead of focusing their entire botnet on a few (dozens at most) IP addresses, attackers would need to try to saturate thousands. It\'s not immune to such attacks, but the Bitcoin network seems like it would be a tougher target.  \n\nEDIT: /u/x798\'s source for his contention that raising the 125 peer limit causes crashes and memory corruption is apparently supplied by "somebody who knew" told him.': 2, "> How is the Bitcoin network immune to a DOS attack? I don't understand how a website can be taken down through spam, but Bitcoin cannot.\n\nThere is no central point of failure in the Bitcoin network. You can perform a DOS attack against one or several nodes, but with thousands of nodes in the network, at most you will accomplish some minor inconvenience with the users running those nodes. Compare this to a website, which typically has just one (or in case of large websites, several) server that is a single point of failure. Attack those and the entire thing goes down.\n\nSince there is a minimum amount that has to be sent in a transaction before it gets relayed by most nodes (or mined into a block), you can't DOS the network with transactions either.\n\n> Is there a minimum speed internet connection I can use and still be beneficial to the network, and not slow it down?\nThe network doesn't really get affected if you have a slow connection. Worst case scenario is that the updates you relay are delayed, but since every node is connected to multiple others, a single slow node isn't a problem at all. This is the essence of a decentralized network.\n\nAs for the bandwidth needed, on average a block is found every 10 minutes and the current maximum blocksize is 1 MB. Between blocks, new transactions are also broadcast, but in total you should be fine with 56k6 dialup internet to stay up-to-date with the network, for now.\n\n> If there is a fork in the blockchain, and I have had coins saved on it for a while (ie months before it happened), does this mean they are immune to it?\n\nWhen the blockchain forks, there will be 2 different transaction ledgers that are identical up to the moment of the fork, but will diverge afterwards. Depending on the cause of the fork, most transactions after the fork will still end up on both branches. Any coins that were received and confirmed before the fork-point will stay that way and can be spent in either branch of the fork (this allows for a potential to double-spend if one merchant is on branch A and the other is on branch B, but the time-window and technical expertise required make this tricky). Any transaction done after the fork can end up in either one of the branches or in both. If the transaction only ends up in one branch and the network reaches consensus to resolve the fork by picking the other branch, your transaction is no longer confirmed (but may still be picked up if it does not violate the rules of the winning branch).": 1, ">There's a very small number of nodes with listening sockets.  \n\nWell, what's a small number? According to [Bitnodes](https://getaddr.bitnodes.io/dashboard/), there've been ~6,500 to ~7,000 full nodes for the last 60 days. I don't know if that's a big number, but I suspect it would be a challenge for a botnet to DDOS.  \n\nI would also wonder about the motivation. DDOS attacks usually have specific extortion targets. Who is an attacker expecting to get paid by for attacking the entire Bitcoin network?": 1, 'There have been some phenomenal answers to this question already, but the underlying principle to why websites can be crashed, where as Bitcoin cannot be is the concept of a [Single Point of Failure](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_point_of_failure).

I would imagine a coordinated attack from a highly motivated criminal ring (or government) could probably bring down the Bitcoin network right now, but if it continues to grow it becomes *much* harder to bring it down.': 1, "> If there is a fork in the blockchain, and I have had coins saved on it for a while (ie months before it happened), does this mean they are immune to it?\n\nA fork creates two separate valid blockchains, using slightly different protocols, which have some shared history up to a point and then diverge at whichever block is invalid according to one of those protocols. For ease of reference, call the two sides of the split Bitcoin-A and Bitcoin-B.\n\nThe problem is the confusion over which chain is going to turn out to be the accepted 'real' one by everyone else, and hence which transactions can be trusted - if a transaction only appears on Bitcoin-A then it might turn out that the Bitcoin-B side eventually wins out and then you're left holding worthless A-coins that you exchanged for something of actual value. \n\nIf you have coins from transactions *before* the fork then they appear on both sides of the split and are unaffected.": 1, "> Anyway let us know why specifically you think you'd need the update on cold storage.

You are not going to *lose* anything doing any updates with Armory, I believe they make this a priority always when they update the software too... **But**, I think there are some issues if you are signing tx\'s generated on very new versions of the software using older versions on your offline machine (pre 0.91?).\n\nHopefully an Armory dev or someone more knowledgeable than me will comment and add to this, but this was my experience.': 5, "Generally wallets are backwards compatible with their own wallets.

If you know that the private key was derived from a seed with less entropy than the size of the key itself, then your search space is reduced.

Consumers gonna consume,  Savers gonna save.': 1, "Here's the article:\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n'This month's decreasing bitcoin price has provoked many questions about the market's fundamentals. While it is clear that the price of any asset will be determined by the interplay between buying demand and selling pressure, it is important to understand who the current market participants are and why they make certain decisions.\n\nThe bitcoin market is unique in that it has participants who must sell bitcoin on an ongoing, daily basis. These participants place a consistent downward pressure on the price, which means the bitcoin price naturally has a downward tendency. These selling market participants include:\n\nBitcoin miners\nBitcoin payment processors\n\nIn order for the bitcoin price to increase, downward selling pressure must be outweighed by net buying demand in the market. Market participants that are net buyers include:\n\nBitcoin wallet providers (Circle, Coinbase, Xapo)\nBitcoin ATMs\nSpeculative investors and traders\nConsumer-side payment processors (doesn't really exist yet)\n\nBecause it is easier from a regulatory and technology perspective to build merchant processing platforms versus consumer payments platforms, we have seen greater adoption of bitcoin by merchants versus consumers. Why exactly hasn't consumer adoption taken off? First, the consumer market for private currency is very niche and not very large. Second, bitcoin gives all cost savings and benefits to merchants and not consumers. Third, American Express and other credit card companies entice consumers through rewards programs, which are not yet available to people using bitcoin. At this stage, the bitcoin industry is 2-3 years out from matching credit card companies' value proposition to consumers, and we should expect weak price growth until that is resolved. On the remittance side, it is still difficult to place Bitcoin ATMs across the country in large quantities, which must also be resolved for consumer adoption to grow.\n\nIn summary, we find ourselves in a market where non-speculative bitcoin users are mostly sellers, predominately relying on speculative buyers to support upward price movement. At the moment, there is not enough buy-side demand to outweigh the non-speculative selling pressure.\n\nThe long term outlook for bitcoin is very positive, but there are a number of regulatory, technological and consumer value proposition challenges that still need to be resolved. To assess the fair value of bitcoin, users should analyze bitcoin's current usefulness for consumers versus other payment options that are available. When its value proposition becomes meaningful to a large consumer population, demand for bitcoin will grow\xe2\x80\x93as will the bitcoin price.'\n--------------------------------------------------------\n": 3, 'I think some of us have been talking about this since last year.

Firstly, he thinks he\'s arguing against labor-value theory.  Secondly, he\'s parroting the equally ridiculous Austrian subjective-value theory.\n\nThe reality is that neither is completely correct.  The "production cost" of transporting a gold bar from New York to Shanghai will always be greater than zero.  It doesn\'t really matter what "individuals" *want* this cost to be.  No exercise of personal willpower can change it, because it is a consequence of basic laws of physics.  That cost will also, likely, always be greater than the fee for transmitting the same value of Bitcoin.  And, lastly, there will always be some demand for this service.  If any one of these premises ever change, then it means that Bitcoin has become completely obsolete, and deserves to fail because there is some new, better alternative (that likely violates known physics).\n\n>the businessman would have never taken on the task of providing this good or service, thereby paying these costs, if he did not expect to receive revenue that exceeded the cost of production (since the business man is driven by profit, he would not settle for revenue that was equal to costs)\n\nActually, scratch that.  Three mistakes.  The other mistake is in assuming that profit is necessary in order for Bitcoin miners to process transactions.  In fact, in the long run, miner profit is *antithetical* to the continuing functioning of Bitcoin as a neutral currency.

In the end, complete security is up to the end user.  \n\nEach time you access your BC.i wallet over the Internet, you could be getting a new copy of the javascript code. If BC.i is hacked, has a malicious employee, or goes evil itself, this code could be changed to steal your private keys any time you try to use them. Of course, you can always review the javascript code for yourself, but this is like studying the multiple pages of dense legalese in a terms and conditions form before accepting online bill pay: not many do it.  \n\nOne of the great things about Bitcoin is the freedom of choice it enables. In the extreme, this choice *can* allow anyone to be completely secure on their own, requiring that no trust is vetted in any other party. But this is something that currently requires a tremendous amount of work. Hopefully this will improve as Bitcoin matures, but short of downloading the source code for Bitcoin Core or Armory and compiling it for yourself (of course after you've studied the machine language of the compiler itself for malicious code, and inspecting your hardware piecemeal for embedded malicious firmware), you *always have the choice of who you choose to trust.*  \n\nIn BC.i's case, normal use of their wallet means you trust (or have examined at least once) their javascript code and are further trusting them to keep their infrastructure secure. From that point, as long as you check the URL you use to access them, and when you do access them that they have a valid security certificate authenticated by a CA (which you also must trust), you can have a reasonable level of certainty about the security of your funds when accessed from a secure device.  \n\nWhere this differs from existing currencies and payment systems is that Bitcoin always offers the option of trusting no one at all given you're willing to put in the elbow grease.

Together you essentially get encrypted storage of seeds.\n\nSo not only do they never store your key, but they also don't store your seed in a form they can read (unencrypted).\n\nOf course, there is no guarantee they won't change their software and save your password when you enter it, apply it to their database and take your keys. That's fully possible.\n\nIn short, any key generated by a third party must be considered potentially compromised. This may be fine to you. For example I'm fine with Circle having some of my money in their insured wallets under US law. They've stated they're insured, and on those terms I've entered into contract, and US law provides some security. If an employee goes rogue and steals my coin (likely impossible, as they probably build systems requiring collusion of many individuals including executives to steal) I'm insured under their terms. And the law provides some basic security, i.e. their very public team couldn't get away with saying 'we lied about the insurance', they'd have a huge legal problem. So I feel quite safe here. And I also don't expect the government to seize my account, if they would any bitcoins I'd have in cold-storage would become worthless pretty quickly anyway as it'd mean bitcoin has been hit extremely hard and put on the 'terrorist' type of list.\n\nI trust blockchain.info, too. Cool, professional team. But, not insured. They, too, probably have security in place against an employee uploading some rogue software to the server. But unlike Circle, all bitcoins are essentially in hot-wallets with no insurance against internal theft. \n\nSo what I personally do is keep a hot wallet with Circle for the above reasons, not Blockchain.info, for just a few hundred bucks. Got 2FA on there.\n\nAnd then I keep the vast majority of my savings cold, on backed up encrypted paper wallets with keys that I generated myself offline. \n\nAgain, any key you generate with a third-party is potentially compromised. The only situation in which I'd let a third-party have a key for the majority of my wealth is when it's just 1 of 3 keys, where the other 2 are generated by me, meaning theft isn't possible without my approval.

Now, I\'ll run all this javascript code locally to turn that totally random number into a keypair (Y,Z). Now I\'ll encrypt that keypair with the user\'s password: encrypt((Y,Z) + p@ssw0rd1) = gobbledygook / cyphertext. Ok, now I\'ll send the cyphertext to Blockchain.

I figure she deserved it.": 2, 'See my other answer, but the way shops pay for gold falls into kind of a pattern. We take gold around a couple of times a year to all the places that buy gold, just to make sure we are paying more than they are. In general, broad terms, this is how places pay:\n\nCheck cashing places that also buy gold and really sketchy "We Buy Gold" places - 30% of spot\n\n"We Buy Gold" places - 40% of spot\n\nPawn shops - 50% of spot (if you are lucky)\n\nHigher end jewelry stores (in good neighborhoods) and coin shops - 50% to maybe 55% of spot (if you are lucky)\n\nSomebody paying 17% of spot would be a major outlier. Are you sure you are figuring the karat weight of the gold? If it was 10k jewelry, it would only be about 42% gold. So, if that pawn shop was buying 1.6 Pennyweight of 24k gold, it would be $100 worth of gold. If they were paying 50%, they would give her $50. If they were buying 1.6 Pennyweight of 10k gold, it would only be about $42 worth of gold. If they were paying 50%, they would only pay her $21. Spot prices are always given for 24k gold, but you don\'t find 24k gold out in the real world. It\'s always mixed with something.
