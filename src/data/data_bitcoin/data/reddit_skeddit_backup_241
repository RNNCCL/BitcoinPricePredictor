Planning for the future is a necessary requirement of a system that is to be used in the future. For example, Google having a schedule for server upgrades in the future does not mean the server upgrades are happening now.\n\n> On the one hand you say mass adoption any time now and show tables with massive tps rates, on the other hand you say 20 years. Which is it?\n\nNo one is saying mass adoption is right around the corner. If we are planning for success though (why wouldn\'t we be) then we must plan for some increase in adoption throughout time though. Adoption is not a binary process where bitcoin has either been adopted or it hasn\'t. It will occur gradually over time and often in smaller waves due to the nature of bitcoin.\n\n> 8MB in two months is enough to massively cull nodes but not for any sort of mass adoption as plain transactions in the chain. You know this, right?\n\nThere are multiple fallacies here. Firstly 8MB is a limit and not the actual block size. For almost the entire 7 years of bitcoin\'s history, blocks have not been full (but have continued to fill up over time). If the block size **limit** is increased to 8MB in 2 months it does not mean that the that the **block size** will be 8MB. We can expect blocks to fill up to the limit over time just as they have done in the past history of bitcoin.\n\nThe second is that there is no evidence that 8MB blocks will "massively cull nodes" (when 8MB blocks are reached). If someone can describe what "massively cull" means, and provide specific evidence for that this will happen, it would go towards supporting this kind of statement.\n\n>\'even with 8GB blocks, bitcoin will not be able to handle enough transactions for the whole world\'\n\nJust because bitcoin with blocks of a certain size cannot handle every possible conceivable transaction across the world does not mean it is not useful. Having larger blocks also does not mean that other solutions cannot also be implemented. Sidechains, higher layer services and off-chain services can all offer useful niche services (with tradeoffs) that bitcoin cannot. Just because bitcoin is not the be-all-and-end-all solution with bigger blocks does not mean that bigger blocks are not useful.\n\n> The mining subsidy is decreasing therefore we need to increase **individual** fees **now/in the near future** to cover this loss to make sure there is still an incentive for miners to keep mining.\n\nThe mining subsidy is decreasing (every halving) in bitcoin terms. In real terms though the subsidy has been increasing over time. You can very easily see this on this [chart](https://blockchain.info/charts/miners-revenue?timespan=all&showDataPoints=false&daysAverageString=1&show_header=true&scale=0&address=).\n\nAs bitcoin price has (much) more than doubled in the time between each halving. For example the miner revenue per day around the last block halving (50->25) was around $50,000. It is now currently at around $1,500,000. So while the block reward in bitcoin terms has decreased by 50%. The block reward in real terms has increased by around 3000%. At a certain point it is certain that the block reward will stop increasing and decrease in real terms as well, but there is no indication this will start any time soon.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThere are likely considerably more than this, so if anyone has any serious, logical fallacies (or simply falsehoods) that I haven\'t mentioned, I will gladly add them.\n\nTo have a serious debate we need to stop pushing things are based on false premises just to try and win an argument. I support BIP101 but I could certainly be convinced of a better solution if there is one, but using arguments like I have referenced to above only creates more arguments which provide no outcome other than all parties wasting time and energy.\n\n**EDIT 1:** Here\'s another one from Theymos.\n\n> As actual block sizes get larger, it becomes more and more difficult/expensive to run a full node.\n\nThis is a false premise as it ignores technological progress and the lowering of cost for technology over time. If block size increases at the same speed that the technology needed to process those blocks improves then the cost of processing each block will remain the same.\n\n**EDIT 2:** Here\'s one from BashCo.\n\n>BitcoinXT probably won\'t be the last implementation that tries to subvert consensus via hash rate. Who knows, maybe the next one will want to remove the 21 million coin limit.\n\nTwo fallacies. First, as /u/bitsko points out, this is a very clear slippery slope fallacy. There is nothing to indicate that someone who does A will do B. Using the threat of them doing B as a reason against A is the fallacy here.\n\nThe second, as /u/rezzme points out, is that you cannot attain consensus, or knowledge of consensus, without first people putting their cards on the table.\n\n**EDIT: 3** One from eragmus\n\n> As expected, zero answer to my extremely simple question (Are you claiming that Jeff Garzik is a liar or does not know what he is talking about regarding Blockstream? Yes or No.).\nlibel or slander, including your attempts at both\nI\'m not the one talking nonsense about \'Blockstream\', like you are.\nempty attempts at trying to support the destruction of bitcoin\nThis implies Jeff Garzik is also "trying to support the destruction of bitcoin".\nPeople like you will get whats coming, its already a forgone conclusion, you will be forgotten like the rest of them, your idiocy and attempts at destroying bitcoin will be remembered as a lesson.\nSo, Garzik will "get whats coming"? Garzik will "be forgotten"? Garzik has "idiocy"? Garzik "will be remembered as a lesson"?\nYou should stop your verbal diarrhea and stop foaming at the mouth, and try to realize the bullshit you\'re speaking.\n\nThese questions are completely invalid for a huge number of reasons.\n\nYou quoted two tweets from Jeff Garzik.\n\n> "Let\'s not pretend r/bitcoinxt is all sweetness and light. It\'s full of anti-Blockstream groupthink and conspiracy whispers"\n\n.\n\n> "US politics saw Bush Derangement Syndrome (attributed anything that goes wrong 2 Bush). In #bitcoin you see Blockstream Derangement Syndrome"\n\nand then you go on to present the question(s)...\n\n> Is he a liar OR does he not understand Blockstream?\n\nFirstly, off-the-bat this is a false dichotomy and the options are not mutually exclusive. Any, all or none of the statements could be true.\n\nAs to the actual content of the questions; Neither of Jeff\'s quotes are pro-blockstream. They against people being overly anti-blockstream. These are not the same thing. Also, there is nothing in his tweets that could even be a "lie" or a "truth" since all they contain is opinions. \n\nThe tweets contain nothing about Jeff\'s understanding of blockstream, only his opinion of certain people\'s opinion of blockstream.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n(If you\'re wondering why this huge post isn\'t a thread, it\'s because it was deleted and I was referred to  here by a mod.)': 19, 'So, is this just a euphemism for "No Bitcoin XT posts allowed"?\n\nI mean, I don\'t like Bitcoin XT myself, but if you\'re going to post rules, stop hiding them.': 35, 'Update: According to Ittay Eyal, \xe2\x80\x9cWe currently do not have plans to launch this as a new cyber currency or a Bitcoin fork.\xe2\x80\x9d': 4, "maybe I didn't explain myself better.

I am relatively new to Bitcoin, although I\'ve fully adopted it\'s relevance and significance!! \n\nFrom what I\'ve read thus far and from what I see, it seems that Bitcoin is facing a real and necessary challenge that is not necessarily an issue with the technology itself but our limited ability to enable critical thinking and understanding the unknown as human species.\n\nIf we can just acknowledge a few things, it would go a long way...."Human wisdom begins with the recognition of one\'s own ignorance" Socrates and "No problem can be solved from the same level of consciousness that created it" Albert Einstein\n\nI am by no means advocating I have the answer but that\'s the point, realizing nobody does. Hindsight is 20/20 and what better way than to collectively figure this thing out. After all isn\'t that what open source is meant to be.....the system as whole is very strong, inherently balanced as nature itself is.\n\nHave faith in Bitcoin, it can handle much more than what society assumes or pretends to know. Change is often very hard, although evolution thrives on it. As an outsider, looking in, I see these challenges as progress, not as an end as some would suggest. Where there is life, there is growth, action and awareness.\n\nI believe Bitcoin has embarked on what it was ultimately meant to do.....enable and empower society to do phenomenal things and more importantly, truly bringing us together, inspiring one thought, one mind, one action.\n\n"Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world, indeed it\'s the only thing that ever has." Margaret Mead': 2, 'I think it is also important to point out that lots of people seem to get confused about what consensus means in the context of distributed consensus. There were some comments by people (Mike and other BIP101 promoters) complaining that a soft forks code would be merged and occur when the core devs wouldn\'t merge hard forking consensus code.\n\nThe thing is, a soft fork retains consensus and a hard fork doesn\'t. This is constantly questioned, and people complain that Bitcoin Core supposedly doesn\'t retain consensus with very early Bitcoin versions, and should be called an altcoin because of it. The thing though, is that it does.\n\nThe usual complaint is something like "I didn\'t approve of the 1MB blocksize reduction" or "I didn\'t approve of P2SH", therefore it doesn\'t have consensus. The problem with that thinking is that even if your client didn\'t recognize those changes, you would **still be in consensus**. \n\nLet\'s remember what staying in consensus means, you are in agree with the other Bitcoin users about which blockchain is the tallest valid blockchain. So, if all miners say, for a simple example, "we will no longer accept OP_RETURN transactions", you wouldn\'t lose consensus, you would just be fed exclusively blocks that didn\'t have OP_RETURN. So saying a miners decision about what to or to not include in their block "didn\'t have your consensus" is nonsensical because you don\'t decide what they put in their block beyond the limitations set in block validity rules.': -11, "While you're *probably* correct in this statement due to BashCo's use of language, who knows, maybe your next statement will want to remove the 21 million coin limit.": 10, 'This thread was temporarly replaced by the "[Can we be sober for a second?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3rd4i5/can_we_be_sober_for_a_second/)" because it\'s an important read during such an incredible rally.\n\n': 3, "Not sure why, but it's added now.

Can we really imagine that Satoshi didn\xe2\x80\x99t realize that an address formed with a SHA-256 hash takes up 256/8 = 32 bytes of space?\n\nNot bloody likely.\n\nIt then suddenly struck me that this is a strategically placed hurdle, which Satoshi placed on purpose in front of us to jump over at this time in the progression of this living organism, and for which we must develop the community governance \xe2\x80\x9cmuscles\xe2\x80\x9d to clear.\nForming the toolkit and process necessary to address this issue at this stage is perfect timing, since we have critical mass of adoption and the user base is still technical enough to allow a hard fork without much potential for disruption of end users in the wild during the transition.\n\nIn addition, we can think of the block size issue as equivalent to a gardener facing how much to water a plant, given that too much water could suffocate the roots and develop root rot or fungi, but then again the soil cannot be allowed to run dry.\n\nOne classic limitation to be considered in the design of all distributed systems is the capacity for inter-node communication between the far ends of the network, which depends on the bandwidth and latency characteristics of the network, equivalent to the soil medium\xe2\x80\x99s characteristics in our plant analogy.\n\nSo just as if you were to entrust your gardener to add a variable amount of water to your plants if you leave for a number of years, rather than prescribing a set watering schedule, Satoshi left the sprinklers on a default and safe setting, not knowing how the soil (network) would evolve in the coming years.\n\nSo let\xe2\x80\x99s forget the pejorative \xe2\x80\x9csmall blockers\xe2\x80\x9d vs. \xe2\x80\x9cmega blockers\xe2\x80\x9d, or overwaterers vs. underwaterers.\n\nWe can all agree that the garden sometimes needs watering, that block size must strike a fine balance to accommodate scaling of transactions per second vs. the need for distant distributed nodes to communicate without undue burden.\n\nOur community working through this together takes care of two birds with one stone.\n': 3, 'I thought I had a huge issue...deleted, thought, reformatted, then deleted again because the issue was self correcting': 2, "You and I both know that's not true.
