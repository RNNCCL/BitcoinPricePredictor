I wonder why they didn\'t print a QR on the receipt at least to be able to scan.\n\nHaving both a software development background and having worked fast food about a year in total as a sort of working vacation from the cube, I cannot understand why they would design the system like that. There must be other communication going on already over the network connection they both have so that the transaction id alone suffices. Which means that typing anything in should be superfluous. They should just do it as the usual cash payment screen, where it would show the pending orders to be paid and the right one is selected. Except even easier because, really, how many pending Bitcoin payments are there typically, so the "only one pending" base case comes into play more option where it can already know what order is to be paid, so it could just show the QR code on the auxiliary system immediately after the Bitcoin payment method is selected on the main system and notification is sent automagically over the network to the auxiliary system.\n\nAnd then if it\'s really busy with Bitcoin customers, there\'s just a list to select from first on the pad to indicate which ticket. Usually it\'ll be the one at the top (oldest notification of Bitcoin payment which is still unpaid), but in some instances it may vary. It could even still default to the first notification in that case and have the user scroll through, if the first notification is it often enough.\n\nGiven that the user flow is going to be: person at the window/teller already when they decide their payment method, I think this will actually be pretty synchronous and the idea of selecting between multiple transactions to pay is probably superfluous itself.\n\ntl;dr: Armchair coder says it\'s a bad design that the cashier has to type in the transaction id from the paper receipt manually. Whoever wrote that is either an asshole, or at the very least, never spent a day working in fast food.\n\nEdit: So long as one simply pairs the main terminal and the particular individual pad, of course. So at worst, one id to type in each time switching the pad between registers in order to not have to type an id for each transaction. And even without that, as long as paired to store, should be relatively well-ordered still. Race condition is something like: single pad for multiple registers, Alice and Bob both have customers paying by Bitcoin. Alice presses the button first but Bob already has the pad. Alice\'s customer payment is now up by default, so Bob must scroll to the next entry before having the customer pay the QR code, or Bob\'s customer will pay the bill for Alice\'s customer accidentally.': 1, "I'm in Brielle NL now and last night when I check in the hotel at 2300 and ask for food they toll me to use this site: thuisbezorgd.nl and for surprise they accept bitcoins. \n": 3, '*boestin* received a tip for 700 bits ($0.30).\n\n\n\n\n--\n\n[^^what ^^is ^^ChangeTip?](https://www.reddit.com/r/changetip/wiki/tipping-on-reddit)': 1, "Get your goddamn coffee shop transactions out of My beautiful interbank settlement network.
