In addition, it clearly pointed the finger at the legislature and recommended writing extra flexibility for cryptocurrencies into the laws.\n\n> Each time some new technology comes along that massively disrupts things entrenched interests try to fight it\n\nYet in the case of Estonia, the government and legislature have clearly understood that fighting the tide isn\'t sensible and flexibility and early adoption result in success. A good case in point from the current year: both the government and the Tax Board have embraced Uber and other ride-sharing services and are accommodating these services into the laws and tax code. Not only that, the Tax Board is developing innovative technical solutions to allow paying all applicable taxes on the fly without any bureaucracy whatsoever. Contrast this with many other European nations where there have been riots on the streets against Uber and governments have clamped down in response.\n\nI don\'t understand the dramatic tone in this thread. The court didn\'t rule that cryptocurrencies are banned or subject to excessive, undue regulation; but that cryptocurrencies are subject to the same regulation as other "alternative means of payment" (a very clearly defined term in the [Money Laundering Law](https://www.riigiteataja.ee/en/eli/514032016003/consolide)).

For example, they may be abusing government tech development subsidies, they may be hiding their true hashing power in other pools, not following investment regulations, I think it's a good bet that they aren't following all the regulations in China because very few companies over there do.

That being said, we should not forget that Bitcoin has other unique properties - it is censorship free - it is complete alternative to current corrupted financial systems, it's global & inclusive. It's freedom. I am sure people will come with new ways how to use Bitcoin in their businesses.\n\nIf you don't mind a question - where are you from, Anna?": 1, "Hello Anna.

Bitcoin is in progress on the field and will be adapted fully, when the financial market will collapse.  I think this will be anytime soon. The old system is on the brick of destruction, and the financial market does do everything to exploit it further and take out the furniture out of the fire. But there is no doubt, it is collapsing due to a huge ponzi scheme and debt.\n\nI forsee by the end of 2016 (or close to that period) there will be huge shifts and changes. So to all Governments, their Secret Services, my Hack and Code friends, Anonymous,  cDc, Indignados, P2P geeks, nutty professors, grumpy coders and activists, who do like to read my posts, You are warned about this: 'Do prepare to shift your assets to a safe garden.' The panama papers are only the top of the mess, and You do known it! Move to a safe garden and I say, it IS bitcoin partly, gold partly. Don't be too late to find out, Your fiat currency is worse as toilet paper.\n\nIt is perfectly possible, to maintain bitcoin in a safe manner with technology such as Trezor (hardware) wallets, use other accounts for business and to redraw money with debit cards such as Xapo or Bit-X.\n\nMerchants can convert regular fiat currency in bitcoin with brookers such as localbitcoins, bitstamp, etc.\n\nHowever, people and business often put their fiat currency as measurement for the value of bitcoin.  Same is done with gold.  This is often due to common behavior. However. You can only measure something properly, if You do not forge the scale to measure something.  This is obviously done with fiat currency.  More about this, see youtube, 'Money as Debt' which can serve Your investigation.\n\nSoon You will see, people and business will put GOLD or BITCOIN (or alike) as measurement, base for ALL fiat currency.  Because You can not mess with gold or bitcoin. You can't make it out of the blue.\n\nWe have a habbit to use fiat currency (such as the dollar) as base to measure the value of something.  I expect this will change in future.  People need to have something more honest, suitable as this.  Not something bank and governments can alter on the back of people, to print for free money, both take a part from the printed stack, distribute the other part to the economy.  And finally, well, You are robbed in the wallet.  As You will see You can buy less for the same amount of money (due to additional printed money).  This is robbery, fraud.\n\nFiat currency is a belief system and it works until people loose their belief, trust. Fiat currency is a note, a certificate of an asset that should be gold.  A note for a deposit. But the deposit is....gone !  \n\nThere is actually no real problem in terms of business.  You can perfectly book bitcoins.  You only need to add a 'foreign' currency to Your accountancy program and print out the balance sheets.\n\nHowever I can understand the governments do look to this with scared eyes. There is no need to ! At the contrary, it can free them from the dominance and slavery from (central, national, private) banks.\n\nBut as I stated.  In future all will change.  \n\nIt is actually possible to raise up a small tax on every (bitcoin) transaction.  Such as the proposed Tobin taxation. This tax can be redistributed in a small part to governments to make them functional, to large part should be distributed to single-owner-only, personalized and individualized wallets, so to speak one wallet for one person, to raise up an unconditional basic income, to create a social income to ALL PEOPLE on this world. This will ditch poverty ! Take a way from people the fear to fall without income, to the need to survive.This will increase creativity, business, more, it will create added value business that will be in balance with nature. That will not run in a destructive way.  As there will be a base of income ! As it will balance out a lot of things. IF, it is adapted.\n\nSo each transaction of bitcoin CAN, if people allow, trigger income for the governments AND all people to ditch poverty and to help our governments to be FREE from their slavery of the banks.  As they are slaves as well, just like You and me, from the loan masters, the banks.\n\nSo I do belief, bitcoin, or a cryptocurrency alike, will be the future. it will be the general scale, measurement for money and each transaction will lead to income for state and all people.  Doing business will become again valuable, fun, good to do and an added value, because there will be basic income ! The rich will do a lot of transactions but help with their transactions all others by the tobin taxed traffic. \n\nSo this is what I see, actually soon, in future.\n\nI would say to You, as people wait, until I come forward and present my proof to the world about my real identity, I show here, which I will do soon I fixed my issues, but is actually not that important but my invention and my spread of information, but some want, so I try...which is only be done, to come forward with my PGP key 5EC948A1 (wait-to-use-for-now-until ready) - 4997BEC5 (use-temporary) !!! I repeat !!! To stop all others once for all to hoax. And I hope I can do it so I can reward some people who did do a lot for bitcoin and it's workout.\nAs I did promise.

Due to the cancer and related heart problems, Byrne says, he has undergone more than 106 surgeries over the last three decades. And in the last year, he has battled a recurrence of Hepatitis C, which he first contracted on a visit to China in the early \xe2\x80\x9980s. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been really gutting it out over the past few months,\xe2\x80\x9d he says.\n\nHis decision to take a leave of absence from Overstock\xe2\x80\x94a cut-rate online retailer based in Salt Lake City, Utah\xe2\x80\x94will be felt most among the worldwide community working to advance bitcoin and the bitcoin blockchain, the vast digital ledger that underpins the digital currency. Guided by Byrne, Overstock was the first major retailer to accept payments in bitcoin, and perhaps more importantly, he led the creation of an Overstock subsidiary called T\xc3\x98.com, which uses the blockchain and related technologies to build services that can track the exchange of financial securities.\n\nIn discussing his leave, Byrne expresses little worry over the health of Overstock, but shows considerable remorse because he is unable to continue his work with the blockchain, referring to its rise as an \xe2\x80\x9cextinction event\xe2\x80\x9d for the financial industry.\n\nRunning atop a network of independent machines spread across the globe, the blockchain was originally built to oversee the exchange of money, using cryptographic algorithms to verify transactions. But it can also track the exchange of anything else that carries value\xe2\x80\x94including stocks, bonds, futures, and other financial securities\xe2\x80\x94and thanks to those same cryptographic algorithms, it can do so without the oversight of any one central institution. Much as the blockchain can drive a money system outside the control of any one government, it can also juggle stock outside the control of any one bank.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt provides a database that can be shared by multiple entities who have different economic or political agendas and therefore don\xe2\x80\x99t necessary trust each other,\xe2\x80\x9d says Gideon Greenspan, the CEO and founder of Coin Sciences, another company that\xe2\x80\x99s exploring blockchain applications that extend beyond bitcoin. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s no central gatekeeper checking all transactions that come in, saying what\xe2\x80\x99s valid and what\xe2\x80\x99s not.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIn many ways, Byrne has aimed to remake Wall Street.\n\nByrne and Overstock started work on their blockchain system almost two years ago, and this past December, after months of back and forth, the SEC approved the company\xe2\x80\x99s plan to offer public shares via the blockchain. The idea is that the company can issue shares without the help of Wall Street. Byrne envisions other companies IPO-ing through the same system\xe2\x80\x94going public in a more democratic way. But this system can handle other assets, too. Overstock has already issued private bonds on the system, and T\xc3\x98 has built a separate service that oversees stock loans.\n\nMany others are exploring similar technology\xe2\x80\x94even some within Wall Street establishment. Nasdaq OMX, the company behind the Nasdaq public exchange, is building a system that uses the blockchain to oversee the market for stock in companies that are still private. And a wide range of big-name banks and tech companies have put their weight behind an open-source project called the Open Ledger Project, or Hyperledger, which aims to build new software that operates much like the blockchain. But Byrne has long been out in front of this online revolution. In many ways, his efforts have aimed to remake Wall Street, and now, the big Wall Street names are trying to remake themselves before they get left behind.\n\nByrne has a long history of pushing for reform on Wall Street. Overstock was among the first companies that went public under what\xe2\x80\x99s called a Dutch Auction, which lets the market set the price for an IPO, not some big Wall Street bank. In working to offer stock over the blockchain, the company is taking this idea even further.\n\nHis leave of absence casts some doubt over Overstock\xe2\x80\x99s blockchain ambitions. But Byrne says he will recommend that general counsel Mitch Edwards, who had been closely involved with the development of T\xc3\x98, now serve as the company\xe2\x80\x99s interim CEO. Byrne feels a certain sadness that he will not be part of effort for the foreseeable future, but he\xe2\x80\x99s adamant that Overstock\xe2\x80\x99s effort will continue apace. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve worked really hard,\xe2\x80\x9d he says, \xe2\x80\x9cto get this revolution going in the right direction.\xe2\x80\x9d': 15, 'you are in our thoughts and prayers': 2, 'Best wishes, Patrick.': 2, "This is truly a terrible blow to our community.

First of all "inefficeint" is a relative position. Mining equipment has (and will continue to) become more energy efficient with each new generation. What some might call "inefficient" today is dramatically more efficient than just a few years ago. Secondly, "equally secure" would imply having equally decentralized hashing equipment and having equal hashing power.

There are at least two ways to consider off-chain transaction processing.\n\nOne is that you could consider the blockchain to be a means of settling disputes, such that if any sequence of bitcoin transactions off-chain (such as [Lightning Network](https://lightning.network/) bitcoin transaction sequence) is under dispute, the transactions could be relayed to the bitcoin p2p network and undergo final settlement according to the transcript scripts. Under this scenario, the question you would have to ask is: would the rate of dispute be high enough to support the bitcoin network? Would there be enough dispute such that transactions are broadcast to the network every 10 minutes enough to support bitcoin mining? If you are an optimist, then you would think perhaps not-- maybe the whole network runs pretty well and only has one or two transactions once in a while that are disputed and need to be settled to the Bitcoin blockchain. Would mining equipment sit idle and wait for the transactions to be relayed over the network? And would this be sufficient incentive.\n\nThe second aspect to consider is that on-chain settlement has some distinct benefits like the increasingly-hard-to-reverse nature of a transaction buried under additional confirmations. Suppose, here, that there are no disputed transactions from the first scenario. Would there be any reason to relay transactions to the bitcoin network? The primary reason to relay transactions would be for long-term cold storage. Users that wish to store BTC while going offline would prefer to store BTC in the blockchain. Users that are planning on spending their BTC would also relay transactions to the p2p network. So far, developers working on Lightning Network have thought mostly about LN for small payments and small amounts of BTC because of the inherent security concerns of having a "hot wallet" (private keys loaded in memory, signing bitcoin transactions). Larger amounts of BTC should be in "cold storage" in the blockchain and should not be controlled by private keys loaded into memory to network-connected devices (such as LN or bitcoin nodes).\n\nRe: mining efficiency and whether certain changes would be desirable, I recommend reading https://download.wpsoftware.net/bitcoin/asic-faq.pdf and https://download.wpsoftware.net/bitcoin/pos.pdf and https://download.wpsoftware.net/bitcoin/alts.pdf': 3}, ('Is Bitcoin Legal In India? - The Asian Entrepreneur', 0): {}, ('Dedicated servers > 2x CPU > 4x CPU > GPU servers > Custom Solutions > We accept BITCOINS', 3): {}, ('How Bitcoin Revived the Cypherpunk Revolution', 3): {}, ('New Blockchain Community in Barcelona', 3): {'So is this to only talk about the blockchain and no other aspects of Bitcoin?\n\nOr is it to talk about the permissioned ledgers banks are planning to deploy in a couple of years?\n': 2, "There was no 'Linked List' community before?": 3, 'Is to talk about every interesting thing related with the blockchain technology :)': 0}, ('Wired: "How to Prove You\xe2\x80\x99re Bitcoin Creator Satoshi Nakamoto"', 32): {"I don't have to do any of that.

One key that Coinkite also stores, but is encrypted with a strong password that I control. The third key is in cold storage.

Using your own suggestion, "use your phone", you don\'t know if one of my 2fa keys is on my phone therefor ensuring you need to have both of my devices to access my wallet. \n\nI do realize that coinkite is different to copay, but I think copay still has a lot of work to reach a usability level that coinkite is at.

Again, as I pointed out originally, there is some mix up here of the term "route"  in the internet connected sense and "route" as in the open payment channel sense.\n\nYes if everyone is broadcasting their payment channels to everyone else payment channel routes can be found between parties. This has the privacy implications that I also mentioned above but you didn\'t respond to.\n\nI\'m sorry to be so critical of your responses as you are obviously trying to help. Probably I am just misunderstanding most of what you are trying to say. Maybe we should just agree that we can\'t really communicate and move on :(': 1, "Maybe you are concerned about finding the precise UTXO given only node IDs?\n\nThere could be multiple channels between any two given nodes, but in the example Amy -> N1 -> N2 -> B I assumed for simplicity that there would only be one channel between each pair of nodes. It doesn't really matter much for the example.\n\nThe real identity of a channel would be the txid + output index specifying the UTXO holding the money. This identity cannot be computed by a simple formula from the node IDs (here represented by the strings 'Amy', 'N1', 'N2', 'N3', 'B', 'Bob') as both sides would choose brand new keys to control it. But both sides of a channel would of course know the node ID of the counterparty on the other side of the channel. So leaving them out of the notation is good enough for our purposes here.\n\nBeacons announce the fact that they are beacons to the nodes they currently have channels open with.\n\nB: Hey N2, I'm now a beacon!\n\nN2: (tells its own neighbours about its route to B)\n\nN2: Hey N1, I've now got a route to a beacon, namely N2 -> B.\n\nN1: (tells its own neighbours about its route to B)\n\nN1: Hey Amy, I've now got a route to a beacon, namely N1 -> N2 -> B.\n\n--> Amy now knows of a route Amy -> N1 -> N2 -> B.\n\nA similar story holds for Bob.\n\nDoes this help?": 1, "> I explained one such mechanism using beacons...\n\nI think maybe you are talking at a higher level or assuming some greater base knowledge here of what has been discussed on lightning routing. I don't know what you mean by routes. I can't tell if you are talking internet routes, payment channel routes, or both at the same time. You didn't comment really on my proposal except to say that you explained one such mechanism. Not trying to be harsh here, just trying to understand.\n\nI think my suggestion works, but has privacy issues. Is there a  proposal on the table that gets around these privacy issues? I didn't really see that in your suggestion and it was at too high a level to understand the low level details. Maybe give an example like mine.\n": 2, 'The suggestion so far was to use beacon nodes that are periodically selected by a pseudo-random process. Neighbour nodes of the beacon nodes would broadcast their shortest route to their neighbours who would broadcast to their neighbours etc. Every time a node learns a better path to a beacon node, it would broadcast that too. Very soon every node that was reachable from a beacon node would learn the shortest paths to its reachable nodes. Two nodes that share a reachable node could then construct a path. Routing would not be limited to these paths running through beacons and you could continue to use old beacons. The beacon system is just an efficient algorithm to find paths between arbitrary nodes. Rusty has recently referred to the beacons as landmarks, which may be a better name.': 9, "I think we need to dive a level deeper here.\n\nLightning payment channels are essentially (AFIK) multisig 2of2 transactions on the blockchain. So yes if everyone is broadcasting at some point all their payment channel output addresses and identifying them with some common unique identifier, then a route can be found. Maybe that identifier is an IP address or maybe it is just some random GUID.\n\nExample.\n\n    BobUnique3439 channels: addr: 14F4F..., 339FE..., 930ACD... (these are truncated bitcoin addresses that are payment channel output addresses)\n    MkeUnique9091 channels: addr: D93EE...,339FE..., 9300AEE...\n    AmyUnique3939 channels: addr:  AACED...,ABC83...,D93EE... \n\nSo here we can see that Amy has a route to Bob. She has channel D93EE with Mike who then has channel 339FE with Bob.\n\nThe downside of this is that everyone has to make it known what all their channels are and group them by some unique identifier. Certainly names like Amy and Bob don't have to be used, but still this seems like a privacy leak to me.\n\nThe above is just my guesswork about how payments could be routed. Hopefully smarter minds have found a way to preserve more privacy than the above technique.\n\n\n": 2, "Suppose Amy wants to send 0.3BTC to Bob. Amy knows a route of payment channels to a beacon node B: Amy -> N1 -> N2 -> B. Bob also knows a route to B: Bob -> N3 -> B. Amy can now concatenate her own route to B with the reverse of Bob's route: Amy -> N1 -> N2 -> B -> N3 -> Bob.\n\nBoth Bob and Amy can efficiently obtain routes to B because newly elected beacons announce their presence to their neighbours (or these neighbours detect them themselves), who then announce their shortest route to the beacon to their neighbours, who prepend the channel over which they received the announcement, and announce the resulting route to their neighbours if it's better than the previous route if any.": 1, "Ok, but to know any of this, everyone has to announce their payment channel output addresses and identify them as belonging to the same entity. \n\nHow does Amy know of the N1->N2 route? These have to be announced. N1 needs to identify channels belonging to them, where a channel is just an output address on the blockchain. N2 also needs to do this. They will announce the same address, thus the discovery is made. Otherwise how does Amy know about the channel between N1 and N2? So is that the kind of announcement that you are talking about? \n\nI really can't tell if we are on the same page here or not, seems like we are close. You mentioned announcing presence whereas I'm talking about announcing payment channel addresses. Can you explain how announcing presence will let me know if you have a payment channel open with another person (a person that controls a private key to sign transactions that are part of a payment channel)?": 1, 'Wait, don\'t we need an open "channel route" though?\n\nChannel route (my term) ==> Amy wants to send Bob bitcoins, she doesn\'t have an open channel with Bob but has an open channel with another. A "Channel route" is needed to send Bob bitcoins by routing through Amy\'s open channel, then from that node to one of its open channels, and so on to Bob.\n\nSo how do we route to Bob? Unless Bob identifies all his open channels as "Bob\'s channel" (could be any unique identifier used for all his channels), and everyone else also has their channels marked as such, then I\'m not sure how it is done.\n': 1, 'I explained one such mechanism using beacons in this very conversation.

This includes increasing the number of full nodes and adding fraud proofs to the network so that lightweight nodes know when the longest chain is actually invalid. If all lightweight nodes used fraud proofs, Bitcoin would be massively more secure because it would be extremely difficult for miners to trick anyone into accepting an invalid chain which creates too much BTC, steals BTC, etc.\n\nAfter fraud proofs, the remaining problems are double-spending and transaction censorship. For example, the Chinese government could right now require that all Bitcoin users submit identity info in order to use Bitcoin, since the majority of miners are in China, and they can censor whatever transactions they want. That's a big problem. I think that the only way to make miners unlikely to do this, and to handle things if they do, is to be willing and ready as a community to immediately change the PoW if the majority of miners engage in this stuff.\n\nMore speculatively: Assuming that someone can design a PoW algorithm that won't give ASICs any advantage over desktop machines (despite what you may have heard, it is not at all clear whether this is actually possible), I think that it might be an improvement to change the PoW so that:\n\n* If the block height mod 3 = 0, the current PoW is used.\n* If the block height mod 3 = 1, the ASIC-resistant PoW is used.\n* If the block height mod 3 = 2, some sort of proof-of-stake is used.

Finney is gone (for now!) and so since any of these men know how strong the conjecture must be to hold it makes sense to me he took many of the secrets with him.\n\nI think then I only need to suggest Finney was meditating on Nash's works since the early 2000's: http://extropians.weidai.com/extropians.1Q02/3146.html\n\n>I've just started reading Sylvia Nasar's biography of mathematician John\nNash, A Beautiful Mind, on which the current movie is based.
