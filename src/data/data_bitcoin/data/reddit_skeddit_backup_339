The profit margin (mark-up) on this share-lending activity is upwards of 1000% according to Byrne, and this type of activity accounts for 40%+ of profits for brokerages like Goldman Sachs (according to Byrne).  This exchange will cut out the brokerages as the middle men and will create a market that will directly connect short sellers and share holders who are willing to loan their shares out to hedge funds, traders, etc for short-selling.  This will allow shareholders to earn more money for loaning out their shares on the exchange (as opposed to loaning them to the brokerage and getting a pittance for it), and save short sellers money because there won't be a middle man marking up the price to borrow the shares.

What the ratio between the limit and broadband availability should be is a major point of debate. Gavin's proposal says 8 MB to today's level of broadband deployment.

When visa moves around dollars they are moving around abstractions of dollars, not true dollars (which arguably no longer even exist)\n\nBitcoin works the same way, there are slow ways of moving on the main network and fast ways of working that are on other networks. \n\nThe Bitcoin network scales by delaying less important traffic. This encourages the least important traffic to always stay off chain on other networks and ensures that traffic is serviced in order of importance\n\nThis process is in place today and most Bitcoin traffic is already on 3rd party networks. In fact there's no reason visa couldn't handle Bitcoin on their own system": 1, 'Satoshi talked about how this could be resolved:\n\nhttp://satoshi.nakamotoinstitute.org/emails/cryptography/2/\n\nHowever, there is a lot of concern in the Bitcoin tech community about the health of the network with throughput levels that high, so the proposals for scaling now all call for the block size limit to be increased at the same rate as broadband growth, in order to scale without compromising decentralization of full nodes.

": 3, '> "I assumed that the attacker would double spend..."\n\nThat\'s certainly an option.  Of course, large scale double-spends will quickly out a 51% pool as being such, leading to distrust and collapse of the currency.  This is definitely an option for the malicious attacker who\'s goal isn\'t to profit, but to destroy.\n\n\nFor your average attacker, the profit model for them would be to continue to milk the 3600btc per day reward.  I would estimate 2 weeks (1 month tops) before all remaining miners would either point their hashing power to the dominant pool, or drop out.  With the difficulty re-targeting, and the competition out, the dominant pool could continue to lower their hashing rate (cutting on their power bill) reaping further profits.\n\nA dominant mining pool doing as such would be likely to keep their users (us) very happy, until their domination is firmly secured.  At that point, transaction fees would likely increase.\n\nBitcoin is an amazing breakthrough in so many ways, it\'s tough to grapple with, but we shouldn\'t overlook its problems.\n\n> "in the year 2040 the transaction fees is probably the only thing that keeps miners to the network."\n\nYep!\n\n\n*Again:  I\'m not an expert though, so all of this is just MHO.*': 1, 'He would destroy bitcoin for 10 minutes': 0, "A 51% attack can easily happen, even without malicious intent.  As miners put more and more hashing power online, they're not exactly aware of what other mining pools are putting online at the same time.\n\nIt's kind of a poisson distribution problem.  If one of the major pools were to receive their latest shipment of new asics, (say it was an order of 10,000 mining rigs) running at the highest level of efficiency currently available, they may inadvertently reach 51%.  Further compounding this problem is that the data (and popular pie-charts) describing the current hashing distribution is really not that accurate, and as always there's a high degree of variance based on the mechanics of finding blocks.\n\nWhen ghash.io appeared to have greater than 51% control, it's unlikely they actually did, outside of the standard variance that temporarily pushed them over the 51% mark.\n\nIf any pool reaches a true majority, it will build a positive feedback loop further solidifying their control.

But this cuts both ways.  \n\nGetting a bad actor off the network would require the remaining miners and nodes to work in unison to manually block IPs, creating a game of cat and mouse, as the bad actor would jump from IP to IP.

If this happens, the pool will begin receiving most block awards, and eventually all block awards.  Other mining pools will be forced to drop out.  It's unlikely we (users) would even be aware of this happening as the pool can disguise itself under several names and IPs.\n\nMy guess is that such a pool would take considerable measures to maintain their privacy (as some pools already do) and to best satisfy their customers (we, users), by offering very low or free transaction costs and timely propagation.  At the current price of bitcoin, such a mining pool would be earning about $1m per day.\n\nOnce their mining competition dropped out, they could effectively lower the difficulty rate, raising their ROI considerably by providing *just enough* difficulty to make it not worth it for competition to enter the space.

It was set up in the 1960\'s or so, when the volume of paper stock certificates moving from broker to broker was starting to overwhelm their back offices.  So instead of moving the certificates around, they stay in the vault, and computers track who owns how many shares.  They put all the Apple (AAPL) shares in a pile, and each broker has title to X of them.  In turn, the broker credits each of their customer accounts with however many shares they are supposed to have.  It\'s a two tier system.  \n\nThe shares are registered in the name of the broker.  This is called "Street name", meaning Wall Street broker.  Any trades that can be settled among customers of the same broker just require updating the broker\'s database.  If the net buy or sell is unbalanced, the broker goes to the exchange to trade with someone else.  \n\nA stock certificate is just a fancy piece of paper that has a serial number, how many shares, and who owns them.  It\'s a duplicate of the information kept by the corporate registrar (part of the official paperwork of the company).  They need to keep track of who their owners are in order to send reports, dividends, and meeting notices.  Before computers, you sold shares by writing the new owner\'s name and info on the back, sending the certificate back to the registrar, and they would send out a new certificate to the new owner.

There are web wallets that have different alert mechanisms (email, sms, etc.), but on the bitcoin network itself there would appear a transaction stating that some amount of "bitcoin" is transferred from the original wallet to some other wallet.\n\nThis transaction would appear instantly, but it would need to propagate throughout the bitcoin network, with nodes confirming its validity as they see it. Usually people don\'t consider transactions to be truly effective until at least three nodes verify them as correct, so depending on your monitoring service you could get informed a bit sooner or a bit later.\n\nSince all this is public, you could trace the transactions back to some origin, or if you know a certain transaction was a robbery, you could trace them forward to see what wallet ends up with the balance. Problem is, wallets are anonymous and very easy to create, so most probably you wouldn\'t be able to determine who the culprit was, or even which wallet(s) is(are) his.': 1, '2FA on a wallet, email notifications turned on when receiving/sending transactions.': 1, 'OK, a more specific question, if you had X bitcoins and you put them somewhere public, how would you know if someone had "taken" them?': 1}, ("So that's lame!

In the end, these UDP based experimental protocols may simply influence new versions of TCP and thus make switching away from SSH not important at all.\n\n\nSince TCP getting fixed is likely a long term possibility, I may be adding additional support in a nearer term for such a low level transport. However, in my evaluation (and the authors of the protocols themselves), none of them are ready yet; so in the interest of getting a fully functional MORPHiS out the door, I went with what I calculated after much evaluation of many possibilities to be the best protocol out there, and that is SSH. I have improved the SSH protocol significantly for my purposes, while remaining 100% compatible with OpenSSH. I am quite happy with the results of this decision. However, due to the inherent ICMP reset vulnerability that TCP has, I absolutely am looking forward to the future with my eye on such developments.\n\n\nOne further improvement that is slated to be made to the SSH protocol by me is the ability to resume a connection without any renegotiation needed.

EDIT: her message\nincludes her e, ie: {encrypted_data, e}.\n\nAlice increments a noonce in the header of the TargetedBlock that wraps \nthe DmailWrapper that wraps the encrypted Dmail.

The \nwrapper also includes the TARGET_KEY so that the Dmail has to be \ntargeted to one address.\n\nThe network stores the dmail pretty much the same as any static upload, \nexcept that it also keeps track of the TARGET_ID in the TargetedBlock \n(wraps the DmailWrapper which wraps the encrypted Dmail).

Please could you expand on your views the economics of Bitcoin heaters a bit more.  This is still an area which continues to confuse me, to some extent.\n\nLet\xe2\x80\x99s assume that the marginal cost of heating your home is $10 per day.  The marginal benefit of heating the home is zero in the summer and then gradually increases, peaking at $50 in the middle of the winter.  One only turns the heater on for periods in the winter when the marginal benefit is greater than $10 per day.\n\nLet\xe2\x80\x99s then assume that you make a one off capital investment and convert the heating system into a Bitcoin mining heating system.  Let us also assume the heater is \xe2\x80\x9c100% energy efficient\xe2\x80\x9d, this is probably a reasonable assumption, as in theory all the energy is ultimately is given off as heat (We will ignore factors such particles changing structure).  The system still costs $10 a day, has two settings (on and off) and is expected to mine $1 worth of bitcoin per day when switched on.  The benefit curve over time, of heating the house remains unchanged.\n\nWith this new heating system, it is now switched on for a slightly longer period, which is when the marginal benefit is greater than the marginal cost, now only $9 per day ($10 minus $1), compared to $10 per day for the old non Bitcoin mining system.  During this $9 to $10 range, there is a small marginal cost of mining Bitcoin.  Once the benefit of heating increases above $10, the marginal cost of mining bitcoin could be considered as zero.  Is this a reasonable way of looking at it or should the cost be split between the benefits of a warmer house and the bitcoin, pro rata according to benefits?  If the marginal cost of mining is zero, does this have any impact on mining economics?  \n\nThe resulting economics could ultimately depend on the comparative size between global Bitcoin mining revenue and global surplus heating benefits, admittedly both of these change unpredictably and dynamically over time.  If surplus global heating benefits are significantly higher than Bitcoin mining revenue (probably likely), then there could be a small number of dedicated commercial miners and most of the miners could mine bitcoin with a zero marginal cost.  This could be a security risk, since there is limited marginal cost involved and the benefits to each miner could be minimal, miners could be less interested in the security of the network and could allow various vulnerabilities to be exploited.  \n\nFor example, in the above scenario, in any given day, if the heater has a $50 benefit of a warmer house, generates $1 worth of bitcoin and costs $10 in electricity expense, bitcoin only represents 1/41 of the net benefit of turning the mining equipment on and the miner may not care sufficiently about Bitcoin security. \n\nPlease let me know your thoughts.\n': 5, 'To speak generally about the future for a moment, as a cryptocurrency increases in importance, it will have a bigger network of people who depend on it, which I think will keep [4] very high (for either PoW or PoS or just about anything else).': 1, "Just trying to stop people from using my work to take people's money.": 10, 'I think that is right.

The article only showed that the total financial cost of proof-of-work will rise to equal the block reward. Part of that cost is the amortized capital expense of mining equipment. This is not equivalent to energy, since different products require different amounts of energy to for a given economic value.\n\nIt seems likely that the total energy consumed to create mining equipment is less than if the purchase price were used entirely for electricity, which means if miners buy more expensive equipment that uses less energy, Bitcoin's total energy expense will drop. Or if the waste heat from the chip is used to heat your house, the mining cost will be almost entirely capital.": 1, "> you appreciate how it works it but in spite of yourself you are still irrationally against it. \n\nYou don't think this is jumping to conclusions a bit here?": 5, "Well, there are a lot of things still being finalized for Casper so until that happens I can't really comment about this.": 2, 'Quality post right there.

At some point in the last decade people got very interested in the concept of peak oil (peak in the sense peak of production), which was a kind of nuance on the more basic concept that oil is finite.\n\nThen a lot of people started cross-applying the concept, e.g. "peak copper". But peak copper makes no sense, because when copper is used it is not *consumed*. Previously used copper can be recycled; one can argue it\'s much more expensive to recycle than mine, but that doesn\'t alter the basic fact that copper doesn\'t disappear. On the other hand, if one takes the elements constituting oil and recombines them after use ("oil recycling"), one is doing something entirely pointless, because the whole reason to use the oil in the first place is to generate energy from it, and if it takes more energy to recombine than the amount of energy you get out, then it\'s a senseless activity. The point is that when we talk about "using" oil, we\'re really talking about "using" the energy content.\n\nYou can go further; there isn\'t really a finite amount of gold, it\'s just that the amount of energy required to generate gold from, say, iron using a series of nuclear fusion reactions is astronomical, literally. So again it\'s really an energy scarcity.\n\nThere is a concept called "Liebig\'s law" in ecology which says that the carrying capacity of a system is limited by the most scarce resource; some people try to use this to argue that the human population is vastly higher and so must crash, my counter to that is that energy is *always* the scarce resource and we aren\'t close to using all that\'s available (see solar, nuclear).\n\nIt\'s my intuition that many people have a gut reaction to proof of work that it feels kludgy and wrong and wasteful to them, but I think that\'s because they haven\'t studied physics enough, or maybe more precisely that they don\'t believe that physics should even enter into this discussion.
