This enables making and recording transactions between people.  Since this is a proper noun, it is capitalized.\n\nThe second is the unit of measure for the size of a transaction.  This is written "2.24 bitcoins" like we write "2.24 meters", uncapitalized.\n\nPart of the Bitcoin software is a distributed public ledger that records transactions between "addresses" (i.e account numbers).  It\'s called the "Block Chain", where blocks are sets of transactions verified by a checksum (hash), and chained because the previous hash is part of the data in the following block, which then gets its own hash, etc.  So all the blocks are linked in order.\n\nIf you have an up-to-date version of the block chain, you can calculate the balance of every address, simply by adding up all the transactions to and from that address, much like a check book register.  "A bitcoin" is simply the way to describe a balance of 1.00000000.  Balances can\'t leave the Block Chain, they can only move from one address to another.  So all 13.412 million bitcoins in existence (so far) are located on the Block Chain.\n\nThe properties of the protocol, network, and software are what give those balances value.  The unit name you apply to the balances is just a description, it has no value by itself, any more than "2 meters" does. "Two meters of cloth" has a value, because you apply the measurement to some entity.  "An address balance on the Block Chain of 2 bitcoins" also has a value, because you can trade that balance for other things.': 12, 'Same here, maybe someone should demonstrate by sending me a couple bitcoin to test it out.': 1, 'hosting a giveaway :)': 1, 'I got the 411 on bits.

I\'m sure treechains will adopt a lot of tech from sidechains.\n\nAnyway, here\'s my views on the idea, copied from the other thread:\n\nMy review of the paper is basically the same as before; nothing is in it that I wasn\'t expecting. (much of the content of the paper has been in public discussion on #bitcoin-wizards for a long time)\n\nI\'ve proposed ideas quite similar to sidechains myself before - I called them [Fidelity Bonded Ledgers](https://www.mail-archive.com/bitcoin-development%40lists.sourceforge.net/msg01786.html) - and the "rachetting" concept for redeeming funds by find the longest known chain is something gmaxwell and I came up with for fidelity bonded ledgers. I want to stress that **90% of the ideas in sidechains are good ideas**, and they\'ve had a lot of peer review. I\'ve been promoting sidechain concepts to my colored coin clients in fact, as they\'d be a great way to add auditabillity and shutdown-resistance to the centralized entities that will exist to trade colored coins at high speed and low cost; the smartcolors kernel I\'m working on is specifically designed to work well with sidechains and hub-and-spoke micropayment systems.\n\nThe idea of a Dynamic Membership Multi-Party Signature (DMMS) is a very clever way of describing Bitcoin\'s PoW in terms of a cryptographic signature; AFAIK the idea is a novel one. As an academic tool it\'s a great description, and I think helps make clear the issues with proof-of-stake. But would I create a production financial system using DMMS? No.\n\nThe problem is applying the DMMS signature concept to deciding history with 2-way-pegs. Basically doing that means that you have a pot of money - the 2-way-pegged funds - which can be taken by anyone with hashing power to spare. It creates a situation where 51% attacking a sidechain has a strong monetary incentive, one that even grows as more people use the sidechain. (remember this incentive may be due to lost coins too!) Fixes like re-org proofs only delay the inevitable: with sufficient hashing power 51% attackers can steal the pegged funds, and earn a lot of money doing so.\n\nThe second issue is that 2-way-pegs are most viable with merge-mining. Without merge-mining, hashing power is split among all the sidechains, leading to the poor security situation we already see in the altcoin market. (do I really need to list all the alts that have been 51% attacked?) Merge-mining is a seductive alternative - let miners secure our chain at no cost to them - but it\'s equally good at letting attackers attack our chain at no cost. Of course, sidechain promoters will bring up notions of \'opportunity cost\' in defence, arguing that attacking the chain is not cost free because the chain can reward miners in some way. But economic rewards aren\'t universal: if my country doesn\'t let me mine Zerocash for legal reasons, the value of mining Zerocash to me is zero. If I\'m invested in a sidechain that competes with Zerocash - perhaps RingSigCash - the value of mining Zerocash to me may even be negative for helping out the competition. Equally on top of that, I always have the opportunity of stealing 2-way-pegged funds, or at minimum, DoS attacking the competing chain by triggering re-org protection rules until enough miners give up mining it for me to steal the funds.\n\nThe third issue is that merge-mining promotes mining centralization. Heck, the sidechain paper says so itself, pointing out that the overhead costs of mining a sidechain make large pools more profitable than small ones, and suggests that perhaps validation could be outsourced to third-parties. For instance Blockstream could act as a central sidechain verification service that mining pools contract with, giving control of the sidechains over to the third-party... Needless to say, this is just hiding that centralization by adding a level of indirection.\n\nShould Bitcoin adopt the soft-fork required to make (merge-)mined 2-way-pegged sidechains possible? Well, Ethereum doesn\'t have a choice: it\'s scripting system is sufficiently complete that it already supports the creation of 2-way-pegs. (I\'d suggest sidechain devs look into developing the idea there!) Bitcoin may want to support 2-way-pegged sidechains that are signed by (federated) central authorities - but we\'re going to want to think very, very carefully how we\'re going to avoid the serious downsides of encouraging more merge-mining.': 37, "Thanks for the reasonable and level headed response Greg. \n\nI suppose I am upset at the fact that you seem to have been a balancing force for a long time on debates on the mailing list and #bitcoin-dev/wizards, and now are financially incentivized (even if unconsciously) to make decisions that would be in blockstreams' favor (i.e. changes to code that will enable merged-mining and two way pegging).  Of all people, I'm most upset to see you on this project.  I've spoken with austin hill in the past and have not got along well with him and suspicious of his profit model and ultimate goals to create a monopoly on bitcoin development.  I also think he's a snake taking you developers for a ride.\n\nHere's how I see this playing out:\n\n1. Lots of people, myself included, want to see the functionality that Blockstream is building go directly into Bitcoin Core -- but it's impossible because of trolls and skeptics who will shout FUD from the mountaintops to stop any hard fork from happening.  \n\n2. So, you guys go create a much better network on the side chain.  I see the benefits of sidechain features so I'll move all my BTC to it.  It's inevitable that everyone else sees the benefits as well and eventually >50% of all BTC are moved over to your sidechain. Even those stupid trolls who made your life miserable and impossible to implement hardfork wishlists into bitcoin1.0 will make the change. \n\n3.  Blockstream is now in total control of the development of the sidechain that has a majority of BTC moved to it.  Blockstream has the best talent and developers, and able to raise unlimited amounts of money from VC's to consolidate talent and firm up its monopoly on Bitcoin development.  It becomes a totally centralized system at that point, and Blockstream makes changes and dev updates based on what business needs it has at any time. Austin Hill laughs all the way to the bank with what I bet is at least a majority stake in the company.  \n\n4. Austin Hill, CEO of Blockstream and majority stake holder, now controls development of Bitcoin (because Bitcoin is now your sidechain). Some regulators tell him to do something. You disagree with him so he fires you, and it doesn't matter because by then 90% of BTC are on your side-chain and used by 100 million people who don't have a clue whats going because their coins are in consumer wallets like Circle and Coinbase (who aren't willing to move them back to Bitcoin 1.0 main-chain because it's featureless, and Blockstream sidechain has the network effect.)\n\nA perfect coup d'etat.\n\nIf Gavin and Wladimir are poached / paid off by Austin Hill, its game over.\n\nEDIT: At this point, it would be reasonable for you and Pieter to step down from your roles as maintainers.

That's what I'm talking about there, and it's something that Bitcoin would need a soft-fork to support. (either a dedicated opcode, or a significantly richer scripting language)\n\nWould such a soft-fork be a good idea? Maybe! So long as the benefits outweigh the risks - encouraging merge-mining by making it more useful is one of those potential risks.\n\n> As you (and the paper) note merged mining, is orthorgonal to sidechains\n\nIt's certainly not orthogonal to PoW-secured sidechains. We've got two main models there, mining, and merge-mining.

But it's being *promoted* by a for profit company with obvious incentives to get their technology implemented, incentives that may override the incentives of the Bitcoin space in general.

In what respect do you think sidechains are distinct from the hundreds of ordinary altcoins in regard to this?\n\nIgnoring fringe stability issues... in the BAR model with zero-alturists, and assuming infinite hashrate for dollars availalbity, I think I have a formal argument that they're actually equal.   Though that's pretty contrived: in the real world there are altruistics, rationality isn't uniform, hashrate limitations exist.  yadda yadda.  Really the hashrate incentives have not really been well analyized in Bitcoin just by itself, there is a lot of work to do there for just plain Bitcoin.

Because of the decentralized nature of Bitcoin, creating an incentive to attack individual users' wallets helps everyone in the long run, because it incentivizes innovation in personal digital security while only hurting a few people who didn't properly secure their coins. In the same way, because of the decentralized nature of Bitcoin + sidechains, 51% attacks on sidechains will incentivize innovation in the field of preventing 51% attacks. With sidechains, we have an infinite number of tries before we create a sidechain that is impervious to 51% attacks (or as close to impervious as possible).

Cuckoo filters support adding and removing items dynamically while achieving even higher performance than Bloom filters. For applications that store many items [e.g. Bitcoin transactions] and target moderately low false positive rates, cuckoo filters have lower space overhead than space-optimized Bloom filters.

Because that\'s not going to happen. Finally, I think what we are seeing here *is* "passionate innovation." You don\'t think there are plenty of people passionate about making Bitcoin better?': 2, 'My review of the paper is basically the same as before; nothing is in it that I wasn\'t expecting. (much of the content of the paper has been in public discussion on #bitcoin-wizards for a long time)\n\nI\'ve proposed ideas quite similar to sidechains myself before - I called them [Fidelity Bonded Ledgers](https://www.mail-archive.com/bitcoin-development%40lists.sourceforge.net/msg01786.html) - and the "rachetting" concept for redeeming funds by find the longest known chain is something gmaxwell and I came up with for fidelity bonded ledgers. I want to stress that **90% of the ideas in sidechains are good ideas**, and they\'ve had a lot of peer review. I\'ve been promoting sidechain concepts to my colored coin clients in fact, as they\'d be a great way to add auditabillity and shutdown-resistance to the centralized entities that will exist to trade colored coins at high speed and low cost; the smartcolors kernel I\'m working on is specifically designed to work well with sidechains and hub-and-spoke micropayment systems.\n\nThe idea of a Dynamic Membership Multi-Party Signature (DMMS) is a very clever way of describing Bitcoin\'s PoW in terms of a cryptographic signature; AFAIK the idea is a novel one. As an academic tool it\'s a great description, and I think helps make clear the issues with proof-of-stake. But would I create a production financial system using DMMS? No.\n\nThe problem is applying the DMMS signature concept to deciding history with 2-way-pegs. Basically doing that means that you have a pot of money - the 2-way-pegged funds - which can be taken by anyone with hashing power to spare. It creates a situation where 51% attacking a sidechain has a strong monetary incentive, one that even grows as more people use the sidechain. (remember this incentive may be due to lost coins too!) Fixes like re-org proofs only delay the inevitable: with sufficient hashing power 51% attackers can steal the pegged funds, and earn a lot of money doing so.\n\nThe second issue is that 2-way-pegs are most viable with merge-mining. Without merge-mining, hashing power is split among all the sidechains, leading to the poor security situation we already see in the altcoin market. (do I really need to list all the alts that have been 51% attacked?) Merge-mining is a seductive alternative - let miners secure our chain at no cost to them - but it\'s equally good at letting attackers attack our chain at no cost. Of course, sidechain promoters will bring up notions of \'opportunity cost\' in defence, arguing that attacking the chain is not cost free because the chain can reward miners in some way. But economic rewards aren\'t universal: if my country doesn\'t let me mine Zerocash for legal reasons, the value of mining Zerocash to me is zero. If I\'m invested in a sidechain that competes with Zerocash - perhaps RingSigCash - the value of mining Zerocash to me may even be negative for helping out the competition. Equally on top of that, I always have the opportunity of stealing 2-way-pegged funds, or at minimum, DoS attacking the competing chain by triggering re-org protection rules until enough miners give up mining it for me to steal the funds.\n\nThe third issue is that merge-mining promotes mining centralization. Heck, the sidechain paper says so itself, pointing out that the overhead costs of mining a sidechain make large pools more profitable than small ones, and suggests that perhaps validation could be outsourced to third-parties. For instance Blockstream could act as a central sidechain verification service that mining pools contract with, giving control of the sidechains over to the third-party... Needless to say, this is just hiding that centralization by adding a level of indirection.\n\nShould Bitcoin adopt the soft-fork required to make (merge-)mined 2-way-pegged sidechains possible? Well, Ethereum doesn\'t have a choice: it\'s scripting system is sufficiently complete that it already supports the creation of 2-way-pegs. (I\'d suggest sidechain devs look into developing the idea there!) Bitcoin may want to support 2-way-pegged sidechains that are signed by (federated) central authorities - but we\'re going to want to think very, very carefully how we\'re going to avoid the serious downsides of encouraging more merge-mining.': 65, 'Fascist attempt by bitcoin people to steal all the innovation and equity from altcoins.': -2, 'negatively?': 1, "Finally get to see what's been worked up.  \n\nI'd wait until the paper is out; Peter isn't exactly the most unbiased on the topic.": 12, 'http://www.blockstream.com/sidechains.pdf  \n\npaper released': 5, "I don't buy the premise.

Because if it didn\'t, then there is a huge uncertainty about whether remaining resources are used for alternative Y or they do not interfere with the voting process. Is it possible that X did not suck in a lot of resources while alternatives are still not possible? Then it would mean that X logically follows from whatever previous state of the system and there is no voting process needed.\n\n>Therefore: message X should be provably recent and should have employed provably big amount of resources, big enough that there are not enough resources left for any alternative Y to produce in a reasonably short time frame. Also, the message X should be always "recent" and always outcompete any alternative. Because we cannot reliably compare "old" messages: is Y an "old" one that was just delivered now, or was it produced just now after resources spent on X were released?\n\n>This logically leads us to the following: we should accept only the messages with the biggest Proof-of-Work attached, and that proof-of-work should be the greatest possible ever, so there would not be any possibility for any alternative to be produce in the short window of time. And that proof-of-work must be constantly reinforced or the value of previous consensus begins to fade quickly as the opportunity for alternatives grows. \n\nThe "should have employed provably big amount of resources, big enough that there are not enough resources left for any alternative Y" condition can only be met for the parent blockchain, and also for the _largest blockchain employing that particular PoW algorithm_.\n\nDouble SHA-256 can only generate meaningful proofs for Bitcoin.
