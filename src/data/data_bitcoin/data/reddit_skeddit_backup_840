The high put to call ratio I've consistently seen in the S&P over the past few months (essentially over 2.0 everyday since I've been watching meticulously) tells me that stocks like GoPro are bubbles and IPOs like Alibaba are just ways to make a quick buck(I like Alibaba as a company but the stock could go down 5-10% any day because a lot of that money in there is just fluff waiting for profits to be taken)\n\nGetting a little off topic but my point is a 5% sell off in Alibaba is a loss of $10 billion dollars in market cap. Once you can, for instance, sell some Alibaba and throw it into bitcoin all in 2 minutes, there's a lot of room for bitcoin to run.

The Cyprus Banking Crisis sets off a Panic and speculative buying on bitcoins starts on the belief that it could become a recognized global reserve currency.... never proven to be adopted en mass by cypriots but speculation persists because of the US and Chinese Currency war, Greece and the Euro Zone defaults as a real risk and China not making a comment about bitcoin until ~$800 USD per coin which ambiguous at best which let the price rise more until they starting talking about controls and thats when the price plunges started, more interpretation and recoveries in price and the more talk of controls, rinse and repeat.\n\n2. ASICs arrive on the market bolstering network security and huge gains for early receivers - but... truly expensive for those who units arrive late or never at all or just walked in way too late with high expectations.\n\n\nThese are the reasons for the continued price decline.  The Chinese exchange OKCoin (I could be wrong) just released longer term financial instruments for users to collect interest on.  In this market interest will only soften the loss but not hedge against if the users hold on to these instruments.. they are not better off than the miners who bought hardware they can not capitalize on.  \n\nHowever the issue on the effects of short selling instruments and the affect on price could be a new factor in bitcoin.

It\'s not a "fundamental revolution".\n\nAnd really, I can see that perspective.  From a far away perspective, that\'s totally correct.  But I don\'t agree that it\'s not a massive shift in how the society works, and what can be done.  \n\nI\'ll give you an example.  Transportation from 150 years ago.  The invention of the railroad fundamentally changed society in the mid 1800s.  In the US, travelling across the country wasn\'t this long, arduous, dangerous journey anymore.  So masses of people moved west.\n\nThe internet is the same thing.  Suddenly people who haven\'t met in person are communicating across continents on a daily basis.  That\'s never happened before in the history of mankind, and represents a fundamental shift in society.   The society is so incredibly nerdy now, it\'s unrecognizable from 30 years ago.  If Marty McFly arrived from 1985 in 2015, he\'d think the world had been invaded by nerds.  Nobody but a few pioneers used computers in 1985.  Nobody really understood what memory, storage, and a processor was.  \n\nThese days people have conversations about how much memory their phone has, or how fast it is, or that it doesn\'t have enough storage to store all their music.  I\'m not saying people have a DEEP understanding of these concepts, but the expectations of what you have to know about the world to survive in it are vastly different than just 30 years ago.\n\nI suspect bitcoin is going to be the same thing.  It\'s going to transform things in ways we can\'t yet fully imagine.
