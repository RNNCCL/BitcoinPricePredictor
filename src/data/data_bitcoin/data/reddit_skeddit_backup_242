(which is still competitive with today\'s wire transfer systems)\nSince it is in the best interest of bitcoin companies to get the machine running, I expect one part of the loss will be assumed by miners, one part by companies paying higher fees than individual.\nThis is without talking about individual using RBF to get their transaction to confirm.\n\nEven if I agree this would be nice to fix the problem by smoothing the halving, I don\'t think this would be a disaster because fee will play their role on short term, until adjustement catch up the problem.\n\nImagine a world where miners get 99% of revenue by fees, do you expect the heart attack to occur ? I guess you don\'t, because miners will prefer to foot the bill until next adjustment.\n\nIf it is 0.35% then the bill will be higher, for them, and some business will have no problem into paying high premium in transaction fees. From your premise, this will have no impact on the rate.\n\nI would note that you are going against your own premises by saying\n> A falling USD/BTC price widens the gulf between mining costs and revenues, and makes the problem even worse, potentially resulting in a death spiral.\n\nIf you consider that the market will adapt because of profit opportunity, such that, we will not result into a sudden change rate change, then it is not reasonable to say afterward "if that happen then we\'ll suddenly have a drop of rate".': 2, "> I think big companies that rely on the network will mine themselves, at zero or temporarily-negative profit so their business doesn't fail.\n\nMy back of the envelope guess is that that could plausibly cost the equivalent of +$10,000,000 US. People are going to want to pass that buck, I think.\n\nAlso, someone could deliberately *exploit* this weakness. I mean short Bitcoin right before, and during, the halving. In fact, this opportunity (if indeed profitable) will attract profit-seeking traders (and become self-fulfilling).": 7, '> I think big companies that rely on the network will mine themselves, at zero or temporarily-negative profit so their business doesn\'t fail.\n\nThey will just pay miners by raising fees, it is more efficient than making every business becoming a miner.

The author makes the (faulty) assumption that miners in general are perfectly rational economic actors, which is absolutely not the case. A quote to highlight this:\n\n>In short, we will reach a day when all miners have small profit margins, and then a blockreward-halving will slash their revenues in half. The result will be that not half, but all miners will shut off their mining rigs.\n\nThe implication here seems to be "If mining is unprofitable, all miners will shut off automatically, all at once. And then the hashrate will be zero, and no one will turn miners on again.", but that hinges on all miners being perfectly rational economic actors. Unless i\'m missing something, I can\'t imagine that this doomsday scenario will actually come to pass.': 1, '> If you had actually read the post you would have encountered this paragraph\n\nIt is a long post, which rely on an assumption that is not explained.

This is untrue. Even if I accept the fact that some meteorite come into Bitcoin which make all miners turning off their rig because profitability dropped, if it still has use for users and business, they will just raise the fee to make it become profitable once again.\n\nWhat might happen, if I accept your conclusion without even looking at your premise, is a sudden peak of transaction fee. The market does not stay still to change. If mining is valuable, then people will pay for it as fee or mining contract. If it is temporary, then business will foot the bill until readjustment instead of crashing their business.': 1, "Utility.  I think that 21 Inc's plan is to allow you to sell your excess computing power.": 1, '>that\'s why you\'re wrong now.\n\nI was referring to your \'mining heart attack\' clickbait title.  The mining network is not going to collapse.\n\n>Whether it does or doesn\'t collapse, "miners like you will become profitable again" is still false, do you agree?\n\nNo I don\'t necessarily agree, unless you are speaking of a very temporary time frame.  Market conditions are dynamic.  Once the difficulty adjusts and/or the price rises, miners like me can be profitable again.\n\nOf course revenue will *temporarily* drop at the halving.  But you are failing to take into account the reaction of the thousands of disparate market participants following the halving.  Each of these market participants has their own motivations, risk thresholds, budgets, future price expectations, external concerns, etc.  They will not shut down in unison.  I know this because I\'ve watched them confound the critics by not shutting down, even during price crashes, for the last four years.\n\nThe immediate effect following the block reward halving in 2012 was that mining revenue was cut in half.  In reaction, some of the miners, presumably unprofitable ones, turned off.   Because of this, difficulty dropped about 14%.  Because of the difficulty drop, I returned to profitability.  None of the critics predicted miners returning to profitability.  Note that 86% of the miners/mining power kept right on mining.  Some of them were profitable, maybe some of them weren\'t.   At the very next difficulty adjustment, difficulty rose about 9%.  Why?  Because with the newly lowered difficulty following the halving, prospective miners like myself were running numbers and realizing that mining was now more profitable for them, therefore they powered on rigs.  The network did not collapse.\n\nMeanwhile, a couple months later, the bitcoin price started rising.  The reason the price rose is because demand was rising, and demand was rising because more people were realizing that Bitcoin is useful for using money on the internet without a central third party. Because Bitcoin is useful, the price went up.  Because the price went up, mining became more profitable.  Because mining became more profitable, more miners started mining.  The network did not collapse, instead it grew larger.  Critics did not foresee the price rise because critics did not understand that Bitcoin is useful.  Critics did not foresee miners continuing to mine, even potentially at a loss, because critics did not understand that Bitcoin is useful.  \n\nIn my experience, mining only becomes unprofitable for short periods.  Before long, either the price rises or the difficulty drops as some miners shut down.  Mining becomes slightly profitable again, so miners stop shutting down.  The cycle continues.  \n\nAny attempt to understand the mining dynamic must include the realization that Bitcoin is uniquely useful.  The ability for peers to transact in a mathematically transparent and verifiable way without a central third party is valued by the market.  This drives the price, the price drives mining, future price expectations drive mining, ideals drive mining.  If you believe that Bitcoin is useful, it follows that there will always be a market for transactions to be processed.  If you do not believe that Bitcoin is useful, then mining\'s failure to collapse will always be a mystery to you.': 1, 'Analyses like this never take into account that Bitcoin is uniquely useful, and there are people who want to use it.\n\nBecause Bitcoin is useful and people want to use it, there will always be a market for mining transactions.  If nothing else, the users and businesses who want to use Bitcoin have an incentive to mine themselves so that they maintain the ability to transact with any other person or business in any country at will without requiring permission from any third party.  This is a useful service that Bitcoin miners provide.  \n': 2, "Most of these points are discussed in the article.\n\nOne new thing to say is that the title is not clickbait.

Gavin above indicated that this might be a problem in the future, which is the exact thesis of the post.\n\nObviously I expected r/bitcoin to have a mindless, uninformed reaction to any post that isn't obviously a Bitcoin circlejerk. You are part of that mindless reaction.\n\nSecond new thing, you claim that I fail to recognize that Bitcoin has value because it is uniquely useful. It is false (you might read literally anything else on that blog), and actually the reverse: I describe a situation where people want to use Bitcoin but can't, because the block generation process is disabled. I also point out that the problem wouldn't destroy Bitcoin, as someone would reset it (at unknown but plausibly minor inconvenience) in the worst case.\n\nSo, your failure to understand the post is almost 100%.": 1, 'I think "asking users to spend more money for no reason" would be a weird plan even if the CEO were anti-decentralization.': 1, 'No.  It is better to let someone else do it.': 2, "> Go look at litecoin to see how it fared after the halving\n\nThis is a projection of a future problem.

The main thing is that it's pretty simple (Python) code and maybe will be more clear what it does.\n\n\n\nThe blocks are not stored in the blk files in sequence so you have to read to the end and then backtrack using previous hash from block headers until you get to the genesis block (or an already known block). And the blocks near the end (most recent) can be missing as well since they are downloaded from other nodes and some arrive before others.\n\nThis code is tested working but still does get confused sometimes when trying to parse while catching up is in progress.

Try it yourself, do a getblocktemplate call with a 100,000 transaction mempool and one with a 2000 transaction mempool and there's a big difference, several seconds compared to nearly instant.": 3, 'Here\'s what i think has happened. Several weeks back a spammer hit the network hard with a couple hundred thousand ~15.5kB transactions that paid ~1000 satoshi fee each. 1000 satoshi is the default minrelaytxfee and 15kB is the default size of the "priority" transaction space set aside in a block. Priority transactions are very old transactions which miners will mine no matter the fee, so that they go out of the mempool eventually and this doesn\'t happen. However these transactions were over 15kB, so they don\'t fit in the default size priority space that miners give. So they never went away. In response, most miners have simply adjusted their minrelaytxfee so that their mempool doesn\'t fill up with these transactions and they never get mined. A large mempool has a very bad effect on the getblocktemplate latency for miners, so any miner who didn\'t reduce their mempool in this way would have a rather large (a couple percent extra?) orphan rate compared to those who did. Meanwhile, the transactions continue sitting idly in nodes\' mempools getting rebroadcast occasionally by those of us who keep large mempool and default minrelaytxfee. But miners aren\'t mining them. With the possible exception of 21 Inc, I\'ve noticed every block they mine is a full 1MB.': 10, "> When transactions are valid (which means they are accepted by a validating node) they get accepted by nodes, and relayed to other nodes.\n\nThat isn't what valid means or does.

You may have the data somewhere, but there isn't now and never will there be a guarantee that your transaction will make it into a block.\n\nYou can talk about your personal mempool, and you could change your clients minrelayfee and other rules so you could create billions of 0 fee dust transactions in your own mempool, but they aren't going to make it into the blockchain.\n\n>This is the inherent behaviour that comes out of the rules that Satoshi himself put in the system. The only way to change that is to centralize decision making on what to evict from the mempool.\n\nNo, this is wrong. You don't need to agree to a central authorities eviction rules, but you can accept someones eviction rules and use them yourself.

It is now fully invested.\n\nAccording to the fund, the strong performance is partly down to the Jersey Financial Services Commission and the States of Jersey introducing a draft legislation to permit and promote business in bitcoin and using blockchain technology.\n\nGlobal Advisors was part of a consultation group involved in developing the legislation. The draft has been in the pipeline for 18 months, and is expected to be set in to law in Q1 2016.\n\nThe fund also cited a ruling from the court of the European Union exempting bitcoin from VAT and the coming to a close of the legal proceedings involving bitcoin and the \xe2\x80\x98darknet\xe2\x80\x99 market, Silk Road, as factors leading to increased bitcoin investment.': 1}, ('Bitcoin and Blockchain Square Off at Money20/20', 24): {"1 BTC says that Bitcoin will beat Blockchain's butt.
