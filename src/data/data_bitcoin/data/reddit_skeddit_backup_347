These nodes are also typically well connected. Peers receiving your trx will store it in their "mempool" (trxs waiting for confirmation), and also relay it onwards to more peers. This way it gets out to all nodes. Some nodes are miners and they will (or can, depending on their own choice) include it in a block. eg. https://blockchain.info/pushtx\n\nTo build a trx you need some software that is capable of collecting up unspent outputs you have keys for and creating a specific data structure, and signing that with the required keys. That results in a small block of data often expressed in "hex" format (transmitted across the network as binary data). This trx data is typically a few hundred bytes but could be longer if it\'s complex (has many inputs / outputs).\n\nPrograms like bitcoin-qt and Electrum can create a hex format transaction.

After the first few delinquencies (fortunately I only invested about 1 to 5 BTC initially) I decided to treat this system with the respect I give to my investment portfolio and focused primarily on BTCJam (as I saw they had recently been funded by some of the bigger Silicon Valley VC firms) as my vehicle of choice.\n\nI began to thoroughly vet the new investments/borrowers and not just jump into something because the numbers were good.  I would interact with the user in their comments section to gauge how active they were.  Active users got more credit from me.  I would also see who (other users) would vouch for them, or if they were more easily verifiable than other loan request.  I also began to really rely on the credit score created by BTCJam.\n\nNow to date... I have about 150 borrowers that I am becoming exclusive with.  That means, I only make an investment about once per week (sometimes more) when one of my previous relationships post a new loan request.  I have put in more BTC since I have developed this game plan and things are looking much better and my losses (potential losses in reality, as I haven\'t had any true defaults yet) are evaporating.\n\nI still have those late pays.  Some I hear from and some will likely go to arbitration, but it seems the ones that will go to arbitration will be offset by the gains made with my new protocol.  I will also keep you updated if you request.\n\nI know this is long winded, but I wanted to let you know I share some of your frustration... but I believe there is light at the end of this tunnel.  Here are some of my thoughts moving forward.\n\nP2P lending with Bitcoin is brand new.  There are going to be some bugs to work out.  I believe BTCJam is getting them worked out and their Customer service is amazing!!!  I mean, they are here on reddit posting as I am typing.  Try and be patient as I have seen several of my \xe2\x80\x9clate pays\xe2\x80\x9d pay late but especially be patient in waiting for the right borrower.  Don\'t just invest because you feel like you will miss an opportunity.  Be respectful and absolutely professional when commenting to borrowers.  I know for myself if I was late on a loan and was getting trolled to the ends of the earth I might be too embarrassed or too truculent to show back up and make a payment.  Just some food for thought.\n\nThanks for the post and sharing your situation and thoughts.  It\'s actions like these that will help get this Brave New Bitcoin World dialed in!!': 5, '"Users get blacklisted for many reason (which I will not disclose)."  BitLendingClub seems to be doing fine without censoring their users\' comments, and they also provide a forum for discussion.  This concern shows up repeatedly on the site.

As an individual trying to borrow, I can understand why you are frustrated. \n\nWhile you were passionate - there were inaccuracies in your statements, I would like to explain how we calculate APR and the expected returns for investors (even though you are a borrower and not an active investor as you admit).\n\nAPR stands for annual percentage rate and is the monthly rate multiplied by 12. It's not ^12 as we do in Brazil.\n\nAlso, the Current AutoInvest returns are calculated considering: (i) ALL late payments will incur in defaults; (ii) ALL current payments will keep paying. Every time there\xe2\x80\x99s a payment to be made we update the returns based on the payment activity. We believe this is a fair way to look at the returns until all the loans mature.\n\nLastly, to compute the APR - normalize all terms into monthly results and then multiply by 12. Simply because a 1-month loan that pays back 10% has a APR of 120% while a 1-year loan with the same 10% return has an APR of 10%. \n\nSo, all that being said, your statement that we have a 48% fraud rate is completely wrong.\n\nI appreciate that you brought this subject up because clearly we need to spend more time explaining how we operate and calculate the formulas we show on the website.\n\nPlease don\xe2\x80\x99t hesitate to contact us if you have any other questions.\n\nBest,\n- Gustavo": 10, 'The return is in check too, but this is not the question he asked.': 1, 'celledral': 1, "I am not surprised.

Here are my costs for the home-based node:\n\n1. Hardware - I put together a small miniITX system to act as a fileserver, running a node on it came later. I figure this cost is effectively zero for Bitcoin usage since it was a sunk cost for another project. I think in total I spent $500-600 on the hardware though.\n2. Bandwidth - The node uses so little bandwidth, I have seen no impact to my Internet connection even during "stress-test"/spam attacks. My node has 20 connections currently. Since I pay a flat rate for a specific amount of bandwidth (~$50 for 75Mbps/75Mbps), and would be paying this cost anyway, this is also effectively zero.\n3. Storage - I run bitcoind under it\'s own user, it\'s home directory is currently ~50GB. This server was setup to store files and has 2TB of space (hey, it\'s an old system that use to be a TON). Again, effectively free and only using a small portion of the drive.\n4. Power/Cooling - For simplicity, we\'ll just look at the power cost since this thing runs pretty cool. I have measured with a power draw of around 100 watts for the file server. I pay **$0.098402 per kWh**, which means it costs ~~$14.37~~**$7.18 per month** to run the server. This is my only significant cost with regards to running a Bitcoin node, as I could have the server shutdown when I\'m not home and use Wake-On-Lan via my router to turn it on as-needed.\n\nOf note, this is a dual-core atom processor with 4GB of ram, and it can still handle being a full-node, and keeping the full txindex.\n\nEdit: Accidentally did my math at 200 watts.': 5, '> the point i was making is that most people will just want to run a "light" network node\n\n[100 million bittorrent users](http://extratorrent.cc/stat/) disagree (that number is seeders + leechers). Bittorrent is a peer-to-peer network, just like the bitcoin network.  Both can generate quite a bit of bandwidth.\n\n>  leaving the mining to be done by conglomerates,\n\nYou are still confusing mining and network nodes.  Network nodes validate and relay transactions.  Miners are also nodes, that\'s how they get transactions to put in a block.  But in addition they search for block hashes in order to claim the block reward & transaction fees.  That\'s much more intensive.\n\n> ...or is it possible to validate the blockchain without mining?\n\nNodes validate the existing blockchain by calculating each block hash and comparing it to the hash value stored in the next block.  When a new block arrives, they validate it too.  When new transactions arrive individually, they are also validated several ways for correctness (digital signature matches, etc.).  The node also verifies the sending addresses have enough funds to make the transaction.  That\'s a simple lookup at past transactions for that address, and prevents double-spending.\n\nIf a new transaction fails any of the validation tests, it does not get relayed to other nodes.  If it passes, it gets relayed across the network.  Good transactions get added to a "memory pool" of new transactions not yet in a block.  Miners draw from that pool to create blocks from.  When a new block gets relayed across the network, nodes remove the transactions now in a block from their copy of the memory pool.  \n\nBlocks don\'t verify transactions, that already happened when the transactions were relayed across the network.  Blocks just gather transactions and apply a checksum (hash) so that future tampering is difficult to do.\n\n> i\'d want a network that allows nearly anyone to mine meaningfully,\n\nThe ASIC chips that are used for mining are small.  They can be incorporated into USB devices, or electric water heaters, where the waste heat can be put to use.  Mining farms just buy a whole lot of them, and optimize for cheap electricity and labor to manage them.  But assuming you get the latest generation of ASIC, you can do meaningful mining.  Perhaps not make a profit, but at least cover electricity and help maintain the network.\n\n> because i leave a base amount of cash in my account and the bank waives fees for that \n\nUntil you need one of those services they charge extra for.

One could imagine a really extreme scenario where tx fees reached a million dollars for example, and all of the attacker's coins were absorbed as fees in a single block.\n\nYou also need to consider factors outside the normal model.
