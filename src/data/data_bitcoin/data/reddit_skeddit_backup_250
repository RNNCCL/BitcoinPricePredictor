The vast majority (like 99%) of it was conjured into existence by commercial banks through the act of making loans. The banks are limited in how much new money they can create by the amount of money that has been deposited with them, but the money deposited with them can be (and usually is) money that another commercial bank created by making a loan, so this is how $1 of central-bank-printed money can turn into $99 of circulating money.": 1}, ('Bitcoin is officially tax-free in Europe', 1): {}, ("The best explanation I've heard about Bitcoin so far", 44): {'Excellent ': 2, 'I like the idea of first explaining what money is, as that already answers many of the questions people have about bitcoin': 1, "While some things are simplified, such as bitcoin being a lot more than just the first decentralized open currency.

In fact I went out of my way to say they need to pay all their transaction taxes etc. \n\nIn the usa to sell property you just need to take your deed that has been signed over from the old owner to you and register it at tje country courthouse.  (usually the signing of both parties on the deed tranfer mist be witnesses by a notsry republic who stamps it. Even if not its a good idea to prevent the old owner from later denying he signed it) The old owner can have signed that deed over to you for any reason at all including trading for another peice of property, cash, a car, or just becuase they like your face.\n\nThe owner will have that deed i  their own records and if tjey dont they can go to the county court house and get another official copy.\n\nNow if they have a mortgage then the bank may keep the deed until it is paid off depending on state law. And or the bank has recorded a lien on the property and the county registrar will not reregister the deed with the new owner unless the bank provided a paper rlease that the debt has been paid off.\n\nWhen buying a property you dont have to record what form the consideration was ie a traded car, cash, another property or nothing. However you usually have record the value of the consideration and pay a transfer tax based on the value of the consideration. Thats why you can often tell what someone paid for a property form the transfer tax. You can sell a property for farless or morethan it is "worth" \n\nIf the property is a gift becuaseof your pretty face then the transfer tax may be handled according to state or county practice.  Annual property tax however will be based on the tax assesors valuation of the property no matter what waspaid.\n\nYou can give away property. it happens all the time if people no longer want to pay the taxes and live far away for example and will never use it and it snt worth much.\n\nIf someone bought a house from an owner for bitcoin thenthey would record the actual market value of bitcoin at the time it was sold i would guess. That wouldnt be fraud. And you dont have to say "1000 bitcoins" on the tranfer deed blank. In fact many deeds dont habe a place at all for what was paid but the county registrar will wnat to know for the transfer tax to be right. For example an american could sell his house in nyew york for a suitcase full of euros if they wanted. Or for a box of junk.  But the transfer tax mist be paid on the true value. In a case where you sold it for a box of junk that might be difficult to determine and tje rile might be use a recent rough appraisal. I dont know.\n\nBy the way you can always over pay your transfer tax to hide the true price you paid for the property. That happens in commercial deals sometimes when tje new owners dont want other businesses to know whst they actually paid.
