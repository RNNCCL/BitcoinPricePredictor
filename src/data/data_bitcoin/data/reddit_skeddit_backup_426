He can now make another busy block...\n\nThis will kill Bitcoin price, so no serious miner would do this, but it's a LOT more sustainable than a 51% attack, heck... someone could amass 5% of the network and have a 1/20 chance of hitting the network, just multiply the size of their busy block by 20 and bam! yayyy!!": 1, "> The difficulty just makes sure that blocks come out every 10 minutes.\n\nIt also makes hash power more profitable.

Hostile miners (people not mining for profit but purely to spite Bitcoin) could easily mine blocks and stuff them full of garbage transactions.\n\nToday it is very costly to reliably mine blocks so the incentive to spend a few million bucks just to spam the network is very low.\n\nFurthermore since most blocks are mined by one of a handful of pools, if any pool started accepting / creating spam transactions, individual miners would quickly leave that pool.': 1, "There's another reason that I don't see anyone discussing. The block reward is on a schedule to decrease to 0. Right now it is 25BTC but late next year it will be 12.5BTC. If the block reward drops then there will be a much lower incentive to mine. The expectation was that transaction fees would increase slowly to make up this difference. However, if the block size is unlimited then there is no reason to pay a transaction fee as transaction will always be included in the next block.\n\nSatoshi intended for there to be competition between people adding transactions such that the fees would be enough to support the network. Without an upper limit on the blocksize this economic incentive will not exist and mining will become unprofitable at the current hashrates. Blocks will still be mined at the same speed in this future but there will be many fewer miners and the network will become less secure.": 1, 'OK, so seems like we agree that lowering the block reward will lower the security of the network.

It becomes a market for optimizing size and fees. \n\nIt's not important at this stage because the subsidized block reward is so high.": 6, 'exactly!': 1, 'I can\'t speak for "people", but I\'m not forgetting that this is possible. It\'s just that this has been possible even with with 32 MB blocks from the earliest days of Bitcoin, and with 1 MB blocks since they were implemented. To my knowledge, an attempt to exploit this by a malicious miner has never occurred. And just a point of correction:  \n\n> Since the malicious miner collects the Fee He can Do it for free and as soon as 20mb Blocks are allowed.  \n\nAlthough a malicious miner trying this attack would definitely mine the first such large or artificially filled block, there\'s no guarantee that the malicious miner would mine any subsequent one, even with the head start he provides for himself. More importantly, let\'s presume the worst that can possibly happen here does happen: a malicious private miner (not even a pool) that has a large portion of Bitcoin\'s total hash power decides to try to exploit this attack. We assume also that this attacker has access to the fastest CPUs to process transactions and to verify large blocks, as well as the fastest Internet access to upload and receive large blocks. He executes this attack, and continues until his advantage starts increasing his share of found blocks beyond that which his share of hashing power should normally yield. As a result, this miner starts to drive his smaller competition, those that don\'t have the same resources and advantages out of business.  \n\nThis is not an attack that reaps much benefit over short periods. It must be maintained for an extended time to generate significant returns. Is it reasonable to suppose that the rest of the Bitcoin community will stand by and do nothing as this happens? And while the community watches this happening, the price of bitcoin would likely suffer dramatically. I think it\'s clear that the community would respond by taking any necessary steps to restrict or prevent such future attacks. It would quickly bolster the argument of those for small block sizes and centralized scalability solutions. It\'s even possible if it angers enough of the community that support could rise for a fork to a different hashing algorithm. Any number of solutions that I can\'t foresee could be employed, all to the detriment of the attacker.  \n\nSo what would the malicious miner gain? Marginally higher rewards (expressed only in bitcoin units) during the attack and before the community responds. Net profit (in non-bitcoin units) is not even guaranteed unless the malicious miner tries to short bitcoin at the same time. I\'d even question if exchanges would pay such a trader if it was determined they were the miner behind such actions.  \n\nMeanwhile, the malicious miner has generated enormous uncertainty for his future revenues and garnered the anger of the entire Bitcoin community. If the same miner simply continued with his/her normal business, they\'d have guaranteed returns, far less uncertainty, and wouldn\'t need to fear any pitchfork brigade or possible criminal/civil repercussions.  \n\nBased on this line of reasoning, I\'ve recently wondered what would have happened if the maximum block size limit was completely removed early on.

I understand that their needs to be for profit development on Bitcoin based services and I have nothing against it all. A system of this size can only survive on goodwill for so long after all. The merits of arguing there could be ulterior motives are not particularly strong anyway.\n\nI personally think there are two strong arguments against your position. Your argument against centralisation seems to be a false dilemma fallacy. There is an acceptable amount of centralisation of the system. Bitcoin is not perfectly decentralised right now and would likely be fine with a certain amount more centralisation (only up to a point of course). Saying that not even a small amount more centralisation can occur even if it solves very large problem is not a fair position to take in my opinion.\n\nThe second argument is more speculative but based on reason. This is also same reason why I believe keeping the current limit is extremely detrimental to bitcoin. Currently a lot of people and businesses have a lot (financially) riding on bitcoin's growth and utility. Whether you consider this to be a good or bad thing is irrelevant because it is fact.

On the flip side if bitcoin is purposely limited in it's growth and utility then it will lose users and the number of nodes will decrease.

Matthew thanks for acknowledging the hard work I\'ve been doing.\n\nAdam, I think asking questions is the right approach, and I don\'t think anyone has an outright agenda against me (hopefully), but I was disappointed that Scamtoshi never contacted me beforehand with his concerns like you did. Instead he just posted a very one sided argument claiming we are a scam. I feel there was an intention to damage our efforts as this post came out just as we started the fundraiser. I agree with you that there are many people trying to take advantage of Bitcoin 2.0 buzzwords, but I have an honest intention to build Dapps, I think this could be the biggest revolution in technology since the internet. By the way when I invited you to skype it was a follow up to my previous invitation, it wasn\'t implying to move the discussion there, but it was an open invitation for us to talk.\n\nRegarding your claims of the Howey test and securities, we do not fall under these categories. This has been vetted by our lawyers. Based on your claims all the other crypto fundraisers fall under this category and this is a subject which is not specific to our project. These claims can be made towards Ethereum, Factom, Koinify, LTBcoin and a bunch of other projects which make us look tiny in comparison.\n\nScamtoshi, the whitepaper has an extensive background on these technologies which many people have complimented and hundreds of hours of thought and work went into. The purpose of the whitepaper is to introduce Dapps, smart contracts, cryptocurrency and the blockchain to those who are new to these concepts, and to attract other communities to these technologies. Nothing was copied and pasted, and most of the whitepaper are my original writings. If you want to comment on specific things that I write and the content itself that would be more constructive rather than calling it all fluff. I think you underestimate the efforts I have taken to add value and promote the crypto space through this whitepaper.\n\nI respect your opinion that HPoP sounds like a buzz word, but what actually matters is the idea itself and it\'s introducing a new method for fundraising. At the very least it\'s encouraging people to think outside the box.\n\nRegarding the funds raised, like most projects the funding will likely be internal. By the way, we have an open network that people are welcome to join. I don\'t see how this is a bad thing. We ofcourse wish to support other 3rd party Dapp projects, many which have already applied. It all is based around choosing which projects are the most promising and add value. For this reason we have built a high quality team of advisors.\n\nWe do not force anyone to integrate our token or logo. If a project applies for funding then it is expected they will acknowledge our support. If they refuse to do so then it might not make sense for us to support them. Regarding our token, from our whitepaper: "In some cases Dapps won\xe2\x80\x99t require a token and there is no intention to force the use of Corona membership credits or any token for that matter where the dynamics don\'t make sense. Dapps which receive funding from Corona will bring value by promoting themselves as part of the Corona Network brand, and on the larger scale spreading the gospel of decentralization which is the most important aspect of the Corona Project." Reading the quote you referred to previosly, I agree is it is not properly articulated. I would have appreciated you mentioning this as we would have rephrased. To clarify, when we say we require Dapps we support to carry our branding, this simply means that they acknowledge us in some context. This is part of our business model. Regardin the token, when we say it "should incorporate the option" to use it, this is a recommendation. As I\'ve already written we don\'t force the use of our token if the Dapp creator doesn\'t feel it adds value.\n\nRegarding burning coins, it has the strong potential to attract members to our network and to bootstrap a strong community. That is why we are allowing it. You seem to claim that any attempt by us to make the fundraiser successful is bad. Yes, we are marketing it.\n\n"Gaining economic value due to contributions" has nothing to do with our token, and we never wrote that. I don\'t know what you are implying but nowhere do we claim our supporters will benefit financially by supporting the project. You might have misunderstood how our project works.\n\nNo we are not registered with enom, this is not true. Google "whoisguard" and you\'ll see we are registered with the biggest bitcoin accepting registrar in existence.\n\nAbout myself and Corona. I\'m a very private person like many others in this space who value privacy. I currently reside in Thailand. I am a Bitcoin early adopter and miner but during 2012-2014 I was less involved and had a steady job which kept me busy. I rediscovered my passion for cryptocurrency when I read about Ethereum last summer and that is when I started getting involved again and working on Corona. I will not disclose my personal contact information on reddit for obvious reasons, but you are more than welcome to email me team@corona.info and we can setup a time to chat, gladly. If you really want proof come meet me in person, I\'m happy to host you. I do not have a strong online presense as I am very privacy conscious, in fact just being as public as I am with this project has been a big personal challenge for me.\n\nCorona is not currently registered as an incorporated entity, we are in the process of establishing a legal entity in a crypto-friendly jurisdiction (likely Isle of Man). As many know setting up a company is very expensive as are all the legal considerations. We have been spending a lot of time and money trying to figure out how to best structure this type of initiative. The regulatory atmosphere is very unclear and the last thing I\'d want to do is open a US company and be subject to absurd rules like the bitlicense which I think is inhibiting innovation.\n\nI may have missed all your points, and with time I am happy to answer, however right now I am dealing with a much bigger problem so please be patient with my responses.\n\nSincerely,\n\nDaniel Greene': 0, "Since your saying the video will reappear at some point...Yep.

I also don\'t know company registration details. \n\nMy conversations prior to being added as an adviser were strictly in regards to the collaborative effort with Crypti. We had several really great conversations and he asked me if I would join the team as an adviser. The idea would be that I would help developers and teams that were working with Corona by critically analyzing their ideas, business models, and branding / marketing efforts. Since this type of thing is right up my alley and sounded fun, I agreed to help out.\n\nI can tell you that if it were a scam, it would be quite elaborate and not necessarily worth the amount of trouble that has gone into it. He has had countless discussions with myself and other members of the team to prepare for this launch and I honestly believe he has invested a lot of time to get to this point.

That is plenty of time for him to respond and clarify all of the things being brought up. If in a week or two you still haven\'t gotten any answers or you feel like it\'s just too ambiguous, then the red flags can come out. \n\nI just don\'t want to see everyone start throwing around terms like "scam" and saying that he is trying to swindle money out of pockets without giving him a chance to answer these important questions. If he really is honest and simply trying to bootstrap a new business model and idea, those types of associations get passed around pretty quickly online and could leave Corona dead in the water. \n\nIf you get satisfactory answers and after the AMA and some explaining, you feel like he\'s trustworthy, I think the idea behind Corona is one worth supporting. We have a lot of technologies being created out there but no real developers USING any of them. Between Eris, Augur, Factom, Storj, Crypti, Eth, etc, what we really need is a pipeline to support developers of traditional applications that can show them the benefits of incorporating smart contracts and block chain based technologies into traditional models.

We are reintroducing that concept. Are you claiming innovation is bad?\n\nCounterparty burned because they literally did not need the funds to fund development.  They funded out of the founders pockets and when they started the burn, the core protocol and software was already done and released.\n\nSo Counterparty burned because they wanted to issue the token, that was the important part, and didn\'t care about raising the money because they had already done the work.\n\nCorona on the other hand is supposedly entirely funding through this mechanism not just their own operation but a grant program for their ecosystem.  How on earth does it make sense to make burning available, when the reason for giving back the token is "adding value to the network" \n\nHow does someone burning add value to the corona network?

As a part of this ruling, the Supreme Court developed a test to see whether an opportunity constitutes an "investment contract." This test was called the "Howey Test."\n\n>An investment contract under the Howey Test was defined as follows:\n\n>1. an investment of money due to\n2. an expectation of profits arising from\n3. a common enterprise\n4. which depends solely on the efforts of a promoter or third party\n\n>What this meant for J. Howey, and for all real estate investors in the future, was that anytime you\'re searching for investors, no matter if the investor goes on the deed or has a mortgage, if the investor is relying on you to make their profits you are considered to be selling a security. The Howey Test set the standard for securities laws in raising money for real estate investments.\n\nSo.... I\'m pretty sure Corona ticks all four boxes of the howey test and is definitely a security under the federal definition.  You used a token to create a security.\n\nThe question of where are they legally incorporated basically doesn\'t matter because US law applies jurisdiction based on the buyers location not the sellers.  If they accept funds from any US customer, they\'re treated under US laws.': 5, "I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*.

If someone is addicted to drugs, is it a moral act to let them destroy themselves?\n\nYou aren\'t "letting them destroy themselves".

If someone is happier getting high and dying early instead of staying sober and living longer, that is their choice. We are not their parent or guardian. We do not make their decisions for them.\n\n* If someone is trying to kill someone else, is it a moral act to sell them cyanide?\n\nThese are two distinct acts. Selling someone cyanide and killing someone else. Selling cyanide is neither moral nor immoral, it\'s just a transaction. Society might shun the person selling cyanide to someone else if that person knows that it will be used in a murder, but the act has no morality attached to it.\n\n* Is it moral to sell kilos of cocaine to third party distributors which will then go on to fuel drug related violence in some of the poorest communities in the US and abroad?\n\nAgain, neither moral nor immoral.

I might have known that was likely to happen, but it\'s not my responsibility to police your behavior. You own your actions, not me.\n\n* Whether drugs should be legal (Yes, with caveats) \n\nNo caveats. There should be no laws of any kind regarding drugs. No law can get rid of the demand for drugs. That demand is there regardless of any nannying the government tries to do to us. What the laws do is try to affect supply. They make it riskier to sell drugs, which drives the price of drugs up, which makes it more profitable to sell them. Which means more people want to get into the market to fulfill the demand that already exists.\n\n* whether Ross operated in a way that mitigated harm to the users of the silk road.\n\nRoss isn\'t responsible for any harm that the users of the silk road brought to themselves. He simply provided a platform for people to conduct peaceful, voluntary, non-violent transactions. He is not responsible for the behavior of other people.\n\n* There is ample evidence that he did not, the site practiced almost no risk mitigation whatsoever, and was designed to expand the market without regard for the consequences to the users or anyone else.\n\nNor should he have to worry about any of that. Ross isn\'t your mom or anyone else\'s. Anyone who used the Silk Road service was a mature adult able to make his own informed decisions.\n\n* These types of actions have effects beyond the end user\n\nAll actions have effects beyond the end user.

A drug dealer deciding to not sell something is not called a site specific mitigation method. That happens in the real world too. The quack doctor they had was not a mitigation method, and people in a forum describing how to do drugs is not necessarily a mitigation method. Besides these forums and information sources have existed long before the silk road, their inclusion of communication between users is not some kind of novel method of drug safety.\n\nI'm saying there is a line between choice, and when rational choice is suspended after using hard drugs. You can disagree but the facts speak differently.": 1, 'I am not in the minority. There are many laws, and many people believe that certain laws are immoral. And some laws are just completely asinine.\n\nNor do I need to defend any position in this case. The law that currently exists is forced upon me, and everyone else, by a government that I never consented to and do not support. I believe that government is just a monopoly on the use of force, that the initiation of force or violence is immoral, and that voluntary institutions should replace the functions of government.\n\nTherefore, I do not believe the government has any right to impose its version of "law" upon us, though obviously some laws are nearly universal, like proscribing murder and rape. The penalties and the ways of dealing with violations of law are also dictated by government, and I do not believe that putting people into cages where they get raped and tortured for years is the best way of dealing with those violations.\n\nHowever, I do not need to defend my position, because I am not forcing my belief on anyone. The government, and those who support it, are forcing their beliefs on me, and forcing me to support it financially through taxes and to obey it, even when obeying it is immoral, and when government is the cause or the prime driver behind poverty, racism, war, sectarian violence, global climate change, and trillions of dollars of wasted productivity and resources.\n\n* And just to be clear: you think being an accessory to murder is not immoral?\n\nIt depends on what you mean by being an "accessory".

A small part of the holdings can be kept on bitcoin exchanges, if deemed necessary additional coins can be held on a multi-signature hot wallet and all holdings over a threshold must be kept in safe storage according to the limit and methods disclosed below. All changes to this policy must be approved by the board.\n\n**Limits**\n\n-Assets kept on individual bitcoin exchanges cannot be in excess of 1000 btc.\n\n-The total of assets kept on exchanges cannot exceed 4500 btc\n\n-The total of assets kept on exchanges and internal multi-signature hot-wallets cannot exceed 6000 btc or 10% of assets, whichever is largest. All remaining assets must be kept in safe storage.\n\n-At least 90 percent of bitcoin assets (except if assets are very small as defined above)) must be kept in safe storage.\n\n**Safe Storage**\n\nAt the latest when the these limits are reached XBT Provider will send bitcoin holdings to its safe Bitcoin address using P2SH (Pay to script hash) transactions. This way the company can send funds easily to a safe address while not disclosing any information regarding the receiving address or security precautions surrounding the private or public keys related to the address.\n\nIn order to access bitcoins on the secure address at least three out of five private keys needs to be used in conjunction in order to access any funds.

The block size 1MB and 20MB we are talking a lot is the maximum size of each new block of transactions.\n\nYeah I know, but a lot of people say that storage is so expensive that a bigger block size would be a problem.. And I can't understand this argument?": 2, "I think another big issue some are putting forward is the amount of time it takes for a 20mb block to get sent from one node to another on the network, once it is mined by a miner. This could, some theorize, make it more difficulty for slower internet connections to run the blockchain, in the day-to-day-new-blocks-moving-around-situation. \n\nAlso, it could open up the possibility for miners to attack the network by broadcasting junk blocks that are 20mb, that take a different miner time to validate, essentially *wasting* other miners' time and giving the attacker a few seconds of extra time to be mining on the good blocks since they aren't wasting time with their junk blocks.\n\nAdditionally. There seem to be a few that think we should make miners get paid more (higher tx fees) and that by keeping blocks small, people transacting on the blockchain will have to pay miners more, encouraging more miners to mine into the future.\n\nAnyhow, that's how I understand some of the issues besides the storage space issue.. Not that I agree these concerns should prevent raising the block size limit!": 1, 'People are complaining mainly about bandwidth and not storage.': 2, 'Ah ok... Really?
