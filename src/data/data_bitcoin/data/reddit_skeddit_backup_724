That seems like a risk/reward ratio too good to turn down.': 1, '[deleted]': 1, 'For a currency marked by volatility, Bitcoin has been remarkably stable against the U.S. Dollar over the last couple of months, essentially trading in a $320-$420 range. For those attracted to the virtual currency as a trading instrument due to massive volatility in the past that is no doubt a disappointment, but to those who are more interested in the blockchain as a game-changing payment system and the currency as a potential store of value in an inflationary environment, it is welcome news.\n\n\n\n\nThey would argue that this relative stability is a sign of maturity in the market, while those who look for the negative in anything to do with crypto-currencies would no doubt claim it is a sign of a growing indifference. To some extent, both may be right, but either way it is a good thing for Bitcoin\xe2\x80\x99s long term prospects.\n\nOf course, a trading range of 30 percent or so still represents enough volatility to keep even the most ardent currency trader occupied, but after establishing those levels of support and resistance BTC/USD has begun to narrow its own range and has spent the last week or so hovering around the mid-point of $370.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe above chart, from Bitcoincharts.com, also shoes volume bars at the bottom. As you can see, volume has been steady, low and declining for several weeks. Some of this may be down to the Thanksgiving holiday in the U.S., but it is more than a one-day phenomenon. What makes the lack of movement and declining volume of trades even more remarkable is that it has come at a time when commodity markets, most notably oil, have been under pressure. In many ways, Bitcoin\xe2\x80\x99s known and finite supply makes it more like a commodity than a currency, but as other commodities have lost ground to the Dollar, BTC has stabilized.\n\nCould it be, then, that as money has shifted away from inflated, risky assets such as oil and gold and run away from fiat currencies that are being deliberately devalued by central banks around the world, Bitcoin is seen by some as somewhat of a safe haven? That would certainly fit with the stability against the traditional safe haven, the U.S. Dollar.\n\nThat could be the case if not for one thing; that low volume. That would suggest that far from flocking to Bitcoin as a safe haven, global cash is essentially ignoring it. If that is the case then the next logical conclusion is that this $370 level represents the real value of BTC in USD terms at this point in its evolution. As anybody with a basic understanding of economics can tell you the price of something is a reflection of supply and demand and price stability comes when they are in balance. Given the evidence, the most likely scenario is that that is the case with Bitcoin right now.\n\nThe jump up in price to the giddy highs of over $1100 at the end of last year brought a lot of publicity and increased awareness to the Bitcoin market. This attracted more miners and effectively increased the rate of supply, so a drop in price was somewhat inevitable. Mining Bitcoin, though, gets more difficult, and therefore more costly, by design with the passage of time. The rate of supply is thus inexorably reduced, but the overall supply continues to increase. This price stability suggests that the overall supply is now at a point that is enough to satisfy demand but there is not an excess of coins in circulation.\n\nGiven that, the continuing decline in the rate of supply and a tendency for demand to increase as stability takes hold, there is, in the long term, only one way for BTC/USD to move...up.\n\nAll of this, of course, assumes that education and awareness continues and more and more people understand the benefit of making and receiving payments through the blockchain at minimal cost. It also assumes that there will be no en masse speculative selling by traders as maturity and the accompanying derivatives make shorting easier. If those two assumptions are correct we are left with a situation where owning at least some Bitcoin makes sense for every long term investor, not just believers and speculators.\n\nWhen asked over the holiday why that is the case, I put it this way. If you have $375 that you want to leave, in cash, for your great-grandchildren, you have a choice. You could lock the Dollars away somewhere in the certain knowledge that by the time that future generation accesses them they will be virtually worthless, or you could purchase 1 Bitcoin and store it in a digital wallet. If Bitcoin fails you have the same result, but if stability continues and is a sign of maturity then that future generation will be thanking you forever. That seems like a risk/reward ratio too good to turn down\n\n\n': 6, 'Don\'t read too much into that. The biggest bullshit gets posted on there.

Mining has the added benefit of securing the networks infrastructure as well. So if you are patient, have access to serious financial resources, why would you invest directly, causing much slippage, rather than invest into the network, driving down price temporarily allowing you to buy up more directly for less, while producing coins at a profit. Eventually the mining market will become saturated (once advances in ASIC tech slow down a bit) and you will receive the same or more coins from a $5million investment directly into BTC.

This presentation was bad. If I were to give a score for this, it would get a full fledged F. Almost the entire presentation just about regulation and the risks, not showing what the value proposition was. Because they spent so much time on risks, the little they spoke about what was so important about bitcoin was incoherent and rushed.\n\nThe guy in the middle was simply right, even if he was a bit aggressive in his view. I never took the meme seriously that the bitcoin community was its own enemy, until I saw this presentation. I mean, come on, comparing bitcoin to freaking nukes?! \n\nI get that risks should be looked at. And it's true, a lot of bitcoin fanatics overlook the potential for money laundering and all of that stuff. This stuff should be seriously considered. But the way they went on about it, is no longer balanced. And this is incredibly ironic, in light of how the lawyer stated that we should have an honest look at bitcoin. Alex and Riddel aren't realizing that they are falling into the same trap as the regulators often fall into. The trap of an oversensitivity to risk which all humans fundamentally suffer from.\n\nThe human species by nature is an unbalanced species, with an overemphasis on risk. If our ancestors weren't risk averse and were too overly positive, we would probably be extinct as a species. This is also seen in the price action. Negative news tends to have more of an influence on the price, while positive news is taken for granted and often has little influence (unless there's a constant stream of good news).\n\nBut this risk averseness of the human race tends to work against us at times. With every new innovation that came along, the first thing they noticed were the risks and not the benefits. The car was a dangerous, smelly murder machine and would help thieves to get away from law enforcement. Electricity would burn our houses down. The internet was a den of pornographers and thieves (thanks for the examples, Andreas!). Obviously these risks were overstated and paled in comparison to the advantages. By orders of magnitude. Why? Because people are incapable of seeing the pattern of evolutionary growth and are inherently bad at probability and statistics. The idea that something like money laundering is minor today, but would scale together with bitcoin is simply wrong on its face, for the same reason it was wrong to state that the internet is full of thieves and that supporting the internet would thus increase the number of thieves. In reality, technology reflects the values of society. Most of society is good, so that's the reason why the freedom of the internet didn't create a superden of thieves. Or that the car didn't cause an epidemic of bank robberies.\n\nWith how Alex and Riddel focused on risks, they did a good job demotivating a lot of people before they even began. Now the audience doesn't even want to start a company. They assumed that the audience already knew the why of bitcoin, just like they did. But the last question makes it blatantly obvious that they didn't even know the why of bitcoin. The regulator (and all normal people) will already fall into the trap of risk averseness. As an innovator, their job is to counteract that risk averseness by explaining the why of bitcoin (and not fall into the same trap as the regulator and regular people). It's not necessary to expend so much time on the risks. If they know the why, there will always be enough time for other events to explain the risks. \n\nWatch this video 50 times if one of the panelists is reading this comment, because it's apparent that you guys really need to learn how to sell a product:\n\nhttp://www.ted.com/talks/simon_sinek_how_great_leaders_inspire_action\n\nDoes that mean we should ignore the issue of money laundering or the like? No, but even if we couldn't solve the issue of money laundering right away, it wouldn't be a problem. Because bitcoin can scale to unparallelled levels that counteracts the negatives. We already established that something like money landering wouldn't scale. So even if that problem remains, we still have the major benefit of reaching an untapped market of 6 billion people, with the potential of lifting this group out of poverty. The potential benefit to GDP is MORE than just solving friction. If we can duplicate the miracle of Kenya (which gained 40% due to M-Pesa), we could add roughly 10-15% to world GDP in less than a decade (an estimation, discounting the added GDP of less friction). I'm not sure if people realize the magnitude of what adding 15% to world GDP would mean. Or that this initial 15% is but the beginning, because it weakens a bottleneck in the world economy. An economy is about money flowing into a circular manner, where the weakest link dictates the strength of the flow. That weakest link is the 3rd world. What do you think would happen to the world economy and how world GDP is affected if you manage to remove that bottleneck? The difference is simply transformative. Even the first world would be affected by this. Compared to this, the issue of money laundering simply pales in comparison (and it doesn't scale to that extent as well).\n\nIf you do not layout this value proposition, there is no reason for them to bother with bitcoin. Do not assume that they know what this value proposition is, even if you do.

If you use an exchange or "liquidity provider" like Coinbase, then you\'ve used off-chain transactions. ChangeTip is another example of an off-chain service. When bitcoin enters or leaves these systems, a transaction is logged on the block chain.
