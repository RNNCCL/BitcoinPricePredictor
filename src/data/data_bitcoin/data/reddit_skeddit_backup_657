We love being creative and exploring the different fetishes and aspects of sexuality, and videos are a great way for us to express ourselves!\n\nWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the most ridiculous experience with a bank you\xe2\x80\x99ve had?\n\nSB: For the longest time we had been depositing the USD cheques we receive from our payment processors and affiliate programs through a local bank (our main bank branch is about an hour away so we have to use one of their partner banks), and the cheques would clear like any other cheque within a few days and we\xe2\x80\x99d have access to the funds. One of these times (on a particularly large deposit of course!), the funds never went through!\n\nWe thought maybe it was just taking an unusually long time, but then in the mail we got photocopies of the cheques sent back to us from our bank! So we went into the branch to find out what happened, and apparently we\xe2\x80\x99ve never been supposed to be able to deposit USD cheques through an ATM (even though we\xe2\x80\x99d been doing it forever!), and the cheques had been sent back to each of the respective senders! This was ridiculous, since if they had just sent us back the original cheques we could have re-deposited them elsewhere, but nope, we had to contact each and every company and have them recut the cheques again!\n\nOn top of this, apparently the proper procedure is for them to hold the USD funds for 30 BUSINESS DAYS (fucking ridiculous!) and we have to physically deposit them at the branch. After lots of yelling, we just said screw it and cleared out our whole bank account into bitcoin. Oh, and to top it off when we were at the branch they realized that they\xe2\x80\x99d been charging us \xe2\x80\x9conly\xe2\x80\x9d $4/month in fees instead of the normal $15/month, so that\xe2\x80\x99s nice! Banks need to start dying off already! :)\n\nHave you seen a clear advantage to using Bitcoin?\n\nSB: Absolutely! Even under the best of circumstances, after paying $1000 for the privilege of accepting credit cards, we could only get a maximum of 80% of our sales as the rest would be taken in fees. 80% is even pretty good compared to the 60% we get from most places. With bitcoin we get 100%, instantly, and with no restrictions on where our customer is from. We get quite a few customers from places credit card companies don\xe2\x80\x99t like like Brazil, Saudi Arabia, Malaysia, the Philippines, etc. and bitcoin is the best way for them to send us money. Add to that the fact that we don\xe2\x80\x99t need to censor our work, and bitcoin is just the best thing ever for us.

Each node does not trust its peers, it autonomously verifies everything.  This is why the system is workable when it has no control over who uses it or how many nodes they spin up. Since each node verifies, it cannot be tricked.\n\n*Unfortunately there is no way to trustlessly provide the ordering of transactions so we have to use mining to provide for that.  The system attempts to incentivize miners to behave honestly, but it cannot force them to be completely honest.': 8, 'no because blocks currently (and have always so far) had room for zero fee transactions since we have never hit the blocksize limit to this point.\n\nthe only risk is that in the future when the reward subsidy decreases, lack of sufficient transaction fees (from non artificially limited block sizes) would mean less security, because the blocks would have smaller theoretical mining rewards, and thus less mining overall. \n\nI\'m not really worried about that, and here\'s one reason why. There is another aspect of "security" that is overlooked besides transaction fees and that is that holders of bitcoin also have incentive to maintain a sufficiently secure hashrate, the same way they have an incentive to run additional full nodes today (and many do) without any financial reward. Therefore, the more useful and valuable bitcoin is, the more those who reap the largest benefits from it will take steps to protect it. It isn\'t really tragedy of the commons there. \n\nWe don\'t know for sure what will happen as the block reward decreases and block size stays "open" as it is today. We do know what will happen if Bitcoin doesn\'t scale, and that is that it will become friendster and will be replaced by something else that does. \n\nA less useful Bitcoin is a more quickly replaced Bitcoin.

The point is to keep the network's nodes from becoming centralized.  If only a thousand entities are running nodes, it's much easier for a given Country to regulate the handful of nodes in their Country and control them, or for a region to do this with a bunch of Countries in tandem.\n\nCentralization of nodes has the potential to be as damaging as mining centralization, and I don't see the point of letting the block size become enormous and forcing centralization when there isn't even a problem with our 7 trx/second cap, presently.\n\nA more gradual increase makes much more sense and has no downside.

BTS is a cryptocurrency.\n\nbytemaster's idea of a DAC is complex and nuanced, and we have been moving away from it.  Largely because experience has shown it confuses people. \n\nThe idea is this:  When bitcoins are mined, the newly created bitcoins take value away from all the existing bitcoins.  The existing bitcoin holders have no say in this process, and it is questionable whether the services provided by miners are worth the many millions of dollars worth of BTC the system is giving to those miners.\n\nBitcoin's actions are like a company that is issuing new shares (bitcoins) to pay employees (miners), without any input from shareholders (people who already own bitcoin) about whether the services (security / decentralization / fork resolution) provided by those employees (miners) is worth the amount the shareholders (bitcoin holders) are paying (indirectly through the decrease in value of existing bitcoins whenever new bitcoins are created).\n\nBitShares was originally conceived as a cryptocurrency that allows the existing coin holders to decide, in a decentralized way, whether to issue new coins, how many new coins to issue, and the purpose for which those coins will be issued.\n": 5, "I think I can summarize: Your moving the exchange's database (order book) out of the exchange and putting it on a blockchain.  The FIAT remains as-is...\n\nIt may not be obvious, but this means that instead of the exchange holding the private key, the customers hold there own private keys.  Most of the problems with exchanges involved cooking the books (you can't do that on the blockchain) and the theft of a large balance (well, now the balances will be held by each individual so this becomes a much more targeted attack).

I hate mining with a passion. I hate the waste, I hate the progression towards centralisation for efficiency.\n\nThe fact that everyone isn't supporting research in to PoS type systems and that many are actively outright dismissing the concept of PoS disgusts me. The idea that people seem to be happy with the amount of money that gets burned by mining is crazy.\n\n": 3, "Wow, you have done your home work.. Nice references too.  I'm excited, I can't wait to get the IOUs in my wallet and out of the exchanges.  Once step in the right direction.  Anyone in there right mind should bend over backwards to help you achieve such a selfless goal for the better good of the community.": 4, 'I\'m really interested in this idea but am having a hard time really fully understanding it. This first step is particularly confusing me. \n\n1.  All I have is fiat USD and I want some BTC. I then find an exchange "gateway" of which there will be many. I then somehow purchase gatewayUSD. (here I am already confused. How will I purchase GatewayUSD? Once I purchase GatewayUSD isn\'t my money just as at risk as it ever was buying BitstampUSD? Why isn\'t the gateway just as accountable to strict KYC laws as any other exchange?)\n\n\n': 2, "You'd could likely use the GatewayUSD as a pass through to bitUSD by trading that pair on the market in the BTS client if you are looking to be free from a single point of failure other than an irreversible blockchain exploit (i.e. no counterparty risk). In this way your exposure to the risk would be minimal, only while you were waiting for your orders to be filled from GatewayUSD to bitUSD.\n\n On and off ramps that allow for a conversion into and out of fiat have yet to be operational, those are the missing link for purchasing GatewayUSD like IOUs. And the gateway is likely accountable for the strict KYC laws still, which is why they would issue their own IOU user issued asset that they control to keep track of their own ledger. Ideally an on ramp that goes directly into bitUSD would be preferred, but it all depends on having high liquidity and low spreads in the markets to make that feasible. \n\nI'm not an expert so I wouldn't take my statements to be fact, just my own interpretation of how this might work.": 1, "> here I am already confused. How will I purchase GatewayUSD?\n\nthe same way you get money to any exchange. ACH/Wire/Cash deposit.  Today your deposits on any exchange are just an ExchangeIOU-USD\n\n> Once I purchase GatewayUSD isn't my money just as at risk as it ever was buying BitstampUSD?\n\nYes, you have to trust the gateway to honor the IOU, just like you have to trust BitStamp today to honor their deposits.  I think the difference is that once your past the gateway and exchanged your IOU for whatever asset your looking for, that risk is over and your now free to trade on the decentralized exchange. only fiat deposit and withdrawl is at risk of the gateway, so a very limited time frame.  You can go back to USD without leaving the decentralized exchange by using bitUSD\n\n> Why isn't the gateway just as accountable to strict KYC laws as any other exchange?  \n\nI think they will be.  I think the  difference is the exchange no longer has to do all the accounting themselves, nor do they have to run the orderbook so it's much more simple and KYC/AML control requirement on the gatewayIOU asset are essentially turn key, managed on blockchain. \n\nThats my understanding anyway.  I'm also trying to figure it out.": 3, "BTS core developer here. \n\n> So that leaves just the simple task of changing fiat to an IOU fiat, and this IOU is listed on the decentralized exchange as well and can be traded?\n\nYes, that's the idea.\n\n> Does this mean that anyone can operate a gateway in a sort of turn key simplified fashion?\n\nYes.  We are currently testing features which will help gateways comply with the regulatory requirements to operate legally in the US.\n\n> so there might be 1000's of gateways instead of the 3 or 4 major exchanges we have today? Thereby reducing the risk of any one mega gateway/exchange being compromised and everyone losing?\n\nThat's part of the idea.\n\nThe other part is that there are two reasons people give their dollars and bitcoins to gateways like BitStamp.\n\nThe first reason is to get money into or out of the old fashioned banking system, for example selling bitcoins to pay taxes, rent, or food when your government, landlord or grocery store doesn't accept bitcoin.  Or buying bitcoins with your income from a job that pays you by cash, check, or direct deposit.\n\nThe second reason is to get exposure to the value of bitcoin or USD.  In this case you keep your bitcoins on deposit, and as soon as the price starts to drop, you sell them.  Or maybe you sell them as soon as the price rises above a certain level.  The point is, because of deposit delays, you have to keep your bitcoins on deposit in order to be able to trade them quickly.  And that means there are lots of IOU's and the exchange wallets containing the bitcoins backing the IOU's are a tempting target.\n\nThe second reason is more or less completely eliminated by our system, because you can trade your gateway-issued IOU's for BitUSD or BitBTC which are decentralized cryptocurrencies -- not IOU's backed by a particular gateway.  How we ensure that 1 BitUSD is always worth about $1, and BitBTC is always worth about 1 BTC, is [quite interesting and innovative](http://bytemaster.bitshares.org/guest/2014/12/22/How-BitShares-Works/).": 3, 'Nice research!  Yes you are correct BTC38 accepts bitCNY as if it were real CNY and actually gives a small bonus for bitCNY depositors! \n\nA BTC/BTS gateway is under active development:\nhttps://bitsharestalk.org/index.php?topic=12317.0\n\nThe first gateways are coming online soon (in a few months there should be a bunch of them).  At the moment the way into the system is with BTS from bter or btc38, but that will soon change.\n\n': 2, 'If it actually can work. Unless you are full reserve backing I think not.

Also BTC38 accepts BitCNY deposite to CNY with 1:1 rate. This is rather amazing, I don't know why you guys didn't mention this in your bitshares' multiple advertisement posts ( I could be wrong, I may have missed that). Just my 2 cents, giving an example like the BitCNY gateway  and BTC38 acceptance is much better than your thousands of long blogs.\n\nI just know little about BTS but I think the gateway is the most important thing that should be built.
