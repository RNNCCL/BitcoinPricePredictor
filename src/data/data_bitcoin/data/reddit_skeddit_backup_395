Thus, even when we observe empirical data flying in the face of economic law (such as an increase in minimum wage not resulting in an observable decrease in demand for labor); this does not negate these laws.  It simply lets us know that we likely could have expected (in the case of the minimum wage hike) higher employment than what we observed if we had not had a minimum wage hike.  Or in the case of the business cycle and recovery; if we observe some recovery under a fiat system and fiscal and monetary stimulus regime. . . this does not tell us anything other than that we could have expected a more robust recovery had markets been allowed to clear and the deflation allowed to happen.  We know, a priori, that these policies are destructive and we can only thank our lucky stars that we are so insanely productive as to be able to maintain a reasonably comfortable standard of living through the busts and the malaise of government administered "recovery".\n\nThe laws of economics are known and predictable forces, which are almost universally in play. . . but not solely responsible for observed phenomena; they are in play alongside many other variables.

Anything contrary to this actually goes against what users expected when they started using Bitcoin, there has always been space available for blocks to grow these last 6 years and suddenly devs want to force the Bitcoin's transaction behaviour to change by changing the nature of block space from always available, to always full. Most devs have continually stalled with excuses for various reasons (explained in the link above). \n\nThe stalling, excuses, unfounded fear and general belligerence is unacceptable and demonstrates that they really have no idea what to do. Only a few devs have tackled the problem directly, and those that have, have remarkably been criticised for making the network vulnerable. It's absurd. Nothing I have read so far indicates that increasing the block size is going to be detrimental to the operation of the network, but we continually have people harp on about how the Lightning Network (LN) will somehow solve everything when it is quite clear that it will only relieve a small burden of transactions from the blockchain *at best*. LN is false hope but it allows devs to avoid actually addressing the problem, it's quite clear that many devs are either too afraid to commit to making the changes necessary for Bitcoin to grow as it has, or are far more keen to bandaid over the solution with halfassed offchain solutions that may be years away from being functional, ready, or even viable. \n\ntl;dr ELI5: Even smart people can do and say stupid things.

As it becomes clear that one of the \xe2\x80\x9ccoins\xe2\x80\x9d is valued much higher than the other, stakeholders such as miners, full node operators, and Bitcoin companies will end up choosing the fork with the higher value. As more of these stakeholders choose the higher value fork, the value difference between the two forks will diverge at an increasing rate, ultimately resulting in one fork having basically no value as users rush to sell all their coins in that fork for ones in the more valuable fork. This process should happen quite quickly as it is a positive feedback loop.

All this in the name of adoption at all costs, while bolstering "Bitcoin 2.0" companies alongside blockchain API providers like BlockCypher.com and Chain.com which earn more cash the harder it is for you to run a full node.\n\nLitecoin would be freaking DUMB not to champion themselves as having lighter weight full nodes for superior levels of privacy.

This may not seem like an important distinction, but it lies at the heart of why the big blocks proposal is so divisive.\n\nHard forks are very, very uncommon. In fact, there\'s only one incident in Bitcoin\'s entire history that even comes close to a hard fork update. It was a rather boring update that added a checksum as a security fix. It was only deployed after it was determined that no network nodes would be adversely affected.\n\nhttps://bitcoin.org/en/alert/2012-02-18-protocol-change\n\nMining the first big block splits the network into two groups: patched nodes and unpatched nodes. Patched nodes accept big or small blocks, but unpatched nodes only accept small blocks. As patched nodes grow their side of the fork, unpatched nodes reject every one of its blocks. If the unpatched nodes grow their chain more slowly, the patched side of the network will reject all of its blocks because the other side of the fork has more proof-of-work.\n\nThe same coin can be spent on either fork. Otherwise known as double spending, this is the very thing the network was designed to prevent. This is not merely a theoretical possibility. It happended during the 2013 accidental chain split event (which was not a hard fork update, and was not in the least contentious):\n\nhttps://bitcoinmagazine.com/3668/bitcoin-network-shaken-by-blockchain-fork/\n\nThere\'s a highly questionable assumption that this split would resolve itself quickly. It can instead persist for a very long time - possibly for the foreseeable future. Making no decision puts you on the unpatched side of the network.\n\nThere\'s another highly questionable assumption that the patched nodes will eventually "win" in the sense that the unpatched side of the network will wither away eventually. During the 2013 chain split incident, it was the fork with the most proof-of-work that disappeared.\n\nMiner consensus leading up to the hard fork update means nothing here. Miners can switch at will between either chain, guided by profit potential, good-intentions, or malice. Developer consensus is also largely irrelevant. They can switch sides as well, or leave altogether. Whatever the outcome, node operators will run the software they want to run. To the extent that exchanges like Shapeshift support coins on both forks, then trading between the two cryptocurrencies will be possible.\n\nGiven the uncertainties, it would not be surprising to see miners mining both sides as a hedge. Users may hedge their bets as well. Merchants would need to run both types of nodes to detect double spending. All of these things would increase the time during which both cryptocurrencies co-exist.\n\nA hard fork update is, simply put, unprecedented. To miss this point is to miss the crux of the debate.\n\n': 5, 'BIP 66 is a soft fork.': 2}, ("Withdrawal Regrets Club, let's cry on each others shoulders..", 0): {'Easy come easy go\n\n/u/changetip 1 day of reddit gold': 1, '[deleted]': 5, 'Thanks man those words mean a lot :)': 2, "I'm with you bro.

Thank for for acknowledging that we did attribute many things.\n\nThere have been other things I\'ve been made aware of since that I would have also included-- e.g. Alex Mizrahi posted some thoughts in a very similar space--, though I don\'t believe your posts would be among them:\n\n> The result of this thought experiment was [Bencoin](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=10970.0). Bencoin was simply a method to deposit Bitcoins, off-chain, with a trusted third party representing a separate more localized economy, while still being able to withdraw them at will.\n\nYour post is light on technical details;  but what I understand from it is that you\'re describing  a scheme where users generate a private key, encrypt it and send it to a singular trusted third party bank, then send coins to the corresponding scriptpubkey.\n\nBecause the user can retain the private key, I fail to see how this accomplishes anything at all: The user cannot securely trade the coin within the bank because after relinquishing ownership of the coin (inside the bank) they could revoke the backing coin at any time by spending it out from under the bank; unless -- of course-- the bank immediately sweeps the coin on spend and considers the transaction non-final until it is well confirmed; in which case the user could have just skipped dealing with the bank and its security problems in the first place.\n\nSometimes its the case that people have additional details kicking around in their head that make what they\'ve expressed publicly into something much more useful, but no one is a mind reader!\n\n> by the depositor, and cannot be spent by the third party without authorization of the depositor.\n\nNone of your posts actually describe this combination and application-- but that particular kind of locked refund multiparty escrow scheme for zero confirmation payments was described in detail years prior by Peter Todd and myself (and almost certainly many others); and was subsequently implemented by the Green Address wallet and put into production for allowing instant payments; more than a year before the bond post you\'re linking to there.  Improving the security of this kind of protocol was a [specifically cited application](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0065.mediawiki#Micropayment_Channels) of OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY (which you suggest using) in its BIP draft.\n\nThese things, however, are not related to sidechains.  E.g. Where is the chain? How does it connect? what is the relationship?  \n\nTo me it appears that you are conflating completely unrelated TTP-based scaling proposals with (pegged) sidechains, and then complaining that there some people do not believe decenteralized pegged sidechains are (much of) a scaling solution.  My response is that unrelated TTP scaling proposals are unrelated to what we described in the pegged sidechains whitepaper.  If you want to instead use "sidechains" as an umbrella for all complex technology or crytpgoraphic protocols, then I agree there are probably scaling things there; but I\'m also not likely to have any idea what you\'re talking about at all!\n\n> And the short leap from Bencoin to Bitcoin Bonds to one-way pegged Sidechains is, I think, obvious.\n\nEven with the links to your posts; these things still appear _completely_ unrelated to me; but that said, if was so obvious why didn\'t you describe it these obvious leaps? Or even their implications? Whid didn\'t you formalize them to any extent? Why didn\'t you implement them?\n\n> rather seize control of this idea and keep it for themselves, instead of allowing for the possibility that the scalability benefits of Sidechains or similar be opened to the entire Bitcoin community\n\nAnd yet you fail to describe any method by which someone could possibly "seize control" of such general ideas, especially while deploying them for people to use (since any of this stuff is obviously worthless if unused), and super-especially while [giving away](https://github.com/ElementsProject/elements) many tens of thousands of lines of code implementing them under permissive licensing.  If you\'d like to talk about insulting; I suggest you begin with your conduct on this point.\n\nAs an aside, you\'re making a lot of "blockstream employee this/that" claims without providing any links. So I\'m at a loss as to that precisely you\'re talking about there, but evaluating the links you\'ve provided here I can at least say that I feel comfortable saying that I see no connection between what you\'re describing and the pegged sidechains idea we described in the whitepaper.\n\n> And there are likely [several ways](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=941331.msg10461645#msg10461645) to implement them in order to enable Bitcoin to scale in a flexible and completely voluntary fashion.\n\nI hope people follow that link, because it has a nice description as to why decentralized pegged sidechains are not generally scalablity solution; courtesy Pieter-- from back in January; long before the current blocksize debate.  The core point of is is that so long as you\'re talking about the same kind of decenteralized system the same kind of scaling/security tradeoffs remain. \n\nIf you want to talk about trusted party/federation systems-- then indeed those can scale enormously, though thats not the subject of the Pegged Sidechains whitepaper (except in an appendix), and not a _general_ answer to scaling bitcoin, because it only does so while trading off some of Bitcoin\'s paramters-- but is well known that by handing your coins over to a trusted third party you can transact at with high volume as this is something that every Bitcoin exchange does.\n': 1, 'My question is: why should sidechains be forced on the users of Bitcoin by an artificial technical constraint, rather than grow naturally to fill a need not met by the base Bitcoin protocol (like the scenario you describe above)?': -3, 'I don\'t have time to respond to all of this right now, but I\'ll just say that the reason I never implemented "Sidechains" proper is the same reason that **you** haven\'t implemented them, and have instead concentrated on monopolizing Bitcoin core developers -- making the necessary changes requires commit access to Bitcoin core.  Implementing them anywhere else is pointless.\n\nAs for the others, I did implement the Bitcoin Bonds, what I consider the direct precursor to one-way pegged Sidechains.  (The critical difference being that a pegged Sidechain takes the additional step of creating a mirror coin on the Sidechain once the Bond is created, the same way that Bencoins are issued whenever Bitcoins are deposited with the trusted third party.)  And you know this, because you were chatting with me in the #bitcoin-dev channel when I broadcast the first Bitcoin Bond, witnessed it and helped answer some of my questions.  It\'s still right there [on the blockchain](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=156964.msg1664646#msg1664646) for anyone to see.\n\nRegardless, I\'m not here to bicker over details.

Although with off-chain services like Coinbase, etc., the fee *is* quite literally '0'.": 1, 'The relevant passage, directly quoted from the book:\n> At the Allen & Co. conference, Wences was given one of the speaking slots before Jeff Bezos and Warren Buffett took the stage. Wences gave what was becoming a standard talk, beginning with the history of money, and going on to discuss the potential for Bitcoin to provide financial services to poor people who had long been shut out. He touched on Xapo only briefly, at the end.\n\n> **After Wences came down and took a seat with Belle, [Amazon CEO] Bezos said from the stage that it was the kind of talk that kept him coming to these events.**\n\n> In the hallway walking to lunch, after the Bezos-Buffett conversation, Wences spotted Bill Gates, who had been notably reticent about Bitcoin. Wences knew that Gates\xe2\x80\x99s multibillion-dollar foundation had been making a big push to get people in the developing world connected financially, and Wences approached him to explain why Bitcoin might help his cause.\n\n> As soon as Wences broached the topic, Gates\xe2\x80\x99s face clouded over, and there was a note of anger in his voice as he told Wences that the foundation would never use an anonymous money to further its cause. \n\n> Wences was somewhat taken aback, but this was not the first time he had been challenged by a powerful person. He quickly said that Bitcoin could indeed be used anonymously\xe2\x80\x94but so could cash. And Bitcoin services could easily be set up so that users were not anonymous.\n\n> He then spoke directly to the work that Gates was doing, and noted that the foundation had been pushing people in poor countries into expensive digital services that came with lots of fees each time they were used. The famous M-Pesa system allowed Kenyans to hold and spend money on their cell phones, but charged a fee each time.\n\n> **\xe2\x80\x9cYou are spending billions to make poor people poorer,\xe2\x80\x9d Wences said.**\n\n> Gates didn\xe2\x80\x99t just roll over. He vigorously defended the work his foundation had already done, but Gates was less hostile than he had been a few moments earlier, and seemed to evince a certain respect for Wences\xe2\x80\x99s chutzpah. \n\n> Wences saw the crowd that was watching the conversation, and knew he had to be careful about antagonizing Bill Gates, especially in front of others. But Wences had another point he wanted to make. He knew that back in the early days of the Internet, Gates had initially bet against the open Internet and built a closed network for Microsoft that was similar to Compuserve and Prodigy\xe2\x80\x94it linked computers to a central server, with news and other information, but not to the broader Internet, as the TCP/IP protocol allowed. \n\n> \xe2\x80\x9cTo me it feels like you are trying to get the whole world connected with something like Compuserve when everyone already has access to TCP/IP,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, and then paused anxiously to see what kind of response he would get. What he heard back from Gates was more than he could have reasonably hoped for. \n\n> **\xe2\x80\x9cYou know what? I told the foundation not to touch Bitcoin and that may have been a mistake,\xe2\x80\x9d Gates said, amicably. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are going to call you.\xe2\x80\x9d**\n\n> After Wences got back to California, he received an email from the Gates Foundation, looking to set up a time to talk. Not long after that, Gates made his first public comments praising at least some of the concepts behind Bitcoin, if not the anonymity. \n\n> And so Bitcoin and its believers attracted one more person who was willing to give this new technology a look, and remain open to the possibility that the whole thing wasn\xe2\x80\x99t, at least, entirely crazy.

But you must push the transaction to mempool yourself (or in other word you must "send" your transaction to the network for nTimeLocked Bitcoins when time limit is surpassed, because nobody is holding your transaction data for you until the moment came). If you lost that transaction & private key from wallet, you are losing your funds. If you lost your private key & saved your nTimeLocked transaction signature/script you can unlock that transaction because it was already signed with your private key & you\'re holding the whole nTimeLock script with signature of the transaction. Basically this means that you must hold your transaction information yourself in this case in order to make this future contract work.\n\nWith the CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY blockchain gets new function: ability to include to blockchain a certain message that will process the transaction in future **without your participation**. So in case if you lost your private key, and also lost your CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY transaction hashes & script, the blockchain is still going to process your transaction in the cloud without your participation at the future date which you specified. In this case even if you\'ve lost transaction information or your HDD crashed/papers burned whatever happened, contract will work anyway & you can\'t touch this Bitcoins, because they will be locked, almost like frozen for specified moment.\n\nUse cases for CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY e.g. is inheritance - e.g. you can give blockchain programming instruction to release your funds from your wallet in 2040 when you\'re sure dead & when your children need your money.': 4, "Summary\n=======\n\nCHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY\n-------------------\n\n1. Inheritance of coins by someone else in future\n2. Implement micro payments\n: Consider two participants Customer(C) and Provider(P). Customer has to pay for a service whose maximum value is $100 for one month. Time at beginning of transaction is T. Problem: Normally if every small transaction has to be in the block chain, unnecessary increase in blockchain and transaction fee penalty has to paid which may be proportionally higher considering the transaction itself is small. Instead a below scheme will require publishing only two transactions to the blockchain.\n  1. Initial Deposit: Generate the following transaction signed by C and put in blockchain \n      * Input is $100 from C\n      * Output can be redeemed by the following script\n\n             if CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY(T+31days):\n                pubKey(C) can redeem\n             else:\n                both pubKey(C) and pubKey(P) together can redeem\n\n  2. When C uses a micro service. E.g. makes a phone call. Lets say C uses $1 worth of service on day 2. C generates the below transaction and sends to P.\n      * Input is the initial deposit transaction\n      * Outputs:\n          1. $1 for pubKey(P)\n          2. $99 can be redeemed by following script\n                 if CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY(T+30days):\n                     pubKey(C) can redeem\n                 else:\n                     both pubKey(C) and pubKey(P) together can redeem\n      * Note this transaction need not be put into block chain immediately. It can be put anytime before T+30. This is generated by C signed and sent to P. P should sign it for it to become valid.\n   3. When C users another $2 worth of service on day 3, and the previous transaction was not published by P, C sends another transaction:\n      * Input is the initial deposit transaction\n. \n      * Outputs:\n          1. $3 for pubKey(P)\n          2. $97 can be redeemed by following script\n                 if CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY(T+29days):\n                     pubKey(C) can redeem\n                 else:\n                     both pubKey(C) and pubKey(P) together can redeem\n      * Note the input is again the initial deposit transaction and the transaction need not be published to blockchain immediately. P may choose to publish it once in ten days. The previous unpublished transaction is no longer required and should not be published. \n   4. If P happens to publish the previous transaction, C should use that as input next time he needs to pay. C is guaranteed any unspent money he will get back after one month. P is guaranteed that C cannot double spend the deposit before one month, so he doesn't have to publish each and every small payments. He can publish on the last day the last transaction and get his fee. Only compromise is if the P is bad, C gets his money locked up for one month.\n": 1, "Since it's an opcode you can use complex rules like before a certain date, 2of3 can sign (the parents + child for example), after a certain date only the child needs to sign.
