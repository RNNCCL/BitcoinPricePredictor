It\'s like a mantra.  Blockchain = good, Bitcoin = irrelevant.\n\nThere is also this idea that blockchains can be repurposed and used independent of Bitcoin by centralized entities like banks and governments.\n\nThese people don\'t understand how blockchains work.\n\nTo the first point: a blockchain is secured by miners who compete with each other to profit from building the blockchain.  Without a valuable coin, miners will not build a valuable infrastructure to mine it.  Without a valuable mining infrastructure, the decentralized mining network is trivial to attack by a wealthy attacker.\n\nThis is the primary issue with alts: not that they embody bad ideas, but rather that the value proposition of (1) a highly competitive mining network, (2) mining a comparatively valuable coin with (3) relatively high capitalization *dwarfs* the value proposition of any new "altcoin ideas."\n\nThis is why in my opinion Bitcoin will remain the dominant blockchain / cryptocurrency until new technology is discovered that literally renders blockchains irrelevant.  New technologies will be layered on top of the existing protocol which will evolve slowly and purposefully.  *See: Linux kernel; TCP/IP, SMTP, HTTP protocols.*\n\n**TL;DR: the security of a blockchain is directly proportional to the value of its coin, and bootstrapping the value proposition of a decentralized coin is really, really hard.**\n\nThis immediately invokes the second point that needs refuting: that centralized operators like banks or governments could make a coin and control it by owning the mining network.  The theory is that they would operate miners inside a "closed" network, and distribute the mined coins however they prefer.   Like a "DollarCoin."  There is also the theory that businesses etc. might spin up their own coins to create "non-money" blockchains - like blockchains that just store contracts - independent of Bitcoin, the idea being that the mining network would be closed and secure within a "ring of trust."  I think both ideas are absurd.\n\nWhy is this absurd?  Because the minute you assume a centralized mining network operating within a secure "ring of trust", there\'s really no reason to use a blockchain at all.  Standard SQL databases and old-fashioned IT of the sort that banks already use *are actually better adapted for solving problems of centralized computing within a ring of trust.* \n\nBlockchains solve the problem of *decentralized* money and *decentralized* computing.  The minute you assume a "secure ring of trust" the benefit of a blockchain completely disappears, and it actually becomes a liability.\n\n**TL;DR: Using blockchains for centralized solutions is like attaching a carburetor and mufflers to your horse to get more "horsepower".**': 44, 'Bitcoin is secured by miners.

Others dream of winning the Nobel Prize for medicine or organising industry-changing takeovers. Oliver Bussmann dreamed of being a chief information officer \xe2\x80\x93 a job title that was only just becoming current when he was studying.\n\n\n>Photo credit: Robert Huber\nIn April last year it became reality, when German-born Bussmann was appointed CIO of Swiss bank UBS. But his route into the job wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the normal one.\n\n>Although Bussmann, now aged 48, knew about finance and technology, he had not been working for a bank for more than a decade. Bussmann was working as CIO of German software multinational SAP and, with nearly 11,000 Twitter followers, a nice line in Buzzfeed-style blog posts and two spells working in San Francisco, he didn\xe2\x80\x99t fit the stereotype of a senior bank executive.\n\n>Speaking in UBS\xe2\x80\x99s headquarters in Zurich, Bussmann said: \xe2\x80\x9cDigitalisation is one of the threats to the financial services industry and if you have someone who comes from the hi-tech world, someone that is part of that change \xe2\x80\x93 trying to automate and digitalise things, embrace new technologies and how to leverage them internally \xe2\x80\x93 it\xe2\x80\x99s a good starting point.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n>Not only does he acknowledge and embrace the impact that technology could have on financial services, he is also well aware of the fresh, aggressive competition it could bring.\n\n\n>He said: \xe2\x80\x9cWe saw other industries where outsiders came in and used technology to come up with new business models and the rest of the industry fell. And it is possible, from my perspective, that somebody, a hi-tech firm like Facebook or Google, will go after the retail banking business to provide certain payment services or investment services. If you look at Alibaba and Tencent in China, they are going in that direction.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n>(Tencent is a Chinese internet firm that offers messaging and social networking, while Alibaba is an e-commerce company. Both are moving into areas that traditionally would be the preserve of banks.)\n\n>To push change at UBS, he led the creation of a system of internal working groups devoted to developing innovative technology projects across the bank, an idea he imported from SAP.\n\n>These so-called innovation spaces have dedicated funds to finance their operations and mix people from both the IT and the business divisions of the bank. The working groups also include experts from outside UBS, such as venture capitalists or representatives of fintech start-ups. There are currently 100 ideas in the pipeline.\n\n>Bussmann said: \xe2\x80\x9cYou have to establish an environment to understand what themes out there may have an impact on your business. In our business, these mega trends could be robot advisory, everything client facing, the use of big data and the whole cryptocurrency topic.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n>That\xe2\x80\x99s quite a list. The trend he puts at the top of his list is blockchain, the underlying technology behind Bitcoin, which he says is the megatrend with the biggest potential to bring change to the financial services sector.\n\n>Many across the industry are convinced that the blockchain can be adapted to verify and record a wide range of real-world financial transactions, such as transmitting international payments and other assets or clearing securities, all using a database that is distributed across the internet yet still held secure.\n\n>The Bank of England recognised the technology\xe2\x80\x99s potential in a report in September, describing it as a \xe2\x80\x9csignificant innovation\xe2\x80\x9d that could have \xe2\x80\x9cfar-reaching implications\xe2\x80\x9d.\n\n>However, the association with Bitcoin, with its reputation for facilitating shady payments, means few executives inside large established financial institutions want to talk about it. A survey in Fintech News issue 1 showed those inside large financial institutions preferred to talk about Big Data and other less disruptive technologies.\n\n>However, Bussmann maintains: \xe2\x80\x9cI believe \xe2\x80\x93 and this is my personal view \xe2\x80\x93 that blockchain technology will not only change the way we do payments but it will change the whole trading and settlement topic.\xe2\x80\x9d Bussmann believes that blockchain technology has potential to trigger \xe2\x80\x9cmassive\xe2\x80\x9d simplification of banking processes and cost structure.\n\n>He said: \xe2\x80\x9cWhen somebody with a strong brand and security level establishes it as a reliable service, then the whole industry will follow. That is my personal prediction.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n>While blockchain is a technology that threatens revolution in banks\xe2\x80\x99 payment and back-office functions, robot advisory \xe2\x80\x93 automated wealth management \xe2\x80\x93 is a trend that could hit their asset management units. It is also a trend that threatens to hit close to home for UBS, the world\xe2\x80\x99s leading wealth manager, with $1.96 trillion of assets under management, according to research from London-based consultancy Scorpio Partnership.\n\n>Over the past few years, a number of young companies across the world, such as US-based Wealthfront or UK-based Nutmeg, have been seeking to shake up the wealth management industry by leveraging technology to provide tailored portfolio building without the cost of human advisers.\n\n>Bussmann said: \xe2\x80\x9cThe whole advisory business is in the middle of a big change. How you provide this automated investment advice to a customer is the key question that will involve the whole industry.\xe2\x80\x9d UBS already has the technological capability to offer automated investment advice, Bussmann said. The insight from automated processing is, however, currently being used as a tool by its investment managers and not offered directly to clients online.\n\n>How these trends will unfold and which banks will be able to successfully embrace them remains to be seen, but Bussmann can rely on a track record helping large organisations stay abreast of digital disruption.\n\n>Those confident in his abilities include tech veteran Maynard Webb, founder of Webb Investment Network and board member of Salesforce.com, Yahoo! and LiveOps, who said Bussmann \xe2\x80\x9cis one of the most innovative CIOs that I\xe2\x80\x99ve had the privilege of working with\xe2\x80\x9d.\n\n>Bussmann joined SAP in Frankfurt in 2009 and focused on helping the firm translate emerging technology trends into concrete products.\n\n>When the first iPad was released in April 2010, for example, at the time when it was not clear whether tablets were going to be a hit, he was quick to realise the potential for enterprise use. By September, 1,500 managed and secure iPads were deployed within SAP, enabling the firm\xe2\x80\x99s developers to test-drive the new device. Among other things, this resulted in the creation of enterprise mobile app store, giving SAP employees access to more than 100 business apps.\n\n>It was around the same time that Bussmann \xe2\x80\x93 who two years ago was dubbed the \xe2\x80\x9cmost social\xe2\x80\x9d chief information officer of a Fortune 250 company by software provider harmon.ie \xe2\x80\x93 made his real foray on social media.\n\n>He now boasts nearly 11,000 followers on Twitter and more than 17,800 followers on LinkedIn. He writes blogs and has his own website, although he admits that his activity has somewhat decreased since moving to financial services, a much more regulated industry.\n\n>Innovation and social media are, however, not the only things keeping him going. In line with its cost-reduction goals, UBS is in the process of simplifying its legacy IT systems and reducing the number of applications it runs on. The task is made all the more challenging by the increasing workload on IT systems created by a raft of post-crisis regulations.\n\n>Prior to SAP, Bussmann spent nine years at global insurer and asset manager Allianz, where he held senior technology roles both in Germany and in San Francisco. He first moved to the Bay Area in 2000 at the height of the dotcom bubble.\n\n>The time in San Francisco, of course, also allowed him to benefit from the proximity with Silicon Valley\xe2\x80\x99s community of world-leading technology start-ups, he says. He moved back to Germany after three years, then Allianz moved him to San Francisco again in 2006.\n\n>One of the most valuable things about the experience on the West coast of the USA was that it exposed him to a much more diverse working environment than what he had been used to in Germany, he says.\n\n>Bussmann said: \xe2\x80\x9cThat was not something I was used to in a European environment and to understand and manage that diversity from a gender and nationality point of view was an invaluable experience.

The bitcoin side of the transaction is nearly frictionless. However once someone buys bitcoins from this machine someone will have to collect the corresponding cash and put it into the bank. From there it will have to be transferred to the exchange of your choice. This transfer can take anywhere from 3-10 days, depending on your location, choice of exchange and luck.   \nThis means you may need as much as 10x your daily transaction volume in a float just to account for fiat processing times, this is something many people underestimate when purchasing an ATM.   \n  \nAnother reason why this machine could be dry is that the Lamassu backend only supports auto purchasing on a few exchanges. I'm sure this will get better as time goes by.  \n  \nIt's also possible that the operator has chosen to limit the maximum total BTC available to the machine as a security measure and just hasn't topped this up yet.\n  \nJust to be clear, I don't operate this particular ATM.

The difficulty of the PoW should be a parameter. When a PoW is found, the miner can be rewarded by converting some sidechain-coin back to bitcoin, so the miner gets rewarded in bitcoin.\n\nTechnically, I imagine adding a special sidechain-to-bitcoin transaction in both the sidechain and the Bitcoin blockchain that holds all the rewards of solving a sidechain block. This special transaction that rewards a miner for finding a sidechain PoW would be present in both the Bitcoin blockchain and the sidechain blockchain, linking and securing both chains.\n\nA sidechain may create blocks at a faster pace than Bitcoin because the difficulty is a parameter and can be set lower. A sidecoin-to-bitcoin reward transaction should be inserted to the Bitcoin blockchain for each sidechain PoW.\n\nSo if a miner finds the solution to a sidechain block, it is announced to the sidechain network, and the sidechain network adds a miner rewarding transaction into the Bitcoin blockchain. This Bitcoin transaction can hold the hash of the solved sidechain block, linking both chains.\n\n**Consequences**\n\n- A rollback of the Bitcoin blockchain would also rollback all sidechain transactions made in the time period that is being rolled back. A rolback should be a rare event but if it happens it would also affect all linked sidechains.\n\n- Each solved sidechain block is subject to a Bitcoin transaction fee, as a transaction is included for each solved sidechain block. Sort of like a Bitcoin tax. But it would be very  tiny since the fee can be divided over all transactions in the sidechain block.\n\n- Settlement of sidechain transaction fees uses the Bitcoin blockchain, whereas settlement of a sidechain transaction ofcourse uses the sidechains own blockchain.': 1, 'add the gpg key to it ...

Possibly, but the overhead is far greater than with Bitcoin. For one, how can I reconcile systems that use competing payment methods? Why would I standardize all of my systems to use, say PayPal or Visa? What happens when the service we need to talk to, talks only Amazon?

It is only when the banks take your money you suddenly realise what is going on just ask many of the citizens in Greece': 1, "Without context, I can't judge what they meant by saying that. I can already say however that this issue must be looked at from several angles.\n\nOne is the human angle. Whenever you have a process where humans are involved, costs increase. Humans need to eat, pay rent. So whenever you can replace humans with software or hardware, you can lower the cost dramatically. Software/hardware doesn't need to eat or pay rent. Has no desires. So eliminating as many humans as possible out of the equation lowers costs dramatically. Bitcoin eliminates many humans out of the equation and has the possibility to eliminate even more middlemen in the future. Many tasks formerly done by humans are now done through bitcoin.\n\nThen there's the centralization/decentralization aspect. A centralized design can perform the same task as the decentralized system with less resources. But as we know, centralized systems have a lot of disadvantages. To alleviate those disadvantages, we are willing to spend more on resources. But this in turn increases the cost. I think this is what Peter Todd has been alluding to. But this point must be seen in a wider context before it can be determined that this will increase transaction fees specifically.\n\nThen there's the competition aspect. The more competition there is, the lower the cost for the consumer. The system has been setup in a way where miners compete with each other. The miner is the human element in the system and the competition ensures that this human element is somewhat contained. Competition ensures that prices don't spiral out of control.\n\nThen there's the revenue aspect. What is important to realize is that it doesn't matter if a system is more expensive. What matters is the cost to the CONSUMER. A system might be more expensive as a whole, but can be setup in a manner where the cost to the consumer is minimal at best. As long as the miner has enough revenue, he can keep the costs low to the consumer. In the current situation, transaction fees are subsidized by the bitcoin adopter. People buy bitcoin from the miner and this revenue allows the bitcoin miner to charge minimal prices for transaction fees. In the future, miners will only have transaction fees as revenue (mining reward will be 0). Transaction fees can remain low in a zero mining reward scenario as long as total number of transactions grows. \n\nI already spoke about the revenue aspect, but revenue size is affected by the numbers of transaction (which I already spoke of) and the bitcoin price. The price of bitcoin is subjectively determined. If bitcoin prices remain low, it will never be able to scale. Higher transaction fees in order to obtain more revenue is not an option, because  otherwhise bitcoin would not be able to compete with Visa and Mastercard.\n\nThen there's the electricity cost aspect as well. This needs to stay managable or these costs might absorb all of the revenue as well.\n\n**TLDR:**\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nAs a whole, decentralized systems have higher infrastructure costs. The costs that come on top of those infrastructure costs (the cost to operate the system) are kept to a minimum by having software/hardware handle as much of the tasks as possible. Competition further limits the cost increase of the remaining human element in the system. Some of the cost of the infrastructure is spread among multiple parties, which also lowers the burden on the operators. The system remains sustainable  if costs remain managable (investment costs + electricity costs) and revenue remains high (number of transactions x bitcoin price). This allows transaction fees to remain low.": 3, "You have a point, but I think the general consensus is that the two authors likely know less about the topic than they let on.

In the 1980s it was C++, 1990s and 2000s it's Javascript and Python, now maybe blockchains are the next big step.\n\nSo, you can actually get quite far with micropayments on top of Bitcoin if you use a Ripple-style network of micropayment channels and use the blockchain only for eventual settlement. In fact, from a cryptoeconomic standpoint, I have a conjecture that you can securely come arbitrarily close to the holy grail of one node processing every transaction for any decentralized application given the proper set of challenge-response protocols and sufficiently high security deposits from all parties.": 1, 'Speak for yourself': 1, 'Let me start by saying that I have tremendous respect for both Peter Todd and Amir Taaki.  Stealth addresses and the implementation of dark wallet may have unfortunate names, but I am pretty darn sure that stealth addresses are going to be used as a way to separate and provide transaction privacy for users some day and hopefully without changing the implementation in the process.  Bitcoin desperately needs a level of privacy between the receiving address and every other transaction a user has performed.  That\'s what they have invented and implemented, essentially.\n\nAll that said, Peter and Amir don\'t know what they are talking about.  They don\'t understand interchange, what an issuing and acquiring bank represent, what card processors are, or what the payment networks in the middle do.  They sure as heck don\'t know how settlement works for card transactions either, which is a parallel and incredibly expensive process with KYB performed by the networks and banks.\n\nThose systems take 3% out of the system whenever they are used to buy a good or service.  This is a massive amount of money.  A bit of that goes to cover chargebacks, but as we\'ve seen, this can be automated with 2/3 multisig using an arbiter, timelock transactions, and other ways we can program money.\n\nBitcoin is cheaper than card networks.  Those guys probably feel pressured to be "smart" about anything, but if you look at their work experience, I would bet that they couldn\'t define the term "acquiring bank" or know something as basic as how CVV codes are generated, or the layout of a credit card number...\n\nSorry, they are wrong.  Bitcoin is way more efficient than current payment systems.  \n\nOn the surface the sole exception might be federated bank transfer systems like ACH or BACS/Fasterpayments, but these systems are heavily subsidized by banks who are profiting from fractional reserve lending, so it\'s not a true apples to apples comparison.  \n\nSorry guys, you are wrong.

Well let me first say this, bitcoin is a distributed ledger. And while it operates using bitcoins, it can indeed power centralized systems, too. In the same way that the internet is somewhat decentralized (for argument's sake) but can power centralized systems.\n\nMeaning that, you could build changetip on bitcoin. Changetip is centralized, you don't actually use the blockchain to send money, but you can take money in and out of your changetip wallet. This is what makes changetip 100% free, although they charge 1% now as a service fee but it's not an inherent cost. In some years from now charging for a tipping service would be considered as ridiculous as charging for a basic email account. It's all software based, it's all centralized, it's all free, but it's powered by bitcoin.\n\nBut pure bitcoin transactions? Well that depends. Obviously it will be cheaper to send $1 billion over bitcoin than through a creditcard. But it's also apparent that bitcoin will likely not do microtransactions cheaply. (<$1). Again, we're talking about 'pure' blockchain transactions. You can build microtransaction systems on bitcoin, it wouldn't be fully decentralized but there's no need for that for a $2 coffee, the passionate politics we often see on this sub becomes somewhat irrelevant at that scale.\n\nBut transactions beyond $1? Seems quite feasible to me. We've seen loads of back of the envelope math that says it's quite cheap and easy to move thousands or even tens of thousands of transactions per second in the near future. It's software, and our hardware and infrastructure gets faster, cheaper, more global etc. Fact is, a transaction is a few hundred bytes of data. Twitter can do more than 150k tweets per second and tweets are more data than a tx, and get queried by more people than a typical tx.\n\nI mean, let's be frank here: Youtube streams more data in 20 seconds than the entirety of all bitcoin transactions recorded in the full blockchain of the past 5 years. Not to mention Netflix.\n\nThis is actually one of the least of my worries.\n\nLet's not forget, bitcoin is a protocol, it's not a profit making business that's partially in the realm of archaic finance and partly digital. It's digital-native. Of course it's going to have a big cost-edge versus say Paypal that involves humans and profit motives because it's agnostic to profits or companies or archaic systems. It's just a protocol, some notions as to how to transfer information and give that information meaning. You can't get much cheaper than that.\n\nAnd lastly, if bitcoin DOES become more expensive than centralized services, and I don't see it happening anytime soon, that's amazing. Because it won't mean that bitcoin became shit. It means everyone else suddenly dropped their fees, as they had to compete with a permission-less open protocol where anyone anywhere could be their own bank, push-send their own money, create peer-to-peer financial services. If that means everyone else drops their fees to near-zero, or hell, do that and move towards more open standards and more transparency, that's great.

From the sound of it, he seems to be saying that transaction fees are higher than Visa and Mastercard, something we know is not true. However, if you were around the reddit forums around the time that video came out, there was an issue with how people complained about needing to buy bitcoin on exchanges and sell them again. You were hit with a double premium fee by doing that. Those extra fees would especially be large when you were buying and selling bitcoin on exchanges where the market was not liquid. As well as volatility issues when there was a time lag between buying the bitcoin and buying the product. All these issues were probably in Amir's head when he stated that fees were not lower. He wanted to prevent people from dismissing bitcoin, because of those usability issues. But as markets get more liquid, and bitcoin products come out that will reduce the time lag (as well as volatility reducing overtime), all these issues will resolve themselves.\n\nAs for Peter Todd, he's right that decentralized systems are more costly as a whole. But that's not a problem as long as revenue remains high (see my other post in the thread).\n\nOne other thing concerning Peter's motives. His priority is decentralization. And with that decentralization comes extra cost. I believe he would prioritize decentralization above transaction fees, since he sees that as bitcoin's strength. He's deliberately trying to push bitcoin in a more decentralized direction and he knows transaction fees might rise as a result.

You can create a wallet using our service, but the design is such that we never see your private keys in unencrypted form (and in one design we never see them in encrypted form either...).  That means we can\'t steal your money.  It also means we don\'t have to pay for insurance or the extra security, which means we cost less.\n\nThere\'s a lot more, but that\'s the idea.  Our team has done a lot of international products, so we\'re going to take it overseas pretty quickly.  It\'s being funded by the people building it, so we really need support to get this off the ground.  It\'s pretty darn expensive to become a money transmitter in all 50 states, and having some traction with the community will help us with investors who can help us with the crazy upfront costs.\n\nThat\'s what it is, exactly.

Our rates will be extremely competitive, and if you sign up now, we\'ll waive your transaction fees on bitcoin purchases and sales forever.\n\nIt really bothers us that every major service today that lets you buy and sell bitcoin also wants to control your private keys.   It bothers us even more given that these same services have started to freeze assets in the name of "KYC".  Of course that\'s completely ridiculous, as the controls for knowing your customer are supposed to be when you open your account, not as an excuse to keep your money after you\'ve made a deposit.  \n\nWhy should you trust a bitcoin bank that has never had an independent financial audit of both fiat and bitcoin that insures a tiny fraction of total deposits? Especially when so many of them have been hacked?\n\nEqually scary is the alternative, using a service that matches you with a local stranger who hopefully is honest and not a violent criminal.\n\nWell we think that not having a choice sucks, and this is why we are building Novauri.  Our design philosophy is simple: build a bitcoin purchase and sale service that builds on bitcoin\xe2\x80\x99s strengths and keeps users in control of their money.  With Novauri your money is fully controlled by you.  We don\xe2\x80\x99t pool funds or have access to your private keys.  Novauri runs on proven technologies and is designed from the ground up by a team with many decades of experience building high risk financial products.  Security like two-factor authentication and secondary passwords are standard.  \n\nOh, and there\'s another thing.  Because we don\'t pretend to be a bank, we don\xe2\x80\x99t have to pay for the expensive security and insurance required to keep shared deposits safe.  Our average prices will be lower than competitors because we are designed to be safe and don\xe2\x80\x99t act like a bitcoin bank.\n\nWe believe the community wants an alternative that respects you enough to let you control your money.  Please sign up for our beta to prove the demand is there.  Our beta will go live in March or April of 2015.  \n\nPlease show us your support and sign up.

Because physical settlement of trade (which means physical transfer of actual asset (stock) ) must take place within 3 days, after trade is executed.

They get away with money laundering because they own the regulators through regulatory capture. The entire FIAT system is hanging by a thread.  It is a house of cards ready to fall.  They already had bank "bail-ins" in Cyprus where the banks stole 1/3 or people\'s bank accounts.  Soon it is coming to America.\n\nThe IRS are [seizing people\'s bank accounts](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/26/us/law-lets-irs-seize-accounts-on-suspicion-no-crime-required.html?_r=1)  without even convicting you of a crime.  The police are seizing people\'s money in [civil asset forfeiture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kEpZWGgJks) when they didn\'t even commit a crime.  EDIT: With bitcoin they can\'t seize your money.\n\nWhen you have money in a bank account, guess what? Your money is not really there.  Over 90% of it has been lent out using fractional reserve techniques.  All you have is a number on a screen or on a piece of paper.  The money is gone.  When everyone realizes this and wants their money back what are you going to do? Ask the Fed to print more for FDIC out of thin air which devalues everyone\'s dollar holdings? With bitcoin you can be your own bank and hold your own money securely.\n\nBitcoin is a better way for the future.  This corrupt and insane money system with central banks and governments in control is not working.  So we support bitcoin, because we are honorable men and women.  We want to contribute and participate in a safer, fair, honest system like Bitcoin, rather than a corrupt system like FIAT.  Also there are many technological advantages to being able to hold money digitally and send it around the world with a click of a mouse.  Also when Bitcoin does catch on more, the price will continue to rise to the moon because it has to in order to accomodate more users.\n\n\n\n': 7, "> why people should put their money on bitcoin\n\nThey shouldn't.

Since you have already sold yours and looking at the prices you stated (in USD I'm going to assume), it would appear that you held for less than a year, so you saw it as a short-term investment.  For a short-term mindset, Bitcoin probably isn't the best place to put money because of the volatility, unless you are thinking really short-term and want to attempt day trading.  Then Bitcoin could function as a medium for that pretty well.\n\nAs far as a long-term mindset, the jury is still out on whether or not people will benefit from putting their money into Bitcoin this early on.

We the people are the trustees of Bitcoin.  That is why Bitcoin is so revolutionary.  Bitcoin is decentralized.  It takes the power of issuing the money away from the banks and gives it to the people, to whom it properly belongs:\n\n"If the American people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency, first by inflation, then by deflation, the banks and corporations that will grow up around them will deprive the people of all property until their children wake up homeless on the continent their Fathers conquered...I believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies...

You don\'t need permission from anyone to use it to store, send, or receive money.  So if the banks shut down your accounts for your medical cannabis/gun shop/gambling operation?  No problem just accept bitcoin instead and nobody can stop you.

Mark Friedenbach, Gregory Maxwell, Andrew Miller, Andrew Poelstra, Jorge Tim\xc3\xb3n, and Pieter Wuille.\n\n\nIf you\xe2\x80\x99ve followed Bitcoin for any time, you\xe2\x80\x99ll know this is a seriously eminent group of authors\n\nIt describes a way to build \xe2\x80\x9cpegged sidechains\xe2\x80\x9d. Sidechains themselves are not new \xe2\x80\x93 the idea, and how to build them, has been discussed for some time and the key breakthrough was outlined earlier in the year. But this paper gives more detail on the concept and has attracted a lot of comment.\n\nBut what are they? And why should anybody care?\n\n**A mental model for Bitcoin**\nThe key to understanding most innovations in the Bitcoin space is to make sure you have the right mental model for how Bitcoin itself works. It turns out that most people I speak to don\xe2\x80\x99t really understand how it works and, as a result, have a faulty mental model.\n\nTo help with this, I\xe2\x80\x99ll net it down to the basics.\n\nFirst, clear your head of the word ledger. The mind-bending secret of Bitcoin is that there actually isn\xe2\x80\x99t a ledger! The only data structures that matter are transactions and blocks of transactions. And it\xe2\x80\x99s important to get this clear in your head if sidechains are going to make sense.\n\nWhen you \xe2\x80\x9cmove\xe2\x80\x9d Bitcoins, what you\xe2\x80\x99re saying is:\n\nHello everybody\xe2\x80\xa6 I\xe2\x80\x99d like to move these specific Bitcoins, please.\nHere is the proof that I am entitled to move them\nAnd here is how the recipient will, in turn, prove that they are entitled to move them.\n\n\nThere are several important points here:\n\n* Bitcoins are not perfectly fungible\xe2\x80\xa6 when you move (or spend) them, you\xe2\x80\x99re spending some specific bitcoins\n\n* In order to spend them, you have to prove you\xe2\x80\x99re entitled to do so. And you do that by providing the solution to a challenge that was laid down when they were sent to you in the first place. This challenge is usually just: \xe2\x80\x9cprove to the world that you know the public key that corresponds to a particular Bitcoin address and are in possession of the corresponding private key\xe2\x80\x9d. But it can be more sophisticated than that.\n\n* When you send Bitcoins somewhere, you lay down the challenge for the next owner. Usually, you\xe2\x80\x99ll simply specify that they need to know the public and private keypair that correspond to the Bitcoin address the coins were sent to. But it can be more complicated than that. In the general case, you don\xe2\x80\x99t even know who the next owner is\xe2\x80\xa6 it\xe2\x80\x99s just whoever can satisfy the condition.\n\nFine. So the \xe2\x80\x9cgrammar\xe2\x80\x9d of a Bitcoin transaction is clear:   \xe2\x80\x9cHere are the coins I want to move, here\xe2\x80\x99s the proof I\xe2\x80\x99m entitled to and here\xe2\x80\x99s what the recipient must do, in turn, if they want to spend them\xe2\x80\x9d.\n\nThis three-part structure to a Bitcoin transaction works well and it turns out that you can do some really interesting things with it.   For example, you can use the \xe2\x80\x9cnot-entirely fungible\xe2\x80\x9d feature to \xe2\x80\x9ctag\xe2\x80\x9d coins. This is the basis of the \xe2\x80\x9cColored Coins\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cSmart Property\xe2\x80\x9d worlds.\n\nBut there are problems, such as:\n\n**Block interval**\n\n**Transaction Structure**\n\nThe \xe2\x80\x9cthree-part\xe2\x80\x9d transaction structure is very general but it only allows you to transfer ownership of Bitcoins. Some people would like to transmit richer forms of information across these sorts of systems.\n\n**Transaction Transfer Conditions**\n\nI said above that you can build sophisticated rules into Bitcoin transactions to specify how ownership is proved. However, the Bitcoin scripting language is deliberately limited.\n\n**One-size-fits-all security model**\n\nIt doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter if you\xe2\x80\x99re moving $1bn or 0.01c across the Bitcoin network, you get the same security guarantees. And you pay for this in fees and time. What if you were prepared to trade safety for speed?\n\n**One-size fits all doesn\xe2\x80\x99t help if the size doesn\xe2\x80\x99t fit you!**\nNow, making experimental or rapid changes to Bitcoin is very risky and so change happens slowly. So if the one-size-fits-all architecture of Bitcoin doesn\xe2\x80\x99t suit a particular use-case, you have a problem.\nIt creates risk and fragmentation and slows the build-out of products, services and infrastructure.\n\n**Centralised Wallet Providers as a \xe2\x80\x9cpoor-man\xe2\x80\x99s sidechain\xe2\x80\x9d?**\nBut there\xe2\x80\x99s an interesting observation we can make. Think about what happens if you send Bitcoins to a centralized wallet such as circle.com for safekeeping.\n\nYou send your coins to a particular Bitcoin address\nThey appear inside your circle wallet and are out of your control on the blockchain.\nAt some point in the future, you might send your coins back out of your circle wallet to a Bitcoin address you own\nYou now have control of some coins on the Bitcoin blockchain again!\nFrom the perspective of the Bitcoin network, Circle is a black box.   You had some coins\xe2\x80\xa6 you sent them to a specific address\xe2\x80\xa6   some stuff happened that Bitcoin couldn\xe2\x80\x99t see\xe2\x80\xa6. And at some point later, you had control of some coins again.   It\xe2\x80\x99s as if those coins had been moved from Bitcoin to somewhere else and then back again.\n\n**Here\xe2\x80\x99s the Sidechains insight**\nThe key idea behind the sidechains concept is:\n\nWhat if you could send Bitcoins not only to individuals, addresses and centralized services but to other blockchains?\n\nImagine there is a Bitcoin-like system out there that you\xe2\x80\x99d like to use. Perhaps it\xe2\x80\x99s litecoin or ethereum or perhaps it\xe2\x80\x99s something brand new.   Maybe it has a faster block confirmation interval and a richer scripting language. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter.   The point is: you\xe2\x80\x99d like to use it but would rather not have to go through the risk and effort of buying the native tokens for that platform. You have Bitcoins already. Why can\xe2\x80\x99t you use them?\n\n**The sidechains ideas is this:**\n\n* Send your Bitcoins to a specially formed Bitcoin address. The address is specially designed so that the coins will now be out of your control\xe2\x80\xa6 and out of the control of anybody else either. They\xe2\x80\x99re completely immobilized and can only be unlocked if somebody can prove they\xe2\x80\x99re no longer being used elsewhere (I\xe2\x80\x99ll explain what I mean by this in a minute).   In other words, you\xe2\x80\x99ve used the core bitcoin transaction rules I described above to lay down a specific condition that the future owner \xe2\x80\x93 whoever it ends up being \xe2\x80\x93 needs to fulfil in order to take control\n\n* Once this immobilisation transaction is sufficiently confirmed, you send a message to the other blockchain \xe2\x80\x93 the one you were wanting to use. This message contains a proof that the coins were sent to that special address on the Bitcoin network, that they are therefore now immobilized and, crucially, that you were the one who did it\n\n* If the second blockchain has agreed to be a Bitcoin sidechain, it now does something really special\xe2\x80\xa6 it creates the exact same number of tokens on its own network and gives you control of them.\n\n* So it\xe2\x80\x99s as if your Bitcoins have been transferred to this second chain. And remember: they\xe2\x80\x99re immobilized on the Bitcoin network\xe2\x80\xa6 so we haven\xe2\x80\x99t created or destroyed any\xe2\x80\xa6. Just \xe2\x80\x9cmoved\xe2\x80\x9d them.\n\n* You can now transact with those coins on that second chain, under whatever rules that chain chooses to implement.\n\n* Perhaps blocks are created faster on that sidechain. Perhaps transaction scripts are \xe2\x80\x9cturing complete\xe2\x80\x9d. Perhaps you have to pay fees to incent those securing that sidechain. Who knows. The rules can be whatever those running that sidechain want them to be. The only rule that matters is that the sidechain agrees to follow the convention that if you can prove you put some Bitcoins out of reach on the Bitcoin network, the same number will pop into existence on the sidechain.\n\n* And now for the second clever part.
