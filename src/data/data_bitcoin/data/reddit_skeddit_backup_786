This property makes it astronomically difficult to create two different chunks of data that gives the same hash.\n\nBitcoin uses the tried and tested function called [SHA-256](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2) to convert blocks of transaction data into numbers (block hash). Miners\' job is finding a block hash lower than the network-wide target. To do this, they continuously hash the block while modifying the data slightly (by incrementing an otherwise useless number within the block header).\n\nWhen a suitable block hash is found (and accepted by the network), two things are certain. First, because of the mentioned property of hash functions, the block hash indisputably identifies the transaction data it is created from. Second, since the probability of finding the number is known, the amount of network-wide computational work put into discovering it can be assumed to converge to the predetermined average.\n\nThe idea is, having blocks include a mathematically provable amount of work on them. Since every block references the one before it in its own data structure, transactions that get included in a block become more secure as new blocks are discovered. This way, an attacker that wants to change the history of transactions needs to do at least as much computational work as the blocks carry in total.\n\nObviously, being "Satoshi" gives no advantage to you whatsoever.

Really, it's all about context. If someone is interested in bitcoin and you tip them  100 bits, that small amount is all that's really needed for them to get their feet wet.\n\nIn comparison, if I tip somone 100 bits for a helpful answer, that might be nice if they have a changetip account setup already, but otherwise, you're asking them to take a few steps in order for them to claim their reward of a few pennies that they wont even be able to spend unless they already had some bitcoin somewhere. While the gesture is certainly of good nature, some may consider it petty, and at times can come across as more of an advertisement for bitcoin instead of the intended friendly gesture.\n\nFor this reason, I try to tip meaningful amounts, at least 1 USD. It's also helpful to attach the value to something physical. So if someone really helps me out, I can buy them a beer for example, which I feel translates well to real life.

However, I feel like that sentiment sets up people to be disappointed when btc/usd value doesn\'t skyrocket when they expect it to. I think tipping should convey one users appreciation of another users contribution, instead of something like "hey, this isn\'t worth much now, but just wait!" type of attitude. Bitcoin is immediately useful, no need to wait for it to increase in value. If I tip a user $3.50 for a beer, I want them to get a cold ass beer and enjoy it, not wait a couple years to see if they can maybe get 10 beers instead. That\'s part of the reason why I recommend tipping in amounts tied to real-world things, like a beer or a coffee for instance.\n\nAs a side note, I think (and very often observe) that people get too wrapped up in bitcoin as a value-gaining investment. While the USD/BTC exchange rate may increase over time, I believe that the utility and autonomy brought about by bitcoin and blockchain technology should championed over the potential increase of one\'s net worth. A great way for users to experience that is through tipping, and in turn, using the funds they\'ve received as tips to buy something from the growing bitcoin economy. This is facilitated by tipping in usable amounts, using real-world items to judge actual value.\n': 2, "No, it's the poorly designed bitcoin that has resulted in this.

It would be great for people invested to not have to go home to their families and discuss the 70% drop in price since last year. But here's the rub... this tiny subreddit simply isn't capable of increasing the market cap by $8 billion dollars over night.\n\nPrice is fairly important, but we need more people using the stuff.": 3, "There's a time and a place for small tips, like in giveaway threads or experiments. We shouldn't base our tips on what they *might* be worth in the future. We are all accustomed to microtransactions by now, but the fact of the matter is that most people aren't. When they hear 'tip', they think about how they tipped $5-10 for their last dinner. They're not going to see the value in tiny tips yet, and time after time it's viewed as worthless spam. \n\nI would exercise caution about unleashing a 'tip bomb' on some unsuspecting YouTuber at this stage, because we don't know how it would be perceived. It would be wise to test the waters first to find people who *actually accept* bitcoin tips, then consider a tip bomb just for them.\n\nIf you want to make an impression, you need to put your money where your mouth is. \n\n$1 /u/changetip private": 2, "> You would turn down 50,000 5 cent tips?\n\nThat is a total strawman, because today people are lucky to receive *one* tip, let alone two.\n\nOnce someone is setup with a changetip account, tip as low as you want. At that point it's all automatic and they don't have to do anything to claim it, so they will appreciate the gesture. If they have to create an account, however, it's not gonna happen if you don't tip well.\n\nIt would literally* cost me more money to create a changetip account than I would make by claiming a few cents. A dollar is at least worth looking into.\n\n*Admittedly, I'm lucky enough to be able to monetize the extra hours in my day, but I think you get the point.": 2, "That would never work.\n\nYou're basically asking someone to give up a competitive edge. And really, it points to a basic, inherent flaw in bitcoin; the more people adopt it, the harder it gets. Generally, when a product is mined (like say, gold, silver, and so forth) it becomes easier to mine because new tools are developed, better understanding is developed, and so on. The difficulty has never increased, only the number of people trying to harness it.\n\nWith bitcoin, in order to avoid a 51%+ attack, you need to scale the entire system into an absurd number game. It's like playing 3rd edition D&D at 150th level--the numbers are too high and too stupid to  do anything and anyone new trying to get in at 1st is just fucked.": 2, 'Agree with OP by a country mile....here here with 1 beer /u/changetip': 1, "The issue is the first tip to a new user of Bitcoin generally, and changetip in particular. Giving them their first bit of cryptocurrency in an amount like 100 bits gives them a negative experience - they can't withdraw it, the fees are too high (details depending on exact amount).\n": 1, 'http://i1.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/506/267/cb0.jpg': 1, "> I agree it would be better if someone developed an algo where crypto supply is based on market needs instead of a linear constant expansion.\n\nYou're essentially hoping for traditional government issued currency at this point, where supply is increased and decreased based on the market's behavior. ": 3, 'Oh.... boy.... Okay what you just advocated was a classic pump and dump or a perfect explanation of the greater fool theory. Essentially this sub would be buying all the coins the miners are using. Therefore keeping the price higher than it would have been, in order to attract more people, in an effort to conceal the risks, so that you can then sell the coins you purchased at a profit. \n\nWhy not just have miners stop mining if its not profitable, or why not have miners just hold coins instead of immediately dumping them. Could it be that miners realize how easy it is to make money and the ones protecting bitcoin the most, are the least likely to give a shit about it? ': 4, 'I agree OP\n\n700 bits /u/changetip': 1}}}
