': 1, 'Thanks!': 1, 'ASIC stands for Application-Specific Integrated Circuit. It\'s a chip like those found anywhere else, specifically made to mine cryptocurrency as efficiently as possible. There are SHA ASICs (for Bitcoin and early altcoins), and Scrypt ASICs (for newer altcoins like Litecoin and Dogecoin). An SHA ASIC is much more efficient than a graphics card, to the point where graphics card mining is utterly useless for any SHA-based cryptocurrency. Scrypt ASICs are a bit more efficient than graphics cards but in a rare situation you may still be able to profit from mining with a graphics card that you already have anyway (free power, high-end ATI card)\n\nMost ASICs are devices that can be hooked up either via USB to a computer or via a network cable to your network. Either way, you\'ll need some software to set everything up but that\'s not too hard to learn.\n\nYou can use http://www.coinwarz.com/cryptocurrency to get an idea of profitability of any ASIC you see.\n\n\nAs an example, http://www.ebay.com/itm/KNC-Neptune-3-400-Gigahash-Rig-Miner-In-stock-Ready-to-ship-/321608555552?pt=US_Virtual_Currency&hash=item4ae15d1c20 does 3400 GH/s and would earn you about $15.38 per day mining Peercoin, an SHA-based altcoin.\n\nOf that money, $4.56 would be used to pay for the 1900 watts it uses, if you pay $0.10 per kwh. You\'d keep $10.82. But the difficulty will likely rise, so don\'t expect total profits to exceed more than 2-4 months\' worth of mining unless you have free power. (That said, only 1/3rd of its earnings go back to power costs.. if Bitcoin\'s difficulty rises as slowly as it has since july, you could get 3 months\' worth of profit out of it rather than 2-4)\n\nThat would be about $650-$1300, less than the machine is priced at. You can imagine why it hasn\'t been sold yet. Doing the math results in this guideline: don\'t pay more than $180 per 1000 GH/s (or $1 per 5.5 GH/s), and don\'t buy anything that uses more than 625 watts per 1000 GH/s.\n\n\nOf course, this assumes the machine works perfectly and you can get it working at maximum speed. This requires skills and/or luck. Most of the above numbers assume some safety margins so you can get some profit out rather than only breaking even after a lot of effort.\n\n\nAny brand-new ASICs will likely be used ("tested") at the manufacturer\'s place for a while until it\'s no longer going to earn back its costs in its lifetime at the original price, so second-hand is your best bet. And any second-hand offering is similarly going to cost more than it\'ll earn unless you find a great deal. This is why people say that Bitcoin mining is futile: unless you manufacture the ASICs, you\'re not going to profit.': 1, 'http://i.imgur.com/ci1As0T.jpg': 1, "You can mine for fun but don't expect to earn anything substantial. /r/bitcoinmining": 2, 'Yes to both question.

Don't do this until you research it bit and understand the assumptions you are making about future price and difficulty.  The calculator at bitcoinwisdom.com might be useful.  At today's price and difficulty, an S1 would get you about $5 a week.  Of course the difficulty may rise or fall, and price of BTC may rise or fall, so their are no guarantees.
