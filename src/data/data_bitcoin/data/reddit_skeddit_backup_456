In a heat engine, heat flows from a high temperature to a low temperature, and in the process, some of the energy is used to do work. This is how steam turbines work, or gasoline engines. Thermoelectric generators are also basically heat engines.\n\nIn a heat engine, the amount of work you can extract from a given heat flow is limited by the temperatures used. The theoretical limit for efficiency for a heat engine (the Carnot efficiency) is equal to (1 - T_L / T_H), where T_L and T_H are the cold and hot temperatures in Kelvin.\n\nFor a silicon chip, you might have silicon die temperatures of up to 125\xc2\xb0C. The chip package would have a lower temperature, probably no greater than 100\xc2\xb0C. If the cold temperature were 25\xc2\xb0C, that would mean your efficiency limit would be (1 - 298K/373K) = 20%. Current typical thermoelectric generators are actually only a fraction of that, with 5-8% being common (though probably for higher temperatures). Of course, this power wouldn't be at a usable voltage, so you'd have to add at least one DC2DC converter stage (typical efficiency: 80%) before using the power. This means that adding a thermoelectric generator to a device would be able to save 4% to 7% of your electricity bill at best. \n\nThermoelectric generators are bulky and expensive.

I might just take you up on that.  There have been times that I\'ve wished I had a platform to make a point about bitcoin, knowing full well that /r/bitcoin isn\'t open-minded enough to give me the time of day.  I have my doubts about whether a voice like mine would get anything but hate even on a more "tolerant" bitcoin blog like yours (not because of you of course) but I definitely do have thoughts & opinions that I feel very strongly about;  I\'m not a great writer but I can probably formulate an idea well enough... maybe I\'ll give it a shot. \n\nThanks again for the invitation. :)': 0, 'I am not a programmer, so my details can easily be wrong... \n\nBut my understanding of the blockchain is that bunches of transactions bundled together into "blocks", whereby the entire bundle is then run through a hash function. (With Bitcoin, there is an additional noonce added, which helps the system dictate difficulty.)\n\nThe next block contains that the output of that hash, along with its own set of blocks, and is then itself run through the hash function as well.\n\nThat way, each block validates the ones before it - if you build 30 blocks that way, and then attempt to swap out any one of them, the chain will no longer validate because the the output hash of the block that was swapped out won\'t match when a new block is substituted for it.\n\nBitcoin needs to concern itself with things like 51% attacks because it\'s run on an open network that anyone can join. And being that its a transactional system, it needs a way to introduce coins into its ecosystem, and the most logical way for that to happen is as a reward for mining.\n\nTo overly simplify, a system for tracking share ownerships could be world readable, but only writable by NASDAQ\'s systems, it doesn\'t need to concern itself with 51% attacks, it doesn\'t need escallating difficulties, and doesn\'t even need block awards.\n\nNasdaq could just publish its blockchain, and publish the public part of the key it uses to sign blocks so that people can validate that they are indeed looking at Nasdaq\'s chain, and further, once they have downloaded a copy of their own, can tell if it\'s been tampered with.\n\nThat\'s my idea, anyways....\n\nI just think that a Blockchain for tracking share ownership of a small group of companies (70 or so), whose shares trade rarely, could be useful. But there are some parts of Bitcoin that wouldn\'t necessarily be needed (35 GB of legacy non-related transactions, escalating difficulty, miners rewards, etc). The previous transactions are obviously needed by Bitcoin, and like i said, difficulty, block awards, etc, are add-ons to the basic blockchain idea for creating a limited number of digital tokens at a predictable rate without regard for how many or how few computers are on the network...\n\nIf any of that makes sense...
