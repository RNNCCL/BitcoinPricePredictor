How many of these prestigious publications are actually replicable?  We cannot risk to lose the integrity of the scientific process by gaming the system.  \n\nI imagine that the community would not be bootstrapped by scientists - at least the ones we refer to as the PI.  Instead, it would be bootstrapped by graduate students, post doctoral researchers, technicians, medical students, etc, who are knowledgeable but also eager to spread information that they know and learn more.  The guys over at /r/science already make posts without an incentive, but I argue that an increasing amount of these types of people would go to make posts if there was a monetary incentive (even if small) to do so.  \n\nThe real scientists we refer to as PI's would come into the discussion later.  If you know anything about scientists, you know that they love to talk about their work.  You also know that they will defend their work to no end if it is challenged.  I think they would join in on discussions if the people are there to discuss with.  \n\n>The real problem has nothing to do with direct monetary compensation for writing reviews. The real problem is how to make it prestigious to do so.\n\nThis is an interesting point and was just an idea.  I don't think it is necessary to directly monetize the review process.

Here's a few.\n\n* **Known quantity**: The total number of bitcoins that can be mined has been preset at 21 million, whereas the amount of gold that can be mined is a more complicated question.\xc2\xa0\n\n* **Paper wallets:**  Bitcoin is a better alternative than gold because owning real, physical gold is expensive to store and transport, while spending and storing bitcoin is effectively costless.\n\n* **Divisibility:**  They can be divided down to fractions such as one hundred millionth of a bitcoin.  The smallest useful unit of gold is a gram for around $45-60 dollars. You can\xe2\x80\x99t make gold change for less than that.\xc2\xa0": 2, "I think there is a plethora of features that make bitcoin superior to gold. Let's name a bunch here...\n\nHere is a summary (the first four are from Taariq Lewis' article)\n\n* **Trivial to validate authenticity:** How do you know your investment gold is authentic? Most of us can inspect our gold with our eyes with small purchases and have a degree of faith the package was not tampered from refinery to gold dealer. However, at large scales, its very hard for gold investors to verify the authenticity of all their gold. Stored gold is always at risk and the authenticity checks are either hard or costly. Bitcoin\xe2\x80\x99s authenticity is easily verified as bitcoin technology has built in authentication and verification. It\xe2\x80\x99s impossible to forge or counterfeit a bitcoin.\n* **Faster transportation and transmission:** As a gold dealer, we\xe2\x80\x99ve found it very expensive to deliver gold and silver globally. In one case study, we were asked to deliver 400 ounces of customer silver and gold from the United States to Singapore. However, transmitting 2,133 bitcoins ((400 Ounces * $1,200) / $225 per BTC)) from San Francisco to Singapore to purchase gold took only 10 minutes. We think not many sophisticated gold investors are aware of this feature of bitcoin relative to gold.\n* **More control of storage at large amounts:** As a gold dealer, we deal with large holdings of gold and silver. Storage of these holdings become increasingly difficult and costly at larger values as they require more resources to secure and manage. Interestingly, at larger amounts, bitcoin software requires the same security as at smaller amounts.\n* **Investment security requiring less intermediaries:** Physical gold and silver in sizeable holdings require more individuals and organizations to deliver security and storage. Although these costs are quite low after years of specialization, bitcoin provides asset security with less need for intermediaries.\n\n* **Known quantity:** The total number of bitcoins that can be mined has been preset at 21 million, whereas the amount of gold that can be mined is a more complicated question. \n* **Paper wallets:** Bitcoin is a better alternative than gold because owning real, physical gold is expensive to store and transport, while spending and storing bitcoin is effectively costless.\n* **Divisibility:** They can be divided down to fractions such as one hundred millionth of a bitcoin. The smallest useful unit of gold is a gram for around $45-60 dollars. You can\xe2\x80\x99t make gold change for less than that. If a Satoshi were worth a penny, a bitcoin would be worth $1 million, and the bitcoin ecosystem would be worth $14 trillion.\n* **M of N Storage:** Protects against multiple threats without increasing risk of loss.\n* **Never Been Counterfeitted:** And probably never will be.\n* **Weightless:** A Satoshi weighs 0 grams; bitcoin worth $1 million weighs 0 grams.\n* **Intrinsically Supports Contracts I:** Ownership can be programmatically and conditionally transferred.\n* **Intrinsically Supports Contracts II:** Authority to spend can be distributed among multiple co-owners, in a variety of ways.": 5, 'Thank you to Reddit community for giving us more thoughts an ideas to target other hard asset groups.

So there\'s no significant relationship between the number of transactions in the block and the amount of work required to test a hash.

The system was developed in partnership with Xapo, a Palo Alto, Calif.-based bitcoin wallet and custodial service provider.\n\nTaringa! c0-founder Hern\xc3\xa1n Botbol said his firm had been wanting to introduce a revenue-sharing model to add to an existing, non-financial incentive system that encourages popular content and helped his firm achieve rapid network growth.

They will have the capacity to send tips to one and another and Taringa! itself will facilitate purchases of consumer goods \xe2\x80\x93 starting with digitally delivered virtual products such as games, said Mr. Botbol.\n\nOn Friday, Mr. Botbol outlined the project to a small luncheon gathering of venture capitalists and bitcoin businessmen at venture firm Andreessen Horowitz in Menlo Park, Calif.  There, it prompted discussion about how such projects might expand the transactional use of bitcoin, which after rapid growth among a mostly tech-savvy core of early adopters has struggled to make a sizable dent in developed-country payment markets, where bank-issued credit and debit cards dominate. Bitcoin enthusiasts\xe2\x80\x99 hope is that projects such as the Taringa!-Xapo partnership \xe2\x80\x93 which focus on ways bitcoin can be used where the traditional financial system is unable to deliver \xe2\x80\x93 could be an impetus for wider adoption in the developing world, where many believe digital currencies have their best chance of success.\n\nThe deal is part of a new emerging-markets-focused strategy for Xapo, which has become the biggest custodian of digital currencies in the world, mostly by developed economy-based long-term investors in bitcoin. In an interview, Xapo CEO Wences Casares said he sees fresh opportunities in the developing world, \xe2\x80\x9cwhere people are using bitcoin not as a store of value or an investment but as a way to spend on online.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBitcoin can challenge the traditional financial model in many such places, Mr. Wences said, because that bank-centric system has failed to facilitate e-commerce, even though it\xe2\x80\x99s something that people clearly want.\n\nIn Latin America, where well-functioning web sites of the U.S. are visible but inaccessible, \xe2\x80\x9cpeople can see that you can you transact, but they cannot actually transact,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Casares. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a little obscene; it\xe2\x80\x99s like they\xe2\x80\x99re teasing you.\xe2\x80\x9d': 22, 'Taringa is not Facebook rival at alll.\n\nTaringa is just a forum to publish tutorials, download links.. and not too much more.

I wanted to go ahead and address some of the meaningful concerns  that have been raised about our service.  We have built this service in order to address the needs of the community, and we are eager to find ways to enhance our service based on community feedback.\n\nWE ARE OPEN SOURCE AND NON EXCLUSIVE\n\nFirst, let me start by saying that the Wallet Name Service is in no way exclusive to Netki, and that anyone who follows the formats published on our developer and github pages, can register and serve Wallet Names themselves from their Internet connection at home. Our developer site is here and contains a link to our github:  https://www.netki.com/#/developers\n\nNOTE: I just double checked and realized we haven\xe2\x80\x99t published the formats yet.  Our oversight, they will go up by tomorrow morning. In the meantime, if you really wanted to you could decipher the record formats from the API server source code, it is pretty straight forward. :)\n\nAll that our lookup API server does is lookup records from the blockchain and the Internet and parse the results in order to allow developers to hit a simple REST API, rather than do the work themselves.  We have open sourced this API server on our GitHub, so you can verify this yourself as well as run your own version of the API server 100% independently. Alternatively, you could skip the API entirely and do all of the lookups and parsing yourself.  \n\n\n\nWE ARE DECENTRALIZED AND DISTRIBUTED\n\nOur service is both decentralized and distributed.  We register the base name, such as \xe2\x80\x9cjustinwnewton.bit\xe2\x80\x9d on the Namecoin blockchain, in order to provide full ownership and censor proof control.  In the record on the blockchain we store the base name,  the name servers used, and the DNSSEC public key.  We then keep the Wallet Name to bitcoin address mapping on distributed DNS servers.  This means your full wallet name remains private, unless you share it with someone, and means you can share your name with whoever you choose without having to publish your name and bitcoin address to everyone on a permanent public ledger.  This helps to maintain user privacy while still making things easier to use.  In addition to blockchain based names, we also support traditional ICANN domain names for partners and brands.\n\nLike the lookup API, we wanted to make using the service available to everyone.  Users can choose from the easiest and free path, having a name auto-registered via one of our partners (Example: \xe2\x80\x9cjustin.holytransaction.com\xe2\x80\x9d coming soon) where the name to address mapping are automatically configured and the user only needs to share their wallet name to start using it.    Users can also run their own independent DNS servers and register on the blockchain themselves for 100% control. For those  who want a vanity name, but don\xe2\x80\x99t want to do a lot of work, they can register a name through us and manage it via our web interface (Example: \xe2\x80\x9cbatwallet.brucewayne.bit\xe2\x80\x9d).   \n\nIt was important to us when we designed this service to ensure that we met the overlapping goals of protecting user privacy, creating a solution that was resistant to censorship, and making bitcoin easy to use. We also wanted users to be able to choose their own path, be 100% independent or have a zero click experience in getting set up through our partners. Either way , we provide the ability to do so.\n\nWE SUPPORT UNIQUE ADDRESSES PER LOOKUP\nOur service supports both HD Wallets (BIP 0032) and Payment Requests (BIP 0070).  In these cases the DNS record will contain a URL and a second lookup will be done by the API server and parsed to be returned via the API.  A brief video here:  https://youtu.be/gunA1zBnEcs shows how this works.  \n\nUnfortunately, today, none of our initial partners are supporting this, and there isn\xe2\x80\x99t an easy way for an individual to do this themselves.   We thought it was important as well, so to that end we are currently working on another open source project that will make it easy for any wallet or individual to run their own server to generate a unique address per lookup in order to prevent address re-use.  We have started talking to our partners about features that would be desired in this project, and we will be opening it up more broadly when we announce and do the first release in the next few weeks.\n\nThanks for listening, and I hope this clears things up!\n': 15, "Adam,\n   As we have said a few times today, it is key for us to ensure we do things the right way for the community and the future.

There are a couple of use cases here, let me answer for each of them.\n\nCase 1: A user only has a static wallet address, and uses the Wallet Name "SendMeLotsOfMoney.rightnow.bit" to point to it.  rightnow.bit is registered in the blockchain, but for someone to know your full wallet name to lookup, you would have to share it with them, just like you do with your address today.  This doesn\'t improve privacy over the existing system, but it doesn\'t hurt it either.\n\nCase 2: A user has an HD wallet.  In this case in addition to knowing your Wallet Name, what is contained in the DNS record is not an address but a URL that will allow our open source API server to do a second lookup, parse that and hand back the unique address generated by the wallet provider/payment processor/whatever.  In this case we improve privacy over the existing case because even if you share your Wallet Name with someone once, they should send to a unique address every time, versus the case today where if you share a wallet address with someone once, the easiest thing to do is just keep re-using it.

Techniques like micropayment hubs allow payments to occur off block chain at effectively unlimited volume, with only periodic settlement transactions hitting the chain. With widely deployed micropayment channels there is no reason that 1MB blocks could not serve any reasonable level of global payments, assuming no other competing uses for the block space.\n\nSidechains also provide a releaf valve of sorts, allowing people to opt in or out of larger block chains, with only those using the chain putting their funds at risk.\n\nWithin a single chain there is a very real tradeoff between block size and centralization pressure. Every added megabyte pushes out small scale miners, high latency links, or low bandwidth connections.

Lawsky\nNew York Superintendent of Financial Services Benjamin M. Lawsky said that the final BitLicense would be release by the end of May \xe2\x80\x9cat the latest.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nWhile New York is poised to be the first state regulator to release virtual currency licensing rules, it will not be the last. Lawsky said that the New York Department of Financial Services had been in close contact with other states, including California, that are looking to develop their own licensing regime for virtual currency businesses through its membership on a Conference of State Bank Supervisors panel on the issue and other contacts.\n\nAlthough there is room for other states to have different regulations for virtual currency firms, there is a need for at least some consistency, Lawsky said.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re going to see how this all shakes out. I think there\xe2\x80\x99s room for federalism, but at the same time if you have a whole series of different rules and it becomes a crazy quilt patchwork, that can get hard to comply with,\xe2\x80\x9d Lawsky said on the sidelines of an event hosted by Dow Jones.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll have to see what other states do and other countries do, and if things don\xe2\x80\x99t make sense we will take the next step,\xe2\x80\x9d he added.\n\nThe BitLicense, which Lawsky and the DFS unveiled in July, would for the first time subject Bitcoin businesses to anti-money laundering, consumer protection and cyber security standards that have become commonplace in the more traditional financial services sector.\n\nHowever, Lawsky has repeatedly stated that he does not want the licensing regime to be so stringent as to hamper innovation in the digital currency space.\n\nThe latest version of the New York Department of Financial Services\xe2\x80\x99 BitLicense proposal, released in February in response to around 7,000 comments on the original proposal, includes a two-year conditional BitLicense for small startup firms that want to operate Bitcoin businesses in New York.\n\nThe two-year transitional BitLicense will be available to startups and small businesses that are unable to meet the high regulatory bar set by the DFS.\n\nThe BitLicense proposal also includes a requirement that firms report suspicious transactions to the DFS. Typically such reporting is done to the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, a unit of the U.S. Department of the Treasury.\n\nAdvocates for virtual currencies have bristled at the state-level AML reporting requirement, however.\n\nThere have also been calls for additional safe harbors to be included in the rule.\n\nNew York\xe2\x80\x99s BitLicense revised proposal did make some changes that were welcomed by the virtual currency world.\n\nAs an example, the proposal eliminates previous language requiring any firm operating with a BitLicense to obtain the addresses and transaction data for all parties to a virtual currency transaction.\n\nInstead, firms will only have to get that information for their own customers and, where they can, the counterparties to a transaction.\n\nTechnology firms and other companies that are using virtual currencies for nonfinancial purposes, including the miners that use high-powered computers to mine for Bitcoin, will also not have to register for a BitLicense under the revised proposal.\n\n--Editing by Rebecca Flanagan.': 6, 'Why can\'t the federal government offer grant money to States contingent on their participation in a national regulatory framework that is consistent?  \n\nIt\'s in everyones\' best interest to have a single set of rules with which to comply, including consumer protection.  \n\nThis increases efficiency, lowers the cost of compliance, makes it easier to innovate, lowers costs to consumers, and helps everyone, including the States who need the tax revenue from the successful businesses that are now able to exist and grow.\n\nIt also means that there is only one set of rules that can change over time, and the amount of thought and planning that can go into changes will be much more focused.\n\nLawsky seems like a political guy.  Take the BitLicense to the feds, lobby to modernize the BSA and include components of the bitlicense, and then nationalize it through creation of the "Financial Modernization Act" with the associated "Financial Modernization Grant Program" where you offer each State a tidy sum in annual grant money if they replace their State regulation affecting MSB\'s, virtual currency exchangers/administrators with the rules in the Financial Modernization Act.': 3, "Yeah agreed.

There are many reports (from the \'real\' world) where people (naive or reckless people) went bankrupt because they opened highly leveraged positions and ended up with huge debt towards their brokers when shit went against their position. Forced liquidation also puts a cap on any debt occurring towards the exchange. Debt is deadly in the bitcoin world.\n\n> So long as I keep stumping up the cash, they are happy.

Do understand that the volatilty comes from the fact that bitcoin as a currency market is exceptionally illiquid. Any time someone makes a large move into or out of bitcoin, the price moves all over the place. So we have this effect where people with relatively small amounts of money (small in the global market sense) can make appreciable impacts on the price.\n\nAlso, there isn\'t anything wrong with people speculating on bitcoin as a means of making a profit.

It will take a few key domino's but once it happens, look out below.": 3, 'Central banks and finance companies are just going to be very wary about bitcoin because it\'s completely foreign to their mindset. They are very used to having relatively closed (but audited) books, they don\'t know what they don\'t know, the winners in the current game don\'t want a new thing to change the ground rules underneath them, and the current system gives them a lot of power.\n\nCryptocurrencies I think are here to stay, though they can be disrupted by legal means (make it illegal to own any), and technical means (the Great Firewall), and social means - changing the discourse about them to something else. \n\nDifferent question as to whether or not bitcoin alone, a replacement of bitcoin, or a family or constellation of altcoins, other cryptocurrencies based on other ideas, or a yucky closed group Ripple thing wins twenty years out... \n\nThe invisible hand of the market is pretty likely to make the businesses a lot more efficient, and getting big profits off of remittances and simple money transfers, if it was ever profitable really, that\'s going to slip. The money they can make with true fractional reserve lending, and the power that gives them to reward friends (Cantillon effect) and spend money before the rest of the economy has seen it, they don\'t want to give up that power. They don\'t want their job to become an algorithm.\n\nBut, bitcoin or not, disruption is coming to finance. To some degree, they are ready. They hire a lot of smart people, "quants" etc, making money on lending, trading, risk management, etc. \n\nCan we change the culture where they take the risks and get the gains, but then when it implodes, they walk away and leave the taxpayer with the burden? Sometimes the "taxpayers" are also gaining - as some of them do well when they have a job, a working economy, some ownership of these public companies in their 401k etc. I have a lot of problems with them privatizing the gains and socializing the losses.\n\nI think bitcoin has a good chance of becoming another odd currency in the great scheme of the currency crosses that are out there. Right now, whether they know it or not, if they take any currency at all, most people want mainly one of the major currencies for their goods and services, and would consider an alternate if they got a good rate of compensation for it (say 5%). So say I\'d take dollars and bitcoin equally, but I\'d have to be paid a little bit more in euros before (for me) it\'d be a coin toss which one to take. But if you want to pay me in Iraqi Dinars - there\'s no question I\'d rather be paid in bitcoins or dollars. I think that most people are slowly going to have the same realization -- that maybe if their currency servces less than on the order of ~10 million people, there\'s no point, and they might as well take dollars, bitcoins, or something else. I think that this has already happened. I think you could take dollars nearly anywhere and people would take it for payment - maybe it\'s not ideal, but they\'d know it was valuable. And I think that will happen to cryptocurrencies and bitcoin specifically too. People will take bitcoins because it\'s a lot easier than getting set up with credit cards and PayPal and all kinds of junk.\n\nThe inflation rate of bitcoin is going to "improve" (there\'s no right number really), so it offers some incentive to join earlier rather than later, and it\'s very predictable...  It\'s going to be subject to speculative forces, like gold has been, but without having gold\'s history. It\'s astounding and kind of cool that 5000 years across cultures from Ancient Egypt to the modern day, gold has been very valuable. Bitcoin is the ultimate fiat currency - only worth something by fiat - but here the fiat is a group of people that all use it and not a sovereign demanding it as payment for taxes.
