My parents always knew where they would find us when they got home.  At 12, I got an Atari 600XL with cassette drive as my first "real" computer, dabbling in BASIC and assembly but mostly gaming (Miner 2049er FTW!)  Once my brother got his Amiga 500, we were all in.  I bought a Supra 2400 modem and we were all over any BBS we could discover.  I remember listening to MOD files from Moby years before his first record deal.  My Amiga 4000 was the first and only computer I sold for a profit, since Commodore went under and video editors were clamoring for Toaster compatible hardware.  I was using GEnie when I first discovered the internet through a portal they offered.  I was in my 20\'s and too naive to realize the impact it would have on society, and missed riding that wave of opportunity as a result.  I remember talking with the founder of Earthlink when he was just starting out, hearing how he lied to his parents to get a loan.  He told them he was starting a restaurant and said if they knew he intended to start an ISP, they would have disowned him.  Watching my 401k shrink significantly in the tech crash and then again in 2008 spurred me to become an economics geek as well -- just in time to recognize the potential of bitcoin when it came out.  I\'d be damned if I was going to miss another opportunity and got in early.  There\'s no substitute for the experience I gathered in the past few decades.

(and the 5 1/4" 10MB hdd that later became 20MB with a RLL controller).  I ran a BBS and was cosysop on quite a few others. X.25/tymnet and other people\'s vaxen were how I first used the Internet.  I have terminal logs reading about the EFF right when it was founded and used IRC when channels were just numbers (and even without channel names it was still better than twitter is today), had friends arrested in the early enforcement of anti-hacking laws, seems quaint against the world today.

(strangely, I seem to have been half the age of most of the rest of ham radio operators the whole time I\'ve been licensed... :) )\n\nNot so many years later, I was sporting a 1GB drive with the same dimensions as that 10MB one, though it probably cost as much as a used car.  I talked about the ability of technology to transform peoples lives but when it was text and waiting most people couldn\'t see it. Almost overnight it (or at least from here it seems so) was obvious to everyone how important computers (and later, the Internet)-- the technology just had to catch up. I remember when "email viruses" were a hoax, and then it turned that the hoax became reality (thanks Microsoft). I guess that happens pretty often.  I posed on usenet, but always anonymously-- thank god, even I can\'t find the posts now (sorry sci.crypt, I knew not how stupid I was then but I\'m sure you did); I fear for the youth of today and the perpetual memory of the internet. We\'re going to need mandatory name changes when people turn 18. Made my first webpage for NCSA/Mosaic. Crazy slirp hack to get pseudo IP connectivity from a shell account. Gopher was (and is to this day) always faster than the web.  In later years, I helped with the cracking of DVD-CSS so that GNU/Linux users wouldn\'t be denied access to DVDs (and it\'s funny how history is so inaccurate about what really happened, I see that playing out a lot in Bitcoin too... people who do the real work are happy to let idiots take credit, because they also take the liability), but these days no one cares about DVDs-- that was a waste of time. I started editing Wikipedia in 2004, and that wasn\'t a waste of time and I knew it wouldn\'t be.  Redditor for 7 years, but I never expected the site to stick around: thats why I used my old BBS nick here, these days I only use it for throwaway accounts.\n\nAs a signal processing geek I was using MP3 in 1993/1994 the _decoders_ were not real time, friends thought I was crazy and that it was pointless, modems were still slow enough that transferring songs was still far slower than realtime even with the 10:1 compression. I had a cell modem in the mid 90s (CDPD) ... and lots of people thought cellular data was pointless (worked great for IRC and remote shells). I had pre-802.11 900MHz FHSS wlan equipment.  Oh well, I personally find smartphones mostly pointless myself, even to this day... but mobile data is awesome and the world finally figured out I was right about that one :)\n\nI\'ve seen plenty of things explode into mainstream use, and plenty of others fizzle out.  Bitcoin is potentially as revolutionary as anything I\'ve seen, but that doesn\'t guarantee its success. A lot of times a better marketed technically inferior solution wins out.\n The problems Bitcoin solves best are ones that many people don\'t realize they have. If people aren\'t convinced that decentralization is valuable to them Bitcoin may be eclipsed by centralized solutions which have better properties or at least better marketing, perhaps even by force as competitors try to buy public policy which is adversarial to Bitcoin.': 53, '[Does this answer your question?](http://imgur.com/cPuFYDT)\n\n*This photo is probably from just a couple years after I started programming.*': 5, "> please tell me about the Apple smart phone of 2002.....\n\nIt was a Samsung, called the i700.

See my edit, I still think it's worth considering at a very large scale for Bitcoin; greed* is a powerful force, and when you look at our current economic situation, part of the reason new USD can be created is because of how different entities interact with the USD.

Instead, they would "jam" the original chain by including only some or none of the pending transactions, and  ignoring and orphaning any blocks mined by the minorty miners.  Meanwhile, the cartel would be normally mining the other branch of the fork, with the modified protocol.  So, anyone who wanted to use his bitcoins would have to upgrade, and any miner had better swithch to work on that branch, or starve to death. \n\n(It has been claimed that, if a mining cartel tried to do that, users would rebel en masse and, rather than give in to the cartel, they would do a hard fork of their own, upgrading to a version of the protocol that the cartel can\'t mine or jam.

Therefore, by that logic, if the government  tried to remove the backing, the dollar would become worthless.  Well, at some point the government did just that, and the dollar did not become worthless.  Why do you assume that it would be different with bitcoin?\n\nIn fact, the thesis "the value of bitcoin would hardly be affected if the limit was raised" seems to me much more reassuring than the thesis "the limit will not be raised because that would render bitcoin worthless".
