It would continue to be the same until the next difficulty adjustment -- up to 2,015 blocks later.\n\nSo let\'s say mining against Bitcoin Core  (where the 1MB limit is enforced) gets 20% of the pre-fork hashing, and Bitcoin-XT (with larger limits) gets 80%.   BTC blocks would take about 50 minutes each.  Bitcoin-XT (BTX) blocks would take about twelve minutes each.   Difficulty on BTX (with 80%) would adjust in ~18 days, then blocks there would continue at the 10-minute target (ignoring growth or loss in hashing level since the hardfork began).  Difficulty on BTC (with just 20%) could stick at that level for more than two months, but then it would revert to about 13 minutes per block.

One problem with that is that fees go to the miner and become tainted, and thus we get deflation of the money supply (of untainted coins) as those fees received by miners are no longer spendable on both sides.\n\nThat's a minor problem compared to the real issue.  If the only good coins are the ones untainted with newly mined coins, who would want to buy the newly mined coins -- from either side?   So you have lost fungibility.

Your whole comment is completely irrelevant to his issue.\n\n": 2, "I've done a bit of investigating, and here are your legal options: http://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/37tntv/australian_exchange_igot_a_scam_28_days/crrvmt8\n\nThere was some funny business with that post, so for safety, here are the relevant parts:\n\n[**Note for mods**: I have not 'doxxed' anyone in this post. All of this information is publicly available on the Australian Company Register.]\n\nSome interesting facts and advice for those who find themselves in the same situation (**disclaimer, I am not a lawyer, this is not legal advice**):\n\nOur EFTs go to a bank account owned an Australian company '13th Pty Ltd' (ACN: 160 051 990), so these transaction are subject to Australian Consumer Law (the [ATO classifies bitcoins as 'goods'](https://www.ato.gov.au/General/Gen/Tax-treatment-of-crypto-currencies-in-Australia---specifically-bitcoin/), rather than currency). \n\nI hope that /u/dan_igot is aware of these facts, and has made the directors of '13th Pty Ltd' (Amit & Shivani Taneja) aware of them too. If not, he may be interested to know that by omitting the fact that they were unable to supply within a timely manner, '13th Pty Ltd' have probably engaged in ['misleading or deceptive conduct'](https://www.accc.gov.au/publications/advertising-selling/advertising-and-selling-guide/avoid-misleading-or-deceptive-claims-or-conduct/misleading-or-deceptive-conduct) which is prohibited by [section 18 of the Australian Consumer Law](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2013C00620/Html/Volume_3#_Toc368657554). \n\nThere are some pretty good arguments that they have also breached more specific provisions of the Act too. For instance Sub-Section 36(3) of the ACL ('Wrongly Accepting Payment') states:\n\n> A person must not, in trade or commerce, accept payment or other consideration for goods or services if, at the time of the acceptance:\n>                     (a)  there are reasonable grounds for believing that the person will not be able to supply the goods or services:\n>                              (i)  within the period specified by or on behalf of the person at or before the time the payment or other consideration was accepted; or\n>                             (ii)  if no period is specified at or before that time\xe2\x80\x94within a reasonable time; and\n>                     (b)  the person is aware or ought reasonably to be aware of those grounds.\n\n/u/dan_igot may also be interested to know that the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission doesn't go after people because they are 'big fish', but because the breach relates to a novel situation or a new 'wild west' market (reasoning that a big public example will deter future misconduct of the same kind). The penalties range from: \n\n* fines in the tens of thousands of dollars \n\n* director disqualification for long periods of time (i.e. can't start or run a company for 10 years)\n\n* up to criminal prosecution and imprisonment. \n\nOn an unrelated note, does Australia have extradition treaties with your current country of residence, or any countries you are likely to travel to /u/dan_igot?\n\nTo anyone in a situation like mine, here's my advice (keep all records and receipts btw):\n\n* First exhaust the possibility of resolving this through regular 'customer service' channels (like I have)\n\n* Write a ['complaint letter'](https://www.accc.gov.au/consumers/complaints-problems/write-a-complaint-letter) addressed to the directors of 13th Pty Ltd (Amit & Shivani Taneja). Send this letter, via **registered** snail mail to 13th Pty Ltd's 'principle place of business': 15A Ramsay Avenue, SEACOMBE GARDENS SA, 5047.\n\nIf this doesn't resolve the situation, you have the option of doing one, or any combination of:\n\n* Going to small claims court and getting (what will likely be) a 'default judgement' (basically a court order saying the company must pay you the money they owe). If they don't cough up (likely, given past experience), engage the South Australian Sheriff's Office to repossess property from their 'principle place of business' which can be sold to cover your debt and pay Sheriff fees.\n\n* Write letters of complaint to your State and the SA Offices of Fair Trading, who may commence investigations.\n\n* Write letters of complaint to the ACCC, who may consider the situation 'novel' enough to commence court proceedings against 13th Pty Ltd (and, depending on severity, prosecution of those connected to the company, potentially even prosecutions *in absentia*).\n* If igot owe you more than $2000, you can issue a letter of 'statutory demand' under section 459E of the Corporations Act 2001, which requires them to pay you within 21 days. If they don't pay up within that time, you can then apply to a court to have the company 'wound up' (essentially, the company is presumed insolvent and placed into voluntary administration, and is often eventually liquidated). This also applies if you go the small claims route and get a judgement in your favour (for an amount of $2000), but its probably more in your personal interests to just get your money back by repossessing and selling their stuff.\n \nOnce last thing /u/dan_igot. Given the company we've all been transacting with is (a) an Australian registered company with (b) all 100 shares held by 4 individuals, 3 living in Australia (75% Australian share ownership), how does your business model work exactly? \n\nI assume 13th Pty Ltd is effectively controlled by some offshore company. How do you transfer profits from this Australian subsidiary, owned entirely by individuals, to a foreign head company with no actual share ownership (and therefore no access to dividend distribution)? At least, barring some kind of transfer-pricing scheme? I also note that 13 Pty Ltd is registered for GST, yet does not apply GST to their transactions. Might want to take note of stuff like [this](https://www.ato.gov.au/Media-centre/Media-releases/Hundreds-of-tax-cheats-convicted/).\n\n**followup post**\n\nLike others here, my guess is that igot have cashflow problems and are trying to buy themselves some time to 'right the ship'. I hope this isn't the case, for two reasons:\n\n* If they're actually being truthful, we'll get out money back eventually.\n* Knowingly trading while insolvent is a very serious **criminal** offence under the Corporations Act. Penalties are levied against company directors personally (i.e. they 'pierce the corporate veil'), and can include: $440,000 in fines, direct liability to compensate creditors, and up to 5 years imprisonment.\n\nEssentially, the directors of 13th Pty Ltd could be saps who find themselves bankrupt and in prison for simply being unaware (which is a shaky legal defence btw, as directors have legal obligations to remain informed about their company's financial position).  \n\nSome time this week I plan to write to the directors of 13th Pty Ltd (copying in ASIC), to make sure they **are** aware. This serves a dual purpose: it's possible they're being kept in the dark, and it means they cannot claim in subsequent criminal proceedings they were unaware of their company's financial position.": 1, '>We will have the current issues fixed imminently.\n\nApparently "imminently" meant "weeks"': 1, ">I sent http://www.reddit.com/user/shtan proof of his payment an hour ago (he was an OP of one of these posts).
