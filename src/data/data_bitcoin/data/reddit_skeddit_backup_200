Tight coupling is particularly at odds with the concerns raised in section 4.3.

Most of 2015 it was reasonably stable.\n\nHave you had any issues with retailers regarding refunds?\n\nRetailers dont like doing refunds whatever the payment method. There is a case for consumer protection to cover Bitcoin better though. However cash has the same problem.\n\nDo you think the future prosperity of bitcoin lies with the decisions of governments?\n\nNo. The future prosperity of countries may depend on embracing digital currency. There is an economic pressure for less friction in transferring value globally. How far that is specifically tied to Bitcoin or something else is speculation. \n\nAre credit cards deemed a safer method of online purchasing since you are able to perform charge backs?\n\nYou are only looking at this from a narrow viewpoint. A retailer is better off without charge backs. Retailers are carrying a business risk accepting credit cards if a criminal targets them buying goods with stolen numbers. Consumers need to provide a credit card number, expiry date and security number for a purchase. So essentially they are giving away all the data someone needs to use a card fraudulently. Bitcoin is way ahead on security. Consumer protection could be built in with an escrow system to protect online purchases to ensure delivery.\n\nIn your opinion, do articles that demonise bitcoin play a major role in the amount of people using this technology?\n\nMainstream media associate Bitcoin with hackers, criminals, drug dealers and will erroneously title people as a "Bitcoin chief" or "Bitcoin CEO". Most mainstream journalism on Bitcoin is sensationalist uninformed rubbish. It follows that people who hear about Bitcoin regard it as some kind currency for criminals.\n\nIn the case of your own government showing negativity towards bitcoin, do you worry about transactions being traced back to yourself?\n\nMost transactions are electronic now. All mainstream banking can be traced unless you go to extraordinary efforts to avoid it. My only \'worry\' is that if use of Bitcoin is demonised to huge extent then Governments, ignorant of most technology, will assume someone using Bitcoin just is a criminal because they use it.': 1, 'You brought up good points regarding the credit card question as I had only been looking at it through the eyes of the customer so that gives me more to outline. Thanks!': 1, 'Thanks for taking the time to do this, much appreciated!': 1, "> 1. What in your opinion is the primary aspect preventing large retailers from adopting bitcoin?\n\nEase of use.  Bitcoin has come a long way but it is still hard/intimidating buying and using it for the average punter.  Think of the internet during the 80's.\n\n> 2. Does the largely fluctuating value stop you from ordering high value items?\n\nA bit, I don't let it stop me but it is always niggling in the back of my mind that in 10 years, if we get adoption, the price of bitcoin is going to be ridiculous.\n\n> 3. Have you had any issues with retailers regarding refunds?\n\nThe only bitcoin refund I ever received was from ButterFly labs...  That was painful for reasons other than bitcoin.\n\n> 4. Do you think the future prosperity of bitcoin lies with the decisions of governments?\n\nNo.  We tend to get a bit tunnel visioned about this I think but the chances of world governments getting together and deciding on something like banning bitcoin is slim to none.  They cannot even agree on who are the bad guys let alone on something that is agenda neutral.\n\n> 5. Are credit cards deemed a safer method of online purchasing since you are able to perform charge backs?\n\nDepends, if you are a merchant it is great, if you are a consumer it is not so good, my rule of thumb is don't buy off anyone that does not have a few names of real people and a brick and mortar address.  It has worked so far for me.\n\n> 6. In your opinion, do articles that demonise bitcoin play a major role in the amount of people using this technology?\n\nNot particularly, there are a lot of people that will just follow what media says but what media is saying has changed a lot in the last few years.  \n\n> 7. In the case of your own government showing negativity towards bitcoin, do you worry about transactions being traced back to yourself?\n\nNot me personally.

Often the pressure is nested many levels deep, so good luck finding out for sure where it\'s actually being applied.

Miners can subscribe and unsubscribe at any time creating enough decentralisation to secure the network. \n\nIt's pretty simple: If mining is centralised, then bitcoin's value goes down, forcing miners to switch pools. \n\nThis even applies to creating huge mining farms, which could become too big by themselves. The gains in efficiency by creating a huge mining farm doesn't outweigh the destruction of the value of Bitcoin. \n\nThis whole decentralisation which is supposedly caused by increased block size is grossly overstated anyway. This has never been the case and there is no data to suggest it will be (without cherry picking). ": 2, "Let's first touch on the primary reason pools exist:\n\nThey allow you to mine bitcoin and be paid at more regular intervals.\n\nWhen you're solo-mining with a few machines in your basement, you'll generate a block once every few *years* or so. This isn't very useful if you have electricity bills to pay, and you have no idea when you find the next block. Joining a large pool has the significant benefit of ensuring regular payments at your share of the hashrate, thereby allowing you to have more certainty over the current and future sustainability of your mining operation.\n\nIn principle, pools are a sensible thing to have.\n\n-----\n\n1.\n\nMost pools (//edit: actually, I'm not too sure if this is still the prevalent mining protocol on the network) are run by a single centralised operator, and people that contribute hashpower to it typically have no idea what they are mining, nor do they have any control over it other than by leaving; the transaction selection policy these pools are running is at the sole discretion of the pool operator. This is the Stratum mining protocol (on top of getwork). It's very efficient, very quick, very easy to set up. But it's tending toward centralisation into pools that might aswell be treated as a single corruptible miner (ie. GHash.io), because contributors have no control. So all-in-all, as far as decentralisation goes, this isn't great.\n\n2.\n\nThere's also the 'getblocktemplate' variety of mining. This allows miners to choose their own transaction selection policy. For this reason, it doesn't tend toward centralisation in the same way Stratum/getwork mining does, because miners participating in a pool that runs this protocol do not submit to the pool operator's whim. But it's harder to set-up and not as accessible to dumb miners in the same way Startum/getwork is. If all pool mining were done via getblocktemplate, then that would be fantastic for decentralisation.\n\n3.\n\nThird, there's P2Pool. This allows participants to contribute mining power, have gradual and frequent payouts, and have *full control* over the transaction selection policy. As far as individual/independent control goes, it's excellent. But you need to run a full node to use it - which, to some miners, is a barrier (because they're lazy). Also, if you're merged mining, then you need to run nodes for each chain you're merge-mining. It isn't plug-and-play like the alternatives.\n\nThere's also the problem where P2Pool *itself* can be 51% attacked: P2Pool is essentially another blockchain that, instead of bitcoin-transferring-transactions, contains shares which represent some amount of work. This allows the pool to reward the owners of shares some amount of bitcoin (when this pool finds a block) in a way it's decentralized - but, exactly like bitcoin, this is vulnerable to a 51% attack because some majority miner on this pool can rewrite history and make everyone elses contributions useless. P2Pool can never solve the 51% problem even if 100% of miners are on it for this reason.\n\nAlso, for various reasons, P2Pool has a slightly higher orphan rate than centralized pools have - because centralized pools can run a more efficient operation.\n\n> If centralisation is an ongoing issue why do we not make a global 'everyone switch to p2pool day' and get every home miner and hopefully a few large scale miners to join.\n\nSee this response by G. Maxwell:\n\nhttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=399313.msg4318355#msg4318355\n\n> If it doesnt work miners only loose one days profit, if it does work we fix the centralisation problem and begin to create an enormous global network effect for p2pool with every new miner joining.\n\nBear in mind miners operate on vapor thin margins - a day's worth of pointless mining is *very* costly.\n\nAlso, if everyone is on p2pool then that isn't all that great; p2pool runs a 30-second sharechain that's essentially the same as Bitcoin's, but with lower difficulty - if everyone runs on this pool then, essentially, this increases payout frequency by only 20 compared to solo-mining. Also, you'll have an output for every contributing miner in every single coinbase of every single block, for example (which, admittedly, isn't all that bad if everyone is on this pool). And it doesn't solve any fundamental majority-miner problem.\n\n------\n\nPersonally, widespread pooled mining through getblocktemplate rather than Stratum - I think - would already be a huge step in the right direction.": 1}, ("I thought it would be more fun and more accurate for Bitcoin holders if someone could make web page like Global Rich List has.

But I have talked with many people who have, as well as reading and researching a bit. \n\nSo here comes my completely unqualified but not completely uninformed opinion on the matter. \n\nMacri wants to end capital controls. I\'m saying sure, but he might not be able to, at least not right away (a possibility). \n\nThe problem is that he will have to deal with several issues to make that happen.\n\nOne issue, often overlooked in politics in general, is the entrenched ideas of the bureaucracy. Argentina has been under Peronist rule for the vast majority of the past 70 years. Peronism is based on different interest groups coming together and divvying up the spoils. So, one can assume that the bureaucracy is entrenched and if they are hostile to reform (like in many other places) it will present a formidable obstacle.\n\nBut I think the results of the vote makes it very clear that the Argentinian people are fed up with capital controls. So let\'s assume that the bureaucrats were so fed up that they voted Macri too. \n\nHere comes the next problem. Argentina refused a debt payment on some national debt that had been partially bought by some vulture fund that was blocking debt renegotiation. A solution to this can be found, and once it is, then Argentina can again get access to New York capital markets.\n\nFurthermore, the Argentinian Peso has two exchange rates. The official exchange rate and the blue dollar rate (black market rate). Officially, you can get about 9 pesos per USD. But if you go to the black market, you will (last time i checked) get 16 pesos per usd! So if he quits the capital controls over night and lets the peso float freely the government would also lose lucerative income from the companies that are currently forced to pay the official rate (which then means cuts in government budgets). \n\nBut in the end is a confidence game. If he manages to present a plan that analysts deem credible and that makes them forecast gdp growth for Argentina, then the Peso will strengthen from removing the capital controls. If, on the other hand, people don\'t belive it will work, then the peso will be in an even worse free fall than it already has been as people now can move money freely out of the peso from their bank accounts. \n\nThese are some of the difficulties he will have to deal with. In the end, it is basically a confidence game. \n\nI believe that it could be that lifting capital controls becomes delayed, or maybe a gradual process that takes place over time. Otherwise, if the capital controls are lifted in a poorly executed way, without a comprehensive credible plan, then that might lead to even increased amounts of inflation and total implosion of the peso. In that case, you wouldn\'t have "capital controls", but you would still have great economical incentives to use bitcoin. \n\nPersonally, I hope Macri has what it takes to reverse the peronist mess without creating and even bigger one. \n\nOne interesting aspect I came over in this article (that I read with Google translate): http://www.infobae.com/2015/08/13/1748192-las-cinco-promesas-que-les-hizo-macri-los-empresarios\n\nHe says something about shares. That keeping a currency gives you a share in the national economy of that currency. And that he believed that it would be much better for Argentinians to have a share in their own economy instead of the US one. That being said, bitcoin is country neutral and a growth sector in the economy...so his remarks are in line with bitcoin and he would have no reason to fight it even though he is unable to change the current system in a meaningful way. \n\nAnyway, after writing this I came across a fresh off the press article in FT about similar issues to what I\'ve written here: http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/117bbe2c-9417-11e5-b190-291e94b77c8f.html': 2, 'Yeah, I wish you had written the article.
