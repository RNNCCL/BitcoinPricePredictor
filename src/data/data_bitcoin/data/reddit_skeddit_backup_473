A direct bank means a bank that has no branches rather operates online or over the phone only. This makes significant savings in operating expenses to the bank and some of these savings get passed onto customer (like no fees and better interest rates). Rather than encourage the typical big bank activity of going to meet with a financial adviser to get scammed out of your money from completely biased advice they actively encourage user based discussions on their forums to get unbiased advice. \n\nFidor specifically is very pro Bitcoin. They are partnered with Bitcoin.de and seek to innovate. While they haven't exactly integrated Bitcoin into their bank the day may come and their CEO is rather fond on Bitcoin. \n\nFor anyone who doesn't know the rate difference between a good direct bank and brick and mortar banks can be quite drastic. For example big Canadian banks right now are paying roughly 0.8% interest on a savings account. But that's low which is why I have the highest rate in the country at 2.5% in my savings account. In the US you see Bank of America offering a joke of 0.03% on savings account yet anywhere in the US everyone can get 1.05% from Synchrony Bank. If your off comparing about expensive fees at your bank, go, use a direct bank. I don't pay fees. I believe that first banks we will see adopt Bitcoin will naturally be direct banks as they have nothing to lose (direct bank are already no fees) so they are only benefiting the consumer.

As far as I know MAXM doesn't really do small retail either, so it's possibly an institution. \n\nThe 350 USD per BTC price equivalent baffles me though.": 5, 'This is *incredibly* misleading - it was misleading as a talking point yesterday, and is doubly misleading as an "article" now. \n\n(1) There are no GBTC securities for sale on the OTC markets. Zero. You could bid eleventy bazillion dollars for shares that don\'t exist, and it would be risk free, because *there aren\'t any shares to buy.* Order books are incredibly dynamic - often algorithmically dynamic - and that goes double for published and public order books. There is no reason to expect shares to trade for that price. \n\n(2) Eventually, SOME current shareholders MIGHT complete a deposit process that would allow them to trade their shares on the OTC markets. Readers of /r/bitcoin do not know when this will happen, but for market participants - who are on the phone with one another all day and have experience with DTC timelines, OTC markets, and new securities coming to market, *the first trades will not be a surprise*. They\'re going to know when there are securities for sale, at which point they will have **no reason** to bid with an enormous premium. Even if they\'re willing to pay that, there\'s no reason to let such a bid sit in an orderbook when they could likely get shares much closer to spot/NAV price. \n\n(3) To expand on that, I have not heard a single compelling reason for GBTC shares to trade for a premium over the bitcoin spot price. Most importantly, institutional investors are entirely capable of buying bitcoin directly, buying shares of GBTC from the fund directly at its NAV (subject to a 12-month lockup period), and entering into more exotic arrangements that you can\'t get on e-trade but *which are common in the financial industry.* Take gold ETFs as an example: they generally trade at a discount to the spot price of gold, and while they increased the accessibility of gold to many investors, institutional investors had plenty of access to gold, gold futures, and gold derivatives beforehand. Bitcoin isn\'t that mature, but it\'s not worlds apart either: GBTC (or the COIN ETF) will *not* be the first, or the only, means of "institutional investors" (however defined) to gain exposure to bitcoin in a compliant fashion. There are huge numbers of other asset classes - commodities, real estate, currencies, etc. - that all kinds of institutional investors have money in, and have had money in long before exchange-traded securities existed as a vehicle for them to do so.\n\nFor all of those reasons, "bids" on securities that *don\'t exist and can\'t be traded* represent no information about the state of the market or the market to-be. The article has no information in it that can\'t be gleaned from looking at one OTC market\'s public order book and running some google searches. \n\n- - - - -\n\nFor more background on GBTC itself, in particular why it is not an ETF and shouldn\'t be expected to directly impact the bitcoin market to a great degree, see my post [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/33rhg9/reality_check_on_the_gbtc_fund/).\n\nMost importantly, there will be no systematic arbitrage opportunity connecting the GBTC fund and the price of bitcoin itself. Even if the shares trade at a premium, there will be no way for new shares to be purchased without being subject to the 12-month lockup period. If supply gets low, it will just stay low, and the end result will be *illiquidity* not purchase pressure on bitcoin. \n\nAnd any potential purchaser of GBTC shares OTC has and will have the option of purchasing shares directly from GBTC subject to the 12-month lockup.': 14, 'Nobody is bidding anything, it\'s just window painting.
