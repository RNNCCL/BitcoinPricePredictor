Say they're sequence numbers instead. A sends a proposed transaction to both B and C. B and C can already communicate with each other to realize that A is trying to double spend. The issue is only in determining which of these transactions gets considered valid. Hell, that's not even really needed I suppose. Once B and C realize that A is trying to double spend, they can reject both transactions. They achieve this just by communicating prior to verifying the transaction.\n\n> The solution for this consensus problem, a Byzantine generals problem (read your wiki link! It mentions the Byzantine failure), had been researched for decades and only successful now... 3 in fact. There is simply no other way that is simple. Otherwise Bitcoin wouldn't have been the revolutionary technology it is today.\n\nI'm having some trouble parsing your first sentence but it sounds like you're saying the Byzantine generals problem was not solved until Bitcoin? I don't think that's right... [there's a paper about the problem from 1982](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/pubs/byz.pdf), and it's been proven (I believe in that paper) that Byzantine consensus is possible if and only if a super majority of the nodes are non-faulty.\n\nI don't think global consensus is needed in the case of identifying double-spending, though, we just need an individual node to know whether a transaction represents a double-spend or not. To this end a node can just communicate with all other nodes. If any node reports a transaction that is a double spend of a coin, those two nodes now know to reject that transaction.": 1, "Because the network is not centralized. In a decentralized system you can broadcast a txn to many directions at the exact same time. For simplicity let's say 2, north and south. Please bear in mind the explanation below is a simplistic take on the concept:\n\nIf the two txns that were communicated to north and south were txns sending to two different recipients, then the fastest one to propagate wins, and the other is considered a double spend.\n\nNow assuming the travel speed is the same for both, there is a 50/50 split (approx) on who's transaction is right. Half the network has agreed on something the other half didn't.\n\nIn order to remedy whose transactions are correct, the proof of work is required to bundle one of the two txns. If you solve a block, you get to put your version of that txn. So who is able to solve a block matters, because they are in control of the bundling process.\n\nSo we don't want one miner to have all that control - that would be effectively a centralized system. So miners are forced to compete to find blocks that meet a certain criteria.\n\nEdit: the criteria of the proof of work is solving a block that has a certain number of 0's in front of a hashed block.\n\nHope this helps.": 2, "You're right the RSA the algorithm being correct does not help the implementations of it which had other flaws, but the algorithm itself is still secure, and there's nothing preventing secure implementations of it from existing.": 1, "> To verify the accuracy of the transaction data that is in the blockchain.\n\nIsn't RSA sufficient for this?

Miners are going ahead and hashing different nonces to try and get the right number of zeros, but they'd need a way of verifying that the transactions they're including in the hash are actually valid. See step 5 in section 5 in the pdf:\n\n>  4) When a node finds a proof-of-work, it broadcasts the block to all nodes.  \n5) Nodes accept the block only if all transactions in it are valid and not already spent\n\nAfter a proof of work is found, the network still needs to verify that the transactions in the block are valid.": 1, 'Jesus Christ, RES is really screwing me with comment editing lately. Original post follows:\n\nIf you have 10 bitcoins, and you send those 10 bitcoins to address1 and then try again to send 10 bitcoins to address2, you submit two transactions to the network. The way bitcoin is currently set up is that nodes will reject the second transaction they hear about, but if you are crafty, you can inject the two transactions at different points in the network, so some nodes will hear about the spend to address1 first and some will hear about the spend to address2 first. Which is the valid spend?\n\nThis is where the blockchain comes in (and where 0 confirmation transactions are sketchy); at some point, a block will be written into that chain that makes one of those transactions "official", and this is "1 confirmation". As more blocks get built onto the chain from that transaction, you get 2, 3, 4 etc confirmations.\n\nIf you only knew that there were multiple transactions that currently existed, how would you resolve the issue?
