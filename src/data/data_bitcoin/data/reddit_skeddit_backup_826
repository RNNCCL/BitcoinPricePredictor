Ownership od bitcoin can be transfered endlessly with out affecting the price.  It is only when exchanging it with another currency when supply and demand is relevant.  As the loop closes, and transactions happen between peers for goods and  services with out exchanging, the price is more likely to stabilize or slowly rise.  Because less coins are being exchanged back out into another currency,  the likely hood of the demand for new buyers will rise.  The same way the saving bitcoins make the price rise also works when sending them to new a dresses within the loop that do not sell them.  I strongly advise that any bitcoin holders only spend with Merchants that also hold.  Don't convert back into other currencies unless absolutely necessary.   \nThank you for the article.

But the problem is not in giving one crazy guy a bunch of tools, the problem is a whole government abusing the existing tools - or building upon them.  \nThere are way too many recent stories of using existing technology not the way as it was intended. Think of the truck toll on our Autobahn - designed to get some money from the heavy trucks, but suddenly the system is very interesting to track everybody with it. Uhm, I mean terrorists. For security reasons, of course.\n\nThe problem is, this has much larger consequences, and the same goes for encryption. There will be some incident which suddenly makes encryption look like a bad thing. Think of the police not being able to decipher some possibly incriminating hard drives or whatever - of course, some politicians will scream for the regulation of encryption, because everybody can hide illegal stuff with it. Sure, there are nice people using encryption. But they don't have anything to hide, right? Right guys?\n\nAnd boom, a domino effect starts ...\n\nSo to make myself clear: I'm highly sceptical where our goverments are heading, whether it is in the USA, the Netherlands or Germany. But you don't need to wait for some crazy person to come along and use this groundwork, it can happen *now* with political parties. There are politicians who decide stuff they have no idea about, lobbyists who have a lot of money and only one job - influencing politicians! - and there aren't enough people around who actually care about this.\n\nTo make one last connection to the rise of Hitler: It's not that there weren't any people who were against him and saw what was happening.
