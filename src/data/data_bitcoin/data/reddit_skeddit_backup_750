And the next generation of consumers are driving this change.\n\n>For decades, cryptographers have tried to disrupt the payments industry with new digital cash systems, but their efforts faded into obscurity, Rafael Pass, an associate professor of computer science at Cornell University told me during the Jacobs Technion-Cornell Institute\'s Future of Money conference last week. But the spread of Bitcoin as a decentralized, distributed, peer-to-peer electronic cash system has thrust cryptography into the mainstream over the past couple years.\n\n>"Now cryptography is cool," Pass said.\n\n>The conference, which was organized by renowed cryptographer, Ari Juels, revolved around how cryptography is shaping the evolution of money and payments.\n\n>"It\'s the dawn of a new era; I deeply believe that now it\'s not just hype," said Lauren Pollak, the financial services practice lead at Jump Associates, an innovation and consulting firm based in New York City. Because of the confluence of adaptations in technology, changes in consumer behavior and regulatory shifts, "there really are forces reshaping not only the financial system but money itself," she said during a presentation at the conference.\n\n>Although consumers typically think of money as physical notes and coins, this perception is changing as more payments move online. This shift is especially true for millennials, 71% of which would rather go to the dentist than visit a bank, according to the Millennial Disruption Index.\n\n>According to the research, 68% of millennials said that the way they access money will be totally different in five years and 71% said the way they pay will be completely different in five years.\n\n>Banks have relied on a few assumptions for their value proposition: Accessing large pools of capital is difficult; moving money from point A to point B, especially if it\'s across the world is problematic; and verifying both sides of a transaction is tough, said Pollak. "Those assumptions are becoming less and less true," she said.\n\n>Technologies like Apple Pay and Venmo are helping to make money more digital. Bitcoin is on the same path, but it still has many challenges ahead of it.\n\n>"Bitcoin is completely divorced from most of our everyday experiences," Pollak said. Its proponents need to decide what benefits to curate and then allow early adopters to dramatize those benefits, she said.\n\n>Bitcoin enthusiasts have traditionally zeroed in on the reduced cost and increased speed of transferring value over any distance, and the fraud reduction that could come from a system without the functionality for chargebacks and that logs every transaction on a public ledger called the blockchain.\n\n>But as the technology came under fire and the regulatory regime tightened, this rallying cry has diffused a bit. Bitcoin debit cards, for example, are meant to be a bridge technology, but they reinsert interchange fees and misjudge the need for plastic among a consumer base that is moving to mobile.\n\n>But if the cryptocurrency industry can reclaim its roots, it has significant opportunity to disrupt not only financial services and payments, but as hypothesized at the conference, equity markets through distributed IPO, legal systems through smart contracts and data preservation by recycling proof of work for storage.\n\n>And the next generation will be more likely to adopt these digital systems as their attachment to physical money dissipates. According to Pass, his young daughter was asked in school what paper dollar bills were used for, to which she said charity. She sees cash as something given to panhandlers on the street.

Gems is aimed towards the common user who doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have a crypto currency background. Since Gems are rewarded for network contribution, these users will own Gems just from operating within the network.\n\nRegarding privacy, communications are much more encrypted than the common social messaging app, like Whatsapp for example.\n\nInstant messages in Gems arrive in two flavors - standard and secret. Standard messages are the default type and provide a standard level of security. Secret messages are meant for highly confidential conversations and provide an extreme level of security and privacy. App users can switch between these two flavors for every chat conversation. Making a conversation secret is very easy, and only requires tapping on the "lock" icon inside the app. Instant messages are encrypted on two levels.\n\nThe first level of encryption is relevant for both standard and secret messages. For both types, all communications between the Gems mobile app and the Gems instant messaging cloud server are encrypted - this is also referred to as client-server encryption. Communications between the two is performed over SSL in a secure tunnel (HTTPS) with 256-bit keys. This prevents third-parties from listening in. This also prevents man-in-the-middle attacks and makes sure the Gems app only communicates with the real server and not anyone impersonating it.\n\nThe second level of encryption is only relevant for secret messages. On top of the client-server encryption, secret messages also have client-client encryption. Every Gems app generates a unique random pair of 4096-bit public/private keys upon installation. The public key is propagated within the network, but the private key never leaves the device. The public/private pair is unique to a device. If the user transfers his Gems account to a new device, a new pair is created. The key pair is also expired and refreshed periodically to enhance security. When user A sends a secret message to user B, it\'s encrypted using RSA 4096 with user B\'s public key. Once the message arrives to user B\'s device, it\'s decrypted with B\'s private key. Decryption can only take place on user B\'s device because only this device has access to the correct private key.\n\nThe benefit of client-client encryption is that it provides a zero trust environment. The encrypted message cannot even be decrypted by the Gems server infrastructure. This means that even if the Gems servers have been compromised and hacked into, secret messages are still 100% private and can only be decrypted by their rightful recipient.\n\nThe drawback of secret messages is that they cannot appear in push notifications. Since push notifications are encrypted by Apple\'s/Google\'s infrastructure, they don\'t conform to zero trust policy. When a secret message is sent from user A to user B, the push notification user B receives contains the text "You\'ve received a secret message from A" instead of showing the actual content of the message.': 6, 'Did you see the link? Because of no fees and obviously creating a new token that they can reward the users without actually using the btc that they need for development makes sense to me.

They definitely know about them as they\'re marketing bullet points \'til the end of time, but there\'s no real confusion arisen because of them. \n\nHowever, a "bit" in Bitcoin entirely breaks from that. First, it\'s expected to be a commonly used term - which, hey, I suppose could work if the entire rest of the system wasn\'t built around the Bitcoin. Second, which compounds the first and makes it truly an issue, is that this has nothing at all to do with "bits" in the traditional computing sense, yet Bitcoin is strictly a digital currency.

But both are bad, for different reasons:\n\n * without merged-mining, hashpower will be fragmented between multiple chains. e.g. imagine there are chains A, B, C, D, each having 25% of total hashpower. This means that miners of B and C can unite and wreck chain A.\n * with merged-mining, a miner can decide to attack chain A while still getting rewards on chain B\n\nIn principle, merged-mining can secure any amount of blockchains, but the security will be at mercy of large mining pools. If those mining pools are honest, you get, basically, unbreakable security.\n\nBut there are incentives for them to stay honest. E.g. imagine a side chain generates 10 BTC per day in tx fees, while the total amount of bitcoins in there is 10,000 BTC.\n\nSo miners have two options:\n\n1. mine for 1000 days to get 10,000 BTC in mining revenues from this sidechain\n2. attack the chain and get 10,000 BTC\n\nI don't see why they would prefer option 1.\n\nNote that an argument that miners won't attack because that would make coins worthless doesn't work here: miners will only wreck a sidechain, Bitcoin will be fine.": 1, "You realize you are appealing to popularity here, right?

Are miners who are rational criminals?\n\nSo it looks like you cannot explain why sidechains are secure without resorting to a psychological analysis.': 2, "> so did you:\n> > However, bitcoin users might be affected indirectly.\n\nA security analysis and cost/benefit analysis are subject to different criteria.\n\nWhen you're trying to prove that sidechains are secure, a claim that the attack on a sidechain is not possible because it will make bitcoin less valuable is a very weak argument.\n\nHowever, when you're studying feasibility of sidechain implementation, it's not a weak argument.\n\nBy the way, an assumption that mining equipment is worth more than 10,000 BTC is also questionable. Let's say one can mine 100,000 BTC over useful lifetime of the equipment, but that doesn't mean that equipment is worth 100,000 BTC: miners' operating income will be much smaller than their revenues due to electricity costs. Thus net present value of a cash stream one expects to get from mining might be less than amount locked in the sidechain.\n\n> your attack stated 70% hashrate attack but bitcoin itself is not secure at that rate.\n\nSidechains give miners an incentive to collude. Without sidechains miners do not have this incentive: even if 70% of the Bitcoin miners collude, it will still be extremely hard to steal anything on scale of 10,000 BTC.\n\n> but one of the game-theory costs of theft is the risk and cost of being apprehended.\n\nWhether grabbing coins from a sidechain is a theft is debatable. From miners' perspective, there is a Bitcoin output which can be unlocked using PoW, so is it criminal to use PoW to unlock it?\n\nE.g. Peter Todd offered a reward for finding a SHA1 collision: http://lists.randombit.net/pipermail/cryptography/2013-September/005301.html\n\nOn the other hand, to earn money on double-spending you'll have to interact with a merchant or an exchange, and at that point a criminal intent will be obvious.\n\n> it can be hard to hide a datacenter with 200 petahash in it and hard to hide the purchase, delivery and ownership. its also relatively immobile and subject to forfeiture.\n\nSo... sidechain security depends on law enforcement?\n\nJeez, can't you just admit that it is a centralized system in disguise of a decentralized one.\n\nA sidechain will be secure if and only if a majority of the mining power _agrees_ to secure it. Thus is depends on a _collusion_ among miners to be secure.\n\n> sidechains is quite similar to bitcoin security model: it relies on saboteurs to be the minority.\n\nBitcoin is much more game-theoretically sound, as rational miners will follow the protocol under fairly broad assumptions.\n\nBut to get a game-theoretic proof of sidechain security, you need to introduce things like psychology and law-enforcement into your model, which suggest that sidechains are deeply troubled in this sense.\n\nA PoW/PoS hybrid might be much better in this respect, so I don't think it makes sense to rush a PoW-only implementation.": 2, '> A sidechain will be secure if and only if a majority of the mining power agrees to secure it. Thus is depends on a collusion among miners to be secure.\n\nLike bitcoin it depends on honest majority following the protocol, no collusion.

If that happened it would be devastating for Bitcoin in general, far more destructive than say a MtGox failure. \n\nhaving trust is important, knowing who you are trusting is important, introducing new incentives to distribute that trust over the network is a good idea but only when there is central authority who is instrumental in initiating it.

Isn\'t stability and adoption more important?  Adoption by retailers and service providers seems to be quite high compared to just a year ago. The value against the dollar is way more stable than a year ago also.  The problem I see is consumer adoption, i.e. making a Bitcoin purchase more attractive than alternatives (Credit Card, Paypal, Cash).  Right now there isn\'t really a tangible incentive to acquiring Bitcoin (which usually has a fee), and safely holding on to it before a purchase is made.  Unless you\'re buying something "anonymously" of dubious legality (don\'t get me wrong, I think drugs should be legal).\n\nAnd so what if it never dominates the world\'s current top currency (for how many more years will this be the USD?!)?  Does Bitcoin have to have a universal acceptance in order for it to be worthwhile?  I don\'t think so... unless you\'re someone who\'s holding onto a few and expect to become incredibly wealthy by speculation.

I know that people argue that the ability to short currencies and assets is part of the free market and price discovery mechanism, however what they never mention is that shorting is open to corruption in a way that does not act symmetrically in the market.\n\nShorting is basically betting with another person that the price of bitcoin is going to be lower at some part in the future. Once you have made that bet, it is in your interests for the price of bitcoin to fall and also in your interests to spread fear, uncertainty and doubt about bitcoin. Any currency or asset is far more likely to fall 5% on an unfounded rumour than it is to rise 5%, therefore the net effect of shorting is to drive prices down for no reason other than personal greed. A small number of people going 'short' has the same effect as a much larger number going 'long'.\n\nShort selling of bitcoin causes instability in price and coordinated groups of short sellers can spread misinformation and rumours, causing holders to panic and sell. 'Naked shorting' where you bet with assets you don't own, is illegal in most regulated markets.\n\nMany currencies have been brought down by shorting. On 16 September 1992 the British  government was forced to withdraw the pound sterling from the European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM) after it was unable to keep the pound above its agreed lower limit in the ERM. George Soros, the most high profile of the currency market investors, made over 1 billion GBP profit by short-selling sterling.\n\nIn case you are about to say that it is the instability of the currency or asset that brings them down, not the shorting, I'm just going to repeat that it is the ability of shorters to manipulate market sentiment asymetrically downwards by spreading FUD, that causes unnecessary and unwarranted damage to assets, not their short positions.": 6, 'cheer up Debbie downer /u/changetip private 500 bits': 6, 'RemindMe! 2 years "$380 two years ago"': 2, 'Price is roughly the perfect indicator, by definition.
