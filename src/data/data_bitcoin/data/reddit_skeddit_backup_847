Right now it\'s not for the faint of heart, but once it grows up (assuming this grand experiment succeeds), these wild price swings will be tamed.\n\nIn fact, there\'s no reason to think Bitcoin won\'t be the thing people use to measure the value of fiat, as they point out how unstable those currencies are.': 3, '> If the price is "low", and people buy it, that brings the price back to the "appropriate" level. Without someone to do this, the price would keep falling lower and lower, or higher and higher, as no one would try to balance out these swings.\n\nIt\'s not about whether the price stays the same, it\'s about whether it\'s stable or not. Speculators don\'t just sell when the price goes up and buy when it goes down - commissions make margin trading in that way horribly inefficient and if you\'re as smart as you\'re trying to brag you should know that. It\'s not just about making any profit, that\'s easy, - it\'s about making a profit that actually justifies the time you\'ve spent and gives you a better cost of capital than you\'d have gotten just sticking the money into equity or bonds. Speculators will sell when they think the price isn\'t going to go up *any further*, which can often let the real price drift a long way from where it\'s actually supposed to be. And then if there\'s a blip that drains confidence it\'s going to rise any more, you get mass selling. The whole reason you get runs on banks and such in the mainstream economic climate is when investors pull out and accelerate a downward trend that might have been fine otherwise. \n\nTraditional currencies like the dollar don\'t ever stay at the same price, but major economic collapse aside, it\'s still stable. It\'s constantly changing but the changes are small (as you said originally, Bitcoin is currently seeing much higher inflation than USD/EUR right now, and that\'s despite it now being a period of relatively stability for Bitcoin value). Even when Scottish independence suddenly shifted towards actually being a feasible referendum outcome a few weeks ago, the British pound only fell by 1% - Bitcoin easily sees that kind of rise or fall on a daily basis for little discernible reason whatsoever. It\'s behaving far more like a stock index than a currency at the moment.\n\n> You bring up Forex, which is dominated by speculators, which do exactly that, keep things relatively stable.\n\nAbsolutely nothing you trade on Forex is dominated by speculators - they\'re all commodities where speculation has a minimal impact on supply and demand because the bulk of the total value in a commodity is held outside of margin trading and that acts as a massive ballast - the dollar could tank and look like a terrible investment but it would need to do that for ages before the masses would stop wanting/needing dollars and the main demand would actually drop.\n\nThe issue with Bitcoin, in particular Bitcoin at the end of 2013, is that most of the money going through it was speculation - it *was* dominated by speculators in a way that currencies, commodities and equities never are. The moment Bitcoin looks like it\'s peaked, nobody has a reason to hold Bitcoins any more and the demand totally crashes, until it gets so low that people figure it can\'t get lower and start buying again and you get exactly the kind of ridiculous dips and troughs that were around last December when it was fluctuating up or down by like 10% a day.\n\n> So you rail against speculators, and the solution is to have more speculators HODL?\n\nThat\'s not what I\'m saying whatsoever. What I\'m saying is that there has to be enough usefulness, enough demand for bitcoin in the public domain, that it becomes more than just a playtoy for people who are investing. It has to get to the point where more people are holding bitcoins to actually use them than people holding them to try and make a profit when they sell back to dollars. Speculators will still fluctuate the price, but by a much smaller amount and by an amount that won\'t wreak havoc with businesses that rely on bitcoins. Otherwise I would say there\'s no inherent value in Bitcoin as a concept other than a financial game dominated entirely by a fragile perception of whether USD per Bitcoin is going to be higher or lower next week or next month than it is right now.\n\nIt\'s not about whether speculators keep irrespective of the price, it\'s about whether speculation remains almost the sole driver of supply or demand.': 1, "Most people would prefer losing a guaranteed 2% than having reasonable chances at 70% loss even if a 400% gain is possible.  People are risk averse.  Losses are far more painful than gains are pleasurable.\n\nEarly adopters who aren't risk averse will never understand this mentality that makes up the majority of the population.": 14, 'The value has at least hit a consistent trend now, which actually makes it far more useful as a currency. It\'s a negative trend, which is far from ideal, but it at least seems to be predictable. It\'s still seeing much larger swings than any other currency or even share price, but it\'s resembling those sorts of graphs a lot more if you ignore the magnitude. \n\nI\'m pretty sure the fairly consistent drop in value is from people who came into bitcoin trying to make quick bucks from the gold-rush "to the moon!" stuff, and who are now slowly abandoning any hope of seeing $1000/BTC again and so are cutting their losses. Once the user-base again starts to be dominated by people trying to use the currency rather than exploit it to get rich quick, the price should stabilise because it has no reason to jump around all over the place.': 0, "The issue with speculators, in my opinion (which is clearly different to yours, but hey), is that they make the crashes and bubbles to begin with. If people are just holding bitcoin to hold bitcoin, to use it, to exchange to/from dollars when they need to, then across thousands of people that all averages out to a roughly stable exchange rate.\n\nWhen you've got people who are explicitly just trying to buy low and sell high, then those are the people who accelerate the positive and negative trends. They're the people who create bubbles and crashes because they're the only people who are actually giving a shit about the price of bitcoin in the first place. How often do you think average Americans ever look at the international exchange rates for the dollar or consumer price index - hardly at all, because when you're using it as a proper currency rather than an investment it's not a number that you concern yourself with, even though it does matter to you in terms of how much your money is worth. \n\nSpeculators were needed to pump enough money into bitcoin to actually get it off the ground and to have enough total value so that transactions are fractions of a fraction of a percent and *can* average out, but they're bad for people who are trying to actually live using bitcoin rather than traditional currency, because they tie Bitcoin's value to its perceived potential as an investment (which is very hard to predict and therefore fluctuates and is unstable), rather than to it's usefulness as a currency or payment method.\n\nAnd currencies don't need a predictable value to be a currency, but they need a predictable value to actually be a *useful* currency. If retailers can't operate on 30 or 90 day invoice terms and such on purchases because they have no idea what their bitcoin sales are going to be worth in 30 or 90 days, then they'll convert to a currency where they can. \n\nBitcoin is nothing more than a payment method so long as it's reliant on everyone changing it in and out of dollars, euros, or whatever at either end. Decentralisation aside, if that's how it's being used then it's functionally no different to the kind of electronic money transfers you get with Visa or Mastercard. Until widespread prices in Bitcoin represent prices in Bitcoin, rather than just prices in multiplied by the current BTC/USD exchange rate, then it's not its own currency. And it won't do that until the value of a bitcoin is at least somewhat approaching stable.": 0, "Strange, all this rising and falling and it wasn't useful as a currency.

The more speculators, the less that occurs, as a stable price over a long period of time can be determined faster.': 3, 'You realize that Bitcoin is inflating at a rate faster than the USD for the time being and for quite a decent amount of time?  The growth is coming from new people coming on board, not some kind of stability.': 10, '>>The issue with speculators, in my opinion (which is clearly different to yours, but hey), is that they make the crashes and bubbles to begin with. If people are just holding bitcoin to hold bitcoin, to use it, to exchange to/from dollars when they need to, then across thousands of people that all averages out to a roughly stable exchange rate.\n\nArgument by assertion.\n\n>>When you\'ve got people who are explicitly just trying to buy low and sell high, then those are the people who accelerate the positive and negative trends.\n\nCompletely backwards.  If the price is "low", and people buy it, that brings the price back to the "appropriate" level.  Without someone to do this, the price would keep falling lower and lower, or higher and higher, as no one would try to balance out these swings.  You bring up Forex, which is dominated by speculators, which do exactly that, keep things relatively stable.  For if they didn\'t, it would swing wildly any time anyone needed to switch from one currency to another.\n\n>>Speculators were needed to pump enough money into bitcoin to actually get it off the ground and to have enough total value so that transactions are fractions of a fraction of a percent and can average out, but they\'re bad for people who are trying to actually live using bitcoin rather than traditional currency, because they tie Bitcoin\'s value to its perceived potential as an investment (which is very hard to predict and therefore fluctuates and is unstable), rather than to it\'s usefulness as a currency or payment method.\n\nArgument by assertion again.\n\n>>nd currencies don\'t need a predictable value to be a currency, but they need a predictable value to actually be a useful currency. If retailers can\'t operate on 30 or 90 day invoice terms and such on purchases because they have no idea what their bitcoin sales are going to be worth in 30 or 90 days, then they\'ll convert to a currency where they can.\n\nHey more assertions without anything to back them up.  You are speaking of Unit of Account rather than currency.  Which is fine, don\'t use Bitcoin as a unit of account.  This does not make it less useful.  So things aren\'t denominated in Bitcoin, who cares?\n\n>>Bitcoin is nothing more than a payment method so long as it\'s reliant on everyone changing it in and out of dollars, euros, or whatever at either end. Decentralisation aside, if that\'s how it\'s being used then it\'s functionally no different to the kind of electronic money transfers you get with Visa or Mastercard. Until widespread prices in Bitcoin represent prices in Bitcoin, rather than just prices in multiplied by the current BTC/USD exchange rate, then it\'s not its own currency. And it won\'t do that until the value of a bitcoin is at least somewhat approaching stable.\n\nSo you rail against speculators, and the solution is to have more speculators HODL?  LOL.  Your confusion of the word currency with Unit of Account has led you down this path of complete idiocy.  May I suggest you try to learn the most basic of economic concepts before trying to rack your brain on anything more complex?\n': 4, "I'm not entirely sure what you're saying (how about you actually engage in discussion instead of just being blindly condescending, dismissive and what I can only assume is sarcastic)?\n\nIsn't the whole point of a currency that, even if it's an intangible man-made asset, it at least holds predictable value? The purchase of something in exchange for dollars is based on the idea that when you then want to exchange those dollars for another item, they're worth approximately the same amount in a few days or weeks' time, except cash provides an element of convenience that items such as gold do not.\n\nWith bitcoins this is only now even remotely starting to be the case - it's never really been useful as a currency before except for transactions where people almost immediately go to and from USD or some other fiat currency at either side. When a retailer determines the price by just converting the dollar price to bitcoins, and then immediately exchanges the bitcoins into dollars after the transaction, then that's not being a currency, that's just being a payment method. \n\nIt's still crappy that Bitcoin is falling in value and has been for the last six months, but it's doing so in at least a rough straight line for the last four or five months - it's gained what looks like an element of predictability compared to a year ago.\n\nI'm not trying to dismiss your point with blind naivity and stupid optimism here (go look at some of my other comments on here), but if I was running a business I'd much rather deal in a currency I can expect to be seeing 10% inflation each month than one which could be 200% deflation or inflation either way. 10% consistent inflation you can adjust prices and margins to accommodate for based on your accounting cycle, completely unpredictable and massive losses and gains you can't. \n\nAnd the fact that it's a negative trend should make it less appealing to the speculators and get-rich-quick investors in Bitcoin who were the whole cause of bubbles and crashes to begin with. Which puts a far greater proportion of bitcoins into the hands of people just looking to make payments with them.

However, they recognise that\nin exceptional circumstances such as either party getting "hit by a bus" they\nneed a backup plan to retrieve the funds. So they appoint their lawyer, Lenny,\nto act as a third-party.\n\n> With a standard 2-of-3 CHECKMULTISIG at any time Lenny could conspire with\neither Alice or Bob to steal the funds illegitimately. Equally Lenny may prefer\nnot to have immediate access to the funds to discourage bad actors from\nattempting to get the secret keys from him by force. However with CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY the funds can be stored in scriptPubKeys of\nthe form <code>. At any time the funds can be spent ... After 3 months have passed Lenny and one of either Alice or Bob can spend the\nfunds with the following scriptSig:\n\n\n\n> ===Non-interactive time-locked refunds===\n\n> There exist a number of protocols where a transaction output is created that\nthe co-operation of both parties to spend the output. To ensure the failure of\none party does not result in the funds becoming lost refund transactions are\nsetup in advance using nLockTime. These refund transactions need to be created\ninteractively, and additionaly, are currently vulnerable to transaction\nmutability. CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY can be used in these protocols, replacing the\ninteractive setup with a non-interactive setup, and additionally, making\ntransaction mutability a non-issue.\n\n\n> ====Two-factor wallets====\n\n> Services like GreenAddress store Bitcoins with 2-of-2 multisig scriptPubKey\'s\nsuch that one keypair is controlled by the user, and the other keypair is\ncontrolled by the service. To spend funds the user uses locally installed\nwallet software that generates one of the required signatures, and then uses a\n2nd-factor authentication method to authorize the service to create the second\nSIGHASH_NONE signature that is locked until some time in the future and sends\nthe user that signature for storage. If the user needs to spend their funds and\nthe service is not available, they wait until the nLockTime expires.\n\n>The problem is there exist numerous occasions the user will not have a valid\nsignature for some or all of their transaction outputs. With\nCHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY rather than creating refund signatures on demand\nscriptPubKeys of the following form are used instead <code>. Now the user is always able to spend their funds without the co-operation of\nthe service by waiting for the expiry time to be reached.\n\n\n> ====Micropayment Channels====\n\n> Jeremy Spilman style micropayment channels first setup a deposit controlled by\n2-of-2 multisig, tx1, and then adjust a second transaction, tx2, that spends\nthe output of tx1 to payor and payee. Prior to publishing tx1 a refund\ntransaction is created, tx3, to ensure that should the payee vanish the payor\ncan get their deposit back. The process by which the refund transaction is\ncreated is currently vulnerable to transaction mutability attacks, and\nadditionally, requires the payor to store the refund. Using the same\nscriptPubKey from as in the Two-factor wallets example solves both these issues.\n\n\n> ===Trustless Payments for Publishing Data===\n\n> The PayPub protocol makes it possible to pay for information in a trustless way\nby first proving that an encrypted file contains the desired data, and secondly\ncrafting scriptPubKeys used for payment such that spending them reveals the\nencryption keys to the data. However the existing implementation has a\nsignificant flaw: the publisher can delay the release of the keys indefinitely.\n\n> This problem can be solved interactively with the refund transaction technique;\nwith CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY the problem can be non-interactively solved using\nscriptPubKeys of the following form <code>. The buyer of the data is now making a secure offer with an expiry time. If the\npublisher fails to accept the offer before the expiry time is reached the buyer\ncan cancel the offer by spending the output.\n\n\n> ===Proving sacrifice to miners\' fees===\n\n> Proving the sacrifice of some limited resource is a common technique in a\nvariety of cryptographic protocols. Proving sacrifices of coins to mining fees\nhas been proposed as a \'\'universal public good\'\' to which the sacrifice could\nbe directed, rather than simply destroying the coins. However doing so is\nnon-trivial, and even the best existing technqiue - announce-commit sacrifices\n- could encourage mining centralization. CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY can be used to\ncreate outputs that are provably spendable by anyone (thus to mining fees\nassuming miners behave optimally and rationally) but only at a time\nsufficiently far into the future that large miners profitably can\'t sell the\nsacrifices at a discount.\n': 13, 'Wonder when we will actually see this in a release for bitcoin.

They are already solved.\n\nA colored coin has the base value of its value as a bitcoin, since you could just destroy the color and still use it as a bitcoin.  Trading the shares reflects that.\n\nSo if you buy $1000 worth of reddit shares and pay 2.6 bitcoins for it at a  bitcoin price of $400, and get a 0.1 colored bitcoin, that colored coin now is worth $1040 -- because it\'s 1/10 of a bitcoin and then it also represents $1000 worth of shares.  And you paid $1040 worth of bitcoin for it.\n\nIf the price of bitcoin goes from $400 to $500 and the value of your shares goes from $1000 to $800, your colored token is now worth $850 -- $800 for the shares, and $50 for 1/10 of $500, and you could trade it on an exchange for 1.7 bitcoins  (since bitcoins are at $500, and 850/500 = 1.7).\n\nIt\'s very simple math to figure out the value of a colored coin, since you know what fraction of a bitcoin it is, what the price of a bitcoin is, and what the price of a reddit share is.  This is basic math.\n\nReddit colored coins can be traded very easily just like any bitcoin or alt coin, and the price of the trade simply reflects the combination of the price as a bitcoin and the value as a share.\n\nAs for the 2 satoshi ordering problem, that\'s very simple to solve as well.  All colored coin implementations have an order that they specify in their protocols, which dictates how you follow the "real" colored coin through mixed transactions like that.  The protocol would specify that one of those satoshis is the colored one.

Essentially the only advantage that Colored Coins had was that you didnt need some kind of altcoin (i.e XCP) to create assets, only needing to spend a BTC miners fee. However counterparty now allows the creation of free assets which are way more powerful.. so yeah.\n\nI also have quite a bit of security concerns and see some red flags with the CoinPrism wallet and the people behind it (for instance, actually recommending to users that they just delete their private keys if they want to "lock in" the number of tokens issued for an asset, which is absurd..)': 1, 'if they use counterparty then this isnt an issue at all. Counterparty doesnt depend on any specific markings being maintained by inputs in the blockchain.

Whether there is a previously unknown vulnerability in the Tor network, or a tool that allowed the folks gathering evidence to bypass traditional security features in websites, that would be newsworthy.

But stating one thing that the agents know or should know to be false, when it is this wholly other unlawful thing, that\'s important to the defense. \n\nI mean, for all we know, the defendant in this case could have been discovered based on a bulk spying operation that captured a large swath of bulk internet traffic, domestically, without a warrant. That would be an easy reason to fight tooth and nail to hold on to the original declaration about how the site\'s IP address was discovered and subsequently compromised. \n\nBut even if we forget all of that, it seems like there was probably some amount of parallel construction used to effect the search in this case. There are a number of cases at the Federal District level that more or less refuse to hold the government accountable for parallel construction, and also deny the defense the right to have information about the true source of probable cause info in discovery when it comes from other executive branch security operations that are not publicly lawful, not traditionally used by investigators, and technologically speaking "hacking." \n\nAs a test case with high stakes and a lot of potential interest from privacy advocates, digital or crypto currency advocates, and as a referendum on our post-Snowden willingness to compromise digital security in ways we would never accept in their analog form, I find this case interesting even if it is not novel, but I\'m not sure that adds anything not already present in this discussion.

IP address 127.0.0.1 is commonly referred to in computer networking as \xe2\x80\x9clocalhost\xe2\x80\x9d i.e., the machine itself, which would allow the server to connect to itself. 65.75.246.20, as discussed ante, is the IP address for the front-end server, which must be permitted to access the back-end server. The \xe2\x80\x9cdeny all\xe2\x80\x9d line tells the web server to deny connections from any IP address for which there is no specific exception provided. \n\n25 | Based on this configuration, **it would have been impossible for Special Agent Tarbell to access the portion of the .49 server containing the Silk Road market data, including a portion of the login page, simply by entering the IP address of the server in his browser**. As discussed in \xc2\xb6 24, the server was configured to refuse connections from all outside IP addresses with only one exception, the front-end server IP. Certainly, the IP address of the machine that Tarbell attempted to connect with did not have this IP address, and the server would therefore have refused his connection attempt. \n\n\n.......\n\n\nConclusion \n51.

For example, that letter (which is Exhibit A to the government\xe2\x80\x99s opposition papers) **suggests the possibility of an alternative method for the government\xe2\x80\x99s identifying and locating the Silk Road Server**;  \n(3) **former Special Agent Tarbell\xe2\x80\x99s explanation is vague and lacks supporting documentary and forensic evidence that should exist if former Special Agent Tarbell had adhered to the most rudimentary standards of computer forensic analysis, but which he apparently did not follow, or failed to preserve evidence of his alleged work that could substantiate the government\xe2\x80\x99s account** (and which the defense has now requested);  \n(4) **several critical files** provided in discovery contain **modification dates predating** the first date Agent Tarbell claims Icelandic authorities imaged the Silk Road Server, thereby casting **serious doubt on the chronology and methodology** of his account; and  \n(5) the Government\xe2\x80\x99s version contains **additional inconsistencies, including items referred to and/or indicated by former Special Agent Tarbell\xe2\x80\x99s Declaration, but not produced in discovery**. \n\n52 | These **discrepancies between former Special Agent Tarbell\xe2\x80\x99s claims and the forensic reality of the discovery** cannot be resolved without an evidentiary hearing. \n\t ': 15, "Because most people who know everything don't": 3, 'If you go so far as to rebel against the system and get a felony, you are blacklisted from any kind of "mainstream" employment for life.': 8, 'Maybe stop talking like a stoned teenager then ': -1, 'This makes no mention of the Captcha.': 3, 'The USA is turning into a police state.

Many exchanges have started offering the ability to withdraw via Visa/MC not sure if British exchanges offer this. I know BTC-e does this with USD they do support GBP but not sure if that support is extended to this withdrawal option. \n\nBitcoin ATMs have high fees. What I would do is use Xapo. If I recall correctly they support GBP so you can just load up your Bitcoin into Zapo and then just spend seamlessly with their Visa debit. This will let you withdraw at pretty much any ATM in the UK and you only pay ATM service fee which will be cheaper than Bitcoin ATM. Xapo doesn't services the US so you will need to sign up once you are in the UK, make sure you sign up for GBP version and not USD version to avoid paying 3% foreign currency transaction fee. \n\nOn a fiat note. Look into Charles Schwab. They are an American [direct bank.] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_bank) essentially they service the whole of the US through the Internet. Their checking account is free with no fees which is the norm for direct banks. So you can keep them as your US bank and avoid monthly fees and minimum balances with what ever back you use now. What is awesome about Charles Schwab is they refund all international ATM services fees and network fees. So you can transfer your USD to them and use your USD debit cards with them to withdraw at any ATM in the UK and it will be free. I think they even pay most of the foreign currency transaction fee so this is actually one of cheapest way to get money while in the UK. Charles Schwab is also free wire transfers so if your send money to Bitfinex for example it won't cost you a lot. \n\nThere are however very nice arbitrage opportunities between American Bitcoin exchanges and European exchanges as  a whole. Even with service fees paid to Coinbase or if you just buy with Circle you can then send those Bitcoin immediately to Coinfloor and sell for GBP to withdraw to UK bank account. Even after fees and expenses you are making 1-2% profit off arbitrage. So that's the best way to send money once you have a UK bank account.
