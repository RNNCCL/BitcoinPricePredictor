They could be stored in a public Dropbox folder, but aren\'t they really stored on the blockchain?\n\n* "Secure - State-of-the-art encryption (256)" You may want to expand a bit on how your encryption scheme works.

You rock!\nI will fix those issues asap.\n\nI\'m now going to answer all the security questions:\n\n- we store your files (encrypted client-side with your password) because we want to make the process of certifying as easy as possible. We want to bring the power of the blockchain to everyone, not only geeks. It\'s hard for a "non-geek" user to understand that his files are certified but that he must still keep a copy. We want to make it as easy as registering a domain name: I just give my file, press the button, and here we are, it\'s certified, I can forget about it. We\'ll create a checkbox letting the user disable the upload function.\n\n- if you go to Certificates > then click on your file, you can see a button "Certificate" on the right, this contains all the "geek informations" needed to prove the ownership without Bitproof. This part is still not very user friendly, it\'s gonna be easier in the future. It contains a "TX" part (TXID you can check on blockr.io (blockchain.info doesn\'t index OP_RETURN transactions), you\'ll be able to see the OP_RETURN in the raw tx after 1 confirmation) and all the private/public key stuff used in the signature. (We basically send sha256(signature(sha256(file))) in the blockchain.\nWe also developed our own "super user friendly Blockchain proofs explorer", it\'s currently indexing, coming soon.\n\n- you need to create an account to certify something because all the private keys and stuff used in the certification process are encrypted and stored in our servers. It\'s a kind of Blockchain.info JS wallet, you need to create a wallet before creating transactions, because they let you access your wallet at any time and from anywhere with only your password.\nWe will also enable a function that lets geeks keep all the private keys and stuff on their own computer without the need to create an account. We wanted to make it simple to begin with a MVP as fast as possible.\n\nI posted this today on Reddit because we are looking for a strong use case we could focus on. We believe creating an API or something for OP_RETURN in the blockchain isn\'t something very interesting: chain.com or blockcypher could do it pretty easily.

(In which case, that would still be hard-coded to localhost.)\n\nBut on second thought again, it would be bad form to have those both on the same host anyway.  That would increase attack surface.

This creates an equivalent credit that the lender is entitled to redeem.  \n-If the price does indeed drop, they use the credit to buy back BTC, receiving more BTC than before.  \n+If the price goes up, they can still buy BTC back, but receive less than before\n\n> 3.)

(receiving more bitcoin in the end)  \n-If the price goes down, they must pay back more bitcoin than they lent out, covered by their collateral deposit. \n\nIf all of this sounds confusing, the TL;DR is that you lend bitcoin if you think the price will drop, and accept bitcoin if you think the price will rise.

When you vote, it gives you your encrypted ballot. You can choose to either cast that ballot OR decrypt it which spoils it but proves to you that it was faithfully encrypted (they don't know which you'll do in advance).  You can iterate this multiple times.\n\nBecause of this you can prove to someone that you voted, but can't prove which way.  There may be other ways to do that in Helios, -- I haven't reviewed the system extensively.  But a lot of people have reviewed it, and people working on voting systems have worked hard to work through these issues. It was fairly simple to go through the audit process, and there is an assumption that there can't be large scale fraud without getting caught if at least a few users are auditing it.\n\nBlockchains are the wrong tool for voting systems. The problems they solve are not generally the problems voting systems present, and the limitations blockchain systems have (like privacy and miners being able to block transactions) create critical weaknesses for voting systems.  The particular system in use is especially bad, with the software being changed on the fly out from under users, there is basically no assurance that it's doing anything in particular.  (and already it seems to be letting people vote for some candidates and not others-- e.g. the only candidate I can get to is Olivier Janssen the rest just show that the round isn't ready yet, so it's already biasing the election results just due to being buggy, even without any intentional fraud).\n\nBeyond all this, switching process without public discussion in the middle of an election sounds like the kind of thing that should happen more in poorly written implausible political-thriller fiction than in reality.": 3, '/u/untouchedURL, bruce_fenton wants to send you a Bitcoin tip for 4,174 bits ($1.00).

Systems like Helios already provide excellent transparency, auditability, privacy, etc. etc. and they don\'t need blockchains to do it. So when Bitcoin enthusists keep on suggesting "lets vote on the blockchain!!!!" naturally the crypto community rolls their eyes - the problems the Bitcoin people are trying to solve have already been solved.\n\n*Except* the ability to treat the right to vote as a token and transfer it around the blockchain securely. Usually though cryptographers have the opposite requirement - trying to prevent people from selling their vote for cash - so by tweeting "the only new thing the blockchain brings to voting tech is the ability to securely sell my vote" I\'m quite delibrately making fun of the Bitcoin enthusiasts pushing blockchain voting.\n\nAnyway, that the foundation is replacing the excellent and peer-reviewed Helios Voting system for the non-peer-reviewed Swarm scheme "because Bitcoin" is just stupid and strongly indicates the people in charge there don\'t understand cryptography.': 3, '[**@virtuallylaw**](https://twitter.com/virtuallylaw):\n>[2015-02-25 02:18:12 UTC](https://twitter.com/virtuallylaw/status/570407384893382656)\n\n>Blockchain voting... almost there... fingers crossed...\n\n----\n\n[^[Mistake?]](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=TweetPoster&subject=Error%20Report&message=http://reddit.com/2x2kmg%0A%0APlease leave above link unaltered.)\n[^[Suggestion]](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=TweetPoster&subject=Suggestion)\n[^[FAQ]](http://np.reddit.com/r/TweetPoster/comments/13relk/)\n[^[Code]](https://github.com/buttscicles/TweetPoster)\n[^[Issues]](https://github.com/buttscicles/TweetPoster/issues)\n': 1, "For background :\n\nPatrick Murck is the Executive Director of the Bitcoin Foundation.\n\nRight now there is a runoff election for the four leading candidates from the general election:\n\nBruce Fenton (me)\nOlivier Janssens\nJim Harper\nMichael Perklin\n\nThis election will elect two Board members to replace the two seats which will be open.\n\nI don't know anything else about Blockchain voting or what this announcement means other than his tweet.\n\nI know they had tried to launch this for the general election and am guessing that they had tech delays and are trying to launch it now.\n\n https://mobile.twitter.com/virtuallylaw/status/570407384893382656": 3, 'Here is a non-mobile link: https://twitter.com/virtuallylaw/status/570407384893382656\n \n^[Sourcecode](https://github.com/Kharms/untouchedURL) ^| ^[Feedback?](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=untouchedURL&amp;subject=untouchedURL%20feedback)': 2}, ('BTER.COM exchange tweeted CNY withdrawl ready', 3): {'[**@btercom**](https://twitter.com/btercom):\n>[2015-02-25 04:51:18 UTC](https://twitter.com/btercom/status/570445912910082048)\n\n>CNY withdrawal is ready now.\n\n----\n\n[^[Mistake?]](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=TweetPoster&subject=Error%20Report&message=http://reddit.com/2x2xdk%0A%0APlease leave above link unaltered.)\n[^[Suggestion]](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=TweetPoster&subject=Suggestion)\n[^[FAQ]](http://np.reddit.com/r/TweetPoster/comments/13relk/)\n[^[Code]](https://github.com/buttscicles/TweetPoster)\n[^[Issues]](https://github.com/buttscicles/TweetPoster/issues)\n': 1}}}
