For me, the take away is that the fact that there is a relationship between XBT price and global economic news like with Greece - even if inverse - is a sign that that XBT has arrived.

My intuition tells me the Greeks with more assets and wealth would be more likely to diversify into Bitcoin (though I also think it\'s foolish to purchase over 5% of net worth into Bitcoin; I even think 1-2% is pushing it).\n\nBut even if it\'s just 30 Million Euro over 3 months, we\'re talking about a very small market cap of $4B, with lots of HODLers. 3600 Bitcoins mined per day * 90 days * $300 per coin = $97 Million that the Bitcoin ecosystem would need to take in over a more or less constant rate over that timeframe.

Sure, next August when the US Mint gets resupplied you should be able to  buy Silver Eagles with the bogus value of $1 stamped on them, but no one would actually buy a one dollar item with a Silver Eagle because it's *value* is much higher than that and so they are never used in trade as money. Gold and silver have always been valued for their physical properties and that is why they always retain value. Historically gold and silver were valued because they could be used to create beautiful sculptures and jewelry and Gold especially is still highly prized for those attributes in India and most other places.

Just any lie is not enough?\n\nPonzi actually thought he could do something with international postage coupons that guaranteed profit and when he had investors clamoring to give him money, it was so easy to pay the earlier investors whom he had promised a return from the later investors. He *planned* to do the postage thing (which would not have worked due to limitations on the amount you could purchase) but meanwhile he did the only thing he could to "fulfill" his promises.\n\nUnlike Madoff, it is my impression that Ponzi was naive at first and then over-confident at the end.': 2, 'While "ponzi" has a rather narrow technical definition, it is popularly used for any investment instrument that does not create new concrete wealth (goods or services that customers can buy), but only moves money from new investors to earlier investors.  \n\nInvesting in bitcoin definitely has that character, since bitcoins do not create any concrete wealth.  (The bank fees that they occasionally save are worth less than the time and expense of learning and using the system.) \n\nThe only money coming into the bitcoin economy is provided by the new investors: people who acquire bitcoins to increase their holdings.  Part of that money goes to the miners (~1 million USD/day), part is the payoff of earlier investors who are reducing their holdings (an unknown amount, but probably of the same order or more), and a smaller part goes to various bitcoin-based companies, as service fees, spread, scams, mining and storage hardware, conference fees, etc..  \n\nIt is because of that net flow of money, from new investors to earlier investors who bought or mined bitcoins at much lower prices, that bitcoin is often called a "ponzi scheme" -- even if it is "not a *deliberate* ponzi", as some World Bank official once put it.  ': -1, 'I think the problem is you using bitcoin news and op-ed articles as "investment advice".': 0, "Yes, words are mutable but why not just call it a scam instead of the more specific Ponzi Scheme? BTW, you sound like someone who might enjoy reading the book by Mitch Zukoff Ponzi's Scheme. I think Zukoff was actually able to find people who had met him, like a niece or nephew. From this book I got the impression that Ponzi was basically an honest man lacking in sophistication, able to thrive in the 1920s when there was a lot of money and a lot of people interested in investing. (Indeed, this is a concern about Bitcoin -- I am a believer but maybe it has done so well for some of the same reasons the stock market in the 1920s has. Having said that, the difference is that the average Bitcoin holder is probably of above-average sophistication.)": 1, 'Most investments are typically characterized by dividends paid to earlier investments by later investors. If you invest in real estate hoping for a return, you are hoping someone later comes along and buys it at a higher price.\n\nThe thing that makes a Ponzi scheme a Ponzi scheme is the marketing and substance of the scheme. In a Ponzi scheme the new investments are used to pay dividends back to old investors immediately, but the Ponzi schemer typically lies and says the principle remains and the dividends are expansions from an external source. With Madoff\'s Ponzi he said he had a way to work the market to generate returns using client funds, he didn\'t say he was robbing Peter to pay Paul.\n\nWhat really characterizes a Ponzi then is the lying. Pretty much a good signal of a Ponzi is "guaranteed returns".\n\nBitcoin can be seen somewhat as a Ponzi from the perspective of people listening to people who misrepresent the truth and say Bitcoin offers guaranteed returns. Ponzi more broadly refers to any investment scam at all, so if people marketing Bitcoin as guaranteed returns who intend to sell at a higher price on the backs of the people who they are marketing to, that\'s a scam: pump and dump.': 3, 'Words are mutable, people just throw around Ponzi scheme to mean any old thing.

They justify this by postulating a top-down pyramid hypothesis, i.e. money will flow down from the top.\n\nThe alternative way of thinking is bottom-up.

But the current "orthodox" bitcoin miners would be unable to mine that chain too, so they would still be forced to upgrade to the the cartel\'s version an mine their chain.  \n\nThen there would be two cryptocoins calling themselves "bitcoin", incompatible with each other and with the old bitcoin: one with 350 petahash/second mining network, with a slightly different block reward schedule but still 21 million total issuance; and one mined by a few thousand CPUs, with the same block reward schedule, but a completely different hashing algorithm.  \n\nBoth coins will follow the same protocol, apart from those two differences.  Every client will initially have the same amounts of coin in both chains, in the same addresses, acessible with the same keys; but each client will be able to move and trade each altcoin independently after that.  *Note that even those clients who refuse to use the cartel\'s coin will have to upgrade their software to use the "new orthodox" coin.*\n\nSo, what percentage of clients will choose to work with one chain only, and dump the coins he has on the other? Which chain will the services prefer to serve?  Which of the two altcoins is likely to retain most of the value of the original bitcoin?  (Before replying, please try to guess how many bitcoin users know what a "block reward halving" is.)': 0, '> I think what /u/jstolfi is getting at is that a mining majority could 51% attack the original chain continuously to make it unusable. Users would migrate to whatever chain is usable out of desperation, possibly compromising principles in the process.\n\nExactly.  A mining majority can orphan all the blocks found by minority miners, and all other players are bound to use the majority\'s chain even if it has only empty blocks, or bogus transactions generated by the miners themselves.  (Rejecting the majority chain in favor of a minority one would mean discarding the very principle that is supposed to make bitcoin work.)\n\nHowever, I don\'t think there will be much "desperation".   Some cursing maybe, a few irredutible rebels; but, if the cartel uses a modicum of marketing and buys space on the bitcoin "news" sites, most users will just upgrade before the fork, just to avoid the hassle, and even speak out in favor of the change -- to preserve the value of the coin.\n\nSuppose the mining majority wanted to postpone the next halving by 2 years, and speed up the following ones so as to preserve the 21 million limit.  How many bitcoin users do you think would be upset about that?  My guess is 1000 or 2000 at most; 99% will not understand the change, and will not care to understand...

": 1, 'Unfortunately, a fork is a pretty big deal, and "just trying it" really isn\'t an option. In fact, one of the reasons people are against increasing the block size, is that it would cause a fork. That said, I\'m personally okay with a fork led by a super majority. Others think a super majority still isn\'t enough, and would require complete consensus to consider a fork.\n\nI should be more clear, just trying it isn\'t an option on the actual Bitcoin network, but it is an option on the Bitcoin testnet, which is just a version of Bitcoin with intentionally worthless tokens for the purpose of testing these sorts of things.\n\nAnother reason many people are against currently proposed block size increases, is that they believe everyone should be able to run a node, if the so choose, regardless of the hardware they have. Increasing the block size adds to the resources required to run a node, and will therefore force some people out of contributing to the network. A side effect of people no longer being able to run nodes, is increased centralization, which could be bad for Bitcoin.\n\nThere are probably other reasons as well, but I think those are the main ones. I am of the belief that not *everyone* needs to be able to run a node, and that it is more important that Bitcoin be scalable. Those against current block size increase proposals would argue that Bitcoin can be scaled in other ways, eg. the Lightning Network.\n\nProblems that I see with other scaling solutions:\n\n1. They don\'t exist (yet).\n2. They generally involve increasing centralization in some way.\n3. They still require some sort of increase to the block size  to actually be functional long term.\n\nI\'m probably missing a lot of things, but I think that\'s the gist of it.

Centralised off-chain transactions like Coinbase, and OpenTransactions have existed for years.\n\n> They generally involve increasing centralization in some way.\n\nFar better to have a centralised "layer 2" than force layer 1 to centralise. You can\'t build a decentralised system on top of a centralised blockchain. Lightning is still completely trustless, but *only* if everyone continues to run a full blockchain node themselves.\n\n> They still require some sort of increase to the block size to actually be functional long term.\n\nLong-term as in *decades later* - which is likely to be long after most people have access to sufficient resources to continue running a full node.': 2}, ("It's about trust", 0): {'https://bitrated.com is awesome trust network bitrated.com/homad is mine if you ever want to utilize me for escrow (Bobby Lee creator of Litecoin has an account) ...\n': 1}, ('Judge: Fraud case vs. Xapo CEO can proceed', 44): {'Same thing happened to Pied Piper.': 10, "isn't bitstamp using xapo?": 1, 'Remember the shady fake insurance they offer and the empty Swiss office.': -3, 'Yes, and a bunch of less technical large investors/suckers.

This is because a claimant (usually a plaintiff, sometimes a defendant making a counter claim) only needs to allege a legal claim in most cases to survive such a motion; whether the claim is true or not is a separate question.  Basically, a defendant making such a motion says, "I\'ll spot you factual allegations from the complaint; but, so what, no alleged facts in the complaint amount the legal conclusions you\'re raising."

It\xe2\x80\x99s as true as ever that imposing harsh austerity without debt relief is a doomed policy no matter how willing the country is to accept suffering. And this in turn means that even a complete Greek capitulation would be a dead end.\n\nCan Greece pull off a successful exit? Will Germany try to block a recovery? (Sorry, but that\xe2\x80\x99s the kind of thing we must now ask.)\n\nThe European project \xe2\x80\x94 a project I have always praised and supported \xe2\x80\x94 has just been dealt a terrible, perhaps fatal blow.

With a freeze on transfers of funds out of the country and a daily limit on how many euros Greeks can withdraw from the bank, there is a very real threat that countless Greek businesses will go bankrupt and Greece\xe2\x80\x99s people could become unable to buy the basic necessities of everyday life.\n\nFor the average Greek, getting one\xe2\x80\x99s hands on bitcoin requires buying it with euros\xe2\x80\x94the last thing any sane Greek would give up. That\xe2\x80\x99s why the bitcoin of today has no bearing on what could easily become a humanitarian crisis.\n\nBut Bitcoin is at an inflection point, and it\xe2\x80\x99s evolving much more quickly than all but its most dedicated observers realize. Whatever happens to bitcoin itself, the technology underlying it opens up previously unimagined possibilities for the future of just about anything humans exchange.\n\nYou don\xe2\x80\x99t have to take my word for it. Hardly a week goes by that a large institution doesn\xe2\x80\x99t announce its interest in bitcoin, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s the chief information officer at UBS saying it could lead to \xe2\x80\x9cmassive simplification\xe2\x80\x9d of banking, or the Bank of England declaring it will someday have \xe2\x80\x9cfar-reaching implications.\xe2\x80\x9d Deloitte recently issued a report on the potential for state-sponsored cryptocurrencies as an alternative to conventional money, and even Nasdaq is testing bitcoin technology for use on its stock exchange.\n\nYanis Varoufakis, Greece\xe2\x80\x99s former finance minister, proposed on his blog more than a year ago that if Greece wanted to create its own currency to replace the euro, it could use the technology of bitcoin to create a currency that he called \xe2\x80\x9cFuture Taxes\xe2\x80\x9d coin, the value of which would be guaranteed by future tax revenue taken in by the government.\n\nBitcoin is accepted world-wide. ENLARGE\nBitcoin is accepted world-wide. PHOTO: REUTERS\nIf the idea of Greece rapidly switching to an alternate currency seems ridiculous, consider that it is happening already. In Greece, companies are doing what they often do in times of currency crisis, which is paying suppliers and employees in IOUs, or scrip, which are promises to pay back a debt as soon as the banks unlock a firm\xe2\x80\x99s money.\n\nI asked Michael Casey, the senior adviser to the MIT Media Lab on cryptocurrencies\xe2\x80\x94and until recently, a reporter at The Wall Street Journal\xe2\x80\x94whether or not the technology underlying bitcoin, known as the blockchain, could be used to issue this scrip.\n\nAbsolutely, he assured me, and the mechanism might be a new technology called \xe2\x80\x9csidechains.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTo understand sidechains, it helps to know how bitcoin itself works. Broadly, transactions are recorded on a main digital ledger, called the blockchain, which is like any other account of transfers going back to the clay tablets that recorded pharaoh\xe2\x80\x99s stores of grain.\n\nBitcoin\xe2\x80\x99s ledger isn\xe2\x80\x99t processed or stored by one central body. Rather, it is distributed across a global network of computers, some of which are granted an economic incentive to keep the whole system running. Owing to this and other characteristics of bitcoin, no one on the system has to trust anyone else, neither a central transactional authority or the person sending them bitcoin, for the system to work. No third-party verification of the transfer of bitcoin takes place, nor is it needed. Not only is this system potentially faster than current forms of digital transactions, it could also be a lot cheaper.\n\nOn top of this basic protocol, there are a host of proposals to modify bitcoin to let anyone use it for pretty much any transaction, including signing contracts, issuing stock, and representing any kind of currency, from U.S. dollars to frequent-flier miles. Sidechains are arguably the leading contender among these proposals.\n\nBut that\xe2\x80\x99s just the start. Because bitcoin is becoming not a currency unto itself but a protocol, like the communications protocol that makes the Internet possible, as well as a platform, like Apple\xe2\x80\x99s app store, the kinds of transaction systems developers could build on top of it are limited only by our imaginations.\n\nOne idea, says Mr. Casey, is that Greece could create a \xe2\x80\x9ccollateralized currency\xe2\x80\x9d backed by state-owned assets. Cryptocoins representing a fraction of all the country\xe2\x80\x99s islands, ports and factories would hold their value as long as people believe the underlying assets do.\n\nThinking even further into the future, it isn\xe2\x80\x99t hard to imagine a way to use digital tokens to permanently institutionalize the last resort in all currency crises\xe2\x80\x94barter.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe reason why barter was flawed is you can\xe2\x80\x99t cut a horse in half in return for a bunch of arrowheads or whatever,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr. Casey. But crypto-tokens that individually represent a portion of an asset are infinitely divisible, he says, and \xe2\x80\x9cif you have infinitely divisible claims on an asset, then you could trade a third of a horse for a trip to Acapulco.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIf that sounds a lot like the abstraction known as money that is at the root of Greece\xe2\x80\x99s problems, you can appreciate that no technology can solve poor planning or badly designed systems. That said, the most exciting thing about bitcoin\xe2\x80\x99s blockchain technology is that it has the potential to democratize how money is created. And that, for many observers, is fundamentally what the debate over Greece and the fate of the entire European Union is about.': 257, "Greece has a lots of tourists coming in.

I would have preferred to have seen the existing BIP process utilized for this purpose so that the compromises can be worked out pre-propagation.\n\n>The rigorous infrastructure for code review and testing similar to the IETF is what Bitcoin protocol currently lacks and that's even more of a reason to reinforce the existing BIP process. It demonstrates code maturity. Yes, independent software propagation with time-released changes to hard fork the consensus chain should be there only as an absolute last resort.

Quite simply, if the majority of those running full nodes choose NOT to change their software, and if just one miner decides it\'s not in their best interests to raise the cap, Bitcoin will fork into two: original and new.

There are dozens of alt-coins, many of them straight-up Bitcoin forks. And yes, they muddy the waters somewhat, and yes the media can at times get confused.

But those of us who do not make the switch will continue to mine, propagate, validate and transact original bitcoins.

You can talk tough all you want, but when the chips are down and you find that 99% of your bitcoins worth has vanished due to a never ending series of fork-induced clusterfucks, and a multi-billion dollar media campaign to twist the knife in further, then you'll jump ship just like everybody else.

It would also have the benefit of being able to be tinkered with as the state would control the majority, if not all, of the hashpower on the network and have knowledge of at least some of the private keys. This is useful, for example, to reverse proven fraud, rescind a contract or engage in quantitative easing - arguably things any state needs to be able to do in order to maintain civilisation.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe cryptosterling that Byrne proposes has many of the philosophical qualities and underlying economic theories detested by some bitcoiners, but it also has the digital fluency qualities championed by others.': 1, 'Bitcoin can be a store of value without beeing used as currency on the base layer!

Now they have taken power, Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras. And then you have Spain right now. We recently spoke to Pablo Iglesias, the secretary general of the group called Podemos, that was founded, what\xe2\x80\x94an anti-austerity party that has rapidly gained popularity. A month after establishing itself last year, they won five seats in the European Parliament, and some polls show they could take the next election, which would mean that Pablo Iglesias, the 36-year-old political science professor and longtime activist, could possibly become the prime minister of Europe\xe2\x80\x99s fifth-largest economy. He came here to New York for just about 72 hours, and I asked him to talk about what austerity measures have meant in Spain.\n\nPABLO IGLESIAS: Austerity means that people is expulsed of their homes. Austerity means that the social services don\xe2\x80\x99t work anymore. Austerity means that public schools have not the elements, the means to develop their activity. Austerity means that the countries have not sovereignty anymore, and we became a colony of the financial powers and a colony of Germany. Austerity probably means the end of democracy. I think if we don\xe2\x80\x99t have democratic control of economy, we don\xe2\x80\x99t have democracy. It\xe2\x80\x99s impossible to separate economy and democracy, in my opinion.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: That was Pablo Iglesias, the head of this new anti-austerity group in Spain called Podemos, which means in English "We can." The significance of these movements?\n\nNOAM CHOMSKY: It\xe2\x80\x99s very significant. But notice the reaction. The reaction to Syriza was extremely savage. They made a little bit of progress in their negotiations, but not much. The Germans came down very hard on them.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: You mean in dealing with the debt.\n\nNOAM CHOMSKY: In the dealing with them, and sort of forced them to back off from almost all their proposals. What\xe2\x80\x99s going on with the austerity is really class war. As an economic program, austerity, under recession, makes no sense. It just makes the situation worse. So the Greek debt, relative to GDP, has actually gone up during the period of\xe2\x80\x94which is\xe2\x80\x94well, the policies that are supposed to overcome the debt. In the case of Spain, the debt was not a public debt, it was private debt. It was the actions of the banks. And that means also the German banks. Remember, when a bank makes a dangerous, a risky borrowing, somebody is making a risky lending. And the policies that are designed by the troika, you know, are basically paying off the banks, the perpetrators, much like here. The population is suffering. But one of the things that\xe2\x80\x99s happening is that the\xe2\x80\x94you know, the social democratic policies, so-called welfare state, is being eroded. That\xe2\x80\x99s class war. It\xe2\x80\x99s not an economic policy that makes any sense as to end a serious recession. And there is a reaction to it\xe2\x80\x94Greece, Spain and some in Ireland, growing elsewhere, France. But it\xe2\x80\x99s a very dangerous situation, could lead to a right-wing response, very right-wing. The alternative to Syriza might be Golden Dawn, neo-Nazi party.': 1, 'Makes it totally relevant as it proves the thesis that the first and last letter must be in place to understand whats being said.

But it could mean a great deal to those caught up in currency crises to come.\n\nGreece\xe2\x80\x99s fundamental problem is that it cannot work its way out of its financial hole the way just about every other country outside the eurozone would: by printing money, and in the process making its goods and labour cheaper.\n\nWith a freeze on transfers of funds out of the country and a daily limit on how many euros Greeks can withdraw from the bank, there is a very real threat that countless Greek businesses will go bankrupt and Greece\xe2\x80\x99s people could become unable to buy the basic necessities of everyday life.\n\nFor the average Greek, getting one\xe2\x80\x99s hands on bitcoin requires buying it with euros \xe2\x80\x94 the last thing any sane Greek would give up. That\xe2\x80\x99s why the bitcoin of today has no bearing on what could easily become a humanitarian crisis.\n\nBut bitcoin is at an inflection point, and it\xe2\x80\x99s evolving much more quickly than all but its most dedicated observers realise. Whatever happens to bitcoin itself, the technology underlying it opens up previously unimagined possibilities for the future of just about anything humans exchange.\n\nYou don\xe2\x80\x99t have to take my word for it. Hardly a week goes by that a large institution doesn\xe2\x80\x99t announce its interest in bitcoin, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s the chief information officer at UBS saying it could lead to \xe2\x80\x9cmassive simplification\xe2\x80\x9d of banking, or the Bank of England declaring it will someday have \xe2\x80\x9cfar-reaching implications\xe2\x80\x9d.\n\nDeloitte recently issued a report on the potential for state-sponsored cryptocurrencies as an alternative to conventional money, and even Nasdaq is testing bitcoin technology for use on its stock exchange.\n\nYanis Varoufakis, Greece\xe2\x80\x99s former finance minister, proposed on his blog more than a year ago that if Greece wanted to create its own currency to replace the euro, it could use the technology of bitcoin to create a currency that he called \xe2\x80\x9cFuture Taxes\xe2\x80\x9d coin, the value of which would be guaranteed by future tax revenue taken in by the government.\n\nIf the idea of Greece rapidly switching to an alternative currency seems ridiculous, consider that it is happening already. In Greece, companies are doing what they often do in times of currency crisis, which is paying suppliers and employees in IOUs, or scrip, which are promises to pay back a debt as soon as the banks unlock a firm\xe2\x80\x99s money.\n\nI asked Michael Casey, the senior adviser to the MIT Media Lab on cryptocurrencies \xe2\x80\x94 and until recently, a reporter at The Wall Street Journal \xe2\x80\x94 whether or not the technology underlying bitcoin, known as the blockchain, could be used to issue this scrip.\n\nAbsolutely, he assured me, and the mechanism might be a new technology called \xe2\x80\x9csidechains\xe2\x80\x9d.\n\nTo understand sidechains, it helps to know how bitcoin itself works. Broadly, transactions are recorded on a main digital ledger, called the blockchain, which is like any other account of transfers going back to the clay tablets that recorded pharaoh\xe2\x80\x99s stores of grain.\n\nBitcoin\xe2\x80\x99s ledger isn\xe2\x80\x99t processed or stored by one central body. Rather, it is distributed across a global network of computers, some of which are granted an economic incentive to keep the whole system running.\n\nOwing to this and other characteristics of bitcoin, no one on the system has to trust anyone else, neither a central transactional authority or the person sending them bitcoin, for the system to work.\n\nNo third-party verification of the transfer of bitcoin takes place, nor is it needed. Not only is this system potentially faster than current forms of digital transactions, it could also be a lot cheaper.\n\nOn top of this basic protocol, there are a host of proposals to modify bitcoin to let anyone use it for pretty much any transaction, including signing contracts, issuing stock, and representing any kind of currency, from US dollars to frequent-flyer miles. Sidechains are arguably the leading contender of these proposals.\n\nBut that\xe2\x80\x99s just the start. Because bitcoin is becoming not a currency unto itself but a protocol, like the communications protocol that makes the internet possible, as well as a platform, like Apple\xe2\x80\x99s app store, the kinds of transaction systems developers could build on top of it are limited only by our imaginations.\n\nOne idea, says Casey, is that Greece could create a \xe2\x80\x9ccollateralised currency\xe2\x80\x9d backed by state-owned assets. Cryptocoins representing a fraction of all the country\xe2\x80\x99s islands, ports and factories would hold their value as long as people believe the underlying assets do.\n\nThinking even further into the future, it isn\xe2\x80\x99t hard to imagine a way to use digital tokens to permanently institutionalise the last resort in currency crises \xe2\x80\x94 barter.\n\nThe most exciting thing about bitcoin\xe2\x80\x99s blockchain technology is that it has the potential to democratise how money is created. And that, for many observers, is fundamentally what the debate over Greece and the fate of the entire European Union is about.': 3, "I don't think I would a majority of the time, but I think I would do it occasionally when very interested in the subject matter.

Further, the founders have been involved in the Bitcoin community for a long time.\n\nHowever, even Vaultoro gives me doubts, since there is a default 0.5% trading fee each time you convert between bitcoin and gold (it easily adds up with every trade), a 0.4%/year gold storage fee (bitcoin has a 0% storage fee), and requesting delivery comes with its own set of rules and extra fees (smelting fee, and delivery fee) that are not transparently specified:\n> http://support.vaultoro.com/knowledgebase/articles/452230-how-to-get-physical-delivery-of-gold-i-own\n\nBasically, when you finally are done adding up all the fees with Vaultoro (which looks like the best bitcoin / gold option I\'ve seen so far), I would imagine it can add up to a lot.

Like those guys who seriously plan colonies on Mars or the terraforming of Venus.  On paper, skipping over an inconvenient details details, it may seems to work. But I have no evidence that they are anywhere near a design that actually can work.

And it seems to have many little usability problems, like having to keep your bitcoins locked in the system for months in order to get those claimed scalability features, and hubs having to borrow tons of bitcoins to set up their channels.\n\nConsidering that Adam & Co. do not see any problem in requiring bitcoin users to do "fee hopscotch" to get their transactions through the daily traffic jams, it is a good bet that their "overlay network" will be usable as an electric car that, instead of batteries, has a *very long* power cable connected to an outlet. \n\n> Can you clarify what you mean? Lightning is trustless, offers instant secure transactions \n\nIn the LN, payments will have to go through hubs.  In theory anyone coud set up a hub and any person can connect to any hub.  In practice, there will be perhaps two hubs licensed to operate in the US -- let\'s call them "Coinbase" and "Circle", for no particular reason -- who will of course require AML/KYC from any one who connects to them.  If you want to buy coffee at Starbucks, you will have to go through your hub Coinbase and then through Circle, because Starbucks will have only a channel to Circle, and will not bother to open additional channels just for you. If Coinbase, for some reason, thinks that you should not drink Starbucks coffee, they will just block your payment, and that will be it.  Hubs outside the US will refuse to serve clients in the US, you know why.  \n\n> and done with extremely low fees (able to allow true micropayments)\n\n... because the costs of running the hubs (servers, salaries, internet and electricity bills, insurance, marketing, debt interest, computer security, AML services...) will be entirely paid by their investors, day after day -- like bitcoin users have grown used to?

The hub.\n\n* How much? 2x the maximum size of a transaction in that particular channel.\n\n* For how long? For as long as the hub and the client want. When will the merchant get the bitcoins? When they close the channel. (Of course, the incentive is for funds to transfer instantly, so this is why funds will be unlocked instantly.)\n\nAnd, here\'s an example...\n\nSuppose a hub locks up 100 BTC. Then, say Alice sends 2 BTC to Bob via the hub. What happens?\n\nAlice creates a time-locked transaction paying the hub 2 BTC. The hub offers her a time-locked refund transaction returning her 2 BTC. The hub then offers Bob a time-locked transaction paying him 2 BTC. Bob tells Alice that he received the money. Alice allows the hub to: cancel its refund and accept the 2 BTC she paid the hub. The hub allows Bob to receive the 2 BTC it paid him. Now, Alice is 2 BTC poorer while Bob is 2 BTC richer, and the hub retains its starting amount of BTC.\n\n*disclaimer*: Lightning is great and all, but until it\'s ready for use, I still do agree we need a stopgap measure or \'bandaid\', such as an increase in block size to keep confirmation time and fees reasonable (low).': 4, "Not an ideological fan of Hearn, but this kind of discussion doesn't help.

I wish I could find the paper again, something about how, in a prison economy, good cigarettes get smoked, and the bad ones get used as money. People seem to reject a centralized decree that "Behold! This thing art now valuable!" by random parties. Governments get away with it because they\'re largely riding the coattails of what the society already converged on (gold coins), or they actually act with enough long-term integrity (connotation: predictability, rather than honesty necessarily) that they can unilaterally "move the market".': 1, "Isn't creating collectibles intentionally basically Supreme's business model(along with a lot of sneaker companies these days)?\n\nYou create a more valuable one by convincing a larger community of users to use it.

I think not.\n\nI think the following point, made by someone else, is extremely interesting: If by creating a new altcoin you can undermine BTC and presumably replace it with this new altcoin, doesn't this paradoxically make the new altcoin almost instantly of no value itself?\n\nSo I think maybe Bitcoin's value won't last but I don't think you can create a valuable one (without backing it by gold or something) out of thin air like Bitcoin's value was created; I think that was a unique historical event.": 1}, ('Rewind: U.S. Air Force will soon decide whether or not to commercialize "Bitcoin Snack Machine" and Payment Gateway [bet you can\'t eat just one]', 47): {'*Cuts out hat-sized sheet of tinfoil*': 1, 'Why?\n\nWhy is the Air Force in a position to be faced with this decision?!?': 1, 'In the protocol?

Trezor website claims that between the 19th and 20th try, it takes a week.\n\nWith Ledger if you try three bad PIN attempts, the devices wipes clean and you have to reseed it.\n\nThe one thing I like about Trezor over Ledger is that the PIN keypad is scrambled on the device.  Also, when you reseed your Trezor your are prompted to put in your seeds not in sequential order.  Enter seed three, enter seed fifteen, enter seed six, etc.  That's a pretty nice security feature if you're being keylogged.

You can still use these devices as wallets but for extra secure storage, each is an individual hardware signature device.  I don't use Coinkite login as a signature but as a way to create and access a multisig wallet.\n\nGood luck.\n": 7, "I've always wondered about that.

When you initialize that device, I believe you are asked to retype in the seed to confirm so again, you can be exposed to keylogging.  You can passphrase protect the device but that has to be typed in so again . . . keylogging.\n\nThe weakness of both Trezor and Ledger are the same to me: writing down and securing the twenty four word seed and not losing it.  After you seed the device, theoretically either can be used on a compromised computer.\n\nThe difference between the Nano and HW1 is completely cosmetic.\n\nOh, one more thing to consider, you can implement 2FA with your Ledger devices so there's that.  So even if someone steals your device and your PIN, they would also need your smartphone or security card (another roadblock) to authenticate.\n\nIt's apples and oranges.  If you can afford it, buy both and use one as primary.  The difficulty of cracking a 2-of-2 Ledger hardware signature with Coinkite as the interface is so remarkably hard that a hacker will find someone else to steal from rather than spend an enormous amount of time and effort to get mine.\n\nDo your due diligence.
