Bitcoin has proven that it will continue to scale on every metric, and includes the number of transactions that are happening on chain.\n\nPublic, decentralized blockchains are going to have value no matter what happens in the private space.  It seems that bitcoin has really already proved this is an accurate assumption.  So, consider that the value of assets being settled on a public decentralized blockchain really is predicated on the "value" of that blockchain.  The cost of securing that chain, helps determine the value that can be implied or secured on top of that chain.\n\nBitcoin needs to continue scaling.  There will be public and global usecases for settlement on the bitcoin blockchain, even if we aren\'t striving for VISA level transaction speed.  To support that type of activity, we clearly need to support additional transactions. There won\'t be any more growth in bitcoin if we stop the cart here.\n': 1, "Not hockey stick mass adoption, sure, but TX volume has been doubling year over year.

In it, he said releasing the report would help him show HSBC had systemic issues that led the bank to fumble its record-keeping duties in his mortgage dispute.\n\nOn the surface, the Moores\xe2\x80\x99 mortgage complaint would seem to have little to do with money laundering\xe2\x80\x94and Judge Gleeson has said the letter was just one among a flood of complaints about HSBC he has received from around the world. But for reasons he didn\xe2\x80\x99t explain, the judge decided to elevate the legal importance of Mr. Moore\xe2\x80\x99s letter. In late January, he shocked the banking industry by ordering the report released after saying the letter constituted a motion to unseal it.\n\nThe Moores sought to modify their HSBC-administered mortgage. ENLARGE\nThe Moores sought to modify their HSBC-administered mortgage. PHOTO: WILL FIGG FOR THE WALL STREET JOURNAL\nThe disclosure would be the first ever for this type of case and would shine a light on an increasingly common practice for banks accused of breaking the law. Instead of being prosecuted, banks typically enter into settlements under which they often agree to be overseen by monitors whose detailed judgments are kept secret. Judge Gleeson\xe2\x80\x99s order has the potential to dial back that confidentiality, opening a new channel of information that prosecutors say could threaten the viability of such settlements in future cases.\n\nHSBC and Justice Department prosecutors have opposed the release, saying it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do much to help Mr. Moore with his mortgage predicament. Judge Gleeson, in his order to unseal the report, said that was irrelevant.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Monitor\xe2\x80\x99s Report could have no useful information for Moore, and he\xe2\x80\x94as a member of the public\xe2\x80\x94would still have a right to see it,\xe2\x80\x9d the judge said.\n\nThe bank is appealing the ruling, but already it may be having an impact. HSBC disclosed last week that the January report by independent monitor Michael Cherkasky found instances of potential financial crime and had \xe2\x80\x9csignificant concerns\xe2\x80\x9d about the bank\xe2\x80\x99s pace of progress in complying with the money-laundering settlement.\n\nThe Moores say the experience has been surreal. The couple lives in this Philadelphia suburb with their four children, two dogs and a 15-year-old rabbit and had never spent much time in court other than for jury duty. They have nevertheless held their own against a phalanx of lawyers from the British bank and the Justice Department. A recent hearing in a Brooklyn federal court \xe2\x80\x9cwas like \xe2\x80\x98Law and Order,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Fletcher-Moore, who is 50 years old.\n\nThe Justice Department and HSBC declined to comment on the Moore family.\n\nHSBC admitted in its 2012 settlement that it failed to catch at least $881 million in drug-trafficking proceeds laundered through its U.S. bank and that its staff stripped data from transactions with Iran, Libya and Sudan to evade U.S. sanctions.\n\nThe Moores knew little of that when they first reached out for help with a financial squeeze. The couple said they had trouble keeping up with the $3,000-plus monthly mortgage payment on their $525,000 home after the cost of Mrs. Fletcher-Moore\xe2\x80\x99s treatment for breast cancer forced them to file for bankruptcy.\n\nThe mortgage was administered by HSBC, and the Moores say they wrote to the bank starting in 2008 asking it to temporarily lower the 7% interest rate. They said the lender appeared receptive, only for its representatives to misplace documents needed to complete their application for a loan modification several times.\n\nFrustrated, the Moores researched the bank online last year and stumbled upon news of the money-laundering settlement and the monitor\xe2\x80\x99s secret report. The Moores say they believe the report details faulty internal controls like those they encountered when trying to modify their loan.\n\nIn his letter to Judge Gleeson, Mr. Moore wrote that his experience trying to modify his mortgage led him to believe HSBC was violating the terms of a mortgage-related settlement and asked the judge to release the monitor\xe2\x80\x99s report to help him prove it.\n\nHis decision to consider the motion took the Moores from outside commentators to major participants in a federal case. The couple spent days researching the obscure cases the government and HSBC cited in their effort to keep the report secret.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Amodeo case was the real kicker for me,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Moore said, referring to United States vs. Amodeo, a suit involving a report similar to the monitor\xe2\x80\x99s on union-related corruption. The opposing side\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of the court case was \xe2\x80\x9cwhat we call in the lab cherry-picking the data,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\nThe Moores\xe2\x80\x99 motion came before the court in January. They drove to the hearing in Brooklyn in their black Mitsubishi. Mr. Moore, a 52-year-old sales director for a chemical company, rode shotgun, tweaking his legal arguments in a small notebook. The oral arguments lasted just under an hour. Later that month, Judge Gleeson ruled in the couple\xe2\x80\x99s favor.\n\nIf his ruling stands, it would be \xe2\x80\x9cthe first time we get to see what happens after a bank settles a prosecution,\xe2\x80\x9d said Brandon Garrett, a professor at University of Virginia\xe2\x80\x99s law school who has studied the monitor system.\n\nA ruling could eventually render other banks\xe2\x80\x99 reports public as well, he said. Credit Suisse Group AG and Standard Chartered PLC are among those also under monitoring arrangements.\n\nHSBC and the Justice Department are still fighting to keep the report private and have appealed Judge Gleeson\xe2\x80\x99s ruling to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals. An appeals court ruling could be months away. \xe2\x80\x9cI feel like a very small boat in a very large ocean,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Moore wrote at one point, in a letter responding to some of their arguments.\n\nWith the litigation grinding on, Mr. Moore stays up many nights to the early morning hours penning new letters to the court. Mrs. Fletcher-Moore edits them the next day for grammar\xe2\x80\x94a system the high-school sweethearts used when he was in graduate school.\n\nJudge Gleeson, who said Mr. Moore has done \xe2\x80\x9cadmirably\xe2\x80\x9d in court so far, recently suggested he retain David Schulz, a prominent First Amendment attorney who was willing to represent the couple for free.

The company believes that this is the largest trial on blockchain technology of a real-world process in the financial markets.\n\n12 Warning Signs An Investment Is A Scam\n\nThe size of the trial demonstrates that even as fintech, Bitcoin and blockchain startups threaten to dismantle Wall Street\xe2\x80\x99s grip on financial services, established players also intend to capitalize on technological innovation to make their products and services cheaper and faster \xe2\x80\x94 and could potentially do so quickly enough to ensure their future in what is likely to be a radically changed industry.\n\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s not the only effort by established financial institutions to exploit the efficiencies of shared ledger technology. In late December, Nasdaq\xe2\x80\x99s Linq product, which uses blockchain technology to manage shares in pre-IPO companies, recorded its first transaction, documenting the issuance of shares to a private investor.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis development further supports R3\xe2\x80\xb2s belief that close collaboration among global financial institutions and technology providers will create significant momentum behind the adoption of distributed ledger solutions across the industry,\xe2\x80\x9d David Rutter, R3\xe2\x80\x99s chief executive said in a statement. \xe2\x80\x9cThese technologies represent a new frontier of innovation and will dramatically improve the way the financial services industry operates, in much the same way as the advent of electronic trading decades ago delivered huge advancements in efficiency, transparency, scalability and security.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe group experimented with five distributed ledgers, provided by Chain, Eris Industries, Ethereum, IBM and Intel, all of which have developed such technologies either as open source projects or for enterprise.\n\nThe banks evaluated how well each technology ran smart contracts \xe2\x80\x94 computer programs that execute financial transactions \xe2\x80\x94 that helped issue, secondarily trade and redeem commercial paper, a type of fixed-income security corporations issue to raise short-term funds such as if they need capital to purchase inventory.\n\nThe distributed ledgers were hosted on cloud computing resources provided by Microsoft Azure, IBM Cloud and Amazon AWS.\n\nMember banks participating in this trial included Bank of America, Barclays, BBVA, Bank of New York Mellon, Citi, Deutsche Bank, JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs, HSBC, Morgan Stanley, State Street, Wells Fargo and others.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBlockchain is a powerful innovation that has the potential to create profound change in the way businesses interact,\xe2\x80\x9d said James Wallace, IBM\xe2\x80\x99s vice president of Blockchain, Global industries in a statement. \xe2\x80\x9cUsing IBM Blockchain services, a blockchain network was deployed within minutes, allowing the developers to rapidly focus on building a sample application for trading unsecured promissory notes within hours.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nWhile many observers of Bitcoin and blockchain technology say that a group with so many member institutions encumbered by bureaucracy is likely to be slow-moving, R3 has rather quickly experimented with new technologies. In January, 11 of its members, which included large financial institutions such as Barclays, Credit Suisse, HSBC and Wells Fargo, simulated the exchange of value on a distributed ledger (another term for blockchain technology) without using a central third party.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy undertaking initiatives such as this one, R3 is further accelerating the adoption of blockchain technology by demonstrating, instead of simply asserting, the commercial advantages of this emerging approach to financial services,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam Ludwin, CEO of Chain, in a statement.\n\nR3, in addition to gathering a consortium of banks that is developing blockchain standards and protocols, is working to create new software that can act as a standard communication layer that would allow different ledgers, such as Ethereum\xe2\x80\x99s public blockchain with Chain\xe2\x80\x99s private one, to interact with each other. The company also has a lab for its bank members to run controlled experiments on the technology, and down the line, it intends to also offer commercial applications that would, for instance, lower the costs of post-trade processing, settlement, payments and so on.': 1, 'Nothing is worth reading enough to disable my adblocker =[': 2}, ('Paid for reddit gold with bitcoin.

I understand the sentiment behind this but I think it has turned out to be dangerous - stagnating in fact.

If so, then increase the block size to keep the cost of storing the blockchain constant.

If we selected performance-based metrics then we would have had limits on the order of say 100kB or so and probably would still be well under 1MB today.\n\nThe problem is performance of Bitcoin exists on an S curve, not a smooth exponential. There was a long period of slow development. Then there was a period of massive real capacity increases from 2012-2016 as various scaling bottlenecks were removed through careful software engineering.

I like to run things in slow motion as it helps identify slow operations as it can get REALLY slow. it only has 4GB of RAM and that is probably what causes the slowness. When I say 3MB codesize, I forgot to say that by using memory mapped files for all the dataset it doesnt use any fixed system RAM, if the system needs it, it is just swapped out. If you have the RAM, it all stays in RAM, if not it will swap out, but I got through a sync with 3GB of RAM allocated to the buffers.\n\nI think what you say about downloading the blockchain in parallel is at the level of just copying the data. When I say parallel sync, I mean it is downloading things in parallel, building the data set and indexes, combining raw block files into bundle files, verifying the blockchain. All in parallel. Bandwidth is mostly maxxed out other than a few dropouts, but I have a solution in the works for that and CPU usage is about half the cores for the first part and then 90% toward the end.\n\nI am not claiming iguana is any replacement for the core, iguana doesnt mine any blocks.

The sigs are about the same size though at 15GB+, but i was thinking to do that in the background with a way for the user to see how much has been validated.
