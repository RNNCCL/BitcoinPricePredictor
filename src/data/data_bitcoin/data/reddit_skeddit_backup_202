Evidence would for instance be showing that for every 1000 new Bitcoin users there is one that will run a full node, and that the number of new Bitcoin users has to grow with a feasible amount to curb the trend.\n\nHowever the fraction of Bitcoiners running a full node will drop if adoption increases. This is because to attract a large number of new users, Bitcoin has to become easier to use so that also less tech savvy users can get started. But these new and less tech savvy Bitcoiners be less likely to run a full node. In other words - if mass adoption happens, it is likely that only a small fraction will be running a full node.\n\nTherefore I do not think mass adoption will significantly raise the number of nodes.

If you feel this unit has a lifespan of six months, then the $1,532 purchase price divided by six months is $8.51 in depreciation per-day.\n\nAdd the $8.51 depreciation plus $3.72 in electricity and you are at $12.23 -- in daily cost.  That's $1.61 above the revenue even.\n\nIf you amortize this over a longer period you have a lower per-day cost and maybe the difficulty rise won't continue at current pace allowing you to do that.\n\nNow if you are counting on the exchange rate rising to help offset the amortized cost, then why not just buy bitcoin and HODL?  \n\nNow here's the angle some people use to justify purchase of a miner.  If you are paying for heating and a miner offsets that heating, the cost of electricity to run this can be reduced by some amount.\n\nOthers get an income tax reduction from capital equipment purchases.

Like I have been saying for years, the 1 MB limit is a major obstacle to Bitcoin achieving any appreciable scale of adoption, because it is extremely difficult to change, and hurts investor/business confidence in the likelihood of rapid adoption occurring, which in turn becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy (less investment -> less adoption, aka "the Fidelity Effect").\n\nThe limit does not necessarily have to be widely supported either for it to remain unchanged. The Bitcoin protocol, by design, is difficult to change. It is like IP4: once everyone is using it, it becomes exceedingly difficult to update, since it requires a very difficult to coordinate simultaneous upgrade by the majority of the users in order to not cause chaos and damage.\n\nTo overcome the difficulties of doing a hard fork, the Bitcoin community and economy needs to coalesce around an informal governing structure of core developer, who implement a limit change and deploy it with the cooperation of a handful of gatekeepers in the Bitcoin economy that control critical junctions of communication within the community, like /r/bitcoin, Bitcointalk.org, and bitcoin.org.\n\nWhat this means is that as long as Bitcoin is dependent on hard forks to scale, a critical component of the protocol is relatively centralised, making the process of effecting a limit increase incompatible with a culture of permissionless-ness. This does not engender confidence.\n\nI get it, "Core devs representing over 90% of commits" don\'t want a permissive hard limit schedule implemented, as Szabo argues. But the purpose of Bitcoin wasn\'t to replace a political elite with a developer elite. Dependency on a very small developer community looks like centralization of power to the rest of the Bitcoin ecosystem. That does not engender confidence. That is why I don\'t support proposals like Adam Back\'s 2-4-8. They preserve this dependency on the developer minority for future growth in network usage, and thereby forestall the time when Bitcoin can be a truly decentralized protocol.\n\nIt\'s one thing to fall back on this de facto governance structure that are the developers in a crisis (e.g. a chain fork).

By non-standard I mean that nodes will not relay, mine, or show them unconfirmed in wallets; but accept them if they show up in a block. This means that the soft-fork can go through without risk that non-upgraded miners will inadvertently create blocks which are invalid under the soft-fork rules just because they don\'t know about the rule (unless they\'d been tinkering with their software in unsafe ways).\n\nIn the case of 113 the behavior being prohibited (transactions with nlocktime after the median-time-past) is currently treated as standard by Bitcoin Core. So it is preferable, though not strictly required, to suppress it on the network first before beginning the soft-fork.\n\nWhat is [BIP 113](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0113.mediawiki)?  BIP 113 changes the definition of time used in the network for the purpose of time based (as opposed to height based) nlocktime.  Nlocktime is a feature that lets the authors of transactions "post date" their transactions so that they are not good until a particular time (or height) as passed. However, Because Bitcoin is a distributed system there is no simple and natural definition of "time". What nlocktime used, historically, for the definition of time in time based locks is the time given in the block header of the block that mined it.\n\nThere is a somewhat severe economic incentive problem in the original design: If there are transactions paying fees which are not yet mine-able but will be soon, a miner can costlessly increase their income by nudging the time forward on their block and pick up those transactions early-- and without being obviously "evil". If there are many transactions using time based locktime and a few miners nudging their time, all miners who do not may end up operating at a loss. Once everyone is nudging users will compensate by adjusting their times forward and the cycle begins again. If that continues times may start bumping into the future time limit, and then centralized clock synchronization becomes very important or there will be pressure for miners to start relaxing that network rule. Either is not great.\n\nTo eliminate this, instead we plan to use "the median time of the last 11 blocks as of the last block" as the effective time (median time past, or MTP). This divorces the establishment of the time from the party that benefits from the time, so long as mining is sufficiently decentralized. A miner could still lie about their time, but it would have no effect at all unless enough hashpower lies, and to the extent that lying has an effect any benefit will be enjoyed by the the miners of later blocks, not the current one. This new rule means that time based locktime users will need to shift their locks earlier by about an hour to make them activate closer to the expected time, if they don\'t want a one hour bias. \n\nBecause the block time is already constrained by other rules to be greater than that number, using the MTP instead of the block time is a soft-fork: it strictly increases the strictness of the network rules. \n\nSome people find it surprising that the network would need time to decide what time it was, but this isn\'t something that unusual: E.g. If you want to know what time UTC an event happened with great accuracy, even if you have access to a national laboratory time standard you have to wait for the monthly BIPM [Circular-T](ftp://ftp2.bipm.org/pub/tai//publication/cirt/cirt.334) which has about 2 weeks of latency to tell you the consensus correction and uncertainty that applies to measurements from your reference time standard.\n\nWhy now?  We\'ve known about this incentives problem for a long time-- and this adjustment is just one of many understood improvements that could be made to Bitcoin time keeping--, but today nlocktime (esp time based) is not widely used. With the introduction of CLTV we expect nlocktime to become more common which would both mean more room for problems, more software that will have to be changed due to this, and more short term disincentives to making the behavior non-standard before the rule is enforced. Fortunately, 113 is a very small change, so its easier to make prophylactically.\n': 10}, ('Imogen Heap To Speak About Music And The Blockchain At Disrupt London', 17): {}, ('(Just a thought) Can we include Bitcoin in the SDR basket ?
