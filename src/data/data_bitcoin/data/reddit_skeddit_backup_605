Now imagine that you collect all these ca. 13.8 Mill price tags and calculate the average "bitcoin purchasing price tag". As long as this average price tag is much lower than the current market price (which is still the case today), there is a down-pressure of price because people tend to cash out. When prices fall, people panic-cash-out even more. But each time they cash out a bitcoin, this bitcoin\'s average purchasing price tag changes, so the averge price tag increases with time while btc market prices are falling.\n\nAt some point in time, the gap between average price tag and market price closes, people have no more reason to panic-sell, and also bitcoin wealth becomes more distributed amongst more people (people may cash-out when owning 100,000 USD in btc, but when owning only 10 or 100 USD in btc they simply forget about it and sit and wait - there is not a lot at stake, no reason to panic-cash-out).\n\nOnce we reach this point, down-pressure stops, new people continue buying but less "veterans" continue cashing-out, so price will stabilize and slowly increase again.

The python version has been just plain ugly.': 2, "Excellent question. \n\nJavascript has no constructs for dealing with concurrency, such as locks or thread-safe collections. As a result, you can really only use it for event-driven programming. This is fine for scripting a browser UI, but sometimes you just want to fill up all the eight cores of your machine with work without having to sandbox them in processes like some animal.\n\nJavascript uses dynamic/weak typing, which means the compiler has no information about types. This makes refactoring a _lot_ more difficult compared to Java or C#, where you can easily rename methods, encapsulate fields, move classes around or split them up, etc. etc. because the AST has type annotations. Sure Javascript allows you to develop fast in the beginning, but as soon as you reach the maintenance phase of your project, lack of refactoring tools really starts to hurt your productivity. This is one of the reasons people are so excited about TypeScript.\n\nThe Javascript Number type does not support integers. The kind of bit twiddling required for crypto is therefore difficult to implement. This also goes for the Bitcoin wire format. If you're doing a project where you really need to be compatible with all the corner cases and bugs in a C++ program, not having integer types kinda sucks.\n\nJavascript lacks the kind of features you need to write large-scale applications. It has no modules or namespaces, and lacks class-based OO (although some may say prototyping is superior). This makes it somewhat hard to manage a large collection of logically separable chunks of code. \n\nJavascript lacks a good class library. C++ has boost/stl, The JVM and .NET come with their own standardized set of collections, utilities, date classes, stream classes, I/O methods etc. etc. While all of this has been developed in the Javascript ecosystem, none of these are really standardized. This means that you have to piece together functionality from a set of libraries that never quite work well together because they themselves depend on a whole host of other things and may not even be using the same style of class-based OO, use the same naming conventions, etc.\n\nFinally, Javascript is slow as tits. Sure, V8 started a revolution in Javascript performance, but the JVM still runs circles around it. This is made worse by the way people program in Javascript, for example by having functions take many different types of parameters (e.g. a function can take either a number, string, or object, and still work) which means that V8 cannot do certain optimizations related to type inference (e.g. hidden classes). Whether you care about performance depends on your application, but since Bitcoin does a lot of CPU intensive stuff I'd say it's pretty relevant here. \n\nSure you can write anything you want in Javascript. You can write it in Python too, or Ruby. Or Java or Scala. Or C#, or TypeScript or Go. Or Haskell, or Clojure or F#. Each of these has pros and cons and most developers I know just pick whatever tool is best for the job.

The purpose of this was severalfold. First of all, I wanted to build the infrastructure for reddit's cryptofinancial system. This sounds a little bit ridiculous in hindsight because the new leadership is so uninterested in bitcoin that I think something like that is not going to happen for a long time.\n\nThe major application of that I was developing was the reddit wallet. You can see in fullnode that I had gotten as far as transaction building and validation in javascript, *including a script interpreter*, which is not exactly trivial if your goal is to make it completely compatible with bitcoin core. My code passes all the relevant script tests from bitcoin core so it at least comes close (although I do not recommend anybody rely on this code to run an actual full node - please don't yell at me, Peter Todd).\n\nThe reddit wallet, should it have existed, had absolutely enormous potential. The goal was to make it really easy for redditors to have and transact in digital assets, particularly bitcoin, dogecoin, and reddit notes, as well as any other assets using whatever protocol we ultimately used for reddit notes (probably colored coins or sidechains).\n\nConsider the implications of making p2p payments possible on the world's largest pseudonymous communication platform. It had the potential to play a large role in the global economy. It is a tragedy that this opportunity will now be missed (or at least substantially delayed).\n\nBesides simply enabling reddit's wallet, I also had a very deliberate strategy in developing what I did when I did and how I did. It needed to be open-source, both because I think that this was the best strategy for reddit and for bitcoin, and also because it was the best strategy for me personally. I figured the worst thing that could happen at reddit was that we could launch something and it would fail. What actually happened was that we launched nothing and I got fired. In only 4 months. This was worse than the worst outcome I thought was possible. Fortunately, I wrote a lot of highly relevant open-source software during my brief tenure so that any prospective employers, clients, or co-founders can see that at least I wasn't stagnating during this time.\n\nAlso, it was very educational to implement everything myself.\n\n> Ryan and Yishan were buddies\n\nUnfortunately, I am not friends with Yishan and have not been in touch with him since he left.
