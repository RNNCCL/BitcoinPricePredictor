The parallels with the Internet and Web with Bitcoin are very close. I remember the immense challenges in providing Internet services  - no server software, mass connectivity, PC software etc available - making it work and keeping it running on very slow modems. We had to write our own Windows software to give to people that enabled an Internet connection - Windows did not have it.\n\nI also remember that most users were technically competent enthusiasts who could hook up to the Internet at all.\n\nMany people told me that the Internet was a passing fad for geeks and nerds and would never take off because it served no purpose. That sounds familiar with what people say about Bitcoin.\n\nThe rest is history.\n\nBitcoin is following an almost identical but much faster trajectory.\n\nEverything that needs to happen is happening and happening fast, it is just a matter of reaching critical mass and crossing over in to the mainstream.\n\nIt will happen. When? I think we are looking at 3 to 5 years depending on many factors. When the global financial system inevitably implodes it will be a major catalyst for Bitcoin.\n\nIn the meantime price is irrelevant - it needs to find a base and equilibrium to move up from.

Amazon.com was the "world\'s largest bookstore," had successfully defended that claim in court, and had successfully issued its IPO. You could read tech news on HotWired (now Wired.com), opinion articles on Salon or recipes on Epicurious. You could listen to mp3s after downloading Winamp, you could check your web-based Hotmail account, and you could chat on ICQ. You could read the news on BBC News Online or the New York Times, or ESPN, or basically any other major media outlet. The Onion was online. Video gamers could visit IGN, Gamespot, Gamespy, and Gamasutra. In the conservative sphere, WorldNetDaily, Free Republic, Townhall, and the Drudge Report all existed. (Within a few months, Drudge would scoop every major news outlet on the Lewinsky affair). Meanwhile, Slashdot, Snopes.com, Boing Boing, eBay, Pitchfork, Craigslist, The Smoking Gun, Overstock.com, MSN, and more were all up and running, both "blog" and "meme" were words, and Google was less than a year away. Banner ads had successfully monetized the web. "Free" AOL CDs were being mailed to nearly every address in America, inserted in major magazines, and were even available at supermarket checkouts. \n\nOf course, even that\'s a poor comparison, since the first usable web *browser* was Mosaic in 1993, and six years after *that* it was 1999 and we were in the middle of the all-encompassing internet bubble.

Bitcoin is actively replacing massive vested interests and massive earlier investment in infrastructure.  At its absolute most successful level it\'s probably going to turn some of the largest and richest corporations into buggy whip manufacturers.\n\nIn short: even if we think of Bitcoin as merely an "application platform", that platform is so ingrained, so inherent in every single facet of modern life that comprehending the potential scale is close to impossible.\n\n> Is this a genuine request for a reasonable discussion or am I being ridiculous?\n\nThe reason I used the word "ridiculous" is because it demonstrates a lack of appreciation of the above.
