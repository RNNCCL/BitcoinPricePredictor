It isn\'t all "shiny"\n\nI got in with Hashlets early and I am close to ROI with my initial, and about 35 percent of re-invest. So far for me it has been a decent mining investment. I spread the love, I have some Zues, CEX, a couple of private contracts and more Ants than I need to heat my whole home throughout the cold as hell, central MN winter.\n\nDollar for Bitcoin the only thing more profitable then my hashlets for the past four months have been my Ants (@ 0.155KWh ECE). I will say, "all are real close in the running though".  Well until it got cold, then the Ants had a huge jump, (as heat is a waste by-product of mining).\n\nAll-in-all though, the "software miners" as I call them, are all really close, but again, my hashlet account, (at present), is on top of the pile for ROI and profit. I have invested about $3200,00 USD with GAW. So I am not that big of a player with them, I am a Bitmain Boy myself! \n\nConcerning Ponzi:\nI am an IT Engineer (POS), traveling the US doing IT installs for fortune 500 companies. A colleague of mine visiting from NY exclaimed, "hey, that dude was at one of those "Hanger Installs". Speaking of Josh Garza (GAW\'s CEO), when I was showing him a GAW conference video. \n\nIt was some months ago, my colleague called, "Ya it was weird, we were porting fiber off the freeway to an "airline type hanger" with empty shelves and nothing around it, barely a parking lot"? I know it is nothing to you all, but my colleague is a straight shooter and in my head I felt (as little as it was) that I had some kind of real world, inner circle confirmation that GAW was mining. \n\nMy colleague also said, when he gets back to the area he will try to find out what is inside "with a truly friendly telco visit". This was about six weeks ago. \n\nPlus I know someone at Bitmain that confirmed more than just the "online GAW/Bitmain order confirmation". Saying, "GAW was ordering way before that "online thing".\n\n Not many people interview personally with CNN to "publicize their Ponzi scheme either"? I personally know Frank and Donna Nuelan (scam-scamscamscam-scam!), Forest Lake, MN- Preacher/Ponzi Scheme...look it up. That\'s a focking Ponzi, 43bil that lead back to the London. Donna and her daughter lived with family members of mine for a brief spell before heading over seas, when Frank went to the slammer. One of my other family members had completely legal business with them (did not know who he was in business with...none of us did) and lost over a 1/4Mil! You want to talk War of the Roses.....\n\nConcerning Zen Pool:\nOverall decent, but a pain in the rear enough to add:\nWebsite is down due to maintenance, Wallet froze till further notice, (cause we Focked up again and people took advantage and we have to figure it out). We over paid, We undercharge, we overcharge, we underpaid.\n\nThen the super fun, log in to your account and 1/3 of your balance is gone, never to return, ever. Ya, sorry folks we have been overpaying you for a whole Focking month, looking like you was making some good BTC there....Invested more because of it....well phyc! It was over payment and we took it back........For me it took five days to get proof from GAW that the claim was valid. After seeing the ledger it was, but boy that sucked arse!\n\nShiny Fantasy Land HashTalk:\nFFFFOCKING HATE IT. All I can say is it is Focking Gay! Sorry, but it is. Not in the happy gay way. I mean the 6\'2" bearded biker on a pink Harley Gay!!!!! You know, you don\'t want to look, but damn you just have too. I hate it....CENSORSHIP UP THE....well that would be nice after the gay talk....but you get my point.\n\nI mean the CEO post some news and you have to go through 279,684 of my 12 year olds hand clapping animated gifs to see what someone really has to say, if someone actually says something. It\'s fockin\' scary! I\'m like seriously people, Really?\n\nI was biatching up a storm when they took a third of BTC, nothing that needed deleting or banning just saying how they went about it wrong and they need to provide a ledger. They Censored my post, made it look like I was off topic in my own thread and then locked it. The happy shiny feeling is edited right in the forum...\n\nI truly hate that I have to log into that twilight zone for announcements....that\'s another thing they don\'t email announcements, you have to focking log into shiny town.\n\nHASH POINTS:\nThey are an elect pool, you are no way forced to mine or collect them. There are several pools you can choose that pay BTC. I\'ve wondered a bit, "make up a damn point or coin and pay it to people instead of established crypto"? Let\'s hope it pays, for a couple of weeks that is about all I have been mining with ZenPool.\n\nThe whole Hash Point thing is over in a couple weeks, so it will be back to BTC, or PayCoin?\n\nPayCoin:\nAs I said, "IT Engineer: POS" (Point of Sale) 16 years and running. If you can pay or transfer any type of funds with it in the business world at POS, I\'ve had my hand on it in one way or another. Fock GAW, I have SOP, and COC, CW\'s of my own I have signed so I can not name names. With that, there are POS IT Dept\'s talking about PayCoin. \n\nThere have not been many, but they are a bit spread out in the industry, the speed compared to ACH was one thing I heard. Then BC Escrow for b2b, was another talk. To me it seemed a little more than just shop talk, why, as soon as I talked PayCoin there was a subtle hush. Nothing rude, just a gentle "steer the convo in a new direction" sort of thing. I have done TS work for the SSA, FBI, Norwest, Wells Fargo....I am familiar with that ever so politically correct, "you don\'t need to know" brush off and PC has that sort of feel in the POS world?\n\n\nEnd Notes:\nI don\'t think Josh hired anyone or had anything to do with the hack. It doesn\'t feel right....It\'s not a shiny focking thing to do...for real, through my ups and downs with GAW, the hack does not fit the profile. But one of those "happy clap animated gif" posters....oh ya! How dare you say the "happy clap God is lying"....and off they would go a happy clap hackin;" \n\nI will say this though, it kind feels like you are mining with the US Gov., Too much control, and the forum well.......\n\nBut with all that, I have had a lot worse investments and dealt with a whole shite load more crap to earn a buck. If the Hashpoint/Paycoin does what GAW claims it will ROI my initial (again), cause it is close to ROI now.....If not I lost a few weeks mining, not cool, but not the end of the world for me. \n\nFock the foil hat, I\'ll approach them with a full foil suit....lol. But approach I will.\n\nSo that\'s my GAW speeeeel. \n\nHappy Mining and When the Hell are S5\'s being released!\n': 1, 'This part had me in stiches:\n"Paycoin launches with more merchant acceptance than any other cryptocurrency in history."': 1, 'paging /u/coinfire code red!': 8, 'Just in case..CopyPasta\n\nRecently the CEO of GAW Miners claimed publicly that the company and he personally have sealed up partnerships and deals with Target, Amazon, and Walmart about the coin and the company.\n\nJosh also made a claim in an interview with CCN about Authy that they were single-handedly stress testing the Authy service because the requests are so high and outperforming other Authy users,\n\n>ZenCloud Now Sends More Requests to Authy (a 2 factor authentication service) than Coinbase and CEX!\n\n>And, it\xe2\x80\x99s all because of you guys.\n\nEarlier this week, Authy called us and said our users were stressing their network. Authy is an amazing company. Turns out ZenCloud users are pinging Authy for more 2FA requests than any other company in the space. Even more than CoinBase and CEX.io received communication from Authy.\n\nCoin Fire has learned these recent claims are stretching the truth or outright lies.\n\nAt the Hashers United Conference in Vegas Josh made the bold claims about Walmart, Target, and Amazon, and our news team immediately began working to confirm the claims. After several weeks of back and forth between the legal teams and public relations teams at one of the companies we have finally received four on-the-record statements and a bold statement from one of the four companies legal teams.\n\nWalmart confirmed via spokesperson Tara Greco that Walmart has no relation with GAW Miners, PayCoin or any project that Josh Garza or GAW Miners is involved with issuing the following statement to Coin Fire,\n\n>Walmart has no intention of expanding our current payment options to accept PayCoin from GAW Miners or any affiliate of the company. Any statements implying this is the case are false. Walmart offers a variety of payment methods in our stores and on our website for our customers which can be found online or in-store. We have no partnership with this company.\n\nTarget also confirmed to our team that much like Walmart it has no relation to paycoin, or GAW Miners with a spokesperson telling our editorial team,\n\n>Target does not have any record of any partnership with GAW Miners or anyone named Josh Garza. Any statement contrary to this is false. We have no intention of accepting \xe2\x80\x9cpaycoin\xe2\x80\x9d.\n\nAmazon went one step further with having an unnamed source at the company\xe2\x80\x99s legal department tell us that,\n\n>If this company believes it can imply a partnership with Amazon we will be seeing them in court if they don\xe2\x80\x99t stop doing so immediately.\n\nThe official statement from an Amazon spokesperson was just as telling if less bold reading,\n\n>Amazon is not affiliated or partnered with GAW Miners or paycoin. If this company wishes to list products on our website as a third-party seller they may do so. No partnership should be implied from those listings. Amazon has created a robust and international system that allows vendors to bring products to the Amazon.com website \xe2\x80\x93 but in no way does it imply a partnership with our company.\n\n>We also have no intentions of selling our merchandise through paycoin and refer our customers to the now accepted payment methods already on the Amazon site.\n\nWhile Josh is declaring publicly and implying a partnership with all three companies it would seem that all three are disavowing any sort of partnership. We have reached out to GAW Miners for a statement about these statements but once again the company has repeatedly denied our staff a statement.\n\nTwo members of the Authy team offered the following comments to Coin Fire about Josh\xe2\x80\x99s statements to CCN.\n\n>We do not comment on customer account volumes compared to other accounts.\n\n\xe2\x80\x94 Daniel Palacio, Founder of Authy, Inc.\n\nThis statement was followed up by a statement from the President and COO of the company, Marc Boroditsky:\n\n>First off, we don\xe2\x80\x99t comment on the specifics of our customers\xe2\x80\x99 use of our service.\n\n>Second, our service has not been and could not be stressed by the use generated by any single customer.\n\n>Third, ZenMiner use has genuinely increased in the past two months.\n\nSo while the company stated the use has genuinely increased it did offer comments that they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t give details to one client about performance versus other clients. To do so would likely cause a sticky situation for the company as Coinbase and GHash likely wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t take kindly to the remarks.\n\nAfter our site\xe2\x80\x99s previous concerns about GAW Miners and the company\xe2\x80\x99s failure to give a statement we immediately dropped all GAW Miners advertisements from our site.\n\nAs this feature went to editing a listing for Hashlet had gone live on Amazon. It should be noted though it is not being sold directly by Amazon but rather a third-party vendor. With the remarks from Josh Garza recently it would seem he is implying a direct partnership and this listing to the untrained eye would seem that way \xe2\x80\x94 but is not any sort of partnership with Amazon as a spokesperson had made clear to Coin Fire.\n\nCoin Fire has reached out multiple times for comments on this story and a response from GAW Miners before publishing this article. If Josh Garza and GAW Miners can give complete evidence that any of the companies he has before mentioned are entering a BONAFIDE partnership and said company is willing to go on the record we will update this story.

If the client deposited 10 coins in 2010, when the price was 5 dollars (say), he lost 50$.  AFAIK, the court will not try to give each client the *profits* that MtGOX  claimed he had made, namely the final account balance.  Moreover, since it was the client's decision to leave those 10 coins at MtGOX, the court will probably not consider the profit that he *could* have made if he had kept the coins in his wallet and sold them in 2013 for 10'000$.  \n\nBut, again, it is a waste of time to discuss what we think is fair or unfair.  You must check first what the laws and precedents say, and whether you have any options; and only a lawyer can tell you that.\n\nIt is very likely that there are laws that require the claims to be paid in yen, the legal currency in Japan.  There are also practical accounting reasons to do so, due to the highly variable price of bitcoins.  \n\nEven though there are no previous cases with bitcoins, there must be cases where people deposited some thing with highly variable price (say, Argentinian pesos, oil, soybeans) at different times, into a company that went bankrupt.  Such cases would be precedents for this one.  \n": 1, "I don't think they need to ask that.  That money was seized with the consent of Japanese authorities, presumably because it was connected to illegal activities. So, that money is gone, and the accounts that motivated the seizure will surely be excluded from the distribution.\n\nAnyway the trustee's primary job is to collect the assets that are left and distribute them to the creditors.  He will call the police to investigate the unexplained disappearance of assets (as he did already, but it is not clear for what assets) and other evidence of crimes (theft, embezzlement, management fraud etc.) that he may run into.\n\nI suppose that clients could also ask the Japanese authorities for a criminal investigation of the case, independently of the bankruptcy process.": 3, '> Is that "gox self-help group" being advised by a layer who understands Japanese bankruptcy law?

Apparently not, since otherwise that lawyer would have written the letter.\n\nThe group seems to think that the receiver can and must do whatever the former clients want him to do.  Do they know that there are laws and tons of legal precedents for how bankrupt companies are liquidated?\n\nThe first question that the group should ASK the liquidator is how the claims will be defined.  AFAIK, the standard practice in such cases (used, for example, in the Madoff ponzi liquidation) is to ignore the internal trades and fictitious balances of the company, and instead define the loss of each client as being the amount deposited minus the amount withdrawn, valuing bitcoins with the market price at the time of deposit or withdrawal.\n\nObviously, the claims computed by this method will be VERY different from the final account balances.   For example, if a client deposited 100 bitcoins in October 2013 (when the price was 120$/BTC), withdrew 5 bitcoins in November 2013 (price 1000$/BTC) and had 500 BTC in his account when MtGOX folded, by this criterion his claim would be 100 x 120 - 5 x 1000 = 7000$ -- **not** 500 BTC, **not** 95 BTC. It is not known whether this standard method will be used in MtGOX\'s case.\n\nThe alternative of using the final account balances as the claimable amounts, as the self-help group demands, has a lot of practical and legal problems.  One of them is that there may have been fraudulent trading or fictitious BTC deposits, or bitcoin purchases with non-existent money, leaving some "special" clients with overinflated account balances.  (That, by the way, is one possible explanation for the disappearance of the 660\'000 BTC: perhaps they never existed in the first place.) Thus, distributing the assets according to the final balances may only consummate the fraud.\n\nAll claimants will have to identify themselves and submit proof that they are the owners of their accounts.  Apparently some in the self-help group expect that the old anonymous accounts will be honored as such.\n\nAFAIK, the refunds will have to be in yen, with the remaining bitcoins being auctioned.  There are legal requirements (the yen is legal tender, bitcoin is not) and practical problems (clients who lost money due to the devaluation of the BTC since February will feel robbed).  Even if the bitcoins are distributed as bitcoins, they will be awarded proportionally to the validated claim amounts; which, as said above, may not be the final account balances.\n\n(I have tried to point out these issues to the self-help group in the bitcointalk forum, but they seem to think that the court and receiver are just part of the bitcoin planet, where there is no law and everyone does whatever he wants.)': 6, "You did not annoy me, only I think that you are wasting your time by not seeking legal counsel. \n\nThe method that I described is not *my* method, it is the method that (according to the little I know) is typically used in such cases.  So it is useless to discuss what would be the best method; you must first know whether there is a choice.\n\nWhenever the law does not specify what the judge should decide in some case, the judge will look for a precedent -- a case already closed that is sufficiently similar to the one in question -- and take the same decision.  That is why you need to consult a competent lawyer, who knows not only the law but the precedents that could fit MtGOX's bankruptcy.  There may be conflicting precedents, and then your lawyer will point out to the judge the ones that are favorable for you.\n\nThe 220'000 coins are indeed owed to the clients, but the question is how they are to be divided.  If one client deposited 10 BTC in 2011, and another one deposited 10 BTC in Nov/2013, do they deserve to get 10 BTC each?  The first one paid maybe 50$ for them, the second one may have paid 10'000$...\n\nIf the coins are to be auctioned, the trustee will take care of it.

If we start to treat Bitcoins unequal, then we open a Pandora's box. Such things make people very angry. When my Bitcoins from MtGox have a lower value than other Bitcoins from MtGox why the 220,000 Goxcoins should then have the same value as normal Bitcoins? \n\nSo when I get passed over I blacklist these coins and no longer accept them until they are not mixed in  homoeopathic doses with normal Bitcoins. That would be okay for me too. And if even more people do that I think it would have serious consequences. I do not think that there's a similar case, because Bitcoin is stateless money which makes it very different from other assets. People accept it voluntarily or not. There is no law that forces a market participants to accept a particular input. Nobody wants to get paid with its own Bitcoins. That's the normative force of the present state.

As it is, Bitcoin is fairly niche, so if it\'s only this little community who are tipping content creators for their work, things will only go so far.\n\nConversely, if Bitcoin is promoted in the process, there is a possibility the community grows, the sphere expands, and the revolution in online interactions begins to stand a real chance.\n\nIn other words, the Bitcoin community isn\'t big enough yet to financially back the microtransaction revolution with their tips. The only way such a thing could really take off would be if the community grows... so the primary function of the service is twofold, and your false dichotomy can be discarded.': 1, "The best example I can give is Youtube. The amount of money Youtubers now make per video view is tiny. It was bigger, it's been in decline because as Youtube put video ads in, more and more people have been using adblock, and as a result many popular Youtubers now rely on promotional deals to earn money (which leads to controversy sometimes).\n\nhttp://allthingsd.com/20130304/youtubes-show-me-the-money-problem/\n\n>The dollars programmers earn from YouTube\xe2\x80\x99s ad-selling efforts range widely. But many big publishers say that after YouTube takes its 45 percent cut of the ads it sells, they frequently end up keeping about $2.50 for every 1,000 views their clips generate \xe2\x80\x94 that is, if their video generates a million views, they get $2,500. Other publishers say their split can be as high as $10 per 1,000.\n\n$0.0025 per view is really damn tiny. If tipping took off, it would take 1 in 4 people tipping a single cent to match that. Would you pay a single cent for a video that you enjoyed? I certainly would, and I am willing to bet I'm not alone. I really believe the problem with online monetization has not been that people are unwilling to pay for what is free, but that they are unwilling to go through the process of paying via credit card or paypal for every little interaction they have with the web. Giving 1c, 10c or $1 for an awesome video could become as easy as clicking like and favourite is today.\n\nIf the average viewer just payed 1c, that would beat the revenue Youtube is doing overall. One in ten viewers paying 10c is not hard to imagine, if the video is good. I think the ratio could be much better than that in practice.\n\nThat leads to a further point. The video has to be good. I have to be glad I watched the video if I am to tip. If I have adblock, but I use tips, you only get money from me if I'm happy. If you made a sensationalist headline but the story didn't match? I'm sorry, no tip for me. The incentive structure has suddenly massively improved. Yes you can get me to click through your thumbnail with a cute girl displaying cleavage, but you won't profit from it.\n\nEverything I say here applies even more to online journalism than Youtube, but tipping exists on Youtube right now, and it may only take a handful of larger channels recognizing the extra revenue potential to start talking about it and promoting it.\n\nEdit: I misunderstood your original post, OP. Check out the stream of tips that followed Stephen Merchant's request for \xc2\xa31 birthday gifts. In general, no, a flood of tips is not something that happens often. Bitcoin tipping is still really really tiny! You won't see huge streams of tiny tips to the same person until:\n\n1. People widely see value in bitcoin\n2. It stops being noisy and spammy to do so (ie. it's cleanly integrated into site pages).": 6, "1. Not in one of those countries.\n2. I presently support Youtubers via Patreon, so your ad hominem doesn't even reflect reality. They take 10% off the top, and I don't like using Paypal, but it's the only way right now.\n3. Google Wallet charges fees similar to Paypal and is not good for microtransactions.": 7, "Just as a side note, I think that floods of tips are less likely to happen when the process is so public. If someone sees that a person has already received a large amount of tips, no matter how small the real amount, they'll be less likely to pile on their own tip. It's equivalent to seeing a panhandler with a cap full of twenty dollar bills - you're much less likely to throw him a buck or two, even though the rational approach would be to assume that he's making that kind of money, but simply taking the change out of his cap so it looks like he isn't. \n\nAnd it's not because people are bitter about the homeless guy getting twenty-five dollars. They're probably more upset that when they're fifteenth on the list of generous donors, less of the good feeling you get from tipping someone really belongs to them. It dilutes the glory, in other words. Because let's be honest here - most people give selflessly to make *themselves* feel good, and that's fine, because that's just what makes charity work. \n\nI suppose there's a value judgement the changetip community needs to make here. Is promoting bitcoin the primary function of the service, or is it distributing money to good internetting? If the former, keep on keeping on. But if the goal is really to revolutionize our online interactions via monetizing everything (a complex goal which really requires its own discussion) perhaps a super-public notification system isn't the way forward.

I\'ve tried a few times on here to explain that it\'s not about me personally, rather how people in general will react to a small tip. My idea is to tip enough for someone to actually use bitcoin to purchase something, even a trinket (think bitcoin sticker or keychain or something). Include the link to said item along with the tip and the person is more likely to go through the process of using bitcoins. That does more than one thing, but the best as far as adoption goes is that they will see bitcoin actually in use and a week or so later they will be holding something that someone on the internet gave them. That "does something" to a person, even if it\'s subconsciously. Everyone wants this to be the new world currency, but they are limiting it by getting excited over sending each other (already interested parties for the most part) $0.17 at a time.\n\nEntice people to actually use it over just giving them a virtual nickel that they can pass along to another person and so on and so forth. Mass adoption will only come when you all make people use it. This is only one idea and I don\'t care personally, but this type of thing is what it takes it to make people associate it with spending, or buying, however you want to see it.\n\nThe reason I say this is not because I want larger tips (I\'m happy with whatever), but if you all as a community/idea want mass adoption, it is better to tip larger. I think that is the disconnect here. One side says anything is good (those that are already interested and/or tipping actively) and then there is society in general and the "typical person" you need to get using it for greater adoption that won\'t care about a few pennies as a tip more than likely, however will gladly follow step by step directions to get something mailed to them for free.': 13, "For people who already understand Bitcoin and already use changetip small tips don't take any effort to collect and they add up.\n\nBut for someone who doesn't yet understand Bitcoin or use changetip there is a certain amount of time and effort required to learn about it and start using it.

Making a really awesome / funny comment and earning 50 bucks for it when 1000 people tip you an average of 5 cents would be pretty neat. The problem is that changetip is not currently that unobtrusive. Indiscriminate low-value tips can obnoxiously clutter a thread. And tipping is not yet ubiquitous. Your five cent tip is unlikely to be one of ten, let alone one of a thousand. In many cases, it will be the first and only tip someone has received and that amount of value won\'t do them a lot of good on its own. (Yes, it can give someone an opportunity to learn about bitcoin but if they haven\'t expressed an interest in bitcoin, it\'s going to rightfully be perceived as spammy.)
