Next year we\'ll amend the tax code and have Bitcoin taxed as a currency instead". And then, the taxes that long term holders pay when they sell will go up quite a bit. \n\nPoint is, the IRS is only concerned with tax collection. Decisions they make as to how different assets are taxed means nothing to other government agencies. And we don\'t want the IRS to change its mind on this. \n\nJust want to be clear on that. It doesn\'t help your case all. \n\nInstead, I\'d suggest bringing to NC\'s attention the "Bitcoin friendly states" and point out the potential jobs losses and shrinkage of the tax base if developers and interested users decided to leave NC as a result. Supposing you could find data to back up that sort of claim, that\'d be a whole lot more persuasive than citing the IRS\n\nAdditionally, the law looks like it tries to regulate Bitcoin processors rather than Bitcoin itself; to your last point, that wouldn\'t mean that they\'d have to regulate every crypto currency and if they forgot to include one, oops. It just regulates the processors, exchanges. So if there are no payment processors for XTZ coin, there\'s no one to regulate. \n\nI don\'t know. I think you should concentrate on the good (making NC a tech friendly environment who attract companies, spur job growth), whereas taking an aggressive stand would mean that they don\'t care to attract tech jobs. \n\nThe other angle, as it\'s presented right now, strikes me more ad a "no fair!" Type of approach...\n\nJust my unsolicited 2 satoshis': 7, 'But they also regulate it with "money transmitter" laws, they\'re already having it 10 different ways. \n\nNeed to hire more Federal employees!': 1, 'The bill would levy annual assessment fees on Bitcoin payments processors in North Carolina pursuant to the "Application fees and annual assessment" section at the [bottom of page 8](http://ncleg.net/Sessions/2015/Bills/House/PDF/H289v1.pdf#page=8).\n\nIf passed, Bitcoin processors would pay an annual fee of $5,000, as well as a fee based on the volume of their transactions. \n\nFor example, a Bitcoin processor (Coinbase, Bitpay, etc.) that transacts $400,000  in N.C. in one year would pay a fee of $5,000. The fee represents an overall transaction fee of 1.25% ((5,000/400,000)*100).\n\nedit: Worse still, the annual assessment would cause substantially more harm to small startups. For example, if a small startup transacts $20,000 in North Carolina, its annual assessment would still be $5,000, which would represent a **25%** fee paid by the processor. \n\nIt\'s important to keep in mind, just in general, that regulatory fees are passed onto consumers. \n\nThe blockchain was built to transact any amount of Bitcoin, whether it be valued at $1.25 or $4.8 million, for a low network fee. This bill fundamentally changes how fees are assessed on Bitcoin transactions run through payments processors.\n\nH289 turns Bitcoin transaction fees in N.C. from use fees to excise fees.\n\n': 2, 'Send them tons of faxes with petitions using https://www.bitcoinfax.net/': -1, 'Regulation/laws that will ban it or levy fees making it pointless.': -1, 'This will encourage brain bleed, I hope they are not this dumb in NC.': 1, 'voteno289 700 bits /u/changetip\nThx for that.

The same language found in IRS guidance is used in North Carolina's H289 -- thus indicating the state's wishes to define Bitcoin in the same manner as the Feds (as non-money).\n\nTherefore, the state of N.C. wants to have it both ways: define Bitcoin as non-money, but regulate Bitcoin processors as money transmitters.\n\nThere are other ways to regulate Bitcoin.

There are a few different kinds of nodes: \n\n* **SPV nodes** or "light wallets", which most bitcoin wallets are.  These monitor the bitcoin network for traffic related to their addresses and can broadcast bitcoin transactions.\n* **Full nodes**, which help out with verifying transactions as they contain a full copy of the blockchain.  Thus, full nodes have the job of relaying valid transactions to other nodes and filtering out invalid transactions by not relaying them.  Wallets which also function as a full node include Bitcoin Core and Armory.\n* **Miners** are full nodes that also produce blocks to get the mining reward.  These can be either mining pools or solo miners.\n\nSo the answer to your question is that your transaction is broadcast to all of these.  The SPV nodes ignore them unless they\'re related to the addresses the wallet controls.  The full nodes relay them to other nodes if valid, and ignore them if not.  The mining pools gather transactions into a "mempool" of valid transactions, repeatedly hashing this set of transactions to try and find a block header which has a certain number of zeros at the beginning.  Once this block header is found, the mining pool announces the new block to all of the nodes it\'s connected to.\n\n>When I make a transaction, does it get broadcast to the nodes and the minors then look to them to include in the next block?\n\nYes, mining pools have their own full nodes, so they see transactions as they come in.\n\n>How would a minor choose to leave out a transaction (is that a setting they control)?\n\nMiners can choose to include or leave out transactions a their discretion.  Most miners try to include as many valid transactions as possible, because the transaction fees for all the transactions in a block go directly to the miner who mined that block.  But some mining pools have been known to mine blocks with only a coinbase transaction (the transaction that creates new coins and sends them to the miner) and no other transactions.\n\n>How is a block \'found\' and confirmed by other minors so they all agree on the chain?\n\nAs described above, as soon as a miner finds a hash of all the transactions they\'d like to include, they can then broadcast the block to the nodes they\'re connected to.  It\'s then up to the nodes in the network to come to a consensus about whether the new block is valid.  There are lots of criteria for whether a new block is valid.  Here are some:\n\n* **[Block header](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Block_hashing_algorithm)**: Does it actually solves the mining puzzle?  The block header must point to the most recent block on the longest chain.  Does it?\n* **Block structure**: Is the block small enough (current limit is 1MB)?  Is the coinbase transaction first?  Does the structure of the block conform to expectations?\n* **Transactions**: Are they all valid?  When combined together, do they produce the Merkle root listed in the header?\n\nOnce miners have determined that a block is valid, they simply need to start working on the next block, in the chain, making sure the even newer block is pointing at the new block.  So, a new block is "confirmed" once an *even newer* block is created which points back at it.  That\'s it.\n\nHope that was helpful!': 1, 'The Bitcoin.it Wiki has a lot of good info.

Everyone can use bitcoins. Even sentient canines.": 3, '>When I make a transaction, does it get broadcast to the nodes and the minors then look to them to include in the next block?\n\nThe network consists of nodes - and only nodes. A node is an instance of a computer program that talks to other nodes. Bitcoin Core is the de facto standard node software. A node typically connects to between 8 and ~100 peers. A peer is just another node on the network.\n\nThe process of message passing is like a game of Telephone that allows one person to talk to more than two other people.\n\nWhen you "broadcast" a transaction, you\'re actually publishing it to a single node. That node relays the transaction to its peers. Those peers relay to their peers, and so on. The process is called *propagation*. Any node can filter any transaction it wants to, although many nodes use the Core defaults, which is to relay only "standard" transactions with sufficient relay fee or a valid fee waiver.\n\nSome nodes are connected to mining rigs. That\'s how a miner gets ahold of your transaction.\n\nMiners are 100% in charge of which transactions to filter from a block they generate. They can use any criteria they want up to and including the exclusion of all user transactions.': 7, 'He wanted to have it explained like he was 5.': 2, '>How is a block \'found\' and confirmed by other minors so they all agree on the chain?\n\nAn analogy for finding a block I personally like:\n\nThink of the miners each rolling a dice that has 1000 sides. Everybody is playing the same dice game.  The first miner to roll a multiple of 100 (i.e. 100, 200, 300, etc) has "found" a block. Everybody knows the rules of the game so when you roll a 600, you "broadcast" that dice roll and your block to everybody. Everybody will acknowledge because they all know 600 is a multiple of 100 and you found a solution first. You can\'t fake a roll without actually rolling because the other nodes will also be looking for "proof" which is to say, they will *need to see your actual roll* which you share with them to prove you rolled a 600.  Side note: This also explains why miners with more mining power find more blocks: because they can roll dice faster and thus get more chances at "winning".\n\nWhen any node sees your block, they check it. They check to make sure you didn\'t include anybody\'s transactions that were double spends or invalid, they check to see your block is sequenced *after* the block they already know was previous, they check your dice roll, to be sure you didn\'t cheat. If it all passes, your block now is the last one in the chain and this is independently acknowledged and verified by all... there is no judge deciding if you found a block, you must rely on the consensus of all other peers (nodes)...\n\nNow, the miners express their acceptance of your block by adding your block to the end of the chain on their node, and they start rolling dice to find the next block after yours. If for some reason you sent out an invalid block, it will fail the tests by other nodes and the other miners won\'t roll the dice for the next block after yours, but rather they will still be rolling dice for the block after the one before yours... to win your spot, and your block will eventually be discarded by the network: "orphaned".\n\nTranslations:\n\n* 1000 sided dice = all possible block hashes\n* everybody playing same game = everybody is "hashing" the same hash function, looking for the same winning pattern\n* winner is a multiple of 100 = block hash matches a pre-determined pattern.

The winning pattern is - over simplified - a certain number of leading 0s)\n* fake a dice roll = give a block hash of a winning pattern but fail to provide inputs to the hash function which yielded the winning pattern hash.\n* proof = your block contains a winning pattern hash.. and.. the inputs to the hash function actually do make the hash you provided, when verified by anybody else.': 6, 'magic': 0}, ('What Bitcoin debit card do you recommend?', 10): {"I don't understand the appeal of this.
