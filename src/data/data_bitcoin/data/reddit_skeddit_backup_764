When transactions have stopped permanently on the bitcoin network, the "exodus" happens and a hard fork on bitshares is introduced with a new genesis block that contains all bitcoins and that establishes a fixed conversion rate between bitcoins and bitshares that values the currently existing bitshares at 20% of the new bitcoin total. Bitshares owners will be incentivized by the instant 2000% return a 1 billion valuation would give them, bitcoin owners would be incentivized because the total amount of bitcoins will now go from 21 million to around 19.5 million bitcoins (and they would get all the features of bitshares, and end the wasteful mining inflation), miners will be incentivized by external reward blocks that reward those who move to support the exodus first with extra bitcoins in the new genesis block, and a large pool of extra capital that subsidizes further mining so that an approximate 150% ROI will be achieved for all current miners over the course of the next year, putting them all in the black before permanently reducing mining expenses to something dramatically lower.': 2, 'The product endorsed by the OP is poorly marketed and most likely will fail.

The difference is your gain (or loss).\n\nSo, say you bought 1 BTC on 22nd Sep 2014 for $400, and then today spent that 1 BTC buying something worth $430. You made $30 capital gains, which would be reported in your 1040 Schedule D. Since you owned the coin for less than a year, it is treated as income and so taxed at your normal rate.\n\nIf you had bought that coin in Sep 2013, it would be long-term capital gains, and still reportable but the tax rate is discounted rate between 0% to 20% depending on your other income.\n\nYou can ignore any gains less than $0.50 per transaction, since all figures are rounded to the nearest whole dollar on the tax forms.\n\nThere are really two approaches to tracking the original cost basis. First, use two wallets. One where you keep coins that you know you won't spend/sell for more than a year, and the other where you spend them more frequently. When spending from the latter you'll take an average of what's in there and always include it as short term gains.\n\nSecondly, use a service like ours, [https://bitcointaxes.info](https://bitcointaxes.info), where you can upload your trading history (as well as income/spending/mining in version 2 at [https://bitcoin.tax](https://bitcoin.tax) ) that can then work out the cost basis of all your coins and report the exact gain when you spend or sell anything.\n\nHope that's useful.\n": 1}, ('How to get $6 of bitcoin', 2): {'https://localbitcoins.com/ ?': 4, "Here's 100 bits for you to start with via /u/changetip": 2, 'Bitcoin ATM\n\nhttp://coinatmradar.com/': 4, "I've been able to buy as little as $5 worth using localbitcoins cash deposit:\n\nhttp://bitzuma.com/posts/the-secret-to-buying-bitcoin-with-cash/\n\nAlternatively, you may be close to a Kiosk:\n\nhttp://coinatmradar.com/": 2, 'Wheres the best place to convert doge to Bitcoin?
