About a month ago I saw [an article](http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/239622) about an entrepreneur who raised over $60,000 on Kickstarter pre-selling access ot his Udemy course called "How to make a freaking iPhone app." After reading about his story, I thought to myself, "what a great way to expose a more mainstream audience to bitcoin while giving them all the knowledge they need to have the best experience using it. I\'ll teach a Udemy course and pre-sell access on Kickstarter!" \n\nWell, Kickstarter didn\'t work out (you can read why [here](http://p2pconnects.us/2014/12/16/why-i-chose-indiegogo-over-kickstarter-to-crowdfund-byob/), it\'s a relevant story that in itself tells why bitcoin is awesome) but I did manage to setup an Indiegogo campaign, where I have so far raised over 10% of my $2000 goal. If r/bitcoin can help me hit $1000 in the next two days, I have a shot at getting on Indiegogo\'s "Trending" page, where a lot more people will see the campaign thus making it much more likely to be successful. \n\nIf you think the online course and companion e-book + zine is an effective outreach tool for bitcoin, please help me reach my goal and prove to the world that people want freedom via cool technology just as much as they want "to make a freaking iPhone app." Also, any feedback you have on how I can make the campaign page better is welcome and appreciated :) \n\nTL;DR please help me raise $1000 in the next two days so I can trend on Indiegogo, exposing a new audience to bitcoin and giving them the knowledge they need to "be their own bank."

This would be one more marketing avenue for bitcoin and bitcoin education, so contributors to the crowdfunding campaign not only receive a product but help promote bitcoin on mainstream platforms too. \n\n> I think if success is dependent on a "guide" for average joes we have no chance. \n\nBitcoin is new, and there are a lot of ways to do it wrong. I want to set people on the right track if they are going to try to use bitcoin to store value as opposed to just using it to build apps or tip people online.\n\n> Being your own bank doesn\'t have the same value proposition as learning how to make apps.

It is also frequently called fundamental value.\n\nSo this means for bitcoin to have intrinsic value, it would have to be an asset, and it would have to have fundamental value. Well, this brings us deeper into the rabbit hole. What\'s an asset, and what\'s fundamental value? An asset is something you control/own, and the reason for acquiring it is that you presume it will increase in value over time. And fundamental value is does the asset *work*? Is it useful? Do others see the value in how the asset works?\n\nWhen you ask these questions to yourself and come up with the answers, it\'s pretty clear to me that bitcoin does indeed have intrinsic value according to financial market definitions. Just because it\'s not exactly like any other asset that has ever existed doesn\'t mean its intrinsic value should be dismissed. Ignorance is the only explanation for why people argue bitcoin has no intrinsic value.\n\nValue is a matter of collective consciousness. The old philosophical saying, "if a tree falls in the forest and no one is around, does it make a sound?" applies. If no one is around to value something like gold, then does gold have value?\n\nThe funny thing is, in a dystopian future where artificial intelligence one day takes over and kills/enslaves all humans, bitcoin could very well have more value than gold to AI. Fully automated systems that perform work would be powered and governed by the flow of bitcoin.

On the stock market they are called value investors, and these investors are buy-&-hold guys, because they are happy with the yield of the asset they buy. True, it is very hard to calculate what a cheap bitcoin should be worth, because BTC doesn\'t have a yield.

The real sell pressure in this hypothetical transaction is the unspoken assumption that a bitcoiner is selling off part of *his* holdings to get the merchandise, and then not buying it back into their own personal stash.\n\nFor example, if a newb with no holdings wishes to use Bitcoin at Dell or M$ or Time, they have to buy it first and *then* the merchant sells it.

Is that a fair characterization?": 1, "> It is still considered an experiment!\n\nAnd it is. The more one starts to dig into the code and logic, there are various small-but-significant issues to keep working on. There's the 1M limit for transactions blocks; there's the issue about whether it's safe to be re-using addresses, and thus improving the payment protocol / its adoptions. There's getting trustworthy and reliable exchanges and improving them. Right now each has one flaw or another (in my never humble opinion) and they're all rather young.\n\nAnd on and on.\n\nI'm a huge fan. I think none of this issues are insurmountable. But there *are* a lot of issues yet and it *is* still < V1 in core.\n\nSo, yeah, it's not really a top priority yet when people are choosing safe places to store value. I choose to speculate on it, but that's because I already know that I've got my basics somewhat covered, so I can afford to lose all of this.\n\nThere's a reason the sane advice is to not put anything into BTC that you can't afford to lose. It's a gamble.\n\nNow, in the 5-20 years when it *might* become dominant, then these issues should all be very much smoothed down to where it can become a safe and reliable way to store value (or at least reliably store BTC even if prices are still somewhat volatile). We're not there yet.": 2, "The optimisations I refer to are about preventing that from happening.\n\nThe reason why larger blocks are needed for any further major increase in adoption is obvious. You can't have anything close to mainstream adoption with only 1 MB of transaction data every 10 minutes.

If I have to guess, this price is $250 or below.* \n\nIt's not the absolute price than determines the attractiveness of an investment purchase. It's the expected percentage change in the purchase price after your purchase. If the price was at 1 cent, you could probably, as you say 'suck up' all the newly mined coins, but if two weeks later people are only willing to pay half a cent per bitcoin, well then shit, you've effectively lost half your money.\n\nThe same is true no matter the price $1 $.5, $100 $50, etc. you can divide a number and infinite amount of times.\n\n|*I'm buying all the way down, because that is the only safe strategy I can come up with.* \n\nHow in the world is that safe? Safe in the fact that if the price ever goes higher than it currently is, you will have bought for a lower price? Though probably unlikely, there's no guarantee that the price will ever be higher than it currently is, you're taking a non-negligible risk of losing money, I'm not sure 'safe' is the right word. Of course, virtually all investments come with risk, but to describe an investment that is riskier than many, as safe...\n\n|*Bitcoin price is controlled by psychology*\n\nIf you want to talk about psychology, I think there are at least two things to consider. If something has an outlandish price even momentarily, that can hold an undue weight in people's reasoning about it's relative value, a kind of anchoring effect.\n\n\nSecond, just because an investment asset has fallen precipitously in price doesn't mean people are going to rush in to buy it. Investment managers don't generally go around scooping up stocks at 52wk lows. I imagine most people's thinking goes, if it's fallen this far, there is probably a reason why and who is to say it won't fall further, and unless I have convincing, not widely known knowledge that that price has fallen too far, I'm going to trust what the market has decided.\n\nOf course, you also have people aware of the fact that markets are prone to exaggerated movements in both directions who will take a risk of buying something at a relatively low price even if they don't have strong evidence that the price 'should' be higher. People buying goxbux last spring for example.\n": 1, 'Fucken wizards. Always messing with the stock markets. \n\nThey should take their pipe-weed elsewhere. ': 2, "I'm all for side chains.

With modern computing speeds and the ever declining cost of bandwidth, there's no reason why the block size limit can't be raised to 10 MB after spent transaction pruning and IBLT are implemented, and then made to track a metric that gradually rises over time, at roughly the same rate as technology progresses.\n\n": 1, 'We had a stable level around $100 before the Gox bot started to go crazy.

The little people are back to using trusted third parties?\n\nExtreme decentralization is great, but only if people are able to make use of the blockchain. 420 transactions per minute for a global population of 7 billion is insufficient. It would mean the vast majority of the human population would never do a transaction on the block chain. If Bitcoin is going to be relevant, it without a doubt needs to raise the block size limit to allow more people to directly participate in the network. The costs of running a full node with transaction volumes of even 100 MB a block would still permit thousands to run full nodes, which is a wide enough distribution for Bitcoin to remain censor-proof.': 1, "Yes, this doesn't get mentioned enough.
