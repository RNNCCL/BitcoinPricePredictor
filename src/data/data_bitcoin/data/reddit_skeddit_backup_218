Bitcoin-NG increases the maximum tps, and effectively the blocksize (via "microblocks").\n\nThere are a few arguments against increasing the blocksize by a lot (BIP101). One being that big miners with good connections could be at an advantage. While another miner is trying to slowly push their solution, a big miner could theoretically upload their big block faster.\n\nBitcoin-NG solves this by keeping a keyblock with a small size and no txs stored in it.

This works quite well because this block is only accepted if all transactions are valid, i.e. no doublespends, etc.  This ensures that miners only include valid transactions, otherwise they would lose out on the mining reward (the coinbase and the txn fees).\n\nWhat this aims to do is have the proof-of-work happen much the same way, but to separate out the txn stuff so that the proof-of-work can be quickly broadcast and verified.  This is an important issue, as large blocks take more time to broadcast, which incentivizes mining centralization (how much is debatable and all that, but that is the tendency).\n\nHow do you do that?  You can give the miner control of validating txns for the next ~10 minutes until the next block.  This presents a problem though: there's nothing to stop the miner from including double-spends and other invalid transactions, at least until the next 'key' block (perhaps? not clear).  The authors propose a 'check' on this by being able to retroactively cancel miner rewards (~~I'm unclear how this works, it's a very important detail~~ miners have to wait 100 blocks to transact already, something I did not know.  5% of the reward goes to the 'poisoner', and the rest are permanently lost (deflation?)), thus incentivizing miners to correctly verify that micro/transaction-blocks are valid transactions.  Presumably any invalid transactions will be eliminated somehow as well.  I get the impression that this would occur at the next 'key' block, but the article doesn't mention how this would occur.\n\nFrom their blog post:\n\n> Double-spend attacks by malicious miners are obviously a key concern.

It's such a radical departure from Bitcoin, though, that it would be incredible to see it integrated.

Thank you for your so detailed answer. I think it's the most relevant post I've read from the beginning of my searches": 1, "After reading his interview with the FT yesterday. I created an account on MMM global and tried to see what the process was to make a deposit. Unfortunately, he doesn't host wallets. he lets users provide their own deposit addresses.\nQuite an interesting site overall. Scary nonetheless.": 1, "From what I understand is people are paying people directly through wire transfers and the use of bitcoin. So he doesn't directly touch any of the money being circulated around. ": 2, 'The scheme is pretty cleverly orchestrated on multiple levels. The members don\'t have to transfer any bitcoin to MMM itself. They only transfer funds directly to other participants. In this way all participants hold bitcoin in their own wallet and all participants have created accounts with OKCoin, Huobi etc. (these two primarily).\nWhat the MMM backend keeps track of is who should transfer what to whom and when. This is done through an internal accountancy unit called Mavros.\nIm not 1000% sure how it works in detail but the basic jist is somewhat like this:\n\n1. You register and in some way indicate how much you are willing to participate with. \n\n2. A "help" request is sent to you. A help request is basically someone else caching out. Say a user wants to cash out $1000 then this sum is split up and multiple users are asked to fund the cashout. Your share of this cashout might be $100. You then have 24 hours to transfer the bitcoin to his account. If you fail to do so your account in MMM will be closed and you will not be able to re-join.\n\n3. If you actually send the bitcoin the system will see the transaction in the blockchain. This will credit your account with Mavros. The Mavros grow by 100% every month. Its the amount of Mavros in your account that determines how much "help" you can ask for at a later point in time.\n\n4. If you enlist people you get 10% of their Mavros added to your Mavros. This stacks multiple layers downwards so the more people you get under you in the pyramid the more "help" you can ask for.\n\n5. There is also something called "guidance bonus". Im not entirely sure how the mechanism for this works but its obviously connected to getting more members in.\n\nBecause of the way its rigged its very difficult to estimate the size of MMM. If you ask them they have 4 million users globally and 500k in China. It might be crazy high or it might be low, there are incentives to both state small and large numbers.\n\nWhat i can say is that there is a _substantial_ amount of people drawn into this thing. If you go to youtube and search for "mmm pays" you will get 50k+ results and they all seem to be exactly what they claim. That means that 50k people have requested "help" from the system and gotten it. I cant see any reason to doubt the contents of these movies, many of them screencapture the backend of MMM showing the bitcoin transactions. You dont have to look at many videos before someone actually clicks the transaction so you can see the transaction ID. Ive checked several of these myself, its all in the blockchain.\nAll of these 50k have in some way earned a lot of Mavros to be able to make big withdrawals. Since the nature of the pyramid only credits Mavros after a bitcoin transaction under you has actually happened its safe to say that all of these 50k have a lot of people beneath them. Although most of the videos are in chinese you can still hear them say things like "10 manager", "100 manager", "1k manager" and "10k manager". That means they have 10,100,1000,10000 people beneath themselves in the pyramid.\n\nIf you youtube a thing like "mmm event". You get to see evidence of widespread recruitment. In schools, churches, community houses, stages. There are rallies in every which form. In a lot of these rallies you will se the Bitcoin logo on posters etc.\n\nThere are two branches of the scheme, MMM global and MMM China. MMM global is bitcoin only. MMM China is both bitcoin and RMB.\n\nIts also difficult to asses size based on traffic on the official MMM sites. Because managers whants to recruit people that are under them in the hierarchy they create their own MMM websites and facebook groups. If you start googling / facebooking a bit you will find hundreds of facebook pages and webpages in local language with a few hundred / thousand followers. So it really flies beneath the radar in every which way. I think the structure is cleverly engineered so that:\n\n1. Its difficult to estimate size.\n2. There is no link between the banking system and MMM\n3. There is no central webpage or facebook page\n4. The users hold their own funds, no centralization\n5. Its completely non-transparent that the people who request "help" are actual members and not the founders.\n\nIf its as big as it seems to be its beyond doubt influencing the price and demand of bitcoin in some way.': 2}, ('$360!', 15): {'[deleted]': 1, '\n\n    Address: 1e7HpXjSjBuJ1To3NRmeqBng1jpF8ceKe\n    Balance: 0.29110581 btc\n    Number of transactions: 12\n    Total sent: 0.00000000 btc\n    Total received: 0.29110581 btc\n\n\n^View ^on ^block ^explorers:\n\n^^*[Blockchain.info](https://blockchain.info/address/1e7HpXjSjBuJ1To3NRmeqBng1jpF8ceKe)* ^^**|** ^^*[BlockTrail.com](https://blocktrail.com/BTC/address/1e7HpXjSjBuJ1To3NRmeqBng1jpF8ceKe)* ^^**|** ^^*[Blockr.io](https://btc.blockr.io/address/info/1e7HpXjSjBuJ1To3NRmeqBng1jpF8ceKe)* ^^**|** *^^[Biteasy.com](https://www.biteasy.com/blockchain/addresses/1e7HpXjSjBuJ1To3NRmeqBng1jpF8ceKe)* ^^**|** ^^*[BitPay.com](https://insight.bitpay.com/address/1e7HpXjSjBuJ1To3NRmeqBng1jpF8ceKe)* ^^**|** ^^*[Smartbit.com.au](https://www.smartbit.com.au/address/1e7HpXjSjBuJ1To3NRmeqBng1jpF8ceKe)* ^^**|** ^^*[Blockonomics.co](https://www.blockonomics.co/#/search?q=1e7HpXjSjBuJ1To3NRmeqBng1jpF8ceKe)*\n\n*****\n\n^^I ^^am ^^a ^^bot. **[^^My ^^commands](http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3an2c4/ive_been_working_on_a_bot_for_crypto_subs_like/)** ^^| ^^*/r/crypto_bot* ^^| [^^Message ^^my ^^creator](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=busterroni)': 2, 'That doesn\'t make the movement artificial or fake it.

By paying miners a $230 subsidy on top the $100 market price -- (i.e., paying well more than the $300 price of XT), miners would be given an incentive to abandon Bitcoin-XT and go back to the original chain.   One block every 40 minutes means 900 BTC per-day mined on the original chain.  Multiply the $230 subsidy means ~$207,000 / day (initially) is the cost to make it economically profitable for miners to leave / abandon Bitcoin-XT.

An exchange that sees the attack underway isn't going to let you cash out your funds, even if you successfully got to do a trade.\n\nMore so, every hash on the big block side matters in the crucial beginning.  If there is any indication that attrition (losing out to the original chain) occurs introduces risk of the big blocks side of the fork failing to maintain the lead (which it must do otherwise the big blocks side will disappear from a block reorg).

I\'m certainly not suggesting that bitcoin core devs aren\'t involved, but I wonder how much is really testing and developing, and how much is IRC chats. When someone is employed at 4 or 5 places... you can see how it might be difficult to make a substantive contribution to some of those commitments. Even more important is conflicts of interest, which appear to be rife in core, on both sides of the blocksize debate.\n\n>Why do you think someone that contributes to Bitcoin Core has to do it 100% of his time, or a certain amount of commits per month? I\'m sure if you go and pay Peter for working on Bitcoin Core we will do even more work. And do you think Bitcoin developers don\'t have to eat? **What\'s your purpose with this topic?**\n\nAbsolutely agreed! The point of the topic is **governance**. Similar to running nodes, how can we incentivize code development? We can\'t rely on charitable giving to fund full time devs, any funding sources would likely generate a conflict of interest, and the only semi-rational idea is to simply "horse" devs who signed on to buy bitcoins to incentivize bitcoin development. Which is obviously a horrible idea. \n\nWe\'ve reached a point where bitcoin has essentially automated the manual operations of monetary policy, which is fabulous, but the "governance problem" of monetary policy is unsolved. The bitcoin dev team is analogous to the federal reserve, but even less efficient in that respect. Essentially, bitcoin ha automated the taylor rule - that\'s great. But we\'ve made no progress on how those rules are actually made. The similarities are concerning. \n\nThe US fed has a "dual mandate," that is, to manage both employment and inflation of the US. However, other models exist - the ECB is only mandated to manage inflation. This is quite comparable to the payment vs. settlement layer currently happening in bitcoin - what is the actual purpose of the dollar? **How do we decide** what the actual purpose of bitcoin, and the euro, and sidechains, and monero etc. is, which guides their development? It\'s a political issue.\n\nTL;DR: who decides what bitcoin\'s mandate is? This is a governance issue. I have no answer - I am inclined to think it would be one of decentralization - certainly centralization and politics is not the answer.': 2, "https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commits?author=petertodd\n\nI don't think this is almost nothing.

Alongside Mike H, Peter is one of the 2-3 people most frequently cited as difficult to work with, by other businesses and community members.  When asked about this, I typically relate an example from my previous decade of Linux kernel work:\n\nIn Linux (and now bitcoin), there are often very sharp individuals who make valuable contributions to the software - but whose attitude is often negative and unproductive when it comes to ideas/features the person does not understand or like.\n\nWe had a real problem in Linux with "jerks" scaring away other engineers.  Whole companies in Japan avoided directly contributing to Linux due the acerbic, hostile atmosphere.

Viacoin is a Bitcoin Core fork, so of course Todd wrote it such that it would apply to Core as well. What Viacoin got out of it was CLTV live on their network long before it was even merged into Core. What Bitcoin got out of it was a feature that has been battle-tested on an altcoin.': 13, '> Can you explain this dynamic? To me at least, it doesn\'t make sense, logically. A lot of criticism is also directed at you because of "Viacoin", so it would be good to clear it all up.\n\nViacoin has mostly the same codebase as Bitcoin Core, so work done on Core gets ported to Viacoin very quickly. Equally, some stuff - like CLTV - got ported to Viacoin prior to getting merged into Bitcoin.\n\nI was also going to work on treechains, but soon realised that I needed to do a lot more work on applications for it first, which later became my Proofchains concept. I managed to get a different client to pay for that work, so in the end Viacoin didn\'t pay for any treechains development.\n\nAs for debunking it, "meh" - those who push such memes are probably best ignored for trolling.\n\n> Maybe you should also start a blog on svbtle like Gavin, so you can post occasionally on important topics (such as this Viacoin meme).\n\nYeah, I keep meaning to do that.

At times you have to understand Peter\'s sense of humour.  It helps to see his facial expression as he\'s poking someone (smirking) as it sometimes doesnt translate.  Probably he\'s improving also 5 years is a long time.  \n\nAlso bitcoin is a meritocracy, and the age range is immense - some behaviour is learned by experience.  And some of us never learn either :) \n\nTips for being functional in high noise environments and not contributing to signal loss dynamics: focus on the tech, ignore the barbs, forgive, work-with people, dont hold grudges, be a positive example, dont retaliate etc.  For example online mailing-list & forum interactions of the late Hal Finney - never saw him once get angry in a decade of online discussions, including cypherpunks flame-fests and USENET etc polite and hyper focussed on the constructive and technical challenge.\n\n(Present company excluded): some people need to develop thicker skins too probably, it\'s often surprising how the same person can be happy to dish it out but fragile on the receiving end.

Can't wait to see CLTV and RBF live on the network.\n\n/u/changetip 1 beer private\n": 17, 'As well as more like you guys.': 2, '> but viacoin really rubs me the wrong way.\n\nIt may also be of interest how Viacoin fits into this picture. Firstly, since Viacoin is based on Bitcoin Core it is a downstream project from Bitcoin Core. That means, anything that goes into Bitcoin may also end up in Viacoin. The fact remains that Bitcoin Core is the most active project with the most expertise and peer review in the cryptocurrency ecosystem.\n\nOverall, my goal with Viacoin was to contribute positively to the ecosystem and that even if my project was not successful, that it would have a legacy that was useful for the world at large. The invention of bitcoin is an incredibly important invention for humanity and I want to see the technology develop and succeed.\n\nThis being the case, Peter and I agreed that it makes no sense to develop features in a vacuum because this stuff is hard and takes a long time to mature. Even if the target was for Viacoin (and in the example of CLTV, it was first deployed in Viacoin in January 2015), it makes sense that the BIPs and development work go on upstream with the aim of filtering back down. This ensures several criterion are met: that work is well peer reviewed and where possible contributions end up in Bitcoin Core and benefit everyone. If something is included in Bitcoin it must have been considered a good thing and is well peer reviewed and tested. Viacoin will benefit downstream: but the reverse is not true, something developed exclusively for Viacoin will never have the same level of quality.\n\nAll things being equal, if the feature/fix is merged to Bitcoin Core, that\'s a win for the Bitcoin ecosystem and for Viacoin which will get the feature downstream. If the feature is considered a bad idea as revealed by peer review, it stops a bad idea. If the idea is good but too radical for Bitcoin (which is hard to change because of it\'s size due to risks, or osification), then Viacoin is still at liberty to make the feature itself because Viacoin is much smaller. There almost no ossification and a lot less risks.\n\nPeter is his own man, guided by his own lights. To be clear his principals about Bitcoin override everything. So I let him get on with Bitcoin Core work he wanted but didnt necessarily have time to do without being paid since paid consulting takes priority. I say this because it\'s not possible to have a conflict of interest with Peter involved, he will never do something he doesn\'t believe in and want to do in the first place.\n\nI would like to comment about "number of commits". It may not be apparent to readers who are not directly involved in Bitcoin development, but writing code may actually be the least time consuming part of development. The amount of time required to even tests a patch cannot be underestimated. It can take a long time to get things right, and it may take a long time for reviewers to find problems. Unlike most other projects, it is incredible easy to introduce consensus bugs or introduce attack vectors with incredible consequences. Consensus systems really are difficult and code review, testing and security reviews are extremely time consuming. Even when one writes a patch, especially consensus or policy code it is very time consuming to do all the ancillary work of writing BIPs, discussion and championing the pull request and competing for reviewers (yes, literally there is competition to get stuff reviewed because there are so many patches and things going on).\n\nSince all this blocksize debacle, I have also become very involved in Bitcoin Core helping where I can especially in the area of scalability, code review and testing. I can vouch it is entirely possible to spend weeks on end with very little material to show. It\'s just the nature of the work.\n\nSo whether you like or hate Viacoin, CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY for example, was materialsed because of it. That is to say, without paying Peter it is very unlikely the necessary work would have done the work on materialising CLTV and it would not have been deployed in Bitcoin today. I take no credit for CLTV, it is an invention of Peter Todd and Greg Maxwell, but I did provide the oil to make it happen. CLTV was deployed (enforced) in Viacoin in January 2015 and we\'re about to begin deployment in Bitcoin Core. CLTV is widely anticipated by service provider developers (wallets, micropayment channels, lightning network), and I\'ve affectionally nicknamed it OP_HODL. RBF is another big contribution which has seen several iterations. That means a lot of code, and as yet still unmerged, although it seems likely this will be added soon.\n\nOverall, Peter is an incredibly valuable asset to the Bitcoin community. There are very few people with the kind of deep understanding and attention to detail. It has been a privilege working with him.\n': 7, "Aren't non-competes invalid everywhere if they prevent you from working in such a general sense?\n\nWhy would you have agreed to that, btw?

I wonder that it might be possible for two 33% selfish miners to leech reward from the rest of the network composed of smaller miners.  The other thing is we know 51% mining is a fundamental threshold so the practical relevance of selfish-mining is relating to the centralisation of pools and miners where we really do have pools > 25 or 33%.  We might be able to do something about that with tech (GBT like pooling protocols) and with education for power users and businesses to make it easier to not do that, and to encourage them to decentralise the hashrate by eg ecosystem companies running a bit of ASIC power, like say 1x SP50 would make a reasonable hash-rate contribution for presumably a not huge outlay.\n\nAnother simple thing with selfish-mining involving pools, to the extent the users are not complicit, is the client should broadcast the winning block (not leave it to the pool).\n\nIBLT would be good.  I do wonder about IBLT though on a couple of fronts: it's a homegenizing force sort of acting like a weak incentive to follow group-think censorship (if you add transactions that no one else has, your blocks will sync slower), and also it is an average case, the pathological case for it is to fill the block with transactions others dont have (eg pay to self).  Also one would like a relaying tech which is a level playing field, otherwise smaller miners will cluster on fast relay connected pools and let the pool choose the block.  That seems like a hard-problem as simple centralised things (like the way people are using Matt's relay network) will tend to win over p2p due to hop-count and lack of manually chosen and sourced links (Matt has curated them and sourced VPS's in unusual places to get access to routes that dont naturally happen via BGP).": 3, 'I will do when I will have enough to get my head into it.\n\nI get that other at are high orphan risk when you are two blocks ahead (well it is obvious..)

Do enough buying, you can contract directly with the fabs. It\'s all a straight forward process. Where exactly does the "diseconomy" kick in?\n\nIn hindsight, I think Bitcoin would have been much better served by thinking out an algorithm that MIGHT have changed kept this at bay. Something to keep it from getting etched in silicon, whether it\'s  alterations on the SHA2 hashing itself (SHA2-256, SHA-128, SHA-512, alternating), or even shifting proofs of work altogether (for blocks 1-X, SHA256, blocks X-Y, XXXXX), etc. \n\nI got interested in Bitcoin back when anyone could mine.

(well no, I didn\'t, but when I was CPU mining, I was getting payouts of 0.03 or so BTC, but Bitcoin was only worth single digits so it didn\'t seem worth it).\n\nThat said, even though Bitcoin hopes to be a trustless currency, I currently have trust in the miners more or less.

Many point to storage requirements. Sure, that could be true, but the fact of the matter is that I only ever ran a full node because I HAD to. Once an option opened up (in my case Electrum), I moved to that. I suspect that\'s the biggest driver of the decline in nodes, people never wanting to be a part of the network, especially once mining slipped out of reach of regular people.

I think there are some uses to Bitcoin that make it useful, so long as we can trust the big players (whether it\'s miners, node operators or developers). I don\'t think its possible to build a system that relies on trusting nobody - a few dishonest players ruin things, just as a few bad apples ruin the basket.

If you say "give me x-bitcoins", for $20.00 in goods, you are "buying $20.00 worth of BTC from them, in exchange for $20.00 of goods." You owe taxes on $20.00 worth of income.

In 2010, I learned about Bitcoin, and in January of 2014 I founded bitFlyer hoping to provide liquidity to the Bitcoin market in Japan. \n\nThis startup began in a bakery, where our CTO and Co-Founder, Takafumi Komiyama, and I would spend all day coding.

But later, as governments began to support it some time around 2013... that made it real currency to me. Bitcoin changes the world capital flow.

': 1, 'A few months ago when I had money stuck in igot, the one thing that always made me feel better was reading this post I found on bitcointalk, dated 17 December 2014, from DaBeagle: (https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=395675.120)\n\nI haven\'t done that many trades with Igot, especially as they made me jump through hoops to get my account authorised, which I feel was for their enjoyment. Even though I am a professional currency and precious metals dealer who trades in the millions each month and runs several successful companies, I was treated like an idiot. Maybe I was an idiot for pursuing Igot for an account in the first place. But I thought it was a change of pace and an interesting new concept. But I was told so many lies, and such utter crap that left me thinking, these guys are not going to last. Every question I emailed, which by the way takes an average of 12 hours to get an answer, are  returned with nothing to do with the original question, and strangely they are all by the same person. My imagination pictures them in a broken down seedy office with two people amongst milk crates for desks no phones and a couple of old rusty Pentiums.\n\nI know that sounds harsh but their customer service draws that visual image. Unless I\'m a special case, and actually for everyone else\xe2\x80\x99s sake  I really hope so, but I think most are treated like myself. I have read some horrible reviews on them, but know some people like to carry on. But seriously if I see a positive one, I\'m pretty sure its Julie (or whatever name she likes to use) hashing them out.\n\nSo in the past they have lost my deposits, lost my transfers, frozen my account for no reason and even after I had proof the money was in their account, they denied it. Unfortunately just before Julie sent me the same "We don\'t have it, its normal to take 10-20 days to do a bank transfer", and also the only reason I know someone else works there, I received an email saying my funds were cleared (5 days after they actually cleared their account). But still denial from Julie that they don\'t have it.\nBut as I am a glutton for punishment, and really like to see these amateurs fumble around grandstanding there performance, I did another transfer today, Having to email them as normal, warning them its coming or they won\'t find it for a week. I am told "oh, we changed that account 4 days ago" I should have checked with them before I sent, "Now that\'s your fault, try and get it back from the bank yourself". I rechecked my emails, nothing about any changes in their system ,although what kind of works there one day, isn\'t there for long. I looked at the deposit page like she said a notice was placed. Still nothing. Perhaps it only flashed up there for a minute, usual IGOT style. I explained although my last name is St.James I can\'t read their minds. If they don\'t inform their customers of change how the hell is anybody to know.. But all I get "Not our problem"..\nIt wasn\'t much, only $3k, but these cowboys are going to tarnish the industry, which will lead to more legislation and heavy handed rules making a new and fresh market impossible to work with. The government can\xe2\x80\x99t wait to shut this down, all they need is a good excuse, and people getting swindled losing their life savings are what headlines are made from.\n\nSo please walk away Rick Day, pack up your bongos before you ruin it for everyone. If one customers experience is 60 out of 60 trades a complete battle and nightmare, your obviously not capable of running a fish and chip shop in Australia let alone anything in the financial industry. I have basically been told by your staff (Julie, and the other guy by proxy) I have lost my 3 grand. Oh well\xe2\x80\xa6..\nTomorrow I will release 200k to my legal team to take everything, including those shiny bongo\'s. And if it needs another 200k so be it.\n\nI\'m sure going to be happy resting my feet on your milk crate desk.\n\n\nOh and I didn\'t want to give you that one star, but its the minimum.
