I am not running a betting site, so all of this might be stupid. But just so you can understand how I would go about this.\n\nFirst, I split sites into content types. Content types are not different than each other. Text is text, for the most part, but if you categorize content, you can really build a site using sort of weird silos that iwll allow you to interconnect everything. Also, if you schema mark it up, you can do some reall amazing things with content.\n\nFor a betting site, you make your money on bets placed. So you obviously want that behavior. So you need a content type where people convert into betters. Getting someone to make a bet is the same as Alarm Grid getting someone to purchase a security system.\n\nIf you do a quick keyword search on these sports events, you will very quickly see that the highest search term has to do with tickets to sporting events. \n\nWhere am I seeing this?\n\nGood question. I used [Google\'s keyword planner](https://adwords.google.com/ko/KeywordPlanner/Home?__u=4285798570&__c=2878558390&authuser=0).\n\nSo I am seeing a lot of keywords for tickets. So X vs Y tickets tend to be a very common search. These search terms are interesting because they are ephemeral. They come and go, which means that almost any site can compete for them if they do it right. So I would make a ticket content type.\n\nI would make a versus content type (this is quasi-evergreen for a lot of sports where the teams do not change from year to year). These I would make landing pages that pull in tickets having to do with the X vs Y games for the season. For one-offs like the pacquiao/mayweather fight, i\'d make the page, add the ticket, and then pretty it up so that you could compete on the P vs M tickets keyword. The META title would be "X vs Y tickets [year]" and I\'d have it dynamically change the year each season (unless there was some reason to have one setup for each year for historical traffic. I\'d have a bunch of content (not copied) about the history of these two teams matching up, and why it\'s important. Then I\'d list the tickets. I\'d also have a call to action button that says, "bet on X vs Y." I might even give people a little flake to start betting with like centsports did just to encourage signups.\n\nThose odds comparison tables, I would definitely not group them by sports. I would group them by matchups. Odds comparison tables, by the way, should be another content type. That way you can include them in places like a blog post, or on these pages, or on other spots on the site. For the page with teh odds comparison table itself, I might title the pages "X vs Y odds." I would have a landing page for the betting on each game as well entitled "bet on x vs y." On this page I would have a call to action that lets them bet. I would include the odds content type in some ways, I\'d have tons of content around analyzing who to bet on. I\'d produce articles for each bet like, "why you should bet on Pacquiao in his Fight against Mayweather" and similarly something along the lines of (but not exactly) "why you should bet on Mayweather in his Fight against Pacquiao."\n\nI\'d also then do videos on the content, build up a celebrity sports guy that will tell you what he thinks will happen in the fight.\n\nTHere\'s more, but that\'s enough for now. The reason people dont\' succeed when they build sites is because the amount of work in getting these up is inordinate. THink about it, I\'m basically telling you to do about 10,000 pieces of content over the next month. That\'s nuts. Content is hard, expensive, and the ROI isn\'t always there.': 2, "Those are some kind words. It doesn't really benefit me at all.

The way that i usually setup my analytics is I have an unfiltered profile, and then one wherein I enact a lot of filters. I want one where I can capture all the information. In the other profile, I can play and manipulate data so it shows what I want and what I don't want. I also make other sort of throw-away filtered profiles to experiment. Any filters I like I bring into my primary filtered analytics profile. I've never bothered to filter these sites, because they make up such a small proportion of my traffic. But I am seeing them show up from time to time. I imagine for those with less traffic, these might show up as a significant source of traffic. Is that what's going on for you?": 2, "here's a little startup capital /u/changetip $25": 3, "Idk, just wondering. Ok sounds like it won't then, thanks for the confirmation.

A good SEO will march into your business and make sure that this is implemented. Most projects I have taken on over the years, have ended once this stuff was done because it is the most valuable stuff you can implement.\n\nGenerally, when people tell me they want to hire a "good online marketer," it means they want a silver bullet. It doesn\'t really work quite that way. What I did as an online marketer with clients is I got paid to tell them what to do.\n\nSo I would make sure that the Google guide is in place. For betting, I would start writing articles on things to bet on. Get people onto the site looking to make bets. I would probably do a lot of articles on smart contracts. I would be doing things on weird esoteric things like prediction markets, assassination markets, sports, UFC fights, etc. Betting is a hard industry because you\'re competitors are generally spammers. Kudos to anyone who can compete in a spam industry. It\'s not fun at all because the rankings are so short lived and nominally valuable if you aren\'t great at getting them (low payoffs for a lot of effort for most people).\n\nIn gambling, your essentially monetizing content. So you need to be writing 10-15 articles each day on the thing(s) you want people to be betting on. Thrwo the occasional, "how bitcoin will kill betting," article out there just for posterity. But you gotta realize, if you have a business that exists because cash money is good at doing cash money things, and your only value proposition is, "we do the same thing those trusted sites do, but we do it with Bitcoin," you are going to limit your pool of users to only the Bitcoin community. To users that come ot the site, you need to explain teh value proposition - not convert them to Bitcoin. You need to say, "this is why we use Bitcoin and don\'t/can\'t take credit cards or wire transfers."

But for the most part, if you want to do a big education campaign, it's a lot easier to do with 1) an experienced marketer and 2) a lot of money. If you don't have either of these things, you're going to have to rely on a lot of luck. Generally, it's better to make a market, then use that market to release a product. Like with Alarm Grid, for example, it might make sense for us to develop and release a security system someday. I assume it is not a good idea. But if you look at the space, that's the trend right now. Canary, Simplisafe, Scout, and more are doing this exact thing. They disagree.

I never put them in anymore. The only thing that meta keywords will do is really just forecast to your competitors which keywords you\'re targeting. That said, I don\'t even recommend targeting specific keywords anymore. I think it\'s important to take a holistic approach here. Write tight, good, on-subject content. And then write a lot more of it. Interlink them on-site with good descriptive text.\n\n> search description\n\nMeta descriptions do not have anything to do with rankigns anymore. They can affect clickthrus. Matt Cutts made a great recommendation. Don\'t worry about optimizing every description. Write them in cases where you are getting bad traffic, or where you think you could improve your clickthrus. webmaster.google.com is a great way to measure that stuff.\n\n> starratings\n\nThese are important when they are used appropriately. You want to use ratings for things that need ratings. Yoast should be using schema.org\'s protocol to make this easy. Joost is a very competent developer (despite loving Wordpress). I haven\'t looked at Yoast recently, but star ratings are great (if they are used appropriately). When you decide to add them ask yourself the question, "would I benefit from knowing the rating on this content?"

Probably discuss why Bitcoin is better for sending money than moneygrams. Generally, this content is pretty thin. Good, but thin. Finally, if ya'll want this to rank well, you should make sure that you link to this resource in a relevant, good blog post that you write about it.": 1, 'Well, getting legitimate links won\'t hurt your site. There is a lot of discussion around the perils of things like guest blogging. These sorts of discussions are stupid. If an article has a link to your site because the link makes sense to put there, you won\'t get penalized. I ask all of our vendors to write us up, talk about how we\'re doing something unique because it helps them, it\'s a sort of testimonial, and the links definitely help us. they are good links because the content is relevant and good. The article isn\'t as good and useful as a NYT article, but it\'s good. And I really don\'t care if it\'s dofollow or nofollow. Write good content, get some links. I really don\'t believe strongly in link hunting anymore though. So, get links when you can. But basically, just kind of do good content on your site, and on other people\'s sites.\n\nThat online FAQ strategy that I link to way at the top is gold. If you want content, that will give you content forever, and it\'s good content. Really really good content. It was written up in Search Engine Watch in an article entitled [16 Secret Google Analytics Advanced Segments Worth Their Weight in Gold](http://searchenginewatch.com/sew/how-to/2268458/16-secret-google-analytics-advanced-segments-worth-their-weight-in-gold). You can get a ton of mileage from it. Oh, and it\'s free to implement.\n\nBlog a lot. Use YouTube. Leverage Facebook. Use Mailchimp if it\'s useful. Tweet a lot. I mean, you gotta get creative. If you want to get some inspiration for fun things you can do, google "[Wil Reynolds](http://www.seerinteractive.com/about/team/wil-reynolds/)." He\'s always been one of my favorite thinkers in this space. He has a team of people doing big projects in Philadelphia and he has built a creative, inventive environment wherein his marketers are allowed to try some of the weirdest things you could imagine. I like to think I\'m great at this, but I\'m always humbled when he says stuff because some of it is so obvious but weirdly off the wall. I just can\'t believe I didn\'t think of trying it. But he basically does this AMA strategy where he gives all his secrets away for the purpose of benefiting everyone. His tactic works. It gets him business. But it also means for those that can\'t afford him, you can build your site using the same tactics a big agency does. His best message is do RBS (which means Real Business Shit). Don\'t worry too much about gimmicks, don\'t try to influence rankings through manipulation. Just write good content, host good events, get real links from real, useful places. Don\'t worry about where your next link is going to come from. Think of how to get another useful user to do what you want them to do. That might mean you bid on a keyword using adwords, it might mean you write an article about Kraft cheese being sued for buying too much wheat last year, it might mean you host a pie eating contest in your local city. But if you are asking about tactics that destroy your site, you\'re in the wrong frame of mind. As "how do I build my business?"  instead.\n\nAny marketer worth their salt should be in that same mindset, asking, "how do I build your business." If a marketer tells you all about the links they will get you, or the keywords they will rank you for... they are not going to get you results.': 2, "Depending on the niche, local search can be hard or easy. Most niches are really not that difficult. For the best resource on local search, you need to read [David Mihm's yearly report on local ranking factors](http://moz.com/local-search-ranking-factors).\n\nFor the get started guide on my end...\n\nOn-site:\nMake sure there is a page dedicated to the location. Make sure that the Name, Address, and Phone number (NAP) listings are on the page and marked up by schema.org. In the meta title on the page, I usually use the format [This service or product in City, State].\n\nOn the page, I make sure that there is lots of text (minimum of 300-500 words). The text will be personable, but it will also have great keywords related to the location. Make sure to mention the location a few times as well as the service(s)/product(s) being sold in the text.\n\nGet a [google places page](http://www.google.com/business/), get a [bing local listing](https://www.bingplaces.com/), and then [head on over to Yahoo and do the same](https://smallbusiness.yahoo.com/local-listings). Probably worth grabbing the [Yelp.com page](https://biz.yelp.com/) as well.\n\nThen there are a number of services that you need to sign up with for aggregating data. The way that the local search algorithms work is distinctly different than the organic algorithms. Whereas, for example, links matter a lot in organic listings, in local listings it's the listings online that list your NAP and the quality of those sites. There are about 200 billion other factors (exaggeration), but those are the two big ones. Take a look at [this](http://d2eeipcrcdle6.cloudfront.net/learn/Local_Search_Ecosystem_US.pdf) if you want to understand the local search ecosystem.\n\nOnce you've claimed all your listings on the search engines, you need to get your data to one of the aggregators. The aggregator you use will make this very simple. Make sure your data is correct, make sure you pick all the right codes/numbers, and then head on over to [one](https://moz.com/local/bulk/unmanaged/verified) [of](http://ubl.org/) [the](https://www.neustarlocaleze.biz/welcome/) [aggregators](http://www.infogroup.com/), and sign up (I recommend moz.com's or UBL's aggregators. If you want to do it right, you will probably need to pay between $30-$100 or more each year per location.\n\nNow, you need reviews. If you can do these three things, in a low-competition to medium/high competition niche, you will do just fine for local. Do your best to get reviews on lots and lots of sites too :). This will all take about 45 minutes to an hour per location.\n\n": 1, "Hey Gabriel, I don't do client work anymore.

For an online strategy, I would take it straight to wallet questions. I would get ranking for every keyword associated with "iphone Bitcoin wallets," "Bitcoin apps," "Why Apple doesn\'t like Bitcoin apps," "Should I buy an android or iPhone if I\'m into Bitcoin," "What is the best Bitcoin wallet," and all sorts of questions like that.\n\nI generally do what I can to own the space, and with Bitcoin there is no reason that someone can\'t download your wallet alongside other people\'s wallet.\n\nMore content ideas:\n"Mycelium vs Airbitz"\n\n"Mycelium vs. Breadwallet"\n\n"Mycelium vs. Coinbase"\n\n"Mycelium vs. Circle"\n\n"Airbitz vs. Breadwallet"\n\n"Airbitz vs. Coinbase"\n\n"Airbitz vs. Circle"\n\n"Breadwallet vs. Coinbase"\n\n"Breadwallet vs. Circle"\n\n"What is the best Bitcoin wallet?"\n\nOwn the conversation around all wallet discussion.

You gotta realize, if drug dealers and money launderers are willing to use Bitcoin, it's because it works, not because it doesn't work.

I remember when [Chuck Schumer got on television and told the world how to purchase drugs using the internet](http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/123187958.html), did the world say holy hell, get rid of that?\n\nNo...\n\nThe date of that article above is June 5, 2011. I suspect that the reason you're here today has a lot to do with the early drug markets. You have to realize that Bitcoin solves the Byzantine General's problem. People don't understand why that's important, or whether it's important at all. But the effect of that is that as long as the network is big enough, this so-called PR problem doesn't matter. Bitcoin is agnostic to your opinions about laundering money and using drugs. And that agnosticism is a large source of its utility. It is valuable because of it's PR problem. So I think that people need to embrace Bitcoin for all the reasons it allows you to commit crimes. Because in the same way you can commit crime with BTC, you can also do more good than anyone has ever been capable of. You can send funds into North Korea, Zimbabwe, any place with despotic dictator. And you can do it without anyone's permission. That same feature lets you send money to drug dealers and your mafioso compadres with impunity.  ": 2, 'The future is now :). We will see what happens.

Google is dumber than people think. It can't see what it can't read. When you put up a video on the internet, Google only knows what you put in the title and what you put in the description.

My guess is that Circle is hoping you keep your coins in their system. That said, for a financial company like Circle, $5/lead is probably ridiculously cheap. If you\'re doing lead gen for a financial company, they are going to pay you $50+ for each lead. So for a company to win those kinds of leads, it is a really cheap way to get those leads.

It was like 2am or 3am. We were his last call of the night. When we asked him how many Bitcoiners had called that day, he said 0. I realized that if BitPay's employees (CEO included) couldn't be bothered to use their Bitcoins... let's just say something smelled fishy.\n\nThe reason is because merchant adoption is great for Bitcoin's users. But there probably aren't more than around 60,000 of us in all reality. So if you want to focus on merchants you probably need to focus on building the user base. Tipping non-Bitcoiners on reddit is really functional. I thinkt hat probably grows the user base a lot. And it does it witout requiring the expansion of merchant adoption because tipping (I suspect) is a largely closed loop economy. The tips get tipped. So you don't need Microsoft to accept BTC while people start tipping each other with it. I think we probably learned that from DOGE coin.\n\nMy guess is that we'll see BitPay disappear. Probably get subsumed by a bigger company, maybe it's clients will be rolled into CoinBase. I think that the first place we will see widespread merchant adoption are going to be Marijuana dispensories. I think we will are on the bring of seeing widespread user adoption in places where having money presents more risk (risk being a function of volatility and opportunity cost) than having Bitcoin.

Bitcoin is perhaps the very first commodity with a perfectly inelastic *supply*. All other commodities respond to changes in price with changes in rate of production. Price of gold goes up; more mines become economical to operate; more gold enters the market. Price of gold falls; some mines become uneconomical to operate and so shut down; less gold enters the market. Bitcoin doesn't work like this. Price of Bitcoin goes down; some mining operations become uneconomical and shut down; rate of Bitcoin production remains constant. Unlike most market forces, which are self-correcting (in a negative feedback loop), Bitcoin's price lacks this feedback mechanism. This means the rate of production continues unabated when price is low, thus continuing to drive the price down hard. It also means the rate of production continues without increase when the price is high, which means there is no rush of new supply to moderate the price.

Doubtless you\'ve heard some (or all) of these criticisms before, but I\'d be interested in your responses:\n\n-Bitcoin is a solution looking for a problem.  The fiat system frankly seems to work just fine -- why do we need this?  It seems like a lot of bitcoiners buy into the whole "the fed is a conspiracy" thing, which would give bitcoin a genuine purpose, but I just don\'t believe that.  Nor do I think that the transaction costs associated with international remittances are burdensome enough to justify the global shake-up that replacing our currency with bitcoin requires.\n\n-Bitcoin seems to have a lot of security and usability problems.  "Being your own bank" is hard.  People have to jump through a lot of hoops to keep their bitcoins reasonably secure, what with paper wallets and cold storage and Trezors and whatnot.  People lose keys, or they get malware that coughs up their keys, they get hacked, etc.  People make mistakes.  It seems exhausting; I just have my paycheck direct deposited into my bank and I never even have to think about it.\n\n-The whole "lack of trusted intermediaries" thing is a problem.  I don\'t understand why bitcoiners seem to think that chargebacks are the devil; they\'re a vital consumer protection, and they _facilitate_ commerce rather than frustrate it (the whole reason I\'m willing to buy stuff over the from strangers over the Internet so readily is because I know that, in the unlikely event that I get screwed over, I can do a chargeback).  The irreversible nature of bitcoin transactions is a real problem, and the proposed solutions (multisig, etc.) seem to be more complex than the systems that are already in place.\n\n-Bitcoin is inherently deflationary, which is just terrible economics because it incents hoarding and rewards the wealthy for doing literally _nothing_ with their money.  I know there are a lot of wealthy people under the fiat system who live on interest, but they get that interest because they make their wealth available to others (either as an equity stake in an enterprise or as a loan made for interest).  In a deflationary system, you could literally keep your bitcoins in paper wallets under your mattress and somehow get wealthier.  That leads to economic stagnation and a whole bunch of other problems.\n\n-More broadly, the increase of the bitcoin money supply is completely untethered to what\'s happening in the real economy.  A central bank is unable to apply the brakes during a bubble by lowering the money supply, or unable to provide a boost during a recession by increasing it.  Again, if you\'re one of those "the fed is evil" folks, then I guess this is a good thing, but I just don\'t think so.\n\n**The below is largely speculative criticism about the bitcoin community in general.  It may not apply to you, and it\'s possible that I\'m just wrong, but it\'s my perception.**\n\n-I think that many (perhaps most) bitcoiners are more concerned with becoming fiat-rich than they are with actually seeing bitcoin succeed.  Many are just waiting for another bubble (assuming one ever comes) so they can dump their bitcoins and walk away with "real (fiat) money" at the expense of "bag holders" who are seduced into thinking that bitcoin is going to change the world somehow.  That\'s distasteful, to the extent that it\'s true.\n\n-Out of those who really want to see bitcoin succeed, I think that, for many of them, the allure is being part of the new elite that adopted bitcoin early and become wealthy _just for that reason_.  It\'s like a social lottery ticket; they bought 10 BTC when they were "merely" $600 each, and now each bitcoin is worth millions of dollars and they\'re captains of industry.  Not by building anything of value, mind:  This whole hypothetical redistribution of wealth will happen just because they bought bitcoins earlier than most other folks.  I find that distasteful, too.': 3, "Not even this, it's a geographic thing. For the moment, money works in the USA for consumers and business.

You actually understand and use your brain!\n\nThe benefit for me of being my own bank - I do have bank accounts too btw :) - is that I 100% control it and it helps me budget. If I move money around my bank accounts for budgeting and savings etc it soon makes a mess, makes financial applications difficult (when they go through your banking history) and when mixed in with all the automated debits and card transactions etc. it\'s just hard to follow. I didn\'t just dive in to bitcoin as soon as I learned of it (man, I wish I had!!).. it took time for me to realise that it was actually a really valuable tool not just for the obvious reasons of being a global decentralised currency etc. but for budgeting and money control. As others have said, it really does encourage and facilitate saving more than you would normally - even with the volatility. When I receive income I reserve some in my bank account for automated debits and card purchases but most goes straight into bitcoin and I control it from there, if I need some back in my bank account it\'s not time-consuming to do, in fact - with all the security involved with online banking nowadays bitcoin is a bucket load easier to quickly make a payment. For example when I order a takeaway, I can either call up and pay with cash - no thanks, or I can pay online and either store my card details online - no thanks or type them in every time - no thanks. With bitcoin and takeaway.com I just pick my food, click pay, scan QR, done. \n\nFees. I\'m not convinced either that Bitcoin saves money on fees. It does for me but that\'s a long story that I won\'t get into. But for your average user you\'re right, the fees are still there, though international transactions definitely save money - currency conversion rates with banks are diabolical. Also, because I actively trade a little bit I do tend to buy my bitcoin at lower rates than I spend it at which takes care of any fees levied by merchants/BitPay, I can\'t do that with a bank. Not easily and instantly anyway and not with small amounts either. I don\'t know if it is the same where you are based but often card transactions involve fees too - airlines a prime example where their fees for using a credit card far outweigh any BitPay/merchant fees.\n\nBank services.. yes my bank provides services Bitcoin can\'t and I appreciate them.. such as an overdraft, insurance, extras such as breakdown cover and travel/gadget insurance.. I pay my monthly fee for that happily and get my money\'s worth. \n\nFinally, and this one kinda explains my pro-bitcoin stance if my recent comments above don\'t. I hate banks. Last year my life and my business were near-ruined for a month by my main bank. All of my accounts, business and personal, were frozen - totally unrelated to bitcoin or any wrongdoing I should add. I had no access to ATMs, cards, online banking, telephone banking, even branch banking. I couldn\'t send or receive money, automated or manually. I effectively had no bank account for a month. It seriously hurt me, my family and my business and a whole heap of shit has happened since that event, because of that event, that I\'m still suffering right now. For instance, all of my automated debits were rejected - so all of my insurance, phones, etc were cancelled.. Put somewhat dramatically I was suddenly left with no car (because no insurance), no income, no pet/mobile/home/etc insurance, no access to money whatsoever.. I couldn\'t pay my mortgage, utility bills, tax, I couldn\'t even buy food. The bank didn\'t care. I cannot go through that again, ever. And no, I can\'t just switch banks - because all of that absolutely destroyed my credit rating so I now get refused until that has passed. The nail in the coffin.. after taking my bank to the financial ombudsman, and winning, I was paid peanuts in compensation and the transaction that sparked the whole thing was just a regular payment from a business client that was in no way fraudulent and if they\'d simply asked the sender\'s bank to verify it would have been confirmed.

I don\'t think that says all that much.\n\n>or what happens if Overstock decides to hang onto more BTC.\n\nProbably nothing, but it does indicate that Overstock really isn\'t too bullish about the whole bitcoin thing, no?  Hasn\'t overstock always been kind of held up on a pedestal as a company that really buys into the idea of bitcoin?

Is that more or less cumbersome than Western Union?\n\n>I don\'t have to worry about cancelling payment if it doesn\'t work out\n\nYou mean you don\'t have the _option_ of cancelling payment if it doesn\'t work out; if you buy something with bitcoin and the  "transaction doesn\'t work out," well, whoever was paying is just out of luck.

You sound like a reasonable dude, and the criticisms that I leveled at the "bitcoin community" don\'t seem to apply to you; you\'re comfortable with the risk/responsibility that bitcoin imposes (and you value the freedom from the financial system that bitcoin offers), you benefit from the lowered transaction costs that it may provide, and you\'re not looking to get rich by speculating and pumping (and then dumping at someone else\'s expense).\n\nI guess my only suggestion would be to critically think about what bitcoin offers you.  I\'m going to blather on at you a little bit here, mostly because I\'m interested in hearing your responses; I could be wrong about this stuff.\n\nWhat\'s the benefit of "being your own bank?"  Are existing banks untrustworthy enough to make that a plus?  The foreclosure crisis and ensuing "Great Recession" in the US indicates that banks are sometimes clownshoes, but that doesn\'t put their _depositors\'_ money at risk.  Banks are required to carry deposit insurance (at least in the States; I would imagine that European countries have similar requirements -- the UK has FSCS, for example), and I don\'t think that any innocent depositor has lost their money because of their bank\'s poor decisions if that bank is required to maintain deposit insurance.  \n\nBanks do charge fees, but they provide services in exchange for those fees; they protect your money (and carry insurance to protect you if they mess up), they handle all of the "legwork" behind the scenes for you to use your money or move it around (you can swipe a visa debit card almost anywhere in any industrialized country because of the systems they\'ve set up), they give you chargeback rights to protect you from fraud, they produce reports and paperwork to help you with recordkeeping and taxes.  Sometimes they give you 1-2% cashback just for using a credit card (which you can pay off every month, if you\'re just using the card for expenses for which you\'d otherwise pay cash).  You can certainly be your own bank, and you can save some money in fees and not have to trust anyone but yourself, but you lose a lot in the bargain.  If you make a mistake and get robbed, there\'s no safety net.  If you engage in a transaction and get scammed, and there aren\'t any protections for you.  At best, it\'s a slightly cheaper and much more dangerous world to live in.\n\nAs for international transactions:  I\'d encourage you to ask yourself how much money you\'re really saving by using bitcoin in this context.  I\'d imagine that just about anyone you\'re sending money to internationally is really interested in ending up with whatever their local fiat currency is; companies can\'t pay their employees or suppliers in bitcoin, and individuals can\'t buy groceries with it.  Whoever the recipient of the funds happens to be, they\'re probably going to want to end up with their local fiat.  That involves a currency exchange or a payment processor, and that currency exchange or payment processor is going to want to make a fair profit for the service that they provide.  That means fees.  If you\'re buying something from a merchant, I can almost guarantee you that those fees are going to be passed along to you (why would the merchant accept less profit for the privilege of accepting bitcoin?).  If you\'re sending money to an individual, you\'re saddling them with whatever the exchange fees happen to be (as well as the hassle of actually going through the transactions with an exchange).  Is that really better than what Western Union (or whoever) offers?': 2, 'Dude, bitcoin in a stable economy is nothing but fluff. You guys in the 1st world are just nags.

Everyone is well aware that 50% less coins will be produced after block 420,000. This will be priced in accordingly.

Yes, the difficulty will eventually adjust, but since so few miners remain, the time to solve the next block could jump from 10 minutes to several hours.

A few things that come to mind:\n\n* The E.O. seems more like a "law" than the FAQ on the treasury website.  Therefore the FAQ doesn\'t hold much weight for me. I imagine if i was in a court room because i "violated" the E.O. bringing up the FAQ from the treasury website would only give the Judge a chuckle, nothing more. I imagine the judge would just say that the Secretary of Treasury said (doesn\'t matter how they said it, since it doesn\'t specify in the EO) that the person i donated too was in violation of EO 13694, section 1(a). If i brought up what you seem to be saying about how sanctions worked in the past, mention the OFAC, etc. the judge could simply point out the EO 13694 and how it doesn\'t mention the OFAC, or the SDN list.\n\n* It seems to me like because you are talking about things outside of the EO 13694, and how sanctions work in general people are more skeptical.  If I\'ve never heard of the primary executor, OFAC, SDN list, etc and they aren\'t listed in the EO then i just have to take your word for it.  Unless it\'s common knowledge once you understand how sanctions work; I assume most people don\'t understand how sanctions work.\n\n* if my last point is valid then i think your best bet is to educate people on how sanctions work. Telling them over and over that Snowden isn\'t included in the SDN list will do nothing. Also telling them yourself how sanctions work means nothing, because i have no idea who you are, and therefore have no way to tell if you are credible.\n': 2, 'No problem.

They then indicted them and bankrupted them.\n\nMy point with the story is that the DoJ didn\'t have to follow the law, it was able to get convictions for things that weren\'t crimes, much like when they threaten people with money or contracts that say a company will provide legal support, who they otherwise couldn\'t convict, saying that they will indict family members if they don\'t confess to a series of conspiracy charges.  Interesting note and the WSJ has written about this a number of times, people often have "conspiracy to commit X" where X isn\'t something illegal.

There are internal signatures in the device itself, which you can see in the settings.txt file. We figured users would rely on those, not the website firmware and sig.\n\nWe only ended up putting up the firmware on our site, along with the signature, after a bunch of stickers were torn off, and users were concerned about device tampering during shipping, for which we recommended reflashing the units with our original firmware just to make sure the units are back to their original condition (which would only work if the signature in the settings.txt was correct). So if it wasn\'t for the shipping issues, this whole thing wouldn\'t have been an issue to begin with, and users would have simply relied on the signature in the settings.txt file, and those who were a bit more security conscious would have just added their own salt to the devices as well. And if you are completely paranoid, you can still download the open source code from our github, verify all the code, build your own firmware from that, and flash that.

[Technically](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039.mediawiki#from-mnemonic-to-seed), it\'s a salt which is used when deriving a seed from the mnemonic, which means any passphrase is accepted, but you\'ll get a different seed (and thus wallet) depending on which passphrase you enter.\n\nThis is also what gives you so-called plausible deniability if you use two different passphrases to arrive at two different wallets: use one passphrase to arrive at your primary wallet, where you put your long-term holdings, and another passphrase to arrive at a secondary wallet - which you could use for small amounts, daily spending and as a decoy if you\'re ever forced to give up your passphrase or someone tries to force you to "show" how many bitcoins you own.\n\nYou can read about it it Trezor\'s manual [here](http://doc.satoshilabs.com/trezor-user/advanced_settings.html#using-passphrase-encrypted-seeds).\n\nSo:\n\n1. You initialize your Trezor, chosing to add a PIN and a passphrase (then write down the mnemonic, typically 24 words). The mnemonic will be stored in the device while the PIN and passphrase won\'t.\n\n2. The PIN is only needed for [some operations](http://doc.satoshilabs.com/trezor-tech/protection_levels.html) and will typically not be asked until you want to sign a transaction or message. The PIN is a device setting, meaning you\'ll be asked the *same* PIN regardless of which HD wallet/account you\'re trying to use. It\'s not important to write down, as you can reset/recover your wallet without it.\n\n3. A passphrase, however, is integral to deriving the wallet seed - and seeing as it\'s forgotten once you unplug the Trezor, it means the Trezor doesn\'t actually store your full wallet seed (unless you chose not to use a passphrase, of course), it only stores the mnemonic (24 words) which would otherwise be quite tedious to enter every time.\n\n When you connect your Trezor (e.g. to myTrezor or Mycelium) you\'ll be asked to supply a passphrase so it can complete the seed generation and derive your wallet from it.\n\n4. Finally, for additional security, you decide on (or ideally: randomly generate) and write down two different passphrases, one for your main wallet and one for your secondary.\n\n You should memorize at least the secondary wallet\'s passphrase so that you can spend small amounts on-the-go, but you should store both passwords safely and tell some trusted party how to retrieve them (in case you have a memory loss or die), just like the mnemonic words themselves.\n\n If you lose or damage the Trezor or for whatever other reason need to recover the wallet elsewhere, you can use the mnemonic + passphrase to set it up from scratch (either in a second Trezor device or some other BIP44-supporting software - like Mycelium).\n\nIf you follow this procedure, it should give you protection against software attacks (which can\'t get at the keys in the Trezor) as well as theft (they won\'t have the PIN or the passphrase) and possibly even physical threats (you can try to only give up the passphrase for the secondary wallet and see if that throws them off).': 1, "I guess this is not the default as demo videos usually don't show entering a passphrase. But I found a demonstration [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hvLcfJ6DFE). I'm a bit confused though that the passphrase is entered on the computer rather than on the Trezor. I thought it should be possible to use a Trezor on a compromised computer. Why else is PIN entry so convoluted?": 1, '> I guess this is not the default as demo videos usually don\'t show entering a passphrase.\n\nCorrect; using a passphrase is not the default, while a PIN is required. You can see the initial setup process in the first images of [this album](https://imgur.com/a/GILb3). You don\'t get to decide whether you want a passphrase or not initially, i.e. the same design choice Mycelium has made.\n\nWhy? My guess would be that people normally expect a "password" like this to be restorable or overwritable if they forget it, while here it would mean that you\'d lose access to your wallet with no recourse. Thus, it\'s a good idea that you do your research and understand the implications of a BIP39 passphrase before you enable it.\n\nYou can enable passphrases under [advanced settings](https://imgur.com/a/GILb3#nypfljA) (meaning that myTrezor/Mycelium will start asking you for a phrase as part of its startup flow).\n\n> I\'m a bit confused though that the passphrase is entered on the computer rather than on the Trezor. I thought it should be possible to use a Trezor on a compromised computer.\n\nIt is. The compromised computer will never learn the wallet seed words (BIP39 mnemonic) or private keys even if it learns the passphrase.\n\nThe main point of using passphrases is protecting your seed words backup (i.e. they\'re useless without the passphrase - as long as the passphrase isn\'t stored along with them, of course) and possibly to create the plausible deniability setup as explained above.\n\n> Why else is PIN entry so convoluted?\n\nYou\'d have to ask the developers about this, but primarily because it was possible. When thinking of security, you normally want several layers of security. With PINs, it was possible to make a way to hide this from the computer - so why not do it? With passphrases, displaying a full keyboard on the Trezor is impractical.\n\nKeep in mind that the *main* purpose of the PIN is to prevent people from stealing your money just because they have physical access to your Trezor. Entering the PIN in the way it\'s done makes it a lot harder to casually observe it "over the shoulder" of someone - i.e. the same kind of security that ATMs and PoS terminals asks you to apply when covering your PIN code.': 1, 'We have a multisig vault, which offers the best of both worlds (2/3 keys required to sign, you hold 2, we hold the third).

Your self directed IRA can have a brokerage account too. \n\nThere are custodial fees involved though. I recall a $500 annual fee plus $x per asset or trabsaction (where x= $35 to $50). So, if you're just staring saving for your retirement, and only have a years worth of contributions in it (or worse, if you couldn't make a full contribution) then the fees as a percentage of assets will make it not worth it at all.
