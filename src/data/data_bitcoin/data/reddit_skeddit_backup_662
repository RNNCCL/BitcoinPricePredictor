Exchange services are fine to use to buy or sell bitcoins, but only store your money somewhere you can keep control of your own private keys.  Do not leave your money in the exchange as if it were a bank.  The point of Bitcoin is to remove the need to trust a bank to store your money.\n\nDo not invest in hash mining / cloud mining contracts.  If you want to mine, mine with equipment you physically control and can point to a pool of your choice. \n\nStick to Bitcoin.  Stay away from altcoins.  Paycoin was not a Bitcoin debacle.  It was a Paycoin debacle.  Anyone who was involved with Paycoin/GAW could have avoided all the pain by following the above recommendations.\n\nIn other words, best practices for Bitcoin are the same as they've always been.  People who insist on not following best practices increase their chances of being burned, usually by a third party that they shouldn't have trusted losing / taking their money.\n\nAs of today Bitcoin is risky.  If you want to use it for what the technology was designed for, get a small amount and experiment with using it.  Send it, receive it, remit it, donate it, save it, share it.

Which is of course silly: people laugh at lots of artists (and musicians, etc. etc.), but only a very small fraction of those laughed-at artists turn out to be geniuses.

Decide what you're in this for. Is it fun? Then only put in the amount that keeps it fun, even if your chosen coin goes to zero. Is it an investment? Then be very, very sure that you understand exactly why you think it will eventually be profitable (i.e., for a coin: how much acceptance does it need to succeed in the way you expect? And how likely is it that it will gain that degree of acceptance, especially since a lot of people are wary of putting their money in largely untested currencies?)\n\nAnother piece of advice: the fact that some currency is, in your opinion, totally revolutionary and brilliant does not in any way guarantee adoption.

I have a couple of thoughts.\n\nAs I see it, a key challenge will be verifying that file parts you have received are actually fragments of the file you want. This could be doneby checking hashes of fragments against a trusted peer who has verified the file post-download.\n\nSince the cost of each file fragment is low, the risk for the downloader sending a (micropayment) before receiving the file is low. If the file sender does not send the fragment, the client could disconnect from that user having only lost $0.01 (say) and then maybe blacklist for other users, or do something more clever like note the number of successfully received file parts before disconnection.\n\nThe blacklisting and trusted peer aspects of these ideas would rely on a robust reputation system based on signatures.\n\n**Incremental micro payments can be built up off the bitcoin blockchain then settled in a single transaction in such a way that the sender can't be ripped off using multisignature addresses and timelocks as detailed** [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/26z7wf/bitcoinj_micropayment_demo/)": 3, '[deleted]': 1, "**Request stage**\n\nWe start with Bob requesting the piece from Alice. During this request, Bob includes two transactions in his message:\n\n1. The (signed-by-Bob) commit transaction\n2. The (unsigned) finalize transaction\n\nThe commit transaction is a [coinjoin](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=279249.0)-style or [lighthouse](https://github.com/vinumeris/lighthouse)-style transaction in the sense that we have multiple inputs owned by multiple parties. There are two inputs and one output. The 2 inputs of the commit transaction are 1 satoshi from Alice and 2 satoshis from Bob. The one output of the commit transaction is a [p2sh](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Pay_to_script_hash) to the finalize transaction.\n\nThe important point here is that both parties have to sign the commit transaction in order for it to take effect. The atomicity of the commit operation is ensured when both of these signatures are applied and published on the blockchain. For larger amounts, you may require a couple of confirmations, but for torrent-level requirements in performance, Alice probably wants to execute at the moment she receives the fully signed commit transaction. However, if you want extra security, you can make multiple requests, wait for confirmation, and then respond, sacrificing speed.\n\nThe finalize transaction is a 2-of-2 [multisig](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/3718/what-are-multi-signature-transactions) transaction requiring a signature from both Alice and Bob. It has a 1 input and 2 outputs. The input of the finalize transaction is the output of the commit transaction. The 2 outputs of the finalize transaction are 1 satoshi to Bob and 2 satoshis to Alice.\n\nThe finalize transaction script has to be included in this first protocol message, as Alice needs to verify that the p2sh is valid by hashing the script of the finalize transaction. In this first message, Bob also includes his signature on his commit transaction input.\n\n**Response stage**\n\nAlice receives Bob's message and verifies that the commit transaction has the correct data: Both her key and Bob's key must be included in the inputs. She then hashes the finalize transaction and confirms that the output of the commit transaction matches. She also verifies that Bob's signature is valid on the input of the commit transaction, that the amount outputted from the commit transaction is at minimum 2 satoshis, that her input on the commit transaction is a maximum of 1 satoshi, and that Bob's input on the commit transaction is at minimum 2 satoshis, and that the sum of the inputs is larger or equal to the output amount.\n\nShe also confirms that the finalize transaction has the correct data: That the input amount is larger or equal to the sum of the outputs, and that her output is at least 2 satoshis. She also checks that it is a proper 2-of-2 multisig script and that the 2 multisig keys belong to Alice and Bob.\n\nUpon verification of this, Alice signs the commit transaction and the finalize transaction, publishes the fully signed commit transaction on the blockchain, and sends back to Bob the requested torrent piece, the \xe2\x80\x93now fully signed and valid\xe2\x80\x93 commit transaction, and the half-signed finalize transaction.\n\n**Finalization stage**\n\nBob receives the torrent piece and checks its hash against the torrent Merkle tree for validity. Once he confirms that the piece is valid, he signs the finalize transaction. At this stage, the finalize transaction has two signatures, so Bob publishes it on the blockchain. Upon publication, all payments are made and the security deposits are returned to the transacting parties.\n\nThis completes the technical details of the protocol implementation using bitcoin.\n\nKeep in mind that you can bundle multiple torrent pieces together, and this would probably be better in terms of bitcoin fees. There's nothing that requires the torrent to be paid piece-by-piece. In the above protocol, Bob can easily request 10 or 100 pieces and only finalize once all of them are received.\n\nTo add the miner and content creator to this equation, one simply has to modify the finalize transaction and add more outputs. While the parties are not incentivized to do so, they can if they wish, and fair clients should implement this by default. Of course, once someone has a song, they can pirate it, but they can also choose to play fair and compensate the creator. Both the sender and the receiver of a piece can abort the transaction at the first stage if they see that the finalize transaction does not include a pay-out to the content creator or miner. Care must be taken to associate the correct content creator with each content and to verify the percentage amount requested by the content creator.\n\nOne alleged problem with MAD is that of extortion: Any party can threaten the other to keep the funds locked, and, from a game-theory point-of-view, the other party would have to comply and agree to a lower output for themselves. However, if the software is coded in a way that does not accept extortion, the transacting parties will be sure that the other party will not attempt it, as it is unlikely that they will succeed in getting any payment at all, and probably will just lose their money. Furthermore, no one is expected to change their own software to be able to accept extortions by others.\n\nFinally, one additional problem may be that Alice, in the above scheme, must have bitcoins in order to seed. This should not be a problem, as Alice has already paid for the song in order to be able to seed it, so she must have some bitcoin wallet already. In any case, it is a requirement for Alice to have some bitcoins in place, as this is needed to ensure she will not back off from the deal, similar to the way Bob needs to pay a little more initially. This also requires that the content creator has some bitcoin available to use as deposit when bootstrapping the scheme.\n\nOne last problem is network connectivity issues: If the connection is dropped or the piece is not transmitted correctly, the money is burned. This should not be a problem. While transaction reversibility comes to mind, it's not necessary to build such complicated features into the node: Just assume that you may have to pay a couple of cents more to retrieve a song and you may make a couple of cents less when you're seeding a song, if network difficulties occur. No one will cancel transactions purposefully anyway, so this should be a rare occasion.\n\nThanks for building this, these are some amazing ideas and I'm looking forward to using it!": 3, "It sounds like an awesome idea in theory.  In practice though, I can see some potential problems, even if you figure out a perfect protocol for doing it.\n\nOne problem is people will very quickly pirate the content.  Let's say the content creator charges $1 to download the torrent.  There will be people who will rush to download it, make their own torrent, then start charging $0.50 to download it, stealing the profits from the content creator.\n\nSince bittorent is really designed to allow free and decentralized exchange of information, I don't really think it's a good system for selling your content.  If pirates are suddenly able to make profits in bitcoin through the bittorrent protocol, I think it will open up a whole host of new problems with piracy, more likely to harm the bittorrent and bitcoin scene than to help it.": 3, "This is the same comment that was posted on the youtube video:\n\nThis is exactly what smart contracts are all about.

It would be useful to also prove ownership of a file, but under this method someone else could simply post another transaction and include your hash.

It's a good concept.": 1, 'This is possible to do with one [MAD](http://nashx.com/Images/hownashxworks.png) (mutually-assured destruction) transaction per piece. While MAD may or may not work well for larger-scale transactions (such as in [OpenBazaar](https://www.reddit.com/r/openbazaar)), this is a great application for it.\n\nI\'m not sure whether MAD was ever implemented before over the bitcoin blockchain, but it has been implemented in a centralized way in [NASHX](http://nashx.com/). In this post I\'ll explain how you can implement this in a completely decentralized way using bitcoin. I\'m not completely sure this will work, so comments, criticism, and corrections are welcome. Some of these ideas came to mind in the recent [Z\xc3\xbcrich bitcoin meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Bitcoin-Meetup-Switzerland/), while others came to mind when talking about this privately with gubatron (OP).\n\nTo begin with, let\'s assume that you only want to pay the seeder and not the miner or the content creator. We\'ll talk about including them later.\n\nAssume we have two agents, Alice and Bob, who want to exchange a song or some other content. Alice has a piece of the song (or potentially the whole song), while Bob wants to receive this piece of the song. Bob is willing to pay some amount for this piece, let\'s say for argument\'s sake 1 [satoshi](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/FAQ#What_do_I_call_the_various_denominations_of_bitcoin.3F), and Alice agrees to get paid that amount. This agreement can be done in a side-channel, which has to be authenticated, as it will include bitcoin addresses.\n\nOnce the agreement is made, the parties will follow the MAD protocol. A high-level timeline of the protocol is this:\n\n1. Alice commits satoshi to a locked box.\n2. Bob commits 2 satoshis to the same locked box. This happens atomically together with #1.\n3. Once both of these satoshis have been committed, Alice sends the piece to Bob.\n4. Once Bob has received and verified the piece, he finalizes the transaction.\n5. Upon finalization, Alice receives 2 satoshis.\n6. Upon finalization, Bob receives 1 satoshi.\n\nAt the end of the protocol, Alice has been paid 1 satoshi, and Bob has received the piece. The reason why Alice has to pay 1 satoshi and Bob has to pay 2 satoshis at the beginning of the protocol is so that they are committed to performing the transaction fairly.\n\nLet\'s look at the two different scenarios you described in your video to see why the parties are disincentivized to cheat:\n\nCase A: Alice doesn\'t send the piece. This causes Alice to lose 1 satoshi and Bob to lose 2 satoshis. The money will be [burned](https://blog.openbazaar.org/why-proof-of-burn/), and so Alice does not want that, as she has made nothing out of it.\n\nCase B: Bob doesn\'t finalize the transaction. In that case, Bob has received a torrent piece, but has paid 2 satoshis, while Alice has paid 1 satoshi. This is not good for Bob, as he paid 2 satoshis to receive a torrent piece which is really only worth 1 satoshi.\n\nTherefore, both parties will play fair. So it\'s not necessary to encrypt the torrent pieces or anything, just send them in the clear.\n\nNow, for the technical part of this implementation, we\'ll work using 2 different bitcoin transactions, one for the "commit" phase and one for the "finalize" phase. I\'ll go through the protocol from a technical point of view in chronological order. The protocol requires two messages to be exchanged by the transacting parties, one from Bob to Alice (the request), and one from Alice to Bob (the response). The finalization stage simply requires a publication on the blockchain which can even be done at a later time and is not critical for performance.\n\nThe technical details are included as a reply to this comment.': 9, 'Thank you! thanks for chiming in, I remember our conversation.\n\nIt will all just be a matter of time with OB or similar alternatives for decentralized commerce.': 1, 'Here is the Storj whitepaper just in case: http://storj.io/storj.pdf': 2, "Somebody had same idea for TOR relays (will try to find some links).

So, they charge enough to cover costs and guarantee a profit for themselves while passing the mining risk on to the customer in the exact same way they do when selling physical miners.\n\nLike I've said elsewhere, cloud mining is just another way for ASIC manufacturers to sell hashing power and can actually be more profitable for customers due to the extra costs associated with physical miners.": 0, "I said math-impaired, not stupid or naive, but to keep the post concise, let's focus on the important part.\n\nUnless I'm misunderstanding your OP, as I said, there is no scam here.

They bring their new miners online and then sell for bitcoins when the difficulty already increased... double dip basically.': 1, 'Cloud mining services from the ASIC manufacturers are just another way for the manufacturers to sell hashing power. Neither options are scams but the cloud mining option is more profitable for most people unless they have very cheap or free electricity.': 0, "Which in large part is true, by the way. A lot of people who buy hardware indeed don't make money. And a lot of hardware developers indeed run their own machines. \n\nBut no, it's not the exact same model. There still is some room for selling hardware because hardware manufacturers might not be good at running the hardware, maintaining it, getting access to cheap electricity etc. That's why instead of bearing the risk of all those factors, they simply sell the hardware and focus on their core competency: manufacturing.\n\nBut none of that applies for cloud mining because it includes all costs already. They do maintenance, get the cheapest electricity, get the cheapest hardware, and then obviously make a profit, to then give that profit away is silly. They either run unprofitable machines that you pay for, or they run profitable machines and keep the profits.": 1, "I can expect them to be profitable over time, otherwise they should liquidate their assets, return a fair share back to the people who own the now non re-sellable options (and the latter point is only because being able to re-sell your options is an option, otherwise they Cex could keep it all), and admit that they ran the company into insolvency.  \n.  \nAs I've said before, the only way that they are not a scam is if the overall trend is proft making, otherwise they are being scammy and dishonest with the people who own ghs.  \n.  \nAs I said though, if they were smart about it, and IMO the only ethical, and beneficially to them, customer friendly approach, would be to have their fee high enough to cover the down times so that the fee would go up to, but never exceed the payout per share. At worst, that means they would lose a little bit on blocks that took a long time to solve, and if they're honest that wouldn't be an issue since their trend would still be positive. At best they'd have a long run of good blocks and they'd end up with more profits that they could take while stile maintaining a cushion for bad runs.": 1, "I wouldn't because I know enough to know that the difficulty of mining increases, and historically so has the number of miners competing for blocks, which means that a miner (as in the machine) only gets less and less effective.  \n.  \nThe same can't be said for cloud mining. I realize that Cex has fixed costs, as well as the repeating costs that come with always having to buy new equipment. That being said though, if they are spending the fees keeping up, then the rewards should almost always, if not always, be enough to cover the costs plus their profit.  \n.  \nTo be clear, I mean over time, not in the short term, which is why they should be able to afford keeping fees below, or when they're on a bad streak, at, the block reward, since over time they should still come out ahead. Again, that is presuming that they are buying new hardware, setting everything right, and doing everything they can to maximize block rewards for their users.  \n.  \nEdit: To add something another comment made me think of, if in the long term they are losing money on each block, then they are insolvent and they can only survive as a ponzi scheme or by skimming off what little money the do get while keeping their customers in the red. In either case, they wouldn't get away with it forever if that were/became the case.": 1, "I agree they should make their costs (and thus their clients costs) clear. But you can't expect tney will magically always be profitable and competitive or else eat the loss for you. They don't control the price of bitcoin nor every other miner. By being a client who cloud mines you are taking the risk of loss associated with mining, not them. Thats why they are structured this way, so they make money from fees while their clients take the risks associated with mining. Welcome to those risks coming home to roost... they go along with the gains made from mining in the past. Cloud mining was always a dumb idea for a number of reasons imo. If mining was so profitable and risk free they would just do it themselves and not sell it to you for a fee.": 1, "Thanks for your response.  Are the miners at least profitable overall?  That would be horrible mismanagement if not.\n\nI still think that charging for non-profitable blocks is not inherently a scam, though there might be more customer friendly ways to assign the costs, like a fixed fee per block and taking on the variance themselves.\n\nHowever, from what you've said, they could be scamming on either the true hash rate or the maintenance costs.  It would seem a bit strange if the profitability declined sharply recently, since the network hashrate hasn't increased rapidly in the last couple months.  It's certainly possible people aren't getting the true hash power they pay for, since it's hard to monitor cloud mining - you'd need to know a lot about the total number of customers/hashing contracts that they probably won't provide, and even then they could likely skim some of the profits.\n\nIt is certainly good to be vigilant with these things; best of luck with your investigating.\n\nEdit: I guess you could compare your own supposed hash rate vs block shares to see if it's statistically near where it should be, though the mining company could begin stealing if luck was above average.  I'm not sure how maintenance fees are determined for the contracts, but if it's just determined by cex.io themselves, they certainly could be charging excessive maintenance fees to customers.\n\nEdit 2:  From a quick google search, looks like maintenance fees have been the same since September 23rd, which is pretty ridiculous since the network hashrate is up about 50-75% since then, and crypto hardware usually improves at a rapid rate:\n\nhttp://blog.cex.io/news/cex-io-lowers-maintenance-cost/\n\nhttps://cex.io/maintenance\n\nEdit 3: If my numbers are right, it looks like that maintenance fee might be too high to make a profit at the current market cap.  Profitability per GHS/month:\n\n1 GHS/333,000,000 GHS * 30 days/month * 24 hours/day * 60 mins/hour * 1 block/9 minutes * 25 btc/block * $272/bitcoin = 9.8 cents (per GHS/month)\n\nBut the fee is 10.5 cents per GHS/month\n\nSo yeah, if it was stated or implied that the company would keep their mining hardware and maintenance fees competitive, it does appear that miners are getting screwed over here.": 1, "I don't know how their contracts work but I would assume a contract is for specific hardware and if you want newer hardware you have to change contract. But from what you say it sounds like the contract say they will upgrade the hardware during the contract.

If your pool is unlucky, you make less money.  If it's lucky, you make more money.  If you're really unlucky, you actually lose money due to electricity, at least in the short term.  It averages out.\n\nLast I checked, cex.io cloud mining prices were a ripoff anyway though, so it's not surprising that someone purchasing it would be a bit math-impaired.\n\nCan't fault OP for his good intentions, but there are plenty of real scams to focus on (and other problems with cex.io, but this isn't one of them).": 2, ">But underneath all of that, there's a simple model I described above and this model says that generally investing in cloud mining isn't going to earn you any money.\n\nYou model says that generally investing in mining at all isn't going to earn you any money because it's the exact same model for selling mining hardware.": 0, "In short, what you're saying is that cloud miners are paying good money for old hardware.\n\nUnless vendor tells you exactly what the expected energy efficiency is, you have no way to estimate the running costs.\n\nI remember reading about a prominent Bitcoin company that began mining in early-mid 2014. They broke even in about four months and reported that they were selling obsolete hardware to cloud miners.\n\nI had estimated that they were paying 9-10 cents per kWh, so if they weren't able to squeeze a profit out, I have no idea who would.\n\nThe take-away is that if they won't tell you the operating costs, don't give them your money.": 2}, ('Does the government mine BTC?', 1): {"A supercomputer is just a computer, just really fast.\n\nA computer is a general purpose device.

Of course a government could develop or purchase ASICs if it wanted to mine.\n\n>If the government is, rightfully, so fearful of the power of BTC, then wouldn't they also benefit from controlling a portion of the market?\n\nI don't know if they are fearful, but they have the same incentives to participate in mining as anyone else.  If a government sees value in the Bitcoin network, then it follows that they don't want anyone else achieving a mining majority.

But this is hardly a bigger requirement IMHO\n\nGenerally speaking, a color kernel can be updated in a safe way: you just need to be sure that the old kernel won\'t misinterpret the data.\n\nOne way to do this is to add a protocol version as a transaction meta-data, in some way. So a client which only understands protocol v.1 sees a v.2 transaction, it should be assume that all outputs have undefined or null colorvalue. While a newer client will be able to understand both v.1 and v.2 transactions. So if somebody runs an old client, he will just receive a warning message.\n\nBut this isn\'t specific to "functional colored coins".\n\nI think it might be a good idea to define a VM in a formal way, and implement a color kernel in terms of it. Then there will be no ambiguity in color kernel specification, and you also get an ability to import different kernels with different logic.': 2, "> settlements are not recorded, but are a function of the current consensus\n\nHow do you upgrade a color kernel if there's a bug?  Does everyone always have to be running the exact same software to agree on what value the color kernel outputs?": 1, 'More discussion in preceding paragraphs:\n\nThus we have a hybrid consensus system, which combines several different consensus mechanisms:\n\n1. there is a strong cryptographic consensus over the colorvalue-function of Alice\'s output\n2. there is a Bitcoin blockchain-based consensus over who currently owns that output\n3. there is a trust-based consensus over the variables which are used in the function\n\nI think it\'s obvious that this hybrid system has benefits over centralized trust-based systems: we only need to trust a data feed, and only to a limited extent.\nA data feed doesn\'t have a power to block anyone\'s transactions, or charge fees, or discriminate different agents.\nA big part of the system is fully decentralized (as decentralized as Bitcoin), and thus has all the benefits of a decentralized system:\nWe do not have a single point of failure (if data feed is temporarily down, transaction can still be made, that will only delay "settlements").\nIf the data feed goes down, clients might elect another data feed, they just need a consensus over what data feed to use.\nFinally, if a data feed becomes malicious (publishes wrong data, or a  different data to different actors), clients might choose to elect a different data feed.\nAs settlements are not recorded in the blockchain, but are a function of the current consensus, the situation can be remedied even after a data feed publishes erroneous data: clients can undo the damage as soon as they discover the error and switch to the correct data. Thus the system can be robust to a very large degree.\n\nIt\'s also worth noting that we can use arbitrary consensus mechanisms on the third layer, not just simple trust-based ones.\nE.g. there might be a network of trusted oracles which will make sure that everyone has the same view over what data was published.\nOr there might be some kind of a Byzantine Fault Tolerant network, or a network based on a Ripple-style consensus.\nAt this point we are only describing a framework within which different consensus mechanism can be combined.\n\n(A blockchain-based consensus is possible too, e.g. client might scan the blockchain for the executed trades to find the price which is used for CFD/NDF settlements, and thus achieve functionality similar to that of Counterparty.)\n': 1, "However, this doesn't mean that one must ditch the colored coins model to implement complex smart contracts. \n\n...\n\nLet's summarize what we've got so far:\n\n 1. We introduced a level of indirection: instead of getting a monetary value of an output directly, we get a function which yields a monetary value once the data is provided.\n 2. A color kernel might work with functions instead of scalar values: it will receive input colorvalue-functions and will transform them into output colorvalue-functions according to the data embedded into the transaction.\n 3. In order to achieve a global law of conservation (we do not want issuer's liability to depend on the contracts which are created by users among each other, i.e. users shouldn't be able to create more money for themselves), it is enough to ensure that the law of conservation is enforced by the color kernel, i.e. it checks that the value of output colorvalue-functions equals to value of input colorvalue-functions for all values of free variables.\n 4. We get to the actual monetary values using a secondary consensus system, which can be arbitrary: based on trust, BFT-systems, blockchain-based, etc.\n\n": 1, 'TL;DR?': 2}, ("[Meta] European banks require AV, Updates and clean PC's to get reimbursed in case of fraud.
