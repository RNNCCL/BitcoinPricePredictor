They will be voted on by the State Assembly and Legislature, as is consistent with the structure of our society.': 1, "1) The law does not need to articulate the State interest in its copy, rather they would only need to articulate the interest when defending it in Court. More so, this is also a draft regulatory framework, and if submitted for voting and enactment would likely be accompanied by a preamble which would explain the drafter's intent. This Press Release could even be used in court: http://www.dfs.ny.gov/about/press2014/pr1407171.html. Even if they did not, a statement in Court as easy as, preserving tax revenue, and thus the State's ability to exist would fly. They could also note the Federal Governments lack of policy and law as a reason for their own actions, and state they would happily subserve their law to whatever the Federal Government ends up doing (Federal Supremacy / Pre-emption, which is not the same as the DCC).\n\n2) The author does not address all of the potential state interests, or the possible effects related to that State interest. Consumer protection in is one vague one, but he doesn't even make a compelling argument for that. For example, are there any FDIC insured Bitcoin banks? What FinCen restrictions would be necessary to get one? Just the idea of depositors having no recourse to recover their funds would be enough of a consumer protection argument that the restrictions created by BitLicense could be argued to address this issue specifically.\n\n3) It does not harm interstate commerce. It may harm interstate commerce via Bitcoin. This is an important distinction to understand. Under this theory, a State would not be able to regulate basically anything coming in and out of it, ie, gun sales. The author needs to make a better argument here.\n\n4) Something is not unconstitutional until the US Supreme Court says so. You may think it is, or is likely to be, or could be, or in your opinion is, but to say it is, indicates a lack of understanding about the US judicial system and invites people to ridicule your ignorance and not take your position seriously.\n\n5) The way one objects to a law as unconstitutional is for it to be passed, and then for one to file suit and eventually have it overturned. An argument to something being unconstitutional is not actually a valid reason for a State not to pass it. You need to argue against the State's internal reasons for wanting to do so. People will want to pass BitLicense regardless of whether or not it gets overturned in a few years.\n\nThis is a good attention grabbing headline, but it doesn't hold water, and likely, a Court would uphold the majority of the BitLicense framework. If there are specific clauses with specific issues, I think that would be a stronger approach to challenge.\n\n*Edit: A funny thought I had while responding to some people here, is that complaints about BitLicense are often phrased like, hey, one little State in the US might set the standard in a fairly pro-regulatory fashion for the rest of the world; but they forget the reason why this might be a model which gets followed, that NYS has a GDP of $1.1 trillion, add in CT, NJ, you get another $800, PA and MA, another $1 trillion. There is a lot of money here, and a lot of advanced technical consumers. The real fear is not what BitLicense would do to Bitcoin, because frankly, I don't see it as that negatively overreaching given it applies only to companies who want to act in NY or with NY customers and even more so because of its similarities to current banking law (and that I don't think banks are regulated enough), but a realization that if you're a foreign entity and you don't comply with BitLicense, you'll lose out on a massive part of your market before it even gets started\xe2\x80\x94 people internationally were salivating over the low barriers to entry in the US market of Bitcoin vs. traditional banking but sometimes there's good reason for a barrier to entry. People need to stop treating the NYS government like it is some lowly sub-entity of the US, or a naive child, and realize that it is fucking powerful, and in the world of finance, there are maybe only a handful of other entities which can play with it. It has its own powerful lawyers who will scrutinize the legal ramifications and there really is a vested interest in protecting New Yorkers and their money from the rest of the world.

While the DCC forbids states from discriminating against foreign state traffic, and forbids states from setting and enforcing nationwide economic policy -- e.g., Texas tries to prosecute the sale of securities in New York by a Delaware corporation -- [it does NOT forbid states from setting intrastate policy.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dormant_Commerce_Clause#Health_and_safety_regulation)\n\nTo the contrary, state-level "blue sky" laws have regulated intrastate securities transactions since the early 1900s and, except where preempted by the Securities and Exchange Acts, continue to do so. More on preemption later. \n\nMy understanding of the DFS proposal is that it would require licensing for vendors who wish to sell/trade/etc. virtual currencies to/with/etc. New York state residents. I have a hard time differentiating that from the Martin Act -- the New York act that prohibits securities fraud -- or from any of the various statutes under which DFS licenses other financial actors, like mortgage brokers and banks. \n\nThe article owes its superficial appeal to its conflation of the Dormant Commerce Clause with the doctrine of preemption, under which state regulation is overriden by contradictory federal regulation. The DCC is not a placeholder, and does not preserve the status quo for eventual preemption. It does not say, "the federal government might act, therefore the states may not yet."

I can say this about my personal perspective............it\'s the exchange in any network that creates value.  Gold is worthless unless you exchange it for something to eat or something you need.   The gold has no intrinsic value other than it can buy me a chicken. Money is only what money does.   The value of a network only goes up due to exchanges of money for goods and services.    Our bitcoin economy would be much better off if the liquidity was driven from the exchange of bitcoins for goods and services not exchanging bitcoins for fiat back and forth with a bot trader trying to scalp .oo1% gains.  \n\nHoarding coins is fine.......but if you want to help do the following. Lets say your hoarding 10 coins.....buy one additional coin....spend it, then buy it back again and spend it again......do this 10 times.  Now you have "spent" your whole horde without even touching it.    If everyone with 10 coins or less did this the value of the network would go up,  if people who had more than 10 coins should just still try and do this small thing.  Spend 1 coin 10 times a month.  If we all did this,  spent one coin 10 times a month the value of the network would go up.   This is adding real value to the network,  not "hope fear and greed" value but real sort of GDP type value to the market.....': 2, "Well, first off, if you have an education in working hard, then you're doing better than most people. You can spend hours on YouTube hearing about the plight of people who went to respectable universities, only to graduate with zero job prospects, other than as a barista, and $100k+ in student loan debt. So in my book, you've got plenty of credibility.  \n  \nWhat you described in the second paragraph is spot on. Keeping your own stash at the same level, while spending bitcoins, has a net-zero effect on price (since the amount you are supplying and demanding is equal), but a net-positive affect on uptake, since you are expanding the network of bitcoin transactions.  \n  \nMy point was that it is important to acknowledge the role of saving (hoarding) in the economy. The reality is that saving has a set of very positive effects: It decreases the supply of bitcoins, making them more valuable for everybody else, it generates more trust, as others see that people are willing to hold large amount of their personal wealth in magical internet space bucks, and it allows the accumulation of capital, which can be borrowed or spent at some point in the future, sacrificing consumption today for the promise of greater consumption tomorrow.  \n  \nIf you want to engage in a large capital expenditure, such as building a new high rise, then somebody has to save the money first (at least in theory. It's not really the case with fractional reserve banking, but let's ignore that for a moment). Often this takes time, and seems pointless. Why would somebody just stack gold bars over the course of 40 years?  \n  \nAgain, with your second paragraph, I don't think we are actually in much disagreement. I've been buying, saving, investing, and spending bitcoins for a long time. My only point was to give the savers a little love, since they are the ones who beef up the value of everybody else's coins, paving the way for larger purchases in the future.": 1, 'Absolutely agree.

I offer it on my website and I get about 75 people to my site per day,  I sell about 10 or 15 jobs per day, and for the past 10 months I have had no one willing to pay with bitcoins.  Those who bought at 100, saw 1,000, now feel poor because it's not at all time highs,  and those who bought at 1,000 are now cut in half and don't want to lock in a loss.  \n\n(although locking in a loss could be a great way to cut your taxes this year,  and just buy back some other coins to hold, so lock in the loss this year,  take it as a loss on your taxes, then buy some different coins back to hold till later, a good tax strategy). \n\nso my frustration is that people are hoarding coins and we all need to spend some.  I have made a point to spend some coins this month.  I just spend some and buy them back right as I spend them.   we need to create some velocity of money. \n\n": 1, "I can see how holding back liquidity may push the price up, but the market needs liquidity, so by holding back liquidity the market will establish it another way,,,,,,,,,,,,,and in this case it will be rewarding trading, that trading will become speculative, and form a bubble.  \n\nReal liquidity is from trading of bitcoins for goods or service, not trading on a platform for speculation where market makers scalp the bid ask spread.

My viewpoint was pretty stationary. after reading what you said about capital I have changed my mind a bit, and that is what this process is for, I have expanded my understanding a bit. \n\nwhat your talking about is real "capital" creation.  It\'s a topic worth a 200 page paper on, but I agree that real "capital" (not what we have in the market place today with banks creating capital) is really a way for the government to dilute our hard earned and saved capital.  \n\nso with your words here I have learned.  I did understand what real capital is,  and I did understand that the FED has created a system of fake "Capital" creation.  I did not however put the pieces of the puzzle together in a way where the earning and saving of real bitcoin "capital" has a purpose.  \n\nmy gut feeling is that it\'s not fair to other holders of bitcoin, those who mined it or earned it, that I can take fake funny money dollars and buy real "capital" with it.  \n\nbut it\'s a free market, so if you mine it, or earn it and are willing to or have to sell it for fiat then thats fine.  \n\nbut damn.........I love bitcoin even more now, because when you buy a mined or earned bitcon it\'s real honest capital.   Capital in the true defenition of the word,  hard earned production saved in the form of capital.  \n\nI am so used to an economy where there is no real capital that I just didn\'t even think of that aspect of the bitcoin economy because in our economy there is no real capital and no reason to save.   \n\nso thank you,,,,,,,\n\nplease read this response to another reader that also sums up and makes a few points. \n\nThere are two sets of bitcoins, those horded that do nothing and those being curculated in the economy. Your converting their value into dollars and you don\'t even know it. Convert it into assets, example:\nIf you have 5 chickens worth of exchange and and 1,000 bitcoins participating in the economy, or you have 100,000 bitcoins in the economy. It doesn\'t matter the value of the whole network is 5 chickens. You keep trying to value it in dollars or bitcoins.\nBitcoins are only worth the total of the goods and services offered in exchange for them.\nit doesn\'t matter how many coins, or how many dollars, it only matters how many chickens.\nSo to spend bitcoins is to encourge the trading of goods and services for bitcoins, stimulating sellers of goods to accept bitcoins, and therefor increasing the value of the network or economy.\nThe money has no value, that is the medium of exchange, what creates the value is that people are willing to take your money for real goods and services.\nto increase the value of the bitcoins your holding by taking them out of the economy does nothing to help or hurt. the economy is worth what it\'s worth regardless of your coins being a part of it.\nwhat I am saying is that if you want to help,,,,,,spend some coins to encourage their acceptance and therefor increase the value of the network.\nagain...........your trying to argue that the value of each coin goes up if there is less supply...........but you can\'t value the money, you have to value only the goods in the market place offered in, and being traded in bitcoin.\n\n\n(so you can see that the point I was making doesn\'t value money, it only values goods, and I guess that is a view point taken from the fact that I produce goods and services as my income,  so I am talking my own book a bit.  It\'s hard to see bitcoin as capital,  but if your right, if bitcoins saved are real capital, real honest capital, then there is a window of time here where you can take fake funny money fiat, and buy real honest capital.............\n\nIf what your saying is true.......and it is..........then "saving capital" and "hoarding coins" are diffrent things.  Hoarding is the idea that the value will go up because you are limiting supply, and that is lame........but the idea that the money has a real value of the goods and services already traded, and that you are saving that value for future use, that is real capital and the buying opportunity is huge.     \n\nTo understand real capital is hard enough,,   to understand that bitcoin is real capital is almost of leap of faith,,,,but if you make that leap of faith you realize that bitcoin is soooo cheap.  SO very very cheap.  I mean like 1 million per coin would seem cheap. \n\nReal honest capital would change the world and encourage saving and investing and real risk to reward.  (the current risk to reward is fake because the capital is fake) \n\nmind blown.............................saving capital is different than hoarding based on greed or speculation.   The action may be the same but the intent is diffrent, and the emotional response to market price etc of the speculator will always hurt them.   Hoarding is an emotianal thing, where saving capital is a well thought out business decision based on risk and reward.  \n\n\n': 1, "So many fallacies in your response... no time to tackle them all.... \n\nCan you at least understand that hoarding increases the price of bitcoin (not in USD terms, but in material value terms) and we NEED at least a 10x - 1000x bigger market cap for Bitcoin in order to be able to trade bigger assets WITHOUT huge market price swings?\n\nPeople won't simply 'agree' to trade bitcoin at a bigger value because you wish it to be so. The market will set the price, and savers (holders) in bitcoin have a HUGE role in this!\n": 2, 'I agree..........all we can do is be an example and show people what amazing things honest money can do.   But to be an example one of the amazing things is to profit,  and to profit we must all exchange.  \n\nMy point is that if we speculate, and encourage speculation we create a bubble, and maybe a price bubble is inevitable,  but if we do our part to create the velocity of money,  real exchanges, those are what build network value.  \n\nSo my statement is that real network value is created from thin air when you exchange bitcoin for a good or service...........compared to an exchange of bitcoin for fiat, or a robot trading on an exchange scalping the bid ask spread. ': 1, "If everybody earned and spent Bitcoins, and nobody hoarded (saved) them, they would have no value. I'm detecting an Austrian worldview with a hint of Keynesian nonsense about how spending drives the economy.": 0, "There are two sets of bitcoins,  those horded that do nothing and those being curculated in the economy.  Your converting their value into dollars and you don't even know it.  Convert it into assets,  example:\n\nIf you have 5 chickens worth of exchange and and 1,000 bitcoins participating in the economy, or you have 100,000 bitcoins in the economy. It doesn't matter the value of the whole network is 5 chickens.    You keep trying to value it in dollars or bitcoins.  \n\nBitcoins are only worth the total of the goods and services offered in exchange for them. \n\nit doesn't matter how many coins, or how many dollars, it only matters how many chickens.   \n\nSo to spend bitcoins is to encourge the trading of goods and services for bitcoins, stimulating sellers of goods to accept bitcoins, and therefor increasing the value of the network or economy.  \n\nThe money has no value,  that is the medium of exchange,  what creates the value is that people are willing to take your money for real goods and services.  \n\nto increase the value of the bitcoins your holding by taking them out of the economy does nothing to help or hurt.   the economy is worth what it's worth regardless of your coins being a part of it.  \n\nwhat I am saying is that if you want to help,,,,,,spend some coins to encourage their acceptance and therefor increase the value of the network.  \n\nagain...........your trying to argue that the value of each coin goes up if there is less supply...........but you can't value the money, you have to value only the goods in the market place offered in, and being traded in bitcoin.   \n\n ": 1, 'I thought the idea was to do both - hoard to add value and spend to encourage uptake?   (spend and replace so your "hoard" is not diminished)': 2, 'Explain the value added to a network by holding................. The only real value you can add to a network is to exchange....when you exchange you trade up, and when you trade up you add value to the network.  \n\nExample.  You have a chicken that you perceive as worth 4.50 cents.  \nI have some chicken feed that I perceive a value of as 4.50 cents. \n\nThat network is worth 9 dollars.  \n\nWe agree to trade them,  we set a price of 5 dollars,  I sell you my chicken for 5 dollars and you sell me your feed for 5 dollars and the exchange takes place.  we both trade up and now the network is worth 10 dollars........a 10% gain.  (or close sorry math guys) \n\nOur current dollars system works the same way,  but the sales tax is about 7 to 10%, so the government takes the gains and the dollar network doesn\'t gain value.   They over tax it even more and the dollar networks shows a net loss for each transaction.  hence inflation. \n\nBitcoin is better than the dollar for this reason,  and to build the network all we have to do is exchange.    Hoarding effects supply, and supply may effect the fiat to bitcoin exchange rate.............but are you honestly so crazy that you want to earn dollars???    Who cares about dollars..............the goal is to build value in bitcoin and let the dollar die.    so while your motivated to horde and watch your bitcoins go up in value compared to a dieing currency those who actually participate in the market place are creating all the real value.    Speculators are along for the ride,  but only on the backs of us in the trenches working and earning and spending bitcoins.  \n\nso get off my back,  if your not earning, or spending bitcoins your a leach.   Forget dollars all together and just focus on building the network value by making exchanges.  \n\nProduction beats speculation,   your trying to "hold" value.     It\'s like comparing a bucket full of water compared to a water wheel using the stream of water to produce something.  The bucket of water can never outperform a water wheel that is using the flow of the river (economy) to produce energy.  Storing buckets of water have no value,  it\'s the movement of the river (economy) that produces the gain.  Stagnant water like stagnant bitcoins have no value gain,  and do nothing for the network value,  they ony effect the fiat exchange rate.....and if your here reading this then your obviously smart enough to know the dollar is dead.   Stop trying to get rich in dollars and start trying to get rich in productivity.  Only production is wealth.  \n\nbe productive,  that is the answer to everyone\'s "how can I get rich" question.

Here\'s one source:\n\nhttp://bitzuma.com/posts/six-things-bitcoin-users-should-know-about-private-keys/\n\nA public key is a 2D point on an elliptic curve. This point has x- and y-coordinates. Each coordinate requires 32 bytes, a really big number.\n\nIt turns out that cryptographic elliptic curves have a horizontal plane of symmetry. They\'re the same on the top and on the bottom. So the y-coordinate is actually not necessary. As long as I know if the point is above of below the plane, I can re-generate the y-coordinate.\n\nIt\'s not mathematically convenient to work with separate x- and y-coordinates, so they\'re concatenated together, giving a single, larger number.\n\nAn uncompressed public key uses both coordinates. That gives 2\\*32 = 64 bytes. An extra byte is tacked onto the beginning to indicate that both coordinates are being used. This gives 1 + 2\\*32 = 65 bytes. When written in "hex" form, this requires 2\\*65 = 130 characters.\n\nA compressed public key uses only the x-coordinate. That gives 1\\*32 = 32 bytes. An extra byte is tacked onto the beginning, and indicates whether the point is above or below the plane of symmetry. This gives 1 + 32 = 33 bytes. When written in hex form, this requires 2\\*33 = 66 characters.\n\nCompressed public keys can save you money in fees. Signing a transaction with a compressed public key makes a smaller (in terms of data) transaction. Fees are based on data size, so compressed public keys can reduce transaction fees:\n\nhttp://bitzuma.com/posts/making-sense-of-bitcoin-transaction-fees/\n\nAddresses are derived from public keys. The conversion is one-way.\n\nHex is a number system based on the number 16. For example, the decimal number 10 is written "a" in hex. The number 15 is "f".

The question is what probability of long term confirmation do you want?\n\nBitcoin nodes compare incoming transactions against their copy of the block chain *and* a memory pool of recently arrived transactions not yet in a block.  If the sending addresses have enough balance to make the transaction, and it passes other tests, it gets relayed to other nodes.  If it does not, it gets rejected.  This happens in a matter of seconds.  If you see an incoming transaction on your personal wallet, or on blockchain.info, you already have a ~99.99% confidence level the transaction is good, as long as you are not getting your info from the sender's node (which they can manipulate)\n\nIncorporation into a block, and then more blocks being created after it, just raises that probability higher.  If you run the canonical convenience store, zero confirmations is sufficient, because the amount is small, and you make lots of them in a day.  The savings over bank fees is much larger than the risk of a double-spend.\n\nIf your business is selling furniture, it will generally take more than an hour to deliver it, so you have plenty of time to get 6 confirmations.
