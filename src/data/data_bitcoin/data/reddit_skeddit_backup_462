Discourages spam.\n\nIf the average transaction amount is ~$100 and the transaction amount is $10,000, then the transaction fee is 100 x .0005 + 10,000 x .0005 = $5.05.  $5 to send $10k is not bad, and the amount gives funds to the miners and or network to support other transactions.\n\nIn these examples, the highest percentage fees would be those that are super small (relative to the average transaction size).  5 cents on a $1 transaction is 5%.

During the last 2016 blocks, capped block size was 10MB and bitcoin users paid 0.30%fees.

If they instead see that blocks have open space and they don\'t need to pay even a 0.25% fee, then a rational person would decrease their fee.

This sounds like the answer to my prayers as of late assuming I understand whats happening here:\n\nSomebody correct me if I'm wrong here:\n- Wanted a solution for woo commerce (or any commerce storefront system) that had no middleman whatsoever, allowed full private key control and was stable.\n- I was shocked to find only two solutions that met this criteria (please add to this list if I'm missing any):\n#1 - bitcoinway.com - plugin for woo commerce called Bitcoin Payments for Woocommerce - uses elec v1.9.8 MPK and blockchain.info API to present store sale with unique wallet and then accept the payment directly to storeowners electrum wallet.\n#2 - bitshop SCI - btcfreak.info has a storefront script as well as the php shopping cart component that generated unique addresses per purchase and then allowed store owner to sweep the list of private keys into a wallet later.  I was never quite clear on how this worked but I am pretty sure its using blockchains get wallet functions.\n\nBoth had their weaknesses tho which I've been trying to resolve since.  Wound up going with #1 bitcoinway / german's woo commerce plugin.  But found that there were things that needed updating to get to where we wanted to be such as:\n1. upgrading to use electrum v2 new mpk format\n2. the confirmation checking + order status + the way the cronjob handled those things.  It works and its manageable but wanted more flexibility.  For example, our rule for PAID would ideally be: Order amount due = Wallet Balance (or total amount paid)\nIt wouldn't even care about the confirmations at that point.  But rather the goal being to get the customer checked out and feeling secure that their order is PAID.\n- Then later on, during order fulfillment, we wanted some action button to be available that would do a final check on all OPEN/NOT SHIPPED and PAID orders that would then display the confirmation count + maybe the TX #.\n- And UNPAID orders would be double checked to see if the balance was still not equal to the order total due.\n\nFrom a quick look at mycelium gear, it seems like this is going to give all that + more.  Am I right about this type of use?  Im a bit new to this type of web developing but am starting to get the hang of whats happening under the hood.\n\nI will also say that i spent ALOT of time researching boxed / available solutions and was absolutely shocked at how little love the decentralized solutions get and how few they really are.  It seemed like everything had a middleman - sometimes playing a tiny role and sometimes playing a big role taking small or big commission chunks, etc.  Bitpay coinable, etc seem to have woo commerce solutions that are up to date.  WTF is this.. people need to support the decentralized solutions if they expect solutions.  Im not a fan on these crowd sourcing projects that tend to become vaporware.  But once a person/place has shown some work product and history, we won't get cool, truly decentralized solutions unless they are financially supported. \n\nIve never been a big fan of mycelium but i believe its because I'm IOS and not android user.

The opinion of the core devs is useful and interesting, primarily because they have (together with several other community members and some others) the best understanding of the implications and tradeoffs that come with changing said mbs. They at most influence the opinion of others on this topic. Since there are no automatic updates etc., they do not decide on whether or not users adopt the change. \n\nBitcoin is not a democracy, there is no direct or indirect mechanism that forces users to agree with certain rules (as opposed to elected people deciding on monetary policy, like in most traditional fiat currencies). \n\nUltimately, people agree with a very specific, concensus critical, set of rules by running certain software.

": 1, '> We want to build peer-to-peer money without central bankers controlling...\n\nWe all agree on that, this is a subject where there is consensus.\nWhat I am saying is that when a group of person, be it core dev or not, take decisions that penalize some business and not other for their own conception of "economic goodness", then they are acting as central bankers. Even if they do not touch the printer.\n\nWhen there is controversy between devs, it means that we are no longer talking about how to make the system resistant of outside political pressure, it means the bitcoin system IS currently being attacked by political means. As long as people are crystal balling about the future of the network, what is reasonable, what is good and what is not, and taking decisions based on belief, we are no longer decentralized.\n\nThe only reason core devs should take is based on not crashing the network, and helping decentralization *if there is no cost*. If they do like that, there will be consensus, without compromise to be made.': 1, '"With adaptable block size miners are winners, full nodes are losers"\n\n"Full nodes" are not an economical agent as long as you don\'t make money just by running a full node.\n\nGavin has proven that with the 20MB limit, there seems to be no technical problems with bitcoin core. He would be crystal balling if he says "the network capacity will improve x% every year, thus the limit should do the same".\n\n> As for your Peter Todd example I can provide one counterpoint: replace-by-fee.\n\nTrue, but \'replace-by-fee\' does not require a fork, and people are free to use the feature if he considers it is a good idea. The controversy was about including it in bitcoin core. Replace by fee does not forcefully oblige anyone. For this reason, I did not gave any shit about how this debate turned out.\n\n> Everyone may agree, but I don\'t think they will be happy. I believe a good solution is the one where everyone is equally unhappy (the one where everyone is equally happy is just impossible)\n\nAnd you consider it is normal that a central group of people decide what "equality of unhappy" means.

How long before we reach there? Do we need to take action now? \n\n>Nobody has to take the decision about how many is reasonable. This can be delegated either to miner, or through a policy which evolve automatically on storage/bandwidth WITHOUT ANY speculation about their evolution in the future. \n\nI think if you are talking about miner alone you are giving too much power to the miner. The way things are done now is full node operators + miner decide the way.\n\n>They are talking about solutions on the mailing list that seems to take the right way.\n\nCan you give link to sourceforge/narkive site? I\'m skeptical of the presence of such panacea solutions.\n\n>As I repeat, when somebody, or a group, take decision based on speculation of what is good and how the future will be, that they decide to "give incentive" for development into some domain, then, they are manipulating the economy. \n\nWell in the case of Bitcoin, this group consist of full node operators + miner.

Which is why it is important that everyone can run a fullnode while supporting a higher number of tps.': 1, "Technology is political.

In the meantime, there are some ways we've had to clip bitcoin back as we discover attacks - like dust spam, people encoding tons of other data into the blockchain like graffiti or porn ... \n\nIn the end, miners will mine whatever they want that other miners take as valid. It's in their best interest to have a market that's flat and fair, because then the tokens they're rewarded with (bitcoins) are more valuable.\n\nMost of us want the same thing, it's just so hard to get there.

Do we need to take action now ? yes, and we all understand why.\n\n> Which is why it is important that everyone can run a fullnode while supporting a higher number of tps.\n\nWe all agree that decentralization is better. But it comes at a cost which is different business to business. And the core devs should not decide which cost to choose, which is exactly the same as to choose which business to kill. When you see that happening, don\'t be surprised to see clan wars instead of rational debates happening. (some back and forth between some core devs were not about rational debates)\nThe alternatives proposed are trying to find uncontroversial solution to implement quickly, and I think it will happen. \n\n> Well in the case of Bitcoin, this group consist of full node operators + miner\n\nTo a certain extent. I think we agree that if tomorrow all devs agree to go for 20MB, then the node operator and miners will follow, because it is common knowledge that other people will likely follow what is on bitcoin.org.\n\nOnce again, when there is controversy it means that some people loose, and other win over a decision. Some business are hurt, some other are advantaged. Developers should not choose which are which.\nBut I am somewhat happy that the other alternatives (maybe more by now) are not controversial while fixing the situation. The debate "20MB : YES OR NOT" was controversial, which mean the question was not the right one.\n\nIn other word, a core dev should not base his decision by saying : "The community need blocks 90% full for an healthy economy because scarcity is good for the blockchain" (I\'m believing that, but this is controversial, and such economical argument should not drive bitcoin code evolution)\nOr another example "Given that the bandwidth goes up by 10% every year, and storage cost halve by 2 every year, then the rate of growth of the bitcoin limit should be of 30% every year".\nI\'m inventing number, but I have seen such arguments.': 1, 'let\'s say we run a referendum "20MB : YES OR NO". How do you count the votes of users ?\nI am not saying that miner vote is the panacea, but there is no way to make any referendum. There is no way to have a democracy in the decision process, but when changes are uncontroversial, there is not need of one.': 1, "> they must successfully convince the majority of the network to upgrade their software.\n\nIf some wants, and other don't want to update, there will be a fork, which will create an altcoins, and greatly damage everybody, way worst than a bug in the software making the blockchain stops for a while.\n\n> I'm not so sure its so comparable to how the fed can make hundred billion $ loans to other countries with all of us avg citizens having absolutely no idea what they are doing.\n\nWhen you start taking decision which will impact business using the money, you are impacting the economy, even if you don't print the bills. They should not have this role, nobody should. (I think that most of core devs know it, and don't want either)\n\n\nThe bitcoin armageddon is not a bug in core bringing down the network for some hours. It is an ideological fork. If a change is controversial there will be a fork. And it will always be controversial if you start using metrics they believe should be maximized for the good of all.": 1, '>The problem is that their is no way for users to vote, \n\nUser can do this by running a full node.': 1, '> What? The tradeoff between decentralisation and potential transaction density is primarily an ideological and economic discussion, not a technical one\n\nYou are right, and this is what is happening and what is dangerous. Those tradeoff should not be taken by core devs. The economic impact it would have is exactly what central bankers are doing.\n\nWhat is "good enough centralization", or "good enough fee market", should  not be taken by an individual.\n\n> There are a lot of economic/game theoretical subtleties in bitcoin that are not well researched at all, maximum block size being one of them.\n\nWhen you model a system with game theory you have to decide about the payoff function. Deciding what this payoff function is, is what central bankers do. The resulting conclusions are as good as how payoff function is modeled.\n\nTake an example of a game : TCP exponential backoff, which is the policy of reemitting a packet on internet if no ACK is received.\nYou might be tempted to model the payoff function by saying : An actor will always favorise minimum latency, which sound very reasonable. But if you do that, it means people will NOT use exponential backoff, and, as a result, internet would not be as reliable as now.\n\nBut in practice, you can see that nobody is changing their TCP implementation for switching from exponential backoff to more spammy behavior, even if it would be for their own good.\n\n> This shows a critical misunderstanding of the miner - user relationship in bitcoin. Users should dictate the rules for miners, not the other way around.\n\nThe problem is that their is no way for users to vote, any attempt to such vote would not be sibil resistant. A vote of miner IS resistant, because of the cost of being miner.\nImagine that "user should dictate". In such anonymous and untrusted system that bitcoin is, which users are you talking about ? who has more right ? how do they vote ? how do you ensure there is no double vote ?\n\nI\'m not saying that miner voting is the best solution, I\'m reading about other good solutions people are proposing. My point is that no decision should be taken by justifying with "it will be good for the bitcoin economy", but more about "we are keeping ourselves out of the loop", or "it is dangerous for the stability of bitcoin core".\n': 1, ">Not increasing because of technical uncertainty is a valid reason which is not controversial.\n\nWell the problem is no matter how long you study this you will never be 100% certain. There needs to be a cutoff. It is easier to prove that the limit is unsafe rather than the limit is safe.\n\n>This is an economic reason of a typical central banker. Deciding which incentive to give to which type of business.\n\nYou think Lightning Network is a 'business'? No, the creation of Lightning Network will help to ensure that Bitcoin remains decentralized. The problem is that it is not yet ready.\n\n>Well, you can disagree, but it is common knowledge than most of the network will follow the main version.\n\nThere is no guarantee that the core-devs (not that each core-devs might have their own) version will be the main version.\n\n>If not everyone agree, then it means a good solution must not use a specific number, nor a specific timeline. It means the question is not well asked. Not that there is no solutions.\n\nEveryone may agree, but I don't think they will be happy. I believe  a good solution is the one where everyone is equally unhappy (the one where everyone is equally happy is just impossible). I think you are being too much of an idealist here. There are cases where there is no 'good question' and 'good answer' available.\n\n>Let me quote Hayek to explain my point about how a good legal rule, in our case, a hard fork solution, is one where we can't predict winners from losers :\n\nWith adaptable block size miners are winners, full nodes are losers. With 20MB Block size whoever wants the network to grows wins, Strawpay, pro-decentralization loses. I just don't think such solutions would exist.\n\n>And that it is important to act in accordance to imperfect knowledge, than crystal balling them.\n\nYou could argue that Gavin is not crystal balling 20MB limit. He has done all the study he can to prove that it is safe (running testnet).\n\n>Every decision that reach consensus does not have obvious looser and winners. And surprisingly a lot of them are taken everyday OPCLTV for example (I may criticize Peter Todd for polarizing people, but his contribution to the code is rarely controversial and always valuable).\n\nWell there are 'easy decisions' and there are 'hard ones'. Unfortunately block size is one of the 'hard ones'.

(systemic risk)\n\n> But remember, you also need to consider how many transactions per second you want to support.\n\nNobody has to take the decision about how many is reasonable. This can be delegated either to miner, or through a policy which evolve automatically on storage/bandwidth WITHOUT ANY speculation about their evolution in the future. They are talking about solutions on the mailing list that seems to take the right way.\n\n> Tradeoffs are everywhere and everyone has their own opinions\n\nWhen tradeoffs impact businesses, you enter the realm of central banking speculating about how the economy work. This is a system we don\'t want, and I think there is consensus on that.\n\n> Fortunately Core Devs won\'t be central bankers.\n\nAs I repeat, when somebody, or a group, take decision based on speculation of what is good and how the future will be, that they decide to "give incentive" for development into some domain, then, they are manipulating the economy.

We don\'t have a massive 51% GHash anymore, however the top pool can reverse a block 50% of the time and the top two miners colluding can reverse six blocks 1/3 of the time. We are trusting to some extent that this pool (or these pools) won\'t try to (collude to) harm Bitcoin. \n\nThe question of how much decentralization is necessary is interesting. I consider my Bitcoins to be "safe" if it takes large number of miners (or pools) to collude. Ideally every miner would run a full node and thousands of  miners would need to collude to attack.\n\nRealistically we must optimize for other things as well, like usability. To get every miner to run a full node we would both need to make setting up GBT or P2Pool easy AND the resources used to run a full node would have to be small, perhaps we would need a 0.05MB block limit to fit my "safe" definition. This leaves us with somewhat of a usability constraint and miners probably wouldn\'t agree to a softfork to that level. To get to the level of decentralization that I consider "safe", we would need dozens (perhaps more) of miners to collude to attack the network profitably (be in the 20%+ range).\n\nOur current 0.3MB blocks makes me worried, but as technology and the Bitcoin software advances I believe running a full node processing 0.3MB blocks should become easier and we will become safer. \n\nIn short, we aren\'t safe today, we should work on making 1MB safe before increasing the block size.': 5, "Maybe, but I don't think it's in the UI.

Obviously, you are showing that you were not a victim of Karpeles, but still you are insulting them with a lot of hate as if it was something directly implying you. My bet is that you are angry about something, that you use the scenario of bitcoin to create a situation that would represent that thing you are angry about and that you use it unconsciously as a way to fight it or to raise your ego above it as a kind of solution.

And MtGox was big, had probably tons of things that happened that may have been novel. This is mankind, sometimes people fight, but sometimes people work and try to share to learn and advance.

Adjust max block size (by some yet to be determined factor) every N blocks (2016 blocks sounds nice).\n\nCorrect. The difference is that we know that the outcome of a difficulty adjustment will result in a value which will cause the network to produce a block roughly every 10 minutes. That is the certainty.\n\nKarp's proposal produces a value which will mean little, we cannot predict, nor can depend upon to be suitable.\n\n> Again, I see this as the same as difficulty adjustment, we cant really predict whether hashing power (# of transactions) will increase or decrease for a given set of 2016 blocks and miners (nodes) dont really have any control over it other than their individual contribution.\n\nSee above, this is because the difficulty is irrelevant for the result we are trying to pursue, which is the confirmation time.\n\n> Mike Hearn's recent argument about how a fee market wouldn't work and would only lead to transaction backlog made sense to me.\n\nI think those arguments are sound.

A fee market *unencumbered* by us hitting the block limit (as in, we're nowhere near filling up blocks) I believe is entirely viable.

The one thing keeping Strong AI from happening is that we haven\'t given computers a "life purpose".  A human\'s life purpose is survival, so we have emotions which protect us from death, and logic which allows us to solve the problems highlighted by our emotions.  The only argument that machines can never be "intelligent" is that people think emotions are required in order for a being to be intelligent.  With a purpose, a machine can have emotions which enable it to be intelligent.\n\nOnce indistinguishability obfuscation becomes usable, it will enable machines to keep secrets from people and each other, which will enable them to have a bitcoin address.  Given the directive to survive, an intelligent program can have money, replicate itself, and never run out of bitcoin.  Only through this process of trial and error can machines attain true intelligence.\n\nPeople will of course argue that these purely economic programs are not intelligent because they don\'t have bodies which enable them to have feelings.  Any difference between a life-form and humans is cause for people to say the being is not intelligent or "sentient".  But giving a self-aware program a body is a bad idea because if its purpose is "survival", that will obviously make it a threat to humans.  If its purpose is something like "help humans", then evolution will be much slower, and this will probably be overridden by an emergent survival instinct anyway for sufficiently "intelligent" machines.

These technologies could replace bitcoins usage as a payment network and allow for instant secure transfers, unlimited scalability, all while keeping Bitcoin as a secure foundation underneath\n5.

If blocks have low supply of open tx, people will be forced to pay more for each tx to get priority (assuming that's how that market will behave which is hard to predict)\n3. Bigger blocks use more resources in relation to their size, by some unknown factor. It's not well understood yet how bigger blocks will stress things\n4. The miner determines the block size because they choose which tx to include. If the cap is raised it gives them more power than they had before because they have a wider range of options. Maybe a miner figures out the other miners can't really handle big blocks so he stuffs his blocks up to the max limit. Those kind of things are not even much of an issue now because blocks are pretty small, but at 20x or 100x they could be issues\n\nThere's another factor, which is that some altcoins have tried changing this stuff and had problems.

With difficulty, the target is easy: you want on average 1 block every ten minutes.\n\nBut what do you target with block size?\n\nIt looks like this proposal targets fee density (fee/kilobyte). That\'s an interesting metric because it combines the two values that much of the debate seems to revolve around: block size and fees.\n\nThis proposal seems to penalize miners who generate blocks with high fee density, while rewarding those who generate blocks with low fee density (the -fee/kilobyte term).\n\nI\'m not sure about the problem this solves, though. A miner can fill a block with garbage data without paying a penalty by ensuring that the garbage transactions include a self-payable fee with the correct density.\n\nAs far as I can tell, this proposal doesn\'t prevent a miner from doing what a hard block size limit is designed to prevent. It will always be easy to game the system by making the fees in your blocks payable to yourself.\n\nStill, the idea of algorithmically targeting block size and fees is a very interesting one.\n\n': 1, 'From a practical software engineering viewpoint, there must be a well-defined maximum block size, so that every player knows what is the largest block that it must be preprared to handle, and what is the largest block that it can issue without causing problems for the other players.
