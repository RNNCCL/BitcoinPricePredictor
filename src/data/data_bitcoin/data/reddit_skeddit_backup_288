We've had distributed databases for 50 years and this is nothing different. No immutable time stamping. No inherent value associated with the token, just IOU's.  \n": 8, "Then it's nothing more than a blockchain of contracts. In the end they need to settle for the real thing.": 1, 'In the current monetary system, central banks operate as primitive blockchains. Effectively, a central bank provides a "shared database" so that commercial banks can settle accounts between one another. Furthermore, the units of account used by central banks are traditionally known as "cash," which is analogous to the units of account used in blockchains in that direct ownership of these units is possible (which is why bitcoin is sometimes explained as "digital cash").  \n\nWhen a money can be directly owned, it becomes the base money of the monetary system built around it. Contemporary monetary systems are vast systems built, ultimately, around cash which can be directly owned. When a money cannot be directly owned, it becomes "credit." The difference between a blockchain and a database is the difference between money and credit. \n\nIt is having the power of being the sole issuer of the base currency, of the form of money that can be directly owned, that gives central banks their power. It is due to this power that central banks end up becoming the clearing house and settlement layer of interbank settlements, and it is in having the power to set the price of base money, as well as controlling its supply, that allows them to set interest rates. You take base money out of the equation, central banks become just another bank. \n\nThe problem central banks face today is that cash, the base money around which modern monetary systems are built, is rapidly losing its utility and value in the digital age. Not only are people not using it as much, but after QE commercial banks are swimming in so much of it (technically, central bank reserves) that they never really need to borrow more. (For the Fed to raise interest rates, assuming it even wants to, it can no longer just use the traditional tools, it now will have to actually borrow money from non-bank financial institutions and pay them interest on the loan in order to bring up the base rate.) So there is a crisis with base money, there is too much of it and people don\'t want it anyway.  \n\nFurthermore, if banks are intent on creating a blockchain to provide interbank settlements, they will no longer use central banks to settle accounts. If they no longer use central banks to settle accounts, then central bank money only has special value in that cash can be directly owned/possessed and therefore commercial banks require cash to pay customers who wish to make withdrawals. But as cash is made out of paper and is not suited for the digital age, people are using it less and less and withdrawals becoming more and more rare.\n\nPut simply, the blockchain used as a settlement layer for the banks will ultimately end up replacing central banks\' role as settlement layer for commercial banks and thus the units used in conjunction with the blockchain will replace the need for central bank reserves. Consequently, whoever controls the issuance of this money will control the monetary system.\n\nIf these international bankers are talking about using a new currency with the blockchain they intend to use as a interbank settlement layer, call it \'bankcoin,\' then bankcoin -- a non-national currency issued by bankers -- is really poised to become a new world reserve currency.\n\nUltimately what makes Bitcoin special and unique over its competitors, whether it be Bankcoin or Ethereum, is that Bitcoin isn\'t controlled by anyone. It is the decentralized nature of Bitcoin that keeps it poised to compete as a global currency. As we transition into the 21st century, the role of money and power is going to get more and more tense. Throughout this tension, the currency that has no political allegiance, that is fair and free from central control, whether it be bitcoin or some other open currency, will be positioned to do well. \n': 6, "Andolfatto's response is typical of the complete ignorance of economists on this topic.

Could you have bitcoin disappear? Quite possibly"', 31): {'[deleted]': 1, 'New York-based R3, whose chief executive David Rutter is a former head of Icap\xe2\x80\x99s electronic broking business, on September 15 announced it was being backed by a consortium of banks including Barclays, BBVA, Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Credit Suisse, JP Morgan, State Street, Royal Bank of Scotland and UBS.\n\nRutter said: "I chose to start with the banks because they are the ultimate consumers. So it\'s like the way Boeing built the 787 \xe2\x80\x93 by talking to customers and airlines and stewards and stewardesses."\n\nR3 is working on developing commercial applications based on distributed ledger technology, of which blockchain is an example. FN discusses the consortium\'s plans.\n\nFinancial News: What is R3 trying to do?\n\nDavid Rutter: We are trying to build the first true financial-grade ledger that is fit for purpose for financial markets \xe2\x80\x93 strong enough, secure enough and [able] to handle hundreds of billions of transactions a day. We call it the \'fabric\', which is the foundational layer on which promising applications can be built on. Through collaboration we are also trying to bring efficiencies to the various experiments that R3 and its bank members have done. And then from that, using the intelligence gained from the proof of concepts and the lab experiments, we want to build commercial applications that solve some Wall Street problems or bring efficiencies to our members.\n\nHow will this interact with initiatives the banks are developing internally? For example UBS, an R3 partner, is building a utility settlement coin\xe2\x80\xa6\n\nUBS and other members are running their own experiments but they realise that a financial grade \'fabric\' does not yet exist. So they would work with us on developing that architecture. And then they would also share the learnings of their experiments with other members of R3. One of the main drivers for this early stage partnership is that the proof of concepts we are all working on independently are not things that can work in isolation. You need to have the industry get behind them. So if you have a promising use of the blockchain, in settlement for example, getting others involved is better.\n\nWhy has interest in the blockchain by banks exploded in recent months?\n\nI think that as banks have put more resources on it and spent more time experimenting with it, the value of shared distributed ledgers has become more apparent to those that have been at it longer. So I think that everyone feels that the probability of a shared distributed ledger solution bringing efficiencies to certain of Wall Street\'s processes is quite high and will invest in it.\n\nWhat are some of the areas that you believe are ripe for blockchain applications?\n\nJust in our working group alone we have framed out about a dozen possible solutions and what we hope to do is be intelligent about which ones we pursue in part by the information we gather in the second pillar of our business which is the lab environment. There is a lot of talk about clearing and settlement, and those cases are quite viable. Even the issuance of securities on the blockchain is viable. But I am cautious when I read other people make determinations about what the best use of the blockchain is at this early stage in the technology. That is one of the reasons why we have chosen intelligent collaboration over picking one thing.\n\nWhen might we expect blockchain being applied in mainstream finance?\n\nWe could in a year to two years\' time prove how the blockchain could replace certain processes and create significant savings for the industry and also be more secure and cut out on errors that exist today. But then rolling that out, replacing the current system, the migration that is required to do that is more of a multi-year thing.\n\nCould it just be a hype?\n\nI think there have been enough resources put in to this field that the chances of it being all hype are quite small. Could you have bitcoin disappear? Quite possibly. But I think it\'s unlikely that the bunch of smart guys that we have assembled to R3 with the group of banks can\'t come up with practical uses of this technology.\n\nDo you think that blockchain has the potential to make clearing houses and custodians irrelevant?\n\nIt has the potential to completely change the workflow and maybe even the value proposition of clearing houses and custodians. But I think that it would be na\xc3\xafve to think those entities that offer very valuable service go away with this technology \xe2\x80\x93 that is the kind of stuff that I hear more in California than in New York.\n\nSo are you reaching out to other market participants like clearing houses, which could lose out lot from this technology?\n\nWe have not reached out to them to date but we are keenly interested in working collaboratively and we want to help Wall Street evolve. It\'s an evolution not a revolution. So we are keen to work with all the participants but, as you must appreciate, a group of the biggest banks in the world is difficult enough so we plan on doing things incrementally.\n\nAre there actually enough people at the banks who know about this stuff?\n\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s grown very rapidly. As you would expect there are varying degrees of financial and human resource commitment at the various banks, but the ones that have signed up in this partnership are certainly keenly aware of the possibilities and have put resources aside.\n\nConsortia have often proved hard to manage. How do you make sure this one goes smoothly?\n\nI have been on the Street for 32 years, I\'ve run big businesses, I\'ve run start-ups and this is my fifth consortium, so I am keenly aware of the difficulties. But I am quite sure that both the contractual construct that we have agreed and the enthusiasm of the partners about the potential to save money in the financial sector, when it [has] never mattered more, all add to making it the right sauce at the right time.': 6, "I don't think you get what I'm saying.

The two projects are very different while both having the same goal of helping to scale Bitcoin and alleviate Blockchain bloat.  \nOpen Transactions/Stash will enable users to transfer value off-chain in an anonymous (untraceable cash) and safe (unforgeable reciepts) way.  The ledger for the transactions is very different than a blockchain in that it doesn't keep a history of all the transactions that have happened, it only keeps a record of the last receipt.  But because that last receipt cannot be forged by the server (it requires the user's signature, which it can't duplicate) the receipt is enough to have final settlement and maintain the proper balances of everyone's accounts.  The amazing thing is that they have figured out a way (through multi-sig voting pools) to enable bitcoins to flow in and out of the platform.  This means that bitcoin transactions can happen off-chain (faster, cheaper) and then be settled back on-chain when a person wants to remove the value to be completely under their control again.  \nThen Lightning Network on the other hand is attempting to keep everything on the Bitcoin network.  It relies on combining and routing thousands to millions of person to person transactions which have not yet been posted to the blockchain (but are valid and signed).  Basically, if A owes B 10 bitcoin, and B owes C 10 bitcoin, then A can just pay C the 10 bitcoin and all debts are settled.  They have users who are making a payment create transactions and sign them, and then wait to post them to the Bitcoin blockchain.   The transaction is then updated with a new transaction every time the user needs to pay for more stuff. The idea is that once you create and sign the transaction it is valid and can be posted for the amount which was signed at any time (so there is no risk to the original person being paid).  Once you have enough people participating in the network, the unposted transactions would have enough liquidity to route pretty much any kind of value you needed to send.  \nBoth approaches are interesting.  I'm fascinated to see how it all plays out.": 3, 'Seems interesting': 1, 'Super excited to see Chris Odom still working hard on the Open Transactions platform.
