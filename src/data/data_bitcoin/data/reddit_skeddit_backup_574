When will Bitcoin hit that limit?': 1}, ('Bitcoin Empowered Art', 6): {}, ('Bitcoin Discussions on Quora', 7): {}, ('How can Bitcoin be used by Urban populations?', 2): {'How did we forget remittances? Haha so many immigrants living in cities send money to their home countries': 1, 'The small corner stores and tiny bodegas can benefit from the reduced transaction fees, allowing the shop owners to keep more money in their pockets. \n\nAdditionally, keep this in mind. LibertyX is one of the easiest and safest ways to buy BTC using only cash in the US. You just walk into thousands of retailers across the country and buy BTC. No scheduling meetups. No risk of getting robbed by an unknown third party. No risk of the seller absconding with your cash. Within five minutes, you can start buying up to $2,500 per week. \n\nThis is particularly relevant to your essay because the retailers that sell LibertyX BTC are those commonly used by the unbanked population to pay utility bills. So one of the easiest ways to buy BTC in the US without a bank account already happens to be tightly integrated with the way the unbanked move money. I\'ve always said that BitPay should use the LibertyX location map as a guide for where to focus their efforts to gain new customers. Every strip mall with a LibertyX location should have at least one shop or restaurant that accepts Bitcoin via BitPay. If they did, you\'d see growth of adoption by brick and mortar businesses in urban centers long before the suburbs kick in. \n\n\nBeing tax season, though, it would probably be best to touch on the quagmire that is the current state of IRS guidance. Do you really think that the unbanked are going to track the purchase and sale (spend) dates as well as the cost basis of all BTC they could start using in their daily lives? If you don\'t use Coinbase or another service that dumps a transaction history, it can be quite an exercise that I think few would follow. That could put large segments of the population at risk of being non-compliant. I beg the makers of Mycelium to incorporate a transaction dump feature into the app, either by CSV export or Wi-Fi or cloud printing. That would be a huge leap forward. \n\nI, like many, saw immediately that the IRS regulations effectively killed Bitcoin as a day to day currency in the US. I think that is the elephant in the room. That the sudden widespread use of Bitcoin in the US could lead to its demise. Imagine the reaction of an urban poor person realizing that they were supposed to record and report the details of every transaction that resulted in a capital gain of more than 50c? \n\nNow imagine them, like me, using LibertyX and Mycelium. If they\'re not extremely careful with their tracking, they would never be able to go back and figure out exactly when they bought BTC, each time they spent it, which BTC they spent (yes, that matters) and how much they made or lost in each transaction. It\'ll just take one horrific tax year to decimate a segment of the population and send everyone else running for the hills. \n\nEdit: Seeing "in university" tells me you\'re not in the US. The UK has a similar way to buy BTC in, I believe, over 25,000 retailers across the kingdom. One key difference is that in the US, LibertyX offers among the best price (Bitstamp + 0% on the first $1,000, 1% after) while in the UK, this approach nets you some of the worst pricing available. Just about any other method of buying BTC offers a better price. ': 2, "Thanks for all of the info. I do live in the US and the paper will focus on US/populations (Idk why I put university instead of college).  \nMuch of the urban poor populations are currently working/earning money of the books to survive.  The vast majority already don't report their earnings to the govt. \nBitcoin could have a larger effect than you realize due to this fact. \nBloodsucking gangs/extortionists could possibly have a more difficult time taking their cut of earnings of BTC because it can be hidden more effectively than cash.\nI may use some of your insight in my essay.

When you buy BTC from LibertyX, you\'re not buying BTC directly. The process is equivalent to paying a bill at a check cashing place. You ask the teller to go into QPay, locate LibertyX, and indicate how much you want to pay. Each payment can be for $50, $100, or $300. They take your money and print out a receipt. Written on that receipt is a PIN code. Visit LibertyX.com/store, log into your account and indicate that you want to redeem a PIN. Go to your Bitcoin wallet and copy your deposit address to the clipboard. Return to the browser, type in the PIN code found on the receipt and paste in the deposit address. Click redeem and the transfer begins almost immediately. You can cite libertyx.com for all those details.\n\nYou may wish to research how the unbanked pay their bills and use prepaid cellular via these little specialty shops. Buying LibertyX PIN codes for BTC uses the same exact mechanism in many of the same stores. There are numerous networks that vendors join to allow walk-in payments. QPay is just one of them.\n\nI understand your point about the unbanked staying outside of the traditional financial system by primarily using cash and getting paid under the table. I would think not reporting capital gains earned on a property investment (which is exactly what gains earned on BTC are) is a more serious offense than not reporting traditional income. When you don\'t report income and get ill, you cannot claim the unreported income when calculating your disability payments. When you don\'t report investment income, that\'s a different story.\n\nIf you receive cash and stick it under your mattress, it is not earning interest. It is also likely not gaining in value due to inflation. If you receive BTC and hold onto it, it may triple in value before you get around to spending it. On the other hand it may sink precipitously in value during the interim, and that\'s a whole other part of the essay.\n\nFinally, to deepen your understanding of how BTC is an investment and not cash (if you need to do so!) search Google for "fincen bitcoin", "irs bitcoin" and "crs reports bitcoin" (no quotes for any of the searches, of course). They will turn up short, easy to digest documents describing how the government views Bitcoin and how they want you to treat gains earned by buying and selling or spending BTC.': 2}, ('The Alex Galaxy - A Day in the Life of a Bitcoin Prophet.

Right now there is no benefit for consumers: they actually lose 2% in opportunity cost when they fail to use their credit cards.

We need to work on getting merchants to see the utility of this digital currency, not demand they accept our magic internet money and when they do adopt it, immediately demand that they give us discounts for using it.  \n\nFurthermore, if the merchant is like me and decides to actually integrate the true decentralized trustless nature of Bitcoin and accept it natively in their site, there is not a payment processing fee, but I still have to deal with network fees (for my average order size, it\'s 0.06%) and conversion to fiat to pay my bills (~1%).

For me, and granted I work at Bitreserve, I feel Bitreserve can be trusted because it operates a full reserve that backs its obligations to its customers using real assets. We do not hedge, or use futures. When you store your value in gold for example, we purchase gold in a secured vaulted location. Same with silver, platinum and palladium. Oh, same for dollars and other fiat obligations too. That way, no matter what happens to the markets, our members\' value is safe.\n\nThis relates to insurance in that FDIC insurance, which many people think of when they talk about "insured accounts" exists because banks operate fractional reserves. In other words, because a bank may hold $1000 in obligations to me, there is no guarantee that they actually possess $1000 to give me at any one time. This is why a "bank run" is so scary - because a bank could literally run out of money to give it\'s customers (a scene from It\'s a Wonderful Like comes to mind actually). We do not have this problem, because we operate a FULL reserve. If one day everyone suddenly woke up and said, "I want out of Bitreserve" then all we would need to say is "be patient, everyone will get 100% of the money owed to them." \n\nTo offer greater assurances around this, we are the only company in the industry that publishes a real time ledger that shows the changes we make to our assets to secure the funds of our members. This allows us to prove at any given time that we have the assets on hand to back the obligations we have to our customers. (Is this the kind of insurance you mean?)\n\nAnd finally\xe2\x80\xa6 KYC and AML checks. I can certainly understand why some have become cautious about sharing personal information online, but at Bitreserve we do not see KYC and AML (Anti-Money Laundering) as a bad thing.

This means your opportunities to scalp are quite different, the market needs to move more to break-even. With 0 fee, you can move in an out with no extra spread created by fees.
