The latest move by the Chinese central bank to cap the amount of money that Chinese consumers can send through online sites has left commentators sharply divided.\n\nIn any case, the new guidelines released by the People\'s Bank of China on Friday are a big setback for the two big firms that dominate China\'s online payment system: Alipay, an offshoot of the ecommerce giant Alibaba, which controls almost 50 per cent of all Chinese online payments; and TenPay, the payment arm of the social media and gaming group Tencent, which controls about 20 per cent of the market.\n\nThese two big online payment groups are threatening to invade the traditional domain of China\'s big banks. Not only do they allow the payment of online purchases, but users can also use them to pay bills or settle the cost of a taxi ride. What\'s more, they can be used to make funds transfers within seconds, as well as offering financial investments.\n\nOnline payments are expected to hit \xc2\xa511.8 trillion yuan ($2.6 trillion) this year, up from \xc2\xa58.1 trillion last year, says Chinese internet market research firm iResearch.\n\nThe Chinese central bank\'s proposal, which will be adopted after a consultation period with industry, says Chinese citizens will be limited to making payments of \xc2\xa51000 a day on payment sites that require only one source of identification, and up to \xc2\xa55000 a day on sites that require at least two proofs of identity. Larger payments must be done through the payer\'s account at a commercial bank.\n\nFaced with opposition to its latest proposal to cap payments, the Chinese central bank took the highly unusual step of issuing a follow-up statement on the weekend that responded to the criticism.\n\nThe PBOC quoted figures showing that last year, 71 per cent of online payment platform users made payments totalling less than \xc2\xa51000, to support its claim that most users will be unaffected by the new cap.\n\nThe central bank also emphasised that its new rules were aimed at improving the security of internet payments.\n\n\'A HOLISTIC CONSIDERATION OF PAYMENT EFFICIENCY\'\n\n"Transfer limits are proposed based on a holistic consideration of payment efficiency and convenience, as well as factors such as anti-money laundering and client fund security," the bank said.\n\nBut although some believe that the PBOC\'s latest move is an attempt to introduce some order into the unregulated and chaotic world of internet finance, others see it as an effort to protect China\'s big state-owned banks.\n\nThey say Alibaba and Tencent are not only engaged in a fierce competition with each other, they\'re also facing resistance from the big Chinese banks, which for the most part have failed to come up with the innovative, easy-to-use interfaces offered by China\'s two internet champions.\n\nEven worse for the Chinese banks, these internet players are threatening to move further into their core activities.\n\nAlibaba has already launched an online money market fund, Yu\'E Bao, which offers attractive returns to Chinese savers. And after receiving a banking licence in June, Alibaba\'s finance affiliate launched a new online lender, MYBank, which will make loans of up to \xc2\xa55 million to private individuals and small firms. This follows Tencent\'s creation of WeBank, which began offering a commercial banking service in April. Both new operations are looking to take a slice of the estimated \xc2\xa523 trillion household loans market that is growing fast as more Chinese borrowers look for credit.\n\nThis move shouldn\'t worry Chinese bankers in the short term \xe2\x80\x93 Chinese banks filled the four top spots for profits across the global industry last year, earning almost double the amount of their US rivals. But they are worried that they could be missing out on a shift that is about to transform their business.\n\nFortunately for them as they battle to stave off growing competition from the country\'s internet giants, they have the ear of China\'s banking regulator, which is concerned about the growing risks in China\'s financial system.\n\n\n\nRead more: http://www.afr.com/markets/how-chinas-new-online-payment-limit-will-hit-alibabas-alipay-tencents-tenpay-20150805-gislhf#ixzz3i1U2wBhv \nFollow us: @FinancialReview on Twitter | financialreview on Facebook': 7, ">Uh that's ridiculous\n\nLot of things are.\n\nWell of course theoretically you can contact the merchant and ask if he takes bitcoin and then pay in btc, but practically that does not happen (often).

The key to getting any return at all (I'm talking on the order of pennies per day or less) would be essentially free electricity and minimizing any hardware costs. I'm pretty sure with the best current GPUs you can find some shares (which are the minimum units that show some work was done) at mining pools, but I have no idea how long it would take you to reach a minimum withdrawal amount (assuming its doable at all).  \n\n> I don't see how that wouldn't benefit me, and that's pretty much where I'm coming from. You think I should look into a used ASIC?  \n\nUnless you've got some pretty powerful GPUs laying around, you might need to start with a cheap ASIC to see anything actually happen at all (i.e. finding a significant number of shares). But remember, even with free electricity, you might never recoup the cost of even a $3 USB ASIC in your lifetime since difficulty just seems to keep increasing.  \n\nAnyone serious about trying to make a profit mining these days would need to start with one or more serious ASICs, like this:  \n\nhttp://www.ebay.com/itm/Bitmain-Antminer-S5-Asic-Bitcoin-Miner-SHA256-1155-GH-/271949088938?hash=item3f516dc8aa\n\nalong with the needed power supplies, a place with enough cooling and that's tolerant of the resulting fan noise, and of course, free or nearly free electricity for the 3-9 months that it'll take to break even (**if** that's even possible). And there are uncertainties like possible big increases in hashing technology that could happen between now and break even that could derail the chance to make a profit entirely. Another approach would be just mine as long as you think you're profitable, and then try to sell your equipment to recoup costs when you think you're falling behind the curve. A bankroll of $1,000 to $2,000 is probably minimum to start such an effort, plus you should really know what you're doing, and that it still would be a gamble.  \n\nNo matter how you approach it, it's a really tough proposition now. That's why I emphasize the hobby aspect. If you just want to learn the process and don't mind spending say $20 to $50 a month, you can learn all the ins and outs. If you get comfortable with the process, you could then re-evaluate if you want to make a big investment and try to make a profit (an effort that would be risky and is guaranteed to take a lot of time).  \n\nSome two or more years ago, the chance to make a profit mining was much higher. These days, if you think the value of bitcoin will appreciate you should really consider just buying some, or exchanging goods or services for some.

Intel is basically a chip manufacturer. Everything else they do is in support of maintaining and extending their dominance of the general purpose processor market. When Intel sees someone making silicon for a specific purpose that might help them sell their general purpose processors, they get interested and either build that capability themselves, invest in the company, or buy the company. "Intel Ventures" is basically a way of supporting ecosystem partners that help Intel sell more processors. This is why they\'ve invested so heavily into Cloud computing companies - the "cloud" is basically a big distribution channel for processors.\n\nSo the question is: how does blockchain technology help Intel sell general purpose processors? If they add mining computation hardware to their chips, then Intel can essentially make everyone a part of the Bitcoin world. Add a bit of special purpose hardware to help make the mining less susceptible to botnet takeover, such as enabling customers to register their hardware with the Intel mining pool, and locking the mining contributions with hardware encryption tied to the chip. Boom - Bitcoin mining moves to the masses, with each participant being paid a tiny sum for contributing a bit of power to the process.\n\nIf Intel believes that blockchain technology is going mainstream, making sure they are at the center of the blockchain world via mining hardware on every chip would ensure that AMD and ARM are less well suited to solve the problems that people want to solve using their general purpose processors.': 2, "I think there's a good chance that Intel is looking at adding some Bitcoin mining capabilities to some of their mass market processors.

Performance depends on the pool\'s/miner\'s node, not the ASIC.\n\nNot sure what you are getting at here... the performance of bitcoin is not a measure of "how fast blocks come". The performance of miners could undoubtedly be increased by (one of) the best chip manufacturer(s) in the world producing ASICs, or indeed other chip types which can perform bitcoin-related operations more efficiently at a hardware level.\n\nThe performance of the protocol is increased as an effect of the ability of nefarious parties being less able to compromise the network - the ability for governments and other entities to interfere or block transactions between people is further reduced. Remember, this protocol was not set up to provide \'the fastest payment network in the world\', the "performance" of the network to many people is a metric of its ability to resist government intervention, capital controls, inflation, financial institution intervention etc. (take your pick).\n\nAnother way of saying this is that the protocol would become more robust.\n\n>Robustness... Well mining is a business based on scale. No matter who builds the chips, a days centre will have less overhead than your toaster in the kitchen will need to be able to mine.\n \nThere were times in bitcoin\'s history where people speculated that if a single chip fab produced a single relatively good ASIC (and kept it for themselves) they would easily have over 50% of the hash rate. Thankfully with the introduction of the range of ASICs that we have now and the consequent increase in hash rate, bitcoin is more robust than ever (at least from a hashing perspective, it is debatable that pools have decreased its overall robustness/decentralisation).\n\n>Scalability too, miners don\'t care out even know if they build a 1mb or 1 gb block, all they get is a root hash to build upon.\n\n To be fair, I agree with this point that the scalability of bitcoin will not be directly improved necessarily by Intel manufacturing specific chips.

This is because; users simply have to pay whatever it takes to get their transaction in the next block OR users have to pay what they are able to pay to get their transaction in any block OR users can't pay and therefore don't send a transaction. Miners will therefore have an incentive to increase fees up to the point where users stop increasing their fee due to the reasons above.\n\nI don't see any particular problem with this since it is paying for the utility rather than paying for the cost.

This is because; users simply have to pay whatever it takes to get their transaction in the next block OR users have to pay what they are able to pay to get their transaction in any block OR users can\'t pay and therefore don\'t send a transaction. Miners will therefore have an incentive to increase fees up to the point where users stop increasing their fee due to the reasons above.\n\nThis is very good point.  It\'s possible to imagine a range of miners who accept different min fees, and thus it\'s a statistical game: pay a tiny fee and you\'ve got to wait until that supercheap miner gets a block.  But this seems to break down in the face of game theory, which says the supercheap miner will make most money, so everyone will want to do that...\n\nOtherwise you end up with some kind of collusion, either enforced by a protocol soft-fork or just by a cartel deprecating non-conformant blocks.  It\'s even possible for miners to roughly enforce a sliding scale of fees; if a transactions has too low fees it sits unmined in the mempool for a while.  That\'s not enforceable by protocol though, AFAICT.\n\n> I don\'t see any particular problem with this since it is paying for the utility rather than paying for the cost. The problem I see is if we start limiting the block size artificially on purpose to drive up fees.\n\nI hope the desire to expand the network is pretty ubiquitous: the debate is over which dangers are worse.  I hope that leads to a more constructive debate over what to *do* about it...\n\n> On a side note, do you think that if we could somehow get rid of pools that the problem of mining centralisation pressures with increased block size would go away?\n\nGood question!  One problem with mining pools is it\'s easy to say "flip this switch to reduce orphan rate!" goes away.  But maybe without mining pools, small miners would have vanished even sooner.\n\nI think the real answer is to do things to improve mining for everyone, and level the playing field.

Most people will still end up using banks, with all the normal problems.\n\nI emphatically agree. For example, the market price of BTC is roughly $300 USD today. During the spam attack, to be certain your transaction confirmed within the next block, you had to pay a fee of 0.0005 BTC.\n\n    0.0005 BTC * $300 = $0.15\n\nNow, imagine the market price for 1 BTC was $3000 or $30,000?\n\n    0.0005 BTC * $3000 = $1.50\n    0.0005 BTC * $30000 = $15.00\n\nNow suddenly it's $1.50 or $15.00 to send ANY transaction on the Bitcoin network. This is a major stumbling block for the majority of people on this planet. With a $15.00 fee, if you aren't sending $1000 straight to its final destination, in ONE go, you're getting reamed on fees. It's genuinely a painful experience to do something like that.\n\nNow imagine you want to do CoinJoin or multisig escrow payments with OpenBazaar. Those transactions have MULTIPLE HOPS. Multiply the base fee times two at a minimum, and now you're in for major pain.\n\nSo essentially, if Lightning Network or sidechains can't absolutely 100% replicate the functionality of multisig escrow, mixing and so forth, **and I'm convinced they cannot**, then the ONLY solution is to keep fees to a minimum. If this eats into the decentralization of full nodes, so be it. The fact is, the entire Bitcoin network always has been designed around cold storage, pure blockchain based payments. The MOMENT you suggest moving beyond that paradigm, the burden of proof is on YOU. I want to see OpenBazaar ricardian multisig escrow payments on Lightning. Where are they? Is it possible?

Bitcoin is pretty much perfectly designed for a cartel. 51% of the incumbents can set a bunch of rules and freeze out anyone who doesn\'t abide by them. They have strong economic incentives to do this, but they will also have no problem coming up with a justification about how this will be better for bitcoin. It will also allow them to use much more efficient pricing strategies than a dumb block size production quota, which turns away a lot of business while leaving a lot of the consumer surplus with the consumer.\n\nI think this will get me down-voted but a not-entirely-sarcastic thought experiment: Maybe we should apply the logic that\'s used to justify full-replace-by-fee and say that since it\'s in miners\' economic interests to do this, we should assume they\'re going to do it and embrace a bitcoin controlled by a cartel.

I say temporarily because as I\'m quoted above, with zero knowledge proofs, you can build a parasite contract for pretty much anything (otoh, you wouldn\'t really even need reporting consensus with cheap zk proofs, because you could prove on chain you made a certain api call to a reputable source and got result x, which could then be used to resolve an outcome).': 4, "You know what I find tiring?

Even with big enough stake the outcome of an attack is unpredictable for an attacker and could be done only in short-range (so with raising number of confirmations to 30 in our experiments attacks are always failed).

What would happen to the price? What would the cost be? Maybe if you are patient, over time you can accumulate a large amount of anything, but any meaningful inflow of capital into a market will necessarily increase the price. will it be 2x or 20x or 200x by the time 51% is obtained? Of course, depends on the coin, but the fact that there is a feedback loop to the cost for any financial attacker provides some level of protection.\n\n> On the other end mining power costs are not coupled to the price of a PoW coin, so if N@S requires an insane millionaire to conduct it, then this madman can far easily buyout the top mining pools or simply buy arbitrary amounts of mining hardware with the limit only being the manufacturing capacity of the vendors. Certainly a mass buy will raise the cost of the mining hardware due to the increased demand, but surely not more than 2x and only until the manufacturers start making new production runs. \n\n> To use a wild card against one approach but not the other is not quite an objective analysis.\n\n> At the high level, it seems that both PoW and properly implemented PoS are able to require capital investment to obtain the coins.

That doesn't mean we should support it.": 2, '> If it\'s entirely privately run, how is it immutable again\n\nThis is what nobody seems to understand about Bitcoin 2.0 stocks. It\'s ALL mutable, even the stocks you hold in private Bitcoin wallets on the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nBy all means, store all the stocks you want to inside a Bitcoin wallet. Imagine suddenly your wife divorces you, and you lose 50% of your assets in the divorce proceedings.\n\n**But you refuse to give up the stock ownership.**\n\nSince a company backs the stock that is being held in your Bitcoin wallet, the court can correspond with that company, **overriding your actions**, making the entire gimmick of putting shares inside your Bitcoin wallet pointless and even harmful as your actions still result in your assets being seized with the additional charge against you of being in contempt of court.\n\nHow exactly is that much better than a centralized database?\n\nNow, don\'t get me wrong. This isn\'t to say Bitcoin 2.0 is completely worthless. After all, that would be like saying decentralized prediction markets aren\'t valuable, or that derivatives aren\'t valuable. You can\'t stop people from betting on the price action of a stock, which can be the next best thing next to outright ownership.\n\n**But ownership is ownership.** The reason Bitcoin is special is you either have it, or you don\'t. It doesn\'t matter what a court or government says you own.\n\nFor this reason, Bitcoin 2.0 stocks will ALWAYS be a sideshow, from now and forever into the future. When publicly traded companies issue shares on the blockchain, nothing changes about the legal system that says if you own the share in a Bitcoin wallet, it\'s yours. Nope, it\'s what the court says and it\'s ultimately what the company says. They can decide not to pay you, decide to arbitrarily reassign your shares without your consent, etc. No 51% attacks necessary.\n\nYes, there are workarounds. Instead of having ownership over the stock, you bet on where the stock\'s price is headed in the future. THAT asset cannot be seized. But it\'s not a stock. It isn\'t the same thing.\n\nThe bottom line is the blockchain is ONLY good for safeguarding bearer instruments that legal authorities or entities have zero ability to alter, change or reassign. This puts blockchains if anything at complete odds with stock trading. Because when a court compels a corporation to take an action, like reassign ownership of shares, they don\'t have a choice in the matter.\n\nTLDR; Bitcoin 2.0 stocks are a gimmick. Get used to monkeys making screeching sounds as they champion their various "Blockchain" stock trading platforms that they\'ve dumped millions of dollars into.\n\nAt all levels, they are just pretending like the blockchain is helping you secure your assets whereas your entire fiction of ownership will shatter into a million pieces the second a court of law becomes involved. It\'s extremely overvalued, and it irks me that so many people are now assuming "without *Wall Street* stock trading" Bitcoin is doomed.
