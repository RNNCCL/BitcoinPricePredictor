Occasionally, BTC would work great for something I need, but I don't want to have to go through the massive hassle of learning how and then actually dealing with bitcoin in order to pay them. There are an uncountable number of easy ways something could go wrong and I rather not have to hear 'you're a dumbass and it's your fault' or 'sorry for your loss'.\n\nSo, again, such a market exist. Problem is that I'm not sure how sustainable it really is. Again, using myself as an example, the occasions where I would want to pay in BTC is rare...super rare. I'm talking it only pops up one or twice a year kind of rare. Which is probably to be expected. If I was the kind of person who needs to utilize BTC repeatedly rather than rarely, I'd probably go through the massive hassle of dealing with it...but I don't need it that often.\n\nIf the other potential consumers are the same as me...chances are whatever potential middleman that pops up is likely to get a very low amount of sales.

I could pay for a product anytime I wanted.\n\nSigning up for Coinbase/Circle involves creating an account, connecting a bank account, verifying your account, then actually having to buy bitcoin for usage with all the details that involves (of which the security aspect alone is extremely daunting). Only after all of that will I be able to start paying for products...which itself is actually another learning process.

During the last - I'd say - 1.5 years this stuff is getting more and more visible to me (location: EU); e.g. I see nearly all of the banks closing most of their personell-driven direct-to-customer stuff and put terminals for registered bank accounts there, going the 'online'-route (chat/video-support, online banking with computerized assistants), and so on.\n\nAnd at the same time restrictions of e.g. exchanging or sending money without being a registered consumer has gotten much more expensive or even made impossible over here. And they don't even tell it to you if you don't ask... Recently I wanted to do a wire transfer (domestic) via cash, unregistered at a normal sized / popular bank here - which was no problem like a few months back (it did cost a fee, but well - it was possible at least) - and the cashier told me; sorry - you can't, we don't do it anymore since quite some time.

I never read or heard about them doing so in public, so I think it was more likely a 'silent' move to not make a big fuss about it. I had to go to another bank where it still is possible (they told me they are one of the few left in that area accepting unregistered wire-transfers [unregistered not in the sense of anonymous but in the sense of not having a bank account or being a regular/registered customer there], but they charge like 5\xe2\x82\xac to do so - which is A LOT for just not giving them all of your data)...": 1, 'I see it as an inevitability.

So, the long term pressure will be to remove cash, and replace it with something universally traceable and under their control.\n\nNow, the only alternative to a system controlled by them, is a system controlled by us. The only way they can get to a cashless society using a system under their control is if they can figure out how to make such a system as desirable or more desirable to the public than cash. \n\nThe race is between "bitcoin" like systems and Centralized systems from google, apple, etc... that are effectively government systems in that the government can with a push of a button see all your transactions, lock your account, etc.... \n\nWhile bitcoin may be only psuedo anon, that isn\'t really the most important part, IMO, the most important part is lack of ability to lock an account. Any system endorsed by the government will have that ability, and that ability is effectively the power to prevent anyone at will from transacting, and that that is the ultimate power.\n\nSo, it\'s our system or their system.

Please read more details in SideChains white paper, page 6 [1].\n\n> it is inappropriate to say "we can assume (...)  2-way pegs"\n\nWhy is it inappropriate to say that? A possibility for 2-way pegs is going to happen in one form or another. And if Bitcoin fails to deliver, it will be in the next cryptocurrency taking its place.

Lets take the UK pound against dollar. Both these currencies follow the same type of financial regulation, where the central authorities keep releasing more and more into the market. This keeps them both in equivalent rates. However, bitcoin is not like any of them. So in the long term its price is going to keep on increasing, all other things being equal. \n\nThat means a lot of periods of turbulent prices.

Right now 1 bitcoin is divisible to 100 million satoshis (8 decimal places). A protocol change to refine precision into more decimal places is technically easily possible.

Either Bitcoin adds precision on protocol level or if there was no consensus on adding more decimal places and making satoshis divisible (for whatever reason), this would incentivise another cryptocurrency to serve as a silver to Bitcoin\'s gold. At that point in future we can assume protocol changes will allow seamless cross-chain transfers using 2-way pegs. For example imagine a side-chain which has exactly the same implementation as the Bitcoin\'s blockchain, but pegs 1 satoshi on the Bitcoin blockchain to 1 "side-BTC" on the side-chain. By implementing this trivial scheme you would easily achieve Bitcoin\'s satoshis to be additionally divisible to another 8 decimal places, without a need for permission from anyone.

The number of months is equal to the number of participants. Let\'s take an example of 12 people, each contributing 1000 Bahts (can be much more than that) per month for 12 months. That\'s 12000 Bahts available the first month.\n\n> Each month, the participants bid to indicate how badly they need the cash. The highest bidder takes the money, then until the end of the "share" he cannot bid anymore, but must contributes the 1000 Bahts, plus the amount of his bid every month. For example someone who won the cash on the first month with a bid of 100 Bahts gets 12000 Bahts immediately, but has to pay 1100 Bahts every month for the 11 remaining months. So the second month, the amount available is 12100 Bahts, and increases every month as each winning bidder starts to pay the nominal 1000 Bahts plus the amount of his own bid. At the end of the "share", only one person without winning bid remains (normally someone who doesn\'t need cash but wants to "invest"), and collects the cash, something like 13000+ Bahts depending on the bids of all the other participants in the preceding months.\n\n>In total, the winning bidder of the first month gets 12000 Bahts early, but pays 1000 + 11x1100 = 13100 Bahts, equivalent to (1100/12000)x100 = 9.2% interest. On the other hand the person without winning bid on month 12 has invested 1000x12 = 12000 Bahts, but receives 13000+ Bahts, equivalent to a (1000/12000)x100 = 8.3+% profit.

Bitcoin needs to start updating and adapting to it's increasing demand.": 19, 'Bitcoin isn\'t going to compete with slick Proof of Stake coins like Ethereum or Bitshares -- which are leaps and bounds ahead of Bitcoin in so many different ways -- by becoming more like them. Scaling Bitcoin, which seems like a colossal task to move through, is just a drop in the ocean of things Bitcoin would need to do to compete on those coins\' on their own terms. Crazy projects like the one Dotcom is talking about are naturally going to work better with a fully programmable and super fast coin like Ethereum.\n\nBitcoin needs to focus instead on reinforcing her own advantages. For instance, Bitcoin, being a proof-of-work coin, is inherently more trustworthy as a global currency. The fact that it is not *permanently* controlled by anyone, nor could it be, is immensely important when we are talking about a global bank that will have citizens all over the planet interacting with it. Proof of Stake coins operate more like private companies than impersonal, fair, and just decentralized systems. Even the democratized version of PoS implemented by Bitshares is really just the same model used by publicly traded companies today. Putting the world\'s monetary system into the hands of a private corporation just isn\'t a very attractive sounding idea. A monetary system that transcends government money must be considered neutral and fair by all parties for it to ever be accepted as such. Neutral and fair is precisely what Bitcoin has going for it, and unfortunately these other proof-of-stake coins, for all their advantages, will never have that. \n\nThe primary focus with Bitcoin should be on strengthening her decentralized, fungible, and anonymous nature, things that reinforce the idea of a neutral, trustworthy system. A system that isn\'t going to steal your money and doesn\'t judge what you use your money for. This is the kind of thing that will give Bitcoin a permanent advantage over her more centralized competitors as a monetary system. If protocol level changes are easily implemented in a coin, like Ethereum for example, then it is also easy to implement in that coin KYC or other changes that violate trust in it. The fact that it is difficult to get protocol level changes through with Bitcoin increases the perception that the coin is trustworthy and that only changes that are broadly accepted, rather than just dictated from on high, will ever be implemented. \n\nThis is precisely why innovation within the Bitcoin ecosystem must happen outside of the protocol layer itself, though ideally protocol level changes will be implemented that help facilitate, rather than hamper, such innovation. There is nothing wrong with having private companies doing the innovating and profit-seeking on additional layers as long as the protocol layer itself is not privatized, as it essential is in proof-of-stake coins. If private entities, like Blockstream, can innovate to give Bitcoin various advantages that harness the advantage of having such a dependable, trustworthy, and secure core, then more power to them! These companies could very well be the key to Bitcoin\'s future success and why ultimately trying to turn the core into Ethereum-lite will just prove to be unnecessary. More importantly, perhaps, is that the advantages to having such a strong settlement layer, monetarily, will prove to be what allows for greater innovation, using additional layers, than what the "faster, slicker" coins will be capable of.  \n': 5, "Another article full of hype and empty of actual information.  \nIt says they are going away from IPv4, why?

That there will be a massive growth in the industry which creates services on "the layer above".  \n\nIf that doesn\'t pan out, Bitcoin itself goes nowhere.  Things were looking up with all the VC funding over the last year.  But none of them were services which created side chains or increased transaction volumes.  To date there are still no freaking side chain projects (!!) even though we are completely relying on them to keep Bitcoin more than a mere novelty. \n\nNow, VC funding has slowed and is getting poured into alternative systems that will be capable of supporting high transaction volumes.  And proprietary block chains.  KimDC was saying Bitcoin, now he\'s saying block chain. NASDAQ was saying Bitcoin.  Now they\'re gone.  Fidelity etc. \n\nSo now what?  Hope for a new wave of VC funding to extend bitcoins capabilities to Visa/MasterCard volumes?  Sit back and pray someone sees this need and meets it?

Blockstream is one of these - essentially, many core devs want to keep BTC as backbone rails for settlement, which would force consumers to use another layer to transact, like Blockstream. If bitcoin is fixed, then their startups go up in smoke. Initially, the blocksize limit didn\'t exist, then it was created as a temporary stop gap to prevent spam with the intention of removing it later, and now it\'s a permanent "feature not a bug." Gavin was hosed and exiled for pointing this out.\n\nWe\'ve hit the blocksize limit before, and a transaction system must be optimized to serve maximum volume - not mean or median volume. Think of Amazons servers - they have untold server space, basically just for Christmas shopping volumes. Visa and Amex are capable of handling maximum transaction volumes. So the claim that the "average block size" isn\'t big enough yet is just a non sequitur. It\'s already too late when average blocks are large, and they may never even fill up - there is an opportunity cost of making a choice, which is any other choice. Blocks may well never fill up because people are too hesitant to place any more load on the network and seek out a better solution. \n\nHere\'s the part about Kim dot com. Poduct developers are accounting for the world in future years, not where we currently are. They\'re not going to hamstring themselves to an artificially generated blocksize limit - if what they need doesn\'t exist, they\'ll make it. This is the future hypothetical conclusion of current events where bitcoin becomes irrelevant because a handful of people wanted to make a few measly million dollars. \n\nAnyway, much consternation has struck up about this debate.
