The facts are that:\n\n1. These random passphrases are not at all more memorable than random gook, as the study linked in my article above shows.\n2. From my personal knowledge and experience, I am convinced that **loss is a much much more frequent problem than theft**.\n\nMy own money is stored in brainwallets whose passwords roughly follow the advice above; they're a combination of a username and some formatted words, phrases and song lyrics. Yes, obviously the passwords have suboptimal entropy; but that's why they're much longer than 80 bits! And no, I definitely don't just use a single source of data; using multiple heterogeneous sources is obviously absolutely necessary.\n\nThat said, after writing that article I realized that there is another, even more interesting, scheme that allows you to protect against loss even more: combine erasure coding with storing bits on the blockchain. That is, let's say you have a brainwallet containing personally chosen chunks k1, k2, k3, k4, k5 (say, with 27 bits per chunk). Use an erasure code to expand that to k1, k2, k3, k4, k5, k6, k7, where k6 and k7 will necessarily be pseudorandom. DO NOT MEMORIZE k6 and k7; instead, stick them on the blockchain in a way that you know that you will be able to find them again. Then, if you need to get your brainwallet back, you can combine **any three** of k1, k2, k3, k4, k5 with the k6 and k7 on the blockchain to recover the original seed. You still have 80 bits of security, but it's now stored in a 3-of-5 fashion that's more robust to you losing parts of it.\n\nThe reason why you need the blockchain, and can't just erasure code k1, k2, k3 to get k4 and k5 is that if you do that, k4 and k5 will be pseudorandom, which makes them harder to memorize; the whole point of good password schemes is that they have low entropy when stored in your mind, shaped by decades of personal memories and experience that you can use as a compression algorithm, but high entropy from the point of view of everyone else, and random data give you zero such advantage.": 5, 'So electrum seeds are a bad idea too?

A 4-word or 8-character password is fine for a password on a website (though it shouldn\'t be reused), but brain wallets are different. You have to throw away everything you\'ve been taught about password security because unlike any website or encryption password, everyone in the world will be *constantly* trying to brute-force your brain wallet passphrase *forever*. So your passphrase has to be amazingly strong. Typically what\'s recommended is 128 bits of entropy (12 **RANDOM** words with Electrum\'s wordlist, or 10 words with a Diceware wordlist), though you could probably get by with a little less.\n\nAlso, it is strongly recommended that you not actually rely 100% on your memory. You might have difficulty imagining this happening to you, but it\'s very common for people to just suddenly find that they\'ve forgotten a password. Unlike losing a bank password, forgetting a brain wallet passphrase that only exists in your mind will destroy your bitcoins.\n\nYou\'re also not supposed to manually deal with individual Bitcoin keys. It\'s error-prone and encourages address reuse (which is terrible for privacy and security). People frequently lose bitcoins when handling keys manually due to issues with change or fees. Even Bitcoin experts never handle keys manually when dealing with any significant amount of BTC.\n\nSo the proper way to do a "brain wallet" would be to use Electrum\'s mnemonic feature (and write down the mnemonic somewhere). Or if you really want to do everything yourself for some reason:\n\n* Choose a passphrase that contains around 128 bits of entropy by *randomly* choosing words from a list. The number of entropy bits is `log_2(<number of words in list>^<number of words chosen>)`. Use dice or a computer\'s cryptographically secure random number generator to choose the words. Humans cannot generate random numbers or words.\n* Write down your passphrase and put it in a safe deposit box or something.\n* Apply key stretching to the passphrase. I have some proof of concept code for this [here](https://github.com/theymos/passphrase/blob/master/passphrase.py), but it\'s not suitable for real-world use. Maybe someone else has better code with more review.\n* Give the final key to Electrum or another HD wallet as a custom seed for the HD wallet. Last I checked, you can do this in Electrum by giving it the hexadecimal key/seed when it asks for your mnemonic seed. Electrum will then be able to generate an infinite number of Bitcoin keys from your generated seed, and you won\'t have to deal with keys manually.': 44, "> I recommend a BIP38 paper wallet with a passphrase generated using diceware with at least eight words.\n\nIsn't that overkill?

A more fully-fleshed-out tool might allow the user to choose from among many other unforgettable or easy-to-remember questions, estimate the entropy gain of these questions/answers against both targeted and untargeted attacks, and combine+stretch this info in a uniform and somehow forward- and backward-compatible way to produce a final key/seed.": 2, "You can. \n\nYou can do this insecurely (like brainwallet.org does) or you can do it securely (for example memorizing an electrum seed).\n\nYou can store coins in cold storage securely or insecurely too.

I\'ve also come to the conclusion that some of this can probably be achieved in a less intuitive way by manually generating new addresses and somehow managing the use of that. I\'ve also realized that the main difference is really the use of "Payment Request" and the fact that amounts are split up into coins of different denominations, each different from the full amounts being transferred.
