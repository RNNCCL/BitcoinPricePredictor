There are 3 components here:\n\n* System *X*.\n* System *Y*.\n* A pegging mechanism.\n\nThe [Sidechains&nbsp;Whitepaper](https://blockstream.com/sidechains.pdf) mentions several methods by which a 2-way peg can be constructed, and concentrates on a particular one, due to its relative simplicity to model, scale, and deploy:\n\n* **the Symmetric SPV-proof 2-way Peg**\n\nThis method allows for arbitrarily strong security; if you want to improve *exponentially* the probability that a transfer is valid, just wait a little longer. This is similar to how normal SPV Bitcoin clients work, but the paper notes that further additional information can be included with the transfer in order to make that process even more robust, but that's just a detail.\n\nIn any case, it is not envisioned that 2-way pegs be used regularly or for small transfers, both because trusting the validity requires waiting a not-insignificant amount of time (perhaps a few days) and because the SPV-proofs are not-insignificant in size (though the whitepaper describes a pretty interesting way to make them quite compact).\n\nInstead, it is intended that large transfers be made, and then people on both sides of the peg can simply trade their coins nearly instantly using an already well-established, robust, trustless method that works *today* across blockchain systems that are not even pegged:\n\n* **the Atomic Swap** (which is also described in the paper).\n\nWhat makes the atomic swap even more useful for pegged blockchains than for non-pegged blockchains is that there is no volatility in price (because the tokens are pegged), which greatly simplifies the market for (*i.e.,* the organizing of) swaps.\n\nGreat.\n\nNow, how does a blockchain system check an SPV proof? Well, a new system created specifically to be a sidechain certainly can be programmed from the start to understand them, but what about Bitcoin, which was designed before the concept of an SPV proof was even developed? There are 2 approaches:\n\n* If (or when) Bitcoin's script language is finally made just slightly more powerful (perhaps even as powerful as it was when Satoshi first released it), then it will be possible to describe the validation process using just Bitcoin's script; that is to say, if the Bitcoin world ever wants even slightly smart contracts, then that implies the Bitcoin world wants to allow for the permissionless creation of symmetric SPV-proof 2-way pegs.\n\n    Such improvements to Bitcoin's script can be introduced with a soft fork.\n\n* Because 2-way pegs are awesome, and are clearly the future of the Internet of Money, it would be silly to require the overhead inherent in describing them with generic Bitcoin script primitives; instead, it makes a lot more sense to build that description directly into Bitcoin by creating a script primitive dedicated to SPV-proof validation.\n\n    Such augmentation to Bitcoin's script can be introduced with a soft fork.\n\nOf course, a soft fork is not quite permissionless to deploy; it requires significant approval from the Bitcoin world, and it's difficult to get that approval unless the correctness of a plan can be demonstrated. Yet, how can there be such a demonstration unless there are implemented sidechains with which real-world value can be experimented? Simple:\n\n* **the Federated Peg**\n\nThe insight here is that any missing functionality in Bitcoin's script processing can already be provided permissionlessly by a third party, *and* that this third party need not be particularly trusted. The paper thus describes what is called a federated peg, which not only can provide arbitrarily distributed trust, but also allows for users in the Bitcoin world to send and receive transactions from others without even realizing that the coins are making their way through a 2-way peg! (It merely appears that coins are being sent through a multisignature address.)\n\nThe federated peg is actually suited to private blockchains that are interesting to a consortium of mutually distrusting organizations (*e.g.,* banks). It's also an excellent way to bootstrap and maintain a minimum degree of security for a sidechain that is ultimately meant to transition to a symmetric SPV-proof 2-way peg in the long term.\n\nHence, using the federated peg will allow for a nascent Internet of Money to begin to develop, proving the worth of sidechains.\n\n**tl;dr:** A 2-way peg can be made arbitrarily secure, can be deployed permissionlessly already, and won't even be an issue for everyday use between \\[important\\] sidechains, anyway.": 4, 'Rootstock is a federated side chain, so it is owned and pegged to Bitcoin by a closed group.

Miners don't need to understand or intend to exploit this.\n\nMiners already frequently produce blocks [stuffed full of worthless transactions](https://www.blocktrail.com/BTC/block/000000000000000010bb8029bcecc926dc07b25ac8634ec4f8e83e70d9b7417c/5) that only increase the system's operating costs. Often the transaction selection is performed by third party pools who don't suffer most of the costs in any case.\n\nIf orphaning produces pressure on miners, the solution miners have used historically is to centralize around fewer larger pools, not to include fewer transactions. Improved relay (IBLT is not enough) can help reverse that pressure; and so I believe it would be a net benefit.\n\nFortunately, the system has a block size limit; which sets an upper limit on the damage and, hopefully, prevents the largest miners (which would benefit from the inequality) from driving other miners out.\n": 5, "I don't think it's fully known yet what level of optimization would be achieved. Also the entire scheme depends on miners working together, maybe some will feel like they have an advantage to keep their lower orphan risk and will not want to help other miners lower theirs?\n\nAnother thing that could complicate things is that this is an optimization for mempools being in sync, or close to it. Transactions still need to be published and relayed across the network, that bandwidth and latency is not changed, this optimization would just prevent them from having to be sent a second time. The second time is often more important because it can happen in a racing condition to publish blocks, but that's not 100% of the time\n\nMy feeling is that it would lower orphan risk and make the network more decentralized by potentially replacing the relay network, however leaving the relay network should slow things down so it could end up being a wash maybe? Also orphan risk as it compares to block size is even an unknown now because if you look at the historic orphan rate compared to the average block size, block sizes have gone up while orphan rates have stayed flat\n\nAnother thing to think about is that at some level miners might want to keep the network looking healthy in node count and they'd cap their blocks at something to make it not so expensive to host a node": 1}, ('Micro payments for content.', 1): {"Hello there.

Here are the 3 aspects of Bitcoin he wanted to change most(emphasis are mine):\n\n**1.Have transactions refer to previous outputs by a hash that omits the scriptSig.**\n\n**2.Use Schnorr signatures instead of ECDSA**\n\n   3.Go back in time and have the Bitcoin-Qt wallet use hierarchical deterministic keys.\n\nFrom: http://interviewly.com/i/gavin-andresen-oct-2014-reddit\n\n\nAnother crucial cryptographical improvement brought to you by Segwit: \n\n"Multisig payments currently use P2SH which is secured by the 160-bit HASH160 algorithm (RIPEMD of SHA256). However, if one of the signers wishes to steal all the funds, they can find a collision between a valid address as part of a multisig script and a script that simply pays them all the funds with only 80-bits (2^80) worth of work, which is already within the realm of possibility for an extremely well-resourced attacker. (For comparison, at a sustained 1 exahash/second, the Bitcoin mining network does 80-bits worth of work every two weeks)\n\nSegwit resolves this by using HASH160 only for payments direct to a single public key (where this sort of attack is useless), while using 256-bit SHA256 hashes for payments to a script hash."\n\nFrom: https://bitcoincore.org/en/2016/01/26/segwit-benefits/\n\nIf anything deserves a fork of Bitcoin at whatever cost, I think it would be cryptographic hardening against looming attacks.': 25, 'In the English language "bye" means I\'m leaving now, and generally signals the end of the conversation.

I think of it along 3 axes.  1. Development, 2. Validation (aka full node count), and 3. Mining.\n\n1.  Development is currently almost completely centralized with a dozen core devs controlling all code updates and threatening scorched earth tactics (like changing the PoW algorithm to put all miners out of business if they adopt classic).  A dozen core devs have managed to stave off the desires of the rest of the community for a while now.  Growth in bitcoin generally brings more engineering interest and more funding for development, supporting multiple developer teams.\n\n2. Validation is currently at 5500 full nodes.  The count has indeed been dropping, I think primarily as a function of ASICS.  In the earliest days, people would mine and run a full node.  Today, mining is pointless for individuals, so many of those same people have turned off their full nodes.  The individuals that mine mostly do so altruistically.  What is most likely to create more altruistic full node providers?  I think a larger pool of these individuals and more wealth in the bitcoin ecosystem (e.g. people like Roger Ver who got rich off of bitcoin are likely to "give something back" altruistically and run a full node).  Core devs have said that since running a node at 2 MB is more expensive than at 1 MB, that the full node count will fall in the event of an upgrade.  Probably true, but probably not substantially.  Everyone I know who runs a full node says that 2 MB would be trivially easy for them.  It\'s also worth noting that major economic players (e.g. companies that use bitcoin) almost always run a full node for validation.  So the larger the bitcoin economy gets, the more of these players that will operate full nodes.  This growth is relatively slow though.  100 new Coinbases might only provide 100 new full nodes.  \n\n3.  Mining has grown increasingly centralized as a result of ASICs and cheap electricity in China.  No one has suggested a solution to this.  We could change the PoW mechanism, but that\'s currently politically unpopular.  I don\'t know if more adoption would decentralize mining, but decreasing BTC prices would certainly do the opposite since it\'s the least efficient miners who would turn off first, leaving mostly huge server farms mining bitcoin.\n\n\n\n': 0, "Didn't satoshi predict mining centralization over time?
