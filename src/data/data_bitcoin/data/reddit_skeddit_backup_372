This is true given that blocks are valid. The blockchain is there to reach a consensus on the order of transactions.\n\nAgreed. I think the consensus is only true in the technical sense. In a sense, the idea of longest chain of work created a whole new *battleground* (attached to having this technical goal) in which competing parties will fight \'wars\' to win the majority.\n\nGladly, these wars are fought with hashpower and swaying users and not with nukes.\n\nAnd I think *this* is the big advantage of Bitcoin. This is also making it a lot more peaceful than actual war. I also think this might, in \'end game\' scenarios make countries fight \'wars\' or create MAD with hashpower - that would be an awesome outcome.\n\nBut the recent dispute shows that \'consensus\' is a very nice sounding thing for something that can be very much like a battle in the end. There\'s \'consensus\' on who\'s the ruler after a country has ben conquered, so to speak.\n\n> In fact I am planning to switch to XT, absent any other options.\n\nI think this is exactly what is going to happen for people who are sitting on the fence.

': 3, 'Yes, that is basically it, except thee can be many transactions in a block.\n\nOne miner wins per block that is accepted into the main chain.\n\nOne block is found statistically every 10 minutes ': 3, 'Transactions are put into blocks so that there\'s an established order, so that if there are two transactions trying to spend the same coins you know which one to reject because the other one came first. That achieves consensus about which transactions should be accepted within a chain without anyone having to be an authority figure or somehow communicate and compare notes outside of the chain. Or when there are multiple valid chains (i.e. when there\'s a fork in the chain creating two different/contradictory versions of history), *then* we settle consensus again by agreeing to always use the longest one.\n\nBut using that scheme, creating blocks has to be *difficult* so that you can\'t fuck around with the lengths of different forks - if you could just add blocks at will then you could spend some coins in exchange for goods/services, then invalidate the transaction by adding a bunch of blocks to a fork until it became the new longest (and hence "real") chain. But because adding a block is computationally difficult, everyone else combined will build up the \'main\' chain faster than you can build up your fork that would give you back your coins. At least so long as you don\'t have enough of a computer-farm to out-race everyone else put together.\n\nThe actual *task* of mining is useless busywork (the part that makes it difficult anyway - the useful bit is computationally lightweight), but it\'s useless busywork with exactly the right properties you want the useless busywork to have. It depends on the contents of the block so you have to start over from the beginning for each new block, and can\'t work it out ahead of time; the expected time it\'ll take can be scaled up and down easily by changing the \'difficulty\' value; it\'s easily verified once someone provides the answer... all good things.\n\nBut computer equipment and power and cooling are expensive, so to make it worth anyone\'s while to provide the useful service of securing the network (by providing enough computer power that 51% attacks aren\'t feasible), it needs to be incentivised, which is achieved with transaction fees and block rewards.': 5, 'Correct ---miner validation is a race and whoever validates a block first is rewarded with 25 BTC.The race involves massive hardware investment and massive computing power.': 5, "Miners add new blocks to the blockchain.\n\nThey do a lot of math to generate blocks.

X works out to be on average 10 minutes apart by the rules of the network.  Once you have a way to show a truly random person is selected they verify your transaction and every transaction ever done before it.  For doing this work they get to create and award themselves the reward (currently 25 bitcoins) that they can spend in 100 verifications later.  Typically people pool their computing power together much like a lottery syndicate does so they share everyone's winnings in the pool to get a more even/regular payment rather than nothing until they win the 25BTC jackpot themselves.  The payout is usually dependent on how much computing power they contributed to that mining pool.\n\n\nBefore you get suckered into it though, mining is a zero sum game, unless you've already started or have free electricity it's not a way to make money :)": 5, "I think it's important to note that running a full node verifies the transactions. A miner packages up the transactions into blocks. If the miner is also running a full node (solo mining) they are also verifying transactions.
