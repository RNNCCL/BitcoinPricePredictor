Web wallets are generally not considered to be "secure" because the site maintainer has final control over your funds (rather than you having final control over your funds). I do trust several web wallets with small amounts of coin, including coinbase and changetip, but at the end of the day I only trust storage where I hold the private keys - like a local desktop wallet. I use other services freely and trust many of them, I hold the private keys to my other funds. I encourage people to keep less than 1% of their annual earnings in online wallets, and learn about local and/or cold storage if they intend to keep more than that.\n\n> all with varying levels of security, privacy and rights/protection for the user?\n\nMost of the public services have developed a decent system for managing coins, but I recommend using a 2FA (2 factor authentication) wherever possible. Many thefts transcend 2FA by attacking the service itself, but it is always good practice.\n\n> you can send bits to any reddit users this way\n\nYou can send tips to any reddit, twitter, or google user and they will receive a notification on their respective account. Your email address is not required. This is the beauty of bitcoin. Simple and frictionless.\n\n> the government are pushing for a digital online ID\n\nThis has been foolish talk for years and there\'s no evidence that it is making any progress. It\'s contradictory to the foundational privacy laws of most countries and will likely not happen in our lifetimes anywhere without a revolutionary fight. As far as linking that identity to bitcoin accounts - any user can generate thousands of bitcoin accounts all day long and there\'s no mechanism to stop them.\n\n> won\'t that essentially mean we could end up with a "one world currency" legislated by the government? Isn\'t that what Bitcoin was actively trying to avoid (and quite rightly so)?\n\nI cannot predict the future.\n\n> Sorry for all the questions.\n\nIntelligent questions are always welcome. Please continue to ask anything on your mind.': 1, '> Which offline storage would you put in the top few to try first in terms of experience. \n\nIt has been awhile since I compared the wallets, but I think Armory and Electrum are regarded as the best and most secure. I feel comfortable recommending both of them.\n\n> It seems that coinbase require you full legal name and details Etc before you can use the account.\n\nThis is because of Know Your Customer (KYC) laws and supported by FinCen guidance in the US. Businesses that operate in the United States and exchange money are required to collect all of your personal information and perform a prostate exam before exchanging money with you. There aren\'t many easy ways to get around this I\'m afraid.\n\n>  I don\'t like that idea, particularly as I may not be a big user and therefore don\'t feel the they need all that info (particularly if I am just testing the service) if I test 5 services and have to give them all my name, address, email Etc that\'s a lot of data to give out for no real reason. I\'ll try circle next.\n\nI would limit your testing of services to those that are well regarded. Each service you give your information to is subject to data breach that could put your information in the wrong hands. It happens every day with big banks and big business, but there\'s no reason to to be more exposed then you need to be. \n\n\n> Will changetip allow you to pay for services in the future? If so that would be a very nice way to perform a transaction. That would be relatively seemless and as anonymous as a cash transaction for all intents and purpose. \n\nAgain, here\'s one of the frictionless beautiful features of bitcoin - you can already pay for any service through your changetip wallet. There\'s no special feature to be built. If you withdraw funds from changetip and enter them into a bitcoin payment field at newegg, you are paying for that service.\n\n> Do shops that accept Bitcoin allow you to buy Bitcoin?\n\nNot generally. This may be regarded as "exchanging money" and it requires government permission, a saliva sample, and two hairs from your firstborn. Blame government, not bitcoin. There ARE some hints that [blockchain.info](http://www.coindesk.com/gogocoin-partners-with-blockchain-give-away-btc-loaded-cards/) will make that possible, but we\'ve been waiting a LONG time with little public progress.\n\nAlso - I failed to mention http://blockchain.info - it\'s a very well regarded wallet service (and smartphone app) that is a cross between a web wallet and a desktop wallet. It generally offers high security and it does not control your private keys (you control your private keys through a complex password). A lot of folks rely on this wallet. If you check it out, please use a very secure password, back it up, 2FA, etc. etc. Thefts HAVE happened, but always because of poor end-user security.\n\nKeep them coming.

So I googled the error and it appears that this is related to browser settings. Now I\'m currently on an iOS device which doesn\'t really have that many settings to configure so I made a few changes to the security and cookie settings and that now worked. \n\nCSRF is related to a web attack called Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

Correct?\n\nHmm.. you\'re getting there. Your kids will want to have their own wallet, and we haven\'t really talked about what a wallet is yet because it\'s kind of an abstract concept. And while I _AM_ building trust in changetip, it\'s not wise to store your children\'s nest egg there. Don\'t build the nest egg yet, but when you do, you\'ll be interested in an offline cold storage wallet, like one provided at http://bitaddress.org. [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=872eSnlKUeg) video seems to provide a decent introduction, but I haven\'t really watched it. Again, don\'t do these things until you have a better grasp of the big picture.\n\n> However, how do you get your bits from a change tip account to a wallet?\n\nchangetip **IS** a wallet, you can send funds from there to anywhere. It is great for multipurpose sending, the only thing you need to keep in mind is that you\'re not the only one with access to the wallet, in fact, the owner of changetip holds the private keys that actually control the wallet and he generously allows you to use his service.\n\n> Could coinbase add an "in app purchase" and allow users to buy bits? \n\nI don\'t understand this question. Coinbase sells bits, they wouldn\'t need to add this as a feature.\n\n> I like the idea of scratch cards, could coinbase offer a scratch add (like App Store) and allow users to buy bits that way? \n\nYes, as I mentioned in another post GoGoCoin [is or was developing this](http://www.coindesk.com/gogocoin-partners-with-blockchain-give-away-btc-loaded-cards/) very feature, but I\'m not aware of the current status.': 1, '\xc2\xa31 worth?

': 1, '>Can I just buy \xc2\xa31 worth of Bitcoin from somewhere and just "have it" sitting in an app or an email or a USB or something or must I set up an account, which requires all my personal data (like a bank account) \n\nBitcoin exists by consensus - everyone agreeing on what all the balances are, and that they can\'t be changed without providing the right key. If anyone tried to "fiddle the books" they would come into disagreement with the consensus and everyone would ignore them. \n\nSo when you pay to have bitcoin transferred to an address of yours, everyone agrees that the transfer took place; everyone agrees that those coins are now yours, and everyone agrees that those coins can\'t go anywhere else without your say-so. You don\'t need to store them in an app or an email or a USB drive (actually you couldn\'t) because their very existence **is** that agreement.\n\nWhat you store for yourself is the crypto key that proves to everyone that you are who you claim to be, and that allows you to *spend* your coins. That\'s what wallet software stores and manages for you... that and the busywork of sending out transaction messages to the network. "Wallet" is really a bit of a misnomer; something like "keychain" would be more accurate to what it actually does, but the name has stuck at this point.\n\n***\n\n>Is it possible for me to own a bit of a bitcoin without having to give all my personal data to some company? \n\nHow much account setup and personal data is involved in the purchase depends on how and where you buy - the ID requirements are there to (a) ensure your payment is valid and won\'t be charge-backed after the event, and (b) to satisfy regulations. \n\nIf you arrange to meet someone and hand them cash they probably don\'t need to ID you - cash is cash no matter who you are, and there\'s no way to take it back. If you\'re sending a bank wire to an exchange they\'ll probably need some ID to satisfy regulators. If you\'re paying by credit card (or paypal or whatever - easily reversed payment methods) it would be foolish of them to *not* impose some ID requirements; otherwise every carder in the world would descend on them with fraudulently obtained funds.': 1, 'Wow - I\'m not sure what I said that you find to be hostile, but that certainly wasn\'t my intent.

If Bitcoin is Bitcoin, what a dogecoin etc I see in Google there is more than 1 type of Bitcoin or are those just different named companies who still only use the default Bitcoin but call it something different? \n\nBitcoin is open source source software - it can be compiled and distributed by anyone. In early 2013 it became popular to "tweak" this open source software and redistribute it under different names; dogecoin is one of the children of that process. For the most part, none of these cryptocurrencies are "companies", they are re-factored open source code. Bitcoin is the largest and most robust of these coins.

Correct?\n\nHowever, how do you get your bits from a change tip account to a wallet? I\'m still in there trying to figure that out at the moment? Once done I think I will take all my notes and write a dummy guide and also see how users can purchase bits easily.\n\nFor example. Could coinbase add an "in app purchase" and allow users to buy bits? \n\nI like the idea of scratch cards, could coinbase offer a scratch add (like App Store) and allow users to buy bits that way? I\'m going to investigate the easiest way to purchase bits without having to faff about with a bank account. As it seems to me, at the moment, it\'s difficult to get bits without having a physical bank account... At least that is my experience.\n\nI\'ll continue on and post back more info momentarily.': 1, 'You can use localbitcoins to get it from a regular person or you can use paypal to go through virwox but this is costs more and you have to first exchange it to linden dollars before you transfer it to Bitcoin so you sort of need to find the guide if you have never done it before': 1, 'That\'s interesting, I\'ll check out cold storage (his music is very good) :) and the other services mentioned.

Will changetip allow you to pay for services in the future? \nIf so that would be a very nice way to perform a transaction. That would be relatively seemless and as anonymous as a cash transaction for all intents and purpose. \n\nSo, next question. Other than buying from localbits and buying person to person.

(https://github.com/greenaddress/bips/blob/bip-payment-request-instant-confirmations/bip-payment-request-instant-confirmations.mediawiki)\n\nAs for anonymity, I haven't been asked by circle or coinbase for a picture ID.

One example would be for a seller and buyer to both use Coinbase's wallet. Then the bitcoin transfer between Coinbase wallets could be confirmed instantly (though escrow would be left out in this scenario).  \n\nIf you stick with a native Bitcoin transaction, I think waiting for six confirmations is excessive. One or two is probably plenty for typical amounts. Three or four is reasonable for somewhat larger amounts (remember each subsequent confirmation increases the security of the transaction exponentially).  \n\nIf using escrow, you could see if the seller would be willing to fund the escrow before the meet. Once you see that escrow is funded, there should be plenty of confirmations by the time you actually meet the seller. Then just show the cash and independently verify that escrow is released. The transaction itself would be essentially instantaneous. \n\nRegarding anonymity, regulated exchanges like Circle and Coinbase will always need to bow to the AML/KYC terms of the jurisdictions they operate in. You could always attempt to anonymize your coins after you receive them. Or if anonymity is your goal, you may consider a sketchier exchange like [BTC-e](https://btc-e.com/) which does not do verification of its users, though you'd still be trusting them not to log how your account was funded or that they're not infiltrated by the NSA. The surest way to preserve anonymity is probably still to mine your own bitcoins, but this would almost certainly be more costly then buying from Coinbase or Circle.
