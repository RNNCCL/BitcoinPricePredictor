This will surely be ironed out in due time if it hasn\'t already, but it\'s important to note.\n\nAlso note that even if your mnemonic phrase is constructed out of a weird word list, you\'ll still be able to retrieve your funds even if the wallet implementation goes down, because the code of either the wallet, or some implementation that can reconstruct the mnemonic phrase to a key will remain (open source and all that).\n\n----\n\n> - With my wallet, I sent some coins to another wallet, in Mycelium, and could see the balance of the original wallet in the transaction history.

Note though, that HD wallets do not reuse addresses, and given some number of transactions will have a completely obfuscated history, with a large number of transactions scattered throughout the system with no apparent relation to eachother. Address reuse (other than being insecure) will ruin your privacy, HD wallets somewhat solves that.\n\nOther options to increase your privacy are wallets that implement CoinJoin, such as DarkWallet, but this wallet is in Alpha and I wouldn\'t recommend using it right now. CoinJoin will mix your inputs and outputs with other users and there\'s no way to derive any information out of where the money in any given transaction came from.

This lock is a very strong lock, which can\'t be opened except if you have a single unique key that opens it (this is the private key). If you want to send information to a person and you want to be sure that no one else can read it, you take this lock (the person hands them out to anyone who wants them) and put its on the data. From that point on, no one can open the lock any more, except for the intended recipient, who is the only one who has the private key.\n\nWith regard to the network verifying that someone has the private key, the nodes are actually looking at the signature of the transaction. A transaction script contains two components, a signature and a public key. The public key must match the hash given in the script of the redeemed output. The public key is used to verify the redeemers signature, which is the second component. More precisely, the second component is an ECDSA signature over a hash of a simplified version of the transaction.

The buyer would need to acquire $500 billion worth of Bitcoin. The act of buying mass amounts of bitcoin would drive up the price of bitcoin insanely, but you'd eventually end up with $500 billion worth of bitcoin (and make some entrenched Bitcoin HODLers monetarily rich beyond imagining).

OTOH, complications arise if the seller would want to liquidate some large portion back to fiat immediately. If the buyer and seller make a sale requirement that the end value received by the seller *settled back to fiat is at least $500 billion*, sophisticated financial instruments may be needed to secure against volatility and guarantee this result.

The sum effect of all these invisible innovators is that Bitcoin acts like an aikido master to deflect and absorb the forces that act against it._\n\n_This all requires a little bit of faith to keep in mind because one has to believe in something that is not always visible, based on the rational expectation of its existence. But this is not so different from ordinary life: we know that the news gives us a biased sample of reality and we know that we must pay attention to what is seen and unseen. The only difference is how extreme the Bitcoin world is, how much pure FUD there is everywhere, both innocent and deliberate.

We estimate that one CXC will be valued at $1.00 after the 20th December, based on the value of an average transaction fee, therefore we believe that early buyers of the token can expect a prompt value increase.  \n\nSince all CXC tokens will be held by those who have acquired them before the 20th December 2014, supply will be limited whilst demand should increase so holders of CXC may also benefit from an additional increase in value in the long term.': 1, 'What do I need to do to start my very own exchange?
