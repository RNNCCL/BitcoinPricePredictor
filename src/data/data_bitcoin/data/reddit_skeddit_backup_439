Respectfully, you don't understand how micropayment channels work. \n\nNumber 1 is very flattering, but alas I believe it is not the case. \n\nSo that leaves us with #2. What you need to know is that when you use micropayment channels, you are NOT pushing transactions to the block chain every minute or second. For each stream only TWO (2) transactions are pushed to the blockchain: basically, one that holds the funds in escrow, and one that finally distributes the funds between the client and the provider. That's TWO (2) transactions per stream, no matter what the length/price/etc. of the stream. \n\nI hope this clears it up!

Most people probably aren't going to use paper wallets, and if they are they're not going to generate them in a manner that remains secure.\n\nI understand the parallels between bitcoin's nonreversibility and the nonreversibility of cash, but the reversible nature of creditcard transactions is only important to this discussion because of the parallels between a creditcard pin and a private key (both can be compromised by compromising the computer that they are stored on). \n\ntl;dr\nPhysical security != information security.": 1, "You could easily do them as PSA's.

Here's my verbal diarrhea on paper lol  \n  \nIn my mind this is the current disconnect   \n  \n- Vendors accepting Bitcoin, no education for customers or employees and minimal sales.       \n- Vendors don't care to educate consumers, it's timely and cost intensive, and would require a bit of design and custom pamphlets... Lots don't have the resources for this. \n- Bitcoin ATM's with no vendor promotion... people see the ATM, and don't know where to spend Bitcoins.  Visa versa, people see BTC accepting Business, don't know how to get started, don't know how to get a wallet etc.    \n  \n   \n   \nThis is a great opportunity for a brand to focus on connecting the community to the bitcoin ecosystem in their neighborhood. \n   \nAt ATM locations, signage and tangible take homes with retailers around accepting Bitcoin.

ALSO for encouragement, Bitcoin deals that are exclusive to BTC payments at retailers. These pamphlets could even double as paper wallets and be printed on a monthly basis, with estimated numbers for reach. They could be sponsored by specific brands based on the location and print schedule.      \n     \n2. Closely work hand in hand with Bitcoin retailers / ATM and local BTC services to host Bitcoin nights, either at a school, bar, or even rotate participating retailer businesses for bi-weekly Bitcoin meetups.

Now, we need to reach them 2 more times to even be considered, perhaps we target the same individuals with ads online, or during another time of the day when this segment is in another concentration.       \n\n4.  Reach merchants for merchant night and communicate the program and the importance of getting involved with a local movement that shares clients from similar demographics. \n  \nEach retailer, ATM and local BTC service could pay a monthly fee for distribution and printing services, and compensation for the bodies that are putting the design together and other overhead.  The return could be judged obviously by volume/service/transaction  comparisons, turn outs to Bitcoin nights, or could create other mediums for reference.      \n   \nBasically, just a group to get everyone involved locally, to bring resources together for cost effective promotions and marketing that brings each brand attention. \n   \n\nWill put more thought into this tomorrow.

Credit cards and PayPal can be built on top of Bitcoin just as it was built on top of cash.\n\nBitcoin is the cash foundation needed to build a more fair, efficient and robust financial system.  It is the foundation. Services like credit/charge backs will be built on top.\n\nMy father owned a women\'s clothing store.  He always loved it when customers paid cash.  Credit card companies fees were too high and didn\'t always pay out. \n\nFor the same reason, businesses will most likely prefer you paid Bitcoin directly to them in the future instead of it being processed through this "yet to be invented" payment processor that provides charge backs.\n\nBy the same token, that unease you feel walking down that city street with $2300 in your wallet is the same unease you should feel when holding 10 Bitcoin on your desktop in your un-passworded Bitcoin core wallet.\n\nBitcoin is cash.

For example, no one calls buying shares of a company that doesn\'t offer dividends "speculation" even though you\'re holding an asset you intend to sell in the future for dollars (the other asset in your definition).  \n\nSemantics aside though, I think that for bitcoin to succeed it needs to be more than "speculation" (your definition or mine), and I feel that\'s what dominates today\'s market.  In order to have a true value-add proposition, bitcoin needs to be a transaction medium, which I think it really can be, we just need more people to actually participate and demonstrate value rather than buy and hold.  Don\'t get me wrong, speculating may pay off with an inflated value, but that\'s a greater fools scenario and I don\'t really want to bank on convincing more people to buy bitcoin based on the hopes they\'ll become overnight millionaires.

What good would solving anything you listed bring to the world?\n\nAre you kidding me? What\'s the value in a ledger system that lets an ecosystem of FinTech apps seamlessly work together are compatible despite borders? How is that just a circular bitcoin problem/solution? Currently most FinTech products use USD yet all these USD services are completely isolated from one another. Maybe it\'s not a problem, but it\'s a situation that could be dramatically improved to make it easier for newcomers to create a service. \n\n*Btw, you never gave me an example of global FinTech services that pop up everyday without bitcoin to answer your statement: "New apps and services pop up on a daily basis just fine without Bitcoin." I could be wrong but it sounds like your just saying that to say that without realizing that it\'s not quite comparable.*\n\n\n> What good would solving anything you listed bring to the world?\n\nCreating a global alternative to the banking system that allows individuals to exchange value. With the rising hedging services, bitcoin ATMs, and bitcoin services: it\'s more and more possible and cheaper for a savvy unbanked individual to exchange value and use the digital economy. \n\nBonus point: works across the globe without regard for borders. \n\nThere can be 100 hedging services, 100 bitcoin atm services, 10000 bitcoin applications and it all makes for a richer ecosystem. \n\nAnother example of this is the BTM network:  There doesn\'t need to be 1 BTM company that goes global, as a network of BTMs created by different people and companies interoperate just fine.\n\nAre there more ATMs than BTMs? Do ATMs work with different banks?Yes of course *(albeit with fees)*, but that\'s not even the point of what I\'m saying. The decentralization of effort is the means of creating infrastructure but the compatibility is the solution because it makes the decentralized approach actually worthwhile. \n\n>  Internet\'s ARPANET forerunner...\n\nThat is nothing like ARPANET. That\'s like the internet. Where any website can link to and use functions (api) from other websites and servers. Each website isn\'t competing to be the only website that provides everything. Also there didn\'t exist widespread consumer devices that could utilize ARPANET which is dramatically different from bitcoin services. ': 0, "> what drives the price\n\nBefore we start talking about driving the price, let's first talk about making bitcoin a technology that is useful. For that to happen, we need developers to make apps and services that use bitcoin. The incentive to build these apps (whether or not they create a service that drives up the price) is whether or not people use these apps. \n\nIn the case of bitpay/coinbase, even if they don't create a price drive, they definitely create utility for the bitcoin network.\n\nAs an example:\n\n* Coinapult/Circle/Bitreserve/Coinjar lets the user hedge their bitcoin as stable currencies. Yet only allows bitcoin deposits/sends\n* A user can then spend their bitcoin at merchants/BTMs/bitcoin services \n\nIf there were no merchants, then there would be no reason to hedge your bitcoin. Yet once there are more and more places to spend and use bitcoin, it makes more sense to increase bitcoin apps for consumer stability and then further for consumer use.

Mainstream economists say that a good currency must have some devaluation so that it is *not* used as longterm store of value.  I did not think so before I started following bitcoin, but now I think they are right.  Something that tries to be both a currency and a safe investment will fail in both roles.\n\n> How accurately do you suppose this equation predicts the price of gold?\n\nThe equation yields the value of a currency *if there is no speculative holding*.  It is not even economics, just basic alegbra.\n\nGold is not a significant currency any more, so the equation yields a price close to zero.  In recent centuries, gold was not a good currency because it was *too* scarce, which led to hoarding (although it *was* continuously created, and will continue to be for the indefinte future).\n\nRight now, gold is also a bad investment because, like bitcoin, it does not generate new wealth.  Its price is mostly speculative, and therefore not pegged to anything; it may still rise, but it may also crash at any moment.  \n\nBitcoin\'s price has a "floor" value due to its use as a currency (10 $/BTC, by optimistic estimates and the currency value equation).  Gold\'s floor price does not depend on its use as a currency, but on its decoratie and industrial uses; what that price is exactly, I do not know.': 1, 'Some places work, like the cup cake bakery.

Consequently most of the young tech professionals are focused on everything but Bitcoin.\nThere are of course more than a few startups in the crypto space, I'm just saying is they're still the relative minority.\nFor this reason I'm not surprised Bitcoin isn't a popular payment option yet. People are more stoked on Apple Paying with their new watch.\nOf course we'd all like to see Bitcoin adoption here sooner than later. Andreas Antonopoulos says it all the time, the other 5 billion need Bitcoin way more than Silicon Valley does, so they'll likely be taking it mainstream first.\nMost techies I know in San Francisco still don't think they need Bitcoin.

New apps and services pop up on a daily basis just fine without Bitcoin.\n\nIn FinTech? And in a way where all the services in the ecosystem work seamlessly with one-another? I don't think so. But feel free to give me examples where I'm wrong. \n\nBut even with companies that spend a lot of money on their services: Google Wallet, Paypal, Venmo, Square, Transferwise, etc there exists competition to dominate the market and you can't use these apps with another. If you want to transfer money you have to be on the same service. \n\nYet let's look at hedged bitcoin services: Coinbase, Circle, Bitreserve, Coinapult, & Coinjar. All of these services allow you to hedge your bitcoin in a variety of stable currencies yet only allow spends as bitcoin. \n\nBecause of this, you can send dollars from one hedged account on Coinjar to a hedged account on Bitreserve.

Is bitcoin an experiment? Yes. But it is definitely making strides in the right direction. \n\nThe anti-sybil attack and persistant ledger is more valuable than just currency.

In the past year or two, I've actually seen younger lawyers (straight out of law school) make careers out of working in the regulatory space in-house, at Coinbase for example. These people were relative unknowns who started giving talks to groups and became experts by teaching and pontificating. Bitcoin law (like Sports or Entertainment Law) is probably all of the following (by no means exhaustive): Securities Regulation, Tax, Contracts, Property and Business Law. The crazy thing is, the law cannot keep up with bitcoin.\n\nIf you are an evening student and you want working in the bitcoin space a very likely scenario after graduation, I would certainly suggest you spend time to learn to code and contribute to your brother's start up while finishing up your JD and being licensed. Attend the bitcoin conferences and get yourself known.\n\nPick your brother's brain has to how you can help him out. Though Bitcoin core is written in C++, you can contribute to so many awesome projects in the higher level languages that are faster to learn. Best of luck!": 2, "*Started with Codecademy just to get my mind in the mindset. I did the HTML, JS, CSS, and Python tracks. I did this in about a month or two.\n\n*I decided on a platform I wanted to work on - iOS.\n\n*I found a great book from the Ray Wenderich called the iOS Apprentice http://www.raywenderlich.com/store/ios-apprentice. This guide in my opinion is the best learning tool out there. It walks you through coding 4 apps, line by line, with features like geo-location, working with an API, and a persistent data store. If you end up doing iOS development professionally, you'll likely find yourself consulting to his tutorials time and time again - they just show up in the Google searches.\n\n*As I kept working through the guide, admittedly I still had tons of gaps in my knowledge. Like, what the hell was a pointer? What's the point of subclassing something?! This is normal, and if you stay the course, it'll all come together. This was about month 5 or so.\n\n*I joined meetup groups related to iOS development and learning programming in general, and attended them.\n\n*I worked through Think Python (free), http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/. I think it's probably the best beginner Python book out there. The other one is over 1500 pages long isn't very helpful. At this time, I also flirted with https://inventwithpython.com, which as a book on cryptography. What's mind boggling is that part of the book covers the encryption that was considered military grade, and illegal to know just a few decades ago!\n\n*I found and entered a hackathon. Even if you don't feel totally comfortable with your skills yet, if there's one nearby, you should go. They have free food, swag, and people are generally friendly about things. But, by the time you get there, if you can do things like populate a list from an API, or POST or send emails out from the phone, or get the location of the user, you should be in good shape. In the hackathon I entered - it was a local one sponsored by ATT and the theme was social good. I ended up working with a team, and we won first place. It was simply a Pot Hole Reporter/Tracker to the city of Los Angeles. The fact that the app was working counted for quite a bit - something to keep in mind when you have time constraints. To give you an example of the other apps, here is the write up from two years ago. http://developerboards.att.lithium.com/t5/AT-T-Developer-Program-Blogs/AT-amp-T-Mobile-App-Hackathon-Social-Good-LA/ba-p/34898\n\n*Around this time, I had also put out my first app, that's essentially a toy app. It featured a list view with information of different eateries, and it did a bit of geolocation.\n\n*By now, I have surface level knowledge of Objective-C, its APIs, and superficial knowledge of Python and Javascript. I also had the win from the hackathon, and that app. To test the marketplace, I tried submitting a few resumes out even though I felt I was under qualified. One recruiter liked the fact I was a lawyer, and the rest was history, sort of.\n\n*Being on payroll meant that I now have the time to study programming full time. This was actually where I really got down to the nitty gritty, and when it eventually clicked. Given how aggressive the time line was for me to learn how to code, it's a given that my core learning extended even here to this point of employment. My work knew this to, obviously.\n\nThe above is probably a bit of a mess but, that's how I did it in a nut shell. Your learning never stops as a programmer, and that's one of the things I love about software development. Also, there's really no shortcut. You just have to be coding until it clicks by putting in the hours, whether it makes sense or not. Those bootcamp guys come out just as incompetent, but it's implied that they're autodidacts, and would be able to contribute once they start employment, or soon there after. \n\nTLDR: Codecademy, Ray Wenderlich iOS Apprentice, Hackathon, get an App on the App Store, start applying, 1 year.\n\nLastly, if anyone is wanting to learn to code (but have no ability), but want to be closer to the action as they're learning job wise, consider becoming a manual QA analyst. You get to work with developers, and you should be able to hone your coding ability to trying automate a few things. Web development shops have these gigs in relative abundance.": 2, 'Good on you for transitioning from the service industry to building something lasting.': 8, "That's funny because I'm 39, have been practicing law for 15 years, and have recently started trying to learn to code.

Basically, manual QA people go through the software to test to see if there are bugs, and report back to the developer and stakeholders about them. It's not a glamorous job, but it was a good place for me to have a job as I was learning how to develop.\n\nHere's a job search for example: https://www.ziprecruiter.com/jobs/new-york/new-york/manual-qa-tester": 1, 'In a nutshell, how DID you learn to code?': 1, "Awesome! That's a brilliant good move. Financially speaking, you'll come out ahead having made the move you did. Wish I was smart enough to have done that! If by the time you get out and having the coding down to employability, you wouldn't have experienced what I did when it came to making the transition and being underemployed for a bit - letting the loans balloon in interest.\n\nI still love law, and I don't necessarily think everyone should just leave law school or the profession, but the employment landscape for attorneys simply cannot absorb the amount of new lawyers coming out of the schools today (apparently the bar exam isn't barring enough people, I'd say it's literacy and technology that killed the profession - which I find hilarious). I may return in to practice one day, but it can't be in a rank and file capacity, and coding will probably be something I'll still do.\n\nTaking the bar and being admitted will give you quit a bit of credibility when in comes to business, and also politics/policy if you decide to pursue that route, even if you don't practice. Just ignore the haters who can't understand what you're doing.\n\nRuby is awesome, and they have a great community out there.\n\nThanks for taking interest!\n\n": 3, 'I was quite serious when I wrote the above.
