But that is simply not true. If the secondmarket bidder bid $675 only for 1000 coins, and the remaining 2000 coins only had bids of $200, secondmarket would take the average and bundle the bids into one single bid for the 3000 coins at ~$358.\n\nThe only way we could deduce the minimum auction price is if we had a collective sum of the highest bids for a total of 3k BTC via secondmarket, where their weighted average is then the minimum auction price.

At $10,000 per bitcoin you\'re talking about a market cap size of "only" 130 billion.  That\'s similar in value to a big company like Pepsi, Disney or VISA but small for a global currency.  As a currency, $10,000 per coin puts bitcoin in the range of regional currencies like those of Finland or Denmark.  At $130 billion bitcoin would be a global currency smaller than the top 20 world currencies and significantly smaller than the top 5 currencies which are measured in the trillions. \n\nBy the way, those top 5 currencies are where you get to the point of what everyone would recognize as a global currency.   For bitcoin to go up another factor of 10 to $100,000 it would have to start to challenge those trillion dollar global currencies and that I think would be difficult (but maybe not impossible if bitcoin really took off--after all, that\'s where the other global currencies are valued).\n\nFor more go here and click "Full Data Table" at the bottom of the page:\n\nhttp://www.coinometrics.com/bitcoin/mix\n': 2, 'Correct, he never did.': 1, 'Theres a higher chance the price will be $100 in 3 years.': -2, "I thought I was the only one.
