They can't read ahead at the beginning.  ": 5, '>The blockchain is a key part of the system that underlies recordkeeping and transactions for Bitcoin, the virtual currency. But there are much bigger opportunities ahead for this decentralized recordkeeping system.\n\n>In a session called \xe2\x80\x9cWhy Everybody Cares About the Blockchain\xe2\x80\x9d at the inaugural Techonomy Policy conference earlier this month, panelists emphasized repeatedly that the database holds tremendous promise for an array of uses in banking, conflict tracking, and voting, among other things. It was a wide-ranging discussion, reflecting the vast possibilities proponents see for this contemporary technology.\n\n>\xe2\x80\x9cWouldn\xe2\x80\x99t it be awesome if we had one universal ledger that we could use for everything and that was accessible to everybody?\xe2\x80\x9d said Jerry Brito, executive director of Coin Center. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, that is what the blockchain is. It\xe2\x80\x99s a decentralized and open ledger.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n>The blockchain\xe2\x80\x99s potential, its advocates say, extends across any industry or social activity where recordkeeping takes place. That is just about all industries and activities. Clearly, the blockchain can be used for more than buying and selling. A global network of computer users maintains the blockchain in a manner that might be thought of as like a Google database that\xe2\x80\x99s shared with everyone in the world. Entries are recorded in the ledger and can never be deleted or edited, because the system is by design only sequential. New transactions can be recorded, but old ones can never be erased.\n\n>Ledgers and databases today typically are centralized and only their owners can access and make changes to them. They are closed for reasons of security, but this means that the ledger operates solely with the owner\xe2\x80\x99s permission and that only these owners are considered trustworthy. Ledgers underpin much of the information infrastructure that society relies on today, including the banking system, web domains, and identity-management systems like passports or drivers\xe2\x80\x99 licenses.\n\n>But with the blockchain, its universal ledger means that direct transfers can occur instantly and without fear of manipulation, because there are no gatekeepers or middlemen to slow them down or meddle with them.\n\n>This promise of better recordkeeping enticed the Nasdaq stock exchange, which still keeps record with paper certificates, to give the blockchain a test run. In May, the exchange announced it would use the technology with its private-markets platform, which firms use as they ready for an initial public offering. The companies will be able to trade private shares in a pilot project using a ledger based on the blockchain. If it goes well, the exchange will expand its use to other platforms.\n\n>Because the fees to operate it are so low, the blockchain may also be used for banking services for the poor and those without ready access to financial institutions. There are 2.5 billion people without bank accounts worldwide, according to McKinsey, and many of these people are expected in the near future to start using smartphones, as just about all the affluent people in the world have already. Theoretically, these phones could be used to access the blockchain for banking, Brito argued. Cellular phones have already allowed people in the developing world to bypass intermediaries, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s to make and receive payments or to exchange health information. The reception to blockchain and Bitcoin overseas is better than in the United States, where it\xe2\x80\x99s often thought of as \xe2\x80\x9cMonopoly money,\xe2\x80\x9d because our financial systems are trusted and there is ready access to money.\n\n>\xe2\x80\x9cThe financial infrastructure here works. In other places it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d said Brian Forde, director of digital currency at the MIT Media Lab and until recently a technology expert inside the White House. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen you find governments and cities in crisis, you find more reception to this.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n>Digital copyrights could also be swapped on the blockchain. A hard copy of a book can be bought and resold today without copyright infringement. Not so with an e-book. Users are barred from transferring digital books to others. The blockchain could allow the easy transfer of digital assets.\n\n>\xe2\x80\x9cAnything that can be saved digitally can be saved in the blockchain irrevocably,\xe2\x80\x9d said Brad Burnham, managing partner of Union Square Ventures, a venture capital firm. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s public data managed by a private key,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, referring to the blockchain\xe2\x80\x99s sophisticated security features.\n\n>But this technology worries regulators because of its potential for misuse in black markets. Recently the U.S. Justice Department successfully prosecuted the founder of the Silk Road, an underground market where illegal goods were bought and sold with bitcoins. He was sentenced to life in prison after his service was used for drug deals and other illegal activity. Partly in response, New York recently issued a law to regulate digital currencies. Firms that use the currency must record personal information from their users so they can no longer operate anonymously. New York\xe2\x80\x99s so-called BitLicense is aimed at preventing money laundering, terrorism funding, and fraud. It also insists that companies operating Bitcoin-based services have at least $2.5 million in backing.\n\n>Panelist Burnham calls that a very shortsighted restriction. \xe2\x80\x9cI think regulators are prone to reduce risk,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe real crime is who will get hit? They\xe2\x80\x99re regulating entry because it now costs you $2.5 million to enter the market. That would be a real loss to society. I think the New York law overstepped and they missed a huge opportunity.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n>Panelists worry that other states might follow New York\xe2\x80\x99s lead and impose onerous regulations on the flourishing blockchain startup culture that would make it near impossible for new companies to succeed or for the community to grow. With the potential to create an enormous range of new and low-cost services for companies and private individuals, it would be a missed opportunity if this new industry were killed.': 5}, ('Bittorrent services?', 3): {"That's exactly the one I was looking for originally.

There was a missing break statement so it kept looping after selecting a peer to disconnect, that bug is now fixed.\n\nAs you are well aware, the current approach Bitcoin Core users to DoS attacks allows *anyone* to disable Tor for Bitcoin users *everywhere*, because Core will ban any IP that "misbehaves" and doesn\'t know that an IP is a Tor exit. So write a program that connects through every exit, triggers the misbehaviour logic, and boom - now Tor is blocked from the P2P network. This is a key issue that prevents bitcoinj from using Tor by default (Core does not even have a bundled Tor client so usage of it is largely theoretical).\n\nThis patch is a first step towards fixing this situation by de-prioritising peers instead of banning the IP entirely. So it\'s the opposite of what you are trying to claim.

After all, a very similar economic structure to Lightning already exists in the form of darkmarkets, who routinely operate off-chain transaction systems. Obviously "blocking access" isn\'t a big deal here, because you can choose what hub - what dark market - to join that like-minded people can voluntarily choose to participate in; the cryptography behind Lightning prevents the hubs from stealing your funds. What\'s important is that your ability to choose between hubs is preserved bu keeping layer0 of the Bitcoin system - the blockchain - decentralized and open to all on a non-political basis.': -1, "> But with these numbers in mind, you will see that the cost you gave in your example are way, way, way overestimated.\n\nI don't know how you can say that - it depends on how much usage there is, how much value people put on it and how much of an increase there is, none of which are known.\n\nBear in mind that the idea behind deliberately limiting capacity is that it's going to create a fee market which will be better at funding mining than abundant capacity, so for example if the limited-capacity world has 1% of the number of transactions as the abundant world, you need at least 100x the fee just to break even, then you need to jack it up even further to get the extra mining revenue that this system is supposed to provide.\n\nThe problem with this is that the high fees then break the assumption that you wouldn't need to trust the hubs because you always ultimately have a transaction that you can use on the blockchain, since there's no value to being able to use a transaction on the blockchain if the fees cost more than the transaction is worth.

So I cannot dispute those (or any other) numbers.  \n\nBut if you believe that the LN will work, could you please provide a consistent set of numbers -- BTC price, total number of LN users, cost of mining per day, average transaction fee, etc. --  that you think could be possible?\n\n': -1, '>  tarditional banking \n\nI think I like this term even better than "legacy banking"': 5, 'You submit a patch, first in some time.

Rather than attempting to understand this strange behavior instead the inbound connections are addressed; I cannot understand why.\n\nRather than deploying one of the previously discussed mechanisms for addressing inbound connection slot usage, the approach you deploy is a blacklist of tor exits; since an attacker could simply use 125 other IPs (or 125 tor exist which come to exist in the weeks after the release of the binary, for that matter-- or, in fact, a _single_ exit added after the blacklist snapshot), I cannot understand what you think this would actually accomplish. Above you say "goal is for DoS attackers to be scored as the least valuable" but that isn\'t what the patch does, it punishes all Tor users, attacker or not-- and wouldn\'t plausibly stop any kind of attacker that I can think of for more than a few minutes (especially once the list is a little out of date).\n\nNot only is the blacklist static its both centrally administered and over-broad-- even at the instant it was created (including punishing tor hosts that will not exit to the node in question or to bitcoin at all).\n\nThen the implementation was didn\'t actually work like it was described, instead it immediately kicked off all blacklisted peers when the connection limit was hit.  A fact that two reviewers independently spotted; evidence that we took the non-trivial time and effort to actually review the software. (Even though I even though  considered the blacklisting approach a non-starter; I still read it with enough care to understand its actual behavior).\n\nSpecific, concrete recommendations were made to make this approach less of a disaster (including fixing the above misbehavior); and work began on another approach that doesn\'t involve any blacklists or excessively prejudicial behavior towards Tor;  that patch isn\'t posted yet because it needs to be finished and tested before being made a pull request. The advice was offered constructively and politely-- even suggesting that the approach could have utility on the network were it deployed on just a subset of nodes.\n\nSo here we see a pull request on seemingly untested, vulnerable code, which was predicated on centralized blacklisting, prejudicial to users of Tor, offered with dogmatic insistence while ignoring others work and you have responded to with incivility and ad homenem even towards those who pointed out the serious flaws in the implementation, dismissing their considered review which uncovered a serious flaw in your patch as tendered.\n\nYou really can\'t resist any possible avenue to attack Peter, either, can you?  Here he offered a constructive take on this that was surprisingly positive.  Propaganda would have been something like "Mike promised you big Blocks, but what he didn\'t tell you is what, precisely, he\'d be blocking: Turns out its Tor.".-- and, personally, and especially after seeing your response here I think it would have been completely deserved.\n': 8, 'Why am I not surprised to see propaganda from Peter Todd here?\n\nHere\'s what the patch does: if a node runs out of resources and has to choose, it chooses to serve non-Tor connections before Tor connections. Simple as that. The reason is, it\'s trivial to jam the entire network today via Tor by simply connecting to every single peer over and over again until they\'re all full - at this point starting wallets would fail.\n\nThis attack has been observed happening for real, on the main network, though fortunately whoever did it didn\'t try and jam every node.\n\nThe patch fixes this by introducing a notion of priority; some connections are more valuable than others. The goal is for DoS attackers to be scored as the least valuable of all, so if they attempt to consume all the network\'s resources, they will fail and legitimate users will still be OK. This is the only correct way to handle DoS in the long run, the current approach Core takes is banning IPs that \'misbehave\', but that\'s insufficient and actually makes it (doh) harder to use Tor, as anyone can misbehave from behind Tor exits and get them all banned.\n\nNotice how "Bitcoin Core\'s adherence to principles" involves a lot of redundant comments that anyone could have made because words are cheaper than code, ignoring the fact that the current approach makes Tor usage highly fragile, and a vague insistence on a better solution up front without any interest in evolving towards one in steps. Exactly the behaviour I\'ve come to expect from them.': 9, '> Because you did not read what I wrote \n\nI did read what you wrote. I also read what the software did.\n\nYour text can easily be read (and I did read it that way) there there was an issue with the node being jammed due to a third party by "using all its resources" which is not the case, as far as we know.\n\n> Which is exactly the same behaviour they get today!\n\nThe patch does change behavior or otherwise it wouldn\'t exist.\n\n> And yes, the patch was tested, with a program that connected to my local node via Tor.\n\nIt isn\'t sufficient to just test the cases you expect.

Though I did urge that if you shipped this (IMO ill-advised) patch in your own software that you fix some of its more grave short-comings. \n\n> It is not an all-singing, all-dancing solution to every imaginable attack.\n\nUnfortunately, it\'s not even a meaningful improvement to the problem it claimed to address.  The attacker need not even revise their software, they simply need wait for the tor exit list to bitrot which it will do over the coarse of a couple of weeks in the software release pipeline. \n\n>  it should be drama free\n\nThat you think that a big static list of tor exits to deprioritize would be drama free is only unsurprising in the context of your past actions.

You have a crown. What does it imply in your hands? It is, as it were, the witness and proof that you have, at some time or other, performed some labour, which, instead of profiting by it, you have bestowed upon society in the person of your client. This crown testifies that you have performed a service for society, and, moreover, it shows the value of it. It bears witness, besides, that you have not yet obtained from society a real equivalent service, to which you have a right. To place you in a condition to exercise this right, at the time and in the manner you please, society, by means of your client, has given you an acknowledgment, a title, a privilege from the republic, a counter, a crown in fact, which only differs from executive titles by bearing its value in itself; and if you are able to read with your mind\xe2\x80\x99s eye the inscriptions stamped upon it you will distinctly decipher these words:\n\n>\xe2\x80\x9cPay the bearer a service equivalent to what he has rendered to society, the value received being shown, proved, and measured by that which is represented by me.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n>Now, you give up your crown to me. Either my title to it is gratuitous, or it is a claim. If you give it me as payment for a service, the following is the result: \xe2\x80\x93 your account with society for real satisfactions is regulated, balanced, and closed. You had rendered it a service for a crown, you now restore the crown for a service; as far as you are concerned, you are clear. As for me, I am just in the position in which you were just now. It is I who am now in advance to society for the service which I have just rendered it in your person. I am become its creditor for the value of the labour which I have performed for you, and which I might devote to myself. It is into my hands, then, that the title of this credit \xe2\x80\x93 the proof of this social debt \xe2\x80\x93 ought to pass. You cannot say that I am any richer; if I am entitled to receive, it is because I have given. Still less can you say that society is a crown richer, because one of its members has a crown more, and another has one less. For if you let me have this crown gratis, it is certain that I shall be so much the richer, but you will be so much the poorer for it; and the social fortune, taken in a mass, will have undergone no change, because as I have already said, this fortune consists in real services, in effective satisfactions, in useful things. You were a creditor to society, you made me a substitute to your rights, and it signifies little to society, which owes a service, whether it pays the debt to you or to me.

Those resources have been irreversibly spent. \n\nBitcoin has value because it has good monetary properties which meets people\'s needs. It happens to roughly equal the cost of mining because we are still in the inflationary stage during which there is incentive to mine coins even at near-zero profit margin. If the value gets much ahead of the mining cost, mining effort will increase (but unlike gold, supply will stay the same) until it returns to equilibrium. Fucking brilliant!\n\nThe first chapter of The Wealth of Nations goes into a lot of detail as to how money evolved and what makes good money. If you can follow how we progressed from corn and sea shells to gold (periodically getting sidetracked into the disaster of fiat), then you can see how crypto is the perfect money.\n\nGoing off on a bit of a tangent here: Smith identified gold as excellent money, but recognized that it would be problematic for developing countries to bootstrap themselves using gold as currency, because they would first have to expend the resources to obtain gold before they could have good money to circulate. Especially true in the case of a nation with bad dirt - not much gold to be mined. Mining gold when you\'re starving is obviously wasteful and counterproductive, and in this case he cautiously conceded that notes would be a suitable compromise to get domestic trade going.\n\nBitcoin solves this problem because a new cryptocurrency "nation" can start with virtually zero expense and without having to issue debt - any new cryptocurrency can be launched with a few mouse clicks. It is only once it catches on that the miners need to be paid well. Bitcoin solved a known problem that Smith identified 250 years ago!': 2, 'Assuming for a moment that the electricity could be transmitted to the buyer... and that a buyer would want to pay any premium for a fungible commodity....\n\nIf that one miner trades him the electricity instead of using it to mine, then the total mining effort goes down by a smidgeon. Now scale this up to many miners choosing to sell electricity instead of mining... as total hashing work decreases, profitability goes up for the remaining miners. Eventually the trade becomes unattractive and the miner goes back to mining. \n\nSo one miner might take that deal. But in aggregate, the market applies pressure towards whatever hash rate / price point at which it makes sense to burn electricity to get BTC.': 1, 'Excellent post. And to take it one step further, we should exchange all of our fiat-denominated assets and derivatives (pensions, bank balances, gold certificates) for hard assets (property, bitcoin, physical gold) only keeping enough fiat to live day-to-day.': 1, "I could accept that if it meant just a store of some useful labor but to burn coal on all the power and hashing ... it's also a drain of labor.": 0, '> You were a creditor to society, you made me a substitute to your rights, and it signifies little to society, which owes a service, whether it pays the debt to you or to me. This is discharged as soon as the bearer of the claim is paid.\n\nI think the idea being communicated is that fundamentally, in this view, money is debt. It is a societal IOU for the original labor that it was meant to represent. When you hold a dollar in your hand, you are holding a note that indicates that society owes you one dollar worth of labor, that is, society is indebted to you. On the other hand, that dollar represents a financial asset for you, in the same way a mortgage is a financial asset for the bank, since now you are owed. \n\nSo in his view, money is debt. It is a special kind of debt, perhaps, in that all of society is indebted to this particular financial asset (whereas with the mortgage, only the home owner is indebted to it). So just like with any form of debt, there can be default. That is, in a sense, what inflation is -- the gradual defaulting on the original labor due. \n\nIt is interesting to consider the possibility that bitcoin isn\'t really this type of money. That is to say, it isn\'t a financial asset in the sense of being debt born out of an IOU social contract. It isn\'t a financial asset, it is a digital hard asset (and perhaps the first of its kind). Hard assets are things like a house or gold. Their value doesn\'t depend on the promise of someone to pay. The value of a mortgage lies in the promise to pay from the home owner. The value of a Treasury Bond lies in the promise of the government to pay in the future. These are financial assets, and their value derives from someone\'s promise to pay (i.e., debt). But if you own a house, its value is intrinsic to the house itself, in a sense. \n\nThis is why so many people focus on the perceived lack of intrinsic value in bitcoin, and why many are starting to realize that the "intrinsic" value lies in its use as a secure distributed ledger. Should that ledger become widely used, then the units that make the ledger work take on intrinsic value. It is, perhaps, the foundation for a different paradigm than the debt-based one of the past.\n\n ': 2, ':D': 5, "No it's not, its equally stored labour": 1, "You know u've been reading /r/bitcoin too long when...u get this reference and laugh": 2, 'Oh my god, look at all the money nerds in this thread': 1, 'Labor theory of money is archaic and debunked.
