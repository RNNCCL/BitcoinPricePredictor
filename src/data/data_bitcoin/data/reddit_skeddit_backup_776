Tor, which is partly funded by the U.S. government, is used by dissidents in authoritarian countries such as Iran, China and Saudi Arabia to access the Internet, but people operating and visiting websites that sell contraband also use it to conceal their identities.\n\nInternet security experts said it was unlikely authorities had cracked Tor\xe2\x80\x99s sophisticated encryption protocols. \xe2\x80\x9cIf that were the case, the implications would be huge,\xe2\x80\x9d said an official with Welund Horizon, a London firm that provides intelligence on cybercrime to law-enforcement agencies and large corporations.\n\nThat law enforcement was able to locate Tor users is \xe2\x80\x9ca game changer,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ulf Bergstrom, a spokesman for Eurojust, the European Union\xe2\x80\x99s legal coordination agency. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re not anonymous anymore when you\xe2\x80\x99re using Tor.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAuthorities are continuing to target other so-called \xe2\x80\x9cdarknet\xe2\x80\x9d websites that traffic in illegal goods and their customers, said Troels Oerting, director of the European Cybercrime Centre in The Hague, which with the Federal Bureau of Investigation and U.S. Justice Department directed this week\xe2\x80\x99s actions.\n\nThe Tor Project Inc., a nonprofit group behind Tor, said it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know exactly how investigators located the users. Court documents and statements made public this week \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t disclose enough details to be useful for technical diagnosis,\xe2\x80\x9d said Andrew Lewman, executive director of the Tor Project. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re continuing to investigate.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis could all be simple old-fashioned police work in action,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\nMr. Lewman added his organization doesn\xe2\x80\x99t condone the use of Tor for illegal activities.\n\nA U.S. official involved in the investigation said this week\xe2\x80\x99s actions were targeted at online marketplaces for contraband, not the Tor network. \xe2\x80\x9cPeople felt like Tor is all I need to be safe, so after that they were pretty open about\xe2\x80\x9d illegal activity, the official said.\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re still working very hard and it certainly hasn\xe2\x80\x99t become easy,\xe2\x80\x9d the official said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I think we do want people to be aware that we will work very hard and we will overcome that obstacle in order to stop serious crime.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nWhile law enforcement is more adept at tracking down Tor users, challenges remain.\n\nAuthorities seized 414 website domains that provide access to marketplaces for illegal drugs, weapons and even contract killers, said Eurojust. Authorities arrested 17 people connected to the websites and seized computers, bitcoins worth $1 million and \xe2\x82\xac180,000 ($224,000) in cash, drugs, gold and silver.\n\nThe crackdown ensnared Blake Benthall, a California man who was arrested on Wednesday and charged with owning and operating Silk Road 2.0., one of the largest darknet marketplaces. In addition to the arrest of Mr. Benthall, 16 others have been arrested in the probe, including two people in California, two in Sweden, one in Ireland, eight in the U.K., one in Spain, one in Switzerland and one in Hungary, a spokesman for the U.S. Justice Department said.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis case is a landmark in the continuing battle against cybercrime,\xe2\x80\x9d said Koen Hermans, a Dutch official who works with Eurojust. \xe2\x80\x9cIt marks the beginning, not the end, of the pursuit of those who abuse the Internet for illegal profit.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSome of the larger darknet marketplaces remained online Friday, including Evolution, the expert from Welund Horizon said. In an indication of how difficult policing the darknet is, one of the marketplaces that may have been shut down, Alpaca, was up and running again on Friday through a different host, the expert said.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll probably see Silk Road reappearing very soon,\xe2\x80\x9d the expert said.\n\nTor hides users\xe2\x80\x99 identities by detouring their traffic around the world before it reaches its final destination. It also is used to skirt censors in countries such as China. Privacy-minded researchers, crooks and spies have long probed Tor for weaknesses.\n\nTor stands for \xe2\x80\x9cthe onion router.\xe2\x80\x9d It is managed by a nonprofit group in Cambridge, Mass., and worked on by a dispersed group of programmers. It was originally developed to protect the communications of the U.S. Navy and still is partly funded by the U.S. government. Because of Tor, the identities of the web-companies and servers that host dark websites are supposed to be impossible to locate.\n\nOfficials wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t comment on how authorities got around Tor. Arrests are coming of those who buy goods from these websites, Mr. Oerting said. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99ll get a knock on their doors,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThat will not be the milkman, that will be the police.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe sites shut include Hydra and Cannabis Road, Eurojust said.

Yes it is is https://freenetproject.org/.\n\nIt would be totally awesome if OpenBazaar used Freenet.\nIMHO, Freenet is a better foundation for new services than Tor or I2P. Tor and I2P both sort of aim at fixing the existing, centralized model of having a big server somewhere which handles everything: They try to make a *single* exit point anonymous. While it is really nice to allow people to access existing Internet services in an anonymous way, this cannot be as secure as a truly decentralized solution where there is no *single* exit point but many.\nAnd thats where Freenet is a possible solution: In Freenet, not the machine hosting the data is the "exit point", but the data *itself*. That means that a Freenet address points to the data, not to the server. Each Freenet user automatically is a "small" server, and Freenet hosts the data on the machines of the users. If data is popular, it gets distributed to more machines automatically. So it doesn\'t matter if a single machine dies! The data will stay available.\n\nI think its obvious that this is a more strong security model. So given that OpenBazaar is a new project, it doesn\'t have to go for the existing model of central servers, and it would be nice if it went for Freenet :)\n\n(This does not aim to offend Tor/I2P developers: Putting existing software to more use is a good idea, and a benefit to everyone. But it doesn\'t mean that new software should use the same technical model, this would only lock it down to the limited ability of a model for making old software work in an anonymous way)\n\nAlso, we can offer lots of libraries which would make the work of OpenBazaar easier: There already *is* a system for rating they trustworthyness of users (Web Of Trust). There *is* a system for private messaging / private data traffic (Freemail). And also, we already have forum systems, which IMHO are almost the same as a market: A thread = a product offer. A thread reply = a bid. So technically, OpenBazaar devs wouldn\'t have to re-invent the whole thing as they probably have to with Tor / I2P.\n\nSee https://wiki.freenetproject.org/Projects for sub-projects of Freenet.\n\n**TL;DR**: In my personal opinion, Freenet is the better technical solution for OpenBazaar than Tor/I2P because Tor/I2P are aimed at making legacy software anonymous, and thus take tradeoffs in security / decentralization. Also, the existing Freenet libraries cover huge parts of what OpenBazaar needs anyway (trust management / communication).\n\n**By the way: We also accept Bitcoin donations :)** https://freenetproject.org/donate.html': 13, 'Why should anyone believe that some anonymous person on the internet will live up to the promise?': 6, "Freenet is the way to go.

Dollars are valuable because human beings GIVE them value.  We decide, mutually, that dollars are worth food and gasoline.\n\nHowever, A US dollar gains this value because its supply is more carefully controlled than many other currencies out there (see many third world nations) **and** it has the power of the government to threaten anyone with punishment who might try to counterfeit or undermine it\xe2\x80\x99s value.  To put that another way...the US dollar is backed by the THREAT OF VIOLENCE.  This threat is what has ultimately given the dollar value in the eyes of humans.

Not only because it eliminates the need for centralized authorities to regulate currency with the threat of violence, it also removes the ability of a very small group of people (Governments and central bankers) to have control over the currency from a central location and thus exercise a very abnormal amount of power over the entirety of monetary policy.\n\n\n\n ': 16, 'Must be ;)': 1, 'Mini Italian lesson:\n\n"A biscotto / un biscotto"\n\n"Some biscotti / dei biscotti"\n\n': 6, 'The Bitcoin tip for 5,812 bits ($2.00) has been collected by *NonViolentWar*.\n\n\n[ChangeTip info](https://www.changetip.com/tip-online/reddit) | [ChangeTip video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AnfKpypMNw) | /r/Bitcoin': 2, "Well since the Bible is a collection of many books why don't we just wrap up the a bunch of classics and call it the Western Cannon.

Until the majority vote for legalization saying a law is "wrong" and doing it anyway doesn\'t hold water.\n\nIt is a moral issue, I\'d certainly agree. But I\'d say that the \'war on drugs\' (addressing the US more specifically here) has nothing to do with morality. Polticians parrot morality as their basis for the \'war on drugs\' but they had no moral qualms when they made marijuana or opiates illegal. They made it illegal to attempt to create a negative perception of Mexicans and Chinese. \n\nMoreover, when the solution involves having the highest prison population in the world and spending massive amounts of money on this for decades with no results? I\'d consider that a highly immoral system if it were allowed to continue to exist.\n\nSo for me, it comes down to the moral question of -- is an oppressive government spending my tax money on preventing me from exercising personal liberty being moral or not? I\'d suggest that they are being an immoral agent and an agent for active harm when they do not look at drugs on a factual basis. They use drugs as a political tool. When this happens, drugs turn into propaganda and lies become okay in the \'war on drugs\'...\n\nI do not think that society has really gotten the chance to \'collectively\' vote on any of these policies in a real meaningful way. Governments have actively resisted it every step of the way with all the might they possibly can (including lies and propaganda). Drugs were already illegal when I was born and it has taken from my birth to now for weed to START to become legal. That is 33 years for reference. \n\nSo rather than waiting another 50 years for political thought to catch up to demonstrable truth, I think the greatest thing one can do to oppose immoral laws is ignoring them. It gives others courage to do the same and resist oppressive governments. \n\n> Do you believe society would be better off if drugs like heroin and meth were easily accessible and used by a large percentage of the population?\n\nThat\'s a difficult question because I do not have all of the answers. Should they be \'easily accessible\'? No. Certain age limits, certain dosage, and highly regulated/taxed. The goal would be to help get those people NOT using Heroin but not force them to by using the criminal justice system. That\'s why by making it a health issue, it would make it so the drug users wouldn\'t be afraid to turn to the state for help in fear of reprisal. Heroin and meth are gross and the government should actively fight to reduce their usage. Keeping drugs criminal for the last 50 years hasn\'t done this, it\'s time to change tactics.': 2, "That's a ratter complex issue actually.\n\nI'm all for light drugs to be legal, then again I'm completely against hard drugs.\n\nI think it's one of those issues where there is no correct answer.

That way you have a wide group of people who can review the code, where problematic items can be caught. Indeed a bug in Bitcoin's early history Satoshi had missed was caught. Most people would probably agree known coders, like Gavin for example, are trustworthy. Such coders then often sign the files they make available for download so they can be checked by anyone to ensure the files haven't changed. The only vulnerability there would be if the coder's signing key was compromised.\n\nThe second problem is with online sites that are deemed trustworthy, but which may be compromised.

Note, one address could contain many piles of bitcoins, think of it as a wallet with many notes with different face values, but you will normally only get to see the total value in this particular wallet if you don\'t dive into the blockchain, such a wallet in Bitcoin jargon is called an address, a multi-address combo in Bitcoin is called a \'wallet\' instead, you will get used to it.(if you haven\'t)\n\n2.Your client then combines enough of these piles to create a bigger pile that contains just enough bitcoins to pay your beneficiary, then it signs the value, the original piles create it, and the destination address\'s public key with your private key, so anybody can verify that you authorize the destination address to receive your bitcoins, just as those who sent them to you did, this is your(unconfirmed) transaction.\n\n3.Then you broadcast/shout to the world, that your transaction is coming, all the full nodes in the world than forward your transaction to everyone they connect with, including miners, in about 10 seconds time, nearly every miner in the world should know you need to do this transaction, then they verify that you indeed sign/authorize your beneficiary to receive these bitcoins that up to this second indeed belong to you, and put it in their memories, and carry on mining.\n\n4.Now why do they mine? Because we expect there to be only one version of the ledger recording every transaction, if there are two versions, you can show one person one version of the ledger, convincing him you have this much money to pay him, and after you pay him, you show another person the other version of the ledger, where your last transaction is not recorded and your balance remains the same, so she will accept your payment as well, until someday they meet and figure out your trickery, but by then you will have already run off with their goods. Now since this is the one and only ledger/blockchain, at any time there must be only one entity in charge of writing it, but what\'s the fair way to decide whom to write it? Satoshi settled on using a mechanism called "Proof of Work", that is, every miner(accountant) gets to solve a math problem in 10 minutes or so, whoever is the first to do that, will get to write the page of ledger for these 10 minutes, along with some BTCs as his reward, also the problem is designed so that those who compute fast will have a higher chance of being the first, but no one will get the monopoly, everyone has a chance to hit the jackpot, with the chance dependent on his computing power. The difficulty of the problem will also adjust depending on the total computing power of the nodes in the network.\n\n5.After a while some lucky dude finds an answer to the problem for the current difficulty, and he decides to include your tx(maybe you paid a decent fee) in his page of the ledger(block) and publish it, all the miners in 10 seconds will get his block, as long as none of them has solved a harder problem at this point, they will continue to work on his block(yeah his answer and your transaction is part of the next problem, that\'s why it\'s called a chain and how your transaction also gets into everyone\'s book), because they know, that\'s the chain everyone will recognize, since the ledger that contains the answers to the most difficult problems, is the one that will stand out be considered most reliable, as there is no other way to tell which of a possibly myriad of chains is legit.\n\n6.Now your beneficiary can verify that your bitcoins to him is included in the most difficult blockchain, the one with most computing power behind it, he will feel safe and let you collect the goods.': 3, 'The Bitcoin tip for a biscotti (728 bits/$0.25) has been collected by *oakpacific*.\n\nBonus: [an image from /r/bitcoin](http://i.imgur.com/d2Dy8YR.png)\n\n\n[ChangeTip info](https://www.changetip.com/tip-online/reddit) | [ChangeTip video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AnfKpypMNw) | /r/Bitcoin': 1, 'The Bitcoin tip for a biscotti (728 bits/$0.25) has been collected by *readyou*.\n\nBonus: [an image from /r/bitcoin](http://i.imgur.com/d3jvbSj.jpg)\n\n\n[ChangeTip info](https://www.changetip.com/tip-online/reddit) | [ChangeTip video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AnfKpypMNw) | /r/Bitcoin': 1, 'Should I ask tommorow? :)': 1, 'I wouldn\'t call myself a Bitcoin beginner.

I ask this question as I thought some people could give me a better understanding. I don\'t understand what the system of miners do in that process. I know that one address sends informations to an open ledger called blockchain and when it\'s proccessed, it\'s forwared but the whole transaction is still visible in the ledger. What I do now wonder... when the transaction is in the ledger, it is waiting to be processed and signed, I assume this is what miners do? As you can see, my knowledge is even after researching very vague and I asked this question to get a better idea because I know that some people here can come up with very nice explanations and if I still don\'t understand, I can ask for ELI5. So, what I still don\'t get to 100% is the whole technical process that works behind a transaction. When I asked Google another day, I got all kind of results and after reading it looked to me that a lot of people don\'t get it right. There are at least several articles out there where it is explained different than in another article. And then I found a couple of articles that write it like "it\'s goes in the blockchain and transaction is done after that", but that doesn\'t help me much to understand it.

Open to feedback:\n\n* Add the word \'private\' to most tips to keep threads tidy.\n* Try to tailor fun [custom monikers](https://www.changetip.com/tip-amounts) to the communities you\'re tipping in.\n* This isn\'t just about collecting tips. It\'s about *giving* tips.\n* Tips of higher value make a much better impression outside of giveaway threads.\n* If somebody clearly does not want to be tipped, do not tip them, even as a joke.\n* **Do not engage in drive-by tipping sprees.** It really pisses people off and mucks up the works, and is the primary reason why some people have been banned from other subreddits \'for tipping\'. \n* Find original content, share some insight, then leave a tip at the end.\n* Different communities have different minimum tip standards.\n 1. All tip amounts are welcome in /r/ChangeTip, /r/BitTippers, and /r/FreeBits. Go subscribe!\n 2. In /r/Bitcoin, we need to aim for *at least* 100 bits, but preferably $.25 or more.\n 3. When tipping anywhere else on reddit, I cannot stress enough how important it is to tip *at least* $1.00, because any less will almost always leave a bad impression since they\'re most likely not accustomed to microtransactions. If you\'re not sure how it will be perceived, you can always ask first, and/or use the \'private\' function.\n\nIf you get banned for tipping, don\'t harass the moderators of that subreddit! I talked to the /r/EarthPorn mods yesterday and they\'re really good guys. They were mostly just irritated that people were harassing them in mod mail. Not cool! We concluded that the issue was absolutely not because of \'tipping\', but because a user had gone on a rapid-fire tipping spree which triggered about 20 bot responses, trashing the thread and derailing the discussion. It\'s like if somebody breaks into your house, jumps on all your shit and throws money at you.  You\'d be like, "um, thanks, but what the fuck?!"  I haven\'t looked into the /r/trees banning but that sounds like it may have been the same thing. Changetip is *perfect* for /r/trees, so I hope the mods are as cool as the /r/EarthPorn crew.': 6, "You can tip big to a beggar if you want. It's just going to encourage more begging.": 1, 'Perfectly valid criticism in my opinion. The solution to rejected tips is generally not moar tips.\n\nTaking a closer look, not on mobile, the only saving grace for /u/steveds123 is that it was his own thread. But his text says, "Just want to know what everyones preferences is?", when in reality it should be, "Just want to tip you kthx." \n\nIf he had been more transparent about his intentions and tipped reasonable amounts, I wouldn\'t take issue with it. Additionally, what he SHOULD have done was make custom monikers of sufficient value for the actual drinks people responded with, then tip "1 jack and coke", "3 fingers whiskey", etc. Good idea, terrible execution.\n\n/irritated': 2, "I'm not convinced Changetip Tuesday is going to work in the long run without some proper guidelines. Short term, yes, it's generating a lot of attention. But people are tipping for the sake of tipping & not as much the material/content. In the long run, it will be treated as spam.\n\nI think we should just tip the owner of good original/entertaining content/well thought out posts, and *encourage* people to create good original/entertaining content and reward them for it. Avoid tipping reposts (wait an hour or two and you'll know people are posting reposts via thread comments).\n\nAlso think about tips for services. Said service could be just a guy linking the video you needed, or something you asked for.\n\nStop tipping unoriginal content, common memes (unless it's a meme subreddit), or beggers.
