The price goes to 300. You feel bad because you lost 7500 $.\n- You buy 10 000 $ now, the price goes to 300. You lost 2500 $ but you can buy 10 000 $ of Bitcoin at 300 so you are less sad and you are also happy you can buy even lower and you still have 10 000 $ to buy at 200 or at 400 (the price at which you would have invested your 30 000) if the price goes up again.\n\n- Now let's say instead of going to 300$ the price goes to 500$, well you can buy 10 000 $ more at 500. You will be happy because you will be making 6600$ on your 10 000$ and you can still buy 10 000$ more of bitcoin, you will just have a little bit less. If the price falls back to 400 or less, you can buy your remaining 10 000 $ as you could do if it goes to 600.\n\nAn even easier way would be to split your investment in 12 equal sum. And Invest the same day every month in 2015.\n\nMost human being are more impacted by a loss than by missing out on a gain. And the worst emotion when investing is suffering from a loss. So it's better to minimize your suffering so you don't end up selling your 30 000 $ of bitcoin at 250 because you can't take it anymore just before it shoots up to whatever 500 ++.\n\nSome people also fail to understand that Bitcoin is the type of investment that is better seen as a potential risk of 100% loss and and unlimited upside while undergoing crazy volatility. In this case I strongly advise against having a stop loss strategy (I.e Telling yourself, if the price goes to 200 I sell). It's better to ride it to 0 or to the moon and to ignore price action. Make sure to understand this BEFORE buying your bitcoins.\n\nFinally On how much of your 100 000 USD you should invest. Well it depends on how hard it is for you to replace these USD if you lose them. It could be as little as 5% or as much as 100% depending on these conditions. Personally I find the 1% advice idiotic, as if you really have such a low confidence in your picks, you should stay away from investing yourself in the first place. \n\nIt's nice to not put all your eggs in the same basket, but spreading your capital on  dozens of assets  that you don't know anything about is not good risk managment. What is important is how correlated your picks are. 4-10 picks of assets that are not too correlated seems more sensible to me.\n\nIf bitcoin does 10X on 10% of your capital, you will have doubled your capital on Bitcoin alone. If you lose everything, anyone will recover quite easily from a 10% loss. If Bitcoin does 10X on 1%, you will have made 10% which is really a waste when very few assets in your life will give you 1000% gains.\n\nOne last thing: Bitcoin maybe not only be a growth play but it could also (potentially) act as a form of defensive asset akin to gold. Let's say your broker or bank is going under. Who knows what you are going to get back. Let's say your saving currency is getting overprinted, who knows what value you will be getting out of it. Bitcoin might be protecting you in these cases. Personally I'd be totally comfortable holding 25% or even more of my asset in Bitcoin because of this. As a form of insurance against currency devaluation and third party risk.\n\n": 4, 'At coinbase you can setup recurring buying...  so you could buy a little everyday.': 2, "Thanks I'll read that": 1, "Why would someone wanna do that?
