Saying that they "reject" any community-proposed action reinforces this impression, whereas I believe this is largely untrue. I\'ve even seen comments reflecting the belief that "51%" or some other amount of wide miner consensus would be required. The truth is all elements of the Bitcoin community will decide on the success of a branch after a hard fork. Even in an extreme scenario of say 90% of miners supporting one branch, if the rest of the community supports the other (merchants, end-users -- essentially those that hold much of the value in Bitcoin or make it useful), the branch having far less hashing power may still end up succeeding. It\'s overall security would be dramatically weakened initially, but realistically, because miners have the majority of hashing power does not mean they would necessarily attack the competing branch to the detriment the entire Bitcoin community, their own finances, and to their own reputation and legal standing (not to mention that the vast majority of mining power is still concentrated in pools composed of individual miners). Whichever branch of the fork proves to be more valuable and economically viable will eventually garner miners, as it will be the one more profitable to mine on (regardless of which branch most miners had initially supported).  \n\nWhile it is clearly newsworthy to report on the concerns being put forth by mining organizations, giving the impression that miners could, on their own, reject changes backed by the community as a whole serves only to misinform your readers.': 1, 'I agree with most of what you say, which is why there will be several articles on this issue coming.\n\n(Next up is web-wallets. Tomorrow probably. After that SPV wallets, mining pools, other exchanges, etc.)\n\nHowever, I don\'t really see you point in this case, precicely because this article wasn\'t about miners. It was about exchanges?..\n\nI also disagree that the word "reject" gives the impression that miners could *on their own* reject changes. I mean, yeah, I guess it\'s one way to interpreted it, but not the only way, and it\'s not how I meant it.\n\nI do value feedback though, so thanks for that.': 2, "Of course, but you can't really blame me for what the exchanges tell me.\n\nThis article is technically not about the block size issue, but about what the Chinese exchanges *think* about the block size issue.\n\nDon't shoot the messenger.": 1, "That's a perfectly fair argument, but I'm not really here to argue about the block size limit in itself.\n\nDifferent players within the Bitcoin ecosystem have different opinions on the block size issue.

These exchanges haven\'t just voiced concerns, they have made it pretty clear that they don\'t support this increase.

The subsidy takes care of two of the things you need:\n\n1. Distributing the actual units that you\'re going to transact in a "fair" way (i.e. electricity spent = bitcoin earned). Bitcoins are just the units of account in the Bitcoin ledger, after all.\n\n2. The transactions need to be secure and trustworthy/irreversible.

Another is bribing miners with a transaction fee (so that they\'ll include *your* transactions in their blocks).\n\nObviously, miners generally have an investment in bitcoin, so they won\'t want the network/currency to fail. That only means they\'ll accept less transaction fees, due to seeing the large picture, than they otherwise would.\n\nMining is a complex thing to wrap one\'s head about, which is why most people (including me) need months or years to fully appreciate the subtleties and economics of it.

If you want to assume the same amount of hashrate based security, but paid for by transactions fees instead of block rewards, then you get his number.

To me, it\'s Bitcoin the DAC/DAO that\'s doing the paying, in units that only have value because the receiver thinks they do.

Block rewards + transaction fees basically pay for the hashrate, and hashrate provides a form of security (raises the resource threshold required for an attacker).  Eventually the hashrate will have to be supported by transaction fees, so it is valid to say that "in order to maintain the current hashrate without block rewards, transaction fees would need to be X".  In that sense, yes, that\'s the current "cost" of the network per transaction.\n\nThe question is how useful of a hypothetical that really is, because in reality you don\'t want to subsidize any more hashrate than is "necessary" to keep the network running smoothly, and no one really knows where that point is, and with the way early block rewards work, we haven\'t even really started looking for that point as there\'s been no need.  That\'s going to be the main factor in determining what the "cost" of the bitcoin network ends up being.  Projecting out the current costs which are basically just determined by the value of new bitcoin issuance doesn\'t really say a whole lot as the cost is being driven by demand for bitcoin (price) rather than the need for hashrate, which is what will eventually drive it.\n\nSo while I agree with your observation, I also agree with others that it\'s an observation of pretty limited use for the reasons I explained above.

At the moment, the dollar value of a coinbase transaction is roughly $5,625. (Again, this isn\'t related to the number of transactions in the subsidized block.)\n\n3. Miners will continue to mine as long as it\'s profitable, i.e. their equipment+electricity cost over time is roughly equal to the subsidy. Rational miners, i.e. most of them, will stop mining once it\'s more expensive to mine the bitcoins than it is to buy them directly. (Once more, this isn\'t related to the number of transactions in the subsidized block.)\n\n4. Now, what is the "cost" of creating a block? Over time it will tend towards the point where [marginal revenue equals marginal cost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marginal_cost), right?\n\nStill with me?

It\'s because it\'s NOT actually the cost of processing transactions, but the cost of creating a block, you\'re just confusing the two (which is understandable, but still wrong).\n\nThe "cost" is ONLY derived from the market value and the monetary supply inflation formula.\n\nThe subsidy is fixed (in terms of bitcoins), it doesn\'t change to match the cost of miners.

It still has a long way to go, but it is definitely heading in the right direction but we still have some hurdles. Liquidity and usability are still huge sticking points. We\'ve gotten through the worst, which is that Bitcoin wasn\'t made outright illegal, but banks and government are still going to great lengths to make Bitcoin difficult to acquire and use. Compared to 2 years ago though, Bitcoin has made huge strides in becoming more liquid, there are dozens of reputed exchanges as well as brokers all over the world, not to mention ATMs, local Bitcoins etc. . What\'s more, many of these services are expanding, which is a strong signal that these services will be in a great position to help grow Bitcoin\'s user base. Regulatory certainty is important when big money is involved. Usability is also making huge strides with not one, but *several* hardware wallets, as well as wider use of multisig to help secure transactions. We also see on the wall st side promising signs in the form of the GBTC fund as well as the ETN in Sweden, this tentative news is going to give the Winklevoss ETF more reasons to be approved, rather than be denied. Other Bitcoin institutions are even registering as fully fledged banks, others are becoming regulated enough to have USD deposits insured, etc. etc. .\n\nWhat\'s holding it back could actually be **us**. This constant squabbling over the blocksize, though some see it as a win for decentralised decision making, is IMO, an utter shambles. I for one wanted something to be done about this a year or two ago but now we\'ve left it to the last minute and people are beginning to panic. This uncertainty is BAD. The divisiveness and indecision is damaging to the confidence in the Bitcoin network as a whole and I\'m certain that people are holding back from either using or holding Bitcoin because people can\'t get their shit together and plan Bitcoin\'s scalability into the future. I also think we are still feeling the fallout from the Mt Gox collapse, as well as the news surrounding SR and it\'s operators. They will likely be a pall over Bitcoin for years to come. \n\nThe Bitlicense will draw more businesses to Bitcoin, people need to come to terms with the fact that regulation will happen on the borders of Bitcoin-Fiat and it will limit Bitcoin\'s uses, but it will also make Bitcoin more liquid and usable for people that aren\'t geeks. Whether people like it or not, Mt Gox gave governments ample fuel to justify the need/excuse to intervene and the Bitlicence as well as other legislation in other countries will become the regulatory gatekeepers between Fiat and Bitcoin.  \n\n> what significant event is going to bring out the moonsuits. \n\nIn short, we need assurances that Bitcoin will scale (a scheduled block size increase). Make wallets effortless to use, safe, and secure (this is being worked on with more hardware wallets, as well as better integration of hardware wallets into existing wallet software, as well as better, more widespread usage of multisig wallets). More liquidity (the Bitlicense as well as other countries directly regulating Bitcoin is going to help grease the wheels for more businesses to get involved in Bitcoin). The Winklevoss ETF is probably more a psychological positive than anything else, though it\'s also going to have a strong positive effect on liquidity as it will be able to access wall st money directly, compared to the other funds which are nowhere near as flexible, but passing this will be a huge milestone too for Bitcoin legitimacy, so I expect the approval will give a *very* large boost to the price.\n\nAll of these things are important to creating more demand for Bitcoin, but if I\'d have to peg it on one particular event, I\'d say the ETF approval, as it has undergone literally years of buildup and will open up Bitcoin to a huge pool of potential liquidity, as well as make it effortless for many people to "own" a share of Bitcoin, it will be a huge signal that Bitcoin has passed into mainstream acceptance. Resolving the Bitcoin scaling would also be a huge bullish sign too as it will provide certainty about Bitcoin\'s scaling, and signal that people have finally stopped fighting/bickering over it.\n\nThose aren\'t going to exclusively increase the price though, it, could simply be a slow reversal too as confidence naturally builds up after a period of stability, rather than a single event.\n\n': 21, 'I would say that the ability to short with leverage has made this downtrend especially extended. Years back when bitstamp and mtgox ruled the price, if you wanted to make a profit you had to buy and hold, now you can stomp and supress the price down for profit. Shorting has allowed this downtrend to become a vicious cycle where shorters get money from pushing the price down and once they take profit they short more, big players with short positions sell more to defend their positions, and with all the profit won people just wait for the price to climb to the top of the avarage price and start shorting more, thus never letting an uptrend develop.
