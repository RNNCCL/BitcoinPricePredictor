Klarman argued that short sellers are a useful counterweight to the widespread bullishness on Wall Street,[45] while Buffett believes that short sellers are useful in uncovering fraudulent accounting and other problems at companies.[46]\n\nShortseller James Chanos received widespread publicity when he was an early critic of the accounting practices of Enron.[47] Chanos responds to critics of short-selling by pointing to the critical role they played in identifying problems at Enron, Boston Market and other "financial disasters" over the years.[48] In 2011, research oriented short sellers were widely acknowledged for exposing the China stock frauds.[49]\n\nCommentator Jim Cramer has expressed concern about short selling and started a petition calling for the reintroduction of the uptick rule.[50] Books like Don\'t Blame the Shorts by Robert Sloan and Fubarnomics by Robert E. Wright suggest Cramer exaggerated the costs of short selling and underestimated the benefits, which may include the ex ante identification of asset bubbles.\n\nIndividual short sellers have been subject to criticism and even litigation. Manuel P. Asensio, for example, engaged in a lengthy legal battle with the pharmaceutical manufacturer Hemispherx Biopharma.[51]\n\nSeveral studies of the effectiveness of short selling bans indicate that short selling bans do not contribute to more moderate market dynamics.': 19, 'Apart from the attack of short sellers, there are fundamental reasons why the price of bitcoin has been falling and will continue to fall. Check below.\n\n---------------\n\nBitcoin as a technology is excellent. \n\nAs an investment or store of value there is absolutely no reason to trade at astronomical levels of $400, $300 or $200 and it is more likely that gradually the price will settle in the "tens" of dollars rather than in the "hundreds". The evaporation in the price of bitcoin that we are witnessing in the last months, from over $1,100 to $300, is supported by empirical evidence. \n\nFurthermore, 2 hypotheses support the argument that this evaporation in value is likely to continue. \n\nFirst: the "increasing acceptance argument". As more and more businesses, consumers and regulators come to understand the genious behind bitcoin as a technology and its great advantages as a distributed asset ledger, more and more will be adopting it. However, the increasing acceptance and adoption of bitcoin is inversely related to its price, given that almost NO BUSINESS keeps the bitcoins it receives from its customers and converts them immediately to cash. Hence, day by day, the inrease in supply of bitcoins in the market will push the price down continously with shor increases in price caused mainly by day-traders. \n\nSecond: the "BearWhales argument". There are many early adopters, most of them computers geeks who are not wealthy people or businessmen, usually computer or math guys who were experimenting with digital currencies, who out of the blue became holders of tens of thousands of coins. These people all of a sudden (during 2013 with the phenomenal increase in the price of bitcoin) became millionaires. However, since December 2013 they realised that they are millionaires only "on paper" and unless they cash the coins, their value is going to evaporte. Every now and then BearWhales will make their appearances in the market, like the one we have seen recently, who will dump their coins in thousands in order to cash in before other BearWhales make their move to dump their own coins first. Some of them will realize their coins in a gradual and unnoticeable fashion, as experienced traders do, however in other cases the dumping will be done "in a panic mode", in a similar way than the one we have witnessed recently, where the BearWhale, being in a panic mode, unloaded 30,000 coins at once - no experienced trader sells like that. \n\nSo it is very likely that the price of bitcoin will continue to fall.\n\n\n': -5, 'Without organised defence shorting will likely kill the price.': -10, 'How can they do that?': 2, "Meh, they only affect weak hands.\n\nEventually the short-men will get slaughtered.

Should such an AMA be here in /r/Bitcoin or at /r/IAMA?": 2}, ('Jeremy Heimans: What new power looks like - a good TED talk with a nod to Bitcoin at 10:58 minute mark', 4): {"From /u/Anenome5 in http://www.reddit.com/r/Polycentric_Law/comments/2bkfb2/the_osmotic_strategy_for_change/ although he talks about building cities at sea, most applies directly to bitcoin and decentralised society.\n   \n   \n> The Osmotic strategy holds that most people are essentially apolitical and rely on status-quo bias for their political norms. This means that most people will tend to support the political system they grow up in, live in, and have become accustomed to. Anything outside that norm becomes strange and therefore a threat, to be automatically discounted. We face this every day trying to talk to and convince average people around us whom aren't very interested in politics. We'll never get anywhere with them until we show a working ancap region.\n\n> Thus, the osmotic strategy seeks to harness this phenomenon by establishing an ancap political system and autonomous region using a core of serious ancaps in an enclavist society, such as a seasteading community would provide. We'd need a core of a few hundred ancaps. These need to make a living at sea, but the important thing is that they would help to establish ancap replacement services for governance via a polycentric legal system.\n\n> They would use a private arbitration court to resolve disputes amongst each other, they would purchase private security, and they would buy and trade privately produced law, they would form communities of legal agreement. We need enough ancaps together to require full-time service providers in these areas so we can mature these services in preparation for mass adoption later.\n\n> There are the three required services that all people know they cannot live without and it is the providing of these services that governments tell the people they need government to provide. Governments base their legitimacy entirely on the providing of these services. These are: law production, dispute resolution (courts), and security (police and national defense).\n\n> We will build this ancap society with private replacement services for what the government claims only it can do, and then we will begin growing as a society, meaning adding in the non-political.\n\n> From a couple hundred ancaps we'll hire dozens more at a time, integrate them, get them using voluntarist services, and then dozens more--just import people looking for work who speak English from really just about anywhere in the world. They should be young men and women without a lot of investment in other parts of the world. Early 20's let's say, maybe younger.\n\n> We will expect them to learn and adapt to our system and culture, and they will adapt because it's a new place, a new way of doing things, they will see it working, and it will be all that's on offer. And they'll become accustomed to it.\n\n> In the same way that you don't need a degree in finance to use a bank account, they will not need to know anything about political theory to use these voluntarist services. Yet you will know that if you don't like them, you can always buy from someone else.\n\n> And over time these nonpolitical normals will come to absorb the political norms behind these institutions and propagate them the same way apolitical people propagate the statist systems they're in now.\n\n> Extend this over time and eventually the people in this region who are not ancaps will overshadow the numbers whom are actively ancap, but these regular people will have become ancap by osmosis, through use of the voluntarist services we provide, and experience with a polycentric legal system which gives them far greater control over law than any other system in the world can provide. They will not want to give up this ability. Huge advantage for us.\n\n> And if they end up preferring statist solutions, they're far more likely to just go back to the mainland than try to start a state in a seastead where there's already a much larger ancap majority in place.\n\n> In time we can use this to prove to the world that an ancap society both works and is prosperous, and this will tend to delegitimize statist societies all around the world which have built their legitimacy on the idea that a successful, prosperous society cannot be run without the state, much less an anarchist one.\n\n> We will show them that not only does it work, it works far better and cheaper our way, and we will then begin to brain drain and talent drain the entire world into seasteads, just like the US once did to the world.\nAt that point, our victory over the entire world's statist elements will be virtually certain. Our political norms will be exported round the world, even onto mainlands, without our even trying, because the masses will not want to pay 50+% of their income to governments when they can join an ancap legal system which costs a fraction of that at best, and gives people far more choice and individual empowerment.\n\n> The Osmotic strategy for change, which is inherently an enclavist strategy, is the only realistic strategy for mass change in our lifetime that I know of. It doesn't rely on winning any arguments, or electing anyone, or changing anyone's mind. It's a form of viral agorism which relies on financial incentives and individual choice to prevail over competing systems.\nIt just costs money, time, and effort to build an ancap society, and then test out and mature our voluntarist replacement services of governance without government: police, courts, and law, and then watch the dominoes fall.\nAs governments the world over grow more oppressive, and double-down on their tax burden, they will chase their citizens into our open arms.": 1, 'An interesting talk but Bitcoin barely, barely has any place in it.
