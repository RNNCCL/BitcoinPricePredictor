I assume that there are far more non-mining nodes than mining nodes that contribute a significant amount of hashing power. I also assume that nearly all responsible for maintaining non-mining nodes hold some amount of bitcoin.  \n\nIf my assumptions are true, it's clear that if all miners want one thing, but all those responsible for non-mining nodes want something else, all the miners will be mining on one chain that would likely have almost no bitcoin that would be transacted on it, nor much of a network to receive and transmit new transactions. Meanwhile those that run non-mining nodes but who in aggregate hold a significant amount of bitcoin will wish to transact on another chain. This chain would momentarily be starved for hashing power, perhaps severely restricting it until the next difficulty adjustment (worst-case, a hard fork could be needed here to jump start the network), but new miners would quickly step in as this chain would be where the most value is. *This* is why non-mining nodes (not even just full nodes) have power in the case of a fork.": 1, '> ...if you want to use the client then of course you have to send you coins to it.\n\nBitcoin-XT is essentially the same as Bitcoin-QT, but with a few extra features.

One network would propogate using qt rules, the other would propogate using xt rules. The result would be you would have coins on two different chains, one secured by miners running qt, the other secured by miners running xt.

They identify certain risks associated with the use of those two drugs.  And yes, you can overdose on heroin -- just as you can fatally overdose on alcohol.  [According to the CDC,](http://www.cdc.gov/media/dpk/2015/dpk-vs-alcohol-poisoning.html) "There are more than 2,200 alcohol poisoning deaths in the U.S. each year \xe2\x80\x93 an average of 6 alcohol poisoning deaths every day."  And yes, prolonged heavy use of methamphetamine can cause serious health problems -- just as prolonged heavy use of alcohol can. Again, [according to the CDC](http://www.cdc.gov/alcohol/fact-sheets/alcohol-use.htm), "Excessive alcohol use led to approximately 88,000 deaths and 2.5 million years of potential life lost (YPLL) each year in the United States from 2006 \xe2\x80\x93 2010, shortening the lives of those who died by an average of 30 years. Further, excessive drinking was responsible for 1 in 10 deaths among working-age adults aged 20-64 years."  Specific long-term health problems associated with alcohol abuse include high blood pressure, heart disease, stroke, liver disease, and digestive problems, cancer of the breast, mouth, throat, esophagus, liver, and colon, learning and memory problems, including dementia, mental health problems, including depression and anxiety, etc., etc.\n\nDo those incredibly serious risks mean that alcohol is "terrible"?  More importantly, do they justify the criminal prohibition of alcohol?  No.  We tried that in the 1920s.  And that experience should have taught us that using violence to address what is really a medical and health issue (as well as a matter of personal choice) is a bizarre category error that is not merely ineffective but counterproductive (and barbaric). I believe that prohibition violates an individual\'s fundamental right to exercise sovereignty over his own body and consciousness. Prohibition doesn\'t eliminate the very real problems associated with drug abuse and addiction. It amplifies them while creating a whole slew of new prohibition-related problems, e.g., making the drugs themselves more dangerous by making potency and purity less reliable (see ["bathtub gin"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moonshine#Safety) and the ["iron law of prohibition"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_law_of_prohibition)), empowering and enriching organized crime, fueling black market violence, promoting official corruption, turning millions of ordinary Americans into "criminals," diverting scarce law enforcement resources away from solving real crimes, eroding civil liberties, and driving a huge wedge between police and the communities they\'re supposed to "serve and protect."\n\nAre drugs like meth, heroin, and alcohol "dangerous," i.e. is their use associated with certain risks? Absolutely. Is that a good reason to make a personal decision not to use them? Sure (assuming you conclude that the benefits of use don\'t outweigh the risks). Is it a good reason to violently terrorize people who do choose to use them, presumably after making a different risk-benefit determination?
