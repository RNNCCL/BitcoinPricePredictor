This decision however can\'t be made unilaterally.  Even miners can\'t decide it for us since it\'s a symbiotic system - miners only have a value-creating job if they\'re mining for a network with participants who economically value that network, otherwise what they mine is worthless.  They could fork to a version of bitcoin with infinite rewards, but if the actual users of the network don\'t follow them then their new network is just a bunch of miners and thus useless/worthless.  They can mine all these new "bitcoins" they want, but if the wallets/exchanges/merchants don\'t move to the updated protocol that recognizes them then they won\'t be able to actually do anything with them.\n\nIt may have been a bit unclear from the way I worded it, but I didn\'t mean to say it is certain to be finite; what I was trying to say is that the promise of a completely fixed supply is not dependent on a central authority (who is always tempted by seigniorage) to keep that promise.  It\'s rather dependent on us all (the economic majority, to be more precise) to continue to choose that framework.

That's half the equation (supply) for potentially being the best store of value we've ever had - the other half being demand, which is hard to predict since at root it is a social phenomenon.  But at least on the supply half, it's the first of its kind.
