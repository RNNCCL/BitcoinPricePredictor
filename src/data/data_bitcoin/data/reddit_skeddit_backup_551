': 4, "As a first cut, don't entrust your bitcoin to a questionable exchange (or any exchange unless you've some desire to day trade which is probably a bad idea). Secondly, our report does get into the entirely valid security concerns and how new service providers using better security practices can reduce the risk of theft and fraud: \n>Cryptocurrency is not, however, without its own security risks. The user herself and the user\xe2\x80\x99s own devices and online accounts can be compromised and stored cryptocurrency can be stolen. This possibility creates some new dangers not present in previous payment systems. A credit card company would potentially refund amounts lost by the fraudulent charges of a hacker, but cryptocurrency is like cash in this regard: it will not be easily returned once stolen from a wallet. \n>There are two factors that mitigate this risk of loss. First, the user may choose only to hold and use small amounts of cryptocurrency at any time, much the way a cash user only keeps so many dollars in her wallet, while keeping the bulk of her holdings entrusted to a bank, which can insure her against loss. \n>Secondly, the risk of loss can be mitigated by employing security technologies native to cryptocurrency protocols. One of these technologies is called \xe2\x80\x9cmulti-signature transactions\xe2\x80\x9d or multi-sig for short. Using multi-sig, a cryptocurrency user\xe2\x80\x99s wallet could place funds in a public address that has three controlling keys (hence multiple signatures) to enable transfer. The funds could be locked in that address until two of the three keys are turned. \n>The user could retain two of these keys\xe2\x80\x94one that she stores on her phone and another that she writes on a piece of paper and keeps in a safety deposit box\xe2\x80\x94and the third key can be held by a trusted third party. This could be a loved one, or a private company that specializes in monitoring its customers\xe2\x80\x99 cryptocurrency accounts, ensuring that privately held bitcoins do not get hacked and fraudulently spent. \nWhenever the user\xe2\x80\x99s phone initiates a transaction, the third-party can sign-off so long as it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t look fraudulent. If the phone initiated a transfer of all of the user\xe2\x80\x99s funds out of her wallet to an unknown account, however, this third party could decide to not sign off without some further contact with the user, or some good reason to believe that the phone had not been stolen or the user not manipulated into paying a known scammer. \n>The user, meanwhile, retains a backup key (possibly in a bank safe deposit box), in case the trusted third party ever disappears and stops signing-off on any transactions. At this point, the user could dig up her third key and move funds again, perhaps to a new multi-sig wallet with a better third party watchdog.  \n>This tripartite security can be had without giving any custodial control of funds to the third party. Unlike existing escrow solutions, at no point in the transaction can the fraud protection service make-off with the funds; it has only one of three keys and at least two are required to request a transfer. The worst the service can do is disappear, at which point the user is forced to move her funds using the back-up key in addition to the key on her phone.\n>This solution combines the consumer protection benefits of legacy credit card payment systems the added security of cryptocurrencies. As with credit cards, there is fraud protection apart from user-self help, and transactions are easy to initiate, requiring only the single user credential stored on the phone. Unlike credit cards, however, security is vastly improved because at no point do third parties have access to financial credentials.  Without sufficient keys to effect a transfer, the third parties\xe2\x80\x99 servers never become an attractive target for hackers seeking to steal bitcoins .

Authy is undoubtedly a better user experience and makes life easier for both the company and the users. Of course, as you say, this does have a cost. But some would say the cost is worth it.\n\nOne of the biggest problems with TOTP is that users will inevitably lose their phones or get new ones. If they just use google auth or some other TOTP app, then they need to have saved a copy of their TOTP secret when they set it up (which is potentially dangerous). Some companies allow you to download a set of backup codes ahead of time, anticipating this scenario. You can then use your backup codes to login and change your settings. But implementing all of these things properly and supporting them can be a pain. Especially for a small company with time and budget constraints.\n\nEven then you will still have some users who lose their backups and their codes. So you need to have some manual process to allow customer service to reset a user's 2FA through manual verification.

It's my understanding that faking seeding and hash would be next to impossible.": 3, 'I think that there are two aspects to a truly fair system. First, the operator must get the cryptography right. I think this is the case for most bitcoin casinos at this point.\n\nThe second point is that it must be as easy as possible to verify a bet. If you have to copy and past strings into a web form, most users will not verify a lot of bets. This opens the door for operators to cheat sometimes, even if they can claim to be "provably fair".\n\nOn the other hand one must keep in mind that a bitcoin casino operator that is caught cheating, even just once, is basically out of business. So I think the incentives are for operators to act fairly. ': 3, 'Also client side seeds': 1, "The ELI5 is yes, it's fair, if you check the proof.": 2, 'If anyone\'s interested, here is a more in-depth article I wrote about provably fair betting systems: [What does "provably fair" mean?](https://thebitcoinstrip.com/blog/what-does-provably-fair-mean.html)': 3, 'good ELI5': 6, 'ELI16\n\nThat would not be provably fair as the site provided the hash and therefor the site decided what would be dealt. To avoid this the site lets the user provide a seed which modifies the hash and therefore the deal. After the deal the site shows the user \n\nthe original hash   \nwhat would have been the original deal  \nthe seed that modified the hash   \nthe final deal \n\nAnd the user can verify that the original deal was modified in accordance with the seed the user provided that the site could not have predicted. Therefore the site could not have decided the deal or known what would be dealt.\n\nELI7\n\nThis page explains it well in text and video. \n\nImportant: a provably fair operator can still rip you off in other ways\n\nInteresting: This is all independent of bitcoin, a government currency site could implement it just as easily\n\nhttp://bitcoin-casino-guide.com/provably-fair-gambling/\n\n': 2, 'Here is my explanation. The basic idea is that the casino and the player determine jointly what the outcome of a bet will be. As both parties can influence who wins, neither can cheat.\n\nTo accomplish this, both the casino (called server below) and the player (client) choose a secret string, called server secret and client secret. They also agree on an algorithm that computes the winner from the these two strings. For example, one could use the last bit of the hash of the concatenation of strings as such an algorithm.\n\nIt gets a bit more involved if you start to think about how the secrets are exchanged. A simplistic protocol would be that \n\n* client and server pick their secrets, \n* the client then send his secret to the server, \n* the server performs the hash and notifies the client about the outcome of the bet. \n\nThe problem with this protocol is that if the server concludes that the player has won, she could simply change her secret into one that results in a loss for the client (she could just generate random server secrets until she finds one that results in a loss).\n\nThis problem can easily be solved with what cryptographers call a "commitment scheme". This is a scheme where the server commits to her secret before she sees the client secret. This proves to the client that she did not change her secrets after the fact. One way to do this is to publish the hash her secret before the client sends his secret. This is sufficient bc given hash(server_secret) it is computationally impossible to find another string fake_server_secret such that hash(server_secret)=hash(fake_server_secret). This makes it impossible for the server to change her secret after seeing the client secret. Thus, if we add the following as the second step of the protocol above, the casino cannot cheat anymore:\n\n* The server sends hash(server_secret) the to client \n\nIf implemented correctly, a provably fair system is a strong cryptographic proof that the casino is acting fairly. In my mind this is a far greater player protection than the protection that is offered by a licensing regime. I have written a more in depth explanation of provably fairness here: https://fastslots.co/fairness': 3, "I wrote a program to play one of these sites over a period of time in order to confirm to myself that the hash provided was consistently valid.

After you\'ve bet, they tell you if you\'ve won or lost.\n\nIf you want to prove they didn\'t cheat you, you can get them to show you that text -  "at 7.52 am, we rolled a 5 for user dogglegangme".  And you can check that the hash value of this is indeed 398284982984.\n\nThis is a very stripped down example - the dice sites tend to combine various seeds and actually use the hashing procedure to generate the random numbers.  But this shows the principle :)': 13, "It can be fudged if you can't reliably get a piece of information before / during the bet (the latter being mainly for txids, which is out of the site's control) that you can validate and use to reproduce the result at some point afterwards.
