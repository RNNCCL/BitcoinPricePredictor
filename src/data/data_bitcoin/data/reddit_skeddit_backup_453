The software will never sign a transaction unless your coins are going to exactly the right address in the right amount.\n\nOther mixing services mix your coins with other users, resulting in you getting back coins possibly related to drugs, stolen money or other illegal or immoral practices. This is highly undesirable if you just don\'t want your employer knowing which non-profits you support from your salary. Because of the incentives of JoinMarket, you have access to a huge amount of clean, untainted bitcoins to mix with at a very low price. Many of the bitcoins you\'re mixing with will be bought from regulated exchanges, owned by legitimate holders of bitcoin.\n\nNot to mention you\'d likely be paying lower fees for mixing than other services, because of the competition between willing-to-wait coinjoiners. Indeed if you don\'t mind waiting, you can wait around with a low offer fee and maybe another impatient coinjoiner will join with you.\n\nIt\'s easy to see why people are using JoinMarket, it is already being used for real life privacy. Here\'s an example of a coinjoin noticed recently on the blockchain, it is for 0.87btc or ~$200 https://blockchain.info/tx/7d588d52d1cece7a18d663c977d6143016b5b326404bbf286bc024d5d54fcecb': 8, "Currently joinmarket is running on mainnet, but it's early days; e.g. yesterday people were worried that they'd lost coins because of small bug in the wallet display script (of course, they hadn't).\n\nI mention it to illustrate the point that there's still a fair amount of ground to cover, even though it *is* true that you can start running it now on real joins (and indeed we are having txs going through, mostly small of course).\n\nSo if you want to run it and take part you'll need to be patient in set up. I doubt it's very practical to run on anything but Linux, although OSX might be fine (any reports?).

(Most "money" in bank accounts is actually just credit, not money, and actual money was made out of paper.) But since we are living in the information age, a method for transferring money using information was nevertheless required, and the simplest solution was just the IOU. That is to say, I could call you up and tell you, "I promise I will pay you within 3 business days X amount." If the money, not being digital, required time to send, at least the promise to pay that money could be communicated instantly. \n\nOf course, promise to pay is not the same thing as payment itself, so a sophisticated set of institutions was required to make sure most promises were reliable and kept (and thus the credit card was born). So promise to pay effectively became a substitute for money in a world where everything was digital but the money was not. With Bitcoin, however, we now have digital money. \n\n(In many respects, the problem with the modern financial system is that everything revolves around the settlement of promises to pay. Like a house of cards, if one set of promises to pay is not met, all the rest can come crashing down, a chain reaction that could bring down national economies, as we saw in 2008. Imagine a system, however, where promises to pay didn\'t involve risk or interest, but rather were automatically settled by the system (in a way similar to what we see with Bitshares).

And it wasnt downvoted enough ': 1, 'OP\'s article references another story [here](http://www.businessinsider.com/hsbcs-stephen-king-on-the-world-economy-2015-5?google_editors_picks=true) in which an HSBC economist says that he fears that central banks lack the proper tools to fight a new recession, when it happens. Said economist is spouting a version of the problem of the zero lower bound (ZLB), the point at which central banks can\'t lower interest rates any further. Interest rates are the primary tool of modern central banks, and so pre-2008, a lot of economic thought and research went into wondering what a interest rate-wielding central bank would do, should interest rates approach or hit zero percent.\n\nI don\'t understand why he\'s hung up on that, because since 2008, multiple central banks have done things at the ZLB which have had a remarkable impact. QE was justified on ZLB grounds, and other central bank actions (variants of operation twist, which effectively refinanced US debts; bank guarantees; negative interest rates; and much more) have all shown that, at the ZLB, central banks can still do plenty of stuff. \n\nSo, what the HSBC economist was saying is "If a new recession is coming, I don\'t know what CB\'s will do!" and is apparently (miraculously) ignorant of everything the CB\'s have been doing since 2008. Inflationary risks around the world are very low, so there is no reason to think that CB\'s don\'t still have enough economic space to launch a new QE, or buy bad debts from private enterprises, or do anything else that they\'ve done since 2008.\n\nShould a new recession hit tomorrow, CB\'s will do what they have been doing - find creative ways to print money.': 8, 'All agreed. \n\nBut here\'s the thing that I sense you (and likely article author P.

Keep calm and just replace upper case characters by good explanations, that would be fully sufficient for a pragmatic discussion.\n\nWhat you are describing is that all market participants using the currency of the central bank XYZ use electronic bank accounts directly controlled and maintained by that central bank (instead of private banks), so the central bank itself has a full record of all transactions between any two entities. This is what I understood so far, am I right?\n\nThen, which *database format* the central bank uses *internally* for this, its own, central ledger, is completely unimportant. Then my question is: Why would you call *this* a BLOCKCHAIN? This does not fit my definition of a blockchain. This simply fits my definition of a traditional *central* ledger or record of transactions. Since it is centrally controlled by the central bank XYZ itself, it does not need to "secure" its own ledger by something like "mining" of blocks or a proof of work algorithm. This is something you only need in a *de*centralized ledger, like Bitcoin, but you never need this for a centralized ledger, it would just be a waste of cost without any additional added value.\n\nIn other words: The central bank would be stupid to use the "blockchain" database format as the file format for its own central ledger, because it only had extra cost without any additional value whatsoever.\n\nThat\'s why - to come back to the original point - why a central bank\'s "alt-coin", as long as it is centrally maintained, has nothing to do with bitcoin-like currencies, but is instead much more similar to today\'s centralized money system (incl. features like that accounts can be frozen, money can be confiscated etc.), except that it would be even easier than today to do all this.\n\nSo, if I draw a straight line from left to right and let it denote the degree of freedom and decentralization and independence that a currency has, then Bitcoin would be located to the far right of the current fiat money, whereas the new central bank money you are outlining is located on the opposite side, even much further to the left, relative to today\'s fiat money.\n\nSo that central money you are outlining is even less similar to Bitcoin than today\'s fiat money is, so it is completely misplaced in this discussion of alt-coins (unless we call every currency, incl. EUR and USD, an alt-coin, but then we can equally well talk about "currency" instead of "alt-coin").\n\nTo be clear: My (and supposedly most people\'s) definition of "alt-coin" is that it must be characterised by a decentralized ledger (whether it is a blockchain or something similar) that is not controlled by a central authority. Neither current fiat nor your central bank money fits this definition even slightly, so it is a failure to bring this into the discussion about alt-coins.': 1, 'you misunderstood Bitcoin!
