I don\'t believe in having a block limit calculated automatically based on past blocks. Because it really doesn\'t put a limit at all. Suppose I wanted to spam the network. Now there is a limit of 1MB/block so I create 1MB/block of junk. If I keep this up the rule will update the size to 2MB/block, and then I spam with 2MB/block. Then 4MB, ad infinitum. The effects of increasing demand for legitimate transaction is similar. There\'s no real limit and no real market for fees.\n\n b. I\'ll clarify again my goal here is not to solve the problem of what the optimal block limit is - that\'s a separate problem. I want to prevent a scenario where a wrong block limit creates catastrophic failure. With a soft cap, any parameter choice creates a range of legitimate block sizes.\n\nYou could set now T = 3MB, and if in the future we see that tx fees are too high and there are enough blocks, increase it.\n\n (2). I have described one causal path. Of course SPV is a stronger causal path but it\'s also completely irrelevant, because SPV clients are already here and we don\'t want them to go away. They are a given. Block size, however, is something we can influence; and the primary drawback of bigger blocks is, as I described, the smaller number of nodes.\n\nYou can argue that the effect is insignificant - but it is still the case that\nMany people currently do believe the effect is significant, and\nThis argument will be easier to discuss once we don\'t have to worry about crash landing.\n\n (3). Thanks, I\'ll try to examine Greg\'s proposal in more detail.\n\n**My reply**\n\nWho are "you" ?\n\nAre you a miner or an end-user?\n\nIf you are a miner, then you can produce maximum-sized blocks and influence the average size based on your share of hash rate. But miners who want to keep blocks small have equal influence.\n\nIf you are an end-user, how do you afford transaction fees to spam the network?\n\n----------------------\n\nIf you are arguing that transaction fees may not give miners enough reward to secure the network in the future, I wrote about that here:\n   http://gavinandresen.ninja/block-size-and-miner-fees-again\nand here:\n   https://blog.bitcoinfoundation.org/blocksize-economics/\n\nAnd re: "there is no real limit and no real market for fees" :  see\n  http://gavinandresen.ninja/the-myth-of-not-full-blocks\n\nThere IS a market for fees, even now, because there is demand for "I want my transaction to confirm in the next block or three."\n\n': 42, 'I agree with this sentiment.

With respect to (c): Though I was aware of and had implemented hashcash the idea of applying it to consensus had not occurred to me then.\n\nMy argument back then was not so formal; -- the context was that people were arguing against the creation of the whats now called the Wikimedia Foundation (the non-profit that supports Wikipedia), suggesting instead that Wikipedia should just be made into a completely decentralized system with no authority having any method of influencing. While I agreed with the spirit, I argued that while people could have their own repositories without issue, Wikipedia as a singular "thing" with a universally agreed current version and history could not exist with complete decentralization (due to a longer version of the argument I\'ll explain below).  (And, since there was going to be _some_ centralization we better darn well get it right, and get the most value out of it that we can).\n\nThere simplified intuitive proof: I had a definition of decenteralized as we\'d use for Bitcoin today, which precludes the known-participant model used in classical consensus system.  Instead I assumed a system with no admissions: a truly decentralized one where anyone can come and go at any time without anyone\'s approval; which is intuitively what we wanted then. Assume there are some participants in this system and they somehow come to a consensus about a particular state of the system.  Later, from their perspective, communication shows up from a majority of users they didn\'t previously know about and _couldn\'t_ have known about because they were previously outside of the \'new\' participants [light cone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_cone).  Now what?  At some distance in space you are potentially causally disconnected, and in that state all the participants can come to mutually exclusive false consensus.  The time you have to wait for consensus to be sure of not being surprised by a far away majority is forever.  (It also turns out that Lamport had written about this  general subject in the 70s, though I wasn\'t aware of it at the time.)\n\nOf course this is a bit of a flight of fancy, as we don\'t (yet) normally compute across distances where the speed of light is _that_ significant relative to human concerns... but unreliable and disconnected networks do not look so dissimilar from participants who are relativisticly disconnected. Worse, even ignoring these problems how can you prevent sibyl attacks without using identity that compromises the requirement of decentralization? --- heck, what does a "consensus" even really mean without a definition of identity?   I argued instead that you had to at least have admissions which were defined externally to the system (defining it internally has a circularity problem)-- some kind of persistent issued identity--, which solves both problems (and then lets you use classical consensus tools), but makes impossible a strong definition of decentralized.\n\nBitcoin answers these problems with both a relaxed definition of "consensus"-- one that becomes more confident over time but which is never completely sure-- and the use of a hashcash-comittment lottery which is a relaxed definition of "participant". The hashcash lottery is not obvious for many reasons, including: why would enough computation ever been spent on it to make it secure (Bitcoin\'s answer is economic incentives-- you get fees and newly created coins.). Actually because of the way the lottery works Bitcoin does even better (the work is cumulative and the system makes progress) and is more subtle that that, but those are the main distinctions.\n\nWith these assumptions the system can work within some radius (which has to be a tiny fraction of the inter-block time), and maybe even be secure :) ... though it navigates a very narrow line around systems which are more clearly not secure (in particular, the incentives appear fairly fragile and the large mining bounty incentivizes various kinds of centralization).\n\nAh... There is a special kind of ignorance that comes from convincing yourself of something. Had I just read a similar argument I probably wouldn\'t have trusted it so much. :) Thought once I actually read the Bitcoin whitepaper and source, I immediately saw understood why my belief was not applicable. The kind of "decenteralized consensus" I was working in terms of was impossible, but other kinds dodge that result and can be useful-- even if not for the original application I was thinking in terms of (which still would likely fail to be usefully secure on the incentive grounds).  Care must always be taken when generalizing, and it\'s important to remember that no two different things are the same-- even when we call them the same name; especially when what counts depends so tremendously on the details.\n\n[Ah, and since no one else said it:  Welcome to Reddit "blocksize"!]': 19, 'Bitcoin is something almost alien in nature in a way.

If someone arranges it so that two people on opposite sides of the globe send two conflicting transactions at exactly the same time, it really is impossible for network participants to know which one came objectively first, but "consensus" means that the network needs to have some single final answer. Bitcoin\'s solution is weak in that the network can spend time (theoretically even years) split in two or more pieces, and when it finally does merge into one network again, the final answer might not be correct by *any* criteria.
