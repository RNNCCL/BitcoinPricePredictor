What\'s your source?\n\n> A much bigger group is those who think that not everyone needs to have the ability to run a node.\n\nI don\'t think Satoshi would necessarily be in that group. I think ultimately having internet cash for every coffee in the world and running a node at home are mutually exclusive. LN *might* solve that -- with compromises. But even with LN we\'ll need much bigger blocks if we want to run a payment network for 7 billion people.\n\n> I\'m pretty sure everyone wants the same thing: Decentralized which makes it trust-less and therefore able to be some sort of "Internet cash" -Bitcoin.\n\nI think this is true. The conspiracy theories are utter bullshit. Core aims to build the most elegant solution, Gavin & co are a bit more pragmatic. I can sympathize with both sides.\n\nThere are however a lot more idiots in the big block camp (but that doesn\'t invalidate the approach).': 2, "It's a myth that increasing max block size makes it harder to run a full node, in fact the opposite is true.  Let's examine in detail.  There are 4 resources that full nodes require - hard disk, CPU, RAM and bandwidth.\n\n**Hard disk**:  Increasing max block size could increase the rate at which hard disks fill up with the blockchain.  Pruning isn't really a large scale solution - can't have all nodes be pruned (or can we?)  Hard disk space is extremely cheap though and cost is decreasing every year - a $100 4TB hard drive today could store full 10MB blocks for 7.6 years.  Hard disk is not a limiting resource for nodes.\n\n**CPU**:  Initial block chain verification takes a lot of CPU resources, but very little to continue operating.  Check points in the blockchain have been utilized already to decrease the amount of initial verification that needs to be done.  Additionally libsecp256k1 has been reported to decrease validation time by 7 fold.  Today's processors are more than capable of handling larger blocks, as tests while forking bitcoin testnet to 8MB max blocks have shown, as well as achieving 40tx/s on the dogecoin testnet.  CPU is not a limiting resource for nodes.\n\n**RAM**:  During the spam attacks in late 2015 we saw about 10% of nodes get knocked out due to mempool backlog exponentially increasing required RAM.  RAM is a limiting resource.  Increasing the max block size will decrease the amount of RAM required by making mempool backlog events more rare and increasing the cost for a spammer to fill up blocks.  As a response to the spam attacks knocking out nodes with not enough RAM, the devs implemented mempool dropping of transactions - mempool management is now largely in the hands of users.  This solves the problem of nodes without enough RAM getting knocked out by backlogs, however comes with a tradoff, it introduces another problem:\n\n**Bandwidth**:  Probably the most limiting resource for node operators.  Users with bandwidth caps are already not able to run a full node economically (fortunately very little of the developed world has bandwidth caps - Australia, the US and China being notable exceptions).  Increasing the max block size may seem on the surface to increase bandwidth requirements, but let's think about it deeper.  First there's block transmission.  Technologies available today such as thin blocks decrease the amount of bandwidth required for block propagation to close to 0, and other technologies in development (IBLTs) could do even better.  So block propagation bandwidth is a solved problem.  \n\nTransaction relaying is what's left.  If we are frequently hitting the max block size limit, then those mempools fill up fast.  Nodes will be dropping those transactions.  Since mempool management is left up to the user, nodes will lose their mempool synchronization.  Now our thin block relay improvements are lessened.  Nodes that still have the transactions will periodically rebroadcast it to nodes that don't, resulting in redundant bandwidth.  A spam attacker gets to use bandwidth of the network for relaying their transactions that are ultimately dropped from mempools and therefore not mined, therefore no fee is paid for this bandwidth usage.  Further, legitimate transactions will be getting dropped too.  These will have to be resent by the sender (perhaps with RBF), resulting in more redundant bandwidth usage.  \n\nSo ironically, keeping the max block size low causes increased bandwidth usage of nodes in adversarial conditions (blocks being full either through spam or legit use) due to spammers not having to pay for the bandwidth they use from mempool dropping, or legit transactions getting redundantly rebroadcasted either by the sender or by nodes that didn't drop them to nodes that did.\n\n**Conclusion**:  Increasing the max block size increases hard disk and CPU requirements, however these are not limiting resources for nodes.  Keeping max block size small and encountering backlogs more frequently requires more RAM and it requires more bandwidth - either from spammers or from legitimate usage - which are the two limiting resources to run a full node.": -4, "> I think nobody said that the Bitcoin network will fail...\n\nThe Crash Landing post makes this falsifiable claim - as transaction volume overflows block capacity, nodes will fail, setting up a vicious cycle:\n\n>Bitcoin Core has no code in it to handle a permanent and growing transaction backlog. Transactions just queue up in memory until the node runs out. At that point one of three things can happen:\n>\n> 1. The node might become incredibly slow as it enters swap hell.\n> 2. The node might crash when it tries to allocate memory and fails.\n> 3. The node might be killed by the operating system kernel.\n>\n> ...\n>\n>  ... So as the backlog grows, nodes will start running out of memory and dying. And it will take time until they get restarted.\n>\n> ...\n>\n> I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how fast this situation would play out, but as Core will accept any transaction that\xe2\x80\x99s valid without any limit a node crash is eventually inevitable.\n\nAlthough this did appear to happen in isolated cases, those were the exceptions rather than the rule. Electrum servers seemed to be especially vulnerable to high memory pool use for some reason. But that's something for the Electrum team to fix.\n\n> ... , but that full blocks will hinder adoption and drive people and businesses away.\n\nThat's a valid hypothesis, but I'm not sure it's testable. AFAIK, there is no way to determine the number of active Bitcoin users.\n\nMerchant adoption does appear to be slowing, as evidenced by problems at BitPay and postings to /r/bitcoin. But that can also be explained by the practical difficulty of buying, selling, and holding onto bitcoin, not to mention a slowdown in the mass media hype cycle, serious unaddressed problems that merchants face running two different revenue streams, and generally low use after the adoption announcement is made. All of these problems predate the block size controversy.\n\n\n\n": 7, '> The chinese miners have been convinced (read:coerced) by Core\n\nOf course they have sweetheart. Big bad core!

It worked exactly as designed, the attackers lost money, and wallet developers are waking up to the idea that fixed fees are a bug, not a feature.\n\nDespite repeated claims that raising the block size limit was the Will of the Users, no hard fork update has been deployed.\n\nMaking a case for change and vigorously pushing for it are both commendable.\n\nBut failing to face facts that refute your original hypothesis can only be self-destructive to yourself and those who trusted you.

But if you make that number higher, spammers can then just move up to your new threshold.  When mempools are dropping all the lowest fee transactions, spammers only need to make their transactions the lowest fee ones to not have to pay for the bandwidth they are using since their transactions will be dropped.\n\nDoubling the amount of transactions every 10 minutes does increase bandwidth requirements.  The question is, is bandwidth increased more if we have the extra blockspace to accommodate them or more if we don't?  Let's say we have 4000 transactions per 10min, and they are each 500 bytes, meaning they could fill up 2MB blocks.\n\nWith 2MB max block size, blocks are full, bandwidth requirements are double what they would be if we had 2000 transactions per 10min and 1MB blocks.\n\nWith 1MB max block size, 2000 transactions are incorporated into the block and 2000 sit in the mempool waiting for the next block.  Next 10 minute period, now we have 4000 new transactions and 2000 old ones.  2000 are incorated.  Next 10min, 4000 new transactions and 4000 old ones, 2000 are incorporated.  Next 10min, 4000 new transactions and 6000 old ones, 2000 are incorporated.  Next 10min... and so on. \n\nNow our mempools have 10,000 transactions backlogged in less than an hour.  Soon they will have to start dropping transactions.  Lowest fee ones prioritized for dropping.  If this is a spammer, now he's started using network bandwidth for free, his transactions will not be mined because they are dropped.  If these are real transactions, then the sender will be annoyed the transaction didn't go through and will have to start resending with a higher fee.  Now we are relaying the same transaction twice, redundantly.\n\nIt just continues to get worse from there.  When we have more transactions than the network can handle, attacker/spammers get to use your bandwidth for free, real people have to rebroadcast their transactions.  It gets exponentially worse.  After a day of 4000 transactions per 10min period, we now have over 250,000 transactions that have been dropped.  Many of them needing to be sent and resent multiple times.\n\nThe ever increasing backlog scenario would be completely catastrophic to node operators, bandwidth would not just double as in the case where we have big enough block space to accomadate 4000tx/block, it would increase exponentially for the duration of the attack.  As long as attacker/spammers keep their fees high enough to be relayed, but low enough to be dropped, they essentially get to use as much bandwidth of the network as they want for free.\n\nWhat would happen then is fees would skyrocket well past the point of anyone actually being able to use bitcoin.  Some of the spammer's transactions would start confirming now that nobody is actually using bitcoin anymore and the spammer would stop to save money.  Fees would return to normal.  Then the spammer could start the chaos all over again.\n\nIf these 4000 transactions per 10min were real people trying to use bitcoin and not a spammer, well then fees would increase to the point where only half of the people who want to use bitcoin can use it.  And the other half just can't, so they go use dogecoin instead since it has much lower fees and 10X the block space as bitcoin.": 3, 'If they have its because of FUD not because of reality of the network.

However they\'re happily kicking out all the people who\'re developing the long term solutions. There\'s **lots** of fuss - the system is *very* complex. So it\'s **very** easy to be confused which gives an opportunity for some, the annoying group, to game your opinion.\n\nThis small group is just small. They use Bitcoins complexity - that most people don\'t really *know* how it works - as an edge to steer opinions. They understate the objective importance of decentralization. They lie. They are populist. Many of them don\'t even know they\'re doing all this.\n\nBut they\'re just minority. A much bigger group is those who think that not everyone needs to have the ability to run a node. In reality, majority of Bitcoin users do not run a node. The point is that "everybody" should have the ability to run a full-verifying node at some sane cost, at their homes.\n\nWhat means "running a node"? Being 100% equal to others in the network. This is the *only* way to use Bitcoin in a trust-less, secure way. Many do not value this, and so they don\'t think this is important. But it is very important *system-wise.* Many consider SPV-usage or connecting to several full nodes as "safe enough". That sounds like safe enough, indeed. But what if everyone, or majority did this? The more SPV usage in the network the less secure it gets.\n\nSo increasing the block sizes cause centralization because the requirements to run a full node increase, and some people can\'t run a node after increased requirements. We also know that block sizes can\'t be increased very much. 20MB is absolutely centralizing. Even 5MB is too much, according to some analysis.\n\nSo why is this block size increasing so damn important for Gavin? And why it was so important for Hearn? Why is this so important for so many? Could it be that there\'s quite a nice amount of misinformation and the issue has been weighted way too much? People also need to learn the importance and definition of decentralization as the non-knowledge about it has been used as a weapon for last year.\n\nWe know that increasing block sizes is not a solution.

Bitcoin could offer a way to side-step any kind of capital controls put in place on money transferred abroad, and those capital controls would push people to use Bitcoin.\n\nSo ostensibly that all sounds good for Bitcoin, by giving people a damn good reason to adopt it. However if enough people started going to Bitcoin to transfer money, or a large enough amount of money started to be transferred with it, don\'t you think he\'d start to try and impose some kind of controls on it too? Either through things like egregiously complicated and restricting regulations, or an outright ban on its use? Trump\'s done a pretty good job getting his supporters whipped up into a frenzy over his demonization of certain demographic groups and individuals, I doubt he\'d have a problem getting some people to buy into Bitcoin primarily being a tool used by criminals. So it would simultaneously cast a pall over both Bitcoin, and those who use Bitcoin.\n\nAnd don\'t forget that this is the candidate that wanted to "shut down" parts of the Internet. I wouldn\'t be surprised if he started to call for making attempts at shutting down access to the Bitcoin network. Now, granted, there would most likely be some ways to circumvent that, but a government ban would definitely scare off a lot of people and have an impact on wide-spread adoption.\n\nNow, regardless of the feasibility of all that, having a guy with that kind of mindset in the White House likely would not be good for Bitcoin, at least in the short-term, but likely leaving a longer term stain on its reputation in the general public. The best thing for Bitcoin would more likely be a candidate that is against censorship of the Internet, and one who doesn\'t want to impose a lot of capital controls.

That\'s clearly as strong of a statement as saying "Polar bears don\'t eat sheep"... I mean, yes it\'s factually true because there are no sheep in the Arctic but we all know it won\'t end well for sheep if polar bears adapt to warmer weather.\n\n\nSending funds internationally with a common impartial unit of value is clearly the ideal solution people would design if history didn\'t play a role... right now, bitcoin is the only serious contender for an online global unit of value that matches the ideal money criteria (instantly transferable, supply limited, not controlled by any country or individual, divisible, fungible, etc..)  .  It may not happen in the next decade but I\'m confident it will happen.\n\n\nThose saying it won\'t be bitcoin based are inadvertently asking for something vastly more disruptive to happen... if bitcoin experiment were to fail it\'s only because something even more aggressive disrupts the financial world at an even faster rate.\n\n\nPretending the banks will not be effected is overlooking the obvious... this is merely a natural evolution of money now we use the internet.
