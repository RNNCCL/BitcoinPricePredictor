You agree Corporations will do all the mining, so if you assume Corporations run all the nodes - that\'s a MAJOR issue.\n\nGavin Andresen is on the record in his latest blogpost agreeing with Patrick Strateman\'s numbers. Do you deny this?\n\nGavin has AGREED nobody new will be able to sync the full Bitcoin blockchain if BIP101 goes into effect and technology doesn\'t improve by 20% YoY.\n\nSir, I kindly submit to you that CORPORATIONS will run ALL the nodes in that case, because it would take a superhuman effort to keep your individual node operating for 20 years straight without ever turning it off due to computer failure or internet connectivity issues. No, the only way you can run a node in that case is in a DATACENTER controlled by a CORPORATION, and the only "organizations" as you put it, able to do that are CORPORATIONS. Oh, I\'m sorry, and The Smithsonian Institute can also run a node.\n\nIf Corporations run all the nodes, you will NEVER be able to bid for inclusion into a decentralized ledger because Bitcoin\'s "distributed" Ledger WILL CEASE TO EXIST. As I\'ve put to you countless times before, if Intel and TSMC do all the mining while Google and Apple run all the nodes - how is that ANY different than a permissioned ledger where ONE Corporation runs all the nodes and the miners instead of four megacorps?  Why would you even want to own permissioned ledger coins? That\'s an extreme example on purpose, because far too many of you XTers seem to have forgotten Bitcoin LOSES ALL PURPOSE without its decentralization. Without decentralization, Bitcoin is a *permissioned ledger* which you\'ve just agreed is *garbage* that you would never want to own.\n\n> a substitute for the classical blockchain\n\nAs I just said, your classical blockchain isn\'t going to be so classical anymore if Corporations run all the nodes in datacenters controlled by other Corporations.\n\nAnd in no way would I recommend putting ALL of your savings onto LN or voting pools. **You don\'t have to** put 100% of your bitcoins in to get the benefit, especially since most people NEVER SPEND THEIR BITCOINS. Just like you don\'t put ALL your bitcoins onto paper wallets, you don\'t put ALL your bitcoins onto LN or voting pools. Risk 1% of your wealth, not 100%.\n\nWhether it\'s a voting pool or LN, I don\'t expect anyone to put all their money there. You should be able to use either technology with a reasonably low percentge of your total bitcoins even if the on blockchain fee was $20. Keeping the bitcoin protocol decentralized is infinitely more important because without that your BTC and your "classical blockchain" is toast.': 2, 'Please provide a source.': 1, 'None of what you said is true. Parties other than corporations will be able to run full nodes if blocks get large. You\'re claiming it\'ll be only "Corporations" because the word pushes emotional buttons. In reality, a large enough Bitcoin co-op, educational institution, or any other organisation with sufficient resources, could run a full node with super large blocks.\n\nFurthermore, under BIP 101, which is the most aggressive proposal on the table right now, blocks don\'t get super large. Many individuals will be able to run full nodes, because the block size limit will start at 8 MB, and be capped at 8 GB by 2035. Personal computers with consumer grade internet can handle 8 GB of bandwidth in some places in the world right now. This will be true in many more places by 2035. Your fearmongering about "only Corporations being able to run full nodes in data centers owned by other Corporations" is simply dishonest.': 1, 'Apparently that does not make money.': 2, 'It\'s great to see industry veterans voicing support for Back\'s 2-4-8 plan.\n\nBut I do have a quip with Stephen\'s logic here:\n\n> \xe2\x80\x9cAt the same time, a block size that is too small would result in fewer people being able to afford transactions. If only a few people use bitcoin for transactions, those people will eventually realize that they could conduct those transactions much more cheaply by compromising on decentralization.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nWhile it\'s true that only a few people would be able to afford **on-blockchain** transactions if fees are extremely high, LN and voting pools provide a fair middle ground where daily consumerist BTC transactions can still occur at super low fees, instantly and without sacrificing censorship resistance.\n\nAnd I follow Pair\'s line of thinking here - if only 5 megabanks can afford to settle **on the blockchain** why wouldn\'t they adopt a permissioned ledger? But the logic is trivially falsifiable by looking at US Dollars for one.\n\nMost notably, US Dollar ISSUANCE is **inflationary** and controlled by a tiny elite that denies entrance to any would be competitors.\n\nConversely, even at a $20 on-blockchain transaction fee, your entrance fee is global and highly accessible at that cost level. Furthermore, with blockchain resource usage minimized, anyone can run a full node and open ancillary Bitcoin services easily at minimum possible cost.\n\nMeanwhile, holding US Dollars as an end user isn\'t safe due to widely abused civil asset forfeiture laws and the risk of political intervention. The chances of an individual gaining priviledged access to core banking functions is slim to none.\n\nBTC held in cold storage stands immune to inflation over the long term, and is continuously protected from civil asset forfeiture and political intervention.\n\nSo no matter HOW expensive it is to transact ON THE BLOCKCHAIN, holding BTC in cold storage STILL retains advantages over the incumbent fiat system.\n\nNow, BTC held at Coinbase is at the opposite extreme of BTC held in cold storage. You get all the downsides of fiat currency, and all the downsides of depending on a distributed ledger save the anti-inflation protections which are, laughably, still held intact making Coinbase a net win for the end user over US Dollars held at a bank.\n\nBut critically, this all assumes the Bitcoin protocol itself isn\'t coopted by megabanks which under aggressively misguided growth assumptions would become the only Corporations able to afford running the nodes in datacenters owned by other Corporations while still other megacorps perform all the hashing - a terribly insidious outcome. With Corporations running all the nodes and Corporations running all the mining, depending on how few Corporations and how readily identifiable their executives are, this puts Bitcoin\'s key civil asset forfeiture protections, inflation-proof protections and political protections at risk. Suddenly there\'s not much point in owning Bitcoin at ALL, even if on-blockchain transaction fees were $0 - so what? It\'s $0 to make an "on-blockchain" transaction on a permissioned ledger.': 3, 'I stopped trolling on their ridiculous subreddit.

They\'re no different in terms of centralization than Blockstream\'s federated sidechains, which everyone, including them, acknowledges are not decentralized, and not meant to be a substitute for the classical blockchain. Sure you have more than one signer, but they are all trusted, and number of signers is limited to 15.\n\n>But critically, this all assumes the Bitcoin protocol itself isn\'t coopted by megabanks which under aggressively misguided growth assumptions would become the only Corporations able to afford running the nodes in datacenters owned by other Corporations while still other megacorps perform all the hashing - a terribly insidious outcome.\n\nYou continue repeating this rhetoric about "only Corporations being able to afford to run nodes in datacenters owned by other Corporations" .

It's not left up to the miners to decide anymore whether they should include the transaction and reap their fees, it sets the default behavior of nodes to not even relay it to them to decide.  It deletes the transaction from the network depriving miners of their chance to earn fees, even if valid and not spam, and offers no solution to the user to fix it.  Before this PR, at least the transaction would persist and eventually get mined.  The only way now is for the user to double spend it.\n\nOf course, luckily we do have enough XT nodes and older nodes that will keep the transaction in the mempool and re-transmit it occasionally so it will get mined eventually without the user needing to double spend.  \n\nIn my opinion this node behavior (were it universal) lets an attacker do much more damage since they can now forcibly omit all transactions not paying whatever transaction fee they decide.  The most fair way to omit spam is what XT does, which is drop transactions randomly from the mempool.  This way an attacker can't decide which transactions are relayed and which aren't.\n\nRegardless, if blocks were larger it wouldn't be a problem anyway because spamming blocks full would be cost-prohibitive.  It's easy to disrupt now because there is only about 300-400 kB of transactions needed to create a queue.  With 8MB blocks the btc fee required to pull that off would increase ~25 fold and would disrupt business for a far shorter time.\n\nA fee market allows an attacker to determine exactly how much it would cost to kick all transactions off the network.

So what.': 3, "I don't see any news here, as far as I can tell MarilynJean Interactive have not done anything yet": 1, 'Gambling is a real growth area for Bitcoin\n': 2, 'Cool\n': 1, 'HENDERSON, NV / ACCESSWIRE / October 21, 2015 / MarilynJean Interactive (MJMI.QB) today announced it has entered into discussions with a provider of online gambling licenses and data hosting services.\n\nThe online gambling market is expected to exceed USD 40 billion in 2015. One of the biggest challenges faced by online gambling companies is facilitating funds transfer from users to the online operators. Credit card companies have been historically reluctant to integrate their systems with online gambling operators because of the chargeback potential. Bank transfers to online gambling sites are complicated by the fact that most operators are licensed in small countries outside the primary jurisdictions where most players reside. The result is that it can take several days for new users to open accounts. Countless potential new users are lost, having been put off by the hurdles of setting up new accounts and transferring funds.\n\nBitcoin offers a simple solution to these problems. Bitcoin transfers are both virtually instantaneous and verified multiple times through the Bitcoin blockchain and the myriad of Bitcoin miners connected to the network. Bitcoin transfers therefore solve both the speed and authentication issues faced by online gambling companies.\n\nMany internet gambling operators also face the challenge of operating in a jurisdiction with a sophisticated enough telecommunications network to manage high bandwidth secure transactions. Many of the countries that offer internet gambling licenses are small and have less robust telecom networks.\n\nMJMI has entered into discussions with a firm that offers internet gambling licenses in the country of Antigua. This firm simultaneously offers connected data services located on a native reserve in Canada. This combination allows its clients to both be licensed to offer real money wagering and operate their data centers on a first world telecommunications network. Canada is home to one of the world\'s largest publicly traded online gambling operators, Amaya Inc. (NASDAQ: AYA), parent company of mega-sites Pokerstars and Full Tilt Poker.\n\nOwing to its ultra-low transfer cost, Bitcoin also offers the advantage of easily facilitating small dollar value transfers. This means that a site allowing much smaller wagers can still be profitable. Online gambling operators of poker rooms, for example, take a small percentage of the total value wagered by players in each hand, known as a rake. With traditional currency, known as FIAT, the transfer costs necessitate higher dollar amounts be sent by players so that the funds they transfer exceed the transfer fees. With Bitcoin, the potential exists for operators to offer users the option to transfer and wager much smaller amounts, therefore dramatically increasing the potential customer base.\n\nPeter Janosi, MJMI\'s president said: "We are very excited to be in discussions with a potential partner in the online gambling space. Since we will not be targeting US customers, having a partner that can both facilitate a license in a credible jurisdiction like Antigua and offer data services in a first world country makes sense. They share our excitement about the potential Bitcoin brings to this multi-billion dollar industry. We look forward to further updating our shareholders as we make progress in this exciting space."\n\nAbout MJMI\n\nMJMI is in the business of providing safe and accessible services for the users of Bitcoin and other crypto-currencies.\n\nCrypto-currencies are a medium of exchange using cryptography to secure transactions and control the creation of new units. Bitcoin became the first decentralized crypto-currency in 2009. Crypto-currency is produced at a rate which is defined when the system is created and publicly known. By contrast, in centralized banking and economic systems, such as the Federal Reserve System, corporate boards or governments control the supply of currency by printing units or demanding additions to digital banking ledgers. However, neither companies nor governments can produce units of crypto-currency and as such the value of crypto-currencies are completely based on supply and demand, free from any governmental control. Many people believe crypto-currencies, and in particular bitcoin, hold the promise of being the most significant advancement in global finance in modern history. The advent of bitcoin creates a secure, easily accessible and transferable transnational currency that is completely liberated from political influence.\n\nMJMI is currently exploring partnerships in several verticals within the crypto-currency space, including the multi-billion dollar remittance market. Management believes that several industries, including both international remittances and online gambling are on the verge of being revolutionized by the use of Bitcoin to effect transactions.\n\nMarilynJean Media Interactive is among the first publicly traded companies focussed on bitcoin and the crypto-currency space.

We haven\'t had a big enough war or world war, and even if we do that infrastructure might or not be attacked. Bitcoin or a financial blockchain or even a replicated database system with redundancy points between cities and countries like many REAL banks have today bring resiliency against local catastrophes and have some inherent security costs. Bitcoin promotes a special type of security rewarding miners. Banks charge some money to their customers to handle their costs. Countries charge some taxes to their citizens to have some militar and legal enforcement. Do we really need half of the world investments into military to protect private property or social structures. No, it is far less. I am stating the same for bitcoin. You don\'t need half of the world\'s energy protecting the system. As soon as bitcoin or any other network or infrastructure is being used by a country and society it is in the society interest to defend it. Even if we just rely on mining defense and we leave out the incentives to defend a useful infraestructure, it is game theory. the moment it is detected that the network is being attacked through a X percent attack, other parties could try to increase their hashing rate and if the attack fades it is in everybody interest to slow the hashing rate. It could be like cold war and missile escalation, if everybody is using the infraestructure (world) and has some eggs in the basket (everybody\'s lifes) they could increase their deterrent force but it is expensive, specially in a "fantasy"  far future in which we only rely in fees.

Although quite substantially there are technical solutions such as multisig to solve that issue too.\n\nMuch securities regulation is in place to deal with accounting malfeasance because double entry ledgers are internal documents that are easy to manipulate.  \n\nFiat money itself is prone to said malfeasance. Many companies cook books. When banks do it, they conjure money supply. The balance sheet of the USD is somehow out of reach of audit by American elected representatives. Given the incestuous tangle of narrow private interests, banks, central banks, regulators, and law makers, the demonstrated malfeasance both legally sanctioned and illegal, it is little surprise it was labelled a den of vipers by a sitting American president, and a greater threat than standing armies by a "founding father".  \n\nNote that social containment (ie laws) of this malfeasance has been outright hacked. Regulation by legislation is a failure and perhaps even effecively a ruse, providing false trust and protection barriers for the crooks.  This hack is so deep that men of justice are obviously corrupted. Note the lack of political outrage that the FedRes is a bank regulator, or more viscerally that Goldman Sachs former employees hold many critical law enforcement positions. There is a special brand of corruption of men like Ben Lawsky, who in plain sight operate to protect the racket rather than acting on behalf of Justice generally. These are not vague theoretical abuses. They are terrible crimes that are demonstrated often, many legally sanctioned, many just papered over with public money.

I applaud the team over at CryptoVoter for their effort, but I personally feel it will not work out.\n\n\nThe biggest issue you have is every Bitcoin user does not have the time to become versed enough to provide guidance. When the founding fathers of the United States of America came up against the same realization they decided they would create a system where they could take turns leaving their normal lives and focusing on representing the desires and needs of their communities. **In a world of specialization every participant of a system can\'t be an expert on every specialty that affects that system.**\n\n\nAsking every person that has Bitcoin "Do you think the block size limit should be raised" is already misleading. It is like putting to vote "Do you think cars should get better gas mileage". When whatever regulation is going to provide that better gas mileage has a lot of complex variables that would take many hours to study to make an informed vote in your best interest. Another analogy would be asking my Grandmother to vote on increasing the TCP packet size because she has a computer.\n\n\nThe next issue is that in our current ecosystem large amounts of BTC are pooled under operators such as exchanges. This would give them an instant super majority on any topic they wanted to vote on.\n\nEdit: spelling': 4, "The statement that private keys are ever put online is incorrect.\n\nPrivate keys never leave the user's possession before, during or after voting, as users generate private keys locally on their machine and import them into their local wallet in order to send coins to themselves to vote, so private keys are never placed online.": 1, 'CryptoPolls is a more accurate description and less threatening too.  Point taken.': 1, 'this': 1, '> Development focused on technical merit, rather than influenced by an increase of politics\n\nThis is absolutely the point.

If changes are to be made to bitcoin that will change its value proposition then it is useful to gauge the opinion of those who own bitcoin.\n\nI am not proposing a democracy, if anything it is closer to a "poll" or a "survey," since the vote is non-binding. Furthermore, it uses the Bitcoin block chain and is open source, so it can\'t be gamed like traditional online polls.\n\nLast but not least, anyone can add questions to CryptoVoter\'s client since it is open source. The questions shown on their homepage are purely marketing and do not reflect the vote topics that may take place in the future.\n\nFWIW personally I am pro-anonymity and against blacklisting. I support all initiatives working to increase bitcoin anonymity, currently optimistic about /r/joinmarket, but ideally some sort of anonymity features will be added to Core in the future. ': 1, '> FWIW personally I am pro-anonymity and against blacklisting\n\nGood to hear :).\n\n> Bitcoin holders are the ones who ultimately put a $$ value on each bitcoin. If changes are to be made to bitcoin that will change its value proposition then it is useful to gauge the opinion of those who own bitcoin.\n\nOkay, I agree with this, but my issue is with the "voting" mechanism, since the voter is not accountable for advocating an incorrect idea. There needs to be accountability, to encourage high-quality and considered voting. In other words, voting needs to occur only when the voter has an educated reasoning, not just for the sake of voting.\n\nIn that line, I think a more advanced idea than merely voting could be to use prediction markets. See the following:\n\n* http://www.truthcoin.info/blog/win-win-blocksize/\n\n* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgjrS-BPWDQ&t=1560': 2, 'Bitcoin owes it to itself to follow Satoshi Nakamoto\'s vision, and the ideals of the cypherpunk movement from which it originates. Democracies are easily corrupted and compromised by special interests, so it is a good thing that Bitcoin does not purely follow such a model.\n\nDid you consider that CryptoVoter got no support because of the inflammatory ideas on its main page, which are mostly in opposition to the freedom inherent in Bitcoin? It betrays the founder\'s real motives.\n\n* **Remove pseudo-anonymity** <-- I think there\'s a typo. It should read: "Increase privacy and anonymity of users, so as to better resist coercion or threat of coercion"\n\n* **Blacklist stolen bitcoins** <-- Another typo? It should read: "Increase fungibility of bitcoins, so as to better mimic cash"\n\n* **Regulation compliant codebase** <-- Another typo! It should read: "Politics-resistant codebase, so as to maximize freedoms of users"\n\n* **Increase maximum block size** <-- The only legitimate idea, and one most of the ecosystem already supports, so it\'s redundant...\n\nSo yeah, if the founder of CryptoVoter wants to create "Govcoin", then he can feel free to do that? Bitcoin kindly passes.\n\n---\n\n> I do not work for or own any stake in CryptoVoter. I am completely unaffiliated, just a Bitcoin enthusiast who thinks it is a tool that could really benefit our community.\n\nI am curious, though. How do you imagine this would "benefit our community"? As I mentioned, democracies are easily corrupted. Development focused on technical merit, rather than influenced by an increase of politics in Bitcoin, would appear to be the way to go. And, the open-source nature of current Bitcoin development (over IRC, GitHub, mailing list) is aligned with that.\n\nIn what way would shifting technical decisions to people lacking technical knowledge be beneficial? Should development of nuclear reactors be subject to vote by shareholders, or should the engineers make the decisions? Should NASA outsource its space shuttle development to the people of the US to vote on how to design shuttles, or should its engineers be making development decisions?': 10, 'Great response. Good point about making voting more proportional by those having bigger stakes being enticed to research more.\n\n\nIf I may make a suggestion, perhaps reception would be cleaner if the project was branded "CryptoPolls - Provably fair polls, impossible to cheat, secured by the blockchain" or something similar. It would also appeal to more use cases.': 1, '> Remove pseudo-anonymity <-- I think there\'s a typo.

It should read: "Politics-resistant codebase, so as to maximize freedoms of users"\n> Increase maximum block size <-- The only legitimate idea, and one most of the ecosystem already supports, so it\'s redundant...\n\nThanks for bringing this up.  \n\nTo be clear, we at CryptoVoter are opposed to removing psuedo-anonymity; we are against blacklisting coins; and we do not support any measures to make the Bitcoin codebase friendly to regulation or governments...and we have no opinion on the blocksize issue.  \n\nWe listed those controversial ideas on the front page because, in the not-too-distant past, some developers have indeed considered implementing those very ideas unilaterally (but fortunately never did).\n\nAs such, we chose those extreme examples to illustrate the dangers of centralized top-down development where developers can unilaterally make changes to the Bitcoin codebase that weaken certain pro-freedom functionality without any support from the community or coin-holders/stake-holders.  \n\nThe reality is that development centralization and mining centralization are potentially serious weak points that future governments and/or corporations can one day exploit.\n\nCurrently, Bitcoin owners have no say in any controversial development matters, so we at CryptoVoter simply want to give the asset owners (e.g., Bitcoin coinholders) a voice in any controversial development issues and we listed those named issues to illustrate that point.\n\n': 1, "Another big problem that's purely practical is that voting your coins requires you to put the private keys online. The bigger your stake the less likely you are to want to do that. So this trends to disenfranchise the very people who would have the most votes": 1, "Good points.\n\nThe problem with having uneducated voters is real.  Making the votes non-binding so that developer still have the ultimate say could somewhat mitigate the issue.  Also, making voting power proportional to the number of Bitcoins owned (like shares held by a shareholder in a corporation) could incentivize those with a bigger stake in the outcome to become more informed on the issues to be voted on as well.   Again, the purpose in developing CryptoVoter was to give Bitcoin owners a voice where they previously had none and incentivize information sharing between devs, miners and coinholders.\n\nThe final issue you bring up is also a valid point.  To address the issue of unauthorized third-party fiduciaries (i.e., exchanges, mining pools, escrows, etc...) casting votes with coins in their possession, we have considered requiring +n confirmations at the voting block deadline.  Specifically, by requiring +n confirmations in order for a vote to count, voting would effectively lock up coins in order to vote, so requiring a sufficiently high +n confirmations could require coins to be locked up long enough to discourage voting by unauthorized third-party fiduciaries and vote selling.  The drawback to this approach is that it would empower longterm Bitcoin holders at the expense of short-term coin holders.  It could also lead to de-anonymization from timing attacks (h/t to muyuu).  There are additional proposals to address these issues too but didn't want to go too off-topic in our response.\n\nWhile not perfect, we are looking for a decentralized way to give Bitcoin holders a voice in development issues without changing the Bitcoin code itself, even if only as a weak non-binding check against rogue developers or mining pools deciding to make controversial changes to the code\n\nAgain, we released CryptoVoter open-source in beta to get this kind of feedback from the community and we really appreciate the comments.\n\n": 1}, ('401k, millenials and sociology', 0): {'[deleted]': 4, "If my money is taken/taxed prior to retirement (as has happened before in the history of the world) then yes...we're talking about retirement savings.": -1, 'Current issue, folks are not saving enough for retirement.
