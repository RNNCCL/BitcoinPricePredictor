We ended up having to construct the raw transactions and send them to the network itself from the salvaged wallet.dat as the reference implementation would simply hang whenever we tried to send to an address. \n\nThose small amounts you're seeing floating into the hacker's address are probably them siphening out smaller and smaller inputs while trying not to crash bitcoind :)": 3}, ('So many other coins using similar technology and concept as the bitcoin.

We are in completely agreement that we should minimize failures and that is what this is all about.\n\nWhat is interesting is that when you take alternatives completely out of the equation, as I did above, everyone seems to agree that it makes sense why the ecosystem needs to strive to solve forking risk at a higher level and probably should be done in one form or another.\n\nLet\'s keep the exact same scenario as previously mentioned and call Bitcoin Core 0.10.0 node A, Bitcoin Core 0.9.5 node B, and Bitcoin 0.9.4 node C.

This is why I call it a red herring.  Why is it that the mere mention of an alternative implementation, when nothing else about the scenario changes, magically seems to take the focus away from the fact that the network needs to gracefully handle the situation regardless?\n\nAs stated in the article, I think a consensus library is a good idea and am glad to see it happening.  It\'s a solid preventative measure that makes sense to do, but I can\'t overstate enough that it\'s not a real or final solution and should not lull people into a false sense of security.  At some point, something somewhere in the Bitcoin Core stack, even with the reduced risk a consensus library brings, is eventually going to break in one way or another.  It really is inevitable that it will happen again, so why is it that the major players, who surely know this to be true, are basically sticking their head in the sand and saying "consensus lib will fix it!"?  Unfortunately, no, it won\'t.\n\nNobody can say with 100% certainty that a change to an OS disk driver, a newer version of a compiler, the latest and greatest quantum computers, a seemingly innocuous change to the consensus library code, or one of its dependencies, etc, will not cause just one single bit of difference which leads to a fork.

What if there is consensus forking bug that slipped in there?  This absolutely can and _has_ happened.  If miners were checking against the latest version Bitcoin Core 0.10.0 as well as Bitcoin Core 0.9.5 and 0.9.4, both versions 0.9.4 and 0.9.5 would claim a block is either good or bad while the latest version 0.10.0 would claim the opposite.  The miner would immediately know that something was wrong.  They can then do several thing to avoid the fork from ever happening in the first place.  For example, remove the offending transaction(s) until all three agree.\n\nNow, compare that against the current model.  Several miners upgrade to Bitcoin Core 0.10.0.  A block that is valid on Bitcoin Core 0.10.0 is built and submitted.  All of the older Bitcoin Core versions on the network reject it, but all of those running on Bitcoin Core 0.10.0 accept it.

Bitcoin can replace the lending part through crowd funding, micro loans etc. organised programmatically. This hasn't happened yet, because there's bigger fish to fry (like letting people get Bitcoin and store it safely) but it will happen.\n\nIt's true though that banks probably won't disappear, they might just have to change their core offerings or find something else to charge fees for besides storing money, having a monopoly on large scale lending and sending international transactions.": 3, "> If a bank started offering to store your bitcoin balance with the same insurance as other accounts, people would use that service.
