I totally agree on your points, and I understand the need to A) Aim at HD wallets being default B) Protecting inexperienced users form fund loss. Indeed, towards these aims, disabling generation of single addresses is key. One thing to consider though: Since single address generation is not an option now, there are only two ways one can have "legacy" addresses" on mycelium. He either imported them, or has updated from an older app version. In the first case, I think it is safe to say he has knowledge on how to handle private keys and protect them (after all, he has them stored somewhere else to import them). In the second case, you do face the danger of a user misunderstanding and thinking that his master private key covers his legacy addresses too. In that case, the fact that as soon as someone updates he is presented with a new HD account and sees his passphrase, is indeed dangerous. Wouldn\'t it be safer if he only had his previous addresses (not an HD account), and when he wanted to generate a new address, then he would be presented with the HD account options (passphrase etc). If I am correct in that line of thought, the ability to only have legacy addresses not only isn\'t dangerous, it is rather safer in some cases. So the optimal implementation IMO would be as follows: If a wallet contains "legacy addresses", do not create an HD account on update, until user goes on to create one. If a wallet has no addresses, create a new HD account. I know that this might be a hurdle towards the aim of wider HD adoption, but just my two cents.

And we removed the ability to generate single keys, because the are not covered by the new and easier word list backup, and many people will not understand it (even if you tell them - people tend to not read the warnings etc) and if someone has a backup not backing up all of his keys, thats bad. Its hard enough to get users to make backups in the first place. Concerning the aggregate mode, that naturally went away with introducing HD accounts, cause an HD account is kind of an aggregated view over several addresses, but we understand that there is a need for seeing the aggregated balance. So we added a line showing the total balance of all active accounts, that one is in beta together with a bunch of other features, and will be released this month. I also experimented a bit with custom aggregated accounts, but there is a lot of other, more important stuff on the list, so that needs to wait. I will message you a link to the latest pre 2.0 release apk, on the mycelium server, signed with the same key as the releases from playstore. You will need to uninstall any newer version, since you can not downgrade. If you do, make sure you have all keys backed up carefully.': 5}, ('French Deep Dice', 0): {}, ('Check Out My E-Juice Website That Accepts Bitcoin!', 4): {'No worries if you want you could buy a 0mg and 6mg and mix them to make 3mg.

Usually there is a miners fee of 0.0001 btc per transaction, but Coinbase pays it for you.\n\nCoinbase and electrum aren't really connected, because in reality no company owns Bitcoin.  Bitcoin is like an open source protocol.  Its kind of like nobody owns e-mail.  You can set e-mail up on your own, but also there are companies like yahoo, and gmail that host it for you if you want it to be easier.  \n\nBut with freedom comes responsibility so make sure to take security seriously.  If you are thinking of holding a significant amount of Bitcoins, I would really recommend a Trezor to keep them safe, unless you are tech savy enough to figure out cold storage.  Check out my links above, they will help out.\n\n": 1, 'Yeah sure...they are kind of safe at coinbase.  Coinbase is a reputable company in the USA, and regulated and all that jazz.  But your coins would be safer if you take control of the funds yourself by holding your private keys.  You never know if the government is going to shut down Coinbase, or what could happen.\n\nWith Bitcoin, every address is associated with a private key.  Its cryptography. You get a public key which is your address, and a private key which controls the funds by signing for that address.  The private key is kept secret because if someone gets it, they can steal your bitcoins.  The public key is public, because others need to know your address to send you Bitcoins.\n\nCoinbase has an option called the vault, where they use a split, multi-signature scheme.  This means they split the 1 private key into 3 keys.  They keep one, and give you two of the keys.  It requires 2 of the 3 to unlock it.  If you keep your coins as Coinbase, this is a much safer option to use their "vault" option.\n\nTo set up a private wallet on a PC, just go to https://electrum.org/download.html then follow the directions for whatever Operating System you have.  Once you set it up, it gives you a list of 12 words.  Write them down on paper and don\'t lose them.  You can use those 12 words to restore your wallet, its called a seed, because it can be used to create all of your addresses/private keys for that wallet.\n\nOnce you get it set up, click the receive tab and you will see a list of your receiving addresses.  Try to use a new address everytime you make a transaction, it helps for privacy and security.  You can always generate more addresses over time.  To send, just get someone else\'s address and send the coins to their address under the send tab.\n\nAlso you should check out [cold storage](http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/2o09eb/using_electrum_and_bootable_ubuntu_usb_to_create/) for more security over your wallets.  Also there are hardware wallets like the [Trezor](http://buytrezor.com/).  It allows you to hold bitcoins on the Trezor device, and sign transactions completely offline, which makes it basicaly impossible for hackers to steal your keys.  Trezor is the gold standard for security and is also really simple for newbies.  Overtime hardware devices will probably get a lot cheaper to buy.\n\nEdit:  You can also check out paper wallets.  One way to make paper wallets is to use [bitaddress](https://www.bitaddress.org)\n\n': 2, 'Yep, Bitcoins are basically stored in a "cloud", but it\'s a bit more complex than that.  When you have money in a traditional bank, that money is stored digitally on the bank\'s hard drives.  You trust the bank to not screw up and delete your money or give it to someone else.  Bitcoin eliminates this trust by decentralizing the process of storing and updating the books.  So instead of one bank, there are tens of thousands of "miners" and "nodes" that are all keeping copies of the "blockchain".  They are constantly verifying the contents, ensuring nobody can cheat.  The whole process is an amazing computer science innovation that\'s never been done before Bitcoin came along, and you can learn more about it in this vid:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9jOJk30eQs\n\nI would recommend you invest more.

That sheet of paper, I'd argue, at least has an attack surface we can understand and quantify. With software, there is always one more bug.": 1, "So compared to other similar wallets it offers better security?

I'm delighted that breadwallet exists and has such a conscientious developer.\n\nRegardless of what my long term storage methods are, it sounds like I would love bread wallet. I don't suppose, despite its weaker security, you're planning an android version?": 1, 'Check out the FAQ, there is a lot of good info there to start: http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/2msvrl/rbitcoin_faq_newcomers_please_read/': 1, '> I suggest Mycelium/Breadwallet and Trezor for higher amounts.\n\nApologies, I think I misinterpretted your use of "and" in the above.  You meant:\n\n"I suggest Mycelium/Breadwallet for day-to-day and Trezor for higher amounts".': 3, 'The most important thing about getting into bitcoin is taking your time to understand what you\'re getting into.  There really is no rush.  Bitcoin will still be here after you\'ve taken the time to learn about it and there are a lot of great resources available to you.  You\'ll see a lot of people around here that are very excited all the time (you\'ll hear "to the moon" a lot) but it is important to look at your current situation and only put in what you would be ok with losing.\n\nWith that being said, you have so many wallet options!  Like someone already said, you can use different wallets for different purposes.  I personally use multiple wallets depending on what I am doing with my funds.\n\nFor my on-the-go spending money, I use a wallet called BitWallet for IOS.  I like it because of the ability to generate an HD wallet (does not stand for high definition) as well as many other great features.  Breadwallet is also a good IOS app that a lot of people like around here.  For android phones, Mycelium is definitely the way to go.  Blockchain.info (an online client) also has a mobile based app that I have had good experiences with (a lot of people may tell you to avoid them right now due to a bit of trouble they ran into with security recently, but they have been a fixture in the community for a while now and I still like them).\nThere\'s a guy around here (/u/BashCo) that does great write-ups on these wallets, if you see him around he can tell you almost anything you want to know.  \n\nOther than the mobile wallets, there are also desktop clients.  The original bitcoin core client is very good but you have to download the entire block chain to use it (the blockchain is the public ledger of every transaction ever) and it is ~25 GB right now.  Wallets that require this are known as heavy wallets and can be a little much for first time users.  If you would like to start out with something a bit more manageable that I would suggest looking at electrum or multibit.  Both are lightweight clients and do not require you to download the entire blockchain and are very easy to understand and use.  Both have been around for a while and have good reputations in the bitcoin community.  \n\nIf you made it this far and want to start looking into other ways to secure your funds, hardware wallets are something worth looking into due to the high level of security they offer.  As of now, the main hardware wallet out there is the Trezor.  What it does is it takes your private key (the all important thing that allows you, and you alone, to spend/own your bitcoins) and stores it securely offline (similar to cold storage but without all the hassle of paper wallets).  You can then use your hardware device to authorize transactions you wish to make without having to have your private key exposed to a potentially compromised computer.\n\nYou mentioned coinbase as one you were looking at.  I would suggest that you purchase your bitcoins through them, but once you receive them, move them out of the exchange wallet to a wallet you control completely.  This will protect you from anything bad that may happen to the exchange.  In the bitcoin world, there has been more that one instance where exchanges have gone down, been hacked, or something.  Keeping your coins in wallets you control, and out of wallets based on exchanges, protects your coins from being lost due to factors that you either can\'t control or don\'t see coming.  \n\nI only suggested a few but there are many more.  Since you\'re new, I\'d suggest trying out multiple ones with tiny amounts of bitcoin and find one that you like and stick with it!': 9, "Bitcoin core isn't recommend for average users.": 2, "True, it is a very broad question. I'm more so looking for information on the different types of wallet to better inform my decision.

Classic. ': 1, 'Price not viral.': 8, "This question is kind of the heart of the issue - what makes Bitcoin scarce. That's what makes it different from all previous attempts at creating digital cash. Earlier efforts were based around a much more traditional concept - some centrally controlling company simply states by decree (by fiat, if you will) that 'there are 1 billion X bucks' - or used the concept of backing - each unit of e-gold was backed by a certain amount of physical gold in a vault. The latter had the advantage of theoretically preventing excessive money printing because gold can't be conjured out of nothing, but it still suffered the massive weakness of centralized control, meaning that either the owner could be dishonest, or he could be attacked by governmental entities (the latter actually happened). The former of course has a more obvious weakness - it entirely relies on trusting that the central controlling entity won't be tempted to print more money.\n\nBitcoin doesn't try to *back* a digital asset with a physical asset like gold, but tries to recreate its scarcity through limiting production through the requirement to do work (use up energy). You can't mine bitcoins without expending physical work, and what's more the algorithm used to determine how many bitcoins are produced per unit of work ratchets up or down according to how much energy the whole bitcoin network is expending per second. This allows the rate of production to be controlled.\n\nHowever even that's not the full story; that tells you how it's possible to have a fixed rate of production per unit time (which steadily reduces, reaches zero by around 2140), but there is still the question of consensus. Bitcoin is open source code and any individual node in the network can run a modified version of the software if they want; nobody will stop them. But here's where the *openness* of the protocol creates its magic - if I run a node and try to assign myself a larger number of bitcoins per unit of energy expenditure, or just that randomly gives me X extra bitcoins everyone else on the network sees that I'm not following the rules, and rejects my transactions. Since no one is incented to allow anyone else to create extra bitcoins for themselves (since that would reduce the value of my own holdings), we have a very strong stable equilibrium. For 6 years already, that consensus has been maintained.\n\nIt should be noted that people *are* incented to 'make up their own bitcoins' by creating alternative networks running a bitcoin-like algorithm - for example, Litecoin. However, the strength of these networks is a function of how well they defend against attacks - if they're very small, what's to stop a bunch of other people coming in with a lot of mining power (a lot of energy to expend) and take over their network, and screw up the consensus? The more you think about it, the more you realise that Bitcoin's network effect is not just 'more people accept Bitcoin than Litecoin' - it's also the actual physical power of the network that gives it strength.\n\nIf you want to understand Bitcoin properly, read the whitepaper bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf, or for a lighter introduction read the various FAQs such as the one on that website.": 4, "Well in fact it *is* a limited resource.

And the best reason to buy bitcoin as a speculative investment is because you believe that its properties (which, in short, combine the reliable scarcity of a commodity like gold with the transactional efficiency of a purely digital medium) will enable Bitcoin, over time, to steal market share from other forms of money that lack those properties.': 9, 'This overview is from 2012.

If you believe in bitcoin enough to accept it fully,  you understand the deflationary nature of it and despite short term loss possibilities,  you would never want to \'lock in\' a dollar value of bitcoin considering the inflationary nature of the dollar.

': 3, "That was a very bearish interpretation IMO, I'll offer the inverse, for balance of course...\n\nOptimism saturation as you imply is not necessarily why the price no longer goes up on good news but always goes down with bad news now days. We've had a huge year with massive amounts of bad developments, the loss of MtGox removed a huge amount of not only Bitcoins, but also fiat liquidity from the Bitcoin market, so it's certain that this has impeded market growth, and also represented a large loss of users and along with it adoption, rebuilding that user base and liquidity takes time, but we've also seem much greater adoption by merchants with higher profiles etc. naturally this new liquidity coupled with the still high inflation of new coins means market supply is likely outstripping demand. New users don't like to buy more coins in a bear market also, and lower prices also spurs holders to spend/sell to avoid/prevent loss. This also makes them less inclined to rebuy, or buy more because of Bitcoin's continued uncertainty.\n\nAs far as volatility affecting underbanked and unbanked, services are already appearing that will help hedge volatility to protect users' value so this is becoming less and less of a problem, this also has little affect on remittances which the under/unbanked are far more likely to want/need in any case, so their barriers to Bitcoin adoption is not high as some like to portray.\n\nAs far as Bitcoin's stigma is concerned, most is hyperbole, baseless and mostly generated from misinformation, and lack of education. Even in light of that, Bitcoin has literally endured 4.5 years of bad press and this supposed domino effect that would potentially scare away adoption and growth has not eventuated. Merchants and charities are not scared of accepting Bitcoin any more than they are scared of accepting cash. What they HAVE been scared of is the legal uncertainty, as banks have been known to cut off Bitcoin startups and businesses that get involved in Bitcoin, this is a very real danger for merchants and definitely has slowed adoption and pushed Bitcoin acceptance to the fringes. Merchants are rarely gamblers or risk takers. Lack of regulatory certainty is what will keep many away and will probably be that way into 2015 until real legislation/policy/guidelines is enacted that merchants can assure themselves that they are acting within the law and that banks aren't going to retaliate against them for being involved with Bitcoin.\n\nHigh-ish inflation will only last another 1.5 years because of the current difficulty increases of late, after that it will be lower than most existing currencies, so even if no/few new users enter the martket, scarcity will rise regardless, so unless there is an abandonment of Bitcoin in the next 2 years then the chances of a price rise is strong. As for expecting Bitcoin to be on par with Facebook and the like, It took the [EU 6 years on it's own to just *plan* to roll out the Euro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro#Introduction), and credit card saturation took a huge amount of money and ~~coercion~~ promotion on the banks' part to roll out credit cards and facilities, and took [30 years to reach >70% saturation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card#Development_of_credit_cards_outside_North_America). 6 years is a blip in the [lifetime of a currency](http://www.rapidtrends.com/history-of-fiat-and-paper-money-failures/), and many traditional fiat currencies haven't even lasted that long.

Coins are handed out in a "mining competition" every 10 minutes, which also validates transactions across the network.\n\nMost people will buy and sell Bitcoins at an exchange, just like any other currency.\n\nTo "hold" Bitcoins you use a program called a "wallet". With your wallet program you will create a **private key** and public key (**bitcoin address**). The private key is kept secret in your wallet (normally password protected incase someone steals your PC) and mathematically confirms that you own any BTC sent to your bitcoin address.\n\nSome websites store Bitcoin online, however this is often unsafe as they have control over your BTC. Several have suffered major hacks or accidents in the past (I heard of 10K of other people\'s BTC being accidentally deleted by a hapless server admin - that\'s several million USD today).\n\nBitcoin addresses are long strings, however we also use QR codes and phone apps for easy usage. Your private key can be copied (think of it like a password to your Bitcoin "account").

Whoever created this currency had to have some way to distribute it while maintaining its legitimacy.\n\nIf he were to give some to his best friends first, no one would want to use the currency because it would be unfair for a few people to start with so much. So instead of distributing the currency himself to chosen people, he decided to just give it away to anyone who was interested. Mining is the way people showed that they were interested in having some bitcoin. \n\nSo then he decided to code the protocol to release the coins in blocks every 10 minutes. If you were mining, you were just trying to solve a simple math problem, this showed the protocol you were interested. If you got the problem correct first, you were awarded the bitcoins in that block. \n\nAt first only a few people were interested, so the odds of them winning the block were very high. Today hundreds of thousands of people are interested, with very powerful computers. So the odds of winning the block are much lower. Still mining remains a way to distribute the currency to whoever is interested. \n\nThe cool part is that whoever created it combined the mining aspect with the confirmation of transactions. So while people try to mine for bitcoins they are simultaneously confirming transactions. This is what allows bitcoin to be self sustaining. \n\nI hope that clarifies and simplifies what exactly mining is. Today most beginners do not mine.
