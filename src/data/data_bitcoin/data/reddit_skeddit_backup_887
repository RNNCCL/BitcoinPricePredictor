They aren't dumping it on the market and they aren't selling on a Bitcoin exchange but instead a stock exchange. ": 1, '> they will buy coins at the open market and issue new shares in the ETF.\n\nThat somewhat depends. The ETF as it\'s filed on Edgar only has room for 200,000 total bitcoins, which will be represented by 1,000,000 ETF shares. "Authorized Participants" may deposit baskets of 10,000 bitcoins into the ETF in exchange for 50,000 shares which will then be sold on the broker-dealer market. The only way bitcoins will be removed from the trust is if an institutional investor acquires 50,000 shares that can be redeemed for 10,000 bitcoins - but since that represents 5% of the proposed issue of stock that\'s unlikely. The coins will essentially be in cold storage.\n\nReally, all the ETF does is allow the creators to sell as many of their own bitcoins as they want at market value without tanking the price, and the remainder is up to the institutional investors to procure themselves - either through quiet negotiation with whales who are willing to sell, or by outright purchase on an exchange which will affect the price.\n\nAny price boost will be limited to the small percentage of that 200,000 coins which will be purchased on the open market. Otherwise the ETF will just be a secondary market trading mechanism that\'s entirely independent of the wider bitcoin market. \n\n\nEdit: The scary part of the filing is: *The Sponsor\xe2\x80\x99s Fee is [     percent] of the daily net assets of the Trust and will accrue daily in US Dollars and will be payable \xe2\x80\x9cin kind\xe2\x80\x9d (in bitcoins) monthly in arrears. To pay the Sponsor\xe2\x80\x99s Fee, as soon as practicable after the completion of any calendar month, the Trust will calculate, using the Winkdex spot price on such calculation day, the number of bitcoins required to pay the outstanding Sponsor\xe2\x80\x99s Fee and transfer such bitcoins from the Trust Custody Account to an account maintained by the Trustee for the Sponsor (\xe2\x80\x9cSponsor Custody Account\xe2\x80\x9d).*\n\nSo, even if an institutional investor acquires 50,000 shares to redeem 10,000 bitcoins, they won\'t get 10,000 bitcoins because the twins will be leeching a daily percentage of those coins on a monthly basis. It gives them incentives to sell all of their coins as they will receive them back over time, minimizing the potential for the ETF to affect the market price.': 1, "Holy shit, they're actually calling it the Winkdex?

For one reason or another, it can't hurt to do so. In Storj's case, even if data is encrypted, decentralization offers a few advantages:\n \n1) Nodes will constantly try to offer the cheapest storage. This 'competition' of sorts helps provide the cheapest price possible for people trying to store data - far cheaper than current providers.\n  \n2) Because both storage space *and* bandwidth are resources on the Storj network, the decentralized nature can still be just as efficient as a centralized host.  \n  \n3) I'll be using Megaupload as my example here.

All you have to do is share both the hash and key for your file and anyone can download it (of course, if you don\'t want someone doing that, your key should not be shared).\n\nThere\'s also talk of building all kinds of decentralized services on top of Storj, such as decentralized video sharing, etc. once the network matures.\n\n**Attack Vector**\n\nI\'ll call your specific attack the "Honest Pinnochio Collusion" attack :) Basically, a centralized entity controls many nodes that do honestly store files, but that he can "pull the strings" on them all simultaneously at any time.\n\nThere may not be one single prevention method (possibly a combination of several), but here is a potential one:\n\nA pseudo-reputation system can be implemented and the "reputation" of nodes could be recorded in an immutable fashion on a blockchain (e.g. number of successful heartbeats vs. failures). Heartbeats could be extended into what I\'ll call for the moment a PING-PONG. A farmer holding a file chunk can send a PING back to the client that says "Hi! I have your file chunk, can I get some of that lovely cryptocurrency?" However, with the PING the farmer also sends some currency that is protected until the transaction is completed (e.g. by an Oracle or eventually by an Ethereum contract, etc.). The client then sends a PONG which is a traditional heartbeat described in the paper. If everything goes well, the farmer gets paid for storing the chunks and gets the withheld fee back.\n\nNewer farmers can have higher fees withheld than farmers with a greater reputation (e.g. as recorded on a blockchain). The withheld fee could also be the same regardless of how much storage you offer the network. The idea would be that if you only run a node or a few nodes (with as much space as you want), then losing that withheld fee would be a much smaller pain than someone running tens of thousands of micronodes that then shuts them off all at once. This also encourages decentralization of the network.\n\nThe idea is that it would be very expensive to mount such an attack, though not impossible.\n\nOther factors that will help mitigation are creating a very large network. We also have nodes run by autonomous agents on the drawing board, but that\'s still in its very early stages.': 1, 'Yeah, I expect openbazaar to change the game.': 2, 'Yea, I was being a bit snarky.': 2, "> threat of punishment would see everyone abandon morality and turn into rabid frothing packs of flesh-eaters\n\nAnd the roads!

So 5x redundancy, 10x? I just increase the size of my attack and will always have a certain chance to be the only one storing one person\'s data.
