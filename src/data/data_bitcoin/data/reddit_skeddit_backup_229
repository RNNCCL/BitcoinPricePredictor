Early adopters of gold, therefore, would have reaped huge benefits.\n\nThere are several examples, of course, where early adopters got punished. A couple examples: the Antoninianus (intended successor to the Denarii), the Continental ("not worth a continental").

Yes, bitcoin will have a wealth disparity, at least at first, because it *rewards its early adopters*. It would not be adopted otherwise. Bitcoin will continue to be in an "early adopter" phase until it achieves dominance over fiat money, which could take generations if it ever happens. Bitcoin is designed to reward everyone who invests in this phase. This is not a bug, this is a feature. \n\nAlso, the same lady mentions that bitcoin is inferior to fiat money because fiat money gets invested, while bitcoin "just sits there". This completely misses the point that bitcoin allows you to invest *in anything you want, with no intermediary*. Yes, if you want to let your bitcoins sit and collect dust because they\'re a great investment (which they will continue to be throughout the early adopter phase), you can do so. Or, if you\'re unsatisfied with the returns on that investment, you can use it to invest in other crypto-ventures which may have a faster return on investment. By contrast, in the fiat world (at least in the US), you *can\'t* invest in private startups because **it\'s illegal to invest in private companies unless you\'re an accredited investor (meaning very wealthy)**. You *have* to put your money in a bank, let them "invest" it on your behalf, then accept the pennies they throw you in return, instead of the huge returns they get by investing in successful startups. \n\nOnce bitcoin\'s early adopter phase is over, holding bitcoin won\'t be such a good investment. It\'ll still be better than giving it to a bank, but there\'s no reason to expect that people will just let their coins collect dust when there are promising crypto-ventures everywhere. I\'m sick of people criticizing bitcoin\'s flaws as though they are permanent. It\'s a startup currency, something that has never existed.

Shiny things are desirable because men can give them to their wives to accent their beauty, proving the man is powerful.  Gold as a currency just seems like a natural consequence of these conditions, since it also has the additional attributes of scarcity and durability. So I don't think there were ever people that didn't value gold; at least an amount of it useful for jewelry.  You wouldn't trade *all* of your food and weapons for a shiny rock, but you might trade some of them, just like most people would with fiat currency today.\n\nThe Continental and the Antoninianus were failures because they were intentionally devalued by their issuers, not because they weren't widely adopted.

From the language and explanations on their site, it's pretty clear to me that this is a classic ponzi scheme, except leveraging the internet and bitcoin to inflate to a huge scale. They are relying on constantly attracting new investors in order to achieve their high payouts. This really isn't sustainable, at some point new investment will stall, the money will dry up and the scheme will implode. It could be 2 weeks from now, or 2 years from now, but to me it is inevitable.\n\nNow if you agree that MMM is supplying a lot of new demand from bitcoin, then it seems almost certain that when it implodes, this demand disappears. The price needs demand to be stable to hold a given level, if the demand reduces, then the price must reduce accordingly, the miners are continuously selling to cover their expenses. \n\nSecondly, if MMM is contributing net supply for bitcoin, then it must be that someone is holding that coin. It is still the case that bitcoin is almost useless as a day to day currency, so these people will eventually want their local cash. When the scheme closes they will have no more reason to hold, and will sell, especially if the uptrend stops, and starts reversing.\n\nThirdly, assuming this uptrend has been triggered by the increased demand from MMM, but once the trend is started, it feeds itself by drawing in enthusiasm and buyers from everywhere else. If the pressure from MMM disappears or reverses, this enthusiasm from elsewhere will also stall, and likely reverse aswell. You get feedback on the way down (2014), as well as on the way up (2013).\n\nSure their use of bitcoin does highlight the strength of the technology, but that doesn't take away from the fact that they're running a ponzi scheme and it will die a fiery death.
