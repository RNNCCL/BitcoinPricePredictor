It takes a fair amount of reading and research to have a good understanding of Bitcoin and the blockchain.  This is something that the average person just doesn\'t care about at all.  So yes, I think you\'re correct in that if you try to explain to someone the intricacies of Bitcoin, you\'re going to lose them very quickly.\n\nPeople just want to know what it is, what it does, and why they should use it. The "what it is" and "what it does" is difficult to properly illustrate for people, in my experience, so I\'ve stopped trying to go the technical route entirely.  When someone asks me to explain bitcoin to them, I don\'t lead off by talking about the technology. Instead, I lead off by asking them a few loaded questions.\n\n"Do you remember what the internet was like in the mid-1990\'s?  Do you remember the first time you used email to communicate with someone via the internet?"\n\nI\'m setting them up to think about the way an emerging technology changed & shaped their lives less than 20 years later.  It doesn\'t really matter if they actually have an answer for my questions, the point is that you\'ve shown them how a fledgling idea can grow to become an integral part of everyone\'s daily lives over time, that a concept like Bitcoin can eventually grow to become a "currency of the internet".\n\nAnd that\'s how I lead into the "What" bitcoin is question:  It\'s a currency for the internet.  I harken back to the email and internet reference and ask them what the internet would be like if we had never built email, and people still had to call each other using traditional land lines and cell phones routed through the commercial telephone system.  I then compare that to eCommerce on the internet today.  We\'re still using a legacy payment system that worked fine for what we had in the past, but now we\'re all purchasing more and more things directly from merchants via the internet.  Yet we\'re still using the same legacy payment systems we\'ve had since before the internet to make payments online.\n\nI then transition into all the data breaches that companies endure, and remind the person how much data they are unknowingly distributing out into the world, and that they are blindly trusting major companies to protect that information, but often those companies can\'t protect the information.  With bitcoin, you\'re not projecting your private personal information out into the world.\n\nFrom there I usually stop and let them ask any questions they have about what I\'ve already told them.  I\'ll clarify anything they want as granularly as they want.  \n\nAfter that I\'ll talk about the blockchain and how it\'s a pseudonymous (not anonymous) distributed ledger and makes up the meat and bones of why I feel Bitcoin is the next big emergence in economics.  I can take it any direction from here, but typically I will lead off with the concept that we are so early on in the development of Bitcoin and blockchain technology that we still have yet to understand all the potential applications of the blockchain in our society.  I try to take as many real world things as I can and layer the block chain on top of them.  Contracts?  They could be entered into the blockchain with a simple transaction, and it\'s forever recorded there.  Deeds & Titles?  Another thing that blockchain can be used for.  Distributed Voting systems?  Blockchain technology can assist with that.\n\nOnly then will I even begin to talk about the most obvious case uses such as remittances and moving assets worldwide.  I try to focus on instilling my own sense of wonder for Bitcoin into them.  It\'s not enough to tell them what Bitcoin and the blockchain are.  You have to make them see that it\'s something on par with the creation of the internet.  Something that still is learning how to walk right now, but soon enough it will be walking, then jogging, then sprinting.  Finally, my background is finance & investments, so I\'ll usually tell them that the potential long term returns for an early investor is exponential due to the fixed supply of coins that will be produced.  There aren\'t many investment opportunities that come around in life that offer you the chance to make 10X your money, but I think this is one of them.  Most of my friends respect my opinions, and I can convey my thoughts well, so usually my explanations have a positive effect and the person I\'m speaking with is left with a new outlook on Bitcoin.

You would better say "The math behind ECDSA".\n\nIn Bitcoin a "public key" we don\'t use ECDSA directly, instead the rules to authenticate the transfer of a coin are expressed using Script--  Script is a novel cryptosystem that allows you to express complex expressions in non-zero-knowedlge.  One of the operations it can do is ECDSA to prove knoweldge of a discrete log... but it\'s perfectly possible to make transactions without using ECDSA.\n\nSome other random nits:\n> and a fair amount of intrigue, surrounds the selection of appropriate parameters. After all, a large, seemingly random number could hide a backdoor method of reconstructing the private key.\n\nThere is no intrigue in the secp256k1 parameters unlike the NSA provided NIST ones.  The parameters we use are reproducable from first principles as this sage script does:  https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=289795.msg3206788#msg3206788\n\nThere is nothing random about these numbers.\n\n>  As a reminder, in step 4, if the numbers result in a fraction (which in real life they almost always will), the numerator should be multiplied by the inverse of the denominator.\n\nThis is confusing.  The numbers involved aren\'t integers. They are numbers (mod n)-- they\'re on the finite field defined by the order of the group. You _always_ multiply by the multiplicative inverse of K (mod n) here.   (Though I imagine it would lose most readers if it tried to explainin any more number theory... :) )\n\nI guess the more important piece of understanding is how ECDSA actually constutes a signature.  The verifier is effectively challenging the signer to name an encrypted point on a line between the the message and the private key times the nonce.  \n\nBecause of the homorphism of the cyclic group  (that  if a+b=c then ag + bc = cg) you can do this line test in the encrypted domain.\n\nThis also helps form the intuition why reusing k (or using predictable or linearly related ones) leaks the private key.\n\nIt\'s a bit easier to explain with schnorr.  DSA is the bastard stepchild of sch\nnorr which was design to work around the schnorr patent, and as a result it\'s slower and hard to reason about.\n\nThere is a sage notebook on http://bitcoin.ninja that you can use to try out EC math on Bitcoin\'s curve.': 18, 'you know your thing!': 1, "That's really interesting.

That's not an acquisition. That's when company B hires an employee who also works at company A. THAT'S IT. So if I work in a grocery store and I then get hired in a clothing store, that's an acquisition according to them. That's literally what they said they did, and they called it an acquisition. It's beyond ridiculous.\n\nAnd then when company A goes bankrupt, which apparently according to them, does not own at all company B and shouldn't at all affect what they do at company B, they quit at company B and walk away, despite users still missing their funds, despite company B going to shit, take the product offline and walk out.\n\nThat's not a red flag? It's not a red flag when a company raises 500 BTC with hyperbolic promises that don't come true and miss every deadline, but only become bigger, not smaller promises? When employees do 'IRC soaks' and just give away $15k of funds intentionally, or perhaps worse, when they did it accidentally because they added one 0 too many? \n\nThey ran this thing as if it was one big joke.

We submit ourselves to rule, because we believe we are too irresponsible to wield sovereignty ourselves, yet as we do so, the government to which we yield our responsibility is seen as a useful tool for the selfish among us to get what they want out of us.  \n\nWe are punished for giving our power away to authority by the very things that we thought we were fixing by giving that authority away, selfish behaviors.  Thanks to the Internet, we can see that often times, we are just being scared into giving up our sovereignty/freedom due to false or exaggerated, constructed fears propagated by those selfish people that seek to gain something by our acquiescence to their claimed authority.  Let us monitor your communications.  Let us decide what can be banned.  Let us govern the Internet.  We will keep you safe from cyber-terrorism.  We will keep you safe from cyber-bullying.  We will keep the children safe.  It's all just a sham, a replacement for our personal responsibility with an illusory comfort blanket that is more of a straight jacket in disguise.  We know this only because we have seen an Internet without rules, without authority to effectively enforce them.  Imagine how much less of an Internet we'd have if we let authorities govern it early on.  It's clearly better to do the minimum, maintaining the integrity of IP routing and DNS systems and not micromanaging behaviors on the Internet.\n\nLicensing Bitcoin is a similar situation.  Why do we need the permission of authority to make economic exchange between each other freely?  We are scared of boogeymen.  Oh no, the big bad drug dealers are going to launder money without being caught by the $10,000+ mandatory reporting rule they continuously work around.  So, we need to arrest, fine and imprison people for selling Bitcoin in a free economic exchange.  Yet, when banks are caught laundering hundreds of millions of dollars for exact same criminal element, the authorities determine that nobody needs to go to prison.  People could be scammed by dishonest merchants and money changers.  *Gasp*, let's make licenses for them to operate and it will fix everything.  Yet, at the end of the charade, we end up with less freedom and no actual solution to the problems cited as reasons to cede our control to authority.  Seeking license *is* asking for permission from a controller, nothing more, even if it is done with good intentions by the one asking for the license and by the authority granting it.  We never seem to learn that *WE* are the real power in this world, even as we give it away to be wielded as one larger unit by authority.  We can either accept the risks and rewards of freedom or we can accept the walled garden of limited possibilities granted by authority, but the choice is really ours.
