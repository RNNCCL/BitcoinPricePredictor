The fact of the matter is that it might end up being a longer span of time from it last hitting $1k till now than from now to it hitting $1k again, but fiat currencies are always being inflated, and governments tend to adopt policies to continue inflating them over time.\n\nBut yes, when it does surpass $1k again, it could be that others see it as more legitimate.

For those sufficiently familiar, it sounds .. like .. an exploit that stupid people would try to sneak value out of, and thus an obviously unsustainable scam.\n\nIt is also confusing because it does a poor job communicating to people that the primary intention is to *buy* and *sell* this new currency in exchange for either older currencies, or directly for goods and services. It spawns in their imagination an idea that "other people are using this for things I don\'t understand, but I can beat the rush to start minting it to sell off to them!"\n\nThe truth, and the challenge to communicate, is that the *work* of notarizing the ledger is a *real job* that costs significant custom computing horsepower times electricity to perform. Any computer can *in principal* try to shoulder this burden (for example, as a hobby), but without expensive custom hardware, they will be doomed to spend many times more in electricity than this work could ever earn them.\n\nThis work is *remunerated by a voluntary transaction fee market*, since every transaction must include a small fee to ensure rapid confirmation. To help keep those fees small, and to jump start the efforts of notaries early in the network, *and* to initialize the money supply itself.. those fees are also supplemented with a subsidy of newly mined bitcoin that diminishes slowly over time as our target money supply is reached.\n\nI guess, among other troubles, it\'s so hard to talk about "working and being compensated in Bitcoin" given how few other good examples are popular today that we can point to for a comparison. We haven\'t yet really developed a "job market" per se, I guess partly because the niches where Bitcoin shines the most such as international payments traditionally don\'t have much in the way of labor markets.

The reason this is useful is because smart contracts don\'t have internet access, so they can\'t check an API or google the answer.  Instead, you\'re stuck trusting a third party or using a distributed oracle system like Augur.\n\nBasically, we\'ve proposed the first one of these questions in our system on the live Ethereum testnet, as opposed to just running simulations on our own computers': 6, 'Just in case, ELI4 also.

So if x is too low then you\'re right, the sidechained bitcoin wouldn\'t be very secure.\n\nAn interesting scenario where bitcoin miners & security of a sidechain decouple are if you\'re using an algorithm that current sha-256 asics can\'t be easily made to use (and now you\'re practically dependent solely on your own chain\'s miners for security, and not # of bitcoin miners merge mining - because they cant).  \n\nIf it\'s sha256 proof of work and not mined by a significant portion of Bitcoin\'s network, you definitely have a security problem (provided your chain has enough value to make it worth attacking).  \n\nTldr: If sha256, portion of bitcoin miners mining your sidechain is a good rule of thumb for security.

Have been working on our alpha lately but when I have time I'll post a blog post of how something like this would work\n\nEdit: a distributed federated peg like this is impractical due to the slow state of http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~stevenag/threshold_sigs.pdf threshold signatures.

Last I read it was buyer, seller and arbitrator each throw in a key, if all goes well buyer and seller handle releasing funds otherwise arbitrator sides with buyer or seller for the second key in a 2-of-3 for instance. \n\nNo, I don\'t believe so. There\'s issues with a disappearing arbitrator, bc then the 2 sigs required to release funds must be used by buyer and seller, and the issue is why would you sign off on a transaction paying either the buyer or seller ONLY (bc Bitcoin reqs spending the entire output)? Also, they have to trust that the recipient would follow through on whatever agreement was decided (ie a 50/50 split must be sent to vendor or buyer, and the vendor/buyer then is trusted to send the 50/50 split instead of keeping the full amount).\n\nAlso, the DNM BlackBank has set up escrow which *looks* like multisig, but the notion that they can release funds immediately with a special code means the site has setup multisig off-chain, or they\'ve done a `2 of 3 keys OR just a masterkey`. I think the latter, since they only accept compressed keys (scriptSig space limits).\n\nAlso, it\'s ridiculous to expect escrow agents to offer free service unless they arbitrate.

Besides I found libsnark seems to have been open-sourced already. Linked in my post above.': 1, 'Mike Hearns\' continued dismissal of PoW is somewhat disturbing. No superior alternative to PoW exists.\n\nBitcoin works by finding consensus. Finding consensus can only work if no single entity can game the outcome by somehow representing a significant percentage (or worse - the majority) of the votes. When voting in a democracy, a person walks up to a voting booth, is identified, casts their vote and is registered to ensure they cannot vote again. In a trustless environment where participants can only interact with each other over communication lines, there are some severe limitations to deal with.\n\nFirst of all: what should constitute a vote? A person? But how to verify if there is really an actual person behind a vote? And if there is, how to avoid this person from impersonating another person? Remember, all you have is communications. So, as Mike Hearn once suggested, a person may identify themselves with their unique ID which is part of a modern passport. However the problem with this is that lists of these IDs circulate on the net and it is trivial to impersonate hundreds of people. Then, perhaps one IP address to represent one vote? Also problematic as IP addresses can be spoofed and an owner of a large (/8) network could potentially cast millions of votes.\n\nGeneralized, the problem is: how to verify by communication only that some entity has exclusive control over a physical good, so that this good can be used as an unspoofable voting token?\n\nSatoshi understood that the only thing that cannot be spoofed is *processing power*. It is impossible to fake the capability to do more calculations per second than you actually can. The key is that processing power proofs exclusive control over actual, unspoofable physical equipment (computers) and *the amount of processing power one has, is verifiable over a communication line*. PoW can be a simple calculation: repeating a one-way hashing function whose outcome is fully random (SHA256). The faster one is, the more computing power one controls, and the more voting power one deserves. This creates a more or less level playing field. In order to get more voting power, one needs to acquire more hashing power (first CPUs, then GPUs, then FPGAs, and currently ASICs). But since anyone can buy hashing power, it becomes cost prohibitive for a single hashing entity to obtain more than half of all hash power. Also, excessive voting power cannot be obtained with some trick - hash power cannot be spoofed.\n\nThere is really nothing else that can be conceived which cannot be spoofed over a communication line. (The one exception is perhaps coin ownership, utilized by altcoins which replace PoW by "Proof of Stake", where one cryptographically proofs control over an amount of coin on the blockchain. PoS however is believed to be inherently flawed - but that\'s a whole different topic.)\n': 8, "That's a meta-consensus issue.

Essentially the payment processor just assists in selling the bitcoins locally for cash that is delivered to the merchant.   So the payment processor sends to the merchant a text message containing a claim code for each $100 of payments received.  That cash buyer of the coins drops off the $100 and in exchange gets the code which enables that buyer to go online and claim the $100 worth of coins (e.g., after being unlocked on Coinapult).\n\nThe merchant could, of course, transfer, spend (or sell) the coins by itself without waiting for the accumulation threshold to be reached.\n\nThere are other improvements that could be done as well, especially for those merchants with smartphone or web access.   But this should be enough that any small merchant that wants to test the waters can begin without much risk and without hardly any expense (e.g., hardware expense, training the staff, etc.)': 2, 'Merchant mode does a small subtle change.\n\nNormally after a payment, the user is taken to the Transaction Details screen where they can tag the transaction with meta data.\n\nFor merchants, they generally want to go back to the Receive screen to punch in a new payment request.
