It's configuration details literally don't exist anywhere until you boot up the OS and restore the wallet by entering the 12 words. They even included an On Screen Keyboard for safely avoiding hw keyloggers when entering your key words.

(Depending on your jurisdiction, this may be considered money transmission or money service business activity). \n\nIt won't be a passive thing, you'll have to work at it a little bit, but the gains are more assured than with btcjam or the like. It also requires a bit of additional fiat capital to rebuy coins before volatility eats away profits. \n\nTo illustrate: \n\nSet up a LocalBitcoins.com profile and post an add as a seller. Pick a payment method like Western union or Moneygram, whichever is more convenient for you. (WU buyers tend to pay a higher markup). Set your initial markup at about +6-7%. And sit tight, someone will open a trade eventually. Stay online/active (green dot showing).\n\nLet's use a market price of $225/BTC, and a markup of 7%. Which means your 1.5btc are listed for ~$357. \n\nLocalbitcoins will take 1% of the coins traded. So the most you can actually sell is 1.485btc.\n\nAt a 7% markup you should walk away from the trade with ~$357 cash. Assuming you can rebuy (or wait to rebuy, the price almost always goes back down a little bit) at least $350 worth of bitcoin while the price is $225 or less, you'll end that cycle with about 1.575btc and maybe a couple of $ in your pocket. Hopefully closer to 1.59. Do it again and you'll have ~1.65btc. Again for 1.736btc. 1.8232... 1.9144 .... 2.0101... And on and on. \n\nI've changed the numbers to reflect the additional 1% that will be spent on rebuying coins to continue the cycle. So a 7% markup is actually only increasing your USD holdings by 5%. And I'm assuming that you are putting your full USD holdings into each rebuy and resell. You could always shave off profits in one currency or another along the way. And there will be price movement that may eat into (or magnify) your btc gains throughout. \n\nGood luck. \n\nEdit: I lost track of the market price I started with halfway through the example.
