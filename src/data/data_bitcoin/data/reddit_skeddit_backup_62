Putting this in other words, this could be the ideal currency of "the dark side of the internet", a kind of tax haven for drug dealers, rapists or any criminal element.\n\n\n**Bitcoin in Venezuela:  A tool to evade taxes, launder money and damage the economy of the country.**\nIn Venezuela, there are groups dedicated to promote the use of Bitcoin, who don\'t doubt in qualify the use of this digital currency as having a subversive air to it.\n\n\nFor Venezuelans, it is not a secret the damage that it has caused to the economy that is it is being pushed and promoted via websites like Dollar Today. That it has got an illegal and criminal exchange rate that has caused a severe damage to the national economy, causing induced levels of inflation, which don\'t match to normal paramenters of economic development.\n\n\n\nRecently it could be known that many people have started to use Bitcoin as an alternative to evade the currency exchange policies emitted by the Bolivarian government to guarantee a correct development of the economy .\n\n\nWho regulates this currency? How does it fluctuate? Are questions that have found no answers.  What it is clear is that its use produces a negative effect to the national currency, to the use of legal commodities and to the productive growth of the economy.\n\n---\n': 43, 'So you actually believe that B.S.?

This is what users of OpenBazaar, a peer-to-peer digital mall that\xe2\x80\x99s just emerged after a lengthy gestation, will see as they peruse the various stores from the comfort of their desk.\n\nThough it\xe2\x80\x99s very early stages (OpenBazaar has only just opened a test service, with full launch expected later this month), the current app, running on Apple AAPL Mac in FORBES\xe2\x80\x99 test drive, is a far cry from what some hyperbolic commentators were expecting. When OpenBazaar\xe2\x80\x99s operators proposed the idea of a distributed marketplace where there was no central authority to hold to account, the currency was the untraceable (but actually very traceable) Bitcoin cryptocurrency and the rules almost non-existent, it led to assumptions OpenBazaar would house next -generation narcotics markets like Silk Road, illegal weapons stores and child abuse content dealers that police could never track.

Encryption in transit across the nodes used to host the network (see map below for the spread) helps prevent simple snooping, whilst the very nature of a peer-to-peer setup means the US government cannot target an authoritative, centralized body, whether with a subpoena or a technical taskforce looking to knock out a server. Bringing the network crumbling down, though not impossible as shown in police P2P botnet takedowns, will be considerably harder than if command and control of the network were hosted on a small number of boxes. The chat feature is also end-to-end encrypted, which should prove popular given the rise of such services in response to revelations of mass government surveillance.\n"\n\n*(Picture showing OB nodes globally in Google Maps)*\n\n*Quote for pic - "The global nodes that currently handle the peer-to-peer OpenBazaar network. The lack of centralized control makes it difficult for government to censor traders."*\n\n**Why it ain\xe2\x80\x99t Silk Road [insert iteration number here]**\n\n"\nBut there are a few key reasons OpenBazaar is unlikely to become the next Silk Road. First, IP addresses of users are viewable to those have the technical ability to look. If the user can pull data from the OpenBazaar API (the application programming interface that allows outside access to some OpenBazaar systems), it\xe2\x80\x99s possible to build a crawler that maps out all participants in the P2P network. Anyone who isn\xe2\x80\x99t routing their traffic through other servers and thereby masking their IP address (typically done over a Virtual Private Network or the Tor anonymizing network) can, therefore, be quickly identified and located if police have a warrant."\n\nThis is pointed out in a stark warning during registration: \xe2\x80\x9cOpenBazaar users are not anonymous by default. Most communications between parties are encrypted, but IP addresses are public and can be associated with activity on the network. Malicious parties could use this information against you; protecting your privacy is your own responsibility.\xe2\x80\x9d Even where users take extra precautions, governments have documented methods of exploiting VPNs and Tor.\n\nThen there\xe2\x80\x99s the ethos of OpenBazaar\xe2\x80\x99s chief purveyors: Brian Hoffman, a former lead associate for cybersecurity at Edward Snowden\xe2\x80\x99s old employer Booz Allen Hamilton , long-time Bitcoin specialist Sam Patterson and academic Dr. Washington Sanchez. After taking over the OpenBazaar project after a few emails from its original creator Amir Taaki, one of the first to promote and develop Bitcoin and the associated Dark Wallet, the trio sought to make a platform free of government control where companies could make more money by cutting out the middleman, typically the owner of the store like eBay or Amazon, who take a small percentage of each sale on their respective platforms. With Bitcoin, the middlemen, the banks and credit card companies who took a cut of traditional transactions, were already removed. But the platforms (yes, including those dark web drug and gun markets) still took their slice. With OpenBazaar, there\xe2\x80\x99s only the buyer and the seller.\n\nThe creation of the network will earn them nothing directly. Hence why they founded OB1, which is looking into numerous avenues to bring big names to OpenBazaar with which it will partner on certain stores. It\xe2\x80\x99ll also provide merchant support services, such as vetting legitimate businesses and arbitration, for which it may charge. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have a list of several hundred individuals and businesses who, over the past months, have asked to be notified when we go live. So we\xe2\x80\x99ll be starting with them and anyone else who wants to join,\xe2\x80\x9d says Patterson, talking to me over OpenBazaar\xe2\x80\x99s encrypted chat.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe won\xe2\x80\x99t be targeting big players immediately. Part of this is that we want to make sure the client and network have been well tested before we push for wider adoption. The other part is that the client currently doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have a lot of tools to do proper inventory management, something that will be necessary for anything larger than a small business.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe initial roll-out is still very much through an excited and engaged community and word of mouth, and we aren\xe2\x80\x99t going to be doing marketing until we\xe2\x80\x99re confident we\xe2\x80\x99ve really nailed down this new way of doing commerce online. Peer to peer commerce isn\xe2\x80\x99t going to take over the internet overnight, and we\xe2\x80\x99re in this for the long haul.\xe2\x80\x9d\n"\n\n**The beginnings of a retail revolution? Or more dark web drugs?**\n\n"\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s been an auspicious start for OpenBazaar. Since the test went live at the start of March, Hoffman tells me there have been roughly 15,000 downloads of the app for testing. Having acquired a small amount of funding in a $1 million seed round from Union Square Ventures, Andreessen Horowitz and angel investor William Mougayar, Hoffman says his company is focused on growing the site without any more outsider investment in the near future.\n\nOpenBazaar could still become attractive to those flogging illicit gear. Hoffman and his colleagues plan to increase security on the app, providing much more effective anonymization. They believe buyers and sellers have the right to keep their identity secret; understandable in light of global surveillance, where digital stores have been infiltrated by government spies, most notably attempts by the NSA on Google\xe2\x80\x99s Play store.\n\nMore privacy features are on the way too. In the coming months, as OpenBazaar tries to sell the idea of a new kind of retail to the average shopper, it\xe2\x80\x99ll look to tie itself to an anonymizing network, either Tor or the lesser-known i2p. The encrypted chat is currently not as private as, say, a Jabber client like Adium or Tor Messenger. OB1 developer Chris Pacia tells me all of OpenBazaar uses NaCl, a crypto library by Daniel Bernstein. He notes that further updates could provide more privacy. \xe2\x80\x9cThe encrypted chat is pretty basic at the moment. It\xe2\x80\x99s mostly just geared towards connecting two OpenBazaar nodes do they can discuss a purchase if needed. We don\xe2\x80\x99t make any explicit attempt to hide IP addresses, for example. More advanced functionality like that could be layered on later as needed,\xe2\x80\x9d he says.\n\nAt the time of writing, I could only find one dubious seller, who was offering NATO-grade pepperspray and a \xe2\x80\x9cflashlight stun gun\xe2\x80\x9d. One wonders whether he or she has a licence to sell those goods in America.\n"\n\n*(Picture of said flashlight stun gun and user selling it)*\n\n*Quote for pic - "One of a few items for sale on OpenBazaar that might raise eyebrows, due to the possible illegality of selling such a weapon. In its early days, OpenBazaar doesn\xe2\x80\x99t look like a haven for criminals."*\n\n"\nBut even if it does become a playground for criminals, to blame the OpenBazaar creators would miss the point. The OpenBazaar protocol, explains Hoffman, is \xe2\x80\x9cagnostic\xe2\x80\x9d. Like all code, it has no explicit moral bias. \xe2\x80\x9cThe distinction allows for sale and trade of goods legally in one jurisdiction that may actually be illegal in others but does not intentionally enable users to conduct illegal trade and encourage that,\xe2\x80\x9d Hoffman adds. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a tool, not a business.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nFor now drug, fraud and gun merchants will likely stick to Tor Hidden Services, where sites are hosted on the anonymizing network and can only be accessed when users \xe2\x80\x9chop\xe2\x80\x9d across randomly-selected servers to reach their destination. When OpenBazaar does get somewhat more secure, there\xe2\x80\x99s little reason to suspect dark web merchants will move over en masse as there\xe2\x80\x99s currently no indication it\xe2\x80\x99ll offer better protection from law enforcement, even if it\xe2\x80\x99ll be harder to take storefronts down.\n\nIf OpenBazaar can appeal to major merchants and independent retailers who want to save money and know how to handle Bitcoin, it has the chance to shake up the market in a significant way. The early adopters might be a little kooky (expect that anarchist aspect to remain), but that\xe2\x80\x99s no reason for big players not to try something different that could, in the long-term, save them considerable expense.\n\nTips and comments are welcome at TFox-Brewster@forbes.com or tbthomasbrewster@gmail.com for PGP mail.

PayPal offers a similarly convenient service. When combined this enables a simple online merchant to sell to tens if not hundreds of millions of people around the world...for a fee. The Cost of Doing Business. If you don\'t want to pay it your competitors happily will and they will eat your lunch as a result. This is the very root of why retailers accept credit cards in the first place, even with all the Bitcoin rhetoric about high fees and charge backs. \n\nNow, with OB, you might not have a fee but you also don\'t have any customers looking at your goods and an infinitely smaller base of potential customers based on the Bitcoin-only payments. When you compare the two, the "exorbitant fees" are the cost of enormous opportunity that doesn\'t exist with OB. You save yourself 3% or 5% or even 20% in fees but lose 99.99999% of prospective customers and suddenly the fees don\'t seem so exorbitant. \n\nPut simply, I\'d rather pay EBay and PayPal the fees they ask and have thousands of sales than make one or two no fee sales per month.

A patent, by contrast, refers to the legal ownership of a design or concept for a physical product. Since we're dealing with branding and promotion rather than manufacturing and products, domain name registrants such as bitgold should have no trouble showing that they were the established service provider prior to the usurper's claim on that trademark.": 4, 'what a c*nt.': 2, 'Guys, just put your "trademarks" on the blockchain, then you have proof of existence and ownership.': 2, 'plus you can only deposit btc to their dubai vault and not redeem gold if bought with btc making it non fungible\n': 2, 'bullies.
