Valuation != value. \n\ndisclaimer: I'm a long-winded idiot.\n\ndiatribe: Value is subjective. For example, my engineer has to take a pill every 4 hours to break down the adrenaline his body is over producing because of condition he is currently suffering or he will die. The pill costs 1.65/pill which is it's valuation, but the value is his life. That pill has no value to me other than it keeps my friend and colleague alive. I don't need to take it. I don't know of an opportunity where I can broker it for trade. If we stop using someone else's valuation and use our own value system for our needs and desires, things would change drastically. \n\nWith traditional fiat, and crypto, you have a few people hoarding the printers (miners). The bankers have a license to counterfeit and have the added bonus of influencing our valuation. So we are taxed with inflation and we are double taxed as we are devalued. With crypto, you have people hoarding the miners, extracting more than they produce in many cases, and speculating value. There is no value other than a bet in an exchange to attempt to extract perceived value from the other gamblers. What is the real value of bitcoin? X dollars? what is the value of those dollars? a triangulated value with other printed bullshit?  It's a race to the fucking bottom with countries devaluing their currency to gain trade...this seems stupid to me. \n\nI had this idea a while ago for a crypto coupon decentralized exchange, but considering the flaws in crypto I'm not sure I want to use blockchain tech for this any more. So let's just call it a coupon for now. I differentiate money from currency from coupons. This is my belief: Money is a tangible asset in trade for goods and service that we BELIEVE has value, like gold etc. Currency until bitcoin was a celebration of dead presidents, art printed by criminals, we BELIEVE has value. Coupons are a token in trade for a fixed value we know we're going to receive. like groupon. \n\nI can instantiate a coupon for any good or service I can deliver. So I create a block of jpastore coupons that can be traded for one hour of my time or a unit of my harvest, or unit of a product I make. You can buy these coupons from my exchange node with any of the other listed symbols I have a buy order in for. I planned on introducing a stablizer that employees something akin to triangulate arbitrage....look for what I want and try to find the cheapest deal for me...commodity+logistics. I need wheat, water, etc. I should be able to interface with my contacts exchange nodes and the public markets to try and determine the most efficient means to settle. This may require satisfying other people's needs, (automated collaboration), to ensure delivery of my needs at the lowest cost possible.\n\nI don't like a controlled centralized market that can be manipulated, like Best Buy's internal web page with fake data to support their prices or the bankers manipulating the LIBOR. Quite frankly every single person should be a middle man and direct producer without and special permission. If you have a reputation and there is 3rd party assurance we should be able to transact. There should be a double deposit system for trustless transactions, like that found in real estate. I think David Zimbeck brilliantly introduced into his Halo system for bitcoin and blackcoin. disclaimer: I briefly worked with him on this, and paths diverged shortly thereafter.\n\nThe gamble should only be an event of unplanned catastrophe such as a hurricane, earth quakes, or some highway robber/customs/tax man or other cartel trying to intervene until they are made irrelevant. \n\nSecurity for delivery should also be compensated for as a service, which could be argued to be the tax for protection we pay the mafia, I mean government.  In fact everyone can organize all services needed without centralized government. Property ownership is something I'm still working out. Like actual land and claim to it. \n\nThis is kind of a digression into another diatribe...if you're still reading...thank you. \n\nI have an idea on how to start the implementation of this with education. I envision a university owned as a co-op with the community that hosts it, the faculty, and students. Students can come together and create an actual business, product, or service. Your core idea producer can engineer a widget, or recruit an engineer to design the widget. Their respective professors can take a stake in the project and collaborate with other departments to try and actually launch it. I think this bridges a gap between academia and enterprise. This needs work for the research sectors of academia.  I think parents should instantiate a wallet/contract with their children, their teachers should have a stake in the children. Long term low yield contracts for the elementary teachers, slightly higher stake for middle school, even higher for the high school. The university is honing the foundational skills and deploying a functional person or group. Everyone has a stake in the future success of the children. The contract would expire after a maturation period. People should not be a slave to society, but society should recoup the something from your success. In my opinion this differs from socialism as it is not compelled, and people are incentivized to collaborate instead of compete. If we collaborate to keep costs down we won't have hoarding psychopaths convincing us that we need to give them our wealth for the artificial restriction they created and bully us with. The idea is to grow independent self sufficient micro economies with need for a king/central authority which is invariably the problem.\n\nI tried to keep this short and simple. sorry. I think there is much more to describe but I already dragged you down a rabbit hole and I'm surprised if you made it this far. \n": 1, 'This is interesting?\rWill banks be able to lend out more than the 20m that exist?': 1, 'Yes they can.\nBitcoin credit will be established dont worry.': 5, "What do you plan on investmenting in then?

Same reason why gold backed currency is currently not preferred being that when banks screw up bank runs become real because there is no way to bail them out.  Likewise when a government screws up no one can bail it out with gold. However if you effectively print your own money you just inflate out of the problem. This is probably a big part of why housing bubbles seem so common now days as they are so closely tied to lending and the ability to print means you can just keep inflating. At least to me it is a fairly obvious wealth transfer mechanism and a big part of the growth in finance. Also fairly obvious why governments like it. Also why people criticize the Euro as now sovereign governments like Greece can\'t inflate their way out of problems.(personally I think the inflating out is not really a good solution but that\'s another story)\n\nI find this interesting because bitcoin has many similarities with gold but a few key differences.  This may be why some consider it a commodity. The way i see it gold is relatively scarce as is bitcoin. However its not very practical to use gold for general transactions (which resulted in the pound note and hence money backed by gold) but bitcoin is a bit different in that it might be possible to make it practical for transactions. I would say it is not yet practical but as software and hardware evolves that may change. To me the most important difference between bitcoin and gold is that block chain being open. That means if a bank does lend out bitcoin, it should be possible to audit them. Everyone should be able to tell when a bank has lent out 97% of its reserves in the same way banks now lend out currency.  It takes away that trust from the bank, and makes it obvious that the reason "bank x" is being so profitable is just because they have lent out 99% of their reserves and are just trading profit for risk.': 7}, ('What do you wish for Bitcoin in 2016?', 17): {'If price surge by +5000%, I can afford to go.': 8, 'No but he shits in the woods': 1, '(very quickly pardon my Denglish) It would mean that you can fully verify all transactions and help send (pruned and non pruned) blocks and new transactions not yet in a block around the world but you would only store full blocks that are less than a year old and prune (reduce) older blocks.

I guess I'm wondering, do you know what portion of pools actually hold their bitcoins rather than selling them, and what portion sells for fiat fairly quickly? As I said, BitFury recently indicated they hold all their bitcoins, as they have $20 million in fiat for operational purposes. -- I ask, in terms of: what do you think about my stated concern over Ant's rapidly increasing hashrate in recent weeks? Seems like going from ~20% to ~28%.\n\nIs there incentive to constrain hashrate to something more alluring to outsiders, such as 20% or 15% or 10% (ideally!), with the idea that it would be a marketing point that the network is 'very decentralized' instead of 'fairly centralized'? Can there be coordination and discussion among major miners to jointly agree to something like that, such as keeping hashrate as low as possible (e.g. 15% each, or less)?\n\nCan you think of any other incentives that would be helpful, from your vantage point?\n\nAt the end of the day, I think the more highly decentralized the hashrate, the more resilient the network will be, which means price will be higher... since value proposition of the network will be higher, and it can be used for more purposes.\n\nAnother thing I've been wondering about: Is there even a remote possibility that the Chinese government (which is fairly authoritarian) would decide to nationalize the mining hashrate within China, in the near-future or medium-term, supposing Bitcoin price explodes 10-100-1000x? Isn't it an additional reason to restrict hashrate from centralizing in any particular region? Or are there safeguards possible to prevent such a scenario?\n\nThese are difficult questions, but the sooner they can be answered (and the network 'fixed' to make it more decentralized and resilient), the better it will be for every participant (primarily via the mechanism of a higher price, which should easily offset any decreased portion of the hashrate). Imagine a truly censorship-resistant network, which means people can store their wealth as an off-shore tax haven, without any threat from gov. or regulatioin? The possibilities are mind-boggling. Price could increase by many multiples, if the network was extremely resilient, I would imagine. So, the tradeoff would seem to be worth it (less hashrate %, but much higher price/BTC).\n\nI think Satoshi designed Bitcoin's mining incentives to imagine a competitive environment, but if, with the above understanding, Bitcoin's major mining players (including future entrants like 21, with its ambitious plans) collaborated to actively decentralize the network as much as possible, then it may be a win-win-win (miners, price, users).\n\nThanks!": 2, "Precisely!

I was thinking the same things a few hours ago. I remembered reading your statement that it historically takes ~3 months on average for new soft fork to be adopted, but then realized the current 35% adoption is mostly of smaller pools (plus the always quick to the take, F2pool). Bitcoin's mining centralization then means we can jump from 35% to the finish line, relatively quickly!\n\nAh, mining centralization is bittersweet.\n\nI'm very concerned about AntPool, though. They have increased their share of hashrate at least 50% in a very short period of time. I hope they are aware of the implications, and that a more decentralized mining network is actually in their interest (since it equates to perceived more secure network, which means price will likely be higher, which means they can still earn more $ even without increasing their hashrate -- although they'd earn less bitcoins, and so if they're holding their bitcoins like BitFury is, in anticipation of future price rises, then the argument becomes weaker).": 2, "Bleep bleep...

But I have some now (about 0.8 Bitcoin or roughly $282~ish US Dollars). I try not to view it as an investment. In a perfect world.. I\'d like to have around US $1000 in Bitcoin.. so that if it does every shoot up (lets say: 10x value).. I most certainly would cash-out and pay off some debt/bills/etc. I don\'t think it\'s going to spike that high/that fast.. so as it stands, I\'m content to hold onto what I have in Bitcoin now.. and contribute a little more into it each month.

It'll tell you a lot about how much belief you have in it going mainstream. \n\nI am aware that a complete collapse is a possibility, but I'm not worried as such.

It\'s now sitting around $350 or so ... \n\nIf it ever dives down to $100 or under.. I\'ll probably buy a lot. If it continues to slowly/steadily climb.. I\'ll probably continue buying in $100 or $200 increments each month and slowly build my Bitcoin wallet. \n\nI\'d love (at some point) to be able to go about my daily routine just using Bitcoins.... not sure if that will happen any time soon (Unless I buy the Coinbase "Swift" card)...

Personally, I don\'t think it\'s realistic that the price could collapse overnight, and it makes sense to me that that Bitcoin will only become more valuable over time. At the moment (in Nov 2015) it\'s very much a speculative bubble, but the potential is there for it to be more useful and thus more inherently valuable in the future. The biggest impediment I see to Bitcoin right now is the gray-zone regulations which make people wonder if it\'s even legal, and the Bitcoin community\'s penchant for paranoid conspiracy theorizing. Once it\'s ease of use is better understood I think people will appreciate what it can do, and by virtue of being the best-branded and original cryptocurrency, it\'ll be the one with the best value. Myself, I figured I should buy what I can now so I\'m not kicking myself in the 2030s for not getting some when it was still affordable.': 3, "When people answer poorly it is probably because they are frustrated at their lack of knowledge too, and are blindly hoping.\n\nI'd agree that there is about a 50/50 chance of it going up/down, but the potential rewards of the 'up' far outweigh the risks of 'down'. Imagine if bitcoin gets adopted by more prominent online retailers, and more physical stores start accepting the new credit cards/debit cards (or whatever they are being called) that were launched not long ago. There are also things like the Trezor that are helping less technically sound users secure their funds...\n\nIf everything falls 'our' way, we will become very rich. But in saying that, governments will likely adopt blockchain technology and maybe bitcoin will become redundant... It is hard to tell. If we lose our money, at least we learnt a lot about economics in the meantime.\n\nI would recommend investing in bitcoin, as the more users we have the better it is (lol). Don't just invest that amount in one go though, you should probably incrementally invest. Like, the price has gone a bit nuts today, but two weeks ago some people were saying bitcoin would be dead due to the EU... \n\nThe other thing to weigh up is whether your investment is worth the opportunity cost. With that money would you be better off getting gold? Or perhaps would you like to buy and sell things with bitcoin as well as treating it as an investment. Thats what makes it interesting, it isn't gold, but it doesn't truly behave like a currency either due to investors having 5+ years in mind. \n\nFurthermore, we will often be subject to bigger players f***ing with things.

Given how I predict the future, I think Crypto currency will be important in 20 years time, and I would suggest Bitcoin is best placed to capitalise on that. \n\nI'm also given heart by the fact that it seems Bitcoin has survived crashes, If it's issue is fragility to a complete collapse, It seems to be able to weather that, the question is can it maintain rough stability for a couple of years...\n\nIt seems to me the likely hood is that it can, it's big enough now that its collapse would be phased, Investors would get a chance to respond albeit a shorter less predictable window than most trading options.\n\nIt would seem likely that say \xc2\xa31000 over 2 years would be a profitable investment so long as you keep an eye on the information coming in and get out if it looks like it might crash. \n\nI wouldn't expect to lose much, but the profit potential seems pretty good to me ( but I know sod all about this stuff )\n": 1, 'One of my concerns is the blockchain being the revolutionary aspect and it being copied and pasted by banks/governments, rather than all of my bitcoin being worth tons.': 1, "I want to frame this conversation.

Not sure why.': 1, "The Big Short by Michael Lewis truly brings the reader Inside of the Doomsday Machine. It reads like a fictional drama novel consisting of a main conflict so heinous, it\xe2\x80\x99s seemingly untrue. But this story is not of fiction. Lewis provides real, first hand accounts detailing the outrageous ignorance that led to the worldwide economic meltdown of 2007; While simultaneously exposing the structural flaws of the financial system that brought forth this catastrophe. Lewis provides sufficient evidence that the system is in dire need of being updated. Otherwise, we will all pay for the mistakes of the few...again.\n\nMichael Lewis spends a great deal of time describing the savages who built the nuclear bomb that was Sub-Prime Mortgage Backed Securities. While also in-depthly following the brave men and woman who eventually set off this trillion dollar bomb(Lewis 225). Michael Lewis, himself, was inside the cold heart of this machine in the 1980\xe2\x80\x99s. He promptly left after he made some money and realized how totally preposterous this system really is. \xe2\x80\x9cSooner rather than later,\xe2\x80\x9d Lewis then thought, \xe2\x80\x9cSomeone is going to identify me, along with a lot of people more or less like me, as a fraud. Sooner rather than later would come a Great Reckoning\xe2\x80\x9d(Lewis Prologue). This Great Reckoning didn\xe2\x80\x99t come for two more decades. In that time, it grew to proportions larger than anyone, including Lewis, could have foreseen. It required a few very unique individuals that were able to recognize the problem, and more importantly, stand up against it. While everyone else was profiting and praising the market, individuals like Michael Burry risked it all and bet against the trend. Dr. Michael Burry suffered from Asperger\xe2\x80\x99s Syndrome which made it trouble for him to fit in socially. He preferred to stay home alone reading prospectuses or rebuilding his computer. Some would refer to his syndrome as a disability, but Burry felt that financial markets were an ideal route for someone like him to excel in. He obsessed over obtaining cold hard facts. \xe2\x80\x9cOnly someone with Asperger\xe2\x80\x99s would read a subprime mortgage bond prospectus,\xe2\x80\x9d said Burry. And it was true. Instead of reading the actual content and evaluating the real risks for themselves, the majority of players relied solely on third parties; Whether it was a big rating agencies or their genius buddy who invented the thing. They were all wrong. Just as Lewis bluntly mentions in the Prologue, very large sums of money were given to naive young who men gambled and lost. \xe2\x80\x9cOne trillion dollars in losses had been created by American financiers, out of whole cloth, and embedded in the American financial system.\xe2\x80\x9d(Lewis 225) And we are left to pay. Through indirect and seemingly invisible ties, our financial system enabled the wealthy Wall Street bankers to pass on their losses to the US taxpayer. Even after the fact, the citizens of America have continued to put their trust in these institutions despite the havoc that they wreak on our society. Lewis succinctly sums up the issue, \xe2\x80\x9cThe people in position to resolve the financial crisis, were, of course, the very same people who had failed to see it...They had proven far less capable of grasping basic truths in the heart of the U.S. financial system than a one-eyed money manager with Asperger\xe2\x80\x99s syndrome.\xe2\x80\x9d(260) If our nation is to sustain and prosper, we must radically restructure our financial system. We cannot continue to put our trust, money, and livelihood in the hands of the irresponsible.\n\nOne underlying issue with modern finances is the need for trust.  In today\xe2\x80\x99s finance, it is impossible to interact without trust. You must trust that your bank will have your funds when you want them. Which wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the case in the Greece recently. And even cash requires trust. When a US Dollar is transacted, both parties must trust that the United States government is backing that piece of cloth. While it seems like such an obvious fact, most people do not realize how heavily they are relying on these agencies.  When buyers of subprime mortgage bonds trusted that the major ratings agencies accurately assessed them, the atom had split. A nuclear chain reaction of devastatingly poor financial decisions had begun. During this time, middle-men like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were generating significantly increased profits from all the action, so they neglected reality. Why wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t they? They were making enormous returns, and their risk was \xe2\x80\x9cbacked\xe2\x80\x9d by the government. \xe2\x80\x9cThe problem was the system of incentives that channeled greed\xe2\x80\x9d(Lewis 257). The capital management entities had no incentive to play fair. So they didn\xe2\x80\x99t. And when they were caught cheating, most were given what can only be described as a slap on the wrist, followed by a pat on the butt ushering them to, \xe2\x80\x9cGet back out there and try again, kid!\xe2\x80\x9d The individuals who allowed this debacle to ensue, are the same individuals who continue to run the show. There was no foundational upheaval in the system. The average citizen was too busy scavenging their scraps that they had neglected to truly assess the real issue at hand. We continue to use this same system, with the same management. If the free market truly exists anymore, then it will mandate that our system be replaced with an efficient and modern alternative. \n\nWe are all operating in a systematically broken and outdated financial system. A system that was designed for a different socioeconomic time. It worked fairly well for quite a while. But now our world is advancing faster than ever. Entirely new obstacles face us on the horizon. These obstacles will require entirely new systems to be met with. When faced with these issues, one may turn to government, or some other central agency for answers. Most are unsure of how to deal with an issue themselves, so the issues of many are pseudo-solved by the very few. The very few who likely don\xe2\x80\x99t even share the same dilemma. Resulting in the majority fighting an uphill battle, blind to the nature of their own struggle. This is the type of behavior that modern government promotes. By attempting to serve the endless needs of millions, they are actually inhibiting the individual's essential need to think for themselves.  These agencies pretend to be the host of our society, when they are in fact the leech. The true host is the network of individuals that we call average citizens. Yet the people can not even begin to comprehend the extent of their own power because it has been purposely obfuscated.  Nobody fixed the system because nobody understood the system. The shenanigans that occurred in our system were so confusing and complex that it required an award winning author to write an entire novel dedicated to shedding light on it\xe2\x80\x99s failure.": 8, 'The financial system is corrupt from its core, just watch the documentary "Inside Job".': 5, 'This time we write the truth of history in the blockchain so nobody will be able to alter it!': 5, "Don't be silly.\n\nThey were dragons.": 3, "Looks good, I'll get a sample and maybe buy it": 1, 'Well, if nothing else, it drives more people to BTC.
