This has resulted in a huge imbalance, of the order of 500 *billion* euros.\n\n4) If Greece chooses to default after the elections, lots of German banks are going to be royally screwed, since the IOUs they have accumulated will turn to dust overnight. It's a staring contest, really. By threatening to default, Greece can exercise pressure on the stronger EU countries. But the stronger EU countries can exercise pressure on Greece, too, by threatening to call the bluff and cut the flow of capital. It's a speculation of who will blink first.\n\n5) If Greece does choose to default, the ECB will have absolutely no other option but to cut the capital flows to Greece - regardless of the consequences for the rest of the EU. However, while this will cause significant distress in the rest of the EU, it absolutely, most definitely, will make the Greek banks insolvent overnight.\n\n6) The only option Greece will have in such a situation will be to leave the euro, no matter whether it wants or not, replace the bank holdings with new local currency and devalue that currency.\n\nNow, while all this will have very grave consequences for everyone involved (Greece, the rest of the EU, and the rest of the world), it is extremely unlikely to happen. It is just not impossible to happen, which is why I said that the possibility exists.\n\nI am very aware that the vast majority (83% is the poll results I've seen) of Greeks want to keep the euro as their currency. They just don't like the EU governments telling them what to do. To be honest, much of what the troika has been telling them to do is economically disastrous idiocy dreamed up by bureaucrats without a clue. However, when you are broke (and Greece *is*), you have no choice but to do what your creditor demands - or default.\n\nSYRIZA and its chief demagogue are just politicians who have seen the opportunity to grab some power. Like most politicians, they care only about power and are economic ignoramuses. Which is why Tsirpas says one day that Greece will terminate the bailout (and the requirements imposed with it) and threatens to leave the EU (because the Greeks hate the EU and the restrictions imposed by it) and the other day he says that Greece will not leave the euro (because the Greeks vividly remember how bad it was when the drachma was devalued at will and want to keep the euro as their currency). In other words, he says what he thinks his constituency wants to hear. Which is why I said that the SYRIZA guys are liars (like almost all politicians).\n\nHowever, they are probably not complete idiots. Which is why I think that no matter what they are saying now, they will probably not default once they manage to win the elections. Still, with politicians, one never knows for sure.\n\nAnyway. My point was that *if* Greece defaults (very unlikely), it will have to leave the euro (no matter of whether it wants or not) and introduce a local currency, capital controls and other unpleasantness. Very, very unlikely to happen - but possible. Now, *if* that happens, some people here are speculating wildly that the Greeks will rush to buy bitcoins, in order to be able to preserve their savings (from being converted to new drachmas and devaluated into oblivion) and to transfer them abroad (to an euro account) despite the capital controls. And I was expressing my opinion that this is an idiotic, wild speculation, because even if this unlikely event happens, Bitcoin isn't going to let them bypass the capital controls, as I cannot bypass the capital controls of Iceland (not legally, anyway).": 2, 'Because it lost 80% in the last year.

Current silicon-based chips are limited by heat generation, and fail at parallel tasks due to poor data management(as multi core cpus technically operate in serial, and communicate with each core). Optical computing operates true parallel on a hardware level. Optical computers are limited only by the speed of light, and how small you can make the grids that light shines through.\n\nAs Moore\'s law reaches its limits with silicon, optical computing will provide a new way to reach more power efficient and high power computing solutions at affordable costs.

The "bank" wallet should have a configurable daily withdrawal limit, and perhaps other fund access limitations as well, enforced by the blockchain. Limitations to access to the "bank" wallets\' funds can only be lifted by using a separate seed that is stored offline. This "override seed" should be derived from the master seed.\n\nThe effect of this standardization will be that almost everyone will be using this same safe setup.

They don\'t need to work together to do that.\n\nThe workings of a one-to-one channel are clear and secure. The workings of a multi-hop depend on a recipient to send the money on. My model though closes the loop in that the wallets talk to each other either end-to-end encrypted via the route or via a side channel and the wallets can work in increments, so that never more money is at risk than the processors are trusted with. Those processors do have a reputation and can charge for their service. A new processor would get high scrutiny. Maybe no client would want to trust it, as spawning millions of "free" hubs could be the next scam model, where the hubs all pull the plug all at once and the money in limbo is gone but with the right incentives, this is very unlikely to happen. Companies like bitpay and coinbase would certainly run hubs for their customers and would be trusted by them but also anonymous hubs could easily exist. They could do a proof of burn over $100 in order to get trusted for 100ms over $0.1. Boom, a new hub is born. It takes 0.1% for its service and if it would hold $100 at some point, then either some person trusted it with way too much money, or it was processing more than 1000 transactions in parallel (not necessarily 1000 transaction per millisecond, as it could grab the first increments of all transactions until word has gotten arround that the gateway is corrupt, but still, with people risking $0.1 at a time, even with 10000 clients being scammed, running the server and the proof of burn and stuff would be worth more than that.). On the up-side the service that manages to have 1000 transactions per \xe2\x80\xa6 lets say hour, could already see a profit, as it should be free of maintenance. Sure, server security would be an issue, as the outgoing channels would be holding a lot of money but that would be the hub\'s money and not the money of people using the hub.\n\n> https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/2sr0ud/instant_confirmations_with_the_security_of_the/cnst22e\n\nIf I understand that right, you agree with me on the double-spending issue in the impulse.is proposal.': 1, "There are severe limitations to micropayment channels, at least when you compare what people want to do with them to what they are actually capable of doing.\n\nLots of schemes sound good on paper, but aren't very practical.\n\nCommon pitfalls include:\n\n* Situations may arise where one party can steal funds that don't belong to them anymore.\n* Some of the things you may want to do will only work if a large number of entities are online and contactable at the same time.\n* Certain arrangements can result in unexpected and non-intuitive limits on receiving and/or sending funds.\n* Some methods of avoiding the previous pitfalls may require somebody to lock up large amounts of idle capital, up to and and maybe even exceeding the total amounts being transacted.": 4, "Payment channels are like shared accounts. You put in $100 and only if the other party signs to return the full $100, you actually sign your part to charge the account, as now all that's missing to get the money back is your signature.\n\nNext you work with priorities. The first transaction that gives you back all the money has priority 1.\n\nNow the other party might say: Lets split the money $99/$1 with priority 2 (signed by other party). If you sign that, too, you would only get back $99 and the other party would get $1.\n\nThe whole shared account would have a life time during which you wouldn't be able to actually spend the money but holding the contract signed by the other is as good as owning the money as in case of both publishing their version of the contract, the higher priority would win.\n\nThis scheme can be chained. It can be executed very quickly. These are the building blocks of the OP.": 2, "Hi /u/justusranvier\n\nyou are definitely one of those guys that have the necessary understanding to comment on my proposal.\n\nI guess I covered the pitfalls. You don't elaborate on details but let me comment on each of them:\n\n* In my scheme, the possibility of entities trying to publish transactions that are not of the highest priority is addressed in the last part. Publishing those high priority transactions to servers that will broadcast them at the right time should not bring much negative implications with it. One thing is that the channel provides privacy in that all the tiny transactions that are not published would provide privacy that gets lost if you suddenly share them with many servers again but that's optional and you could run your own server for that.\n* Please elaborate. My scheme assumes that the recipient also does use payment channels and that the recipient is online but it also covers where you just pay to the bank of the recipient. I could live with google holding my coins while I'm offline, as long as I can get them instantly and out of google's control when I come online.\n* The constraints you are talking about is the hardest selling point for channels. People would have to lock up funds without the intention to send them now. This would drive people to believe that those funds would be out of their control but I guess that is a subject for education. The fact that the intermediary would independently also need huge funds, is addressed in the OP via the lenders (C).\n* see the prior point.\n\n\n\n\n": 2, "So if I understand correctly:\n\n- Currently D prays that A doesn't do a double spend\n\n- With Impulse proposal, D hopes A and B don't work together to trick him/her\n\n- With you proposal, D hopes that A+B1+B2...+BN don't work together to trick him/her\n\nHere is another proposal to pay without trust and without introducing more intermediaries (and fees): \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/2sr0ud/instant_confirmations_with_the_security_of_the/cnst22e\n\nBasically, B has to put a collateral for the transaction.": 7, ':) looking forward to your feedback then.': 1, "I was writing about payment channels in general.\n\nI'll need to spend some more time thinking about your proposal specifically.": 3, 'This is confusing as hell to me.

So the cost basis is $200 on that day, which you'll need to know when you come to sell/spend that Bitcoin.\n\nBut tomorrow, the price might be $220, so you only get 0.909 BTC but you still need to mark that 0.909 having a cost basis of $200.\n": 1, "1. You should set your rates in whatever fiat currency you use, and convert that into BTC using the exchange rate at the time. If you want to simplify the process and avoid the volatility completely, then you can accept payment through third-parties like BitPay and Coinbase who can instantly convert all payments into your currency, and transfer it to your bank account every day. Also, you can choose to keep a percentage of your income as bitcoin (e.g. 80% fiat, 20% bitcoin) instead of converting all of it.  \n2. You can offer discounts or extras, for example.

The other one was trading large quantities of bitcoin to reduce the price artificially.\n\nIn April 2013 they were responsible for bitcoin's biggest price spike. They certainly have enough bitcoin to massively distort the market.\n\nUnfortunately, their ETF is uninsureable, people want the keys themselves, so the ETF will trade at a discount to its underlying bitcoin.\n\nI wonder if they're going to acquire 51% personally, as cheaply as possible, then take the bitcoins out of the ETF wrapper?\n\nOr theyve shorted bitcoin?
