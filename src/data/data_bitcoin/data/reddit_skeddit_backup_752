People often keep dummy cell phones/wallets in the car knowing they\'ll get robbed.\n\nThat said, almost everyone and their mother has a smart phone in Pakistan, and Android phones are a dime a dozen. The urban elite have both iPhones and Android based phones. Even working class folks (drivers, day laborers etc) have some phone running Android.\n\nIf there was ever a country that has a dire need for btc as remittance/money transferring - Pakistan would be a prime example. The thieves would not hold a gun to your head and demand your private keys or Electrum seed.

The only issue is that electricity suffers from rolling blackouts (aka "loadshedding") in swaths of the country.

If you found someone else's secret number (private key) by force or fraud, it would be the force or fraud that would be immoral.\n\nIf your neighbor broadcasts their secret numbers (private keys) accidentally, you would be a good neighbor to help them out, but to say that their bitcoin was stolen is a bit like saying that if a power line falls on a stump that you happened to want removed, that you've stolen electricity from the power company.\n\nAgain, bitcoin has no concept of ownership, only control, but this doesn't negate the requirement for us all to be good neighbors.": 0, 'I am the OP of linked thread (The guy who found the laptop).  I spoke to a lawyer last week about the incident and feel like i can offer some legal prospective. A few points:\n\n(1) Digital goods and physical goods are treated very differently. Analogies like "Well if i find your keys, do i own your car?" are irrelevant. Access is clearly different than ownership.\n\n(2) The analogy, "well if i find your bank account password do i own the money in your bank account?" is also a poor analogy.  The issue here is legally know as the "expectation of privacy"  You have a password in the first place to prevent unauthorized access.  Therefore any authorized access is a violation of that expectation.  And again, access does not equate to ownership.\n\n(3) The fact that the private keys were unencrypted nor password protected is important.  If i would have "hacked" protected information then I likely would have committed a crime\n\nThe case with possessing a private key is obviously much more complicated. Its probably the case that bitcoin will be treated more like "cash" than like a bank account in the eyes of the law due to this expectation of privacy and ownership.\n\nTherefore here are a few scenarios that might be similar:\n-Finding a sack of money in someones garbage\n-Finding out a painting you purchased for a few dollars if worth a fortune\n-Finding some gold coins hidden away in a desk you purchased.\n\nBasically, because I acted in good faith as a buyer (i didnt know the bitcoins were on the computer) and the seller made no effort to secure the bitcoins, I have most likely not done anything illegal.  I am also under go obligation to return or compensate the seller.\n\nIf i did something unethical or not is for all you to decide.\n\nWhile we are on the subject of ethics, its interesting to note that I have received several dozen messages from people claiming that the laptop was theirs.

(The word *ownership* is somewhat ambiguous, and should be avoided in this sort of discussion.)\n\nIf a thief steals you car, he will get possession of it, but the car will still be your property.\n\nKnowledge of the key of an address gives possession, but does not establish property.  If two people know the key, both have possession, and either one can move the coins to another address.  \n\nProperty is a right; and the only meaningful definition of a right is "what the laws of the land say that the state will let you do, and will use its power to stop anyone who tries to prevents you from doing."  So you are the proprietor  of your car because the state lets you use it, and will send the police to find it and retrieve it if someone steals it from you.  (If the car is lost, the law may instead seize money or other asset from the thief to repair your loss.)\n\nThe US government recognizes that bitcoins can be property; so, If someone steals your bitcoins, in theory you could call the police to find the thief and take the bitcoins from him (or equivalent money). \n\nHowever, there are practial difficulties. To exercise your right -- that is, to call the cops in case of theft -- you must prove that you are the proprietor of the stolen thing, and that it was taken without your consent.\n\nIn the case of a car, there are many documents and government records that prove that the car was your property at some point; and the absence of such documents and records with a later date is accepted as proof that it did not become property of the thief -- that is, you did not sell of donate the car to him.\n\nEven for cash, if you can show bank withdrawal slips for 100\'000$, and if the thief cannot do the same for 80\'000$ found in his possession, the judge may assume that he stole it from you. Or you may have witneses of him taking the cash from your car, etc.. \n\nOn the other hand, you may not have any receipts or records in your name that prove that the bitcoins that were yesterday at address 1xyz... were your property; and the thief who copied your private key may have left no trace of his deed. You could not evenprove to the police that the address 1uvw..., where they are now, is not under your control.\n\nSo, in theory, stealing bitcoins is not different than stealing a car; but in practice it may be very difficult to enforce the property of bitcoins.': 5, "The problem is that there is no reliable way to verify an owner in such an instance.

If you see someone leaving their money unsecured, tell them!

': 6, 'If you think that Bitcoin is a Ponzi scheme, you don\'t know the definition of a Ponzi scheme, don\'t understand how Bitcoin works, or both. A Ponzi scheme is "a form of fraud in which belief in the success of a nonexistent enterprise is fostered by the payment of quick returns to the first investors from money invested by later investors." It is painfully, blindingly obvious that Bitcoin is not a Ponzi scheme. \n\nBitcoin is also obviously not a "pyramid scheme." \n> In a pyramid scheme, an organization compels individuals to make a payment and join. In exchange, the organization promises its new members a share of the money taken from every additional member that they recruit. The directors of the organization (those at the top of the pyramid) also receive a share of these payments.\n\nThere is no Bitcoin "organization," no "directors," no need for you to recruit people beneath you in order to enjoy the benefits of Bitcoin. Bitcoin is just a commodity whose price, like that of any other commodity, is determined by the law of supply and demand.\n\nMost people who level the Ponzi or pyramid scheme charge against Bitcoin are really attempting--inelegantly--to make the argument that Bitcoin is a "speculative bubble" (or "tulip mania") that requires an endless stream of "greater fools" to avoid collapse. That argument goes something like this: "why do people buy bitcoins? Because they hope to sell them in the future to other people for more money. But why do *those people* buy bitcoins? For the same reason. That\'s obviously unsustainable so the whole thing will come crashing down at some point." Here\'s what these people don\'t get. In a sense, *all* money relies on there being a "roughly equal or greater fool." In other words, the only reason anyone ever trades real value for little green pieces of paper or an electronic ledger entry is because they hope to, at some point in the future, exchange that money for something they really want, i.e. a good or service that can directly satisfy their wants or needs. But really, there\'s nothing "foolish" about money. It\'s a very useful accounting system for keeping track of value given but not yet received. Where the "digital tulips" crowd gets hung up is on the fact that *today\'s* holders of Bitcoin expect it to significantly increase in value, observing that such a thing can\'t continue forever. And that\'s true, but it doesn\'t have to. Bitcoin isn\'t a scheme that will collapse without endless exponential growth. Again, it\'s just a commodity. Its price can go up, down, or sideways (as the past five years have proven in sometimes dramatic fashion). Also, if Bitcoin achieves success as a gold alternative or even, as a true currency, people will trade real value for Bitcoin with the simple expectation that Bitcoin will *hold* its value (or increase in value relatively slowly at a rate commensurate with the growth of the overall economy).\n\nEdit: people sometimes try to rebut the "tulip" argument by claiming that *they\'re* not hoping to sell their bitcoins for more fiat in the future, because they plan to "spend" them. That misses the point.  They\'re still holding bitcoin because they hope to exchange it for real value in the future (again, the same reason anyone holds any form of money). Whether they access that stored value by trading those bitcoins directly for goods and services or by going through the intermediate step of first trading them for fiat is really immaterial.\n\nEdit2: Wow, thanks for all the tips, guys!

The main value of Bitcoin may, in \nretrospect, turn out to be the lessons it offers to central banks on the prospects of \nelectronic currency, and on how to enhance efficiency and cut transactions cost.\n\nSource:\n\nhttp://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2014/07/16/000112742_20140716115536/Rendered/PDF/WPS6967.pdf': 12, 'The phrase "accidental Ponzi scheme" makes as much sense as saying that a fatal disease is an "accidental murder".': 2, 'How is that the main  reason for anyone that isnt a libertarian?\n\nI cant recall the last time someone said "oh man, i hate having to use cash, it\'s censoring my true motives" (i had to write that several times because everything didnt even sound natural).\n\nA pretty good percentage of people dont give a shit about central banks or being "censored" (whatever that\'s supposed to mean). but lower the costs for something and suddenly you got their attention.': 2, '> "let\'s all throw our money on a pile in the middle of the room" until someone gets tempted and dives head first into the pile and kills the party.\n\nThis sounds like Quantitative Easing, Social Security, or Amazon stock.\n\nBut I still think you\'re fun :-)\n\n1 beer /u/changetip private': 0, '[Fucking ponzi schemes](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/nZTWldIOAqgh8zoKYotjUBLEnIfFW7pdkrv2kh1cl_wB3chCjJMhaFwG4MEIKSaxKNWPOTs8EXB_F4uTj52VEclmNvZqH9kfKLWKvJEX-ipgweAjAcniMWaY0xrXKzJf6pO8TA5-aHNgR9gjBNeFosgeJk5AY9Kral96=w278-h241-nc)': 2, '/u/changetip 15 mbtc': 4, 'So when all of my fellow holders decide to jump to another currency, without notifying me, you are concerned I will be left holding the bag?
