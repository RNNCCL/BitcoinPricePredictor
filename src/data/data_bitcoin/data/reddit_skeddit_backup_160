How do you think you verify a transaction? By cryptographically signing it. \n\nWith the same mechanism you can also encrypt messages. Every Bitcoin address is a public key with which you can encrypt a message which is only decryptable by the owner of that Bitcoin address.\n\nIf they 'ban' encryption (LOL, good luck) they effectively ban Bitcoin.": 0, "There is a middle ground. Encryption which we understand well enough that it can be broken when there is significant reason to break it, and that we modify to be in line with advances in processing and cryptanalysis, so that data stays secure while it needs to be secure (say 30 days, less for financial transactions) but can be broken by a nation State actor when it needs to, has a warrant, etc... It wouldn't really even require a Manhattan Project level commitment.": -1, 'Nope. A secure message used for e-commerce need not be secure for "forever." Only for say, the 30 seconds used to complete a transaction\xe2\x80\x94 especially when combined with blockchain / ledger technology. Now there are issues with man in the middle attacks to public/private key encryption systems, though this doesn\'t apply to symmetric encryption, but that\'s also why I don\'t have a problem with the signature generation using strong encryption. It gets around a lot of problems by having some very limited undecipherable transactions which allow for the continued functioning of the internet, without requiring every transaction be strongly encrypted.\n\nBasically, the point is that any information that\'s more than say 30 days old is more or less irrelevant at that point, or can be reasonably transmitted through different means than the internet.\n\nIt also might introduce some latency\xe2\x80\x94 which encourages the use of transparent communication when privacy isn\'t necessary, incentivizing systems like Facebook and Google to transmit in the clear to get the huge amounts of packets they need through in a time acceptable to the user. This also reduces the value of their data, and their ability to asymmetrically extort their massive networks.\n\nEssentially, we can protect token based authentications with expirations, so even if you spend the 30 days to break the packet you can\'t use the information to commit fraudulent transactions. Its only helpful to you if your law enforcement trying to prove a significant case (or perhaps a competing company practicing corporate espionage, but they it would take upwards of a year to crack the packet, making the information meaningless). \n\nEdit: I\'m at a bar and a bit drunk so sorry for not being concise. I also don\'t object to in person verification before you can be issued a signing authorization. Like an SSN or similar.\n\nSome implementations lead to the same type of identy fraud we have today, but not all. And even when it does occur it can be detected through pattern analysis of all packets from a certain signed user, similar to credit card fraud.\n\nRather than assuming what I\'m suggesting has such high level holes, could you think about it a bit more deeply and let me know if you see really fundamental problems that aren\'t addrrssable when I surrender freedom or anonymity in the Internet.

OPM and the interagency incident response team have concluded with high confidence that sensitive information, including the Social Security Numbers (SSNs) of 21.5 million individuals, was stolen from the background investigation databases. This includes 19.7 million individuals that applied for a background investigation, and 1.8 million non-applicants, primarily spouses or co-habitants of applicants. Some records also include findings from interviews conducted by background investigators and approximately 5.6 million include fingerprints.

Hodling doesn\'t help the economy because the deflation it causes is artificial. Once someone sells their Bitcoin, they negate the changes they made to the price when they first bought. Since nobody is going to hodl indefinitely (it\'s an investment, they\'ll cash out at some point), they don\'t contribute. If you want to help Bitcoin by actually reducing circulation, burn coins.\n\nNow, there is nothing wrong with Hodling, but I do have a problem with people who hodl under the guise that they are "helping the system" when they are, in fact, doing no such thing. Helping Bitcoin on a consumer level would be doing just that, consuming. Spending your Bitcoin in support of Bitcoin businesses and merchants contributes to Bitcoin. Hell, if you want to take it a step further, do some freelance work in Bitcoin and spend the fruits of your labor to support the businesses.\n\nThe point is, hodling serves a purpose of artificially and temporarily effect the price, but since all hodlers are inevitably waiting for the right point to cash out, the \'benefit\' is nothing more than that shift in the price. \n\nFor the economy to actually grow, consumption is needed. The extremely low propensity to consume among Bitcoin users is one of the major inhibitors of growth. This isn\'t a problem solely found in the Bitcoin ecosystem. If you don\'t think this concept is a real thing, look at Japan\'s economy. Their economy has endured decades of little growth and stagnation due to the saving mindset that dominates the culture.

The more consumption that takes place, the higher the GDP goes. In edition, the higher the average rate of consumption, the larger the effect. (10 dollars of income with an average consumption rate of 50% is better than 20 dollars at 25%, since the merchant will also spend 50% of what they earn, so on and so forth).\n\nYou do bring up solid points on blocksize and mass consumption. The current system does not support mass consumption. However, the current price level does not either. The price increases have been largely due to speculators measures, which hodling could be seen as a variable of. However, if a person does sell their coins (and every investor does have an intention to sell at some point, that's the point of investing) they completely negate the effect they made when they first purchased their coins. You are right that not every saver has sold out, but each does have a price tag to sell at. Now, those who choose to exchange their Bitcoin for goods and services at the right time (what I assume you are implying when you mention not al savers plan to sell) are not grouped into the same category, as they do plan to contribute via consumption.\n\nConsumption is the only way to create use cases for Bitcoin, because merchants and businesses cannot operate without customers. Sure, Bitcoin may retain speculators value for some period of time, but if it becomes clear that there are no actual uses (which will be the case in an extreme setting where nobody consumes) then price will eventually drop to 0. Conversely, if more people use their Bitcoin, more use cases will appear, leading to increased adoption and overall usage, which will organically increase the price.\n\nSure, individuals will act out of self interest, but their self interests can have a positive (or negative) impact on larger entities. Money supports businesses. The more Bitcoin you send to Bitcoin merchants, the more that niche will grow. Saying you an individual can't help an economy uses the same logic as saying an individual can't effect the price.

And with the current blocksize limit, mass consumption is mathematically impossible. Yet people hold bitcoin, and a million dollars in bitcoin are mined/fee\'d per day.\n\nAnd I don\'t know where your "help the economy" stuff comes from. No individual actor can "help the economy." That doesn\'t even make sense. They act in self interest. The aggregation of self interest called saving happens to increase the value (and thereby likely expenditure) for the remaining economy.

The moral and legal norms were by fiat of the Church and power was highly concentrated through violence and moral legitimacy by superstitional interpretation of the Word of God in rare and indecipherable Latin Bibles.  \n\nThe printing press made the Bible easily accessible in local langauges en masse, along with other works.

You have some big routers and small routers, but all that matters is finding a least jumps path through\n\nWhat I've heard proposed is that when you send a transaction you encode the route you choose using cryptography so that each step in the chain only knows who he will send to, not the final destination. So each jump knows who relayed it to them and where to relay next, but not the origin or route or destination": 7, "Hm. That sounds like a usability hurdle. Somewhere the work of predicting the efficiency of the route needs to be done. It doesn't seem practical to put it on the user, and then how to choose a route in the first place unless the clients provide that info?": 1, "I'd like to hear more about that.

Each LN node establishes a payment channel with a small number of other randomly selected LN nodes, much like a Bitcoin node today connects to a randomly chosen set of peers.\n\nLN nodes know each other by some pseudonymous cryptographic ID. There is no need for them to know each other's real identity or IP address, and it's better for privacy if they don't. Note that randomly selecting peers only works because LN is trustless. This wouldn't work for Ripple for example, despite some similarities between the two systems. The connected nodes form a densely connected mesh that has no relationship to real-world social graphs.\n\nWhen you make a payment, your own node needs to find a path through the mesh, probably by consulting some global database. This is similar to what Ripple does today, but with fewer privacy concerns because the identities of the nodes are basically unknowable and nodes can change their IDs periodically. More advanced variants might try to use some sort of ant routing to avoid needing a globally visible graph of payment channels, but I'm not sure that can scale.\n\nWhen your node has established a path, it uses onion routing to send the payment to its destination, so no hop along the way knows both the sender and recipient's cryptonym.

He later said something about an 'automotive related' channel.\n\nI'm confused as to what the reality will look like.

In short AFAIK LN efficiency comes from pairing users with common paths. Users with unpredictable txn patterns carry a premium as they have less common paths. Thus, the fee pressure in LN favors the knowability of user intent and history. If the cost to make on-chain transactions is high enough, LN might only be feasible for highly optmized routing, and thus a requisite sacrifice of privacy.': 1, "I'm not sure what you mean by that, it will be like choosing a wallet today.

Design-wise, the change is the equivalent of putting a chargeback button right on someone\'s credit card, so they can reverse their payment as soon as they walk out of the store without even the need to collude with the bank. \n\nThe change makes no sense.

The person would owe you the equivalent of $160,000. There is a very good chance you won't get your principal returned to you.

First, all things have risk, and ALL profit/loss in bitcoin is tied to the exchange rate.  So far I've only run across 3 ways to invest in hashrate, (Cloudmining).  One is Genesis Mining, one is Hashnest, the other is BW.com.  BW I just came across last week, and am in my pre-order phase with, I don't have numbers on them yet to work with.  The other two yield anywhere from 0.1-0.2% daily return, however, at Genesis mining, you cannot withdraw funds.  Once hashrate is bought there, it's permanent, and gives daily payouts.  You'd probably see your initial investment back in about a year.  At hashnest, you CAN pull out your funds, but you're doing stock market style hashrate buys, (don't buy the S7 miners to run in the center, they're overpriced compared to buying one to run at home).  Since you'd be doing your hashrate buys there, remember that you either want to buy low/sell high, or WAIT for ROI.  You do get your numbers so you can do that calc pretty easily.

And Fairbrix was an offshoot of Tenebrix. The guy who created Tenebrix was apparently a wiseass guy from Belarus (Lolcust) and I paid him something like 250 TBX for him to create for me FBX. Unlike his project, Tenebrix, my coin, Fairbrix, would not be premined. It would, however, retain his key feature of using the Scrypt hashing algorithm. I thought it was a fun little deal. Well wouldn't you know it, Fairbrix had a bug. After a certain amount of blocks, it stopped paying out.\n\nProject abandoned, right? Not so fast.\n\nSo I get onto IRC asking around for help (I'm in no way a programmer) and me and about 3 others (Charles Lee, AKA, Coblee, being one of them) decide to retry. We decided that calling it Fairbrix again, after such a colossal failure of a launch (IIRC, it was actually launched twice, with each one failing) was going to be bad press, so we named our new creation Litecoin. Someone set up a webpage and I kind of served as editor for that. I helped manage the parameters of the new coin and kind of served as general manager for a while, but ultimately, because it was clearly Charles who was the brains of the outfit coding wise, it fell to him to release the coin and make the announcement.\n\nhttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=47417.0\n\nLike all alt-coins, it was super easy to mine and before I knew it, I had 25,000 of them. If memory serves, Charles even gave me several thousand. What no one really knew was that I didn't really think the project would take off like it did. I'm still a little puzzled at why people value LTC. I, myself, own none. So when they became worth a little bit, like a couple hundred dollars, I sold. I needed the money, or at least, I felt at the time that I did, and that was that.\n\nFast forward two years later. Litecoin becomes, for a time, worth about $50 per coin. My couple hundred dollars would have been over a million. It took a while to get fully over that.\n\nNow I have a very small amount of BTC (way, way down from my peak of 200 which were also sold when they were worth very little) that I'm just holding. So, the answer to your question is, yes... they exist, but many sold before they got rich.": 18, 'That might be nice, but I don\'t see much use for it economically.
