In essence, the proposal is incomplete in terms of fostering an implementation.  See: http://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2015-August/010585.html .  Basically, it\'s a work in progress, and Jeff hopes to have something closer to a proposal that can be formalized and implemented soon.\n\nBecause of this, the answer to question 5(a) is that, right now, it\'s not likely that BIP100 is voted into effect because there\'s technically no voting mechanism at this time.  Miners who are signing their coinbase scriptSig with \'BIP100\' are at best lending support to some form of BIP100.  \nThe question to 5(b) being 8MB is based on those miners who are using the \'/BVsizeinbytes/\' signature in their coinbase scriptSig, as suggested in the BIP100 proposal.  the \'sizeinbytes\' has been \'8000000\' for most blocks (maybe all, haven\'t checked in a while).': 2}, ('Did I fuck up?

They still can't upload faster than other nodes can download.

I would think trying to shut out small miners with big blocks would be harder to do with big blocks than with small blocks due to network propagation time.  Just cause small miners can't download the most recent block and work on top of it on the next one fast enough?  Doesn't SPV mining solve that problem, where you just get the headers and start working on the next block before you have the most recent one completely downloaded?": 3, 'The problem is that home connections usually have lower upload than download speeds. Also bigger miners likely have direct connections between them. Thus they can quickly transfer blocks between them without caring much about slower nodes since they can wait longer. Now smaller miners get increased orphan rate.\n\nAfter things like IBLT and alternative scaling solutions are developed and we have further info about bandwidth trends we could do another hard fork possibly with completely different approach.': 2, "There are two main arguments against BIP 101's 8MB blocks.  One goes that the network of full nodes won't have enough upload bandwidth to relay 8MB blocks.  Nodes with lower upload bandwidth will leech from the network, slowing the whole thing down.  At best this would centralize functional full nodes to data centers, at worst it would create a never ending loop where the block chain gets longer and longer and nodes are never able to catch up.\n\nThe other argument is that miners with lower bandwidth will see higher orphan rates due to not being able to propagate their new blocks in time before someone else finds it and propagates it.  I don't really see this one as much of a concern, because miners can manually set their block sizes to whatever they want on an individual basis.  Just because max size is 8MB, even if there are enough txs to take up 8MB, miners with low bandwidth can simply create 1MB blocks instead if they are worried about orphans.  For example, most miners are mining max 750kb block sizes now (which is the default setting in core) as we saw during the spam attacks.  So that's really a non-issue, imo.\n\nSo to the first concern, it may be valid, it may not be.  There's no real world data, at least not that I've seen, just simulations or Gavin's initial closed network test.  The dogecoin dev team is planning such a test this coming Sunday on the dogecoin testnet.  As you know, dogecoin has max 1MB blocks every 1min, so this test will have a throughput of 15 transactions per second sustained for 1 hour, which is not dogecoin's theoretical capacity, but it's still about 5 times higher than bitcoin's.  We'll be collecting data on orphan rates, block propagation time and bandwidth usage.  If the test goes well, we'll do a larger and higher throughput test in September.  The more testnet nodes we have during the test, the more representative of a real world network it will be, we need nodes with diverse hardware and bandwidth.  So, I'd like to invite /r/bitcoin to spin up a dogecoin testnet node and participate in the upcoming test this Sunday.

The BitFinex source code is based on the notoriously insecure Bitcoinica source code that was leaked in July, and one forum poster, Davout, found that one could use one of the same exploits against Bitfinex that worked against Bitcoinica when it was still operational: set the leverage to 10,000, put in a small amount of money, and wait for the price to move. If it moves even slightly down, the leverage effect ensures that the result will be immediate liquidation. If it moves up, however, the size of the account balance will jump up by ten thousand times the increase in the underlying BTC price, securing a profit margin far above 100%. Other issues, such as the use of floating point numbers (a form of binary scientific notation typically used to represent non-integer values in computers but known for their inexactness when trying to store decimal values) to store account balances, were also discovered. Even though Bitfinex\xe2\x80\x99s creator Raphael Nicolle claims that \xe2\x80\x9cBitfinex is now much more powerful and robust\xe2\x80\x9d, the discovery of such flaws so soon after Bitfinex\xe2\x80\x99s beta release bodes ill for such an otherwise promising startup\n\n>Secondly, the \xe2\x80\x9cno hot wallet\xe2\x80\x9d setup that is at the core of BitFinex\xe2\x80\x99s design, although admirable, has a problem of its own: if, over the course of one day, it happens that users are consistently buying more BTC than selling, or vice versa, then in order for BitFinex to be able to honor all of its users\xe2\x80\x99 positions it needs to step in and act as the counterparty to some of its users itself. This kind of setup is known as a bucket shop and is heavily frowned upon (and in many jurisdictions even illegal) because it creates perverse incentives \xe2\x80\x93 the shop can potentially make an order on the markets large enough to significantly bump the price up, liquidate all of its users who had opposite positions at high leverage, and keep all of their funds as profits. Even if Nicolle does not want to create a bucket shop, given a no hot wallet setup Bitfinex may have no choice but to periodically temporarily become one.\n\n': 1, "Lots of big accounts are leaving bitfinex since they've fcked up.": 2, '[**@btcWhaleclub**](https://twitter.com/btcWhaleclub):\n>[2015-08-26 23:29:28 UTC](https://twitter.com/btcWhaleclub/status/636681900510310400)\n\n>My new sounds: Giancarlo Devasini Bitfinex CFO 26/08/2015 On the trading interruption [*soundcloud.com*](https://soundcloud.com/whaleclub-bitcoin/giancarlo-devasini-bitfinex-cfo-26082015-on-the-trading-interruption) on [#SoundCloud](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23SoundCloud)\n\n----\n\n[^[Mistake?]](/compose/?to=TweetPoster&subject=Error%20Report&message=/3ij3vp%0A%0APlease leave above link unaltered.)\n[^[Suggestion]](/message/compose/?to=TweetPoster&subject=Suggestion)\n[^[FAQ]](/r/TweetPoster/comments/13relk/)\n[^[Code]](https://github.com/buttscicles/TweetPoster)\n[^[Issues]](https://github.com/buttscicles/TweetPoster/issues)\n': 2, "Can't say I'm surprised...

Could multiple computers be used to form a full node?', 5): {"Sort of, but it probably wouldn't do exactly what you want. The main reason for using a cluster is because 1 machine can't do all the work. Lets assume a network where something has happened where a node does not have enough resources to be a full node, but wants to be as useful/safe as possible.\n\nThe resources that could most obviously run out are network bandwidth, CPU power, and hard drive space.\n\nHard drive space has already been address about as well as possible. Pruning can be enabled for a full node quite easily and reduces the needed disk space to a quite trivial amount (~1GB right now). If somebody wrote a custom serializer they could probably squeeze a few more percent of space out of this. If a node doesn't have enough space it can map a remote disk using a technology like NFS. If we want it to look more like a cluster it can use something like Tahoe-lafs or gluster to distribute the storage requirements of several other computers.\n\nCPU power is a bit more tricky. Right now once bitcoin coin has caught up to the tip of the blockchain it doesn't really use much CPU power. There are plans to replace OpenSSL with libsecp256k1 which should reduce the CPU usage by at least 5x even while catching up. To get any better than that we need to start getting creative. For example, if we assume that all the nodes in the cluster are trusted we could delegate signature verification to seperate nodes and have a master node check transaction validity against the UTXO and other consensus rules. If the other nodes are untrusted, I'm not sure exactly how this could be sharded into multiple pieces.\n\nThe final resource that could run out is network bandwidth. Right now the bitcoin protocol has several inefficiencies that cause data to get transmitted several times. There have been several ideas to improve the protocol including http://sourceforge.net/p/bitcoin/mailman/message/31604935/. In the end you will need at least MaxBlockSize download bandwidth every 10 minutes to guarantee that you can download all the blocks. While you are catching up you will need to download the entire blockchain (currently ~45GB). If UTXO commitments get implemented, then you can pick any UTXO commitment and start catching up from there significantly reducing the total bandwidth you need (at a tradeoff of some security). In a trusted cluster, the cluster would need to have at least external bandwidth to stay caught up with the blockchain. Even then it doesn't make much sense because a SPV node can stay caught up by only downloading the headers and probably requires less trust than a cluster.\n\nHopefully this didn't devolve into to many generalities about bitcoin scalability. In the end, I don't see too much of a need/use for bitcoin specific clusters. IMO, if UTXO commitments are implemented it could lead to some interesting cluster-like behavior, but it would be more like a bunch of partial nodes than a traditional cluster.": 2}, ('Bitcoin Block Size Debate Survey - What is your opinion?', 33): {"I don't have enough technical knowledge to comment but I hope that people have their eye on the big picture and the long road ahead.": 1, 'If you can think of a more interesting wording for a question, in which opinion of coinholders matters, please post it.

The NotXT nodes may decide to stop voting for XT when the 750/1000 threshold is reached, just to fuck with the perceptions of those who are looking for where the majority is, or are just anxious about the fork. Then, over the grace period you may see something like 499/1000 (but the software doesn't take any consideration of these votes as far as I know). Unless you have a large miner or a landslide of many small miners all switching around the 75% mark you would have the vote only touch 75% and then plummet to <50%. Then many XT supporters will rightfully be anxious and will have to decide what to do. Then someone, perhaps even someone who was using NotXT, mines the first >1MB block just to initiate the fork and it's action time.\n\nPractically all miners know that there can be voting for one while doing the other. It will probably be very hard for all participants to know what each side's strength really is.\n\n>  reorg that could conceivably just be patched away\n\nIt can indeed be patched away - but those are extra actions by devs and miners (by the way, it would practically make it official that XT is an altcoin). And it can be done only after some time has passed (at a minimum a dozen blocks, perhaps more), otherwise it's controversial to do that. So there will likely be an opportunity for many short length reorgs that make many >1MB blocks stale. My point is that if there are conviction supporters for both chains who keep both chains alive then those on the XT chain will lose some blocks, while those on the Bitcoin Core chain will not. It may just add that little loss that bankrupts a marginal XT miner, or forces him to switch to a different mining strategy or chain - anything that keeps him afloat.

Especially over such a long period. Fake supporters are convincing undecideds to switch.\n\n> Even if the true XT miners actually hold more than a majority, e.g. 55%, the minority will still catch up from time to time, making the XT fork stale!\n\nAnd how long do you imagine 45% of the hashpower is willing to mine on a statistically inferior chain?

Once 750 blocks occur, the fork happens, but that doesn\'t necessarily imply that any blocks will be mined that separate xt from core any time soon due to soft limits.  It could be many months before an actual block larger than 1MB, and thus "out of spec" is actually produced.

His brother.': 3, 'Miners approve of a BIP which renders them the sole decidors of block size, ergo of fees? wow, surprising.': 9, 'Hi Hector,\n\n\nBIP 100 isn\'t currently implemented. I guess we\'d put together some more concrete thoughts if and when it is coded up.\n\n\nMy initial thoughts are that I prefer BIP 101 because:\n\nThe BIP 100 voting mechanism doesn\'t seem fully thought out. A majority of miners can always win any vote because they can just orphan blocks that contain votes for something they don\'t like. So the more complex approach doesn\'t seem really robust.\n\nBut that\'d require special code. If most miners just adopt the defaults, then it\'s possible for a minority of hash power to drag the block size down to nearly nothing.\xc2\xa0\n\nIt\'s quite common for miners to just accept whatever the defaults are, regardless of whether they make sense. That\'s why we still see 750kb blocks sometimes when the network is actually backlogged (XT fixes this).\n\nI think the reason is that miners, not unreasonable, assume the Bitcoin Core developers are selecting default behaviour in sensible ways. Alas it\'s not the case anymore, because they feel choosing opinionated defaults is "centralising". This is why the XT manifesto specifically states we will pick defaults as we think best.\n\nThe BIP100 default is 1 megabyte.\xc2\xa0Thus by default miners would be voting for\xc2\xa0no change. However what we need is change!\n\nIt gives miners additional power to modify the system for no obviously good reason beyond "some miners are saying they\'d like more power". Miners are not the only stakeholders. Users, merchants, exchanges, etc matter too - if not more!\n\nThe upper limit is meant to be a kind of DoS limit, to stop troll miners generating giant mega-blocks. It\'s not meant to be a stick that miners can use to beat important but voteless economic players.\n\nThere\'s a risk that someone comes up with a business plan like this: \xc2\xa0 we will build a giant ASIC farm in the middle of a desert at the end of a piece of string and tin can (i.e. no bandwidth). This will be super cheap because of abundant land/solar/wind/whatever and the lack of bandwidth won\'t matter because we can just drag down the block size limit to ensure tiny blocks.\n\nThis would of course hurt the entire ecosystem for their own short term benefit, but BIP 100 would let them do that with just a small amount of the overall hash power.\n\nMiners have just\xc2\xa0one\xc2\xa0job: order transactions by time. They shouldn\'t be doing anything else, and arguably, people already freak out about the concentration of power in the hands of big mining pools. BIP 100 would make this issue worse.\n\n\n- Mike Hearn\n': 16, 'The Brother of the creator (and Multi millionaire from instamining) of Litecoin weighting in on Bitcoin block debate.

Did they have to change their deposit address? Somebody lost the private key?': 1, 'Yes, that is the general iteration strategy.  My point was simple: it is impossible to draw a conclusion on *why* conversion decreased from 2 A/B tests.  It is even more impossible to draw a stronger conclusion on whether or why Bitcoin decreases conversion from these tests.  Thousands of such tests are the standard for drawing similar conclusions.  The only conclusion that can be drawn from one A/B test is that A was better than B or vice versa, not *why*.  Why requires further analysis that is currently lacking for Bitcoin as a payment option.\n\n\nAgain, if you have any experience with A/B tests this is all quite obvious to you.  After a failed test on something like adding Bitcoin, the way forward is not to conclude that Bitcoin decreases conversions but rather to try alternate placements of the Bitcoin payment on the page to see whether each decreases conversion and by how much.  If you can conclude that all configurations including a Bitcoin option decrease conversion, then you can conclude that adding Bitcoin is a bad idea and adding Bitcoin would decrease conversion **with your UI, business, and customers** (further tests across market segments are required to draw general conclusions, as you well know).  But you still can\'t conclude *why* that is: whether it\'s a reputation issue with Bitcoin, an issue of more choices = less action, an issue with the target demographic of your business not being Bitcoin savvy, an issue of people preferring not to spend Bitcoin on the product type (for example, I\'m sure BTC VPS and VPN providers are getting tons of subscriptions while BTC makeup sellers are not), etc.  This all requires further research, backed by more traditional market analysis techniques.\n\n\nSo don\'t be too hasty to draw conclusions is all I\'m saying.  Especially with a corpus consisting of two very specific A/B tests with little useful data.  These are starting points for future investigation/experimentation, not scientific evidence of any conclusions as they are often peddled as.  Again, this is quite obvious.  Whereas this is ridiculous nonsense (and yet somehow upvoted?):\n\n> They were double blind legitimate scientific tests. If you doubt them then go join the anti-vaxxers and creationists.\n\n\nThe whole point of science is to question and doubt results.  If you blindly accept 2 small-corpus A/B tests as proof of anything, you are equally as unscientific as the anti-vaxxers and creationists who cite the same corpus of ~20 papers as evidence for their arguments.\n\n\nI believe the relevant idiom is "the jury is still out on this one".

So we have already lost over half of this claimed capacity but this is very likely to decrease over time as transaction sizes creep higher.

A good estimate for the network throughput when limited to 1MB blocks would be 2 to 4 tps depending on how optimistic you want to be.': 1, 'But, Bitcoin is about removing trusted third parties. Hosting a full node on a VPS qualifies as introducing a trusted third party, doesn\'t it?\n\nFurther, having extra expense of $10-40/month (equal to $120-480/year) just to continue running a full node does not seem like something many, if any, will do.\n\n> "A 100 Mbps internet connection can handle 8 MB average blocksizes pretty easily. A 20 Mbps can probably handle whatever blocks we actually get with an 8 MB cap. After that, BIP101 says 2x blocksize every 2 years. Nelson\'s law of bandwidth growth is basically equal to that. I don\'t see what your problem is."\n\nFinally, 100 Mbps connections are very rare, relatively speaking. A 20 Mbps connection can handle a hypothetical block size with 8MB cap, but what if the reality is different? Right now, 99% of bitcoin txs occur off-chain. With larger blocks, there is incentive to pour more txs on-chain due to presumably lower fees and greater capacity of the network to handle more txs. The logical conclusion is the network will swell to use up at least 50% of the extra capacity fairly quickly. Or, if you disagree on that, then explain convincingly why not?\n\nThe result of the three things above is that number of full nodes will fall drastically, while introduction of TTPs like VPS to host full nodes will increase. This means Bitcoin will become more centralized, thus ultimately harming its security and value proposition.

I prefer the latter scenario. As I see it, a few years from now, hobbyists can either buy medium-high-end hardware with a decent internet connection (100-1000 Mbps) or rent a VPS in a datacenter if they want to keep up with the Bitcoin blockchain. If they really want to run a full node on a Raspberry Pi, they can use an altcoin.\n\nKeep in mind that the protocol-level blocksize cap is very different from the average blocksize. Miners have an incentive to keep their blocks small in order to reduce orphan rates. See https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/43331625/feemarket.pdf for more information on that. Miners will keep their blocks to a size that can be propagated through most of the bitcoin network, reaching the vast majority of miners (by hashrate), within about one minute or less. Even in 2036, when the BIP101 blocksize limit reaches 8192 MB, typical blocks will only be as large as typical hardware of that day can handle.\n\nFor non-mining full nodes, the technical requirements are much lower than for mining full nodes. Non-mining nodes have to keep up with transaction and block volume, but do not have any significant latency constraints on how they do so. Mining nodes, on the other hand, need to be able to handle new blocks within seconds.  If most people have 200 Mbps of spare bandwidth, then they should be able to handle the full 8 GB.\n\nSmall blocks mean high transaction fees.

It would be best if you and the rest of the core developers joined the existing consensus among miners and users in support of large (>= 8 MB) blocks.\n\n>There are better designs that support bursting.\n\n>You're a miner right? (toomim mining I recognise from bitcointalk) so I think it's fairly clear that for supply and demand reasons if blocks are currently < 1/2 full average and about 1/2 of those transactions are < $1, then if the blocksize is jumped to 8MB the network will be overcapacity by 16-32x. Now if there is an excess of supply, price falls, ergo fees will drop to zero basically. If you're a miner this is maybe not to your advantage.\n\n>Hosted wallet companies may want free fees. I'm not sure if you do.\n\n>Gavin has said some keynsian subsidy things like he wants to subsidise fees by increasing the blocksize.\nMaybe come to the http://scalingbitcoin.org[1] conference or watch the live-stream they're trying to setup and participate via IRC.\n\n>I think it should be uncontroversial that multiple BIPs be reviewed and tested, simulated, the best one selected and deployed. That's what people are working on.\n\nMy response:\n\n> if the blocksize is jumped to 8MB the network will be overcapacity by 16-32x. Now if there is an excess of supply, price falls, ergo fees will drop to zero basically.\n\nI do not think that fees will drop if supply increases with demand holding constant. I've made that argument at [this link](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3i2hke/august_23_2015_block_size_and_hard_fork_dialog/cudq76o), but I will make it again below.\n\nI think we're currently at or close to the floor of the demand curve in terms of fees -- that is, I think that fees per kB are currently low enough that people don't care about them and don't pay attention to them. The main thing that determines fee/tx is the default setting in the bitcoin clients that people use.\n\nFees reached their peak in 2013 when the average blocksize was about 150 kB. In December, total fees reached US$20k/day, or about 25\xc2\xa2/tx. Shortly after that, version 0.8.2 of bitcoin-qt was released, which dropped the default fees from 0.5 mBTC/kB to 0.1 mBTC/kB. Fees have never reached the same level since. \n\nDuring the stress tests, total fees reached about $10k-14k/day, or about 7.7\xc2\xa2/tx. Now that the stress test is over and blocks are no longer congested, fees are about $5.6k/day or 4.9\xc2\xa2/tx. Thus, when blocks were actually full, the average fee size increased by about 57%. Block transaction volume was about 58% higher. Unconfirmed transaction volume (and congestion) was higher than that.\n\nhttps://www.quandl.com/data/BCHAIN/TRFUS-Bitcoin-Total-Transaction-Fees-USD\n\nhttps://www.quandl.com/data/BCHAIN/TRFEE-Bitcoin-Total-Transaction-Fees\n\nhttps://www.quandl.com/data/BCHAIN/NTRBL-Bitcoin-Number-of-Transaction-per-Block\n\nhttps://blockchain.info/charts/n-transactions?show_header=true&daysAverageString=7&timespan=all\n\nThese data suggest to me that the fees per tx do not change much with moderate block congestion. (This might be improved somewhat with better client support for changing or automatically determining fees based on congestion.) Furthermore, the degree of overcapacity (2.5x vs 6x) seems to be completely irrelevant. Fees were higher when we had 6x overcapacity than they are now. Fees appear to only change based on on limited supply if the blocks are actually full. If we wish to increase fees by limiting block sizes, we would have to ensure that most or all blocks were full. In order to achieve the $2/tx to $20/tx needed to pay for the current 300 MW, 400 PH/s mining network with 1 MB blocks, that congestion would need to be extreme.\n\nI think that artificially limiting blocksize to drive up fees is a terrible idea, since:\n\n1. It ensures that some or most demand will not be met in a timely fashion.\n2. The amount of demand that is met is fixed vs. time and does not scale to meet spikes in demand.\n3. It does not inspire confidence in the capacity of the Bitcoin system.\n4. It worsens the user experience considerably (long and unpredictable delays in transaction verification--block delay projections depend on how many competing transactions are added with higher fees and many other factors).\n5. It promotes non-revenue-generating off-chain transactions as a method of fee-dodging and worsens the problem of paying for mining. Off-chain transactions do not generate fees in proportion to how much value the blockchain provides to the transaction as well as on-chain transactions do.\n6. It promotes the creation or use of altcoins with larger or more frequent blocks. \n7. It makes bandwidth costs for miners irrelevant, and doesn't encourage miners to improve their connectivity. The capacity of Bitcoin transaction processing infrastructure will not improve, but power consumption for mining may continue to increase. \n8. The environmental cost per on-chain transaction will increase beyond the current 62.5 kWh/tx.\n\nMy preferred method for increasing fee revenue is this:\n\n1. Scale up volume aggressively. Aim for 100x growth in 15 years. That would correspond to 36% growth per year. (Bitcoin demand has been increasing about 50% to 100% every year so far.)\n2. Keep the default fee/tx in real (USD) terms somewhere between $0.05/tx and $0.25/tx until miner revenue comes 50% from fees, then start to reduce the default fee/tx in order to keep total real miner revenue close to constant.\n\nIf volume can't be scaled up fast enough, then average fees will need to increase. It will be much easier to scale up revenue if Bitcoin has high transaction volume in e.g. 2025 than if we scare users away with limited supply and high fees. ": 20, "Under BIP 100, a minority of miners could harm bitcoin by keeping blocksize permanently at 1MB. Isn't that a good enough reason to not leave it purely to miners?": 6, '> It does not inspire confidence in the capacity of the Bitcoin system.\n\nI think the core thing you are missing is that this is not at all about scaling to meet demand, whether it be actual or hypothetical. This is about supplying as much capacity as the technological constraints of a mainstream PC (to run a full node, with significant buffers to allow new nodes to catch up as well) allow in order to maintain decentralization. Demand will have to adjust to the constraints of reality(via various offchain solutions), not the other way around.\n\nAssuming you agree with the above statement, then it is not possible to aim for X growth in Y years, because nobody knows how CPU/Bandwidth/Storage will scale for the average home PC.\nSo far only BIP100 has a human element of voting, which allows voters to to assess and determine these factors, unfortunately we only know of ways to let miners vote and miners do not have the average full node user in their interests.\n': 4, "Constant time block propagation is already implemented by Matt Corallo's relay network, as well as p2pool.": 4, "Then suggest new parameters.

There is currently no centralizing force in mining because rewards are linear with the hashing power, big and small get equally rewarded in proportion. However, when connectivity enters in the considerations, you are then more likely to benefit the bigger miners.\n\nMining is already critically centralized (mainly through stratum pools) and I do not get why we would risk making this worse.

In addition to empirical evidence that shows this is not the case (e.g., fees existed when the average block size was much smaller than today), this paper shows that a transaction fee market would exist even in the *absence of a block size limit*:\n\nhttps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/43331625/feemarket.pdf\n\nIf the block size is not constrained by the protocol, then the fee per kilobyte is governed largely by the orphan cost.  The orphan cost is a function of the propagation impedance for block solutions.  Raising the block size limit does not affect the propagation impedance.  Fees per kilobyte would be largely unchanged; however, since more kilobytes of transactions could be included in a block, the *total* fees per block could grow higher.  \n\nAs the average block size grows, so would the total fees collected by miners, assuming the network propagation impedance remains constant.

From my perspective:\n\n* BIP100: miners maintain a transaction fee market by voting on an adjustable system-wide hard cap that maxes out at 32MB. It's unlikely, but possible that we could reach 32MB blocks in only 1 year after BIP100 activates.\n\n* BIP101: miners maintain a transaction fee market by setting individual soft caps and competing against other miners as hard cap grows at a predictable rate to 8GB in 2036.\n\nIt seems to me that regardless of what block size limit algorithm is chosen, miners will always have the freedom to set their soft caps lower if they deem it to give them a competitive advantage.

Once only miners are able to run full nodes, they are literally sitting ducks for coercion, government manipulation, protocol manipulation. The economic majority would not care about Bitcoin if it became just another fiat currency.\n\nIt's really not hard to see full nodes continue declining as block size increases. Do not forget that unlike miners, full nodes have no financial incentives to run one. Everyone is either using SPV or a web wallet like coinbase. Nobody other than miners or a few big bitcoin businesses has any idea what the state of the ledger is. If Bitcoin became a $100 billion currency, these few businesses and miners have all the incentives to change the protocol.

It's actually good that it requires 80% of miners to do something that centralizes mining.": 0, '> But, Bitcoin is about removing trusted third parties. Hosting a full node on a VPS qualifies as introducing a trusted third party, doesn\'t it?\n\nYou shouldn\'t store private keys on a VPS. Don\'t run a wallet on a VPS. The VPS hoster could see the private keys decrypted in memory or install a keylogger trojan into sshd. Looking at the other use cases for a full node, I don\'t see any opportunities for the VPS host to perform an attack that would have any utility to the host.\n\nIf you want to run a wallet tied to a full node that you control, you should do something like using a VPS to run a full node that runs your own Electrum server. The full node\'s purpose is to keep an exhaustive record of bitcoin transactions; creating and signing transactions for your wallet can be done elsewhere, like on a Trezor, an airgapped offline Armory netbook, or Mycelium running on your cell phone. \n\nIn this sort of configuration, the VPS host company could manipulate your full node to give incorrect transaction history for your addresses. If they did this, they would not be able to steal your funds. By giving you incorrect information, they could prevent you from creating valid transactions by telling you incorrect information about the inputs for your bitcoin transactions, but they can\'t trick you into signing a valid transaction with different outputs than you want. That is, they can deny you access to your funds as long as you use your compromised full node. This attack would be easy to detect and bypass by simply checking your balance with one or two other (e.g.) Electrum servers or full nodes operated by random strangers using different VPS providers. \n\nIf you just run a full node as a contribution to the decentralization of the bitcoin full node network, then compromising your full node could be used for a Sybil attack. However, Sybil attacks are difficult to perform, since you usually need much more than 50% of all the full nodes under your control in order to conduct them effectively, and a VPS hosting company would be better off creating hundreds or thousands of competing full nodes for an attack rather than trying to compromise yours.\n\n> Right now, 99% of bitcoin txs occur off-chain. \n\nI think you mean on-chain. Very few transactions occur off-chain right now. Generally, the only transactions that occur off-chain are transactions within a single exchange or web wallet provider, like Coinbase-to-Coinbase transactions or \n\n> With larger blocks, there is incentive to pour more txs on-chain due to presumably lower fees and greater capacity of the network to handle more txs.\n\nFees are currently not influenced by limited block space. If we increase block sizes, fees will remain about the same. If we do not increase block sizes, then blocks will get congested, and latency will increase for transactions without larger fees. So with larger blocks, capacity increases, and we don\'t deny people access to inexpensive on-chain transactions.\n\nThe transactions that are currently done off-chain will stay off-chain because the main incentive for these transactions being off-chain (e.g. in exchanges) is instantaneousness, and that will not be changed by the blocksize cap.\n\n> The logical conclusion is the network will swell to use up at least 50% of the extra capacity fairly quickly.\n\nNo. Bitcoin block sizes have not been a limitation to growth rates in the past. For the vast majority of bitcoin\'s history, the block size cap has been 10x to 1000x the average block sizes. Blocks have generally only been full for about two weeks during a few stress tests in the last few months. The network swelling rate has been limited only by demand so far. Average block sizes are currently about 450 kB with a 1 MB cap, which means that if we don\'t increase the block size cap, we will see something new: chronically congested blocks and a limitation on bitcoin growth by the block size cap. \n\nYou\'re arguing that increasing the block size will cause off-chain transactions to move on-chain. This is factually incorrect, as there are currently very few off-chain transactions. The more common and more valid argument is that letting blocks get congested will motivate people to move on-chain transactions off-chain. However, there\'s a problem: there are no working off-chain trustless decentralized systems for people to move to. The options for off-chain transactions are a few systems that don\'t yet exist (Lightning Network and sidechains), and a bunch of entities like Coinbase that require you to trust them. None of these options are good. In a few years, that might be different.\n\nHow many bitcoin full nodes do you think bitcoin needs to be "decentralized"? In my opinion, bitcoin full-node decentralization is the least important type of decentralization. Non-mining bitcoin full nodes don\'t really do much. Miner decentralization matters, pool decentralization matters, and developer decentralization matters. The only serious concern that having a large number of full nodes protects against is Sybil attacks, and I think there is not a large risk of those being practical or very useful. Another thing about Sybil attacks: If the number of full nodes decreases because the cost of running a full node is higher, then the cost of running full nodes for a Sybil attack will also be high.

Now that I learned more about the issue, I can see that there\'s still use of floats instead of integer or decimal, so we\'ll organize a migration of the database and the code to get ride of float. I hope to have these done in the coming two weeks. Meanwhile, I don\'t think this is that big of a deal to use the platform but I\'ll leave this up to you guys to decide. (for those who don\'t know what this is, the is a precision issue in the calculation, floats aren\'t exactely precise (we\'re talking satoshis precision here).*\n\n>***-what\'s the difference with bitcoinica?*** *Not much in the general behavior.* ***We asked to move as much hard coded constant as possible to database for ease of maintenance.*** We adapted the calculation of interests rates to what we feeled was more pertinent to reflect the need in funds and attract depositors. Right now the deposit rates are higher that they will be in the future to attract more depositors. We are fully hedged (not partly as bitcoinica);  Our idea of bitfinex is simple: we lend you money to leverage your trade. That\'s why we match 1 to 1 your order against mtgox (or internal orders if possible). So we remunerate not much on the spread but more on the "swap". And we remunerate deposit because this is where the money comes from. We changed the withdrawal behavior and the deposit watch routine; we use an armory script that we adapted to monitor bitcoins deposits and prepare unsigned bitcoins transactions. The platform is hosted on dedicated servers which we fully control and are extremely secure, no use of cloud providers and the like. These are security features which we feel are strong, not like bitcoinica and not like many other platforms. I\'am very positive that you\'re money is safe.*\n\n>*-the trust issue: yes, MPOE lady you are right, this is a big issue. At this point I don\'t see what I could do more than exposing my full name, address and photo, and being as transparent as I can.

Of the 13, 4 deposited a total of 36 bitcoins and 75 usd (plus our own reserve of bitcoins and usd). Of these 4, only 2 traded actively for several days, for a total volume of 419 bitcoins. This was enough to test the engine, but is still pathetically small. *\n\n>*Also on friday, when bitcoin price hit a bottom, everyone got fully long on bitcoins until the usd reserves were exhausted. Then came Guruvan, who tried to open yet an other long position, and couldn\'t because there weren\'t any usd reserve left (beside the minimum required to process user USD balances). Guruvan then withdrew all his coins, and I processed his withdrawal like I should. What would you have prefered Guruvan, that we let you open all the positions you want, but then are unable to process your withdrawal because we don\'t hedge your orders and have no money left?*\n\n>*That\'s why we need depositors!

If modern money is ultimately found lacking, it seems more likely that we will switch to post-modern money -- assuming that by then cryptocurrency will be widespread and immediately useful -- rather than switch to carrying sacks of gold or insisting that the numbers in my bank account are backed by some metal across the planet stored in another bank\'s vault. \n\nThe shift from modern money to post-modern money (bitcoin) will not occur from some mandate handed down by an authority. That is how the modern world works, not the post-modern world. The IMF and collection of central bankers are not going to have a top-secret meeting in response to an international currency crises and decide its time for everyone to switch to bitcoin. They may try to do something like that with regard to switching to a global fiat currency, but a post-modern currency can only come about in a decentralized and distributed manner consistent with post-modern consciousness. \n\nBitcoin adoption doesn\'t require an authority to mandate it. And that is really the problem with gold. People who are investing in gold are hoping that some authority is going to say, "Look, enough is enough! We have to go back to the gold standard!" But the only authority that could make this call are the international bankers and they don\'t want a gold standard, they want the SDR. They will use a monetary crisis to say, "See! This is a problem inherent in our continued reliance on national currencies! What will fix this is to have one global trans-national fiat currency! Owned and controlled by yours truly!!! Bwahahahaha!!!!!" They won\'t go back to gold, why would they ever give up the power to create money out of thin air?\n\nThe only future for money is a money that is adopted organically, horizontally, and freely in a manner consistent with the information age. That is to say, the only future for money is future money.

In the original source, in net.h, you\'ll see an IsValid() call that limits the size to "0x10000000". This appears to be 256 Mb, or 32 MB.

I\'m not exactly sure where enforcement happens but it sounds like MAX_SIZE (0x02000000, or 32 MB) in serialize.h is now used to enforce the 32 MB message limit.

The new maxblocksize for the next cycle is set to the _minimum_ that 80% accepts. In other words, if it's 4MB for the current cycle: if 79% vote for 8MB, 2% vote for 3MB, 19% vote for 2MB, new maxblocksize is 3MB. ": 1, '* Allowing the hard limit to decrease roughly serves the same purpose as miners enforcing a soft limit by orphaning blocks above a certain size, even though those blocks are under the hard limit. The difference is, with BIP 100, 80% of miners need to agree on the limit. Without it, only 51% of miners can enforce a soft limit. It is possible for 51% of miners to enforce a soft limit in BIP 100 too, but users might view miners using a mechanism other than the BIP 100 voting to enforce a limit as "not playing fair", and somehow punish them.\n* There\'s confusion about how BIP 100 is intended to work. I think the best interpretation is that you use the 20th percentile voter for an increase, but the 80th percentile voter for a decrease. That way you need 80% agreement from miners about any change to the limit. This eliminates the 21% attack.\n\nThe key point is that eventually (when more of mining revenue comes from fees) miners will probably set a soft limit to ensure there is at least some fee pressure. Right now there is not much consensus or data on how those soft limits should be set. The advantage of BIP 100 is that it sets out clear guidelines for how miners should be able to manage the effective limit. By adopting BIP 100, users are basically saying "miners, we think you should play be these rules" instead of leaving it up to miners to work out among themselves how they\'ll handle soft limits. So in effect BIP 100 constrains miners more by giving legitimacy to rules that are made by the entire community instead of just miners.\n\nThe main downside I see with BIP 100 is that there\'s no mechanism to rapidly increase the floating limit if demand spikes, because votes are on 3 month schedules. Perhaps adding an ability to increase the limit within a week or two if 95% of miners agree would help. There\'s also not much reason to enact ways for miners to create fee pressure now, since [we won\'t need any for many years](https://bitcoindebates.miraheze.org/wiki/Against_large_blocks#We_need_a_fee_market_eventually.2C_so_it.27s_good_for_one_to_develop_now). \n\nOne thing to note is that BIP 100 could be embedded within BIP 101. The max hard cap would be determined as in BIP 101, but the actual cap would move according to BIP 100 voting. ': 16, "You've just said - I don't know what this means but my guess is...\n": 1, "> With BIP101, we have a predictable rate of growth\n\nWouldn't dynamic block size be more in line with whatever the real world wants than a fixed, increasing block size? If an increasing block size is called for, it will be done.\n\nConversely, if the market favors having a lean and mean core blockchain supplemented by growthy sidechains for 2.0 use cases, combined with LN and voting pools for daily purchases, then BIP100 can readily adapt Bitcoin to that future.": 22, 'Great post. \n\nThere is a difference between BIP100 requiring 80% to reduce the limit and a cartel of 51% orphaning blocks that are too big.  Under BIP100 there is less incentive for each miner to defect from the group.  With the 51% smaller block cartel, the risk is the cartel cannot be controlled and the incentive is for each miner as an individual is to defect and build on larger blocks.  I think in a healthy mining industry this cartel will fail.': 10, 'The BIP says:\n\n"Votes are evaluated by dropping bottom 20% and top \n20%, and then the most common floor (minimum) is chosen."\n\nI agree that this is not clear.  I agree with you and that in your example 4MB should remain as the limit, and it should not fall to 3MB.\n\nMy understanding is that 4MB would be the most common floor.  The word "minimum" in this case may mean that the limit can not increase unless 80% of votes support it.  Although I could be wrong.  If I am wrong then I think BIP100 should be changed.': 8, 'Correct': 1, '> There\'s confusion about how BIP 100 is intended to work.

That way you need 80% agreement from miners about any change to the limit. This eliminates the 21% attack.\n\nHow do you arrive at this?  From the language in the BIP, I see nothing to suggest that 80% would be needed for a decrease or increase.  It appears to me that the middle 60% of votes will be used (attempting to discarding potential deviant votes) to perform a statistical analysis and calculation to find the "most common floor," whatever that is defined to be, and then use that as the new block size cap whether higher or lower.': 7, 'Never assume anything. \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3ipjnx/jeff_garzik_finally_explains_most_common_floor_in/': 1, 'Never assume anything.': 1, 'I\'m not sure of it, but it\'s my best guess because I think it\'s the only interpretation I\'ve heard that makes sense.

You could view the "most common floor" of a downward movement of the limit to be referring to minimum downward movement that all 60% of the remaining votes are OK with after you cut off the top and bottom 20%. It\'s a floor because its the minimum downward movement, and its most common because its the only one that all 60% are OK with. This is equivalent to the 80th percentile vote. \n\nI think Jeff is too smart to propose the version that lets 21% of hash power make the limit as small as they want.

One, just _one_ big pool can pull this off (think F2Pool and their shenanigans). \n\nIt\'s unimaginable that the major economic actors will go with this.': 3, 'I dont think this is right, my understanding is the bottom 21% can increase the limit, not reduce it.': 8, "> I think Jeff is too smart to propose the version that lets 21% of hash power make the limit as small as they want.

This will reduce the block size to the point where users have to pay more per txn.\n\nOn the other hand, this will also drive micro-transactions (low fee txns) away from Bitcoin which miners must realize is a very dangerous game since Bitcoin is only better than certain alt-coins because of the network effect.\n\nAlso, miners compete, so more space-efficient miners can vote a higher value both to run other miners out of business and because they are more profitable at higher block sizes.\n\nPersonally, I prefer BIP101 (Gavin\'s hard-coded 8MB limit that slowly increases) because miners can ALREADY "vote" for a block of size N by simply making their own blocks size N.  And the miner can refuse to build on top of a newly-mined egregiously-sized block, so it seems unlikely that a 1GB block filled with junk would be accepted.

If transaction volumes spike beyond what miners can technically handle, then tough titties, we have to deal with it. This will allow offchain methods to fill a role, allow expansion side channels like Lightning, and Sidechains a way to actually test themselves in a still relatively small userbase. It will also be an oppurtunity to allow a fee market to develop. This is not because of ideological "it needs to happen" arguments, its because the miners will have the rational incentive to up blocksize to what they can handle, and if it keeps steamrolling after that, will have every rational incentive to upgrade their equipment/connections to handle more. Being able to test those other things live if they are ready in time is a side benefit of a situation that is inevitable anyway. Unless we spike to hundreds of millions of people overnight, the fee market won\'t kill anything, it just might be another thing discouraging use in real third world countries(of which there are lots now as it is), and an inconvenience to users that might still be cheaper than fiat alternatives. \n\nAnd in the end, beyond that, miners will always have an incentive to upgrade to handle more transactions as the increase beyond capacity reaches a point of profitability, up til they literally can\'t handle anymore. Alternative protocols built ontop of the blockchain can handle the demand if its too much in those periods of growth, or when a ceiling is met. I think this is the best way to do it, and honestly the only way to stop a "civil war" from breaking out everytime anything with the limit comes up for debate.

Make a checkpoint on the first >1Mb block, and if necessary, even a hardcoded initial reduction on the difficulty (with 12,5% of hashpower, 8Mb would already give the same throughput though, so that might not be necessary). If enough coin holders go along, the value of BIP101 coins would be high enough to attract the miners.\n\nBut no... we're allowing them to decide, and, oh!, what a surprise, they prefer the option that gives them all the decision power!\n\nBut anyways. Even if miners end up with all the keys to set max block size in the future, that might not be that awful. After all, they're the ones who really need to hold the chain and validate it.

None of the proposals put them in charge. It just means that they get the final vote (which is how the mechanics of any BIP would work anyway). Since Bitcoin\'s creation, miners, users, and developers have all seen their influence ebb and flow from time to time. We are now at a point where miner influence is very deep in spades (they have a very strong hand to play), and no BIP is going to simply get pushed through just because a small group of developers or users want it. Even the XT proposal has to get 75% miner/hash power support before it gets implemented. Giving miners final say makes a lot of sense to me, since miners ultimately shoulder the energy costs of actually securing the network. This doesn\'t mean miners are "dictators" or "in charge", it just means that their voices must be heard. Right now, we\'re seeing the influence of miners, but that influence can quickly evaporate if they go too far and users and developers no longer wish to participate in Bitcoin because of things like high transaction fees or a non-user-friendly protocol.': 5}, ('Roger Ver claims that he spent $100K on the development of the bitcoin.com site', 121): {'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4SCAw264qM': 13, 'Looks good to me.

It\'s scarce, it is hard to inflate (although that\'s a bit murky), and cultures have for some reason or the other given it value, which the "fair market" determines at any given point. \n\nThe current gold price, like bitcoin\'s, is not pegged to anything; it depends entirely on what traders and investors think/hope that the price will be in some future date.  And the price at that date, of course, will depend entirely on what the traders will think/hope, on that date, about its price on some later date.  And so on, in an unending recursion, witthout ever reaching some fundamental  source of value.  (Unlike bitcoin, gold has a floor price determined by its demand as an engineering and decorative material; but it is much less than its current market price -- maybe 200 USD/oz or lower.)\n\nSo, gold is a lousy store of value, because there is no reason to expect that the mood of the traders and longer-term investors will remain unchanged for years.  Looking at the history of the last 10-20 years, it is obvious that the price was over-pumped by marketeers playing on FUD (like that of Zerohedge).  Over the next few years, the Gold price may do more crazy things, who knows; but it seems more likely to drop further than to rise again.  Investing in gold (like investing in bitcoin) is therefore a form of gambling, more than investing.\n\n> I forgot to mention remittances at all - which I think you touched on in reference to bank fees. I think there is potential in the remittance market as well. \n\nI doubt that any "rebittance" company has turned a profit yet.  The business has a problem with the "return flow": there is limited liquidity in the bitcoin market at the receiving country, so the coins sent by the rebittance company will saturate it.  That is, the coins that the company bought for 100 USD in the US will have to be sold for maybe 95 USD worth of the local currency in the receiving country.': 1, 'Luckily he does not need to develop it all alone... There are a lot of capable developers who want to see LN be built  ;-)': 1, 'Would you like to cut short a conversation with a Blockstream or LN developer?  Ask him a tough question, like\n\n1. Each payment channel needs at leat one on-chain transaction, that must lock up, for N days, enough bitcoins to cover all payments to be sent through the channel for those N days.  If the LN is supposed to carry 100 off-chain payments for each on-chain transaction, on average, then each payment channel must carry at least 100 payments, on average.  If Alice does 1 bitcoin payment per day, how many months of her salary would she have to lock up in advance, in the payment channel to her main hub?\n\n2.  Alice has her monthly salary locked up for 30 days in a payment channel to her main hub.  She tries to pay her rent through the hub, but the hub fails to deliver the payment and refuses to release her coins.  She has to wait for the channel timeout.  Will her landlord accept that as an excuse?\n\n3. A hundred consumers have locked up 10\'000 bitcoins in payment channels to a hub, all with a timeout on the same date.  Almost all those coins have been spent, for goods and services already received and consumed.  If the hub fails to issue the last "checks" of those cutormers to the bitcoin network before the channel\'s timeout date, all the coins will return to them.  How much would it cost for some hacker to do a spam attack that prevents the hub from closing the channels on time?  \n\n4. Alice locks 100 bitcoins for 1 month in a channel to a hub.  The hub must open payment channels to all the merchants and clients that Alice may want to send those coins to, and/or to further hubs.  How much bitcoin should the hub lock into each of those outgoing channels?  Where will those coins come from?  (They cannot be Alice\'s coins, right?)\n\n5.  Suppose that Alice, an LN client, has all her expendable bitcoins locked into LN payment channels.  When Alice need to make a payment to Bob, who is not an LN client, she must ask her hub to close her channel so that he regains control of her coins, then she must issue the on-chain transaction to Bob, and re-open the channel to her hub with the remainder.  (She could also ask her hub to send bitcoins to Bob on-chain, without closing her channel; but the hub would then have to lend bitcoins to her, until the channel\'s normal closing.) A similar situation occurs when Bob pays Alice, and Alice intends to spend those coins through the LN.   In both cases, a payment between an LN client and a non-LN client will require two on-chain transactions in addition to the payment itself.  So, by the time 30% of bitcoin users have migrated to LN, 9% of the payments (LN to LN, 30% x 30%) will require zero on-chain transactions, 49% (non-LN to non-LN, 70% x 70%) will require one on-chain transaction, and 42% (LN to non-LN and non-LN to LN, 2 times 30% times 70%) will require three on-chain transactions.  That is almost 2 on-chain transactions per payment, on average.  Which means that, while it is gathering clients, the LN will actually *increase* the load on the blochchain.  So, how do the LN developers intend to force all bitcoiners to become LN clients at the same time?\n\nThere is more, but it shoudl suffice for now.  Each of those questions has been tested with several Blockstream and LN devs, and ended the conversation each time.  ;D': 1, 'Wait, are you saying that the LN will achieve "mass adoption" by having the same 300\'000 users make 10\'000 micropayments per day, instead of 1 normal payment per day?': 1, 'Well, I pose you this: what *if* it does reach mainstream success?

It\'s not stock in a company (that produces anything), it\'s a scheme to lure in "greater fools" - yes? (FWIW my brother in law has argued that same point with me).

Gold, surprise surprise, has always been considered a secure store of value. My mother (who is educated for her generation) is not tech savvy. She is not tech illiterate either, she can operate her smart phone and send/receive SMS/email etc. I tried explaining bitcoin to her and she was baffled, I dumbed it down, still baffled. I tried a different approach: mentionoed scarcity, fixed supply, "mining", and it being outside of the whims of central banks/governments and she immediately said "ah! like gold!". Her generation (and following gens) have simply just attributed value to gold simply "because". I am not saying these people are right or wrong, but I\'m saying that because there\'s just a strong belief in gold being "valuable" - it has become so. I honestly don\'t see gold collapsing anytime soon for this reason. Furthermore - I think some people would tend to see bitcoin as a digital equivalent. \n\nBut.. what do I know..\n\nEdit: I forgot to mention remittances at all - which I think you touched on in reference to bank fees. I think there is potential in the remittance market as well. Although, that could technically work the same at $1,000/btc or $1/btc. It\'s a fast, instant, "email of money" kind of transfer system in my eyes. I have sent over $10k USD in bitcoin across the world instantly and had it confirm within 10 minutes, for.. pennies. But this doesn\'t speak to the value of bitcoin, more-so the protocol. However, if remittances are to be an area of potential success, wouldn\'t bitcoin have to have SOME value attributed to it?

This would just be a different way to use bitcoin when a "on blockchain" transactions would be overkill and inefficient.\n\n\n> 10\'000 bitcoins in payment channels to a hub, all with a timeout on the same date\n\nSeems the timeouts would naturally fall at different times / days and could easily be adjusted to do more on-chain settlement transactions / delay new payment channels if needed to improve cashflow on the hub if needed.\n\n\n> ...spam attack that prevents the hub from closing the channels on time...\n\nLarger transaction fee would prevent this. With better fee markets and / or software that ignores super-low-fee transactions this would be a non-issue as it would be easy to out-spend the "spam".  The LN settlement transactions would be high-value, so large transaction fees would be perfectly acceptable (and appropriate).\n\n\n> 100 off-chain payments for each on-chain transaction\n\nThe examples above (mobile phone pay-per-call or streaming video/ audio by the second) could handle thousands or millions of transactions per user via LN.  That is what would raise the average.  More importantly, the on-chain transaction fees would be negligible.  No blocksize increase will ever achieve this level of scalability and no custodian-wallet solution (Coinbase, etc) can match the cryptographic security it provides.\n\n\nIf your argument was that LN would be awkward if we deposit all of our income into it and then try to make on-chain payments, I agree ;-)\n\n\nEdit: typos, formatting and elaborated on # of off-chain translations calculation.': 1, "Luckily we're not even close to mass adoption yet.

Actually, it is a negative-sum game, like lottery tickets -- because mining burns each day close to 1 million USD of new investors money, that is not going to come back to them.  \n\nThe main economic effect of bitcoin has been to transfer at least half a billion dollars, perhaps more, from some pockets to other pockets.  Like any pyramid, it has already ruined many people, and severely hurt many others, financially and emotionally.   Sooner or later it has to collapse, and then tens of thousands more, at least, will realize that the money they though that they had invested was just thrown away.
