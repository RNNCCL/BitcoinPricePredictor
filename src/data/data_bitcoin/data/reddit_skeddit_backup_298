Yes they do so in apparent sense. You did not answer why "absolute" was important.\n\nI will give you two examples, one very accurate and another little vague.\n\nFirst the vague one.\n\nLet us say, me and you were connected with a connection transferring data at the speed of light & were playing a game real-time. Let\'s say we face delay in signal because the data transfer speed is greater than our move speeds. Now what do we do? We reduce the size of the data transferred. Even if we reduced them to really small move commands and that was not enough what next is left? Encode them into bits, and we cant go any smaller. Note that during this encoding we abstracted the data, by keeping some context at either end of gaming clients where they both agreed that certain bits meant certain move. If an animation involved several such moves we can further reduce the data size by clubbing them together and abstracting them. Thus using abstraction, and in a way preprocessing/caching, we were able to send more data over the same data size & speed without increasing the "actual" capacity of the connection. The internet uses the OSI model whose layers are abstraction on top of each other. LN is an abstraction on top of bitcoin where it does increase the capacity by abstraction of information.\n\nNow a practical example. \n\nA sends some coins to B and B sends all these coins to C. If we say after a period of time instead, that A had sent those coins to C, the definition of that coin remains intact and the blockchain had to bear one less transaction. This is known as \'transaction cut-through\' and forms the starting basis for LN. In this example the transaction A->C bore in itself more "meaning" than appears. We can draw an analogy to the same electrical signals that only used to denote the voice in a phone call, now denotes various kinds of data, not just audio, by abstracting the data either end, where each impulse of the signal now "means" more than just a moment of voice. We essentially sidechained the "Hello Hello"s indroduction to \'handshake protocols\'.': 2}, ("Bitcoin addresses aren't quite as random as I thought", 53): {"TLDR: There's 20B of random data in a Bitcoin address (since the second round of hashing uses RIPEMD-160).

There are smart people from all walks of life on this planet that are beginning to understand that Bitcoin is an immutable peer-to-peer network that can change the world in more ways than we can think of today. One day, the masses will wake up and be using Bitcoin without even knowing it.  They\'ll just be telling their friends and family about some awesome feature that some company\'s app or appliance can do now, and it just happens "magically" or "automatically" or "instantly".  The old world ways of conducting business, voting, commuting, researching, and even getting the latest news will all come crumbling down.  By this time, it will be too late for the mature, entrenched organizations to try to discover, mimic, or even implement "Blockchain tech" (without Bitcoin of course) and try to fold their old business model around such an unstoppable force that makes their entire existence obsolete.  The next generation is already hard at work building dozens of killer apps for Bitcoin and there is no turning back from this groundbreaking, proven, open-source network protocol that solves the "double spend" problem and is secured by more computing power than any organization or government has or could afford.  The cat is out of the bag and the only thing between here and the moon is time itself.  No one knows how long exactly, but relax and be patient.

Then I had to go explain the whole thing to several other people so they could review my design and code! I also explained it to my (non-cryptographer) partner many times as I worked it out. I learned which presentations and orderings made sense to people. I probably spent more time before the release explaining it than I did writing it! This put me in a good position to write a straightforward explanation, instead of a sea of juxtaposed algebra.  And my CT write-up was also peer reviewed by a half dozen people who\'d never heard of this stuff before then-- because I knew it was a new idea to people and it was critically important that people could feel comfortable it, and they helped me improve it further.\n\n[And fortunately, a lot of people found it interesting enough to actually spend time listening to me blather. This is often not true for scalability proposals.]\n\nI don\'t believe that this level of description development has yet been performed for Lightning.\n\nYou also couldn\'t really go implement CT from the paper; though it gives the central ideas it doesn\'t give the details Waxwing has a more complete description. There are many edge cases that I don\'t discuss because they\'re not critical to the basic understanding-- they make it fast, they make it flexible, etc.. I explained nothing of the deep magic that lets virtually all the proof payload care useful secret data.  My goal there was just to warm people up to this very alien and seemingly impossible concept, not to set them out to implement it.\n\nYou could say that Lightning is the logical conclusion of several different scaling threads that have been weaving through the Bitcoin space for some time.  If you take these things for granted then it\'s "obvious" and to me it seems very natural in general-- and I think much more intuitive than, say, a CoinSwap.  The basic features it uses are all intentional primitives in bitcoin and it uses them in ways that are not especially alien compared to CoinSwaps and micro-payment channels. I think that in the future when the software is mature and the descriptions are well developed it may well be hard to convince people that the design of Bitcoin wasn\'t specifically made to facilitate lightning exactly. But that is my belief, you can take it for whatever it\'s worth to you. :)\n\nThe proof will be in the pudding, when someone does go and spend time really making it clear.\n\nThat said, there really are things out there that are hairballs of edge cases-- some because that is just life, and some because they had a fundamentally unsound design that was \'fixed up\' with lots of patches. E.g. when the patching only stopped because the complexity exceeded the world\'s patience for reviewing, not (necessarily) when all the flaws were gone.

For comparison: "Think about what happens when you run out of cash in your wallet, you have to use another form of payment to fund it again (ie, go to an ATM, get a job)" Likewise for when you hit your credit limit, or your bank account the day before payday, etc.\n\nBut the thing that makes lightning **COOL** is that once you replace the hub-and-spoke banking system with a hub-and-spoke lightning system, you suddenly realise there\'s no actual limits on who gets to be a hub; you don\'t have to actually be a bank, you just have to be able to run a bitcoin node and the lightning software and trust it with some of your own bitcoins.  And then **BAM** nobody has to worry about delays signing up for a merchant account, nobody has to worry about chargebacks, you have enormous competition bidding transaction fees down, and maybe other nice things like censorship resistance or better privacy. Heck, if lightning works for everyday purchases, maybe it kills off consumer credit card debt.\n\n(Well, you know, all that if lightning actually turns out to *work*... There\'s still lots of hard problems before there\'s an implementation, etc)': 1, 'Thanks!

It might help the community understand it better.': 1, '"A bank account is simple, your employer pays to it, you spend from it" -- and you can do the same thing with a lightning channel. If your employer doesn\'t want to pay directly -- just like most employers won\'t pay you in bitcoin today -- do it yourself, and if you can, find someone who will let you automate it.\n\nThe hubs / routing nodes in the lightning network earn fees by sitting on funds, without incurring much risk; and the math seems to work out at giving a pretty reasonable rate of return at pretty low fee levels (10% pa at <1% per transaction). Add the fact you can close all your channels at any time and move your funds elsewhere, and that\'s a better deal than many investment opportunities, especially when interest rates are around 0%.\n\nPersonally, I don\'t think raw bitcoin works for consumer transactions because of confirmation delays (and the inherent risk in relying on zero-conf transactions). It\'s like accepting cheques over the counter; fine if there\'s really no alternative, but not knowing immediately if it\'s actually going to clear is still pretty painful.': 1, "We do want it, but in my opinion we don't **WANT** it.\n\nThe thing is, a transaction has to be broadcast to fund a payment channel in the lightning network before anything can happen. So what does this mean? Well, it really just means it's less useful/convenient for average users.\n\nYou can think of a payment channel as one of those re-loadable gift cards you buy for distant family members because you don't know what to get them for their birthdays. The card can be used to pay for things much quicker than other methods of payment, since it's just the company updating the balance on the card. They can also refund money to the card just as easily.\n\nSo why aren't we all using gift cards to pay for things? Well, for a couple reasons.\n\n1. Think about what happens when you run out of money on the gift card. You have to use another form of payment to fund it again (ie. post a transaction to the blockchain).\n2. The card is only good at one place (ie. one payment channel), meaning more than one card is required if you want to buy things from multiple stores.\n\nThe lightning network *sort of* fixes number two by allowing transactions to span multiple payment channels to get where they are going. Essentially your money can hop from Alice, to Bob, then Charlie. The problem still being that there has to be a route from Alice to Charlie, lest she have to create a new payment channel specifically for Charlie.\n\nThe lightning network is bad for people who just want to conveniently transfer value with no middlemen. What it would be good for, is optimizing the current banking system, which already operates in a hub and spoke like nature, with payment channels setup between clients accounts, and other institutions.\n\nMake no mistake, the lightning network is cool.

E.g. trades Bitcoin zero/low conf insecurity for delay risk, which I think most would agree is a good trade-off.  It also may reduce risk related to non-privacy, non-fungibility.\n\n> Transactions in lightning only require ? parties to know about them (I\'m assuming it\'s less then regular Bitcoin but I actually don\'t know).\n\n"Involved parties"-- the sender, the receiver, and some graph of variable size-- but presumably tiny compared to the user base\n\n> What if your target friend speaks a different language or there\'s no one-language-route to your friend? Then you can\'t use this method and you\'d have to fall back to the first method.\n\nIn that case you just don\'t get the scaling gain-- and you can also setup a channel there while making the payment, so that future transactions are more efficient-- and if there was a weak spot in the graph, you may well earn net fees after creating the channel as you carry transactions for others. It doesn\'t remove direct routing but rides atop it. \n\nThere are now several implementers working on it with early software... happen doesn\'t seem to have that much doubt. A greater question is how much will the efficiency gain actually be... and that depends a lot on how you assume bitcoin will be used in the future.': 9, ">Why is the first point any sort of a problem?\n\nBecause it's not convenient. Your example still proves my point. People often choose not to use cash due to the inconvenience of needing the cash on you. Also, you can't say having a job is equivalent adding funds to a payment channel. A job is required to have money at all, and is not really part of the issue. \n\nHitting your credit limit is sort of the same issue, as you have to add funds back to it, but credit accounts are convenient for other reasons (like being able to spend money you don't already have). Emptying your bank account is not at all the same issue, as there's no extra step after being paid to that account, or depositing a cheque.\n\nA bank account is simple, your employer pays to it, you spend from it. You *can* have different accounts for different things, but usually they are meant specifically for saving in some way, not for spending. If you have multiple, non-credit, accounts for spending, then you are likely an edge case with uncommon reasons for having things setup that way. Most people have a chequing account and a few savings accounts.\n\n>But the thing that makes lightning COOL is that once you replace the hub-and-spoke banking system with a hub-and-spoke lightning system, you suddenly realise there's no actual limits on who gets to be a hub\n\nI don't see why many people, or businesses, would want to be hubs.\n\n>nobody has to worry about delays signing up for a merchant account\n\nBitcoin does this already.\n\n>nobody has to worry about chargebacks\n\nBitcoin does this already.\n\n>you have enormous competition bidding transaction fees down\n\nYou wouldn't anymore than you do now. One of the benefits of the lightning network is that you don't have to worry about fees. They should actually increase when using the network itself.\n\n>nice things like censorship resistance or better privacy\n\nHow? I actually don't know if this is true or not, but off the top of my head I can't find any reason why this would be the case.

Everyone with the secret key can encrypt and decrypt the data. AES and Blowfish are two algorithms of this type. This kind of cryptography is mostly secure against quantum computers. They at best can effectively halve the key size. Since, today, for a proper symmetric cipher a key with a length of 128 bit is considered secure, in a world with quantum computers 256 bit keys should be fine. Most popular symmetric encryption algorithms, such as AES, already support or have variants with 256 bit keys.\n\nThe second is asymmetric cryptography. You have key pairs with a public and a private key. It is used for encryption, decryption and commonly signing messages. Examples of algorithms making use of this kind of cryptography are RSA, ElGamal and the elliptic curve types that are used in most cryptocurrencies. For the first two, secure key sizes are on the order of 2048 bits to 4096 bits. For ECC you are good at about 256 bits. All those three are also easily broken by quantum computers. Just increasing the key size won't save you, it will only make things slower for you without doing much for the quantum computer.\n\nHowever, there are already algorithms that do asymmetric crypto things and are resistant to quantum computers. They are slower, use bigger keys (although that is not the point) and introduce more overhead for messages.

This could happen if the server you connected to was itself not well connected or somehow dropped the transaction after you published it.\n\nTry saving the transaction ("Save" button, lower left).

Cointape indicates that you\'ll need to pay about 40 satoshis/byte to get next-block confirmation:\n\nhttp://www.cointape.com/\n\nEstimating based on your screenshot, the tx you sent looks like it paid only ~4 satoshis/byte. So it could be the fee was set too low. In that case your options are to wait (usually works, and the only option that should be used by a beginner), or try to unstick your transaction. More here:\n\nhttp://bitzuma.com/posts/how-to-clear-a-stuck-bitcoin-transaction/\n\nEdit2: Looks like Cointape just updated to a more reasonable-looking fee schedule.
