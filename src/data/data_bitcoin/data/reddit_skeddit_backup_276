Hence all the SFYL, the only consumer protection has been done voluntarily or by the community and not regulated (i.e you have to reverse that transaction i did by mistake etc)\n\n> money's value could just disappear\n\nYes it could, there have been several flash crashes and it's value has gone from $1 - $1200 and back to $230ish again. Unless you have taken adequate steps a HDD going bank or an exchange running off could wipe out your savings easier then a lost bank card would.\n\n": 0, 'The young people will make Bitcoin work.': 2, 'All you Bitcoin people are up to no good!\n\nBahah ah ah!': 1, '> "A virtual wallet.

Wow, shocking. A bitcoin wallet requires a password to it, AND i don't have banks playing with my money, so there's nothing I need protecting from\n\nApart from a HDD dying unless you took adequate steps before hand. I lose my bank card, no problem. I lose my private key, ooops\n\n> Anything you buy in cash and get a return on, I could also do the same for bitcoin\n\nBut this raises an interesting question do you get your return in BTC or USD. Ideally it should come back as BTC but a lot of places seem to be doing it in dollars so how do you protect yourself as both a company and a consumer against price volatility\n\n> except scammers and theft, which aren't unique to bitcoin \n\nNever said they were\n\n> Oh, and you get a wage slip, but the government doesn't know the serial number for every dollar you get paid with.\n\nNor do they need to but they can track bills when required through serials (the ole marked bill). Point is even paid cash that cash has a history going back through the businesses etc. However cash is dying out and direct account to account is even better to prove who paid what.\n\n> but less of a problem than credit cards in your name. \n\nWhich you assume is a problem for most people but it isn't. Look at the amount of people with store discount cards that do nothing but give away all your buying habits for a discount. Plus you have entered into a credit agreement and that in turn brings in a whole new load of consumer protection. Especially in the EU where they were even able to bitchslap Apple for there pathetic warranty policies\n\n> These problems aren't unique to bitcoin\n\nIndeed not but some are worse for example an exchange going belly up leaves you with nothing, a bank has deposits guaranteed etc. A pc mess up could wipe it out, a house fire could take out your PC and backup private key etc.\n\nBitcoin is great for it's small niche but is not ready for prime time. I mean imagine you get paid BTC, you try to convert as little as possible and spend direct and when it comes to pay your taxes the price nose dives. They can see you got say $3000/month worth of btc but now you only have $2500\\month equivalent but have to meet the tax demand of the higher rate (of course in fairness it could go the other way and you make money).\n": 1, "You didn't know there are negative sides to Bitcoin?

Subsequent to doing this their hashrate raised for months.   The main force for their hashrate decline wasn't even people migrating off, but was things like shunting hashrate to other pools and ultimately the rise of hashrate in china diluting ghash's concentration.\n\nSo you had a pool which had, objectively, the lowest profits of any well known one-- who performed a successful finny attack, and stole 1000 BTC from a Bitcoin user, and then subsequently rose to >50% hashpower... These are the facts.\n\nI too used to argue that users would just move if a pool misbehaved, but this has been clearly disproved in this incident as well as many others. For example, 50BTC simply stopped paying people and-- in spite of much yelling-- still retained substantial hashrate for many months. This is doubly true now that so much of the hashpower is industrial mining by the pools or associated entities themselves.

Ireland averages 5.8 GW of electric consumption.  Antminer S7, which are new mining devices, can run the current network hash rate for 110 MW.  If we assume the average existing mining hardware is half as efficient, we get 220 MW for the entire network.  \n\nAlternately, as a first approximation, we can estimate that miners as a whole don't spend more on electricity than the mining rewards are worth.  The rewards are 25 btc x ~$240/btc x 6 block per hour, or $36,000 per hour.  At a wholesale price of $0.05/kWh, we then get 720,000 kWh/h = 720,000 kW = 720 MW.  That's an upper bound.  If you factor in a profit margin and the discounted life of the mining hardware ($4500 to $10,000/hr), they can probably not expend more than half that power, giving 360 MW.  \n\nSplitting the estimates we get 290 MW, which is less than Ireland by a factor of 20.  It's roughly the power used by the urban area of Cork, Ireland's second largest city.  Critics of bitcoin's power use always seem to forget that the reward drops in half every 4 years, which means so does the income from mining, aside from price variation.

I\'d also expect the attack wouldn\'t work every time since they would have to issue an identical transaction once MtGox issued theirs and was a race condition on which transaction would enter the blockchain. \n\n\nSo for these coins you\'d expect MtGox should have become aware of this hack very quickly and knew exactly who was doing it based on their financial controls.  (Historical records would also point the finger at the culprit too).  It\'s likely this wasn\'t the only issue in MtGox by the sounds of reddit reports.  There was potentially also embezzlement, intentional or not, and if the customer funds were stored with the company\'s own funds they\'re likely spent due to Gox\'s operating costs.\n\nSo for those coins it\'s not even clear which ones were \'stolen\' since they were legitimately signed by MtGox\'s wallet to another address.  If true, in time it\'s likely to be identified but only MtGox staff with their records could answer this.\n\n\nOnce real bitcoin enter the blockchain now we\'re into the realm of the public paper trail.\nChasing coins through the blockchain is difficult when mixers are involved, especially fixed size mixers and if the thief knows what they\'re doing.  Every mixer simply dilutes the coin\'s history so it becomes a probability game on where the funds went.  The more clients and even the mixing the harder it can be to follow for relatively small amounts.\n\n\nThe most likely reason to catch someone post mixing is probably due to a sidechannel give away such as the timings, the mixer is actually run by someone wanting to track people, spending habits of the resulting coins (like going straight to a russian crypto exchange post mixing) or association with other coins.  At the moment this isn\'t a science but the tools are getting better.\n\n\nUltimately tracing the coins is a costly (in person hours) exercise so only when it\'s of significant interest will they be followed up on.\nIn some ways this is a good thing as it makes the default "innocent until proven guilty" approach even though it feels wrong when people can see the coins should belong to someone else.  Anyhow I think MtGox will eventually be explained but while it\'s still in the process of examination I doubt we\'ll hear the details of precisely which transactions are responsible.\n\n\nIn summary... the coins are most likely no longer in the attackers wallet and in general circulation as part of the bitcoin ecosystem otherwise the thief is simply sitting on them in various addresses until they want to move them in the years to come.  \n\nEither way the coins still most certainly exist on the blockchain somewhere ;)': 2, 'The answers the blockchain gives are as numerous as the unspent outputs derived from the hack spends themselves.

The nodes check the digital signature of the transaction, and if the sending addresses had enough funds to send.  The memory pool includes time received, keeping transactions in order until put in a block.  When a new block arrives, the included transactions get removed from the memory pool, so it maintains roughly a constant size.\n\nSo funds can be sent in another transaction as soon as the network relays the previous one (typically ~10 seconds), but it then contains "unconfirmed inputs" until the previous transaction is in a block.  There is a small chance the previous transaction will never get in a block, stranding the later one.  If the previous transaction has no unconfirmed inputs and a proper fee, it is unlikely to never get in a block and you can reasonably safely spend it.

The scale effect of legalizing prostitution, i.e. expansion of the market, outweighs the substitution effect, where legal sex workers are favored over illegal workers. On average, countries with legalized prostitution report a greater incidence of human trafficking inflows. \n\n> * The effect of legal prostitution on human trafficking inflows is stronger in high-income countries than middle-income countries. Because trafficking for the purpose of sexual exploitation requires that clients in a potential destination country have sufficient purchasing power, domestic supply acts as a constraint. \n\n> * Criminalization of prostitution in Sweden resulted in the shrinking of the prostitution market and the decline of human trafficking inflows. Cross-country comparisons of Sweden with Denmark (where prostitution is decriminalized) and Germany (expanded legalization of prostitution) are consistent with the quantitative analysis, showing that trafficking inflows decreased with criminalization and increased with legalization. \n\n> * The type of legalization of prostitution does not matter \xe2\x80\x94 it only matters whether prostitution is legal or not. Whether third-party involvement (persons who facilitate the prostitution businesses, i.e, \xe2\x80\x9cpimps\xe2\x80\x9d) is allowed or not does not have an effect on human trafficking inflows into a country. Legalization of prostitution itself is more important in explaining human trafficking than the type of legalization. \n\n> * Democracies have a higher probability of increased human-trafficking inflows than non-democratic countries. There is a 13.4% higher probability of receiving higher inflows in a democratic country than otherwise.\n\nWhen you start telling people it's okay to pay for sex, the customers don't go out of their way to figure out if the prostitute is really doing it willingly, and now you've just exponentially expanded the human trafficking market.": 7, 'QE4Ever!!!!!!': 4, 'Done https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3ncat3/why_bitcoin_will_inevitably_be_the_backbone_of/': 2, 'Thank you, ok I will do that :) ': 1, 'This is an extremely interesting yet easy to understand explanation of why Bitcoin is unequivocally a better way of handling this inter-bank transfer spaghetti mess.  \n\nYou should summarize and post this gem:\n\n> Consumers are demanding cheaper and faster international transfers **but some small regional bank in India does not have agreements with a bank in spain or the US.
