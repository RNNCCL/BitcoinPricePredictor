It means that the initial fee can use a lower \xe2\x80\x9cmost likely\xe2\x80\x9d estimate instead of having to over-pay \xe2\x80\x9cjust in case\xe2\x80\x9d; this results in lower fees even when replacements are rarely made.": 3, 'RBF as a concept isn\'t all that great, no matter what form it takes.

I myself have designed, written, and deployed software that is at the core of huge systems authorizing billions of dollars of payments (Eligibility Determination in a couple of states).   I'm no cryptographer, true enough.  But the issues really at the core of this discussion are not cryptography centric; there are no arguments I am aware of about the cryptography here.\n\nYour comments about LN are difficult to parse.  The real value of LN is in routing payments across the network, not just between two nodes you manage.\n\nYour discussion about Coinbase fees is also silly.  If their advantage now is 5 to 10 cents, and fees go up to 10 or 20 cents, they certainly get the head room for free transactions between customers, and 5 to 10 cents (cheaper, see?) when going out of network.

You really can't do that, as you have to accept the blocks mined or leave Bitcoin.  No, I have been working for nearly two years on Factom as a solution that can secure arbitrary amounts of data against Bitcoin's proof of work for a fixed overhead to Bitcoin of less than 13 mb per year.  \n\nFor example, a good guy put out some Entry Credits for Factom for free on Reddit.  We saw that most people wouldn't have the tech or savey to make use of them, so we deployed some Java code to make entries with those credits.   Some attacker grabbed our code and dumped 30 mb of cuss words into Factom and burned all the Entry Credits.  Net increase in overhead to Bitcoin?  0 bytes.   We did our 144 transactions like we do every day, and the Merkle trees ate the rest.\n\nSo there are solutions to all of this, and there are people working to solve problems.

First, we provide the first systematic analysis of the impact of broken primitives on Bitcoin. While the Bitcoin community has considered some high-level cases, we perform a fine-grained systematic analysis. We do this by identifying the core cryptographic building blocks within Bitcoin and consider the various ways in which such primitives are broken in practice. We analyze both the failure of individual primitive properties, and combinations of broken primitives, and highlight their impact on the main security properties of Bitcoin.  \n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, we describe in detail the range of consequences different breaks have. For example, one interesting and counter-intuitive result is that an adversary with access to a simple pre-image oracle does not gain an advantage for mining by just working on the block header. However, with a few calls, the adversary can use the flexibility of the coinbase transaction and succeed in mining the next block with high probability.  \n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, our investigations raise concerns about the currently specified migration plans for Bitcoin. Although the current plans are a first step in the right direction, we show that they are both overly conservative in some respects, as well as inadequate in others. For example, it is not clear that if someone owns a Bitcoin now, they will still have access to it in a year, if a primitive has broken in the meantime.  \n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a tangential fourth contribution, we introduce an oracle model for hash functions that unifies several existing types of breakage and allows us to specify forms of hash function breakage that are closer to real-world attacks.\n\n*This* is why Bitcoin will prevail; Bitcoin's open, debatable architecture is to the academic mind like a flame to the moth; regardless of your purpose, it will consume you, and grow ever brighter.": 3}}, '02-24-2016': {("Anyone know how to contact GetGems support?

Gold's utility is derived from two things:\n\n1) Use in electronics, chemistry, jewelry/ornamentation etc.\n\n2) People speculating that in the event of an economic meltdown gold will play a larger roll in the money supply. Either from people trading for it directly, central banks acquiring it in their reserves, etc.\n\n\nBitcoin's does not have #1. Therefore 100% of it's current value is derived from investors speculating that it will be demanded in exchange in the future. If bitcoin does not become actively traded for goods and services (or the various 2.0 uses \xe2\x80\x95 colored coins, etc) then it's value will drop to near zero as the anticipated demand will not have materialized. Ironically your call for it to be an asset that just sits there and holds value is precisely what will cause the value to tank. \n\n> Payment Network: I want payment networks to be done on higher layers on the Blockchain.

When you say "some archival tier of the network", you seem to be describing a future not where a person storing some *data* in the OP_RETURN might have difficulty accessing their data, but simply someone with a paper wallet having difficulty spending their bitcoins. Can you be more specific?': 1, "> If I can conduct my business with 99.999999999999999999% certainty that everything is correct\n\nWell isn't that a different security assumption altogether? That's the assumption where, by random chance due to latencies (not attack), the blockchain won't be reorganised starting from genesis (or whatever far-gone point). Which is a probability that is impressively close to 100% as soon as 10 blocks deep.\n\nThe security assumption that would erode, is that instead of trusting *only* the genesis block hash, you'd be trusting some other block hash in the future (whether by checkpoint/UTXO snapshot, or dynamic, as can be made possible with headers-first and UTXO commitments)\n\nWhether we can reasonably allow for this assumption to wither a bit? Probably at least maybe. But, undeniably, scaling based on this erosion being acceptable changes an expectation people may have made in the past that they could always sync from the start, and begin anew from scratch.\n\nFurther, in being unable to validate from scratch due to prohibitive complexity of such a task, you can never be fully objective toward *all* of the past; your objectivity stops from the moment you start trusting that one hash; you stop trusting the genesis hash, representative of a state of the block chain when there was literally no monetary stake inside it - and instead start trusting the conglomerate of nodes and miners that were there at the time, presumably all having monetary stake in it, and, with it, a reason to lie. Your perspective is all of the sudden forced to be subjective.\n\nRemind you of anything? Because that same perspective is what a PoS block chain, inevitably, is.\n\nSo, whether *that's* fine.. Probably at least maybe ;) But I doubt I wanna explore this with Bitcoin.": 4, "> This is simple fundamental fact for any block chain unless you're willing to erode your security assumptions (ie. by making the assumption long-past PoW is 'good enough', and skipping validation)\n\nAnd why not?\n\nIf I can conduct my business with 99.999999999999999999% certainty that everything is correct, then I don't give a fuck about not having a completely verified record. In fact, it would be a waste of resources to get that extra little, marginal certainty.\n\nMore to the point, Bitcoin cannot ever give you 100% certainty; Bitcoin has shown us that Truth is merely a probability that approaches 100% with time, but never reaches it.\n\nUnless we embrace this fundamental fact, we are in danger of attempting to solve a problem that is much harder than the problem we actually have.\n\n-----------\n\nOn a related note, the Bitcoin network is fundamentally *NOT* a timeless record.\n\nI suspect that people will begin to accept\xe2\x80\x94perhaps without realizing it\xe2\x80\x94that the purpose of Bitcoin is *not* to store for all time a globally recognized record, but rather to provide means by which to calculate the *probability* that some piece of data (*e.g.,* a transaction) will remain for all time as part of such a record.\n\nYou don't need the entire record in order to calculate a probability that is sufficiently high for your purposes\xe2\x80\x94hence pruning. Indeed, the subjectivity of sufficiency opens up that calculation to market forces; you can keep the necessary data yourself, or you can pay someone else to keep the necessary data for you, etc.\n\nIn the end, all you will be able to do is calculate with sufficiently high probability that you did indeed include some data in what will *likely* be chosen as the timeless record (consider that out of all blocks, the genesis block has the highest probability of remaining in the record, and the latest block has the lowest probability of remaining in the record). However, because nobody necessarily cares about your data, you yourself are going to have to maintain (or later purchase a copy of) the data that is necessary to make that calculation.\n\nMore concretely: If you stuff your coins into the cryptographic equivalent of a buried shoebox for half a century, then there should be no reasonable expectation that the network at large will bother to keep the necessary information at the ready just in case you decide to dig them up; you'd better be ready to provide the details yourself, or wait for some archival tier of the network to handle your request.": 3, "Usually when you start progress is much faster because there are few transactions in DB and contents can be cached in memory.

If you had you would realize that I am saying that the people in charge of the future of Bitcoin ie: core developers, miners- need to make a decision about its future before a government comes in and creates their own digital currency that will have the same characteristics as Bitcoin but accepted by governments worldwide. Mass adoption only happens when the majority accepts. If the social majority lose faith in Bitcoin before mass adoption then Bitcoin dies and some other most likely government backed digital currency will survive. Just loving decentralization and not understanding how our world and society works makes you ignorant to what has to really happen in order for great creations like Bitcoin to survive.
