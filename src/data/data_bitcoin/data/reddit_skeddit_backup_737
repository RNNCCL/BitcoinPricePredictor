You don't want to buy a PC now, because it's too expensive. So you defer the purchase into the future where the same PC costs only half of today, or you'll get a PC twice as good for the same amount of money.\n\nSo theoretically keeping the PC example: You think, well... I'm not going to buy a PC now, which costs about 1 ounce of gold, or 18.97 USD, I'm going to wait a hundred years. Suddenly, you not only can buy 2.6 times more PCs for the same amount of gold, or the accounted for inflation amount of USD, you also get a 1'000'000 times better PC. Of course the increase in purchasing power relative to a good is almost nowhere as drastic as in the computing sector, but still, overall production increases.\n\nThis is, in my opinion, an important factor when you think about stuff like this: The inflation is only *one* aspect of how the money loses purchasing power. The fact that ever less valuable money drives you to earlier consumption robs you today of the better goods you might have bought in the future with that saved money. Missed opportunities due to malinvestment driven by an artificially low price on money due to inflation, loss of capital and time, the fact that I'm typing this and not something valuable instead and so on is a whole world of stolen prosperity on top of that. Then add the endless wars, only possible through inflation, the destruction of capital in wars, to loss of human life, who might have been *the guy who cures cancer* or whatnot.\n\nThis is where I fall, figuratively, on my knees and thank Satoshi Nakamoto from the bottom of my heart for giving us this tool, this opportunity to *finally* separate money from the state.

The bitcoin protocol and the Bitcoin Core client currently don't contain any mechanisms to hide a node's activities on the network and it's debatable whether or not the suggestions provided here should be implemented. They could be, not too hard to add delays to transaction propagation, or even lowering the connected nodes, but these measures do affect the time it takes for transactions to saturate in the entire network, which can affect double spend attempts.\n\nRotating the nonce (to protect against the NAT related 'identity' leak) would help (although I'm not entirely sure how the nonce is generated in Bitcoin Core) and rotating through connections helps too. The last one was also mentioned in the paper, but I don't think that tying in the frequency of sent transactions to the connection life span is smart. It's another piece of information that can be analyzed (nodes with short lived connections -> must be sending lost of transactions). \n\nAnyway, if you check the bitcoin-dev mailing list, the focus is mostly on the TOR related weaknesses because there you *do* expect some measure of anonymity when sending transactions, and that's the interesting problem... :)": 2, 'Interesting paper.

The locking feature in Counterparty does not enforce scarcity of an asset. It enforces scarcity of tokens with a particular name.

': 5, 'As opposed to "colored coins"? Coinprism is the main colored coins implementation as of today.': 1, '> Checkpointing means centralization.\n\nNo. The Counterparty checkpoints are very different than Bitcoin/alt-coin checkpoints because anyone can recompute them; they are an optimization rather than a security measure. Basically whereas in Bitcoin a checkpoint means "Regardless of what the actual blockchain is, this is the One True Blockchain, so reject re-organizations that try to change that", in Counterparty a checkpoint means "If a block has this hash, I claim that the consensus state (asset blances) are this, so if you trust me you can skip laborously re-computing all that info yourself."\n\nIt\'s perfectly OK if different Counterparty implementations/clients use different checkpoints, or none at all. If different Bitcoin/alt-coin clients use different checkpoints the consensus breaks the moment there is a re-organization.\n\nIncidentally, it\'s been proposed that Bitcoin clients use Counterparty-style checkpoints before for the UTXO set: you\'d calculate what the UTXO set should be at some blockhash, invite everyone to double-check the calculation themselves, and if everyone agrees anyone who trusts that the hash was in fact calculated correctly can skip calculating the UTXO set themselves.\n\nedit: Actually, I should have checked the sourcecode: they *aren\'t* shipping Counterparty with asset balances, so the checkpoints are purely an *assertion statement* to make sure you\'re computer calculated everything correctly, as you can [see here](https://github.com/CounterpartyXCP/counterpartyd/blob/master/lib/blocks.py#L135).\n\nedit2: I know people are going to ask, so why does Bitcoin Core have checkpoints? Basically because of a DoS vulnerability when you\'re starting up a new node, and in addition, Bitcoin Core doesn\'t actually check signatures prior to a checkpoint to speed things up. Fortunately it\'s a relatively theoretical issue, as a reorg big enough to make checkpoints matter would be at minimum a week or so long - we always set them fairly far back every release - which would *very* likely destroy all trust in Bitcoin anyway. This is completely unlike so many alt-coins that use very frequently updated checkpoints, often automatically updated, as a way to get around the fact that they\'re insecure due to 51% attacks.': 6, "Depends on what you want to do.
