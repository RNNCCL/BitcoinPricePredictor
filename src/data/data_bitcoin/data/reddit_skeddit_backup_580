I agree with you it\'s more of a confidence problem than a technical one, and you\'re right that such an attack has limits on what can be done (can\'t steal coins, can block transactions etc). The one nitpick I have is your description sounds a bit like it\'s a one way line which can\'t be crossed, or game over. That\'s not necessarily the case. \n\nThe arbitration in Bitcoin is done by the miners, by majority of hashing power, but it\'s all based on probability. Someone owning more lottery tickets has greater chance of winning than someone owning fewer, but that doesn\'t mean the minority holder can\'t win, including repeatedly. It\'s possible for the "honest" network to continue winning blocks for a while without majority hashing power, meaning a 51% attack would fail so long as the honest side was "lucky". It\'s termed 51% attack because that\'s the obvious point at which the honest network is in probability more vulnerable. However, mining "defenders" lying dormant waiting to spring to life in network defense could also diminish the effectiveness of an attack. It\'s because of these dynamics there is no hard 51% line over which we  reach certain disaster, and conversely 51% isn\'t the minimum threshold where we might feel concerned. It\'s more that we\'re fuzzy near these edges about the blocks more recently piling onto the chain. The deeper in the blockchain a transaction lives, the more confidence in its security. As long as the hashing algorithm held (SHA256 in Bitcoin\'s case) a 51% wouldn\'t mean much for deep transactions. People could suspend transactions temporarily and or wait for far greater number of confirmations, until things were sorted out.\n\nAlso, remember there are a lot of very technical people interested in the integrity and protection of the network. When legitimate miner GHash.io began reaching 51% the community objected vociferously, and some began attacking them with DDoS. GHash.io eventually relented and self-limited themselves.\n\nNext, on governments attacking Bitcoin. You have to imagine ways they might try:\n\n1. Criminalize it\n2. Invest money in trying to disrupt it\n\nCriminalizing it needs to be justified while other countries embrace it. Governments so tyrannical might have larger tensions than only over currency. At most it would be driven underground within such regimes with people technically savvy enough to use it surreptitiously continuing to do so (imagine the large drug market).\n\nGovernments might try investing in enough hashing power to disrupt the network, but such a large undertaking would likely be noticed and publicized, meaning dangerous political backlash. Compromising the hashing algorithm is also unlikely, and even if successful not detrimental as the community could switch to another algorithm, including one based simply on factoring large primes. Governments cannot ultimately win with brute force against math.': 2, '...uh, and why is this a bad thing? Perhaps you\'re being sarcastic.

Then when individual mining became less profitable, he started a cloud mining service. (There were always questions about whether or not his miners actually existed.) Then, when that became less profitable, he said that he was going to start a new coin which would be stable and widely accepted, and offered people the chance to convert their BTC mining contracts into contracts to mine this new coin. He said it would have a $20 floor backed by a $100 million fund (of whose existence there is no evidence), and would be accepted by a bunch of major retailers including Amazon, Walmart, etc. (who have since denied having any plans to accept the coin.)\n\nSurprise, surprise: when the coin (Paycoin) came out, Garza tried to maintain the $20 floor for a couple of minutes, but then it began its long plunge down. (It's now worth about a dollar; why it's worth anything at all is a mystery.) He then promised a buyback program, whereby people could put their Paycoins in escrow for an unspecified period of time and (eventually) get $20 back. But there were never any details about this program and its terms, and when the signup date arrived, he put it on hold indefinitely.\n\nMeanwhile, he suspended all cloud mining without warning or explanation, and a bunch of his staff has left. No one seems to be developing the coin, and his attempts to add features have been laughable. (The best was when he tried to add the ability to buy gift cards; people who had been waiting to have *any* use for their Paycoins bought a bunch, and because all their coins were suddenly being sold for BTC in order to buy the gift cards, the price crashed to about a penny, and the gift card program was suspended indefinitely.) \n\nAlso, there have been reports (e.g. in Coinfire) that he's being investigated by the SEC. Also also, there turned out to be several staking wallets, controlled by GAW, which were staking at a much higher rate than everyone else's (350%, but much higher due to compounding.) Coins from these wallets moved to the exchanges last week; there was an uproar, and GAW claims to have destroyed them, but as always, it's not at all clear that this is true.\n\nHashtalk, the GAW forum, used to be full of people who struck me as delusional; I just checked back there, and it's a ghost town. \n\nThe mystery, to me, is who is propping up the coin's value. It should be nearly zero (not actually zero only because I suppose it might have a curiosity value, like those trillion dollar Zimbabwean bills.)

No further details have been released, but interesting high-profile innovations in the Bitcoin space include the "programmable money" technology of Ethereum and the "sidechains" of Blockstream, which recently received $21 million seed funding.\n\nIn a recent interview, Byrne said that Overstock is building the platform that will let companies issue a crypto-equity, which is a new frontier with many legal obstacles.

You probably wouldn't feel comfortable having $10,000 worth of cash sitting under your mattress. Most people put that kind of money into a bank. But if you are your own bank, you'd want to put that kind of money into a big fireproof safe.\n\nCold storage is like having that fireproof safe. You must protect your private bitcoin key with absolute care, because if anyone else ever finds it then they can unlock your safe immediately and quickly steal your bitcoins. Since computers connected to the internet are more easily compromised by malware and hackers, having your private key touch a computer that is connected to the internet means the real possibility of losing all the bitcoin that key unlocks.\n\nSo how do you send bitcoin without an internet connection? Sounds impossible, right? Bitcoin is a technology that operates on the internet, so that private key must touch a computer that is connected to the internet at some point in order to send bitcoin, yes? Actually, no!\n\nInstead you can use an offline computer that has your private key to sign the transaction. Signing is a cryptographic mathematical algorithm that proves you own a private key without actually revealing what the private key is, and therefore not compromising the key\\*. Then all you need to do is take that signature you generated on the offline computer and use the online computer to broadcast that generated signature.\n\n\\*Well actually that's not entirely true. There are some vulnerabilities in ~~ECMA~~ ECDSA (mixed up my alphabet soup lingo, sorry) encryption that make it possible to guess a private key the more you sign with that same key. The solution is to only want to sign with a single private key once, then never again, which means you must spend all the coins in that address and have the change go to a new address and private key.\n\nYes, this process is not quick and easy, but that is the cost of high security.

Having made that decision, he would then transact with other nodes on the same fork as himself.  \n\nNew blocks would be mined on two different blockchain forks by two different sets of miners.  Newly mined blocks and the coins generated by them would be considered invalid by users whose software preferred the other fork, because those coins would not exist on the other (forked) blockchain.  \n\nFor example, if the blockchain fork happened at block 100, then there would be two different block 101s, one for each chain.

Users would chose to use the version of software that added a checkpoint at block 101 of their preferred fork.\n\nI don't think anyone really knows how a major hard fork would play out socioeconomically.  This is all new ground.  Would users around the world follow the big merchants and exchanges even if they all adopted a more restrictive, US government approved version of 'Bitcoin' that allowed a cabal to stop your payments, freeze your funds, and arbitrarily create money?  In my opinion it is unclear what the user incentive would be to accept such a change.  The reason for Bitcoin to exist is that it lacks any central authority who can dictate such things.  The only party to benefit from such central control is the party doing the central control.

If Bitcoin is allowed to become centralized, then it can no longer be trusted to function like real money, and therefore it ceases to be useful.\n\nThe moment some theoretical future coalition of miners tried to change the code they are running to make it more restrictive, the rest of the network would split off and the price of coins on the restrictive coalition fork would plummet through the floor.  The coalition would have to decide if they wanted to mine their own worthless coin, or rejoin the original Bitcoin network running the original code.  The whole point of Bitcoin is that no one can restrict transactions or otherwise control other people's money.  Bitcoin is valuable because *no one else can turn off your money*.  If miners collude, that feature disappears and the coalition has to be trusted just like any bank. It becomes necessary for users to fork to another network that is decentralized, and that is exactly what users who value that functionality would do.

In conclusion: very easily.\n\nA proof-of-concept implementation (&amp; documentation) is available here:\n\nhttps://github.com/basil00/PseudoNode\n\nTo the network, PseudoNode appears to be a normal full node. It relays invs, txs, blocks, etc. just like a full node. In reality, PseudoNode is a type of p2p proxy server. It merely forwards any request it cannot handle (getdata, getheaders, etc.) to neighboring nodes. For more information see the above links.\n\nPseudoNode uses no disk (no blockchain download required), uses little CPU/RAM, and uses less network resources (bandwidth) than a normal full node. A PseudoNode can "sync" with the network within seconds.\n\nPseudoNode demonstrates some of the problems with incentivized full nodes (including the "Bitnodes Incentive Program"). It is difficult to prove that a full node is really a full node.\n\nThe implementation mostly has novelty/proof-of-concept value. It is not intended to be "production" software.\nAnd the FAQ:\n\nDoes PseudoNode harm the network?\n\nShort answer: No.\n\nLong answer: Not unless the number of PseudoNodes significantly overwhelms the number of normal full nodes. Otherwise, if PseudoNode can connect to at least some good nodes (default 2), then will PseudoNode will acts just like a normal node and contributes network bandwidth.\n\nCan PseudoNode cause the network to fork?\n\nNo, PseudoNode just follows what other nodes are doing.\n\nCan PseudoNode steal coins?\n\nNo.\n\nCan PseudoNodes be banned from the network?\n\nNot easily.

As you can imagine, Bitcoin\xe2\x80\x99s volatile downtrend has put us in a difficult situation and we have been hard at work resolving payout concerns. To help us remain on track, we have decided to roll out support for the mining of additional cryptocurrencies - namely the ASIC resistant coins. Similar to a multi-pool, this will enable us to target the most profitable coins and maximize revenue for all parties.\n>  \n> In anticipation of this change, we will slowly begin to restructure our platform and phase out obsolete contracts. A combination of rising network difficulty and competition are beginning to render many of our introductory contracts futile. While those with recent purchases will continue to receive earnings, the Demo, Starter, and Pilot contracts will eventually be phased out and replaced with variable contracts.\n>  \n> Following our next platform update, earnings from existing contract plans will be revamped to more accurately reflect Bitcoin\xe2\x80\x99s current price. Furthermore, solo-mined earnings will be restricted for use only with contract purchases.\n>  \n> We do want to emphasize that our team understands the frustration and inconveniences these recent changes may pose. Cryptocurrency mining is an unpredictable business with many risks. We do ask our users to remain aware of these risks and approach the industry with reason. As a mining service provider, we are caught in the midst of the recent economic turbulence and have little recourse outside of our recent platform changes. Despite the inconveniences, we are confident our plan of action moving forward is greatly preferable than those of our competitors.\n>  \n> We thank you for your continued understanding during these difficult times.\n>  \n> Sincerely,\n> CoIntellect Staff": 1, '[MyCoinProject](http://mycoinproject.com/) is purportedly a blog of an Englishman documenting his [1500 Euro investment with CoinTellect](http://mycoinproject.com/2015/01/19/episode-2-1500-euro-invested/) (why not GBP?

After all, it's much easier to regulate your competitors out of existence then actually innovate.\n\n> Net neutrality is necessary for users to send encrypted packets and new protocols.\n\nWrong again.

Are you really this deluded or just shilling for the government? I can't tell.\n\nhttp://www.networkworld.com/article/2848131/security0/encrypt-everything-urges-internet-architecture-board.html\n\nRemember, it's the government that we find always standing in opposition to encryption:\n\nhttp://time.com/3437222/iphone-data-encryption/\n\nBut no worries.

Since YouTube and Netflix came out, that cheating has been exposed.  If they got rid of net neutrality, they could continue cheating by charging a lot more for "10 Mb/s including videos" versus "10 Mb/s with email and twitter only".  If net neutrality is preserved, they would be obliged to really deliver 10 Mb/s sustained, if they sold "10 Mb/s".\n\n> Blocking encrypted traffic would be a terrible result, but it begs the question why it isn\'t occurring right now? ISPs have stayed neutral based on consumer preferences so far\n\nThe telcos have stayed neutral because the principle of net neutrality is still in force.

Like it happens now with TV channels and cable companies.\n\nIf net neutrality falls, the telcos will reject encrypted packets, precisely because encryption would let users avoid deep packet inspection and discrimination by content and service, which is the whole point of their fight against net neutrality.': 0, "> In particular, without net neutrality, telcos would be free to overcharge or block encrypted packets, Tor traffic, bitcoin traffic, etc.\n\nAnd with so called net neutrality through government regulation, now governments can set fixed prices (driving away subscribers that can't afford it), levy taxes on service, pass additional laws to require that ISPs block illegal downloads, encrypted packets, Tor traffic, bitcoin traffic, etc.\n\nThe cure is worse than the supposed disease.\n\nIs **this** who you want regulating speech on the internet via their control of ISPs? I think not.\n\nhttp://www.fcc.gov/guides/obscenity-indecency-and-profanity": -1, '> The telcos have stayed neutral because the principle of net neutrality is still in force.\nI don\'t believe this is correct. The D.C.

Net neutrality is not legal right now, which is why the FCC is being pressed to implement new rules & it has developed into such a public issue.\n\nThe issue of selling "speeds up to10mbps" to 10 users fed by a single 20mbps line is more a case of potentially misleading advertisement. But it reflects how internet service is provided, from main conduits rather than direct lines to the provider (at least for cable). This tech background means that an ISP cannot guarantee a given bandwidth without underutilizing its capital (e.g., sell 10 1-mbps connections on a line with a maximum capacity of 10mbps). Differential pricing is one way to pass the cost of consuming additional content on to consumers, rather than spread that cost out to all consumers. [Which ISPs aren\'t doing anyway because it is not popular to do so. To the argument that they are just waiting, I would respond that we can have the net neutrality discussion again at that time. Precautionary regulation unnecessarily preempts new business models that could conceivably be even better for consumers.]\n\nA key flaw in net neutrality is that it disincentivizes companys from building out content delivery networks or entering into preferential deals even if they feel that their traffic is important enough to pay an additional amount. If an MMO gaming company wants to prioritize its content as it flows to consumers, it could not do so under net neutrality. The unintended consequences of this regulation could decrease the quality of many applications of the internet for only a theoretical corresponding benefit.

If an MMO gaming company wants to prioritize its content as it flows to consumers, it could not do so under net neutrality.\n\nThat is exactly why net neutrality is important.  If a carrier signs such a preferential service deal with a specific provider,  that provider will have an essential monopoly in the area served by that carrier.  Other providers of equivalent content will be effectively shut off from those clients, and unable to compete with the favored provider.  The latter can then charge monopoly prices for its service, which of course will be much higher than the free market prices.  Both the telco and the favored provider will win; the customers and competitors will lose.\n\n> I don't believe this is correct. The D.C.

Net neutrality is not legal right now, which is why the FCC is being pressed to implement new rules & it has developed into such a public issue.\n\nNet neutrality has been the rule since the internet started, and it allowed the internet service market grow as it did.  It allowed VOIP services like Skype break through the telco monopolies on telephone service and avoid their outrageous long distance call tariffs, for example.\n\nThe telcos have long battled against net neutrality because they (like the feudal lords of 500 years ago) want the power to run and concede monopolies on internet services, which are always more lucrative than free markets, even providing inferior service.  Last January the telcos won a court battle against the FCC on a technicality, and struck net neutrality down.  The FCC has been trying to plug that legal hole.  \n\nBy the way, the FCC was trying to enforce attempt to enforce **non**discrimination.": 1, "I would much rather the telcos compete on that aspect as well. I'm not sure if the barriers to entry aren't too high & the industry full of cludge for that to happen, but 80% of US households have access to 2+ providers at 10mbps, so I'm willing to give it a shot.\n\nWhen YouTube and Netflix use a combined 47% of the US downstream, you could say that they (and users) are exacting a cost on other internet users, a form of pollution if you like. Should the market have the opportunity to pass these costs along to the producers(and consumers of Netflix), or distribute them widely among all Internet consumers? [Perhaps the market will choose not to discriminate, as it has done so thus far, in response to consumer demand.]\n\nBlocking encrypted traffic would be a terrible result, but it begs the question why it isn't occurring right now? ISPs have stayed neutral based on consumer preferences so far, and there's not much reason to think drastic changes will occur. Net neutrality generally includes exceptions for traffic that is illegal, malicious & unwanted, so the telcos (or the FCC, or another 3-letter agency) could still block suspicious encrypted traffic on a whim.": 1, "Ugh, this is the telcos' spiel...\n\nNet neutrality means ensuring that the internet remains a free market.  The telcos want it to be a monopoly: your internet access provider has the right to know which sites and services you are using, and charge fees, degrade, or block services accordingly.  \n\nIn particular, **without** net neutrality, telcos  would be free to overcharge or block encrypted packets, Tor traffic, bitcoin traffic, etc.": 12, "I see that the telcos are succeeding in turning people's head upside down with their blatant disinformation campaign.  \n\nAll those things that you wrote is precisely what the telcos want to do, and will be able to do if the net is not neutral.  \n\nNet neutrality is about what the **telcos** can and cannot do.  It does not gove the government any extra apower to regulate, tax, or censor the internet (which it can do anyway, with or witjhout neutrality).  On the contrary, by allowing arbitrary data packets it makes censorship and control by governments (and by telcos) more difficult.  Net neutrality prohibits **telcos** from blocking, censoring, charging extra fees depending on service, etc..\n\nNet neutrality has nothing to do with the government fixing prices.  It means **pricing must be independent of which data you send and which service you access**  Telcos can still compete, like today, to provide better prices and/or more Mb/s. \n\nNet neutrality is **necessary** for users to send encrypted packets and new protocols.  Without net neutrality, the telcos will immediately block encrypted packets, because the whole point of ending net neutrality is that they want to know what services you are accessing, and of course they cannot do that if the packets are encrypted or you are using some new protocol.\n\nDon't bee fooled...": 1, '>  that provider will have an essential monopoly in the area served by that carrier. \n\nIf you\'re arguing against exclusive dealing agreements, then this still belongs in the realm of the FTC AND DoJ\'s Antitrust Division rather than FCC regulation.

The alias is believed to be about a million bitcoin - at most, they have been worth about 8 billion Swedish crowns, today they are worth around 2 billion - but Bitcoins creator has no power over the network or currency. The system is structured in a way that no decision on the currency can have any effect without a majority of the users themselves go with them.\n\n- And there is a transparent system, all transactions are recorded in the public logbook, says Robin Teigland.\n\nIn practice, a system bitcoin several advantages compared to a regular value. In an increasingly globalized economy there is a need to be able to make small, simple, safe and affordable payments over the world, says Robin Teigland.\n\n- With traditional currencies are micropayments, for example, difficult to do. It\'s hard for me to send money to another part of the world without the cost and delay. In many parts of the world, people have no access to bank accounts, and also there is a problem to solve.\n\nWhether right bitcoin is the answer remains to be seen, says Robin Teigland.\n\n- There are other solutions than bitcoin on the problems, and there are other crypto currencies. Many argue that perhaps we will land on three or four different crypto currencies eventually.\n\nBTC\n\nis the currency abbreviation of bitcoin\n\nThe most interesting aspect of bitcoin is not the currency itself. It is most bitcoinentusiaster agree. The revolutionary is the technology behind, block chains that enables secure transactions of data, but there is no parent control body - not a government agency, government or bank that registers and keeps order. It may not sound so spectacular, but some visionaries believe the technology could eventually change the Internet basically - perhaps even the whole society.\n\nBritish Daily Telegraph, published in June, an article in which the newspaper\'s technology editor Matthew Sparkes called bitcoin for "gateway to an upcoming Digital Anarchy" and painted a possible future with driverless taxis on the streets and a sky full of stray drones who supply goods. A science fiction dystopia, or -utopi, depending on how you look at it.\n\nSparkes vision is sharp and exaggerated, but not wholly unfounded. Blockkedjetekniken actually has some revolutionary potential. A block chain requires not only contain information about bitcoin, but can accommodate all kinds of data. Who owns a car, who controls a domain name online, who is entitled to vote in an election - information that can be secured and recorded by the network itself, without official interference. Even now going different types of non-monetary data transactions free ride on bitcoinkedjan or similar blocks chains, and in the future there could be even more. In an article on bitcoinsajten Coindesk explains, for example, the artist DA Wallach how blockkedjetekniken could revolutionize the music industry, by acting as a single, central and open database of who has rights to the music.\n\nIt would theoretically be able to move the entire music industry\'s economy to a crypto-currency system. Each song, artist and author could have its own bitcoinpl\xc3\xa5nbok. Each time the song is played on Spotify, for example, a micro-payment to the song\'s wallet, then the system automatically split the sum of all the authors who are connected to the song. Quickly, automatically and without any expensive and large administration system.\n\nBitcoinr\xc3\xb6relsen is very much influenced by ideology, or perhaps ideologies. Blockkedjetekniken is a libertarian wet dream, an internet anarchist utopia. The built decentralized democratic system is attractive for many. And the question of whether a bitcoinekonomi is compatible with a socialist society is debated on the Internet - Bitcoin is at least one possible way to demolish the existing capitalist system, if only to replace it with a new one.\n\nClich\xc3\xa9 of whom a bitcoinanv\xc3\xa4ndare is does appear to be quite true: He is on average 32.1 years old libertarian party, according to a study conducted at University College London. When the US newspaper Huffington Post wrote about the study in February last year, shortly after the exchange rate temporarily crashed into the ground, he made headline: "Bitcoin is apparently a rich, white, male disaster". But Lui Smyth, who is behind the study, developed his ideas in a long blog post shortly thereafter, and pointed out then that it is much more than just libertarianism behind the movement. It reflects a deep skepticism towards banks and stock exchanges, it was born in the wake of a major economic crisis and is based on a more general distrust of the current economic order. In the years since Bitcoins birth, the number googlingar the phrase "what is money?" Doubled.\n\nSome who thought a lot about Bitcoins influence of ideology and activism is the artist group Mediengruppe BITNIK. On November 14, delivered the Swiss postal service a padded white envelope Kunsthalle St. Gallen in Switzerland. Inside the envelope was a DVD case with a small square foil vacuum packing, and the film was a plastic bag with ten yellow ecstasy tablets. They are now part of Mediengruppe Bitniks artwork "Random darknet shopper (2014)". The art gallery in Sankt Gallen was in fact the whole winter a robot and bought random goods on the Internet underground world, "darknet" or "the \'deep web\'.\n': 36, 'Cool article, thanks for posting.': 6, "You don't say": 0, 'Can you get a picture of the infographic?

It gives a lot.\n\nAll is not gold and green forests in bitcoinbranschen. In the months after our visit to Constance piling up complaints against KNC Miner. In addition to running his own bitcoingruva, so they sell also mining equipment, computers specially designed for people to be able to dig for gold at home. And customers are dissatisfied: they mean that deliveries of two of mineralization models have been slow. KNC Miner has not agreed to repurchase. In early February, goes around fifty people together for a class action submitted to the district court, which calls for SEK 10.5 million of KNC Miner. Moreover, a further 15 individual lawsuits against KNC Miner submitted by Joakim Strignert on Juristfirma your right.\n\n- The KNC has done is to sell expensive machines for mining of crypto-currencies online, it has paid in advance and promised a specific delivery date. Since it has not been able to deliver on the date, says Joakim Strignert.\n\nAccording to Joakim Strignert argue customers that machines are not performing as promised, are flammable and does not meet the security requirements for electronics, such as CE marking.\n\n- You deny individuals their consumer rights. It refuses to accept the repurchase or sending money back. These are up to 70 000 per machine, some have bought two or three, maybe borrow to afford.\n\nThe case is complicated in that it involves just a crypto-currency. Delay in the delivery means not only that customers have to wait - Weekly machine can not be used also means a potential loss of income in bitcoin. And according to Joakim Strignert says most of his clients to KNC Miner deliberately deceived them.\n\n- The incentive to create great products and deliver on time is low when at the same time competing with their customers. It takes in advances from customers, produces chips, but instead of sending the equipment goes chips into their own computer center. You have cheated the customers with unrealistic delivery date, taking into interest-free credit and let customers pay for a new mega data centers. What we see here might be one of the biggest scams, says Joakim Strignert.\n\nKNC Miner itself does not agree Strignerts description. In a written statement from the KNC\'s legal department says it:\n\n"We have not built anything \'for clients\' money\'. Different parts of the KNC Group is engaged in various kinds of activities, which are financed on a commercial basis, with both venture capital surplus from its own operations. "\n\nAs regards the delivery of products, you write:\n\n"Our customers want, like us, stay in the forefront of this development. Order often occurs when a product just is fully developed and before the entire production process can be surveyed, therefore we are careful to explain that the delivery date is uncertain. Our view is that we kept our promises. "\n\nAnd concerning the equipment would not meet safety, writes KNC that it\'s about customers who have used Peripheral fault the quality or capacity.\n\nPerhaps Bitcoins very nature - there are so many aspects of and driving forces behind the currency, ideology and capital confused - one reason why there are conflicts in the Great bitcoingruvbrytarf\xc3\xb6retagen.\n\n- It\'s really a lot of talk and high noises on the forums on the web on this subject, says Nanok Bie is "futurist" on KNC Miner, which means that he works with market analysis and product development\n\n- But if you read what Satoshi Nakamoto wrote, it is very clear that he predicted exactly this: first comes home computers to mine, then specialized hardware, then great facilities. This is Satoshi Nakamotos own future plan, it harmonizes with his original idea. There is a misconception that kryptovalutorna would be driven by idealism, but the system needs a lot of power to operate.\n\nBasically involves lawsuits about money, says Nanok Bie.\n\n- People want money. We sell machines that make money. Everyone wants money, what are they otherwise for motivation? And they will do almost anything to get money.\n\nThere one can apply on KNC Miner well.\n\n- It is a commercial industry. What should we do, shut down the company? Clearly you work for success. And we do not drown in money it costs to build it here, says Nanok Bie.\n\nThe little art project in the Kunsthalle St. Gallen has not ended happily. When the exhibition closed on January 11 came Swiss police and seized robot acted ecstasy of bitcoin on the Darknet, as well as goods. The artists behind the work writes in a statement on his website: "What does it mean for a society when there are robots acting autonomously? Who is responsible when a robot breaks the law on their own initiative? "Whether someone will be prosecuted for drug purchase is not yet clear. But the questions Art Group sets are relevant, and crypto-currencies is part of the reason why they are so difficult to answer. Whose money is it that bought ecstasy? Can you determine the ownership of a bitcoinpl\xc3\xa5nbok, if there is a robot that handles it?\n\nIn some countries, crypto-currencies banned completely, including Iceland and Vietnam. In China, for example, it is prohibited for financial institutions and banks to deal with the crypto-currencies. But elsewhere, bitcoin is being established at the usual regulated financial market. In January, bitcoinf\xc3\xb6retaget Coinbase America\'s first licensed bitcoinb\xc3\xb6rs, with support from the New York Stock Exchange. The company Gemini has also drawn in once what it calls a "totally controlled" bitcoinb\xc3\xb6rs in New York.\n\nSam Cole, who is president of KNC Miner supports the development and believe that bitcoinvalutan will stabilize as a result of the new regulated exchanges. The current low rate may be because people are waiting for safe and sustainable exchange services to use, after crashes Mt Gox disaster.\n\n- Some customers do not trust the options available, and it does not help that the sites have had security holes. With the regulated stock markets, we believe that the course will stabilize and perhaps increase, says Sam Cole.\n\nAnarchists currency may therefore require some regulation to work and become stable. But how much a part of society and the existing economic system can kryptovalutorna be, without also losing all his points? It is contradictory, just like most things related to bitcoin.\n\nHow it goes for the empty airplane hangar area in Boden, and with the municipality\'s confidence in the data center and bitcoingruvor, is uncertain. The grass and slyet on the airfield perhaps may continue to sway desolate. KNC Miner looking at alternatives in Finland. Where electricity is cheaper, and if Sweden does not lower the tax on energy for data centers so is considering moving the entire operation across the border. It takes a lot of power to create money out of nothing.\n\nHow Bitcoins:\n\nAnyone using bitcoin must have a bitcoinpl\xc3\xa5nbok, a special software to their computer or mobile phone. All wallets are paired in a large network.\nWhen a transaction is carried out - bitcoin changes hands - the information is sent out to the network. The latest transactions are grouped together in a block.\nEveryone who is on the network can, if they wish, choose to act as "miners" miners. This means that the grant computing power to perform calculations for the network.\nTo block transactions to be verified, have a mineral find the right solution to a problem. Simply put, it\'s about finding a series of numbers that match the block. All the miners who are on the network starts to work on solving the problem.\nWhen the problem is resolved verified the block. Each block contains information about the previous block, and they together form a long chain. It becomes a public cash book of all transactions ever made in bitcoinsystemet. A new block formed roughly every ten minutes.\nThe miner who has time to first find the solution, get a reward in the form of new bitcoin. It is the only way to create new bitcoin system. Right now, the reward is 25 bitcoin, but the sum will decrease gradually and eventually become zero, and instead replaced by voluntary transaction fees.': 22, 'Holds bitcoingruvan in Boden key to an idealistic future, or one of the biggest scams?

The large doors open out to the parking lot and the old empty airfield, now overgrown with grass and shrubbery. Fans are mounted on the roof and in the aisles, but we sweat when we go along endless rows of storage shelves in metal where processors are neatly lined up and produce heat. It\'s August, and here in the hangar, the company KNC Miner during the first eight months of 2014 created the equivalent of 200 million out of nothing. Or, rather, electricity and enormous processing power.\n\nJust beside the hangar is another big room where Avtar Singh and his five colleagues, leased from a company in Stockholm, installing new custom built computers, miners. Five of them are originally from India, one from Peru. Right now flowing Indian music from the speakers.\n\n- But occasionally we run a Peruvian song to be fair, says Avtar Singh and laughs.\n\nAvtar Singh and his colleagues are here temporarily to mount, but usually works 25 people full time in bitcoingruvan in Boden.

It\'s fast decisions into action.\n\n- You can improvise sometimes. I have been forced to Clas Ohlson and buy hubs. I think they had nine. It was not enough so far.\n\nWhat is happening here, in the long hyllraderna in bitcoingruvan in Boden, is not easy to understand. And it is also not without controversy - in the months following the visit of Constance will now KNC Miner be strongly criticized.\n\nThe story of bitcoin begins in 2008. Then came a document up on the internet, signed Satoshi Nakamoto, who in detail described how to technically could create a so-called crypto-currency - a complete economic system built on digital money. The following year released the same mysterious signature on the first bitcoinprogramvaran, and the very first bitcoinen was conceived.\n\nWho Satoshi Nakamoto is, nobody knows. Many have speculated: is it a solitary genius, a group, a secret government conspiracy? Exactly why Satoshi Nakamoto created bitcoin is also impossible to know. But there are many interesting aspects of crypto currencies - both practical and ideological. You can use bitcoin in much the same way as ordinary money: buy things for them, transfer them between accounts, invest in them. But while ordinary currencies central controlled in one way or another - national banks decide over inflation and deflation, and transfers go through credit card companies, banks or companies like Paypal - this is a crypto-currency totally unguided.\n\n- The first thing I always say is that one must learn to think differently: it is a "person-to-person" -valuta, says Robin Teigland, who is an associate professor at the Stockholm School of Economics and researches crypto currencies.\n\nWhen I asked her to explain bitcoin as easy as possible she laughs a little Supplied before she attempts to unravel the hard grip only in a fully digital economy.\n\n- It can be difficult for people to understand that bitcoin is not associated with any government or central bank. There are no third party, there\'s only network, says Robin Teigland.\n\nThe network is the most important thing to grasp if one wants to understand bitcoin. Anyone who owns bitcoin need a special software, a bitcoinpl\xc3\xa5nbok. All wallets worldwide are connected to a large network, and each time bitcoin change ownership information is sent out to everyone on the network. The network gathers regularly together the latest transactions in a group, a "block". Each block formed refers back to the previous block, in a long chain. Block chain thus contains all information about all bitcointransaktioner ever performed.\n\nIt is here bitcoingruvan in Boden comes into the picture. All processors on the hyllraderna in the hangar working to try to create new blocks to the chain. Each time the network has gathered a bunch of new transactions - every ten minutes - launched a kind of contest, where all the bitcoinn\xc3\xa4tverket can participate. Simplified one can say that the contest is to solve a deliberately difficult problem that requires a lot of computing power. Anyone who has time to first create the new block, and get a reward. The reward consists of bitcoin, and it is the only way to create new bitcoin. This is what is known as mining or mining - a metaphor for digging in a mine, where computing power is the excavators and bitcoinbel\xc3\xb6ningen is gold.\n\n': 64, "It's actually quite cool.\nhttp://s17.postimg.org/k9h4gmf1b/IMG_1596.jpg": 26, "internal bitcoin transfers don't require bitcoin at all.

This weekend organized market Bitcoin funfair at K\xc3\xa4gelbanan in Stockholm, where visitors will switch to the $ 100 in bitcoin to buy things of the exhibitors - artists, designers, artists and bitcoinf\xc3\xb6retag. The market is sponsored by Bitcenter, a newly bitcoinpl\xc3\xa5nboksapp, and organized by the magazine and communication agency The Forumist.\n\n- I myself believe very much in bitcoin, it is interesting from a longer-term policy perspective, says Pejman Biroun of evaporation, which is the chief editor at The Forumist.\n\nWith the market wants to bring out the bitcoin to a wider audience. And Pejman Biroun Vand describes the collaboration as a "win-win" situation, where exhibitors and bitcoinf\xc3\xb6retaget both serve at the meeting.\n\nBitcoinv\xc3\xa4rlden need someone who can help them find the right match, the right personalities that can be seen in their context. A common bitcoinevent is otherwise pretty boring. There is only techies collected.\n\nHow small and marginal bitcoinekonomin is, it is the eminently already present in the community. Swedish police have been forced to learn how to manage Bitcoin when the currency seized in criminal investigations. The tax authorities have been forced to decide how to value added tax the trade of bitcoin, in a case that is now up in the European Court of Justice and will be determined during the year. And companies engaged in mining affects the economy in small communities Constance.\n\nErik Svensson is CEO at Boden development, a municipal corporation that works to promote growth in Boden, including by helping companies establish themselves. It\'s Boden development which leases the helicopter hangar which is now full of KNC\'s bitcoinminers, and Erik Svensson was one of those who had the first meetings with KNC just over a year ago.\n\n- There has not been a straightforward journey, to understand what this is. A lot has happened in a year.\n\nErik Svensson had heard about bitcoin, he says, but did not know how it worked. The representatives of the KNC explained, drew up the technology on a whiteboard.\n\n- I began to understand more and more. I have worked with the company since 1977, helped finance things, but never anything like that. We asked ourselves: how is this to be done, how it works, how do we do to cover up the risk?\n\nWhat are the risks concerned about yourselves?\n\n- Is there still a couple of years, we will get paid? It was such issues that were last fall. But that\'s history now.\n\nNow Boden development on the train. It has been discussed ideas: Maybe you can start accepting bitcoin payment of the entire business center Create Boden, the hotel and conference facility? Erik Svensson and his colleagues have even acquired their own bitcoinpl\xc3\xa5nb\xc3\xb6cker.\n\n- Yes, we bought a few dollars each, so that you know what it is, says Erik Svensson.\n\nAnother bitcoinf\xc3\xb6retag has established itself in Constance, British Hydro 66 who rents a small local a few hundred meters from the KNC\'s giant hangar. When we are there in August stands there only a few lonely shelves with processors. Christian Keet, who is visiting from London to look for the little mine, says that it is mostly an experiment so far. But he praises the local authority - it has been extremely helpful, he says.\n\nThe approximately 30 employees at KNC does not sound like many new jobs for the municipality. But synergies are significantly larger, says Erik Svensson.\n\n- It is from that they hire an electrician for lunch places they visit, construction companies and ventilation firms and security companies who receive assignments. It\'s all around you.\n\nIn the area around the hangars works about a hundred people now, according to Erik Svensson. And they would love that more data center establishes itself in Constance. There is land; the old airfield is empty and desolate. This past year, he and his colleagues visited fairs and presented itself for many companies in bitcoin- and data center industry. The problem is the energy. The supply of power control, and it is limited.\n': 26, 'Indeed.  Those greedy bastards can go to hell.  ': 4, 'Wow, awesome work.

I didn't do any editing.": 1, '\nThe robot got a veckolig budget of bitcoin. What it bought had no control over, not even the artists themselves. Among the other goods which have been delivered to the gallery are a couple of Nike shoes, a spy camera mounted in a black cap, a credit card ("ALL MY CARDS ARE FRESH, NOT SOLD Twice"), a DVD box with all the "Lord of the Rings "movies and a bunch of keys that were promised to be from the fire department and have main keys to a number of public stores and locations.\n\nPeople buy drugs online, not only on "the \'deep web\'. This is the reality. But it is not the only thing people do - they communicate well. "Random darknet shopper" is about how to build trust in the network is encrypted and anonymous, on how to establish identity and trust in market places, says the artists Carmen Weisskop and Domagoj Smoljo when we talk via Skype.\n\nThe artist group works with many types of internet issues and has previously made an installation of monitoring. Bitcoin is a small part of their art, but the currency is interesting, they say.\n\n- The utopian narrative about bitcoin is rather trite. But it is true that there is much more potential in the technology than just as a substitute for money. It is interesting when money stops being in the hands of states and governments and becomes something that people can create, and there have been many utopian projects around the artists and activists. Bitcoin has the potential to show that money is not an absolute, and I think that bitcoin already have a subversive potential, says Domagoj Smoljo.\n\n- Bitcoin can get people to think about money and capital in a new way - even people who themselves never owned a bitcoin.\n\nFor artists and creators can bitcoin also mean something good, says Domagoj Smoljo and Carmen Weisskop. It will be easier to pay and donate to cultural projects.\n\n- As it looks now online, where everyone is dependent on the credit card or Paypal, can any organization restrict the movements of any reason. One can exclude people, freeze Paypal accounts. Bitcoin is a secure economic system that is distributed among the users, it is a much more direct transaction without some big companies as intermediaries. The decentralization of it is really interesting, says Domagoj Smoljo and Carmen Weisskop.\n\n"Random darknet Shopper 2014" is interesting also because it pinpoints how the public learned to see the bitcoin: as something which is mainly used for shady transactions online, drug trafficking and weapons violations and money laundering. It is in such contexts currency mainly mentioned in the media - SvD Business, for example, called bitcoin for "bandit currency" (30 July 2013). And it is true that it is part of its allure for some. Or as Robin Teigland at the School explains, there are several different parallel movements and forces that are working for bitcoinekonomin. The ideological embossed libertarianerna who want to overthrow the central banks, the more practically oriented who wants to make it easier and more efficient to quickly pay someone on the other side of the world, and so are those who use Bitcoin, and other crypto currencies for trading in illegal goods and services.\n\n- One can not ignore them - they are also, and it\'s a great motivator, says Robin Teigland.\n\nAnd there are more objections to bitcoin. The currency is unstable and the course has changed a lot and quickly. Right now is a bitcoin worth about 1800 Swedish kronor, which most have been there five times the value. Confidence in bitcoinb\xc3\xb6rser and switching sites has fallen after the great Mt Gox crash. Bitcoinb\xc3\xb6rsen Mt Gox was one of the largest in the world, and for a period in 2013 they handled 70 percent of all bitcoinv\xc3\xa4xlingar in the world. But in February last year shut down suddenly, filed for bankruptcy and announced that 850,000 bitcoin (with the then exchange rate corresponded to about three billion) was gone. It was both clients\' money and the company\'s own disappeared, gone forever - from people\'s wallets and from bitcoinekonomin. A few months later found the Mt Gox about a quarter of the lost money in an old bitcoinpl\xc3\xa5nbok from 2011 - much like a traditional company would find a billion in an old plastic bag in someone\'s mattress. Exactly what happened with Mt Gox is still unclear: theft, fraud, mismanagement of the company or a combination of all.\n\nSome also believe that bitcoinekonomin in fact, compared to a pyramid scheme or Ponzi scheme, in which early investors earn big money but those who do not withdraw before the system collapses become big losers. The American economist Nouriel Roubini, formerly the United States Department of the Treasury, is one of those who commented maximum critical of bitcoin and called the system a scam. Estonian central bank has also warned of bitcoin.\n\nBut it\'s pretty clear that bitcoinekonomin not meet the definitions of a Ponzi scheme. Any return promised not. There is no central protagonist or organization in the middle of the system, no owner. The system is also inherently transparent - even if it requires some technical pre-understanding to be able to grab it. Early investors may have made big money and some late investors have lost. But any conscious hoax, it is probably not a question, says Robin Teigland.\n\n- If you look at how many people are connected to the network today, so it\'s hard to believe that it was the point. Anyone who makes the assessment has not been fully appreciated, and do not understand blockkedjetekniken and that it is the network that control. To take control of bitcoin have to take control of a very large amount of nodes [communicating devices] in the network, and it is not realistic. Maybe in the beginning, but not now. There are too many who are on the network. I am the Network! says Robin Teigland.\n\nThe European Banking Authority EBA and the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority, FI, went in December 2013 issued a warning to consumers about the risks of virtual currencies that bitcoin. The warning is still adhered to, says Lars Malmstr\xc3\xb6m, who is Head of Consumer contact on FI.\n\n- If you as a consumer chooses to use bitcoin must know that there is no common framework around it and no central issuer. And invests it in bitcoin, they can go up and down in value. A blank, car or dog is something substantial, but bitcoin has no substance but the value is based solely on supply and demand, says Lars Malmstr\xc3\xb6m.\n\nThis summer a new report by the EBA, which also takes up the risks to the financial system at large. Virtual currencies facilitates crime and terrorism, writes, among other things. Virtual currencies are not dependent on "units against which economic sanctions and embargoes can be done", which means that states and international organizations have no control over them. And if you do not regulate virtual currencies it will be "an uneven market for payment services" - in other words, currencies bitcoin outrank banks as regards transactions.\n\nThe EBA has however decided to defer to investigate the possible regulation; kryptovalutorna is still so small.\n\n- It would require a very extensive rulemaking for a phenomenon which is certainly growing, but not yet widespread. So they have chosen not to proceed with a common regulatory framework right now, but merely urged financial companies that do not have, to buy or sell virtual currencies. You do not want the virtual currencies in the financial system, says Lars Malmstr\xc3\xb6m.\n\nHow would a regulatory framework look like?\n\n- It is virtually impossible to answer. I doubt if it would be totally prohibitive. If you look at how they have regulated the financial sector and companies, so you need a permit to operate in the financial market. It\'s not an unreasonable guess that would restrict certain parts of the virtual currencies.\n\nBut who exactly is it they should regulate? There\'s no business or authority responsible for bitcoin.\n\n- Yes, that\'s a good question. Bitcoin is not by definition a value. It is not e-money. It is not a payment. Here there has been a development that does not fit into the regulations that exist, says Lars Malmstr\xc3\xb6m.\n\nYes, it\'s complicated. The authorities have not yet defined bitcoin and the other kryptovalutorna: Are they a commodity or is the money? Unregulated or not, so it is quite possible that as a private individual use bitcoin for small purchases in everyday life now. That companies Webhallen and some Swedish VPN and hosting services accept bitcoin is perhaps not surprising, but one can also go to the chiropractor, get their floors sanded or nails done for bitcoin. Or float in a large tank full of salt water, which the Options Health in central Stockholm where co-owner and floating therapist Rune Eriksson took the initiative to accept payment in bitcoin.\n\n- It is primarily interested in new technologies and new ways to market itself as the reason. Since it belongs to our philosophy that floatcenter to look beyond the ordinary in our society, finding new solutions to problems, says Rune Eriksson.\n\nIn particular, many are not as exercised the option to pay with bitcoin. A handful, less than ten, says Rune Eriksson.\n\n': 27, 'Yo mang just use google chrome. Then right click anywhere on the page and hit translate.\n': 1, "True.
