If these were powerful computers, then the supply of bitcoins would increase in the short term (price falls) until the difficulty adjustment (price reversion). The number of people as a number by itself, is only relevant with regard to transaction volume they might generate, not to mining speed (price unchanged).\n\n- Everyone would need to mine individually, because if everyone mined in a pool, then either fees would eat up all of the coins, or there would be immediate scalability issues with 1 billion transactions per block to split the proceeds, that will overwhelm the network, as the current infrastructure cannot cope with so many small transactions (price would go to zero with pools).\n\n- Assuming these people don\'t actually spend their coins, or off-chain services take a sufficient load off the network, the current software infrastructure would continue to work. There will probably be some fraction of bitcoins for everyone (if mining individually, some people might not get any directly), but a lot would be eaten up in fees like in the legacy banking system today (fees rise, demand falls, price falls).\n\n- If all this causes excessive transaction volume, the network will be destroyed, demand will drop and the price will fall to zero. If transaction volume does not become an issue, and assuming supply and demand remain otherwise constant, the price will stay the same or rise as existing mining investors may choose to purchase the coins that they had previously expected to mine, but now someone else will mine.\n\n': 5, 'The Bitcoin tip for 974 bits ($0.25) has been collected by *5tu*.\n\n\n--\n\n[^^what ^^is ^^ChangeTip?](https://www.reddit.com/r/changetip/wiki/tipping-on-reddit)': 1, 'True.

"It is a distributed protocol" can be a line of defense, let\'s see whether it works.\n\n>If you have a relatively small number of server, owners of those servers might be pressured into removing data, and you might be pressured into disconnecting servers which didn\'t. (E.g. blacklist/whitelist in code.)\n\nFactom will have 32 federated servers (which each serve as leaders for a portion of the chains), and 32 audit servers which are prepared to replace any of the federated servers that may go down or fail.\n\n On top of these servers, any Factom node that holds the data can do so, and the data will validate. So removing the data from Factom can\'t be done by simply removing the data from even the core 64 servers.\n\nServers are elected via delegated proof of use (built off private keys that hold entry credits) so they are not under our control. \n\n\n>> Factom is designed such that missing entry data doesn\'t stop the validation and verification (timestamping, order, blockchain proofs) of data in Factom.\n\n>Well then it is just timestamping and blockchain proofs, and that is many orders of magnitude cheaper than storing data... The article is correct.\n\nFactom is cheaper than the Bitcoin blockchain by 10x or more, and 1000x more expensive than simple cloud storage, as the article points out, if you don\'t care about securing your data against the blockchain.\n\n\n': 1, "The author also appears to misunderstand Bitcoin: if you're not auditing the Bitcoin blockchain you're trusting someone else to do so on your behalf.

What you seem to miss here is that the reason for that is one system of record has no way to validate another system of record without introducing trust.\n\nHere for the first time one can build a universal system of record where multiple parties can establish consensus with out introducing trust. The comments you are making comparing distributed ledgers to centralized alternatives on a cost basis seem to indicate you don't value that aspect very highly.\n\nSecond, core misunderstanding of Factom.\n\nThe price of the entry credits is not fixed at 0.1 pennies. The conversation rate of Factoids to Entry credits is dynamic and set by a vote of the Federated Servers. The cost must be high enough to prevent spam, but low enough to offer a cost competitive advantage over placing entries directly into the bitcoin blockchain for example. \n\nIf the costs were as low in Factom as in a central database then spam attacks would be common and so there must be a meaningful cost to placing an entry in a distributed ledger. If the costs are too high than usage will be lower, this is a balance the Federated Servers will have to determine based on the market and real world usage of the Factom system.": 3, "OK, [it looks like Factom doesn't really really guarantee that the data will be preserved](http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/31b98w/factom_is_an_expensive_data_store/cq0r94c).\n\nSo it might be just a very expensive way to timestamp data. :)": 1, "Storing data is very different from preserving data forever.\n\nWhen you publish your data on a service like Factom, you give up control -- you can no longer modify and delete it. And this is very important for audit purposes.\n\nSo this kind of a service is very different from Amazon S3 and things like that.\n\nSuppose you keep your audit logs in Amazon S3... Then a rogue admin steals bitcoins and erases all databases, backups and logs. Now what?\n\nObviously, you need to make sure that logs can't be simply erased. So either you need to build highly redundant infrastructure... or use a service which is specialized in this.\n\nObviously, it's going to cost more than your usual cloud storage, because you pay for high redundancy (not just multiple nodes, but multiple _independently controlled_ nodes) and impartiality (taking a bribe for destroying evidence should be unprofitable, so service should generate revenue roughly proportional to value of evidence it stores).\n\nThat's not to say that Factoids are a good investment...

This is called the **block subsidy** because it's the newly created Bitcoin that has never been spent (this is called the *coinbase*, has nothing to do with the company) Every 4 years this amount halves. Right now people get `25.0 BTC` for the block. (If you consider a block is mined every 10 minutes, that's 6 blocks an hour, or 144 blocks per day, at roughly `3600.00 BTC` (`$900,000` at $250) per day. That's their current incentive.\n\n* The block subsidy will never truly equal zero. It may be so small it cannot be represented by 8 digits of precision, and therefor cannot be sent/received in the Bitcoin network, but it will never be zero. (This means in theory we could extend the precision beyond 8 digits and new coins could be printed, albeit at epsilon/small values)\n\n* Every transaction includes a **miner fee** (which can be zero, but then the transaction probably wont be included) and the miner gets the sum of all the fees. Over time it's expected that the sum of miner fees will replace the subsidy, until one day there is essentially no subsidy and the Bitcoin is an open market of transactions with fees the users select ": 2, "> My guess is that tx fees won't be appreciable in 10 years; maybe 20 or 30\n\nNot too long from now the subsidy will god down to `12.5 BTC` per block, and within 12 years it will be `3.125 BTC`. Even if the tx volume is only 5,000 by then that's still `$0.16` per transaction.\n\nYou could be right about it being 20 years, but I'm kinda in the 10-15 year range because I think transaction volume will continue to grow heavily.": 1, "Depends on if things are denominated in USD or BTC entirely. My pseudo-metric of decent there is that it's still orders of magnitude more than transaction fees. I'm not doing math correctly right now, but a 25 BTC reward right now with about an average of ~500 transactions per block. To compete transactions would need about a $12 fee, and if transaction volume double it would still need a $6 fee.

Neither the value of 1 bitcoin, nor the difficulty of mining are fixed. Simple example: in 2010 I\'m sure nobody considered a ~~25~~ 50 bitcoin reward particularly "decent" when bitcoins were less than $1.\n\nWe have no idea what 12.5 bitcoins will be worth in real terms in 2019. If it turns out to be very low (compared to today) then it\'s a reasonable assumption that the hashing power will fall (people will be less incented to spend energy on mining bitcoins). If it turns out to be very high compared to today, then in effect the reward might have increased rather than decreased.

Litecoin spiked in price when bitcoin started to crash, because people assumed it was competition, but then litecoin soon followed suit and crashed as well. So all of the sudden you have a coin thats been pumped and dumped, and many are skeptical if it will recover, because its big brother Bitcoin was also being questioned at the time.\n\n*  Other Alts: Right around the same time as litecoin crashed, other alts began to emerge. litecoin is faster than bitcoin, but thats about all it does differently. It also has a lot higher coin count (this is important later). After people saw litecoin rise they came to the realization that any coin could similarly rise. Now this intuition lead to many of scams, and thats why you cant talk about alts on the /r/Bitcoin without being immediately dismissed...  but some of these Alts  are actually legitimate, and are working on inovative features...anonymous transactions,  instant transactions, staking in the network to earn interest on coins, built in decentralized marketplaces, special wallet features, digital assets...ect. Theyre basically acting as crypto-currency startups looking for people to buy into their features.\n\nLitecoin isnt trying to do any of that. Its a slightly faster bitcoin clone. Thats it, so its losing the battle on inovation.  These alts also have a lot lower coin count... so theyre a lot more rare than litecoin. Traders see that the value of a different altcoin can skyrocket on a much lower market cap than litecoin. Theres basically been a gold rush looking for the most innovative coin. All of this while Bitcoin and litecoin stay the same. \n\nNow Bitcoin gets away with it, because it was first, thousands of startups are trying to make features for bitcoin, which rivals the various alt coins being developed. Litecoin isnt getting those startups anymore to want to build on their network, infact other alts are starting to attract the attention that litecoin once had.... and like I said before if you dont have a popular network you wont have a network or value very long. \n\nSo, no dont do it, Litecoin is losing popularity, and isnt doing anything to win it back. stick with bitcoin or ride the roller coaster of playing the altcoin market with a more innovative coin. \n\nEdit: it took me a while to write that out, but I get upset when people talk about alts, and they immediately get dismissed around here. Other coins will be used theyre not all scams, and some of them are brilliant (not Litecoin), and it wont ruin the bitcoin network either... the bitcoin network is too big to be rivaled.
