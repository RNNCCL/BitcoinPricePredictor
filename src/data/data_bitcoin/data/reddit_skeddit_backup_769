So they go ahead and complete the sale without waiting for confirmation.\n\nFor a medium purchase, like a piece of furniture, they might pull up your sending address, and check that the funds in it are well-confirmed (at least 6).  Then they wait after you send them your payment for a few minutes to make sure no other spend appears from that address except to them.  \n\nNetwork propagation time is on the order of seconds, so within minutes they can be pretty sure no other transaction can come ahead of theirs, and their payment is good.  With a furniture item, you have to arrange delivery details, or they have to move it from the display area to your vehicle anyway, so by the time that's done, the minutes to be sure payment is good is over.\n\nFor a big purchase, like a house, your funds are required to be in escrow at the closing attorney, and the stack of paperwork to sign takes at least an hour.  So waiting an hour for 6 confirmations is not an issue, you had to get your funds to them ahead of time anyway.\n\nIf you think waiting is a problem, provide an example where the type of purchase and waiting time actually causes an inconvenience.

I\'m optimistic for this change. RealSolid was just one person and it was difficult for him to do customer support as well as updates, fixes, admin, etc. The security, speed, interest payments, and feeshare options are all very good and this exchange innovated some of these concepts in the crypto world, some of which are now copied by other exchanges...  I plan to continue to use the exchange once it returns in whatever form.\n\nHis requiring withdrawal of coins as per the subject of this post - is a bit strange, I agree. ... But some positive speculation is called for I think: If the exchange is undergoing a major ownership and administration change, wallet security and ownership of coins in dead accounts may be a real issue in the sale of the exchange.. Perhaps they are fishing out dead accounts (and thereby the ownership of funds in those accounts) during the change of hands.\n\nI would look more closely into the allegations against mcxnow, most are "the guy is a jerk" which is arguably true if you ever see him in chat. But you\'ll never find" he lost my coins" or "he froze withdrawals". Yes, he\'s had to freeze trading (not withdrawals) once when customer support was too much for one person. Yes, his feeshares are volatile and issued by him when he chooses (although they are traded freely and not inflated). This is the Bitcoin world = caveat emptor.. stop complaining.\n\nI thought I would spread some more level-headed experience (leaning toward the positive) since a lot of the complaints here seem highly emotionally charged and if money was lost, it was not the fault of the exchange or owner, but rather due to personal investment choices, personality clashes, or "I wouldn\'t do an exchange this way". I realize RealSolid has a history - but if looked at closely its a history of being a jerk, and doing his own thing... its not a history of cheating, stealing, or bad business.\n\nI would prefer this post rather be a PSA: Withdraw your coins before Nov 15.. (similar to the one about Bitpay to get your accounts verified) rather than a smear.  I would prefer differences of opinion on how an exchange be run result in individuals choosing not to use the exchange, rather than a smear. I would prefer individuals telling others not to use the exchange, do so with evidence of real owner fraud or negligence, rather than sounding warnings to the community based on personality differences or disagreements with how things are run.  AT the very least say "he called me a vagina" and that\'s why you don\'t recommend his customer support.
