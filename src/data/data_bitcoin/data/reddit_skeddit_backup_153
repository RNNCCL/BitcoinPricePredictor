The consensus rules can be changed with a hard fork- for example the 21 million coin limit, or the difficulty calculation, or even the proof of work.  If a majority of miners and nodes agree to that change, the change can happen.  However Bitcoin is designed so that it's generally in your own profit interest to support the public good rather than working against it.  IE, if I mine a block that gives myself more of a block reward than I'm allowed, other miners/nodes will reject it and I won't get anything at all.  \n\nYou can make changes within the protocol that don't require a hard fork, for example P2SH transactions look different than normal Bitcoin addresses.  \n\nWe don't know that blocks will be the same forever.  \n\nHowever there are certain rules that are unlikely to be changed.  For example the 21 million coin limit- few would support changing that as it would remove a significant part of Bitcoin's value.  \n\nAs far as pruning goes- you can easily prune almost all the old transactions so you are left with the current UTXO set (list of all Bitcoin addresses and how many Bitcoins they own).  The problem is, this isn't trustless.  You have to then trust your UTXO list.  \nA full node on the other hand can trace a coin from when it was mined all the way to where it is now, verifying the signatures of the whole path.  That ensures that you don't have to trust anybody or anything- just verify the crypto and you KNOW rather than trusting.

However I feel he presents them in a one sided way. In my experience it\'s always a judgement call whether to make a clean break with older code to avoid technical debt. He may be right about it, but he may be wrong about it.\n\nI don\'t really agree with the "soft fork is unavoidable" argument although I see what you\'re saying, what I\'m saying is that a hard fork can redefine anything, so why not any of the soft forks that should have been hard forks.\n\nTo cut to the chase, I feel Mike doesn\'t have enough skin in the game. He\'s looking over the shoulder of these devs, rather than contributing side by side. Maybe he thinks they would shun him, but he could always be playing in his own XT sandbox to prove them wrong. In this particular case, he doesn\'t speak from the kind of authority of having written large parts of the code or having to pay the technical debt.\n\nI don\'t always disagree with him on his technical cost points though, for example I agree with his assessment that the Lightning Network has the potential to be too complex for wallet developers to implement. He\'s got a lot of authority there, since he\'s worked on Bitcoin wallet implementations himself (although he seems to have given up on that). His argument there seems sound since a Lightning client does sound tricky to implement.\n\nI even like the concept of going for hard forks (although never suddenly without some emergency cause), but I hate the idea that we are deprecating full nodes already without solving trust and privacy problems that happen when you don\'t run one (Gavin called running a full node a fetish) and I hate the idea that people want to run what I see as a cavalier risk of creating two incompatible Bitcoins to solve a future potential problem that is possible but just theoretical at this point.': 1, 'That\'s what we\'re talking about: Mike Hearn is saying that the concern about SegWit is technical debt right.

In fact he seems happy to keep copying the code of the people whom he thinks can\'t design things properly.\n\nTechnical debt is one of those assessments that are subjective.\n\nAs for security, it depends on the soft fork, not all soft forks are alike. In the "secure" case the design works like this: if you have not updated to the soft forked version, you will not see the incoming transactions. What you can\'t see, you won\'t trust. So people still should change to the new version just like in a hard fork, it just doesn\'t force them to to continue to be a part of the network.\n\nAs an example, let\'s say you do want to use multisig. Well if the other guy doesn\'t give you a 3* address, you can\'t just force that on him. \n\nI think Hearn is right to say that soft forks must be carefully considered and analyzed, it\'s not automatically "good" if it\'s a soft fork. Hearn is wrong to say that Sigwit if he says it is bad because it\'s a soft fork, because he can\'t name any negative effects other than technical debt, which is subjective and he is not a credible assessor and of course potentially has an agenda to promote hard forking since he is championing another hard fork.\n': 8, "Ok, I passed over that part of the OP's post.  My apologies, but let me address it.  Just curious, are you a developer?  I am.  I'm not claiming any special authority here, and I only ask so that you can relate, because I am, so I will speak from experience.  What Mike is referring to is that soft forks require very special considerations in code.  Imagine having multiple upon multiple soft forks simultaneously in code.  Imaging the complexity if those soft forks interrelate.  Given two soft forks (A and B) that interrelate the code has to handle 4 distinct possiblities.  None are activated, A is activated but not B, B is activated but not A, and both A and B are activated.  You can see this gets worse the more soft forks are in flight.  Not to mention that a soft fork is coded intentionally to fool full nodes into believing someting is true when it may not be.  Soft forks fool full nodes into believing something is true when it might not be.  This is what Mike is talking about.\n\nAs an analogy, I always compare technical debt to my garage and its 'cleanliness'.  Your garage, as you add items to it tends to become more and more less arranged.  This is a fact of thermodynamics.  Things tend to become less arranged over time.  Code is the same.  Refactoring is a tool for arranging things back in a neatly and understandable order.  Now the analogy of a soft/hard forks is hard to apply to a garage but let me try.  Suppose you want to park your car in the garage, but space has run out because the junk has filled up the space.  We have to get rid of junk, or rearrange the items in the garage to more efficiently take up space so we can park out car.  In our analogy of hard fork vs soft fork, a hard fork would be throwing out all the junk.  A simple solution, once and done.  A soft fork is rearranging the items (including the junk) to make space for your car.  Is the garage clean in the soft fork case?  Well you might say it is in the sense you can now park your car, but the junk is still there.  Over time, the junk will overwhelm your ability to rearrange the garage.  You will be forced to 'hard fork' your garage and get rid of the junk at some point.  Your ability to rearrange is more difficult each and every time.  Is rearranging the garage worth it or are you just delaying the inevitable and making your life harder when you have to again make the same decision.\n\nNow, as far as him merging in these changes, he does so that XT maintains compatiblity with the chosen strategy by core to do all these soft forks.": 2, 'The "technical debt" incurred by softforks is exaggerated. It would actually probably be *more* "debt" to do a hardfork, as you then need to maintain multiple versions of the parsing code (remember, we *need* to continue to accept the *pre-fork* blocks).\n\nWhile softforks do degrade the security of unmaintained full nodes to a small degree (they remain more secure than your typical light nodes), hardforks *demolish* their security altogether: following a hardfork, old nodes can be easily deceived to think a fraudulent transaction has 6-block or even deeper confirmation.\n\nSo in both these areas, realistically softforks are still superior to hardforks.': 7, "> The main reason to run the full node is to eliminate the risks related to the third parties. Isn't it a problem that a full node may accept invalid (according to the new rules) blocks and wouldn't even notice anything suspicious about it?\n\nIt's not ideal, which is why full nodes should be maintained and kept updated - but it's also much better than the hardfork case where the node fails and becomes *completely* vulnerable by accepting *only* invalid (according to the new rules) blocks.\n\n> I guess you are implying the situation where the old nodes only see the old fork and the attacker double spends the coins using the new fork. Doesn't bitcoin software warn the user in such a situation?\n\nIf the user isn't maintaining their node, it seems unlikely they will notice a warning. But no, whether or not they are warned would depend on the nature of the hardfork. With any structural hardfork, the blocks would fail to parse at the p2p level and I think not trigger a warning. On the other hand, softforks will always warn outdated nodes.": 3, "He just copied the entire codebase and then let it be, he didn't seem to be working on any corrections of the codebase to correct any of these other errors that are surely around due to the Core team being unable to assess technical debt.

Are you saying he should have coded the soft forks implemented in Core as hard forks immediately in XT?

It seems to me that almost all of the old guard at this point has been minimized.  I find that disgraceful.\n\nThe nature of a hard fork is one where nodes that do not upgrade continue to operate on the old chain.  I personally find this a better alternative than soft forking the network and making those old nodes behave differently by virtue of making them think things are true when they are not.  The debt that comes with that is greater than the possibility of a fork.

He should be promoting the thing I\'m working on!" :)\n\nBut in seriousness, I have nothing against you or your work. Let me enumerate premises:\n\n1) Lightning is great. Go ahead and ask Joe and Tad if I/we understand it. I think very highly of them, but LN is not out yet and definitely not yet in large scale production. This is meant to support a different kind of off-chain use case.\n\n2) Sidechains are also great. Go ask Adam and Austin if we\'re aware of them :) But deploying a new sidechain is not yet a routine activity. Liquid is the only sidechain in production.\n\n3) Postgres is widely deployed, in production, and very well understood.\n\n4) People are already doing off chain transactions in many different ways. There\'s no consistent way to do that. Many of these ways include recording intermediate state in databases, often Postgres. These applications are not going to be entirely subsumed by Sidechains and/or Lightning because (for example) some of them require a degree of speed/realtime settlement/volume that those technologies are not intended to provide.\n\n5) There\'s no Postgres extension for Bitcoin datastructures. There will be. Integrating full JSON into Postgres 9.4 gave a good alternative to running a separate NoSQL database. Now you could just run Postgres rather than that plus another DB. In the same way, baking Bitcoin support into Postgres via a PostChain would obviate the need to run two databases (it\'d be good if this was the path that the Linux Foundation and Hyperledger were taking, though haven\'t seen any news on that).\n\nNet: in technology speed, simplicity, and reliability do matter. The Postgres extension I described in the tweets is very simple to get out as a v1. It\'s just serialization and deserialization of existing well documented datastructures along with a function to take some BTC and post a summary of that (maybe a collapsed subset of equivalent txs, maybe a hash) to the Blockchain. A simple solution like this is complementary to Sidechains/Lightning as it can be stood up rapidly and has no limits on transaction volume, scale, or size.\n\n-------\n\nPS: Insofar as we are talking about well known technologies, see these tweets:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/abstr_ct/status/683368882325831680\nhttps://twitter.com/abstr_ct/status/683371346064203777\n\n> @balajis I\'m actually shocked it\'s taken so long for a #postgres ext. to be proposed.

That means you can\'t change an entry retroactively without changing the whole chain.  \nThe biggest difference between blockchain implementations is the way you generate a new valid block. You need to make sure no one can just change the whole blockchain, you need some kind of gating.  \n\n###Bitcoin\nBitcoin uses Proof of Work, you need to proof that you burned an amount of resources before you can amend the blockchain. This makes it so that retroactively changing the blockchain becomes really expensive. This is really important for Bitcoin because it means Bitcoin can be trustless. Trust and anonymity don\'t mix well, so for Bitcoin to be anonymous this is a must.  \nHowever this has a really significant drawback: Generating blocks is slow as a snail (compared to most IT things), which severely limits the transaction throughput. And even worse, because of difficulty adjustments and limited blocksize you can\'t just throw more computing power at it. There will only be a block every ~10min, regardless how big your mining farms get.  \n*This is the price you pay for a trustless blockchain.*  \n\n###Private Blockchain\nNow here is where private blockchains come in. Because there are private and not anonymous they don\'t need to be trustless. If someone fucks with the blockchain you can take them to court.  \nThis means you can replace the slow and inefficient Proof Of Work with something faster and less resource intensive. The simplest form would be just giving every participant a private key with which they sign their new blocks. This in turn means you can have much faster block times, you could have a block every minute or every second or 100 blocks per second. Your transaction throughput can easily be massive, and you only need to spent a fraction of the energy bitcoin mining uses.  \n###Tl;dr:\nPrivate blockchains and Bitcoin have different properties and uses.  \nPrivate chains are faster (more tp/s) and "waste" less energy, but they aren\'t trustless or anonymous.  \nIf you want **(semi)anonymous, censorship resistant, decentralized transactions, Bitcoin** is the way to go.  \nBut for something like a (inter)national currency a private chain (as in, mining is only allowed for invited parties, transactions can be made by anyone) is better suited. \n': 1, "It's not impossible but creating a private blockchain removes the core principles of Bitcoin.

The exact amount (in bitcoin) of your purchase gets put into the Purse escrow when the earner submits payment for your order. That's the time-event that marks your actual cost in bitcoin.

Just like in the business world if I provide goods/services to a company and then invoice them, I have essentially provided my goods/services on credit and the business will pay me at a future date. This is what is occurring globally with Amazon and contractors, however because of banking regulations in certain countries Amazon can not pay them cash so they essentially grant the vendors/contractors credit (It sits on Amazon\'s balance sheet as a liability). Essentially these contractors can\'t use or don\'t want to use the credit to purchase Amazon services so they in exchange are willing to essentially sell their credit at a large discount in exchange for bitcoin. They then can use bitcoin for purchases elsewhere or can trade on an exchange/localbitcoins to convert back to their local currency. This has created a more efficient market for money and allows vendors to get access to a more liquid medium of exchange that they prefer.

The BIS and the Federal Reserve Bank were the main culprits for the crash.\n\nFew people understand that the Basel 2 Banking Accord that was being implemented in 2004-2007 changed the bank capital requirements to HEAVILY incentivize mortgage lending at the expense of traditional corporate lending.  The crux of the regulatory change was to create nearly infinite leverage for mortgage and government lending in order to redirect the flow of high-power money (and its consequent pyramiding) into the more politically favored sectors and away from lending to both large and small businesses.  And just to reinforce the point the regulators increased the capital requirements for corporate lending at the same time, thereby further restricting capital flow and leverage in those sectors.\n\nThe ostensible reasoning behind this move was to reduce the moderate default probability idiosyncratic risk on bank books at the expense of increasing the low default probability systemic risk.  \n\nAs early as 2004 those of us who were having our businesses shrunk in this way argued that reducing idiosyncratic risk at relatively low leverage ratios, in order to increase systemic (correlation) risk at MASSIVELY higher leverage ratios, all for the effect of achieving cheap lending to governments and poor people (less productive sectors of society), was both stupid and dangerous.

And so on. Using the Blockchain URI, any block explorer or suitable kind of tool could offer the choice to a user to register it, and any blockchain reference will work with no additional efforts.

But if I though bitcoin price would rise to $800 by July, I could get it for 1 BTC. The price would be unlikely to change from $800. Dollar prices just don't change so suddenly for most things.

A steady state of deflation is an economy\'s way of broadly distributing its productivity gains.  The way our current FIAT monetary system works the banks (via the central bank cartels) take all of the aggregate societal productivity gain for themselves and their buddies and then take a little extra off the top from aggregate societal savings to boot.  Bitcoin can put a stop to that and add a little boost to savings to encourage (rational) investment for further productivity gains.\n\nIt is important to realize that consumption does not make us wealthy and comfortable, production does.  While consumption may drive production to a greater or lesser extent, savings and investment ultimately drive rationally efficient increases in productivity which fuel increases in wealth.  A deflationary currency sets a hurdle for the expected return of investment at the deflation rate of the currency, thereby helping to ward off the mal-investment that creates boom-bust cycles.\n\nIt\'s helpful to read all of Keynes\' "General Theory..." and then compare and contrast with something like Rothbard\'s "Man, Economy, and State."

All you have is a correlation (which is some evidence, but far from conclusive).  But *another reasonable explanation* is that the pools offer very little differences between one another, so individual miners, recognizing the value to Bitcoin (and thus their own operations) if hash power is diversified, simply choose the pool with the lower hash rate when deciding which to add their knew equipment to.  After all, choosing a pool with 26% vs 23% does not really add much value when it comes to helping solve the next block (or variance), so if it is cost free, why not choose the pool that will help benefit Bitcoin as a whole?\n\nWith that said, if you did provide conclusive evidence of collusion, I would not be in the least surprised.': 8, "A lot of the hashing power installations divide their hashing power among multiple pools; I wouldn't be surprised if some of them deliberately try to keep different pools balanced in size for PR reasons.": 33, 'So, you keep telling me what rational people would do, over the course of 4 comments, in response to my comment that said "people are innumerate, and therefore not rational" as if your responses are some kind of rebuttal.

The fuck?": 1, '>It is in the pool joiner\'s best interests to join the larger pool, which makes the larger pool even more large than the competition again increasing the chances of receiving the next reward.\n\nThis is true only in isolation and in extremes.  But it is also true that it is in the miner\'s interest that Bitcoin remain decentralized.  However, because of the "tragedy of the commons" type situation from mining, miners tend be unwilling to give too much individual opportunity cost to protect the better interest of a their investment by protecting the interest of Bitcoin.  However, as you point out, the opportunity cost is only "slight."  And choosing the lower hash power pool is as easy as choosing the higher, and it "helps" Bitcoin.  The opportunity is practically negligible.  Accordingly, it would seem that many miners who are not acting in isolation, but with some consideration of the bigger picture, determine that with only a slight opportunity cost, promoting the health of the Bitcoin economy is in their best interest.\n\nYou can see this effect in other tragedy of the commons type scenarios.  For instance, people aren\'t usually that willing to go too far out of their way to recycle.  But they\'ll go a little out of their way because it\'s presumably "good for the planet."  If blue trash cans are provided with a label, the hassle (cost) becomes so slight that they will endure it to help the planet, even though they realize that their little contribution is practically meaningless.\n\nIt seems the same would be true with miners.  The benefit of 26% over 23% is so slight that the contribution to the Bitcoin health (even though seemingly insignificant) becomes more valuable. ': -1, '> After all, choosing a pool with 26% vs 23% does not really add much value when it comes to helping solve the next block (or variance), so if it is cost free, why not choose the pool that will help benefit Bitcoin as a whole.\n\nA pool with 26% of the hashrate has a slight edge over the 23% pool in receiving the next block reward. It is in the pool joiner\'s best interests to join the larger pool, which makes the larger pool even more large than the competition again increasing the chances of receiving the next reward. People doing it "for bitcoin" are acting against their own rational self interests over short timescales. Are you suggesting that pool participants are more altruistic towards bitcoin and the corresponding community?': 1, 'We are not hardware consumer. We do not own a single TH/s of hashing power.': 6, '>In other words, "rational self interest" arguments don\'t work when people are innumerate and don\'t follow rational decision-making. \n\nThis is becoming such a strange conversation.  But anyway, miners can rationally decide to join the pool with the lower hash even when the pools have no material differences, because there are other considerations.  Particularly, there is some individual value (even if little) to supporting Bitcoin as a whole by diversifying the hash power.  So if they find that value to be higher than the practical negligible cost of using a pool with a slightly lower hash and it is not too burdensome to do so, it is rational (even reasonable) to join the slightly lesser pool.': -3, 'No there isn\'t.

Another big idea is you can't change rules unless every node goes along with it, otherwise you fragment the network.

To extend the range and expertise of its mentor network, the programme will collaborate with Startupbootcamp Fintech.\n\nnexuslab will host its three-month programme, which will take place in a predominantly virtual setting based on a secure collaboration platform to facilitate tailored coaching sessions and offer on-demand training. Three weekend hangout sessions in major European cities will provide founders of participating startups with the opportunity to meet face-to-face and learn directly from successful fintech companies. Throughout the program, the start-ups will be individually matched with senior level mentors and financial services experts to receive practical advice on regulatory, technical and commercial aspects of their specific business. nexuslab will collaborate with Startupbootcamp Fintech to provide participants access to selected experts and build on Startupbootcamp\xe2\x80\x99s experience of helping and growing startups. During the final month of the programme, all teams will gather at the nexuslab pop-up lab in Zurich for additional in-person mentoring and to prepare their ideas for a pitch day.\n\nnexuslab will consider applications both from teams with convincing early-stage ideas and startups that have already acquired seed funding. At least one of the founders needs to be based in Europe. nexuslab is open to fintech ventures with business models based on or related to blockchain technology. The programme features three tollgates at which a decision will be made whether a team will progress to the next stage.
