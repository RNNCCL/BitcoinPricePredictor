Zimbabwe may be a particularly extreme case. I see Bitcoin filling a need in places where there is a significant amount of money, but that money is at risk (from government actions, possible inflation, or banks freezing accounts as in Cyprus). So maybe Russia as an example, though they don't seem interested in Bitcoin right now. I would also think of places where there is a lot of economic activity despite the general poverty, such as India.\n\nRegarding your point on cultural mindset, I think that is more an American thing than an overall Western thing. Tips certainly are much less expected in Ireland and many other European countries than they are in the US. The disposable income aspect to it however is certainly similar.\n\n>The reality is that developed countries have many examples of the former, while developing countries have more examples of the later. Bitcoin is more likely to thrive in areas where people have disposable income that they can convert to Bitcoin and experiment with.\n\nThis certainly is true, the mantra on this subreddit is that you shouldn't buy more bitcoin than you can afford to lose. Clearly if you are higher up the economic ladder, you have more freedom to gamble on something new. Yet, isn't it interesting that mobile phones took off so quickly in Africa? Surely a mobile phone was a big risk for most early adopters, they may be cheap but the cost is not insignificant. It seems that the need filled by mobile phones is just great enough that that lack of disposable income was overcome.\n\nAlso, doesn't the M-Pesa example you linked show that really, this need clearly is there, and Africa is already leading the way in terms of practically used digital currency, precisely because of this need. It's an ad-hoc approach, and imperfect because of the centralized nature, but the solution exists because the need exists.\n\n>A Remittances Solution\nI doubt that Western Union or MoneyGram will ever be able to lower their transaction fees to something closer to 20,000 Satoshis (~8 cents). However, with Bitcoin low fees are now a possibility. Come to think of it, if you're not worried about quick confirmations, then Bitcoin potentially brings down the transactional cost of cross-border remittances to near zero. Friends and relatives sent $32 billion US to Africans last year, but they lost $2 billion to transaction fees. This is ridiculous! A few months ago, William Suk gave us an in-depth review of a remittance service that was built on Bitcoin and is working today in Kenya. In my opinion, remittances are the low-hanging fruit, and it's only a matter of time before we see similar solutions being deployed in other developing countries.\n\nYou're totally right here, I used to work in a company providing a form of remittance through mobile airtime, and they were competitive because airtime remittances had much cheaper rates, yet even they took a big chunk, especially through FOREX rates. I see bitcoin remittances as the bootstrap personally for all other services.

The relevant bits here are the following:\n\n> If any of the outputs (including any change) of your transaction are less than 0.01 XBT, then a fee of 0.0001 XBT is required.\n***\n>  If the coins you're spending are too small or too new then your transaction won't qualify as free. Each transaction is assigned a priority, determined by the age, size, and number of its inputs.\n\n> Specifically, for each input, the client calculates the value of the input in XBT multiplied by the age of the input in blocks. It sums these products over all inputs and divides the total by the size of the transaction in bytes. If this gives a number less than 0.576 then the transaction requires a fee.\n***\n> Finally, the client checks the size of the transaction in bytes. The size depends on the numbers of inputs and outputs, and is roughly: `148 * number_of_inputs + 34 * number_of_outputs + 10`\n\n> If this size is less than 10,000 bytes and step 3 found that the transaction's priority was high enough to qualify as free, then the transaction still qualifies as free, otherwise a fee is required. The fee is charged per 1000 bytes or part thereof. The amount charged per 1000 bytes defaults to 0.0001 XBT\n\nThe 10,000 byte budget allows space for a transaction with ~67 inputs and 1 output. If you're rolling up a 'dust ball' with inputs of 0.00001 then 67 of those combined is only 0.00067 which, being less than 0.01, means you get hit with the dust fee of 0.0001 (around a sixth of your total transaction).\n\nYou're also liable to *not* achieve a high enough priority if all your inputs are faucet-dust (unless you let them age for a long time, or have one large/old input to include to bring up the average), which would mean that a hypothetical transaction just under the 10,000 byte threshold would still require a fee of 0.001; more than the 0.00067 you've got to spend.\n\nI spent a small amount of time on faucets at one point and I was able to consolidate a reasonable proportion, but the smallest payouts are now somewhat stuck; would cost more than they're worth to move them.": 1, "Originally it was altruistic: coins were near-worthless so dispensing a small amount for people to play around with was cheap evangelism.\n\nNow... you're either watching ads in exchange for a small fraction of the ad-revenue, or you're solving CAPTCHAs so that spam-bots can post spam in exchange for a small fraction of their spam-bot revenue.": 3, 'Is it dangerous to receive Bitcoin from them?

But there's a cost.  And keep in mind in such a system that is already centralized by its nature, the issuer needs to still worry about being attacked and have fake tickets issued at the will of an attacker.  That could even invalidate the other tickets issued.  So it's a problem you aren't going to avoid (centralization).  The only problem being solved with decentralization is transferring of ownership, which a venue really doesn't care about too much, and can easily handle with centralization if they did care about it.\n\nThen again, places like Stubhub are able to charge huge fees to consumers because of the risk of tickets being invalid and being able to guarantee validity and refund/get more tickets for someone if they turn out to be invalid is expensive.": 1, "You could already do a proof of ticket with colored coins on the blockchain but if you went that route I'm not sure how you'd integrate the seat and event info etc.": 2, "It's a superior and less expensive security model.

Likewise, digital tickets could exist with centralization (just trade through the venue).  One possible advantage I could see is if you had atomic transfers of tickets with Bitcoins.  That way if someone does try a double-spend, your Bitcoins basically get refunded to you.\n\nSeems like Bitcoin conferences are a good target market for something like this getting started, but I can see why they wouldn't want to allow resale.\n\nIt seems like this has to get sold to the venue/issuer, and I'm just failing to find a good elevator pitch for them on why it would be a good idea or what problem it solves.": 1, "That's really interesting...\n\nYou could do that on Counterparty, also you might be able to improve the case where people are racing to buy tickets the instant they are released with something a little more civilised, smart contract auction perhaps or provably fair random distribution of tickets to a subset of bidders.": 6, 'You need to know the public key of the issuer is actually the public key of the venue.

The basic idea of Counterparty is also really simple. You need the ability to issue new assets, transfer arbitrary assets, and trade among them. Maybe it's a night of work instead of half an hour.

If there are even just a few stupid or generous miners who accept transactions at a loss, then miners as a group lose their ability to enforce reasonable pricing. If 1% of miners accept transactions with essentially no fee and 99% of miners only accept transactions that are high enough to pay for their current costs plus a little profit, then at least some users will send transactions at the lower fee level to save money. But since adding just one more transaction is nearly free, the latter group of miners will constantly want to accept these cheaper transactions as well to make a little more money, and I\'d expect the percentage of low-fee miners to gradually increase. So I expect the actual transaction fee to move toward the cost of adding a transaction to a block, which is almost nothing, and certainly not enough to support sufficient network security. Fees (and therefore eventually network difficulty=security) end up being a "race to the bottom".\n\nTherefore, I think that it\'s very likely that ordinary fees will not be sufficient in the future. There are several proposed solutions. One is to keep the max block size small (it\'s currently 1MB and we\'ll need to hardfork to increase it). This would limit the supply and force rational miners to only accept the highest-fee transactions, creating something more like a market in mining. But this is potentially harmful for Bitcoin and network security in other ways. Another solution is assurance contracts, which I think will be sufficient, though others disagree. There are also other possibilities.\n\nThis topic has been discussed for a very long time: take a look at my [third post on the Bitcoin Forum](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=48.msg328#msg328).

In this way, as long as most mining power is using the new rules, the chain is guaranteed to converge to a state containing no transactions breaking the new rules.\n\nAFAICT, the only reasonable way to prevent sidechain transactions after a softfork is by refusing to accept blocks that contain any transactions that spend OP_NOP1 outputs (or whichever NOP opcode ends up being used) or by only allowing certain whitelisted transaction types. But if you reject such a block, then you will end up on a different chain than the one chosen by both old nodes (before your change) and nodes that accept the new rules.

"Part of keeping a system decentralized is to be wary of centralized decision making. Be wary of the ones who pull the strings."  The only people really still pushing this fallacious argument anymore are those heavily involved in Bitcoin Core.\n\nLet\'s assume for a moment that a group of individuals decides to follow this advice. So, they start with the Bitcoin Core code base.  Now, in the forked version, they clean the code up, refactor it, and update it to use more modern coding practices. Being humans, having no spec, and a code base with very little test coverage, the updated code accidentally breaks a few consensus corner cases that go unnoticed. They also decide to add some new features users desire which allows this new forked version to become popular.\n\nThe threat model is the nearly the same, if not identical.  In fact, history has already shown that you don\'t even need to fork the code base to cause a chain fork.  Bicoin Core has already forked against _itself_ though that is conveniently left out of the argument.  The point is that mistakes can be made which cause a fork which points to the fact that the consensus mechanism, as it is implemented today in Bitcoin Core, is more fragile than it should be.  The more important part is improving the ecosystem to identify all of these supposedly unknown issues that makes it so unsafe which in turn ultimately _reduces_ the chances of it happening again in the future.\n\nFurther, there is more than one way for a miner to mitigate the risks to begin with.  In fact, it would be in miner\'s long-term best interest to setup mitigation so that future accidental forks within Bitcoin Core itself can be handled gracefully unlike the one that has already occurred.  Those same mitigation techniques extend to alternative implementations.  The combination of miners properly setting up their infrastructures to mitigate risks and the fact any issues can be fixed rapidly, means that the forks those pushing this argument are so afraid of today, can essentially be made a non-issue.\n': 8, 'Excellent.

For the biggest merchant-services business to show literally 0 growth in 8 months in what's supposed to be a small, nascent and rapidly evolving ecosystem, about half a year after their $150m valuation, after sponsoring a bitcoin bowl, after reducing their fees to 0% for everyone, after launching their European HQ, is absolutely shitty.

Are you referring to the subject line of the post?\n\nI post a lot more than 3 times a month.  I probably plug Novauri once a week.  It usually is popular too.  People are very supportive of the idea of a brokerage that doesn't control your bitcoin.  If that wasn't true, then why do the posts hit the front page 50% of the time?  It's not like we have a lot of seed money to spend on marketing departments of fake upvotes.  I don't even think that's possible, reddit has some pretty fancy stuff going on under the hood.\n\nSpeaking of posts though, if you compare the number of posts I make about our business to some other services, we're probably doing 1/10th the volume of the other guys.  Especially if you go back a few months.  We're not even in the same league.\n\nPlus, I'm actually here for a reason.  I need beta testers.  We need a few hundred more to have a good enough population to use in our beta test period.

Do you feel that other similar services were leading the charge in offering decentralized services?  Until very recently, you had no option to control your own keys at similar services.  Our entire business is built around that concept, and I feel it's going to become the norm in the future.  We've absolutely got peoples attention and are forcing them to support these types of demands going forward, because if they don't, we will offer them.  \n\nSo yeah, damn right I'm going to be talking about it on reddit.
