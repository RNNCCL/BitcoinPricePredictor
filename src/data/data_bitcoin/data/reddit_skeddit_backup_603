If the $100 was cash, then this forms a part of their reserves.  They take the $100 cash from the depositor, and credit his account.  The $100 in cash is now the bank\'s asset, and the corresponding $100 deposit is the bank\'s liability.\n\nIf they loan $1,000, then this increases the bank\'s assets and liabilities by $1,000.  The loan ($1,000) is an asset, and the corresponding deposit it creates ($1,000) is a liability.  \n\nTotal assets are now $1,100 ($1000 loan + $100 cash), and total liabilites are $1,100 in deposits.  Reserve to deposit ratio is $100/$1,100 = 9% (ie. 9% of the banks deposits are now backed by cash on hand at the bank).\n\nThe money supply has increased by $1000 through the loan (was $100 in deposits, but now it\'s $1,100 in deposits).\n\nThe following link is a good start to understanding how basic bank accounting works, and how it relates to reserve requirements and the money supply.\n\nhttp://wfhummel.cnchost.com/bankingbasics.html': 1, 'Banks create deposits.

Now people who previously held bitUSD are concerned about security of the system, so they will sell bitUSD for bitshares in order to sell them for real USD.\n\nSo the system will allow them to do that, i.e. bitshares which were held in escrow will go to people who wish to convert from bitUSD to real USD, and then those people will dump bitshares on BTS/USD market.\n\nWhich means we have a negative feedback loop over here.

Soon, BitShares will have relative orders so you can say you want your sell order to be 0.001% less than the price feed, and then just set it and forget it (until it gets matched).\n\nThe idea is that even if no one wanted to buy your BitUSD using USD in outside centralized exchange at a near 1:1 peg, you can get close to 1 USD worth of BTS within a relative short window of time, and then immediately sell that BTS for USD (or first BTC and then USD) as you get your sell orders matched.\n\nThe only remaining concern is how well does the moving price feed track the *actual* price in outside exchanges. For that you can look at these [charts](http://bitsharesblocks.com/charts/feeds?asset=USD). You can see that the median feed price does a good job of tracking the actual price of BTS (as determined from outside exchanges) over the past week or so. The deviations are short-lived and nearly always less than 2.5%.\n\nIf you want more detailed statistics on the feed price, check out http://delegate.ninja/assets/stats.html (as robrigo mentioned). Although, there does seem to be some bugs with that site right now (last update to the data was Feb 1 and for some reason it calculated a negative spread over Jan 22 to Jan 26); I'm looking into it. \n\nThis tool allows you to select any time window you wish and see the distribution of the percent difference between the median feed price on the blockchain and the price reported by coinmarketcap at the same time (+/- 7.5 minutes). I recommend hiding all the plots other than feed price to get a nice picture. For example, over the period from Dec 20 to Jan 20 (over which period BTC dropped from $325/BTC to $210/BTC) the [distribution](http://i.imgur.com/Fy7XJUp.png) of feed price (relative to CMC price) could be modeled as a normal distribution with a mean of 0.76% and standard deviation of 1.42%. This means by a rough estimate one would have had a [70% probability](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=1+-+N%5BCDF%5BNormalDistribution%5B0.0076%2C+0.0142%5D%2C+0%5D%5D) of selling 1 BitUSD for 1 USD (or better) worth of BTS. That can be bumped up to [97%](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=1+-+N%5BCDF%5BNormalDistribution%5B0.0076%2C+0.0142%5D%2C+-0.02%5D%5D) if one is willing to sell at up to 2% below the real price.\n\nNote that the above analysis is really rough and most importantly does not consider liquidity (now that you have your *fair* amount of BTS, as determined by the price feed, how much USD can you really get out of it if the BTS/USD market is illiquid) or the exposure to the volatility of BTS as you are trying to sell the BTS for USD. But I suspect that these effects are small and will only get smaller as liquidity improves. Plus, even if currently there was a 5% cut in value of your BitUSD as you try to convert to USD, it is still better than a 35% loss in the value of your cryptocurrency (bitcoin's price dropping from $325/BTC to $210/BTC). \n\nFinally, because of the mechanics described above, people know they can get roughly 1 USD worth of value if they have 1 BitUSD in a short period of time (<30 days). For that reason, it becomes possible to trade BitUSD for USD directly (or some other asset you prefer more, like BTC) at close to the 1:1 peg. For example, check out the [BTC/BitUSD market on BTER](https://bter.com/trade/BTC_BITUSD). It has pretty good liquidity at the moment and the price is tracking the coinmarketcap price of BTC very closely (less than 1% difference).\n\nIn conclusion, if one cares about holding *cryptocurrency* that is *relatively price stable* without *counterparty risk*, there is no better option than BitUSD at the moment.\n": 3, 'BitUSD': 4, 'Single point of failure.': 1, 'Coinapult, BitReserve and Tether are all centralized businesses.

It contains programmatic margin calls in their internal decentralized exchange as a stability mechanism. This might make the system work as long as the market capitalization of Bitshares exceeds that of its assets. Main problems I see: the stability mechanism requires external price feeds from centralized exchanges (which are known to get hacked or "hacked" all the time) also, more importantly, the fact that the blockchain has nothing at stake: in this case it is not even the usual "proof of stake" but one by *delegation*: attacking agents just need to have earned the delegation votes and do not need any stake at all.

Take [BitGold](http://bitsharesblocks.com/asset/orderbook?asset=GOLD) for example. A lot of people in the BitShares community want to increase their exposure to gold by getting their hands on some BitGold, but they cannot because no one is willing to short it into existence at or close to the price feed at the moment (I guess since it is a crypto bear market still, people are afraid to bet against gold).\n\nUnlike NuBits, there is a hard mechanism in BitShares to prevent the supply of BitUSD from growing larger than the value of the collateral (BTS locked in short positions) backing it. Also, if the value of BTS drops low enough that the short with the lowest collateral ratio (USD value of collateral locked in short position / amount of BitUSD debt owed by short position) falls below a threshold (200%), that short will be automatically margin called by the blockchain and its BTS collateral will be sold for BitUSD (to cover the debt) at up to 10% above the price feed.\n': 3, "do you keep all your savings in BTC?

It is also possible the market would need to be \xe2\x80\x9creset\xe2\x80\x9d and asset holders forced to settle for BTS collateral worth less than the intended face value of their assets.*\n\nSo, as I was saying, the value in fiat terms of one bitcoin is irrelevant for the protocol unlike bitUSD that relies in the value in fiat terms that speculators give to its collateral for it to not fail.': 1, "I was thinking about replacing my bank with bitcoin.

But when if it collapses, it will collapse hard, because in addition to people naturally getting rid of BitShares, you'll have margin calls.\n\nMaybe, I'm not sure. But that is something BTS holders need to (potentially) worry about, not BitUSD holders. Because of the 300% initial collateral ratio and the 200% margin call limit, BitAssets are *extremely* conservative. It is designed this way to protect BitAssets from undercollateralization even with the incredibly volatile nature of cryptocurrencies like BTS.\n\nEven with the serious price decline in BTS over the last few months (which has been generally following the price decline of BTC in this bear market), all BitAssets have held their value with an average collateral level well above 200% (though some shorts have been margin called).\n\nRegarding the scenario you brought up, it is certainly possible, but I don't know how likely it would be. This is why we have such conservative collateral requirements. My guess is that the price would not drop *fast* enough to cause undercollateralization even as the BitAsset supply winds all the way back down to zero, unless there was some serious issue like a critical security bug discovered in the code that could potentially make the entire system worthless. It is not important how much the price drops but rather how quickly it drops relative to how fast people place their BitAsset sell orders and also relative to how fast the price feed updates. But since it is safe to assume that the price feed will update at least once per hour, it would require a flash crash in the price of BTS (measured in BitAsset/BTS) of more than 50% (and potentially quite a bit more depending on the collateralization level of the least collateralized short of that BitAsset) in less than an hour.\n\nThese kinds of black swan events are discussed [here](http://bytemaster.bitshares.org/article/2015/01/27/BitAssets-and-Black-Swan-Events/?r=arhag) along with how BitShares will resolve the issue in case of undercollateralization (forced liquidation of all balances of the undercollateralized BitAsset at a price equal to the ratio between the collateral amount and amount of BitAsset debt owed of the least collateralized short). The idea is that the BitAsset will either do a good job tracking the price of the underlying asset or in the worst case scenario the system will kick you out of the BitAsset and into as much BTS as the system can support without socializing the losses to shorts that maintained enough collateral in their positions or other BTS stakeholders that didn't want to gamble with shorting.

Payouts are made transparently either with a link to the coin generation block or better yet directly from the coin generation block (like p2pool, eligius, etc)\n\n* new hardware (and replacements/backups) was planned into the budget ahead of time. At least once a year, this keeps power costs lower.  \n\n* Some sort of monitoring and proof of actual mining was offered such as:\n\n* hardware order receipts/tracking info, pictures of hardware during setup (unboxing) and in use\n\n* coinbase signatures indicating a block was mined by the pool.\n\n* regularly (daily or weekly) updated blog to keep people informed on what "maintenance" is actually taking place. \n\n* grantee of a set payout each week/month. It can vary somewhat and lower over time of course, but I would expect that my loan be paid back in full within 6 months, with the additional earnings after that being counted as interest. Primary reason for this is that I can buy my own hardware and know that it will ROI in a set timeframe(usually less than 3 months, 6 is being generous). If the hardware doesnt ROI in at least 6 months its a poor investment and shows poor planning on the part of the cloud operator\n \n* Have at least a month or more worth of power costs already in reserve (in fiat) in case the BTC price takes a dive (like now) or difficulty skyrockets. Be transparent about how much is reserved for these kind of situations. If maintenance/utility reserves go below a months worth inform all partners imminently and make have a plan for some sort of emergency liquidation.\n\n* If the operation fails, customers are entitled to a (partial) refund and/or some amount of physical hardware.\n\n* At the very least an operation should meet all criteria for NOT being a ponzi listed here: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=878387.0\n\nBe honest with people, tell them you want a loan from them instead of trying to convince them you\'re giving something to them.

You could do the same for a paper wallet but need twice as many coin flips. So for a seed I do 32 (x4 coins) and for a private key you need 64. \n\nThe super easy way I generate hex from coin flips is first write down a simple hex digit "matrix". 4 columns by 4 rows where 2 coins select the column and 2 coins the row. eg. where H=heads, T=tails, this is a simple hex converter (many programmers can just do this in their head, but written down it\'s dead easy)\n\n      TT  TH  HT  HH\n    TT 0  1   2   3\n    TH 4  5   6   7\n    HT 8  9   A   B\n    HH C  D   E   F\n\nAn Electrum seed can be entered from hex digits using the "restore wallet from seed" menu item. For private keys you can use bitaddress.org (offline) or [some other utility](https://github.com/tkhaew/misc/tree/master/bkkcoins/keyfmt) to convert a hex private key to a WIF format and address. I prefer using Electrum offline with seed over the paper wallet. It\'s easier to monitor and receive payments, and when you send (sign offline) you need not worry about change and sweeping.\n\nThere are also Hexadice - 16 sided die with hex digits, but coins are more readily at hand. Use a cup and shake for randomness and I found smaller coins seem to be more random - though that\'s not very scientifically tested. I wrote an Android app for testing dice and coins for bias (it\'s on Amazon because Google Play store costs money to join even to give away apps: [DiceCheck](http://www.amazon.com/neoCogent-DiceCheck/dp/B00R122I46/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1422884304&sr=8-1&keywords=dicecheck)).\n\nIf you want a small Python script for converting hex keys to WIF then check out this simple utility (small and easy to check manually, and copy offline).\n\nhttps://github.com/tkhaew/misc/tree/master/bkkcoins/keyfmt': 2, '[Bitaddress.org](http://bitaddress.org)\n\nAn important part of creating a Bitcoin wallet is ensuring the random numbers used to create the wallet are truly random. Physical randomness is better than computer generated pseudo-randomness. The easiest way to generate physical randomness is with dice. To create a Bitcoin private key you only need one six sided die which you roll 99 times. Stopping each time to record the value of the die. When recording the values follow these rules: 1=1, 2=2, 3=3, 4=4, 5=5, 6=0. By doing this you are recording the big random number, your private key, in B6 or base 6 format. You can then enter the 99 character base 6 private key into the text field above and click View Details. You will then see the Bitcoin address associated with your private key. You should also make note of your private key in WIF format since it is more widely used.\n\n*You would need to flip the coin more times due to not having the available randomness of 6 sides vs 2.
