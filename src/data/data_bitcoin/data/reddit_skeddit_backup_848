I'm a developer myself, but I think I'm an orange belt to your black belt. Thanks for being awesome and creating tools like this for the bitcoin community.": 1, 'You already need a wallet anyway. The wallets can have it embedded. ': 7, "I haven't quite grasped the scenario of 'what happens if a node that receives coins to mix just drops off the face of the Earth', what happens to those coins? How do you work around this?\n\nSide note: you should also consider building in a timeout setting, such that a node involved in mixing cannot hold coins for more than X seconds or Y coins or Z transactions (or some combination); else, they could sit there collecting as many coins as possible and then walking off with them - unless there's some other mitigation to this already?\n\nIn short, how do you mitigate against rogue nodes?  Yes you have mentioned something about kicking bad nodes out, but what's to prevent a rogue node from just re-spawning under a different ID?": 1, "Yup.\n\nSynechist the PR guy also wrote a very eloquent explanation here that may shed light on how XC works:\n\nOk, there's layer 1: the Xnode protocol\n- nodes communicate with one another using an end-to-end encrypted protocol, so that anyone who intercepts their messages can't decipher them.\n- nodes communicate directly; they don't use any trusted third parties or central servers. Therefore there's no one point of failure or attack.\n\nLayer 2: an ad hoc meshnet\n- when you make a private payment, the first thing that happens is that your app sets up a network with a bunch of other nodes that are making payments at the same time as you.\n- this network exists only for the duration of the transaction, and thus has no permanent infrastructure that can be attacked.\n- since this network is a mesh, it does not encounter problems if nodes drop out of the network during the transaction. Thus it's robust against DOS attacks (i.e when a node refuses to sign, which breaks other technologies, like CoinJoin).\n\nLayer 3: trustless mixing\n- when you make a private payment, a transaction is built up between all the nodes in a meshnet. \n- they pass the transaction around in a very clever way **(analogous to Coinshuffle)** in order to send coins to their intended destinations on behalf of other nodes.\n- once the transaction is ready, each node checks that its own coins are going to the right destination, and if all is in order, the node signs the transaction.\n- the signing is done in a very clever way so that no node knows which other node's coins they're forwarding.\n- the coins are forwarded to their destination from a different address to the one that a forwarding node receives them on, so that there's no link on the blockchain between sender and receiver.\n- if there's a problem then a node will refuse to sign. This makes the whole transaction unable to be processed, and thus no node can steal the coins that it's forwarding on behalf of another node.\n- when this occurs, the nodes are able to reverse the passing-around procedure and discover which node caused the trouble. This node gets kicked off the mesh, and the transaction proceeds as per usual.\n\nLayer 4: multipath\n- when you make a private payment, the coins aren't sent in one go, but in fragments, making it impossible for anyone to tell how much you actually sent.\n\nThe ways in which all this is private:\n- multipath conceals the amount you send or receive.\n- mixing conceals the sender and the receiver.\n- the trustless nature of the mixing ensures that nodes can't steal coins and that they can't know whose coins they're forwarding.\n- the Xnode protocol ensures that nobody can decipher any of these messages in the first place.\n- in addition, using the XC TOR Stick conceals your IP address.\n- and, finally, when we add stealth addresses to XC, then when someone pays you, not even they will discover the address you receive the payment on, and so you don't have to trust them to keep private the address that your coins are on.\n\nBasically, there's nothing else to make private after all this. The entire thing is concealed; none of your personal information is given away. So it's 100% privacy.": 5, "Irrelevant, because no change is needed in Bitcoin to make this the default.

Nodes dropping out is a normal occurrence on a mesh (especially mobile meshnets), and they\'re designed to continually reconfigure their topology. So a node dropping off the face of the earth is "normal" behaviour.\n\nThis leads to the central point: nodes don\'t receive just coins by themselves, they receive the entire multi-party transaction as an atomic tx, so it can\'t be broken into parts and thus they can\'t steal anything. Each participating node can either sign or fail to sign the transaction, in which case the node just gets banned. If it does sign, then the correct amount of coins are sent to the correct recipient.\n\nIf even a single node refuses to sign, no coins are sent, the bad node is excluded, the mesh resyncs, and a new transaction is passed around for signing. If all sign, then it\'s good to go.\n': 3, "everybody's shuffling, coming soon.": 2, 'Does seem like a real step up from CoinJoin, but still requires same-sized denominations.   \n\nI guess a couple 50-way joins later your money is washed.': 1, 'How does this compare to zerocoin?
