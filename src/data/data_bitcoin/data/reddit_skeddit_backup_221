And it's awarded by a bank.": 1, '[deleted]': 0, ':)': 1, 'I wonder what I\'m doing with my life, explaining optionality on a Sunday afternoon :) ... anyways, here\'s an ELI5 explanation of the concept:\n\n*Note IANAEconomist, so the way I understand things may be different than what business schools may teach students. On the other hand, I haven\'t been "corrupted" by Wall Street yet. None of this should be construed as financial advice or recommendations to buy or sell any security, etc etc.*\n\nThe [financial greeks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greeks_%28finance%29) are a theoretical construct that helps explain why an asset changes in price. The grade that you get on a paper is a single number -- but many things go into that grade such as the content, the grammar, length of the paper, whether or not your teacher likes you, etc.\n\nThe greeks are:\n\n**Delta** - how the asset changes in price with changes in price of the underlying. E.g. an ETF 100% invested in oil has one delta: it goes up $1 with every $1 that oil goes up. An ETF that borrows money to invest 200% in oil would have 2 deltas - $2 for every $1 that oil goes up. Delta can be any real number (positive or negative). \n\n**Theta** - how much the value changes with respect to time passing. Think of an insurance policy: if you buy insurance for 2015, the insurance is obviously worth less in Nov of 2015 than Jan of 2015, because it covers less days. Long options = negative theta. Short options = positive theta.\n\n**Gamma** - how much the **delta** changes with changes in the underlying. This is harder to give a real-world example, but something that goes up more the price is away from the price you bought it has positive gamma; ditto for negative. Long options = positive gamma. Short options = negative gamma.\n\n(I skipped things such as vega/rho/whatnot because those sensitivities are harder to explain, and less relevant here).\n\nActual options/derivatives have direct optionality. Embedded or intrinsic optionality is a bit different, but is another way of saying that the same "concepts" apply, only to things that are not derivatives. E.g. buying biotech stocks gives you greater delta sensitivity than buying conservative utility stocks, because they tend to go up more with a increase in market prices (this is technically called [beta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_%28finance%29), but I\'m using an example for illustration). Neither biotech stocks nor utility stocks are options, however.\n\nAs for bitcoin? My opinion (note, **opinion**) is that bitcoin has positive gamma and theta exposure. Why?\n\nGamma - As we\'ve seen before and just last month, a lot of the interest in bitcoin is being driven by rapid price increases in a short duration. In other words, high bitcoin prices tend to generate higher bitcoin prices due to [momentum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Momentum_%28finance%29). That is, until there is too large of a deviation from [intrinsic value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrinsic_value_%28finance%29).\n\nTheta - Bitcoin becomes more useful over time given greater adoption/infrastructure/investment/clarity of regulations. The value is directly driven by this investment. Thus, it is quite unlike an insurance policy (negative theta) or gold (zero theta).  \n\n*In the long run*, theta is the fundamental driver of returns. The world generally becomes better over time. People and corporations make more money over time. And currencies such as bitcoin would probably become more useful over time.\n\nI\'ll end with some classic quotes:\n\n> \xe2\x80\x9cIf you can get the other side to act first, you win.\xe2\x80\x9d *~David Booth, DFA*\n\n> \xe2\x80\x9cWhen a buyer and seller have room to maneuver to complete a trade, who is going to get the better deal? Whoever is more patient and is willing to take more risk of the deal falling apart.\xe2\x80\x9d *~Victor Niedenhoffer, Practical Speculation*\n': 3, 'Always refreshing to read something from Fama, and not from the evangelist/"die Bitcoin" bank crowd.\n\nHis most important point:\n\n> Yeah, that\xe2\x80\x99s a very good question because, the standard belief among monetary economists, is that a unit of account\xe2\x80\x94which is what bitcoin is\xe2\x80\x94to which prices get stated, can\xe2\x80\x99t survive if it\xe2\x80\x99s highly variable. People won\xe2\x80\x99t use it because basically it\xe2\x80\x99s very difficult to know how much you need to settle. It is quite variable, they won\xe2\x80\x99t want to hold it as just a way of settling payments, they will try to get rid of it quickly, as they do; and that\xe2\x80\x99s not good for the survival of that kind of a unit of account. As if it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have a stable value it\xe2\x80\x99s probably not going to survive as a unit of account. What that means is that it\xe2\x80\x99s value is likely to go to zero at some point. What value does it have except as a unit of account?\n\nIn other words, bitcoin\'s ability to be useful as a currency is directly related to the ability to hedge its value risk. TL;DR: **derivatives**. That\'s why CFTC\'s affirmation of bitcoin\'s commodity status + the encouraging volatility work done by BitFinex is so crucial.\n\nI\'ll say this again - **the single most crucial next step to bitcoin\'s survival is the launch and adoption of an efficient, regulated, and legal derivatives (futures/options) market.** Who will be first?\n\nI believe he is mistaken on this point, however:\n\n>BU: Yes. Why don\xe2\x80\x99t we do wire transfers online at free cost? Why do we use the debit transfers at 2%?\n\n>EF: You know, that\xe2\x80\x99s just competition.

Currently monetary sovereignty is being manifested in items like physical gold, fine art, vintage automobiles, and Vancouver real estate.

It shows not the limit of Bitcoin, but the limits of human group behaviour. ": 1, 'Yes. Everything else is just technical nit-picking. Bitcoin is a bearer instrument.

That might mean for example the market was wiling to use Bitcoin purely to save transaction fees, when in fact a decentralised system is inherently more expensive than a centralised one due to huge redundancy and mining.  But maybe that is an indirect vote for the strong advantage of permissionless networks: a permissionless, but expensively decentralised system, can create freer markets and so maybe become cheaper even despite being inherently more costly in resources.  Or alternatively it's probably more likely that longer term heavy use of that would just act as pressure for the Banks to reduce fees, which they can easily do as their cost base is inherently lower running a centralised system as they do.  So I would view transaction cost as probably not a sticky, defensible advantage.  \n\nLightning might be enough once it comes online to change that long run stickyness of fee savings vs centralised systems as the assumption is the vast majority of transactions are then no longer broadcast - just routed like TCP via nodes between users, which is truly very very close to free, though there remains a transaction fee to cover the cost of capitalising the node.

I spend Bitcoins because I already hold them. As a first world citizen, I only hold them because I think their value should increase more than alternative assets I could hold instead and that they offer me a better risk/reward ratio.\n\nBitcoin has to be both nearly free and easy to send to make enough difference that we can project it as a possible future currency / asset / universal payment network.

I understand that it's possible to build P2P cash on top of the settlement network, but it's all vaporware as of today.  This misunderstanding, runs deep and even the most well funded startups in this business believed we would scale bitcoin by raising blocksizes without much controversy.  \n\nSomewhere within the last few years, things changed.  \n\nMaybe it was always obvious for the devs close to the source code, but somehow this was lost in translation to the growing community.

Bram dismisses this because he thinks it suffers from an attack: miners could at some point send txns to themselves with high fees. This would result in a block in which all txns pay high fees, then users would think "Gee, it looks like I need to pay a high fee to get my tx confirmed. OK then." So users start paying high fees, which makes future blocks full of high fee transactions, which means users will continue to pay high fees indefinitely.\n\nThe problem is that this won\'t work when a fee market exists, because in that case the marginal user is already paying the highest fee that they\'re willing to pay to get into a block. As soon as miners stop making fake transactions to themselves with high fees, the marginal transactions in blocks will again have fees as low as before the miner\'s scheme, which will signal to everyone else that they can lower their fees again.\n\n**The "miners lying to SPV nodes about the mempool" attack won\'t work**\n\nBram also exaggerates the ease of attacking solutions that rely on mempool information. SPV nodes would have to ask full nodes for mempool information, and Bram is worried that miners could just spin up a bunch of full nodes and lie to SPV clients about the necessary fees.\n\nThe problem with this attack is that SPV clients can ask for info from full nodes when they aren\'t actually sending a transaction, so they can learn which full nodes are trustworthy. Wallet software will usually be online for a long time, and it can collect a lot of data about whether it\'s getting trustworthy info from full nodes. If a full node tells an SPV wallet that it needs to pay $1 in fees, and then the SPV wallet sees the next block full of txns that pay much lower fees, the SPV wallet will know not to trust that full node. SPV nodes will also know roughly in what range fees should be by looking at previous blocks, so it\'ll know that it should be wary any time a full node claims tx fees should be much higher than ones it has just seen in blocks.\n\n**TL;DR**\n\nThe attacks Bram thinks makes his slow and complex solution necessary wouldn\'t actually work.

Maybe the mining industry will carry the torch if the price explodes again. ": 1, 'No.\n\nThe wealth distribution is by design of our financial system. Bitcoin also is by design a system that distributes wealth from poor to rich.\n\nOur current financial system creates the wealth re-allocation from poor to rich via two attributes: interest and inflation. Any money in our current system is created by the issuance of debt and any bank can create money via new debt. new debt always has interest and always increases the money supply. taking wealth away from the entity that receives the funds (interest) and the economy as a whole (inflation). Inflation happens autmatically since existing debt can only be paid with new debt and as such money supply has to increase over time or the system would collapse. people with wealth will as such move into asset which will increase over time with inflation. As such our system allows people with wealth to not suffer from inflation. People who live paycheck to paycheck or do not hold assets but cash will have reduced income over time and cannot escape inflation.  \n\nBitcoin works similarly but opposite. Bitcoin is deflationary so automatically people that hold more of it will gain value from people that hold less of it. People who receive pay in bitcoin would receive less coins over time and the coins of wealthy holders would gain in value.\n\nBoth deflation and inflation are two sides of the same coin: they shift wealth from poor to rich (beyond what nature does via giving us different abilities)\n\nIf you want a monetary system that does not do this we need "ideal money", an idea that Nash kicked off with his paper ideal money. Ideal money is essentially money that is stable in value (neither inflationary or deflationary).\n\nBitcoin gives us the technology to create ideal money. But the currency BTC is not "ideal" in that sense. Its far worse than fiat actually in that the wealth distribution would be much higher. \n': 2, 'But how does that solve the problem of Rich buying all the bitcoins and poor cannot?': 1, 'No, it makes the rich wealthier and the poor poorer.

I would go with the first option as well.\n\nI square that circle because I don't think that the state promotes income equality. It does quite the opposite IMHO. I think the state takes from the middle class and gives to the 'lazy' lower and the 'greedy' upper.

If you do hard things and provide value, you should get a proportional share of the pie.
