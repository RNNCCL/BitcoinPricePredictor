As Nchinda mentioned, I wasn\'t planning on addressing the "State of Bitcoin." It was a placeholder he created for the title of talk. brg444 - You\'re right, that does sound "presidential" and clearly wasn\'t what I hoped to discuss. Instead, the plan was to give an update on the Digital Currency Initiative, which I think might have addressed a few of the issues discussed in this thread. While it\'s disappointing to not have an opportunity to talk about the DCI at the Expo, I\'ll try and answer a few of your questions here.\n \nIt sounds like the principle concern is the amount of engagement I\xe2\x80\x99ve been able to sustain with the typical Bitcoin circles. It\xe2\x80\x99s a fair criticism and something I\'d like to improve. I think the challenge with starting an initiative is that you also have to focus on raising money, hiring a team, recruiting professors, and creating new classes that engage students.\n \nLast fall, we had two classes on Bitcoin, with about 80 graduate students. The majority of those students are working on 10-12 research projects this semester. We haven\'t had a chance to announce them yet, but we\'re hoping to do so when we launch our website. So, that\'s a long way to say that there are tradeoffs. I\'m happy with where the DCI is today, but I\'m bummed that the tradeoff was not connecting more deeply with people at events or online. However, Jeremy Rubin, Joi Ito, and now, Neha Narula have been actively engaged, and they more than make up for my absence. And I\xe2\x80\x99m looking forward to Jeremy\xe2\x80\x99s talk on Sunday. Long before I arrived at MIT, he played a critical role in igniting interest in Bitcoin at MIT.\n\nI\'m happy to address some of the specific concerns raised in this thread:\n \n--Speak on behalf of Bitcoin users: \nI would never claim to speak on behalf of Bitcoin users. Other than Satoshi, I\'m not sure anyone is qualified to do that. I did attend Davos and had the opportunity to explain Bitcoin to many people who misunderstood the technology. Don Tapscott was also there, and Wences Casares was there the year before. I believe the more qualified people we have explaining Bitcoin to people who don\'t understand it, the more likely it will have supporters instead of detractors. If there\xe2\x80\x99s ever an event I\xe2\x80\x99m attending that you\xe2\x80\x99d also like to attend or speak at, feel free to shoot me an email (bforde@media.mit.edu) and I\xe2\x80\x99ll be the first one to advocate for you to attend. \n \n--Boring essays and Bitcoin is not interesting:\nI, too, get annoyed with people who say Bitcoin is not interesting, but blockchain is great. When asked, I usually remind people that the world was changed by the Internet, not an intranet. I can understand why many people may prefer private blockchains to address constraints, like throughput limitations or privacy concerns, I\xe2\x80\x99m often also criticized for being too \xe2\x80\x9cpro-Bitcoin.\xe2\x80\x9d Part of the benefit of being at an academic institution is neutrality, and ultimately, we need to keep an open mind to all technologies in this space.\n \nbrg444 - Yes, if you are a deeply technical person, I can see how my blog posts might be boring. I\'ve heard they\'re quite helpful to people who are not experts, but I can appreciate your perspective.\n \n--Formerly worked in government:\nYep, I worked at the White House for President Obama. However, I didn\'t work for the NSA or have awareness of any of the programs that Edward Snowden revealed several years ago. There are more than 2.7 million people who work for the Federal government and about three thousand who work at the White House. I can understand why one might blame me for every policy action that took place under the President, but I think that is a pretty broad brush with which to paint someone.\n \nI can also understand why public service is not for everyone, but a lot of smart and respected technologists, including folks like Ed Felten, have recently taken positions in government. The benefit in having people from the technical community working in government during an administration is that it provides the technical community\xe2\x80\x99s perspectives when policy decisions are being made. Given the option of having technologists in or out of government, I would choose to have them in government for the powerful voice they add. But I can understand why people may disagree with me.\n \n--Affiliation with the Blockchain Alliance:\nI think there might be a misunderstanding about the role of this alliance. The goal is to provide be a resource for people in government to help them better understand the technology. In this situation, ignorance is not bliss. I know some may disagree with me, but I feel that the more informed people we have talking to people in government, the less government is likely to do things that are unreasonable as a result of being uninformed.\n \n--Attempt at running Bitcoin development:\nI\'m not sure I\'ve ever attempted that. However, I did offer Gavin, Wlad, and Cory positions at the MIT Media Lab, and have fundraised to pay their salaries so they can keep working on Bitcoin. I hope that is considered a helpful contribution to the community. We have zero influence over them -- feel free to ask them.\n \n--Bitcoin Patents:\nEarlier this summer, Andreas Antonopoulos asked me if I\'d be open to working with him to address the patent issue. In response, we pulled together a survey for the community, brought together experts from the patent community who have worked to address patent trolls, and drafted up three options to address the issue. While we originally thought that MIT would be a good place to do this, we quickly realized that the Berkman Center, based at Harvard Law School, was much better suited, as MIT does not have a law school. They hosted the blockchain patent roundtable in November, where they used our draft to help start the conversation about how to address this issue.\n \n--I\'m not remotely close to Joi Ito\'s level:\nYep, you\'re right. I completely agree. Very few people are. :)\n\nI hope I was able address a few of your questions. I\xe2\x80\x99m always an email away (bforde@media.mit.edu) for any questions or concerns you might have. And if you\xe2\x80\x99re at the MIT Bitcoin Expo, please come up and say hi.

The faithful say there are 110,000 transactions a day, but only about a thousand of those transactions are for the buying and selling of goods and services.

Each transaction has multiple inputs and outputs. The change output is just one output which forms part of each transaction. In fact, a company could pay it's entire staff using one transaction which had one input from their cold wallet and one output for each staff member (within certain limits).\n": 4, "What you're talking about is just that, insurance. Insurance costs money, regardless of whether you see it directly or not. The cost is built into the system. Between regulation and straight up business incentives, you'll likely start seeing some form of insurance in places like exchanges. This will likely be added as a value add for their business to give customers a sense of security. This will likely increase the cost of transactions on the exchange as a result. \n\nWhen it comes to privately holding onto Bitcoin however, it's really no different than dealing with cash. If you lose your cash because you misplaced it or just simply destroyed it, you're just SOL. \n\nDon't mistake something like GOX as a bank failure. This was simply a case of fraud which happens even in the current banking and investment world. Just look at what happened with Enron and Madoff. People lost their shirts over it in the same way. \n\nThe only real insurance that works like you seem to be implying is FDIC guarantees of banks. That only covers up to $250k per depositer, per bank, etc. That's purely to keep people from making a run on the banks like what happened in the 20s and to give the public peace of mind that their funds stored there are safe. It does not mean you cannot lose your money. \n\nFor one thing, it's incredibly easy for a government entity to freeze and seize funds from your account, even if it's just a misunderstanding. When it comes down to it, you do not own the money in your account, it's simply a credit in the same way you mentioned as storing on an exchange. You do not control the access to the account, the bank does. \n\nBitcoin is digital cash and can be stored with an entity you trust (like an exchange) or trustless by storing in your own wallet the same way physical cash can be. Just like with cash systems, you can choose to give trust to a 3rd party (hoping they will honor and give you some guarantee your funds are safe) or you can store and make your own transactions directly to the network and trust nobody. It's getting harder and harder for that to be doable with physical cash as governments restrict access to larger denominations and require tracking and paperwork for transactions above certain amounts and frequencies.\n\nIf you're looking to give you some guarantee for your own storage of Bitcoin, that's as fairly unrealistic as having someone insure the cash you keep in your safe. Now, could it be covered by something like a homeowner's policy or umbrella insurance? Possibly, but it'd likely be expensive and not worth it since a Bitcoin wallet can easily be made very secure. The idea of having someone hack your wallet is unlikely as long as you aren't stupid and use something easy to crack. It'd be tantamount to setting the combination on your safe to 12345.\n\nIn any event, the insurance of the financial system that you speak of does not even exist in the form you seem to think it does currently anyway, it's an illusion. What you're really thinking of are regulation requirements that will be necessary to some degree of exchanges and businesses much like we already do. Credit card companies don't insure their transactions for free either as that cost is passed on to the consumer through higher cost of goods from retailers and interest charges on balances. That there are shady businesses that pop-up and take people's money is no different than in the rest of the history of humanity. Anything that incurs a cost to the system is passed onto the consumers. Insurance is one of these costs. \n\nThat said, there will be business opportunities in this area for people who wish to use them if it seems prudent financially for them. For instance, exchange account insurance, Bitcoin card services that offer balance coverage for a nominal fee, umbrella policies, etc. Unlike cash, Bitcoin is much easier to verify and lock down. With something like an umbrella policy, maybe the insurance company requires that you give them 1 of x keys required to transfer funds from the covered wallet so that they are aware of transfers you make. If there is a market for it, services will arise that will fill this gap. This, just like any other insurance, requires placing trust in a company or some other entity.

In order for those funds to be insured, I need to be able to prove with a reasonable degree of certainty that it wasn't me that stole my own bitcoin. Given the degree of anonymity in the network, I'm not sure that a system of verifying claims as nonfraudulent could ever be developed thereby preventing the insurance of funds (bitcoin). It's hard to insure cash. \n\nI could see funds being insured if you hold your bitcoin in an exchange wallet. But then you don't really own your bitcoin anymore than you own your dollars in the bank. You have an IOU, and if insurance is involved, the exchanges are likely going to want to know who's bitcoins they're holding. \n\nI guess I see how bitcoin can function as digital gold, a store of value that has some friction associated with it.
