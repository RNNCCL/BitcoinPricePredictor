Most common is simple technical error.  They are legally obligated to unfreeze it as quickly as they are able, the same way if you take your car into an autoshop, it might take them a little while to find your keys if they misplaced them.  They are also legally required to freeze your account if the US government suspects you of money laundering.  Lastly, they freeze accounts when ordered to by courts, such as when you owe a debt and a debt collector gets a judge to grant an order to a bank to freeze your account so they can collect money is that is rightfully theirs.\n\nAs for banks failing to make true on claims: Banks are legally obligated to make true on all deposits.  If they can\'t, they must declare bankruptcy like any other business that fails to pay its debts.

The thing is, a majority of people in our position aren\'t wholly committed to the markets and simply see it as a get rich quick scheme. For this reason, they succumb to fear and greed - just like everybody else. When huge numbers of people give the same reaction you get massive price spikes for no logical reason. Don\'t believe me?

So when it\'s going up, you\'re looking for reasons to get in on it, instead of weighing the pros and cons to see if it\'s really a wise move.\n\nWhen most uneducated traders see a post like this, instead of doing their own research they think "Oh gee, this guy knows what he\'s doing!

People who\'ve made other currencies that require mining. And in that sense - it\'s all about network effect. Plenty have tried. Literally hundreds. And all of them are failing. It\'s heavily influenced by human psychology and social/group behaviors. I would say there\'s one other similar system that may have some legs to it. And that would be Ethereum.  But only because it\'s feature set is so astronomically more impressive. Of course it has its downsides.\n\nSo when we talk about bitcoin versus block chain, at least as far as pop-culture goes right now, we\'re talking about heavily modified versions of bitcoin being created by banks.

For that you probably need your token to be *valuable*, to incentivise miners into spending that effort, and persuading people to value your random made-up token is a problem without an easy solution.\n\nI can imagine it sort-of working in an environment where you have a limited pool of authorised miners with verified identities, who you have some minimal amount of trust in but still don't want to trust unquestioningly. Then you could use a blockchain to achieve rapid consensus without any one entity being in a privileged position.

No one in general in the Western Bitcoin world seems to understand why price is rising so fast. It makes one suspicious of manipulation, like pump and dump. So, may be a good idea to wait for a crash first. On the other hand, their comments may be interpreted as simply these insiders not owning enough bitcoins right now, and waiting for a crash because they have been caught blindsided by the rise in price. However, the crash may never materialize, if the rally is real. The rally may even accelerate, if people realize price is not going to crash or retrace, as they expect it to.\n\nPrice crashes much faster than it rises. Buying now, during a time of higher probability of price falling, means you have higher risk of buying at a top. Delaying buying means you have higher probability of escaping a price crash, and being able to buy lower. Suppose price does not crash, but continues higher? Then you may end up buying at a higher price, but there's higher chance it will be percentage-wise lower than the percentage you'd lose buying immediately and witnessing a crash.\n\nYou may want to wait for price to decisively break past $450, before buying.

If you do invest, you\'re now converting that anxiety into "did I invest too much? is it now about to crash? if it starts to drop, when do I pull out?"
