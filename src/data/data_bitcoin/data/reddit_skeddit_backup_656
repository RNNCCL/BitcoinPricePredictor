He doesn't trust these low quality exchanges, but with limited exposure he's ok with using them.\n\n* He buys himself some LTC, Darkcoin, Paycoin, Shitcoin and/or Titcoins, pumping them a little bit.\n\n* He transfers those coins on whatever altcoin's blockchain he's using into another shady exchange\n\n* He then sells the altcoins back for bitcoin, and transfers those bitcoins to untainted secure offline wallets.\n\n* He's now tired of registering for all this, having different stuff on different coins, the kinda slow tor connection, the opsec involved, so he starts automatizing the process, and comes up with a script that moves randomly amounts of 20~30 coins per day. He may increase the variability of the amount, he may want to use different timezones for the buys and sells...\n\n* Nobody rushes him, so he finishes his laundry after a year or so.

If the swap rate drifts away from this differential you have your trade.\n\nThe two obvious problems at this point are term and market depth. 30 days is too short a duration to do anything interesting, and based on the posted volumes you could not move a lot of money before blowing through all the posted offers. \n\nThis gets back to the conundrum: the Bitcoin debt market (i.e.; the ecosystem of borrowers and lenders) is not large enough to generate actionable market signals, yet the lack of visibility is exactly what deters long-term entrants.': 1, 'well, shit.... your post went right over my head.

Could you borrow USD, buy bitcoins and just hold them in a wallet for the duration of the forward? How do forwards for commodities work?

Set up a website that sells forwards, build up a nice reputation to convince BTC holders to lend to you. Why aren't people doing this? Probably lack of understanding. Maybe a difficulty of buying USD bonds when your business model involves bitcoins which have an uncertain regulatory landscape, but there may be other ways of lending out USD.\n\nAnother way is to use the bitfinex exchange.\n\nPeople can lend BTC on the bitfinex exchange which traders can borrow and use to go short. Right now it costs about [about 0.06% per day](http://bfxdata.com/swapstats/btc.php) to borrow, for up to 30 days. You can sell those bitcoins on the exchange (to go short), trouble is the USD can't be taken out and used to buy USD bonds. It can only be used to cover your shorts.

He needs to pay his workers at the end of each month in USD. So he wants to buy a **forward contract**, which is a right to sell BTC and receive USD at a future date, but at a price fixed upon today.\n\nThen every time the shoemaker sells some shoes, he will buy a forward contract for the same amount. At the end of the month all the forwards will expire and the shoemaker will hand over some BTC and receive USD, which he'll use to pay his workers.\n\nBecause of the forward contract, the BTC/USD exchange rate risk has moved away from the shoemaker and onto the financial institution who sold him the contract. The shoemaker focuses on his core business of making shoes, rather than his side gig of speculating on the BTC/USD exchange rate.": 3, "Well one way to make it larger is for someone to create an institution that sells forwards. As the institution gains trust and repuation, more bitcoin holders will feel safe enough to lend their bitcoins to it.\n\nThere may be regulatory issues too, since the institution would have to settle in USD.
