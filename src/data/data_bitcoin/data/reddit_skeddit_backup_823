As humans, we come complete with self-assembling replication instructions for our own physical bodies in the form of DNA, instructions that have themselves self-assembled over billions of years of environmentally guided evolution. This is true for all animals, but in the case of humans those instructions also come with what you could consider to be an "extensibility option" or an "API" or an expandable "plug-in library": Culture. At it\'s most basic that culture is tradition and language and social knowledge, but at it\'s more advanced levels right now that culture is also the skills and know-how to create and operate entire industries, to coordinate entire companies and countries, to operate and continually develop new technology, technology being at it\'s most basic definition a useful physical manifestation of our culture, and all technology no matter how complex being built upon successively simpler technologies that at some point down that pyramid of requirements can be intrinsically understood.\n\nThe thing is, that culture is potentially ephemeral. When we stop communicating, that culture disappears and does not have to come back. It\'s self-sustained and can be extinguished long before our own DNA would ever be extinguished, and as such a lot of us who understand this feel a need to organize and protect it, because unlike the instructions needed to create *us*, the instructions to extend us are not contained in out blood. This is traditionally the domain of (for example) a librarian, but more recently the boom in information technology has enabled new ideas and possibilities for the dissemination and safekeeping of cultural knowledge. These start with the idea of a digital codex, like The Hitchhiker\'s Guide or (Don\'t laugh) The Pok\xc3\xa9dex, and on into digital-biological interfaces like The Matrix. More recently we\'ve begun to realize the preservationist powers of distributed mediums like bitcoin, where knocking any number of involved physical devices out of commission cannot destroy the collective culture contained on said network (And as an aside, I find it interesting that more often than not the threats that these distributed efforts are commonly protecting culture against aren\'t natural disasters, but are ourselves. Bitcoin the currency seeks to protect economic culture from the whims of traditional economic industry, while distributed production seeks to protect with an almost Marxist energy the means of production from the inevitabilities of capitalism).\n\nOf course, all of these solutions still rely on *us* more than just living. Still considerably more effort than just having a set of DNA. At some point soon we\'ll likely be adding self-sustaining robotic custodians to the mix, which will certainly both complicate things and broaden horizons in ways that none of us can perfectly foresee. But in the meantime, while we figure all of this out I do keep seeing odd inconsistencies, mistakes from history possibly being repeated and the occasional potentially fatal inefficiency here and there in distributed concepts. As you /u/danielravennest seem to be fully invested (Quite literally) in the idea of distributed production, would you mind answering some critical question I have about this tech? Keep in mind, I do see efforts like these as valid alternatives to centralized production, but I\'d like to point out what I see as current hamstrings and hopefully learn what\'s being done about them, if anything yet:\n\n1) An environmental concern: My greatest fear for distributed production is that it won\'t be efficient or environmentally sustainable enough to be viable in the world of extremes created by 150 years of centralized global industrialization. While I do believe that human beings operate most sustainably and happily at the "tribal" or "town" scale - And that this is a perfect scale for distributed production - We no longer live in such a world. When there is demand for something today, there is demand for millions of units. How can distributed production realistically appease this kind of demand? Or rather, do you even expect it to? Computers are often built on full-city "campuses" to cut out the environmental/monetary costs of transportation of goods (See Shenzhen) and create flexible response to competition and consumer needs. Imagine the pollution generated from goods transportation *alone* if the production of Shenzhen was distributed across all of Asia, let alone the whole world? It would be a calamity - Global ocean shipping as it is today apparently takes our ozone to task already. What if this was the kind of transportation required by production, as well? Do you have a plan to address this or is it seen more as a "down-the-road" issue? Or (And this is a valid response) do you see distributed production as specifically a "post-collapse" solution to sustaining human industry?\n\n2) An economic concern (My girlfriend is a literary theorist focused on the influence of Marx so I find this aspect particularly interesting): OK so via distributed production, more people can "own the means of production" by owning just part of it instead of all of it. Factory machines become open sourced and the machines that create those machines are also open sourced. The barrier to entry for an incoming newbie lowers because the initial investment shrinks, and via replication a clear path for growth of their efforts exists. But in a capitalist world, how does this really prevent the largest fish from eating the other fish all over again? Like bitcoin mining, aren\'t the first on the scene the ones with a greatest advantage? What\'s stopping someone from creating a superior part-making machine and closed-sourcing it and then charging lots of money or royalties to use it? What\'s stopping a very large producer from suing a smaller producer out of existence for frivolous reasons? Once someone has all the machines assembled in one spot, what\'s stopping them from continually growing to current industrial scales, pricing out everyone else and bringing us back to square one? Essentially... How is a real-world distributed production system in any way resistant to the "coalescence" effects of global capitalism that we already live with? Furthermore, how is the idea of distributed production any different from the pre-industrial "Putting-Out System" cottage industry, which in reality did not give producers a means with which to grow?\n\n3) A regulatory concern: This question can be asked of almost any "disruptive" technology. Traditional systems that have existed for a long time have had their greatest flaws revealed to the public and in response the public has (Over time) developed regulations to protect against those flaws. These rules aren\'t always perfect but they keep the consumer from being screwed over and often also protect the business from unrealistic loss. Insurance requirements, regulatory agencies, industry-specific laws and other such things necessary for safety and order when you\'re operating in a world of 7 billion diverse interests. A disruptive tech that comes in and improves upon the existing system but also defies the assumptions of existing regulations can create big problems for consumers and competitors alike despite clear improvements in all-around workings. Forget ISP and taxi regulations and how tech has turned those on their heads. Just think how important industrial / factory regulations are to your average person. Factories can only be in certain places due to noise and pollution concerns. The environmental impact of many factories must be closely monitored to avoid contamination of the surrounding area. Etc etc. When everybody can have a tiny piece of factory in their home that\'s pretty nifty. But now every road is an industrial shipping road. Every household can deal with industrial chemicals. Every family member can be in close contact with dangerous machinery. Within the household these are not industrial-scale issues, but across a neighborhood they are. The total *volume* is still the same overall or larger (If we are to sustain our current production capacity as a society). Without the concentration of industry that our current system has, individuals might be hard-pressed to meet current safety and environmental demands. Nevermind what a massive undertaking it would be to inspect for these things. How do you suggest we regulate for this? What do you suggest we do / don\'t do? Who\'s responsible for compliance with any regulations in such a system?\n\nSorry for the very long-winded post, these ideas and questions have been kicking around in my head for a long time. I guess the theme of all my inquiries is scale. Have you ever seen Nausicaa and the Valley of the Wind? I always fantasize about a far-flung *post*-post-apocalypse world like that, where humanity has returned to stable medieval populations and yet surviving technology creates a sustainable system of trade and production, distributed across regions where residents of individual towns can be skilled in particular trades and provided for via a network like the one you envision.

Part of what the self-expanding factory does is build it\'s own power supply, initially as a mix of wind turbines, solar concentrators, and biofuel.  The solar concentrators are split between boiling water to run a turbine/generator, and direct heating for industrial processes.  A sufficiently hot furnace can also melt scrap metal into castings, produce bricks, and cement for concrete, all basic products that are also energy intensive.\n\nOur first generation design won\'t make everything people need and want.  We are aimed at the basics of food, shelter, and utilities, so that people can be layoff-proof.  In other words, you can still eat and keep warm without a paid job.\n\n> How can distributed production realistically appease this kind of demand?\n\nSelf-replication of the starter kits, and open sourcing the design for the starter kit, so anyone can copy it.

A billion smartphones is something like a megaton.\n\n> But in a capitalist world, how does this really prevent the largest fish from eating the other fish all over again?\n\nIf I have a self-sustaining (energy and spare parts) production system that meets my basic needs for food, shelter, and utilities, capitalist megafactories don\'t matter, because I simply don\'t need to buy their products.  I don\'t need to get a job to pay rent or a mortgage, because the robots supply the building materials, and possibly assemble the house.  There will be specialty items that can\'t be made locally by the network of people trading in a MakerNet.  For those things normal capitalism still applies.\n\n> When everybody can have a tiny piece of factory in their home that\'s pretty nifty.\n\nThat\'s not likely how it works out.  How often do you need new furniture, and therefore a suite of automated woodworking machines?  It\'s more likely you buy a share of a woodworking shop as needed, and resell it when you don\'t need it any more.  Alternately a small business owner runs the wood shop, and trades with the robot farm owner, etc. for the other products they need.  Even with automation, you need some specialized skill to tell the machines what to do and when.\n\nAt a very early startup stage, you can have a 3D printer and I can have a lathe, and we can trade.  But pretty quickly you will want to grow to a size where it is efficient for one person to have the skills for one specialty, rather than each person knowing everything to make all their own stuff.\n\nOur R&D location in Fairburn, GA is in the industrial area of Atlanta Metro.

Alternatively, one could set up a 'shadow' legislature using such a network and perform a sort of 51% attack on our representative government's democratic mandate by achieving a level of participation above that found in most countries' elections.

The project I\'m working on is aimed at distributed physical production.  A few concepts:\n\n* A "MakerNet" is a network of production nodes, where each node includes people with skills and some set of machines.  When someone wants something made, their order and payment goes across the network to selected nodes, who collaborate in the production steps.  As each step is completed, they get paid by something like escrowed bitcoins.  If the machines are sufficiently automated, the whole process can operate autonomously.\n\n* A "Seed Factory" is a starter kit of core machines which can make parts for other machines, including expanding the factory itself.  As you add more machines to the core, you not only can make an increasing range of products, but eventually new starter sets.  Such a factory doesn\'t have to be under one roof and one owner.  It can be distributed as long as the various machines can communicate and are designed to work together.\n\nThe [Seed Factory Project](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Seed_Factories) is aimed at developing and testing MakerNets and Seed Factories.  We just bought a 2.67 acre R&D location in Fairburn, GA (Atlanta metro). Unlike pure software development, which you can do with a laptop and internet connection, we need physical workshop space, tools, and materials.  So it is taking longer to get going.

Thus items like a robot farm tractor and automated greenhouse are needed, and we need a path from a core starter set of machines to get to them.\n\n> The analysis you talk about is difficult to perform on systems which haven\'t been made yet\n\nWell, it\'s easier when you know how.  You start from a design requirement, like "provide 85% of the food, shelter, and utilities needs for a community of 200 people".  The reason for 85% and not 100% is because, for example, some foods don\'t grow well in a particular area, so you just buy them.  In a second or later generation design you might go to a higher level.\n\nFrom the food requirement you can calculate land area and greenhouse size, and from that determine tractor size and materials to build the greenhouse.  Eventually you work back to how big the castings are for the tractor, and the solar furnace needed to melt the steel for the castings, etc.  The solar furnace requires it\'s own set of parts (mirrors, structural support), and you just keep working backwards until all the machines and the parts needed for them are accounted for.  This is tedious, but not terribly complicated.  Eventually you arrive at a starter set of machines, and specialty parts and materials you can\'t easily make and therefore buy.  Now you go forwards instead of backwards to actually make all the things you just designed.': 1, "> It's not just computing that will be decentralized.\n\nTrue, /r/polycentric_law and /r/bitlaw both attempts to decentralize law and society.\n\n/r/seasteading, decentralized cities.": 28, 'So Hawt': -2, 'For legal reasons we are not accepting "investors" at this time, that gets us into all kinds of complications with securities laws.

Paper proposes a solution for the problem of maintain an order book and determine the execution rate in the peer to peer network.

The paper defines basic ground rules for the working of decentralized exchange. The major components of the decentralized exchange are issuing process, co-existence of blockchain and order books and functions of the miner. Unlike other crypto currencies de-centralized exchange would have a trust based issuing process which in long run would be a sum zero game.

As you stated in your video, the bigger companies have taken measures to protect themselves and their customers.   It also sounds like some of those companies will get deferred actions: slaps on the writs w/ fines payable overtime.      \nAlso, you nailed it when you said this area is gray.

How those actions get resolved, whether their litigated and appealed over the coming and years, will become future guidance for other companies operating in the digital currency space.  So, I think we'll only see the the most flagrant violators get slapped with actions.       \nWho are the likely enforcement targets?  No idea, but where there's been smoke there is fire.  I think there are at least three categories of companies that could easily be targets of an enforcement action, all of which have had plenty of smoke billowing up this past year: those companies taking pre-orders (there's a new federal law applicable to pre-orders); cloud-mining companies (mining contracts are CLEARLY securities); and companies that have raised money using crowd funding, including companies offering ICOs.
