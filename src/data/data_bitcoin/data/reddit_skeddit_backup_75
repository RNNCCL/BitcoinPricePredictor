What this means is that with Electrum you can have an Electrum wallet on your main computer that is connected to internet, and your funds on a 2nd Electrum wallet that is on a computer or bootable OS that is kept offline. Whenever you want to send funds you would go to the Electrum wallet that is holding the keys and kept offline to create the transaction, you would then copy the signed transaction to your main computer that is online.  Could use 2 bootable TAILS for this setup also, just be sure to never let the 'airgap' one touch the network. In this airgap setup it is less convenient, but great security.

And there's no reason to think that miners or transaction-makers would voluntarily keep blocks small enough -- since it's a common goods problem, neither has the right incentives.\n\nNow *that* makes a lot of sense. Of course, as you anticipated, my first question was going to be how necessary are full nodes?\n\n>Bitcoin's solution to this issue is for full nodes to enforce a max block size small enough to allow full nodes to operate with a reasonably low cost. Without the limit, the incentives of everyone on the network would be strongly aligned to reduce the number of full nodes as far as possible. It is immediately obvious that this would lead to a small group of centralized full nodes at some point, increasing centralization and therefore decreasing security/robustness. It is less obvious that this situation would *far more quickly* lead to problems because if most of the economy is backed by lightweight nodes, then *miners* don't have any strong incentive to actually enforce the rules of Bitcoin (the 21 million BTC limit, etc.), so all of Bitcoin becomes insecure and worthless.\n\nVery necessary. Shit.\n\nWhat about full-node-as-a-service? Have you heard of anyone studying the economics of such a configuration?

A market must reflect actual scarcity. An arbitrary restriction of supply doesn\'t reflect any actual scarcity. The supply should be what miners are willing to supply for the going rate, as anything else is a centrally planned deviation.\n\nIt\'s important to note that we don\'t get to decide whether the market will decide the optimal blocksize/transaction rate/fee structure. It *will* decide, regardless of what we do with bitcoin. If bitcoin is not allowed the range of adaptation to find optimal answers to those questions, it will be supplanted.\n\n>To plan blocksize as we go, is the fatal conceit.  To leave it as is, and design around it, is the non-keynesian, hayakian rule.\n\nIt\'s already planned. I\'m saying we should "unplan" it. To create an artificial fee market due to an artificial restriction of supply is to subsidize the mining industry. (As a Hayekian, I\'m sure you see the connection here to the general concept of protectionism. I see this as an instance of protectionism.)

You need to look earlier in that thread; "We can phase in a change later if we get closer to needing it."\n\nHe clearly was OK with it.': 1, "Obviously both miners (in some cases) and people who make transactions want larger blocks, but the larger blocks are on average, the more expensive it is to run a full node in terms of bandwidth, CPU usage, and disk space. And full nodes do not (and, most experts believe, cannot reasonably) get any reward for supporting increased transaction volume. So in other words, block size is a negative externality suffered by full nodes due to the actions of miners and transaction-makers, and running full nodes is a positive externality provided by full nodes to the benefit of everyone who uses Bitcoin. And there's no reason to think that miners or transaction-makers would voluntarily keep blocks small enough -- since it's a common goods problem, neither has the right incentives.\n\nBitcoin's solution to this issue is for full nodes to enforce a max block size small enough to allow full nodes to operate with a reasonably low cost. Without the limit, the incentives of everyone on the network would be strongly aligned to reduce the number of full nodes as far as possible. It is immediately obvious that this would lead to a small group of centralized full nodes at some point, increasing centralization and therefore decreasing security/robustness. It is less obvious that this situation would *far more quickly* lead to problems because if most of the economy is backed by lightweight nodes, then *miners* don't have any strong incentive to actually enforce the rules of Bitcoin (the 21 million BTC limit, etc.), so all of Bitcoin becomes insecure and worthless.\n\nBitcoin is a delicate balance of incentives, and the max block size is a very important part of that.\n\n(BTW, experts agree that 2 MB blocks would be safe enough to not cause the above problems, which is why SegWit will increase the effective max block size to ~2MB in a couple months.)": 4, 'Nope.

Satoshi never responded.  More importantly scaling or change the block-size is far different than trying to maintain a coffee money scale.  \n\nSo if you start from a conclusion bitcoin needs to be a coffee money you might argue that was Satoshi's intent.  But if you look at the fact with no bias, he never said that.": 1, 'Yes and as I explained your definition of central planning is not inline with Hayek. A static block size is not central planning in regard to the fatal conceit.  You miss-apply the concept.

I didn\'t prove you to be wrong, but I suggested from my view that your "un-plan" is really a new plan.  I am less interested in suggesting you mean to create a plan, but rather that Satoshi\'s size of 1mb is not a "plan", but rather the opposite.  By plan remember we mean hayek\'s use, not just the word fit to an accepted definition.  To say this in another way just because you point to an actual plan, does not mean it is the fatal central planning hayek warned about.\n\nHayek is more talking about the CONTINUAL adjustment of something that cannot actually be optimized by continually adjusting it (planning). So from MY view, to leave the block size alone, is to end the central planning of it.  And yes in one way that means to make a plan of leaving it alone, but this avoid the very pitfall hayek suggests (imo!).  \n\nNow remember bitcoin is new, it doesn\'t perfectly align with what hayek was discussing.  But I can easily suggest we do not have the data to optimize blocksize.  The DIFFICULTY is that consensus for change gets more complex over time, so we cannot wait till we have the data, nor can we adjust it as we go.   We HAVE to lock something in place as we go, and we must do it sooner than later, so we are in dilemma.\n\nThat dilemma, with those difficulties render the problem closer to what Hayek talked about. Leave certain parameters alone, and let the natural order work around them (this is the opposite of central planning!).  The other way is to try to scale bitcoin to optimize the block size so that we can avoid things that we are not at all sure how to truly avoid this is the danger that people that think they will get rich if bitcoin scaled to visa avoid.  They are clouded by ignorance and greed. \n\nKeep in mind, although I am new to this myself, few of these peoples have read the literature.

So we are back at truth and reality.

First ill ask this:  What do you think we should "un-plan" the block-size too?\n\nNothing. No blocksize (*limit). If we did this, I expect that miners would set their fees to break even with a moderate profit margin (which would be competed down over time), as prices in a free market should be. Similarly, users would adapt their consumption based upon prices. Importantly, prices, in this case, would be reflective of scarcity of actual resources, which is the goal of the market -- to balance infinite demand against finite supply of resources.\n\nMiners who can\'t make enough revenue will fail. Users who think fees are too high will not consume. This is the way it should be as it ensures that resources are used optimally.': 1, 'If a handful of developers get to decide what the max blocksize should be, how is that a free market?  That is central planning. \n\nIn a truly free market each miner would get to decide the length of its blocks, and nodes would be free to decide what blocks to verify. ': 1, '> Have you heard of anyone studying the economics of such a configuration?\n\nI\'ve seen almost no serious economic study of any part of Bitcoin, unfortunately.\n\nFull nodes do provide certain network services, and maybe it\'d be reasonable for them to somehow charge for these services. For example, lightweight nodes rely on full nodes to filter blocks for them so that the lightweight nodes can easily find their own transactions, and maybe full nodes should charge for this service. Though this may encourage the development of a small handful of huge, cheap full nodes -- centralization is generally more efficient/cost-effective than decentralization, which is something that Bitcoin constantly has to fight against.\n\nThis is tangential to the main problem I described, though. Even if full nodes are charging for the services they provide, they are still economically disconnected from the activities of miners and transaction-makers which increase costs on full nodes. Transactions don\'t *need* to go through the Bitcoin P2P network -- they can be sent and received directly from miners.\n\nThe main issue is that the economy needs to have significant leverage/oversight over miners so that if they break the rules, the economy can decisively rejects their blocks. If there were only a few dozen "major" full nodes that almost everyone relied upon, I could easily see most of these full nodes cooperating with miners to break the rules or censor transactions. The only way I know of to ensure that miners are strongly incentivized not to break the rules is for a large chunk of the economy to actually check that blocks aren\'t breaking them, and absolutely reject them if they are (this is what full nodes do).\n\nCurrently, people are incentivized to use full nodes because there is better security (you\'ll never accept an invalid transaction as valid), it\'s easier to do certain things if you\'re a full node, it is probably cheaper than using a third-party API, and there are privacy advantages. But these advantages would be outweighed for increasing numbers of people/businesses if the cost of running a full node became significantly higher.\n\nIt is annoying that there are these arbitrary constants in Bitcoin. I actually complained to Satoshi when he added one such limit (the sigop limit). Like many people do today, I had the kneejerk reaction that any fixed limit is a form of central economic planning which is totally inappropriate for Bitcoin. But later I realized that as distasteful as it may be, a few "arbitrary" limits like this are probably necessary. Though hopefully at some point something more flexible and free-market than a constant max block size will be thought up and implemented. There are a few good proposals out there for this (as well as many bad proposals).\n\nOn the bright side:\n\n* There a number of huge inefficiencies in the Bitcoin network which, if fixed, would probably allow for a safe max block size of at least 4-8MB. This could successfully happen as soon as next year IMO.\n* Lightning, currently in development, seems very promising. Very roughly, Lightning is an attempt to "cache" transaction traffic within localities so that the vast majority of transactions don\'t actually have to hit the Bitcoin "backbone", somewhat like a (decentralized) CDN. (The "localities" won\'t just be geographic, though.)\n* One thing that can be done is to configure lightweight nodes to be able to accept "fraud proofs" produced by full nodes. These proofs would prove mathematically that a certain block chain is invalid according to the rules of Bitcoin, and then lightweight nodes would reject this invalid chain in favor of the next-longest chain. With fraud proofs, the economy could perhaps retain the ability to decisively reject rule violations by miners with just a small percentage of the economy backed by full nodes. Though for this to be secure, a lot of work would need to be done to ensure than an attacker can\'t partition lots of lightweight nodes from the fraud-proof-producing full nodes on the network.': 2}, ("Mycelium can't import xpub from Electrum.

They rightly perceive that there\'s something a little off about the way the world is and works, but don\'t see how insanely good they have it, despite everything.  They have so much, and have experienced so much at such a young age, that they almost have to deal with the jadedness of old men, while still in their 20\'s.  They want more but they don\'t even seem to really know what they want.  That\'s why employers right now are having to re-train their management to understand that millennials don\'t want to be rewarded; they want to be "inspired".\n\nThey are educated, but mostly in fact and knowledge. . .rather than wisdom; these people can\'t help but throw the baby out with the bathwater when it comes to applying principles from one area of thought, to another. They are they type of people who cannot see the forest for the trees.\nEverything, in their way of thinking, is a compartmentalized, largely unfathomable pattern, to be examined and explained independent of all other thought, intuition or theory, and worthlessly memorized in all its details, to no real avail. They cannot conceive of nor intuit that the pattern is just a piece of a much larger fractal, which permeates the macro as much as the micro, and produces more useful insights at different scales than what they have their noses in. \n\nAnd so they agitate, endlessly; within a broken context and paradigm but refuse to accept wisdom when it is offered, and wonder why nothing changes and why they aren\'t being inspired.  They won\'t accept of or perceive of universals and principles to guide action and intellect and temper emotion; so everything is a battle against an imagined tyranny upon which they project their fears and their hopes of breaking out of their self-inflicted boxes.  Behind every next door is the secret, the key to unlocking the solution to what is wrong with the world.  And so, they lash out almost blindly, looking for someone to blame (Wall St., Core Devs, etc.).  Everything in their life has come to them within an order of magnitude faster than things came to earlier generations; and so when they can\'t perceive the macro, the big picture, and their sense of time and patience is so skewed; they throw the whole game when they can\'t agitate for what they directly want within an arbitrary time-frame that they think is reasonable.\n\nBut that\'s just like, my opinion.': 1, 'Eh.
