I did play around with MPD a few years ago and a few services more recently. \n\nYay! Always happy to find people driven and learning Linux.\n\n> The main issue I can see is that services are "third-party" daemons right? By third-party I mean they would not be officially maintained by the kernel.\n\nIt\'s true that a third party would maintain it, that is the case for all services (so I\'m not sure where the issue is, but I\'ll attempt to tackle it anyways :p). SystemD would at least enable you to basically write it once, and it should work on all flavours of Linux though. So if you made a BIP for "Standardised Wallet Service for Linux" or something (idk if you\'d even need / want a BIP), and supported a bunch of wallets out of the box, that\'d probably achieve your goal (one standard to rule them all).\n\nJust keep in mind everything is maintained by people, the kernel just allows people to use their own modules and junk and drop stuff in. If you made a well-designed third-party standard and got into some official repos, you probably wouldn\'t have too much trouble finding other maintainers.\n\nAnother thing to clear up is services don\'t necessarily need the kernel to be aware they exist at all. To oversimplify, they\'re basically just loops that take shutdown and restart commands. I can\'t think of a simple Linux example anymore (thanks SystemD ...), but if you look into starting daemons on startup in FreeBSD, you\'ll see very transparently how simple it all really is. Another option (less transparent IMO but effective for what you want to know) is if you Googled like "apache2 systemd service file" you can see how easy it is to make a service file that\'d work on most Linux flavours.\n\nBeen a couple years since I\'ve answered any Linux questions so I apologize if anything is not current.': 2, "Happy to see Trisquel posted here. :)  It's a great OS and works really well on my Chromebook (Acer C720).\n\nFSF has also been [accepting Bitcoin donations](https://www.fsf.org/about/ways-to-donate/) for a while now too!": 1, 'Because he has no idea how Linux actually works.': 1, "Why not a service though?

Why would anyone in their right mind pay 400 dollars for a raspberry pi + an API wrapper?*\n\nThe 21Inc Bitcoin Computer is a fully functional bitcoin miner, a full bitcoin node and a micro-payments server. It has been rightly pointed about by many others that it is not economical using it as a standalone bitcoin miner \xe2\x80\x93 one source says you will be able to mine only $38 worth of bitcoins a year, and even that is not certain. 21 Inc has also acknowledged this fact. Another source says that the hardware included with this device is only worth $250 and thus the $399 is actually the price of the hardware + the included API and micro-payment server.\n\nIn my view the aim of 21 Inc is to enable hobbyists and developers come on to the blockchain and start using the (21 Inc + bitcoin) ecosystem to create applications and trade on it via micropayments. 21 Inc is maybe aiming to create a bitcoin platform on which a lot of applications are built using their APIs. If there are a lot of people having the 21 Inc device, it would be very easy for them (with the right kind of applications built on top) to transact with each other using bitcoins for micropayments. At this point in time, to my knowledge, there is no single platform which enables bitcoin transactions using a standard API which allows applications to be built on top of it without charging any transaction fee (happy to be corrected if wrong).\n\nOk so why not build a library of APIs and publish it instead of selling a piece of hardware? The issue with that is that it will have to integrate with a host of bitcoin wallets where the end users will end up paying a transaction fee. It will still not address the issue of privacy and anonymity (as the wallet provider knows who you really are).\n\nIf this device gets smaller and faster (which it should with time due to Moore's law) then you could potentially plug it to your cellphone or refrigerator as a USB drive and thus enable e-commerce on this basis. In the future, this will also enable the IOTs (Internet of Things).\n\nIn my view bitcoin micropayments with minimal transaction fees is the key objective of this device.\n\n*When there is hardly any Bitcoins I can mine using this device, then what's the difference between using this computer and running a full node on a normal computer? Why include a miner in this in the first place?*\n\nLet us look at the alternatives of being able to mine (remember that the 21 Inc computer is a full bitcoin node, meaning it is a miner and wallet rolled into one):\nIf we have an API sitting over the top of a bitcoin wallet enabing payments, we have no anonymity and privacy. There will be an additional transaction fee which will be a killer deal for micropayments. In fact this is not a viable option as using a wallet means you have handed over your details to the \xe2\x80\x9ccentralized\xe2\x80\x9d wallet provider who can track each and every payment you send or receive. You can also look at an option of using multiple such 21 Inc computers which you use to be truly anonymous and decentralized instead of hooking yourself on to a central wallet.\nUsing your computer to mine bitcoins on its own and take/send payments is possible, however you will have to set up a micropayments server and wallet to get started, which leads to issues as I described above for the wallet, and challenges in setting up a micropayment server to work with minimal transaction fee. A developer does not need to spend 20-25 hours setting this up and then buying bitcoins from other sources, which is worth atleast $150 in time saved \xe2\x80\x93 the assumed saving you can make if you go the DIY route.\nThe most important reason in my view to include a miner is to enable a large ecosystem of miners which will process micropayments at nearly zero cost. Most miners will not process micropayments today and this will mean tha those transactions are delayed and slow. The 21 Inc computer will enable a lot of mining power to be allocated for micropayments.": 1, "Could someone ELI5 on why I would want it?

BitAccess manufactures bitcoin ATMs, they have to build in a lot of functionality so that independent operators can run the machines in their own jurisdictions.

Therefore, facial recognition is a "feature" that BitAccess is all too happy to advertise.\n\nMany times, various buy or sell requirements can be customized by the operator to suit whatever needs they have as a business. I was involved in the setup of a Genesis Coin machine where the operator customized the levels of verification needed for different purchase amount tiers.\n\nSo, my point is, basically, any time Bitcoin has to interface with fiat you are going to run into these hurdles.

This is a slight paradox, in that the more notional a token is, it is simultaneously more concrete as money and less concrete as anything else. Credit money (fiat) was a great advancement precisely because of how notional it is. Credit money by computer is an advancement of degree but not of kind.  \n\nBitcoin (or its successors) is great advancement in money again.  I truly believe that.  A single accessible transaction record of bearer units with perfect immutability and adhoc usability is such a superior creature to matching double entry accounting credit money via credit institutions, it is hard to emphasize it enough.\n\nBank money is heavily burdened with problems and inefficiencies. These create an enourmous drag and interference on commerce.\n\nIf we think that a child with reasonable environments and resource will be capable as any other, and we postulate the net capacity of humanity's productive capacity with borderless commerce free from the burden of bank money, we can see a much much wealthier (in real terms) planet.

People will use Bitcoin (or again its progeny), quite universally.  While there may be need for different types and some may come and go, there will never be more than a large handful of global voluntary currencies.  \n\nI want Bitcoin to succeed, but even I am amazed at how little impact on the overall ecosystem comes from very compelling alternatives.  If Etherium had first mover status, there would be zero need of Bitcoin. \n\nSo what proportion of wealth of an enabled free-to-be-wealthy globe will be held in voluntary money. Quite a lot I think.

We tend to think of bitcoin being in an address, but the reality is that you have unspent transaction outputs which can be spent by anyone who can provide inputs to satisfy a script associated with that transaction output. The usual convention is to specify a script involving an address that can be satisfied by having the key associated with that address. \n\nIf you extended the scripting language to support addresses backed by a different signing schemes, the bitcoin block chain could simultaneously accommodate multiple signing mechanisms. This is why addresses are all prefixed with a version string. \n\nAdditionally, bitcoin addresses are a hash of a public key. The public key isn't widely available until the first time you spend coins from that address. Any realistic attacks are going to be deriving the private key from the public key, but deriving the public key from the address isn't really viable. So long as deriving a private key from a public key takes more than the time to verify a few blocks, coins would be safe so long as you moved all coins from an address at once, as nobody would have the public key for the new address, just the hash.

For the sake of our economy, the major banks must be broken up."', 189): {'You may be right, but my impression is that Bernie\'s consciousness is rooted in favoring decentralization, even if there is the basic contradiction you raise. The basic concern of Bernie is that ordinary people be empowered and that society decentralize the massive concentration of power that is happening at the top. Breaking up the banks is, fundamentally, an act of decentralization. Favoring the many over the few is pro-decentralization, building a grassroots campaign not financed by corporations is pro-decentralization. \n\nBut you are right that top-down, centrally planned governance is antithetical to the kind of decentralization realized by Bitcoin. And this is why I am not so sure that Bernie is as wedded to this idea of "big-government" as you imply, because it contradicts the basic spirit of the man. I would offer the suggestions that the reason Bernie is a democratic socialist has more to do with that that was really the twentieth century\'s way of attempting to achieve decentralization pre-internet, the idea being that government is representational and therefore beholden to, and capable of, working for ordinary people.  In short, Bernie was simply ahead of his time and thus was forced to adopt an ideology, a lesser of evils, that wasn\'t truly harmonious with his thinking. Big government isn\'t and wasn\'t the desired end, the desired end was more power for ordinary people. It just so happens that in the twentieth century the only way people on the Left could imagine achieving this was, unfortunately, through big representational government. \n\nToday, however, you have social networks like Twitter, for instance, empowering people directly, without the need for proxy representation via an institution like government. The internet is really what allows us to adopt the idea of direct empowerment and radical decentralization without the need for power institutions to represent us. Not only would Bernie\'s campaign not have even been possible prior to the internet, but he is only one of two candidates in the entire running who considers Snowden a hero (the other being Rand Paul). If he is really so wedded to the ideology of big government, why is he one of the only candidates deeply against the surveillance state? \n\nThe reason is because Bernie isn\'t actually wedded to the idea of big government, he is wedded to the idea of empowering ordinary people. Big government was always only a means to an end, a means that more and more people on the Left are realizing doesn\'t work particularly well and is a double edged sword. These people would surround Bernie if he got elected, young people are Bernie\'s main demographic. Bernie is an old man, and so he has certain old labels attached to his image, like "socialist", but his administration would be very young and very forward thinking, I believe, and internet representation would be huge in a Sanders administration. I would not be at all surprised if such influences lead to quite a lot of evolution of Bernie\'s own thinking, and I doubt very much that Bitcoin, which does empower ordinary people, would find a threat in Bernie Sanders. Just the opposite probably. ': 5, '[deleted]': 2, 'Yeah, but maybe we should only post about politicians when it relates to Bitcoin?\n\nThis is a sound bite to promote Sanders.

If a high candidate (currently) for future President of the U.S. is antagonistic towards Wall Street to the extent that Sanders is, this can be a good thing to minimize their political power and ability to fight off competitive threats like Bitcoin. At the very least, comments like this should put fear into Wall Street, as maybe it wouldn\'t be the same old same old for them, and make them think twice before making statements so casually like Jamie did re: Bitcoin.\n\nFor that reason, this deserves to be promoted, whether or not you agree with his views or think he can actually change anything (I\'m apolitical, personally -- I don\'t think politicians can really achieve anything significant in the U.S.).': 4, 'A lot of things posted in this sub have nothing to do with bitcoin.

Technologically, Bitcoin addresses the inefficiencies of traditional payment systems, such as expensive transaction fees, widespread fraud, and slow money transfers. Economically, Bitcoin addresses the requirement of a trusted third party for financial transactions as well as government control of the money supply.\n\n**Who owns the Bitcoin network?**\nNo one person or organization owns the Bitcoin network. Like the Internet it is built upon, Bitcoin is decentralized, and no single entity controls how it operates or how bitcoins are distributed and spent. This is unique in modern-day currencies, all of which are created and controlled by governments. The running and development of Bitcoin is based upon consensus, meaning that the users of Bitcoin decide how it will operate and function.\n\n**How is Bitcoin superior to this credit card payment system?**\nBitcoin uses a completely different model for payment, one that is more like cash. When you transfer bitcoins to another person, all you give him are those specific bitcoins. He has no way to access any more of your bitcoins. You don\xe2\x80\x99t even have to give him your name or contact information if it is not required for the purchase. It\xe2\x80\x99s just like giving a $20 bill to the cashier \xe2\x80\x93 but it can all be done electronically. Bitcoin, however, also works like cash in that it is non-reversible: once you transfer those bitcoins, there is no way to get them back unless the other party agrees to send them to you.\n\n\nThe answers in the book build on each other throughout the book; for example, the answer to "Why was Bitcoin created?" raised a number of issues, which are then answered in separate questions later.
