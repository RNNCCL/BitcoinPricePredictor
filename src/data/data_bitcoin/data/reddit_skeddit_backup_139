It is very resistant to change that doesn't have essentially unanimous support.\n\nSolutions other than a hard fork then?\n\nSoft fork?  Spin-off altcoin?\n\nI really think the spin-off altcoin is the quickest way to get a big block Bitcoin going.   It can be launched with just a tiny fraction of Bitcoin's mining.   It gives everyone holding bitcoin the equivalent number of coin on the spin-off.  It doesn't impact Bitcoin (original chain). \n\nAnyone can launch one.   Hopefully, those with bitcoins at exchanges and custodial wallets will be given enough time in advance to get their coins into their own wallet so as to not forfeit the ability to spend/claim the associated spin-off altcoin.\n\nHere's some info on the topic:\n\nhttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=563972.0\n\nhttps://github.com/sfultong/bitcoin-spinoff-toolkit": 1, "No. The data on the paper wallet is, in all cases I know of, just seed data that is used to generate addresses in a deterministic manner. Short of ECDSA becoming hopelessly broken or some other catastrophic event, any proposal to nullify those keys would have about as much chance of gaining an economic majority as Houdini has of rising from the grave.

For the past years, we've enjoyed very low fees ($0.05 or less), but as more people start using bitcoin, they will need to increase their fee in order to get the transaction included in a block.  If you have to pay $5 to get your transaction confirmed, then it will become cost prohibitive for many users.\n\nIf your paper wallet only stores $5 and you have to pay that towards fees in order to spend/transfer it, your bitcoin essentially becomes worthless.  Now, keep in mind the exchange rate of bitcoin will also change.  If it costs more to transact, there will may be fewer people willing to pay the fees unless there are compelling and offsetting reasons to use bitcoin.": 2, "Thanks, that's what I thought, but as I'm not that technical I wasn't completely sure.": 2, 'Thanks for taking the time to explain this.

So either both nodes & miners will move to that implementation, and/or maybe Core too will agree to include those different/new rules about blocksize, and that will be Bitcoin. And again, nothing happens.": 3, '+1': 1, '> Now consider that exchanges and custodial wallets stand to make a killing off of catastrophic consensus failure. If instead of cold storage you had your pre-fork bitcoins at Coinbase, and they simply "follow the chain with the most work", then you are back to where your pre-fork coins are spendable only on the big blocks/hard fork chain (i.e., worth only $300, using the fabricated amount in the example above). A hard fork without consensus is like giving a bailout to exchanges and custodial wallets.\n\nThis is completely wrong. Custodial wallets are effected by a fork in the same way any other wallet is effected by a fork.\n\nAfter a fork there will be three kinds of bitcoin: prefork coins (spendable on both chains), post-fork small block coins (only spendable on the small blockchain), and post-fork big block coins (only spendable on the big block fork).\n\nIf the fork lingers, those three types of coins will probably have different values. Some merchants may not want coins that can\'t be spent on the big block, and vice versa. Coins that have the same owner on both chains will be universally accepted by everyone.\n\nPre-fork coins will probably be worth the most, post fork coins will be worth less. If the market thinks the big block is more likely to survive, post-fork big block coins will be worth more than small block post-fork coins.\n\nI don\'t think the fork will linger for too long, as the big block chain is more usable since it can confirm your transaction quicker and with less fees. If a fork actually does happen, it\'ll be like y2k; there will be a lot of hype, but when it actually happens, it\'ll be the biggest non-event.\n\nThe only people who lose anything during a fork are the miners who waste electricity mining the fork that eventually gets abandoned.': 2, "No one's talking about changing anything that would make a difference for coins kept in cold storage": 9, "No, it's not silly. \n\nYou don't have to do anything.

However up to now, backwards compatibility was always a concern and it will likely be in future.\n\nThe biggest threat could come from high fees by the community not allowing more room in the block chain: at some point you can't spend your paper wallet economically any more.": 0, 'The problem is, you don\'t choose.  If a hard fork occurs yet mining continues on the original chain then your pre-fork bitcoins are spendable on both chains -- regardless of whether or not you wanted them to be spent on both.\n\nSo to directly answer your question, if you spend your cold storage using Bitcoin-XT, Unlimted, or Classic, it won\'t matter -- that transaction will also confirm on the original chain.\n\nWhy is that a problem?   Well, what if BTCs (bitcoins / original chain) are still trading at $100, and BT?s (big block hard fork coins / Bitcoin-XT, Unlimited, or Classic) trade at $300?     So you use Bitcoin Classic to send 1.0 of coin from your cold storage wallet to an exchange and sell at $300.     Except with that transaction the exchange just got two coins -- one you sold at $300, the other worth $100 that you no longer have because you sent it to the exchange when you spent from your cold storage.   So you get shortchanged by $100 doing this.\n\nA solution would be to buy a tiny bit of coin mined after the hard fork and taint your cold storage funds (which can be skillfully done with Bitcoin Classic, for example).   Then you can spend the funds independently -- getting the full $400 of value that your cold storage funds held.\n\nMessy?   You bet!  It is messy because Bitcoin isn\'t supposed to work that way.  The situation where mining continues on the original chain after a fork is called "catastrophic consensus failure".  \n\nAnd anyone posting code for a hard fork that doesn\'t require consensus (e.g., activates with less than 95% of hashing on it) is acting irresponsibly and is guilty of creating this potential mess. \n\nNow consider that exchanges and custodial wallets stand to make a killing off of catastrophic consensus failure.    If instead of cold storage you had your pre-fork bitcoins at Coinbase, and they simply "follow the chain with the most work", then you are back to where your pre-fork coins are spendable only on the big blocks/hard fork chain (i.e., worth only $300, using the fabricated amount in the example above).   A hard fork without consensus is like giving a bailout to exchanges and custodial wallets.\n\nA bailout == free money!   Why wouldn\'t they be all for it!     Hell, they\'ld be happy with 51% majority activation even -- as that would make the coin on the original chain worth even more!  Maybe a value equal to the hard fork coin, initially.': -1, "> The biggest threat could come from high fees by the community not allowing more room in the block chain: at some point you can't spend your paper wallet economically any more.  \n  \nCan you give an example?": 1, "> If you're worried, just leave them there until the dust settles.\n\nSadly if your dust is less than 5460 satoshis it will never settle. \n\n:)": 3}, ('Censored: front page thread about Bitcoin Classic', 807): {'Bitcoin Classic is an altcoin as far as I\'m concerned.

In fact, if you treat the refund address as a 'suggestion' and ask the customer to provide it using another means, then this enables the Marketplace Trader attack, outlined in the paper. \n\nThe Payment Protocol is not an AML tool, that is correct and very important to highlight.

The judge did a complete 360 on her position. Almost as if someone told her to void the line of questioning.\n\n/u/Cedar_floor 's comment is also incredibly true. There was crucial evidence involving the credibility of the agents involved with the collection of evidence against Ross. They could have EASILY delayed the trial a few weeks. The Judge chose not to.": 1, 'Well said. ': 3, 'How can you make fun out of this you fucking worthless shit. I am done talking to you psychopath. ': 0, 'Honestly, the man deserves his case to be thrown out for major conflict of interest. I believe that all of cases Force was on should be looked at again. ': 5, 'None of that stuff was sold there. ': 2, 'The judge actually used it as part of the sentence. Know your facts. ': 2, "He was not convicted of that. He's in jail for the drug stuff.": 8, 'Plus, the judge was super fucking corrupt.': 2, "> the child porn, hitmen listings, weapons, stolen identities... none of this is his own responsibility , poor guy. \n\nIndependant vendors. SR was a platform. You don't blame the Manhattan Project for someone else's decision to drop the bomb. That's the price of true freedom.\n\nThe hitman listings were unverified and not one case of their use has surfaced, nor do I recall seeing CP on SR at any point in time.\n\nIdentity theft stuff and carding equipment? Yeah Okay. I will acknowledge I'm not a fan of that, but freedom is freedom. Ross's platform was about liberty through capitalism. Besides in this sub we should be acknowledging that CC's are insecure and easily faked, hence why we use Bitcoin.": 9, "I must've missed that part. Can you explain to me why?\n\nEdit. No explanation, just downvotes. Surprising. ": 3, 'Don\'t be a fool.. SR was all about money, just a reminder, the site wasn\'t a "decentralized platform" but it was controlled/owned by Ross Ulbricht, they charged a fee for escrow, sales, accounts... and had paid mods that managed the daily operations and made sure the site would function normally.\n\nPlease don\'t mix freedom and liberty with criminal activity and low morals and values.': 0, 'I visited it only once and I think it was in 2012, and I remember plenty of drugs and few weapons, but at the time of the bust in 2013 when it was on the news everyone was talking about weapons, hitmen, drugs and child porn, stolen credit cards, fake IDs and passports... I never had the chance to verify because the site was offline at the time.': 0, "I don't know what the 2nd amendment is about, I am not an American... but I would argue that we have plenty of freedom in Europe... I would even go further and claim that it is even better than the illusion of freedom you have there in the USA.": 0, "Judge Forrest is the federal judge who sentenced Ross Ulbricht to life imprisonment without parole for his role in the silk road. Thing is, the evidence of Force and Bridges' extortion under double-agent pseudonyms (ones that the FBI was unaware of) existed during Ross' trial. Ross' defense was denied the ability to use this evidence during trial. Note also that he was originally charged with procuring murder. This assassination was actually ordered by one of the agent's pseudonyms, and the target was his other pseudonym.": 2, "Honestly the guy deserves another trial. The Force/Bridges thing was going on concurrently with his trial and therefore the court would not allow that evidence in court. Now that they've been convicted, the tables have turned.\n\nIt will be interesting to see if Ulbricht is released before Force or Bridges lol.": 11, 'Yes, because having a drug dealer cooking meth and selling it in your house should not be your responsibility... not to mention the child porn, hitmen listings, weapons, stolen identities... none of this is his own responsibility , poor guy.   ': -9, 'Trumped up': 0, "... that's why you like child porn?  That's pretty sick.": -1, "Let's just forget about the guys he attempted to have killed.. He'd be in jail for life even without all the drug stuff.": -6, 'Should people who just run pedo sharing sites go to jail?': 0, 'Actually you should forget about it given that he was essentially blackmailed into following that path by the corrupt government agents. This is generally considered entrapment.': 2, "Well, if you don't see any problem with child porn, identity theft,  illegal weapons (or weapons in general in fact), organized crime... then for sure you won't see any problem from exploiting it for profits. \n\nWhether you are straight or gay or bisexual and whether you use drugs or not it remains your personal freedom/problem call it as you wish (although the latter means that you are an idiot IMO, but this is a long debate and I don't have time to discuss it here), everything else that effects not only you but also people's lives in a negative way shouldn't be allowed. \n\nYou can argue about your personal freedom and space, but I don't want to live in a world where my kids are used sexually or where my identity is being stolen or where you can hire someone to kill me for any reason or where my life is danger because of your freedom... if this is your definition of freedom and liberty, then I don't wish to live in the same society with your kind of people.

You are a good little statist": 1, 'Ross Ulbricht was the guy who run the site not the one who sell those stuff on the internet, he may not be prisoned for lifetime': 7, 'Not across all of Europe.  depending on which country in Europe, you do have a point.\n': 1, 'Child porn was forbidden.': 1, 'do you have kids ? talk to me about how you feel about this subject when you have kids of your own.': 0, "It won't change the crimes he went to jail for. \n\nInstead of downvoting the fuck out of me because you disagree with me why don't you tell me where i'm wrong instead?": -2}}}
