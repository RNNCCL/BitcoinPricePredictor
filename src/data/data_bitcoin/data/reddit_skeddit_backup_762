If I create NovauriCoin^TM (I\'m not doing that, by the way), as a sidechain, lock up, say 1,000,000 BTC on the peg, and start mining using an amorphous hashing algorithm that rotates scrypt, SHA256, and some other magic stuff I pretend invented in my basement that makes ASICS less viable, and decentralizes mining economics, and my NovauriCoin^TM takes off, great for me.  Does that hurt bitcoin?  Absolutely. I become an offramp to a new currency.  Will I be able to do this?  Absolutely not.  This wouldn\'t be one iota different than if I created an altcoin NovauriCoin^TM and sold NovauriCoin^TM for bitcoin just like Ethereum did on a website with Ether.  The fact that we\'re pegging bitcoin to NovauriCoin^TM has fundamentally the same market effects as if I asked people to give me Bitcoin in exchange for NovauriCoin^TM, and then sold the bitcoin on open markets.  The net result is the value of bitcoin would decline, (assuming I sold it), and NovauriCoin^TM would gain value, assuming it has new and exciting uses for people.\n\nI actually think it\'s a net net of zero vs. today\'s alt coins.  The fact that my sidechain also has a pegged return value to the original bitcoin peg gives a floor or collateral to its value in bitcoin though, which creates a residual incentive to invest in the bitcoin currency.  The "insurance" for the value of my sidechain is denominated in bitcoin.  This is not at all unlike the cementing of the US currency unit as the world\'s reserve currency by requiring sale of petrol to occur in dollars, i.e. the petrodollar.  Again, if NovauriCoin ^TM goes bananas and everyone buys it with their fiat instead of bitcoin, this petrodollar effect diminishes, but the core developers of bitcoin can simply fork my NovauriCoin ^TM features into bitcoin core anyway, not unlike CounterParty just did with Ethereum!\n\nAll I have done with NovauriCoin^TM in the end was creating a parallel evolutionary track that benefited core bitcoin in the end regardless, and acted as a test bed. \n\n>Blockstream has every incentive to encourage this. as a for profit beholden to investors, not only do they have an incentive, they have an obligation.\n\nAbove comments apply.': 1, 'Currency is still and will be the foreseeable future the most important application of the blockchain.

Therefore, you can make the argument that the bankers at the top responsible for the fraud were rewarded for "cheating" because they got away with it and profited off of the losses of others.  The incentive to cheat is therefore propagated and rewarded again and again because the reward of a ton of money is worth the seemingly small risk of being caught and punished by the regulators.\n\nWith Bitcoin, the incentives aren\'t aligned for cheating.  I\'m talking about miners here - i.e those that control the network.  Any miner that gains control of the network and executes a 51% will be spotted by other miners in the network, and their blockchain would be ignored, thus only allowing them to "cheat" the system out of a few targeted transactions before being caught.  Additionally, the miners that put in the effort to gain 51% of the network would be better off just mining normally -- because the Bitcoin incentive makes playing by the rules the logical and more profitable choice to do.  \n\nScams like selling pointless mining contracts have nothing to do with Bitcoin..they are their own separate entity and that was not what I was referring to.

You speak as if the regulators have any modicum of sanity, and that they don\'t exist only to protect the status quo and the entrenched/established monopolies. Even then, those established players don\'t have to follow the regulations themselves... they just get a little slap on the wrist if they disobey, showing that the regulations exist simply to stop competition. Take a look at the BitLicense regulations -- what was it, 26 pages long?? -- and you let me know if there is ANYTHING in there that allows for ANY sort of personal freedoms, technological innovations, or allows for a competitive landscape to the current criminal banking cartel. Technology can produce better consumer protection solutions than regulations, such as CoinBase\'s excellent implementation of multi-sig.  Any regulations, if they arrive, should be delayed until the Bitcoin industry is more mature and we can all UNDERSTAND exactly what regulations need to be in place.

Purchasing bitcoin is not at all similar to "buying debt" in a payment system. It\'s more like buying gold that you think/know someone else will need/want to transact with in the future.

I dont know everything that goes on in the banking community, and Im not allowed to disclose everything I know.\n\nThe banks decisions to close exchanges accounts does make some sense from their perspective, for several different reasons. One of them is because bitcoin is the first real competition they have had in several hundred years. The banking community is very old and prefers business as usual - if something have been making them money for the last 200 years, why change it?\n\nAnother reason is the risk for money laundering, the Swedish Finansinspektionen (Financial Supervisory Authority) sees bitcoin as a high risk market for money laundering (http://www.affarsvarlden.se/hem/nyheter/article3673293.ece Article in Swedish only, sorry). Therefore the banks dont want to risk doing business with the exchanges. The extra profit gained by them for having a bitcoin exchange as a customer, simply isnt worth it, because the risk of them getting in trouble is simply to great. Im not sure if this is a real threat to them or not, but at least it seems like they think so.\n\nDoes this mean that it is game over, and we just need to give up once all banks have closed all the bitcoin exchanges bank accounts? No, as long as the exchanges are able to accept payments in some way it will still be possible to exchange bitcoins. Still, it will may be more and more cumbersome for the customers to do the exchange, perhaps up to a point where it will be almost to difficult for the general public to obtain bitcoin. So its paramount that we change this development as soon as possible.\n\nSo, what can we, as a community, do to fix this?

Ask your employer to get your pay check in bitcoin, every time you go into a store, ask if they accept bitcoin as a payment method, every time you're paying a bill, give the company a call and ask about paying it using bitcoin.

That's the problem with wealth inequality.\n\nI wasn't arguing that this isn't thew case. I was simply explaining that it is unavoidable and has been all throughout history. There is no way to change this....I mean really you can't just say the top bitcoin holders don't deserve their coins...because they do....whether from getting in early or from investing their hard earned money from elsewhere. Inequality is simply a fact of life. I'm also willing to argue the world will be better off when the current top bitcoin holders are part of the worlds wealthy elite vs how things are now.

Not appropriate. \n\nI believe along with bitcoin a paradigm shift is coming however. Not only a paradigm shift but a true shift of power to people with better intentions. I can envision a world in the future where those truly in need will get the help that they deserve.
