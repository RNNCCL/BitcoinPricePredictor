Even if performance of single-thread linear code execution is slightly slower, strong concurrency primitives which make it easier to implement parallelism and take advantage of multiple cores usually results in more code which actually does so.

This requires a different approach. There's one advantage every artist has over the pirate merchants. That is their fanbase. Your fans like you, not the pirate merchant.\n\nYes, that's the gist of it. Treat your fans as your allies. You can ask them favors. For example, you could ask them to promote your official site or even your OpenBazaar site. Then release new artwork as your goals are being met.\n\nAlso, don't even think about DRM. Using that crap is treating your fans like enemies. They'll be much less likely to want to help like that. No matter how much they like your art, if the DRM makes it useless to them, they most definitely won't pay. They might even hail the pirate who removes it as their savior.\n\nWhy would they help, you ask? They're your fans, they want you to keep creating and publishing great work. These are the people who value your work greatly.

On the other hand if the project is at 90% funding then you will see a glut of fans appear who may have not originally paid for the album fund it just to make it available, the use of campaign timers have been shown to be massively successful in forcing consumers hands. Overall it is a win for the artist. \n\n2. The market on digital content isnt 100% controlled by piracy, judging from the massive profitability reported by RIAA and MPAA groups its not that big of a problem at all. Why doesnt everyone pirate?

The internet has changed the playing field so that the artist can have the upper hand if he/she knows how.\n\nThe goal of what I described is not to make pirate merchants vanish. Rather the goal is to ensure that any fan who wants to support the artist and enjoy the art in a format they want, is able to do both.\n\nIf your definition of solving the pirate issue is no pirating at all, please come out of your dream bubble. That\'s just not realistic without a police state and possibly not even then.\n\nThere\'s no point in vilifying pirates. Glorify people who support the artist instead.\n\nAs for OpenBazaar. It\'s a system whose usefulness will grow with increasing adoption. I don\'t know if OB will be the marketplace of the future or not, but it certainly has the potential.\n\nOB is more of a marketplace protocol rather than a marketplace in itself. The openness of it allows anyone to both participate as well as make use of the market data. It could well become something I\'m not even able to imagine yet.\n\nAs for why someone should use it. It\'s an additional channel that will reach some audience unreachable through the other options you listed. Whether it reaches enough people to be worthwhile to use, I ca\'t say.\n\nFor example, I know several who\'ve actually deleted their facebook accounts. They prefer not giving so much information about themselves to facebook.\n': 1, '>You\'re the one claiming it can be solved, not me.\n\nYes, and I was pointing out that it seems we have differing definitions for what it means to solve this problem. I\'m unable to figure out what exactly it means for you but for me the problem is solved if the result is a system where artists can make a living.\n\n>How is it a better deal to hand over 50%, rather than handing over zero?\n\nHanding over, even 50%, is a good deal if (and only if) your number of customers increases enough that you make more profit than before. Very simple. Whether it\'s sensible to ask for as much as 50% depends on that.\n\nWhat I explained assumes the goods in question are physical. For example T-shirts with the artist\'s art on them. For digital goods, there\'s no way someone would pay a pirate for those when there are ways to get them for free.\n\nIn the T-shirt example, the ideal system (from my perspective anyway), would be one where the customer pays the artist directly rather than requiring royalties from middlemen who manufacture the physical product. That way the customer could be sure the artist received a sensible share of the money he/she spent.\n\nIn the current model, even when buying from the so called legitimate merchants, you have no way of knowing if the artist is actually getting as much as you think he/she should.\n\nSuppose you, as a customer, see a legitimate shop selling the thing for $120 and another (possibly a pirate) for $60. You also know from a reliable source that they\'re of comparable quality. Manufacture costs are likely around $40. Handling and shipping $15.\n\nBecause you like the artist and would like to support him/her, you are considering the $120 product. However, lets do some math here. There\'s at least $65 portion of the price that\'s "extra" on top of the physical service. The artist will receive some portion of this.\n\nNow the, question is, how much? Will he/she even get $10? Are you sure you want to pay $60 extra so the artist can get $10? For me, hell no, I\'d rather pay the artist $20 directly and buy the $60 product. There are quite some purchases I didn\'t make because this wasn\'t possible.\n\n>There\'s even less point in helping or rewarding people who steal from you.\n\nIt\'s your choice to see them as enemies. They don\'t have to be that. What I\'m suggesting is a different approach. Do note, though, that what I\'m suggesting won\'t reward or help them before they stop doing what you call stealing.\n': 1, '>In what uncomfortable position do you need to read my text to interpret a part of it as "ask if the pirates will be nice enough"? It\'s not relying on the pirates being nice.

As it stands, every transaction added to a block causes that block to be larger in size and thus delayed by a few milliseconds in getting around the world to the rest of the network.  Every millisecond delay is a millisecond a different miner could beat them with a different block being accepted by the network first. Even though the chance is low: If they were beat, even by a few milliseconds, the miner loses all the rewards of the block = 25+ BTC. So the miner is weighing the risk of losing all 25 BTC in rewards with the potential benefit of earning a few pennies USD including transactions.  Its a free market of sorts. Miners willing to take the risk will edge down to including the lower fee transactions.  The is part of the Game of Bitcoin playing out in Game Theory. So if the system was changed to propagate blocks at the same speed regardless of number of transactions, then I think you'd see many miners including 0 fee transactions or MUCH LOWER fee transactions - why? Because if there's no longer a negative risk in processing thousands of transactions in a block, then the miner can now switch to considering his/her personal interest the the success of Bitcoin, and processing tiny transactions (a.k.a. having micropayments work with Bitcoin) would contribute to Bitcoin's success.": 1, 'Did you even read the linked description of a micropayment channel?': 3, 'Could there be a system that implements promissory notes, rather than a deposit "banking" method?
