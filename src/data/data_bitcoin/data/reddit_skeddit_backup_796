May <tcmay@netcom.com>\n>\n>A specter is haunting the modern world, the specter of crypto anarchy.\n>\n>Computer technology is on the verge of providing the ability for individuals and groups to communicate and interact with each other in a totally anonymous manner. Two persons may exchange messages, conduct business, and negotiate electronic contracts without ever knowing the True Name, or legal identity, of the other. Interactions over networks will be untraceable, via extensive re- routing of encrypted packets and tamper-proof boxes which implement cryptographic protocols with nearly perfect assurance against any tampering. Reputations will be of central importance, far more important in dealings than even the credit ratings of today. These developments will alter completely the nature of government regulation, the ability to tax and control economic interactions, the ability to keep information secret, and will even alter the nature of trust and reputation.\n>\n>The technology for this revolution--and it surely will be both a social and economic revolution--has existed in theory for the past decade. The methods are based upon public-key encryption, zero-knowledge interactive proof systems, and various software protocols for interaction, authentication, and verification. The focus has until now been on academic conferences in Europe and the U.S., conferences monitored closely by the National Security Agency. But only recently have computer networks and personal computers attained sufficient speed to make the ideas practically realizable. And the next ten years will bring enough additional speed to make the ideas economically feasible and essentially unstoppable. High-speed networks, ISDN, tamper-proof boxes, smart cards, satellites, Ku-band transmitters, multi-MIPS personal computers, and encryption chips now under development will be some of the enabling technologies.\n>\n>The State will of course try to slow or halt the spread of this technology, citing national security concerns, use of the technology by drug dealers and tax evaders, and fears of societal disintegration. Many of these concerns will be valid; crypto anarchy will allow national secrets to be trade freely and will allow illicit and stolen materials to be traded. An anonymous computerized market will even make possible abhorrent markets for assassinations and extortion. Various criminal and foreign elements will be active users of CryptoNet. But this will not halt the spread of crypto anarchy.\n>\n>Just as the technology of printing altered and reduced the power of medieval guilds and the social power structure, so too will cryptologic methods fundamentally alter the nature of corporations and of government interference in economic transactions. Combined with emerging information markets, crypto anarchy will create a liquid market for any and all material which can be put into words and pictures. And just as a seemingly minor invention like barbed wire made possible the fencing-off of vast ranches and farms, thus altering forever the concepts of land and property rights in the frontier West, so too will the seemingly minor discovery out of an arcane branch of mathematics come to be the wire clippers which dismantle the barbed wire around intellectual property.\n>\n>Arise, you have nothing to lose but your barbed wire fences!': 21, '[Bitcoin: An Experiment in Anarchism](http://youtu.be/hPY-5SR-jPQ)': 1, 'You have no idea what counter party risk is do you? \n\nUsing counter party risk as an argument for bitcoin is hilariously stupid.

If you use bitcoin in the most primitive way, a doubling of your profit margin is possible in low margin situation. Reinvent your business in a decentralized manner and not only can you offer a superior product, you can offer your product for much lower prices. This will result in bitcoin businesss (or blockchain businesses) starting to cannibalize the traditional companies. \n\nBut on the consumer front, I really don't have any worries. All bitcoin needs to do is survive. That's it. The price doesn't even need to appreciate. If it can do just that, people will not be able to dismiss it. They WILL conclude that it has staying power and that it is legitimate. Perception is a large factor where adoption is concerned. Right now, bitcoin is new.

Again, people see blue boxes.\n\n3) The "Banc de Bitcoin" logo is un-readable in the two smaller banners.\n\n4) the HUGE banners are wasted. There\'s place for photos, more text etc. A 300 x 600 could have a small world inside it. I guess they are VERY expensive.... use all that space !

I understand your business model might not work without this, but I think it does not work due to this.

Without paying a 10% premium. At least that\'s the impression I get as a new customer - once the two-day verification process starts taking a week, I\'m already somewhat commited.\n\nAlso, in the first step, you offer a lot of payment options. Once I click buy, it\'s credit card only. VERY BAD: In general, credit cards are not a very common payment instrument in Germany. In stores, you pay cash or with your bank card. Online, you pay with Lastschrift (not feasible for you, because reversible), well-known payment providers (Paypal, Sofort\xc3\xbcberweisung, GiroPay), Cash-on-delivery, by paying an invoice once you get the goods (large shops aiming at older people) or Vorkasse (rare, small shops, people will avoid this).\n\nThe creditguard page (if people look at the URL, they might be put off, but who does...) contains UTF-8 barf instead of Umlaut characters, and spelling errors (lowercase "Kasse" on the button, "Ka**a**rten", "Der einfach Weg" (should be "einfache"), ...)\n\nObviously, all of these are incredibly risky. Sofort\xc3\xbcberweisung may sound safe, but once people start paying with hacked bank accounts, it will not be. Also, Sofort\xc3\xbcberweisung is basically doing the same thing that phishers do - you give them your account data, they log into your bank account, spy on your transactions, then send the transaction, posing as you towards the bank. This makes it slightly unpopular with a) banks b) people who know how it works and care about security. **Giropay might work**, since it is actually run by the banks, so you might have a guarantee and they might eat the fraud losses (until they decide they no longer want to do business with you). The others are obviously infeasible for you, except Vorkasse, which would turn you into a normal exchange, basically.\n\nhttps://anycoindirect.eu/de/kaufen/dogecoins seems to be a competitor (which I randomly found when searching for guarantees for merchants when using giropay), and they suffer from similar issues (e.g. horrible German). However, they have very low fees. (They are also very new. I expect that they have underestimated the complexity of the issue and will crash and burn in some horrible way, likely involving Sofort demanding fradulent payments back.)\n\nIn general, anything that allows hackers to anonymously withdraw money from hacked accounts might be very popular with the wrong kind of customer.

Consumer accounts are still tallied in their respective local currency. When I want to pay a bill, or send a friend money, the actual transfer of value is done by moving bankcoins through a blockchain. Individual users support the network, doing so they are credited for all fees that would be normally be charged to transfer that value. For example, each month the bank charges you $20 in your local currency for a package. If you run the app all month you get a $20 credit netting you $0. If you send a friend money and that normally costs $5, by running the app you are credited for this charge as well. Users would see all these credits on their statement, people talk and before long everyone would be running it.\n\nFrom a consumer facing perspective, all this is going on behind the scenes without the user being aware of how the value is shuffling around. That is what I mean by abstracting the technology away from the user. Users never have to see or even know the bankcoin exists. It's only being used in the background to transfer value between accounts. This gives all the benefits of bitcoin today except storing your own wealth. Some users would like to do this, a lot of users do not want to be responsible for this, myself being one of them.\n\nI'm a CTO so I'm no stranger to technology.

It instead achieves distributed consensus, *at the cost of efficiency*. \n\n\nIn other words, if you\'re a central authority (in your example, the bank), using a blockchain makes **no sense whatsoever** when a central database achieves the same job and is much less expensive to maintain, support, store, etc.\n\n\nOnce again, to reiterate (because it is very important that you understand this point, so you realize why what you\'re saying doesn\'t make sense): **a centralized blockchain does not make any sense; it confers no advantages nor benefits and actually would bring numerous disadvantages and unnecessary costs to deploy and preserve**.\n\n\nIf you have any questions about this, feel free to ask.': 2, 'Exactly.': 3, "Did you read my post?

You seem to be under the impression that what "the blockchain" achieves is an efficient database system.\n\nIt does. It may not today, extrapolate bitcoin for the next 5y and take a guess at what it\'s hashing power will be. Any distributed system with many nodes will provide better performance than a centralized one, even if there is a central authority controlling the distributed system. Lot\'s of aspects of computing share this trend: parallel programming (more lower clock cores > fewer higher clock cores), P2P (many slow nodes) vs. direct download (few high capacity nodes), BotNet\'s, etc.\n\n> What a blockchain achieves is not an efficient database backend. It instead achieves distributed consensus, at the cost of efficiency. \n\nThat is simply untrue. P2P is a good analogy. Imagine there\'s a single torrent site feeding all links, they would be a central authority on how to download files. Once you have the details, you connect to hundreds/thousands of distributed clients to stream chunks of data. P2P with few seeds is inefficient, P2P with hundreds of seeds is very efficient. The bitcoin network is the same, it\'s power is it\'s size not who controls it.\n\n> In other words, if you\'re a central authority (in your example, the bank), using a blockchain makes no sense whatsoever when a central database achieves the same job and is much less expensive to maintain, support, store, etc.\n\nThe cost to maintain all the colo\'s supporting transactions is huge. If a bank was able to push transaction processing to the community they would save a fortune on salaries for employees, hosting fees, etc. In the beginning they\'d have to run both which would cost more, but over time they would remove colo costs and could offset the loss in fees by the savings in hosting.\n\n> Once again, to reiterate (because it is very important that you understand this point, so you realize why what you\'re saying doesn\'t make sense): a centralized blockchain does not make any sense; it confers no advantages nor benefits and actually would bring numerous disadvantages and unnecessary costs to deploy and preserve.\n\nWhat costs? To write an app and give it to customers? Going back to my no fees incentive, the cost of that solution pales in comparison to the ongoing costs any payment processor is using today. All the CC companies outsource processing, they can\'t handle the volume on their own and pay companies a small fortune to securely process transactions for them.\n\nForget about bitcoin (the currency) for a moment and only focus on the blockchain. Take that technology and see what else you can apply it to. If you keep an open mind you\'ll be surprised at what you can come up with.

The sum of active BTC swaps began to rise sharply on 25th October suggesting that traders are betting that the bitcoin price will fall further.\n\nA BTC swap takes place when traders borrow bitcoin at one price to trade it for US dollars, hoping the price will fall by the time they purchase bitcoin again to return it to the lender. Total BTC swaps on Bitfinex nearly doubled from 8,799 BTC on 25th October to 16,281 BTC the next day.\n\nExamining the swap data in greater detail also suggests that shorts profited from the mid-week price drop. Bitcoin swaps spiked as the price tumbled on the morning of 23rd October, potentially driving the price down.\n\nAs the week ended, total active swaps stood at over 18,000 BTC, the highest level since April 2013, according to Bitfinex data. Swap volume also depends on the amount of customers using a particular exchange, of course, and Bitfinex's trading volume and user base has only become significant since last October, according to Bitcoinity volume data.\n": 1, '"defeated, or at least repelled", and *huge profit* is both an assumption and a relative term\n\n': 0, 'Sounds cool, but you assume that there are not people holding and/or providing services and products with the intent of hording bitcoins.

If timed perfectly, a buy at the bottom of a long downtrend can be rewarding - both financially and emotionally - but the risks run extremely high. This term implies that the investment will never be a good one again.

"Money transmitters" are a form of "money service business".  To regulators in the US, the are somewhere between a normal business and a bank.  Authorities are always concerned that money transmitters could become a high volume payment rail for groups that are doing things which are illegal.  Being authorities, their job is to enforce the law, and regulators actually create regulations that are "interpretations" of the law, which gives them quite a bit of latitude in terms of their decision making ability and general power.  \n\nMy service publishes a brief, easy to read overview of these [strict requirements that bitcoin direct sale and purchase businesses must follow.  Just click this or the previous sentence.](https://novauri.com/regulation-and-compliance/)\n\n**What is really going on with Circle?  Just one man\'s completely uninformed opinion** \n\nTwo things:\n\n1) they didn\'t know what they were getting into by going into financial services; and\n\n2) the are in reaction mode.\n\n1+2 is clearly evident in the fact that they accepted credit cards, but didn\'t have the experience to check their MCC codes with MasterCard and Visa.  They ended up with a pseudo-cash MCC code (like a cash advance) because the networks decided they were selling a cash advance like product.  When you buy stuff on credit, and the network gives your product an MCC code in the pseudo-cash range (there are 4-5 types if I recall), it\'s not like buying a pack of gum.  Typically your bank will charge you a cash advance fee.  What\'s worse, you IMMEDIATELY begin accruing interest (not the next billing cycle) at a much higher rate than your normal purchases.  This is nearly ubiquitous with credit cards, because anyone withdrawing cash from a credit card is a higher credit risk, because, well, they are obviously strapped.\n\nWell Circle either had no idea this was going to happen, or did the world\'s worst job notifying their customers.  They ended up having to reimburse their customers for the fees and costs.  I know that sounds complicated, but to someone who has worked in the business, that was a rookie mistake.  My point?  They don\'t have experienced upper/middle level leaders in that company from the FI industry.  Senior execs?  Sure, but they are stuffed shirts and don\'t remember what an MCC code is.  I\'ll probably be one of those guys in 10-15 years, so it\'s not a dig, just a guess.\n\nNow... since they made that rookie mistake on cards, I bet they are fumbling through the regulation thing too.  They probably have very good, highly paid attorneys, but don\'t have anyone on staff who has the experience to know what to do quickly. \n\nThey are also probably fumbling through fraud.  Taking credit cards for bitcoin is a lose/lose proposition for any business.  It\'s too easy to buy the information needed to make a credit card charge pass with a CIP verified account, and the reversal process favors the consumer, and the networks will pull your merchant account if you don\'t honor their ruling.  \n\nPeople really don\'t understand how complicated and incredibly challenging fraud mitigation really is.
