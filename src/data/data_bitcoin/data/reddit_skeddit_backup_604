Unfortunately there is no restriction on the issuance of credit and the only thing that stops them issuing more is when the people start rioting and refuse to accept their funny money. When governments and banks can't pay back the debt, they simply create more debt to pay off the old debt, much like how someone signs up for a new credit card to pay off the old one that is about to come due, each time they create more debt (via interest) which is even harder to pay off than the debt before it, eventually getting to the point where they can never pay it off and the only option is to let the debt default, which causes havoc in the economy, or simply try to push the problem down the road in the hope they will never have to deal with it and at the same time making the problems even bigger.

At any given moment, the market has no reason to hoard since, except for earning the discount rate, a holder has no reasonable expectation, on average, of additional appreciation. In fact, fearing an economic turndown, a buble bursting, or...whatever, many holders may conclude that the purchasing power of bitcoin is likely to decline--that is, that current market expectations about continued increases in purchasing powers that are discounted into the price today are wrong--and therefore look to spend now while the spending is good.

It won\'t be deflationary for many years to come. Second, moderate deflation isn\'t any different from moderate inflation. People routinely focus on the downsides of deflation by saying it discourages people from buying, but that is only looking at a small part of the picture. There is no "best solution" in the deflation vs inflation debate, there are simply trade-offs (like nearly all complex problems). \n\nInflation encourages buying, and simultaneously *discourages* selling. Why sell now when I can wait and get more money?\n\nDeflation encourages selling, and simultaneously *discourages* buying. Why buy now when I can wait and pay less money?\n\nNeither of these are problematic so long as the inflation/deflation is *moderate*. Extreme inflation is just as bad as extreme deflation. However, historically extreme inflation is [far more common](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperinflation#Hyperinflationary_episodes) than extreme deflation.\n\nThere are also other problems that arise with supply inflation, like how do you distribute the newly created money into the system? If all the newly created money were equally distributed among the population, then inflation wouldn\'t be a problem. The problem arises when central banks use their power to print money to indirectly extract wealth from the poor and give it to the rich. The US government has been printing tens of billions of dollars a month for many years as part of QE. Who got all that money? It wasn\'t you and me. Fortunately none of that money has circulated through the economy yet, but it will some day.\n': 19, 'Concerns over hoarding are a canard. Any economics student will tell you that the value of a good or currency TODAY is equal to the discounted future expectations of value in the future.  This is why the Fed, in order to "create" inflation, must make QE announcements that, either as to timing or in amount, "shock" the market.  Shock and surprise is required because today\'s price ALREADY includes the market\'s expectations about what the Fed will do in the future.  \n\nWith Bitcoin, there can be no such "shocks" or surprises. The amount of bitcoins at any given point in the future is known with near certainty and cannot be changed by any centralized authority.  Thus, any market expectations about future value increases due to "deflation" are ALREADY built into TODAY\'S price. "Hoarding" thus does not good.  \n\nThis is not to say that you can\'t make money hoarding bitcoins, since the market sometimes gets get things wrong--that is, market expectation prove to be too optimistic or pessimistic.  My point is only that "programmed" and scheduled deflation or disinflation can never incentivize hoarding, just a like programmed and scheduled inflation can never incentivize spending. That\'s just economics 101. ': 2, 'you could say everything has a fiat value as opposed to an inherent value. We run into the problem of equivocation where we ascribe titles to  the relationships we have with goods based on our CURRENT or IDEAL circumstances.

': 1, "Exactly. This is such a huge point that can't be emphasized enough. Deflation is inherently dangerous to debt based money because it increases the real value of debt making it more difficult to repay loans. Since the majority of money in the fiat system is bank credit that is created through bank lending, the whole system depends on constant inflation. \n\nIn a system where money isn't created through lending, however, deflation merely indicates that the economy is shifting its emphasis toward saving rather than spending and is prioritizing those sectors that focus on long term investment and away from those sectors that focus on immediate consumption. Because our current fiat money can't survive within a deflationary environment, the economy never really focuses on the long term and instead becomes addicted to the short term and consumption, and while that may be good in doses, it can't create a sustainable and healthy economy in the long run. Eventually always thinking in terms of short term profits causes the economy to burn out and the only thing that keeps it going is artificial bubbles created by central bank monetary policies. It is a bit like desperately throwing paper on a campfire to keep it going after the wood has already burnt away. Inflation and deflation are natural cycles that balance each other, but because our current form of money doesn't allow for one half of the balance, the system eventually becomes imbalanced and that is what we are seeing now. \n\nDeflation isn't inherently bad anymore than being sober is inherently bad. Being sober is bad if you are a drug addict, because it means you will have to go through devastating withdrawal. Deflation is bad for fiat money because it means the whole system will have to go through withdrawal.

All i was saying is that you were completely wrong. ': 1, 'Inflation does NOT "encourage" buying and deflation does NOT "encourage" savings.  Rather UNEXPECTED inflation encourages buying and UNEXPECTED deflation encourages savings.  \n\nThis is because markets discount all known future events to the present. Thus, if we know that inflation will occur in the future, that gets discounted to the present and the inflation happens instantly today.  If the Fed announced today that it will print $5 trillion in 2017, and the market believed it, the inflation wouldn\'t occur in 2017, but NOW.  The price would adjust instantly. \n\nThis is why the Fed is so careful to manage market expectations and to announce QE at times that the market either does not expect or in amounts larger than expected.  "Shocking" or surprising the market is the only way to "create" inflation today. Known or expected future expectations of inflation are already reflected in today\'s dollar price.  \n\nWith Bitcoin, there is no way to shock or surprise the system.  Bitcoins are created on a predetermined and hard wired schedule.  This knowledge, including knowledge that such creation will cease at a specified time, is therefore already built into TODAY\'S price.  There is, therefore, nothing to be gained from hoarding.  Said another way, when the rate of disinflation or deflation is known in advance, as is the case with Bitcoin, there is no "incentive" to hoard or spend.  In these cases, there is no such thing as a "deflationary" currency. \n\nThat\'s not to say that you can\'t make money hoarding bitcoins, since sometimes the market gets things wrong.  For instance, in addition to the known disinflationary schedule, the market is pricing into today\'s price certain expectations about Bitcoin\'s use and adoption.  If actual use/adoption/demand exceeds current expectations, or the market comes to believe that it will in the future, then the market price will move higher NOW. Thus, by hoarding, one isn\'t hoping to make money from Bitcoin\'s "deflationary" nature but rather from betting that the market is currently underestimating Bitcoin\'s growth in adoption/usage/demand.   \n\nEdit:  Fixed typos\n\n': 2, '>big-picture right about Bitcoin from day 1\n\nYou predicted it would go from fractions-of-a-penny to hundreds-of-dollars in value?\n\nLink me!

In an economy where the only way to add more money is through debt, you are essentially creating a scenario where the economy must remain slightly inflationary in order to keep the economy running otherwise the debts can't be repaid, new loans can't be made and etc., Bitcoin however doesn't create new money via debt, once the money is created it exists in perpetuity until it is lost. If it is lost it's scarcity rises and it's value is essentially redistributed among the other Bitcoins that are still being controlled or circulated. If there is higher demand for Bitcoins it will increase the value of Bitcoins that people already posses and give people an incentive to spend, thus moving around more Bitcoins to meet the increased demand. \n\nWe've already seen that happened when the price hit 1000 (people had lots of extra risk free money to play with (aka disposable income) and merchants were more than happy to accept the transactions as they could easily/quickly use intermediaries to shield them from the risk. The price also shot up as quickly as it did because there was no means of increasing generation of Bitcoin to satisfy the short term demand.

I sell a promise to pay "1 bushel of wheat" worth of USD in 30 days to him for $230 (current price for a bushel of wheat). Later if the price drops to $200, instead of using my $200 to buy a bushel of wheat and give it to him to repay my debt, I just give him the $200 which is far more convenient for the both of us. None of us need to actually hold the wheat. However, if the price goes up, then I need to pay more than the $230 I received. In order to provide more confidence that I can actually fulfill my promise, I am forced to put up some of my own money as the margin along with the $230 received as a collateral to back the value of the contract. Also if the price of wheat goes up too high that my collateral is in danger of not backing the obligation, I will be margin called (forced into paying off my debt with the collateral sooner than the 30 days).\n\nBitShares basically takes this concept, makes it fungible (all the longs are fungible and not tied to any particular short position), replaces the wheat with anything that has a well defined price relative to BTS (USD, EUR, CNY, Gold, Silver, BTC, Oil, etc.) and replaces the $ with BTS so that the blockchain can actually have control over the collateral.

The operator is forbidden to use another wallet or try to anonymize the transactions. Any user should be able to audit the exchange at any time using the BlockExplorer, please check the exchange\xe2\x80\x99s info for the wallet address.\n\nThe operator is STRICTLY forbidden to operate/trade against its customers.

If the operators fails to comply with this rules, BlinkTrade can cut the operators access to the server and suspend the operations, not before returning the customers money and bitcoins.\n\nBlinktrade only provides the technology and makes sure the operators are following a specific set of rules.
