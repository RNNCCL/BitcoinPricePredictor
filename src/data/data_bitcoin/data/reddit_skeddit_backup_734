I did not know about the concept of backwardation, and I also didn't know it was happening in the gold market right now.\n\n/u/changetip 1000 bits": 6, 'I actually thought that overall it was a pretty good report.  The guy (unlike most people) does understand that *all* money is a type of "bubble" (including fiat); my main disagreement with him is over which bubble is more likely to last.  He thinks that since government fiat currencies are generally used as units of accounts in the economies of the world, that prices are sticky and thus less likely to collapse to zero than the more free floating prices of far less sticky assets like gold and bitcoin.  Historically speaking, however, his point is rather absurd.  Sticky prices are not stuck prices, it\'s just some friction in the float.  The main factor in monetary collapse has always been confidence loss in the integrity of the currency due to debasement.  That\'s something gold (and bitcoin, though he doesn\'t seem to think so since "anything that\'s programmed can be reprogrammed", which while literally true, is not a good critique of bitcoin\'s monetary integrity) is immune from.  That\'s why the gold "bubble" has lasted 6000 years.  Ironically he seems to be somewhat aware of this as he thinks it may last another 6000, but what doesn\'t really make sense in his analysis is his rather blind faith in the integrity of fiat, even though he describes its weaknesses and failure modes (modes that have occurred over and over throughout history).  He kind of just handwaves that all away when it comes to conclusion time, along with a lot of fuzzy language ("Nobody understands the mysteries of the unit of account or num\xc3\xa9raire") that more or less can be summarized as "I\'m just giving government fiat the benefit of the doubt".  Strange.\n\nAside from some strange conclusions however, at least this guy has a decent understanding of the nature of monetary systems, which is more than can be said for most.': 7, 'Classic banking circlejerk. /r/bitcoin, we have competition.

": 3, "I think it's a very good time to buy physical gold and avoid derivatives. It's also a good time to not put much stock into gold spot prices. They might continue down but that doesn't mean anyone trying to buy size can reliably buy large amounts of physical at the spot price.  What good is a low dollar price for an asset that can't actually be bought for dollars? What does it matter if that price goes lower? Small buyers shouldn't have problems buying or selling coins near spot price unless things get really bad.  \n\nTo be clear this is the most recent development of a longer term thing.  We've been in a near critical state since 2008.  I'm not saying something happens immediately, it might just recover, but the warning flashers are on.": 5, 'Flashback 2008: Citigroup gets massive government bailout \nhttp://www.reuters.com/article/2008/11/24/us-citigroup-idUSTRE4AJ45G20081124': 6, 'Now THAT is hilarious. When a central bank trashes gold, and then compares that trash to an "equivalent" trash known as Bitcoin, you know that they are scared about their House of Cards collapsing, and are scared about the people waking up to the truth about gold & Bitcoin. We are definitely on the right path here with Bitcoin.': 10, 'Big things are happening in gold right now so they are bringing out all the talking heads they can to trash gold. \n\nIf you were unaware, gold is in backwardation and getting deeper backwardated every day. If you thought spot price was the way to judge gold, think again. Gold spot price is not a measure of the price of gold, it\'s a measure of the price of gold derivatives which at rare times cannot actually value real physical gold.  Backwardation is another indication to watch and means stress in the system of gold derivatives vs real gold.  Backwardation is a very rare thing for gold and means large holders of physical gold are currently unwilling to swap out their gold at a "risk free" profit for gold derivatives... they are worried the futures system can\'t currently be trusted to get their physical gold back to them. Periods of backwardation are historically very short and during some significant  crisis (e.g. Lehman Brother\'s collapse). That we are now in the longest period of backwardation on record (and it just keeps getting more backwardated)  is ominous. \n\n\nYou might think of backwardation as an event similar to everyone pulling bitcoin out of centralized exchanges and holding them in paper wallets themselves, to the point where people won\'t even take a deposit bonus to deposit bitcoins.  And consider that centralized exchanges are where we get bitcoin price, so what does price even mean when people pull bitcoin from the place where price is set?  Such a thing would only happen when trust in the centralized systems is failing.  It\'s the same for both for bitcoin and gold, but in the case of gold you\'re talking about the defacto basis of the entire world monetary system--this is no small issue.\n\n**This is literally the most important financial issue happening right now IMO and almost nobody knows it\'s happening or what it is**. It\'s related to the possible collapse of the fiat system (which will be preceeded by gold going into permanent backwardation; gold spot price will be irrelevant).\n\n[Read more on this issue here](https://goldmarketmacro.wordpress.com/article-archive-2/permanent-gold-backwardation/)\n\nYou can see a long term chart of this using gold forwards at this link. Backwardation is basically when the line drops below zero. Notice we\'ve been in a near crisis state since the 2008 mess (and going in and out of backwardation since late 2013) and in the last few weeks have started a plunge consistently below zero and to lows not seen in over a decade. And we\'re still dropping.

Adoption is also not just no then yes. Once yes that adopter may continue saving, contributing more 'adoption'.": 1, 'The price of bitcoin doesn\'t matter.\n\nUsing the currency simply as a vehicle to move value simply involves the buying of however much bitcoin is needed to represent that value.

Yes, as adoption increases so will the price, but if you look at curves of adoption you can see it can only ever completely expand to fill a given economy, and thereby will eventually top out in price (of course, loss of bitcoins and other externalities will push this slightly higher over time). \n\nWhat you have then is not that "bitcoin is too expensive" for people, but that "early adopters are freaking rich." It still remains possibly the most effective store of value mankind has ever devised.\n\n(Side note, how can we justify that a small number of people become ludicrously wealthy via hodling (sp) this asset? Sounds like a ponzi scheme, right? Wrong. While a ponzi scheme redistributes wealth without any benefit to most of the people who are participating, the increasing adoption of bitcoin is an amazing addition of utility to anyone that uses it. Early adopters are thus rewarded by being the first to support and legitimize this new system)\n\nIn terms of fees, who cares? The majority of transactions (person to person and person to institution) will definitely take place outside of the blockchain, simply because it\'s very cost effective to use centralized systems to do that. The blockchain will likely be used for clearing transactions between large parties like institutions or governments, since it\'s such a beautiful system.\n\nIndividuals can still run a full node, and this is very useful for making sure that large entities are completely transparent. Transaction fees will likely disappear, honestly, since these institutions will most likely end up doing most of the mining, and simply absorb the cost of running the hardware.

In a deflation, they say, people will hoard currency and won\'t spend, so producers won\'t be able to sell and will go bankrupt. Our current society runs mostly on credit - and during a deflation those who take credit are at a disadvantage, because they would have to repay in appreciated currency.\n\nOthers (Austrians) say that this is nonsense. For instance, one of the most productive (per capita) periods in US history experienced mild deflation. The prices of electronics are constantly dropping - and their producers haven\'t been driven bankrupt. The "hoarding" argument ignores the concept of time preference - consumption now is always more highly valued than consumption later; if it wasn\'t like this, we would all starve while hoarding/investing all our capital. Also, a producer makes money from the spread between the cost of production and the sale price - as long as this spread is stable (i.e., the cost of raw materials falls just as fast as the cost of the finished product), they will thrive no matter which way the prices go.': 6, "I guess adoption would be a curve symmetrical to the monetary base curve with respect to the central axis?\n\nI don't get your point though.": 1}, ('Bitcoinsupermaket.eu is online - the first Bitcoin only supermarket in Europe is finally there', 95): {'Good initiative, \n\nAs BTC is not a unit of measure for the price for now, it would be nice to also show EUR price conversion': 4, "I'm lifting when I'm reading reddit or watching the ratings at bitcoinwisdom.com.

People get caught up over whether gold is a "productive asset" or not, but that seems to be based on the assumption that an asset needs to be directly "productive" in order to produce a real return.  It doesn\'t - a deflationary monetary store of value (which is how gold acts in our monetary system) can produce a consistent real return in the long run so long as the economy is growing.  This is the same situation as government debt, aka sovereign bonds.  They both derive their real returns from the same basic mechanism - economic growth.  The only difference is that government debt has a positive nominal return in an inflationary unit of account ($\'s or other fiat), whereas gold has zero nominal returns in a deflationary unit of account (oz of gold).  In real terms however, they are quite similar, and real is what ultimately matters.\n\nThere\'s no reason to think that gold will stop producing a real return so long as: 1. it continues to be viewed as a deflationary store of value, and 2. the global economy continues to grow.  Most people don\'t argue against the second point, and if you do, then you have to admit we have bigger problems than gold.  You can argue against the first, but you\'re getting into speculation over future socio-economic and cultural phenomena - nothing is for certain there.  I will point out however that trying to argue that it won\'t be viewed as a deflationary store of value *because* it doesn\'t produce a real return is a circular argument in nature, and one that\'s at odds with prior reality.\n\nAll of this just highlights how important confidence is to any monetary system.

From my reading, it seems a password can be set on top? So, of course, being able to place this extra hurdle on an attacker is extremely beneficial. I would be definitely willing to add a secure password to protect that seed.\n\nFrom the standpoint of why it may be a good feature, even for the masses, it may help introduce an additional point of failure into the process. If the newb secures the seed poorly, but chooses a secure password, then that password may end up being a savior. If the newb secures the seed reasonably well, but chooses a poor password, then the password still has value in preventing mistakes (with management of the seed) from affecting security. And finally, if the seed is secured poorly, and the password is also poor, at least the poor password can present an obstacle to a hacker, hopefully long enough that the user can retrieve funds and transfer them out.\n\nEither way, what is being asked of users, in such a case? The PIN number, the 12-word seed, and a \'great\' password to secure the seed. It does not seem like asking too much, especially since the PIN is entered regularly and the 12-word seed is recorded somewhere (thus not burdening memory). The only thing being asked to remember in this case is the password alone... and that too can be recorded along with the seed, somewhere (though recorded mentally, ideally, so it can never be hacked).\n\nIf the above doesn\'t seem reasonable, and the issue of newbs forgetting passwords is the big issue, then I fall back on what I initially said: "please at least consider making a secure implementation of this feature, at least as an *optional* security feature".\n\nRATIONALE: I would definitely 100% feel more comfortable having a 2nd layer of protection... for example via a secure password memorized in my head (and thus un-hackable), which is protecting the seed from potentially being uncovered physically or digitally (depending on storage location), uncovered either by user error or a clever attacker. If we\'re not considering the attacker to be a professional (90% the case if storing seed on paper or locally), then even a poor password would block an uncovered seed from being stolen.\n\nHaving 2-of-3 on top of a password would only be better, in my opinion.\n\nAlthough, I do have fears that asking a user to secure 3 keys in 3 different locations (and not forget them, and maintain access forever to them) may be asking an incredible lot? No? I can imagine the typical person simply storing all 3 keys in the same place, ruining the purpose of it. It may be simpler to ask the user just to store securely the single seed, and to also remember a secure password to protect that seed.\n\nAnd you said this: "key stretching in the standard is very weak so that it can be performed by low power devices" -- Can the standard you\'re referring to, be made more secure?': 1, 'Thanks misterigl, I think I get it - will give that a try :)': 1, "Probably, haven't tried it yet, though.

The shop keeper has the right to demand Federal Reserve notes as payment. Printed on all US dollars, it says "This note is legal tender for all debts public and private."
