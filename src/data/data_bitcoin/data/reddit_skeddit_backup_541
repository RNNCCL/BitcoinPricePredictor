I agree that violating the 21M cap is politically impossible for the forseeable future, but I do not think that it is unfair to long-term savers. I\'ll grant that long term savers do not require a lot of new mining to protect their precious bitcoins from malicious mining attacks, because they are buried under so much proof of work. However, long-term savers absolutely need confidence in the network to be maintained, because this confidence is critical to maintain the value/price of the long-term stored bitcoin. That confidence depends on the ongoing mining effort, and long term savers can be justifiably asked to pay for that ongoing effort. In fact, they will be getting an unfair free ride on the backs of transaction-fee payers at some point in the future when the inflation rate gets low enough.\n\nSo the argument that inflation is unfair is not valid. It is quite the opposite. Lack of inflation is unfair.\n\nThe better argument to be making is that people might just opt out of paying the inflation charge by using a different currency that free-rides on the blockchain. Whether they would do that is hard to know, since bitcoins may be able to demand a small premium via inflation if they can offer better network effect and/or long term appreciation. Or if people just felt better about themselves by using bitcoin and not "cheating".\n\nAnother mechanism you could consider is a two-currency system like Seigniorage Shares or Bitshares/BitUSD in which perhaps you could charge a fee for the valuable service of providing a stable store of value -- and perhaps that fee could be passed onto the miners to aid with security.\n\nMaybe -- and this is really a half baked idea -- but maybe the blockchain could actually *loan* money to people somehow, and could charge interest on the loan.': 1, "Thanks for the feedback! It's a great opportunity to hone these ideas.\n\nI think the relationship between long-term saving and short-term transacting is symbiotic. Everyone will do both with Bitcoin, just like everyone does both with fiat currently. I think a healthy chain has people doing both, and without both any chain will fail.\n\nI think you're exactly right in noting that (as I think I alluded) an inflation-funded Bitcoin would be vulnerable to market failure when sidechains come on board. If there were two chains available, one with high inflation + low tx fees, the other no inflation + high tx fees, people would hold their savings in the latter and move balances into the former for their transactions, leaving the inflationary chain underfunded and leading to market failure.\n\nAnyway, one of the major points that I'm heading towards is that we need to be able to experiment with these ideas using sidechains. Otherwise it's just educated guessing and there's no way of predicting or determining 100% what is possible, how things could be implemented, how popular they will be, how they will actually work out.": 1, 'I guess I could have read the conclusion.': 2, "Yup, that's why the next post will be about how the fee can be determined. Stay tuned :)": 1, '>when sidechains come on board\n\nI don\'t think it\'s sidechains you would want to worry about, as these are pegged to the price of bitcoin. If bitcoin were inflating it would inflate the sidechain too. I\'d be more worried about counterparty tokens, or some "stealth" token, the movements of which cannot be detected by looking at the blockchain unless you have extra information.\n\nPersonally I suspect Bitcoin could afford a low inflation rate -- something less than 1% -- without seeing people defect, and I hate that any technical decisions that could be helpful are off-the-table for ideological/political/emotional reasons. Bitcoin is expected to deflate due to lost/burnt coins so a little inflation might not even alter the real value of the coins you hold.\n\nSmall transaction fees should always be viable, simply because it is impossible to build a decentralized system without a spam penalty.\n\nOther stabilizing forces that could potentially come into play are proof of stake + reputation hybrids (see Vitalik\'s POS with weak subjectivity, or Delegated Proof of Stake) or even legislation or taxpayer funded state mining operations if crypto really becomes they way earthlings conduct their affairs.\n\n>Otherwise it\'s just educated guessing and there\'s no way of predicting ... how they will actually work out.\n\nAin\'t that the truth': 1}, ('Outrageous Tipping Fees Will Eventually Force Google to Adopt Bitcoin', 65): {'Presumably google can just sell "GooglePoints" which you purchase once for low fees and then distribute how you will.

That is way out of date. The Rockefeller Foundation\'s positions could have completely changed since then. There have been a lot of terrible things that have been done by various groups in the past that have since been stopped or corrected. The are also plenty of issues to spend energy on that are relevant right now without fighting half-century old documents.\n\n* "In the course of August and September 2010, I wrote several articles for Infowars..." Infowars is known for unsubstantiated conspiracy theories. That alone doesn\'t rule out the truth of what\'s being claimed, but it isn\'t a vote of confidence either.\n\n* Nothing I saw in my first glance (including a search for "vaccine") through the original sources said anything about vaccine tainting.\n\n* The Rockefeller Foundation is not the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. If the Rockefeller Foundation is tainting vaccines that would be significant but it wouldn\'t mean that Gates is in on it.\n\nMy beliefs coming into this (may or may not be correct, take with a grain of salt):\n\n* Vaccines save lives. Unsubstantiated claims about vaccines being tainted erodes confidence in vaccines, causing fewer people to get vaccinated, causing more people to die of disease. This is a serious issue that needs careful consideration.\n\n* The Earth cannot support an infinite human population. At some point we will will reach maximum capacity. Population growth will have to be addressed at some point before we reach that point. I don\'t know what that point is or how close we are to it.\n\n* Reducing population growth in under developed regions will help the economy of those regions. Regions that have a growing population don\'t do as well economically as regions with a stable population. That is because population growth means more babies being born, more old people staying alive longer, or both. That means a higher ratio of people that need looked after to the number of working age adults who are able to provide.\n\n* Untainted vaccines that are what they say on the box indirectly reduce the birth rate. Parents faced with high infant/child mortality have more children to compensate. Vaccines reduce the infant/child mortality, giving parents more confidence that their progeny will grow into healthy, grandchild producing adults. This is a significant factor in why developed countries have a lower birthrate than under developed countries. Tainting isn\'t needed for vaccines to reduce birth rates.\n\n* Bill Gates is a hero. He, along with Steve Jobs and the teams of people working for them, helped change the world by getting easy to use personal computers into households all over the developed world. Now he is using 99.9% of the reward to change the world again by helping the developing world catch up.\n\ntl;dr - I\'m skeptical of the claim that vaccines are intentionally tainted.

In essence both will probably happen and as the scarcity increases, more people will be drawn to Bitcoin and have greater incentive to spend as the coins rise in value (as it will increase people's disposable income) thus increasing transactions.

Bitcoin fails. That to me is the most unlikely scenario. Bitcoin has been through its baptism by fire, many times. Check out "bitcoin obituaries" its failed like 35 times now, and its still here. Bitcoin is the world\'s most resilient currency.\n\nIf you want an analogy I think of the banks as the dinosaurs. Massive beasts, you think nothing could ever bring them down. Bitcoin is the tiny rat-like sabre-toothed mammal that\'s scurrying about under their feet. Its the the little mammal that is the future, because the dinosaurs are too big to adapt.\n\n2. The cap is increased. Again this is tantamount to impossible. Yes the core code could be changed to allow for more than 21 million coins, but bitcoin is a consensus network so we would all have to AGREE to increase the cap, and deliberately DEVALUE the coins we already hold. Good luck with that.\n\n3. Bitcoin price goes through the roof. I actually think this is the most likely scenario. Lets say the market cap is a trillion dollars. Its still a trillion dollars whether we have 21 million bitcoins or 210 million bitcoins. It doesn\'t make any difference how many bitcoins there are the total value is the same. \n\nSo if the market cap was a trillion that makes 1 bitcoin about $50,000. So what? Why is an increase of $300 to $50,000 any more difficult to believe than an increase from a few cents to $300? The unit value of a bitcoin in no way impacts its use or how it works. Even if a bitcoin was worth a million dollars you could still use bitcoin to buy a coffee. Its digital so its completely fungible.\n\nMy guess is the more people have bitcoin, the more people will want it. People value that which is rare, and the  more users bitcoin has, the rarer it gets, and that bids up the price. I think $10,000 per coin is just the beginning.\n\nTake Facebook. Facebook is not the internet it is just one company that runs on the internet. Its worth about $150 billion dollars. What if I had said to you in 1995 that there will be single companies running on the internet that are worth over 100 billion? You would have laughed at me.\n10 years from now, I think there will be single companies running on the bitcoin network that can rival Facebook in size, which would put the total network market cap in the trillions.': 1, "Its not here to replace, it's here to compete.

We could see the stadium from the little table where we were sitting and many of the participating stores had "Bitcoin Bowl" stickers on their windows.

This was back in the days when Bitcoin was still in it\'s infancy and buying things, especially physical objects was very difficult.\n\nI was still trying to convince myself that Bitcoin was actually a useful way to buy things but it\'s hard to convince yourself when you\'ve never really used it, I was itching to use it to not only prove to myself that these bitcoin tokens were valuable, but also so that I could have a chance to spend some. I didn\'t want to buy digital things, I wanted to buy something that I could hold in my hand and say unequivocally that it is valuable and someone was willing to part with it for bitcoin.\n\nI settled on buying a [couple](http://bitcoinprbuzz.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/1-G-bitcoin-Silver-Series-A.png) of [these](http://bitcoinprbuzz.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/1-G-Bitcoin-Silver-Series-B.jpg) from a small, relatively unknown new webshop called http://bitcoincommodities.com/ which looks far more professional now.\n\nI\'d believed in Bitcoin previous to this, but had never had the pleasure of actually buying something tangible with it, I also didn\'t want to get scammed of my coins so I was still holding tight to them, but my desire to spend them was getting stronger than my fear of losing them so I took a chance and hoped I hadn\'t just given away my coins to a scam site. It was on receiving my coins that the penny finally dropped and the feeling that this was a real currency system with a real economy really started to sink in. Up to that point I wanted it to be real, but after my first purchase I knew it was real. \n\nThat, "this bitcoin thing is real and it\'s working" feeling was something I\'ll never forget and if I still had any doubts in my mind up until then, they were well and truly gone once I held those little coins in my hand. \n\nThis is why I often say that people should lead by example rather than simply talk people\'s ears off about Bitcoin. People respond to actions much better than words and its far harder to deny Bitcoin\'s utility when it happens right before their eyes.\n\nSo yeah, those little silver coins are still the coolest things I\'ve ever bought with Bitcoin.': 2, "The one thing I would previously use cash for: beer.\n\nEver since some of my local bars started accepting bitcoin I'm 99% cash-free.": 3, 'Would there be any reputable place one could buy said Volcano itself with BTC on the net??': 1, 'I am a fire spinner/performer.

You asked a rhetorical question in the attempt to sound superior and I plainly tell you that when people are taxed too much they stop paying and sometimes even start fighting and I tell you it has happened before. I urge you to look at america's history specifically when they revolted over the ability to make private money and a handful of small taxes. \n\n>Name one.\n\nYour ignorance of the financial markets is impeccable. All fiat currencies are interconnected. Hyperbitcoinization literally can't effect just one currency. It can have a larger impact on one than another at a specific time but it can't single out one specific currency. It effects them all. Take for example the recent increase in volatility, now in the currency markets its hard to go this is happening because X but what we can identify is contributing factors and then its up for debate on how much these factors influence the market because they influence everyone differently. Take for example the Euro, one of the strongest currencies in the world is falling rapidly. Cyprus and Greece have been having huge bank problems for over a decade and they have recently been in the international news again. Bank runs and hyperinflation are not side effects from bitcoin, they are side effects of a horrible system that finally has some competition outside its complete control. Bitcoin is the holy grail, its not some fancy gold plated cup with jewels but a simple brass cup made by a carpenter and its good enough to give the current system a run for the money. Now every shit country will probably switch to the rembi or the USD in the coming shitstorm when the smaller corrupt central banks go bust first, like venezuela. This leads to a temporary deflation in the dollar, that is what we are seeing now. If you think this ends with everyone using dollars for the rest of forever then I wish you goodluck, I do not share that view. As bitcoin gains momentum it will be able to execute speculative attacks against national currencies, once this happens once bitcoin wins as all the interconnected fiat currencies fail and people rush into the new currency and the bond market implodes as countries default as they have in the past.  \n\n\n": 0, 'Why would  "...an escrow for peace..."  be anymore likely due to the adoption of better currency?\n\n': 1, 'Here\'s the conundrum of what you are presupposing: Bitcoin\'s decentralized nature is prettymuch antithetical to the centralization upon which the success of nation States depends.

Why are the two able to coexist currently?\n2. How does what is fundamentally a publishing technology and a database technology equate to a mortal threat to any nation?  This statement is making what types of presuppositions?\n3. Why didn\'t previous database technologies and previous publishing technologies eliminate previous nation states?  At one time it was thought that the control of knowledge was what gave the nation state its power and today nation states clearly do not control all knowledge otherwise we wouldn\'t know who Edward Snowden is.  \n4. Why didn\'t previous assertions that "if nation states are unable to control the flow of information they will not survive" turn out to be false?\n5. There has been nation states which have continued to exist without control of fiat currency the most obvious of which is Zimbabwe.  Why doesn\'t Zimbabwe cease to exist?\n\nIt was once thought that the internet would undermine the power of nation states because since anyone could publish it would create a decentralized source of information about the world that nations could not control.  This turned out not to be true and indeed the internet has given governments like China and North Korea greater control over information than what people previously expected.\n\nThe internet is an "anyone can publish model".  Cryptocurrency is the same model except the data published does not reside on centralized servers.  Logically connect the dots between how removing centralized servers from the framework of publishing causes nation states anywhere in the world to collapse.\n\nI believe that when you answer these questions you will realize that publishing technologies and database technologies do not magically release people from living within national borders.  They don\'t erase cultural differences or historical based ideologies.  They don\'t prevent governments from collecting taxes.  They don\'t prevent governments from spending money on armies.\n\nThe internet is pretty powerful as a publishing technology, and a database technology.  EDIT: If we didn\'t have the (history of the) internet (as an example) and bitcoin came along in 1995 I might agree with you (in 1995 that this technology would end nation states) but since I have been able to see how nations have adapted and adopted (co-opted in China\'s case) internet technology the safer bet is to believe that nations can adapt and adopt to bitcoin as a new technology.\n\nI give nations a 96% chance of surviving in the same form we see them today even if the dollar was undermined by a cryptocurrency loosing its world reserve currency status by 2025.  This is because the survival of nation states doesn\'t fundamentally require fiat currency or the ability to control all knowledge.

The buyer of the CDS makes a series of payments (the CDS "fee" or "spread") to the seller and, in exchange, receives a payoff if the loan defaults. **It was invented by Blythe Masters from JP Morgan in 1994.**\n\n>By the end of 2007, the outstanding CDS amount was **$62.2 trillion**,^[3] falling to $26.3 trillion by mid-year 2010 ^[4] but reportedly $25.5 ^[5] trillion in early 2012. CDSs are not traded on an exchange and there is no required reporting of transactions to a government agency.^[6] During the 2007-2010 financial crisis the lack of transparency in this large market became a concern to regulators as it could pose a systemic risk.^[7][8][9][10]\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_default_swap\n\n**tl;dr:** Blythe invented the financial instrument that created the subprime-mortgage crisis.': 3, '**More analysis:**\nhttp://www.zerohedge.com/news/2015-03-10/bitcoin-default-swaps-blythe-masters-joins-bitcoin-startup\n\n---\n\n**Original article text:**\n\n> Blythe Masters, the former JPMorgan executive who helped pioneer credit derivatives in the 1990s, has re-emerged as chief executive of a cryptocurrency start-up.\n\n> Digital Asset Holdings aims to be a venue for buyers and sellers of financial assets to meet and transact, switching currencies into bitcoin in order to cut the cost and time of settlement and make use of the decentralised \xe2\x80\x9cblock chain\xe2\x80\x9d as a secure record of transactions.\n\n> Bitcoin was created in the wake of the financial crisis by an anonymous computer scientist keen to displace central banks, government currencies and the traditional banking system.\n\n> Its most ardent devotees include libertarians and drug dealers, but financial services companies are interested in exploiting the underlying technology, which allows the ownership of a bitcoin to be transferred from one user to another.\n\n> \xe2\x80\x9cThere is a school of libertarian \xe2\x80\x98visionaries\xe2\x80\x99 who want to imagine a world without big banks, big governments,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ms Masters, who left JPMorgan last April. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s nice, but completely irrelevant to this business model. We don\xe2\x80\x99t imagine a world in which big banks and big governments don\xe2\x80\x99t exist.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n> \xe2\x80\x9cThey say they want the world to change, but the world will change by adopting new technology to do a better job,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. Reducing the frictional costs of financial transactions is \xe2\x80\x9cone of the great challenges of our time\xe2\x80\x9d.\n\n> Ms Masters said she had held discussions with the Federal Reserve, the Bank of England and New York\xe2\x80\x99s Department of Financial Services about the venture, though it would not need regulators\xe2\x80\x99 blessing because it was not an exchange, a custodian or a money transmitter.\n\n> Instead, it will admit creditworthy members \xe2\x80\x94 such as big banks and asset managers \xe2\x80\x94 to trade between themselves using DAH\xe2\x80\x99s technology.\n\n> Ms Masters would not say how much she had invested, nor when the venture would launch. DAH was founded last year by Sunil Hirani, founder and chief executive of trueEX, an exchange for interest rate swaps, and Don Wilson, founder and CEO of DRW Trading, a proprietary-trading firm. The venture has employees in New York, Chicago and Tel Aviv, a cryptocurrency hub.\n\n> Ms Masters, 45, is best known for a diverse career at JPMorgan, where she was instrumental in the development of the credit default swaps market as a young banker. Latterly she was head of the global commodities business and left when the bank sold it last year for $3.5bn.\n\n> In a research note on Tuesday, Goldman Sachs analysts noted that \xe2\x80\x9cbitcoin and cryptocurrencies allow for the decentralised transfer of assets without a central clearing authority\xe2\x80\x9d. They predicted that the technology could wipe out 20 per cent of the revenue the money transfer industry makes from consumer-to-consumer currency transfers and allow companies to cut $74bn in overheads from businesses-to-business payments over time.\n\n> A handful of existing companies, including Ripple Labs, are attempting to achieve the same aim, though all have different technology.\n\n> \xe2\x80\x9cWe feel that some of the basic plumbing is missing in the system,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Wilson of DRW. \xe2\x80\x9cBridging the gap between bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies and traditional currencies is a problem. One settles immediately. One settles over a day or more than a day. Participants in this ecosystem will be able to control who they\xe2\x80\x99re transacting with because it\xe2\x80\x99s within a closed system where we can control who\xe2\x80\x99s in the pool.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n> Banks have an ambivalent attitude towards bitcoin \xe2\x80\x94 intrigued by the technology but concerned about its negative associations.\n\n> BBVA, the large Spanish bank, has invested in Coinbase, a bitcoin \xe2\x80\x9cwallet\xe2\x80\x9d. But other banks have stopped providing services to bitcoin companies, citing their riskiness.

One of the main innovations of bitcoin was paying the transaction processing nodes in new units of the currency.  AFAIK, there are no examples of a successful blockchain that doesn't do this. You'd need some other way to incentivize miners to process transactions honestly, and since cryptocurrency is the only form of money not controlled by a single entity, using it as the incentive is the only way to ensure that the blockchain is incorruptible. Any other incentive would quickly centralize control over the blockchain. One could argue that if Satoshi has a million coins, then he could pay miners to attack the blockchain for a long time; however, this strategy is prevented by game theory, given that he'd be destroying his own wealth in the process.

No matter what, you have to share profit for there to be a chance anybody accepts it. Actually, it can only succeed if +51% of miners do NOT have a long term interest in Bitcoin.

But you're relying entirely on that external incentives and motivations won't change. \n\nMixers can coinjoin themselves. Take transactions in, transfer everything to new address in one go, pay out from that address when requested in random chunks. Doublespend the mixer and you invalidate all recent transactions it made. There's other similar strategies that hide metadata and still block doublespends.\n\nWhen you do it gradually, the miners have to be powered off unless you want a high probability of only losing money on electricity until you've got 51% power. And you still have to compensate the miners for all of that time. And nothing may leak to others. Then when you have 51% you can put them on a private pool to create a doublespend chain.

Starting 10 blocks back, you'll have caught up after they've gotten to 45 blocks when you've finally got 55. Then you'll probably get block n+46 faster. \n\nThat's 7h 40 minutes catching up with 55% and a 10 blocks (from the starting point) doublespend.\n\nGood luck hiding.

Freedom to do the things that we want and more spare time on our hands to take part in the leisure pursuits that we enjoy. We live in the mechanisation of a modern world where its heart beats to the rhythm of jet planes that fly above and billions of cars that rev along all day. \n\nFor those of us who live in a 1st world country, we have had these luxuries for many decades and they seem trivial to us now. But these machines have given us great opportunities to travel for leisure or work and achieve more in less time. They have allowed us to become more connected and make the world a much smaller place. In centuries gone, the masses would have not wandered past their local area but today we can travel physically to any location in a couple of days or less. Transport has allowed for many opportunities in the world of trade and commerce and made us richer and more able. Able to be free! \n\nIt only seems logical then that the exchange of information would become modernised, which led to the Internet as we know it. Even faster than physical transport it has allowed us to share vast amounts of knowledge on a global scale. The instant exchange of information has allowed us to share our thoughts and ideas and create new worlds that exist digitally where the rules of the physical world do not apply. No longer is a printing press, TV crew, or radio station needed for means of sharing your thoughts or ideas with a global audience. Operating and communicating on a global scale is now remarkably cheap and easy.\n\nIt seems fitting that currencies should be the next in line to be modernised. In a world where we can physically travel anywhere in little amounts of time, or share information freely and cheaply. Why is it that we can not share wealth and value in such an easy fashion? As humans we value freedom and the chance it brings to create new businesses, help others, better ourselves. Humans are much like free flowing water. We travel and follow the path of least resistance until we hit a rock. This rock is then worn down little by little until we can flow again. \n\nBitcoin is much like free flowing water. It travels with little resistance, unaware of the political and physical borders of the real world it travels across. An apolitical payments network that does not judge or discriminate. Many instinctively recoil at Bitcoin and are saying something like this;\n\nWhat is this Bitcoin nonsense? How dare you tell me to use a currency that has no borders and will allow for a truly global exchange of value. A programable money that can be automated and will allow me to be my own bank and have more power and freedom is nonsense. Now leave me be so I can watch my government sanctioned TV that tells me there is only one currency and that is one that can only be used in a manner and region that my government sees fit.\n\nWhich seems more likely; that humans will stick to a local currency that can only be used in one small part of the world? or adopt to a global currency that is free to move much like we are? Not only is Bitcoin free to move around the world but it allows all to contribute and play fair. The incentive is far bigger to play by the rules than cheat. Compare this to todays monetary systems where the incentive is large enough for those who control the money supply to lie or steal and you can see why Bitcoin is the better system. \n\nA better system was born for the masses in centuries gone by that allowed for the flow and freedom of physical travel and has changed the way we live for the better. As we adopted to these freedoms of travel, we needed a superior system for the exchange of information. A better system called the \xe2\x80\x98Internet\xe2\x80\x99 was born and has allowed us to learn more and better ourselves beyond what our parents could have dreamed of just a few decades ago.\n\nWe now find ourselves in need of a better system for the transfer of value and wealth. That system could very well be Bitcoin. So too shall the exchange of value flow free like flowing water. Over a dumb network that does not judge. It shall bring the masses opportunities and freedoms that we can not imagine. The only losers are those at the top, the tough rock that thought it was impenetrable to the flowing water. It shall be smoothed down to size and made irrelevant by a free and open network that will bring fairness and transparency to all.': 1, 'That is true, I have learnt these values through technology and am slowly waking up to the fact that government means control.': 1, 'Thank you, I will give this a watch.': 1, "I'm encouraged by articles like this.
