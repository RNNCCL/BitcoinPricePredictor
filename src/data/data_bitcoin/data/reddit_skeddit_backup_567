Since the 10nanobtc outputs would cost the recipients more in marginal fees to spend than they were worth, so they were just bloating up the UTXO set (and a significant fraction of it is already these never-to-be-spent outputs :( ); it was further compounded by miners accepting very low fees 'to help the network'. :(\n\nSo, thus the dust limit. In effect it's just another fee, but its paid to the outputs, propping them up in value and making them closer to worthwhile to spend.\n\nOf course, it's just an IsStandard rule, it doesn't have to be at all consistent between nodes-- it's just a individual policy each node applies on its own.

I actually made a [comment recently](http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/2ws8va/bono_u2_would_make_an_awesome_ambassador_for/) touching on the benefits of Bitcoin in the developing world and within the field of developmental economics:\n\n>The people we\'re trying to target live on less than $1.25 a day. Horrible social, economic, and political conditions. Barely living hand to mouth.\n\n>They need our help to prosper, but telling them to convert their hard-earned savings into a highly volatile digital currency is not going to help. Had I provided a BTC-denominated microloan just two months ago, it would have lost 1/3 of it\'s real value.\n\n>That means the people who need the value of their money to stay constant the most, the poor who already live on the margins, will be subject to the wild (and recently, mostly negative) swings of the market.\nAnd before you say "but when the market does go up, they\'ll be millionaires!", that\'s like telling the poor to use their entire paycheck to buy lottery tickets in the hopes of striking it rich.\n\n>Bitcoin has a lot of great uses. I can definitely see Bitcoin be used in the remittance market, but to push it onto the poor as the solution to all their problems is naive to the true nature of Bitcoin.\nBitcoin has a lot of awesome uses, but at this time, store of real-world value is not one of them.\n\nAdditionally, a user in the aforementioned thread linked to a great discussion on the use of Bitcoin in developing countries:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/2dblpv/richard_boase_discusses_his_experience_promoting/\n\nI\'ll copy the tl\'dr here:\n\n\n* Richard Boase visited Kenya for 6 weeks\n\n* He believes that the Bitcoin community only focusses on third world adoption as a means of increasing the value of their holdings, and not because it solves a problem the 3rd world actually experiences. \n\n* He believes that while Bitcoin solves a problem in the first world, in the third world there\'s much more pressing issues such as basic infrastructure such as water, sewage, education, internet and electricity. Bitcoin is like learning to run before you can walk.  One of the schools he visited needed a clock, for example. Simple things we take for granted. \n\n* People in third world nations can\'t afford to lose half their net worth due to currency fluctuations, whereas here in the first world we generally can. \n\n* By and large Kenyans use the united states dollar when stability is needed. \n\n* Due to high import taxes, the \xc2\xa360 tablets he was handing out to the charities were sometimes worth 6 months wages to the people he was handing them to. He believes that it makes more sense to sell the tablet and buy things they need, like a clock. \n\n* Director of a charity in Kenya said Bitcoin opens up a world of possibility when it comes to fraud, since there\'s no accountability and no way to confirm that your bitcoins are actually going to the charity. \n\n* The author thinks we live in ivory towers, and that we don\'t realise the real problems that face people living in these third world countries. \n\n* The author went to the post office and asked how much it would cost to send \xc2\xa3100 to Kenya via traditional means and the price was \xc2\xa35. And \xc2\xa3500 would cost \xc2\xa317. Which is a lot cheaper than any bitcoin related service. \n\n* He was genuinely moved by the experience and thinks his previous Bitcoin evangelicalism was silly.

They argue that the steady decline in the value of currency spurs spending and in turn business growth, and on a macroeconomic level, overall economic growth. \n\nThe Friedman camp believes that inflation is detrimental to economic growth and that there should not be an opportunity cost behind simply saving money. The argument that if individuals and businesses are able to save their capital without the risk of marginal losses brought about by inflation, they would then be able to more efficiently and effectively allocate their money to grow their business/personal capital in a way they see fit, outside of the influence of a continually increasing monetary supply (and therefore decreasing monetary value). \n\nYou aren\'t willing to spend your Bitcoin today because you believe it will be worth more tomorrow. Which is the very argument Keynesians make as to why deflationary economies contract rather than grow. If we all put off purchases because we believe our money will buy twice as much tomorrow as it does today, businesses will have less productive output, leading to economic contraction and a rise in unemployment as no one is spending. As people spend less, businesses have to make less to keep up with demand, and as sales fall so does their need for employment. As unemployment rises, the number of individuals capable of purchasing (whereas previously it was a question of willingness) declines rapidly, further contributing to economic malaise. \n\nThat\'s the argument, at least.': 4, 'I honestly take the view that this report shows only good things about Bitcoin when taken into context. We currently sit at something like 2million users (over estimate I believe) in which case that is less than 1% of the national population of the United States.

The market is growing, and people are seeing the benefits of it.

As Gary North has observed in an essay, everybody involved appears to be happy, the robbers as well as the robbed. The banks are happy to be part of a cartel led by the central bank, which gives them immense latitude in indulging in consistent and flagrant overtrading of their capital, spurred on by the moral hazard created by having a \xe2\x80\x9clender of last resort\xe2\x80\x9d backstopping them, which can conjure up money out of thin air without limit. Politicians and bureaucrats are happy because there is very little restriction on their spending and there is nothing stopping them from buying votes or indulging in whatever pet projects they happen to dream up.\n\nAnd lastly, among the people who should actually rise in protest, there are large sub-groups that are either wards of the State and dependent on its largesse (the shameful secret of the welfare state is that it makes irresponsible slaves out of what would otherwise be free and responsible people), or have amassed so much debt in the pursuit of instant gratification that they are quite happy to see money being devalued at a steady pace. In a nation where the majority are debtors, inflation is the politically most palatable form of monetary policy. After all, everybody is focused on the short term (politicians and bureaucrats on their terms of office, consumers on their debt and their desire to buy more things they don\xe2\x80\x99t need with money they don\xe2\x80\x99t have, and so forth).\n\nFew people stop to consider that this policy means ruin in the long run. Over time, the middle and lower classes will see their real incomes and living standards shrink ever more, while the true beneficiaries of inflation \xe2\x80\x93 those who get first dibs on newly created fiat money \xe2\x80\x93 amass more and more wealth in a kind of reverse redistribution from later receivers.\n\n**Wealth Producers Have No Say**\n\nSavers and genuine wealth producers are put at a great disadvantage by inflation. Wealth generators have to contend with the fact that the creation of additional money creates a demand for scarce goods without a preceding contribution to the pool of savings. Nothing can be exchanged for something, and their own savings will no longer allow them to exercise demand for goods to the extent they expected.\n\nNot surprisingly, the small elite that actually profits from the fiat money system is quite content to take the long term view for itself. Actual producers of wealth are a very small group, too small to have a decisive voice in how things should be run. They would all have to go on strike if they wanted to exercise some pressure , a la John Galt. Unfortunately, big established businesses are usually in bed with the State and are happy with the status quo as well \xe2\x80\x93 their main aim is to keep competition from upstarts at bay, so they are quite content with the various methods by which the market economy is hampered. They give lip service to the idea of truly free, competitive markets, but concurrently lobby for anti-competitive regulations all the time.': 17, 'I respectfully submit that you understand none of: the fiat system, Bitcoin, the meaning of what is happening.': 1, '> In a nation where the majority are debtors, inflation is the politically most palatable form of monetary policy\n\nThis is putting the cart before the horse.

So, when I pay someone bitcoin it proves that I've done something of value at some point in the past. It's much more fair than a system where a central authority can just print money at will. Theoretically, the system cannot be corrupted. If you store your bitcoin securely (using either paper wallet or hardware wallet), it's about as close as theft proof a money that is possible. I believe once hardware wallets are integrated directly into all cell phones and that technology becomes mature, bitcoin will be deemed so hard to hack, that essentially the hackers give up. Something similar was seen in the spam war between spammers and gmail (which was documented by Mike Hearn). Eventually spammers just stopped targeting gmail and moved on. At this point, we'll have a currency that is in essence theft proof, either from counterfeiters (whether by a central bank or other counterfeiters) or hackers.

Proper coin storage, encryption, and not giving it to the wrong person are key to not losing your coins. it's not like all Dollars are protected from theft, fraud, or loss. I have never had a bank give me my money back after somebody used my card. I've lost about $10,000 to banks. I've also lost a few hundred paper dollars due to not being able to make a backup of my real wallet, which also contained s.s. card, IDs and credit cards.\n4.

There is absolutely nothing that can stop any of them. How about the fact that bitcoin is a far superior settlement network than existing systems like fedwire (which transmits $2.7 trillion per day between the 9000 member banks that are _ALLOWED_ to participate on this settlement network)? How about international settlements? Even today Coinbase and Coins.ph are already settling in bitcoin and are able to undercut the competition significantly.

I just wanted to explain my reasoning and respond to a few comments.\n\nI've been interested in Bitcoin since 2011. I was buying and using bitcoins back then just to see how they worked and what their viability would be. On a conceptual level, I personally think that they have great potential. The low transaction fees, anonymity, and decentralized nature of the coin are some great benefits. However, I think that their are some glaring structural issues at the heart of Bitcoin. Namely, the anonymity and the lack of any consumer protection. \n\nThe former is great because it makes it analogous to cash, but its a sad fact of governments today that they want to put an end to cash and have access to monitor every single persons bank accounts. I personally believe this Orwellian situation to be yet another intrusion by the state into its citizens lives. \n\nThe problem is that people just don't care enough about this uncomfortable fact. They simply want to watch dancing with the stars and other shit reality TV. People don't want to worry, the want to use what's easiest for them to keep them alive. \n\nThat's why you all in here, of the techy/libertarian crowd, who have invested time or money into Bitcoin, care about it. But on the list of of things I would recommend for my mother to invest into, Bitcoin would not be one of them. Physical gold yes, but not Bitcoin, because it lacks the history and the emotional connection people have with the former. \n\nNow, I know that Bitcoin is a modern cryptocurrency and not a physical substance which has been regarded as money since the dawn of recorded human history, but for the moment, most average people would probably equate the two together. Because of the price bubble, they view it as a speculative asset. The price has not trended with any markets nor has any recent political events given Bitcoin any new press.\n\nI think one of the reasons the bubble hit as high as it did for Bitcoin was that at the time of its meteoric rise, the events in Cyprus were just taking place. Capital controls had just been put into effect in the country and the world was scared that the contagion would spread to the rest of Europe. This fear drove up the price IMO, not the viability of the asset. \n\nLook at what's going on today. Greece may leave the Euro. Russia's currency is tanking, so is Nigeria's and Venezuela's. The Euro will probably hit parity with the dollar. The Yen is fucked. Every currency around the world is starting to show cracks of hitting the edge of what monetary intervention can do, yet Bitcoin is languishing lower and lower. If it really was a safe haven, people would be flocking to it. But its not. I don't even think a major monetary collapse of a G7 currency would save Bitcoin at this point.

In that case, the malware could attempt to modify the transaction before signing (for example, the malware could swap in a hacker's address/pub-key for the original recipient's address/pub-key). However, you can check the signed transaction before broadcasting it using your online machine, so any malware, whether software or hardware based, would have to have control of both machines (the offline machine used to sign the transaction and the online machine used to broadcast the transaction) in order to successfully divert payment to an attacker's address, assuming you double-check the transaction both during the signing and broadcasting process, which you should always do anyway for significant amounts of Bitcoin.\n\nHope this helps.

Many people mistakenly think the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) covers their loses after this type of attack; it does not.\n\n> FDIC Insurance does not protect you from ID theft, unauthorized access to funds, or hacker attacks.\n\n> FDIC Insurance applies to banks that have gone under, and only protect your money in the event of a bank failure. It does not protect you from someone gaining access to your account and stealing your money. Many bigger banks will reimburse your account if their security is breached, but most only do so to maintain the illusion of security. Many people have actually had to go to court to recover their funds after their bank refused to reimburse when their accounts were hacked.\n\n> Even more problematic for banking customers is if they are in some way responsible for their account being hacked. If a bank thinks your account was hacked because your personal information was obtained because a lack of security on your end, then the chances of the bank reimbursing your loses go down even more. A growing number of banks are starting to tell customers they should have been more careful with their passwords or personal data.": 1, "that's actually a really good analogy.  you trust them, because you know it's at least theoretically possible for you to verify what they say, and you know other people capable of doing so have in fact done do, so the multiple independent verifications give you a high degree of trust.\n\nit's the same reason you can usually trust widely used open source software... because you know multiple independent programmers have looked at it, and all it takes is one to sound the alarm.\n\nmost of the time that's safe.": 1, "I would say the possibility is so remote as to be trivial. You would need to have two instances of the same malware on different machines communicating with one another in a way that is not detectable by the user. If the systems are air-gapped and only one is connected to the internet, this would be incredibly difficult to pull off reliably as the only way for information to be conveyed between the two systems is the unsigned and signed transaction data itself, which could be formatted in many different ways depending on the software/hardware combination used. It's also worth noting that once a countermeasure is developed for said hardware-based malware the malware will not longer work properly on the offline machine since the malware cannot update itself to deal with countermeasures.\n\nI don't think anyone, even the NSA, would waste their time trying to develop such a complicated exploit that could be neutralized so easily.

The reason is that it has no protections whatsoever, from network or protocol shenanigans.  This is what bitcoind is for.  Right now, there's no choice: Armory relies on localhost Bitcoin-Qt/bitcoind, which if that is compromised, Armory is hosed anyway.  The first time it is allowed to connect to non-localhost (after it gets its own blockchain mgmt), I know people will start connecting it to untrusted nodes, not realizing that it's really bad news.  Armory has what it has because hiding behind a trusted bitcoind gives it all the security properties of bitcoind, without spending any time developing it (and probably doing a terrible job and forking the blockchain).  Instead, I've been able to focus on features, instead of re-doing what the core devs do.\n> \n> However, at some point, I will be splitting Armory into both directions:  lite-node and super-node.  The Armory super-node would be like the Electrum servers, allowing arbitrary address lookup.  It would be hiding behind a single bitcoind instance, and all the lite-nodes can connect directly to it.  I'm sure people will run malicious Armory super-nodes, but at least in this case, Armory lite-node is depending a lot less on that connection:  it basically turns their computer into an offline signing system (even though it's technically online) -- the super-node accumulated all the transaction data, and then gives it to the lite-node to sign.  Then the lite node can broadcast.

This version is required to use\n        Bitcoin Core 0.10 and newer.

The engine can now handle wallets with\n        millions of addresses and transactions!\n\n* **Rebuild Required (but much faster!)**\n        The new database engine requires rebuilding and rescanning.  You\n        will be prompted as soon as you start up 0.93 the first time.  \n        However, due to the new blockchain engine, this process is\n        considerably faster than before.

It is only \n        rebuilding the local databases that Armory creates for itself.\n        \n* **Improved Threading and Reliability**\n        With the new backend comes overhauled inter-thread messaging.  This \n        resolves a whole class of reliability issues that Armory has had in \n        the past, especially with large wallets and transaction histories.  \n\n* **Address and Wallet Importing in Background**\n        Importing wallets and addresses now induces background scans which\n        do not disable the interface (previously forced you into offline\n        mode for the duration of the scan).  \n        \n* **Supernode Mode**\n        Use the "--supernode" flag before creating the databases to create\n        a supernode database that enables instant address & wallet import.\n        This is an enabling feature for high-volume, consumer facing apps \n        and services to be built on Armory, such as exchanges and block-\n        explorers.  NOTE: Running with --supernode will result in an Armory\n        database approximately double the size of the blockchain!  \n        \n* **Improved armoryd.py**\n        The daemon version of armory, armoryd.py, has been fully updated and\n        tested with the new database engine.

If you have say 20 addresses with Bitcoin and now when you request info from a node you request for 300 address (280 of which are random and not yours) then since you continually are connecting to various different nodes then it's unlikely (possible but far reduced likelihood) that you will continually request the same 20 address of yours from the same node repeatedly then allowing the node to determine what address are yours.

The investigator may not learn you IP address if you connect through Tor, but can potentially read your full transaction history with much more clarity than the rest of the network.\n\nOne solution would be for Electrum to adopt some form of noisy filtering. Bloom filters are used with BitcoinJ, Bread wallet, and others.\n\nBut Bloom filters have limitations of their own:\n\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/2vrx6n/privacy_in_bitcoinj_android_wallet_multibit_hive/\n\nThis is a very difficult problem with no easy answers.\n\nOne proposal I remember seeing is to make checking an address optional. In other words, the "balance" of an address would read 0 until you checked it, or tried to create a transaction spending from it.': 5, 'No problem.': 2, "That's a good solution, but how does that help the masses who think they are transacting privately?": 2, "If I don't like it and want to use another one, what would you suggest?": 3, 'Whonix + Electrum.

When you don\'t use a full node, and you don\'t use Tor, your privacy is destroyed period.\n\n> it doesn\'t use the P2P network\n\nYour Bitcoin address history has to come from somewhere. Bitcoin doesn\'t have any magical P2P network that you can just blindly reach into without being tracked or logged. Doesn\'t exist.\n\nInformation can be retrieved from a node which you have no trust in, **over an unencrypted connection**; or it can come from a known node which, because it is known, you can connect to over SSL. In both cases, the node you connect to can be keeping logs. But without SSL, any passive observer could link your addresses to your IP, not just the unknown peer, but *anyone*.\n\nBloom filtering "pseudo-serverless" SPV has big downsides, the first being a lack of SSL support. When you connect to an unknown server to retrieve your address data, you\'re doing that in the clear, unencrypted. ANYONE listening in on that connection has the chance to deanonymize you.\n\nWhen you use MultiBit, Schildbach\'s Android Wallet, Bread Wallet or other bloom filtering SPV wallets, your one and only form of privacy is false positives. Your wallet requests more data than it needs in order to confuse snooping peers. The effectiveness of this bloom filtering approach is very debateable. Plus, even if you were to think false positives based privacy model is workable, you can create the same false positive rate with Electrum, by simply adding fake watch-only addresses to your wallet.\n\nBottom line, no matter what your wallet is, if it\'s not a full node, you need Tor to stay anonymous. To this end, Electrum has been added to [Tails](https://tails.boum.org/), and you should have no problem remaining as anonymous as you want with Tails + Electrum. Electrum has had fantastic Tor support for years, so you don\'t need to use Tails, but that\'s unquestionably the most foolproof option for an anonymous ephemeral Bitcoin wallet. Don\'t believe the hype about pseudo-serverless bloom filtering SPV. It is based on widespread misconceptions in the Bitcoin community.': 3, "The analysis is correct but I would add that Tor doesn't help much here. You end up with a pseudonymous list of all your addresses in someone else's possession. Additionally, every time you make a tx the other party is able to link your real world identity to one of your addresses (the exception being darknet transactions).\n\nIf those two separate pieces of information are combined, then other people can learn your entire tx history. The more transactions you make, the greater the probability that this could happen to you. \n\nPart of the reason I'm working on an alternative communication channel which can be used to send payments directly to the recipient.": 1, 'Same with any merchant.': 1, 'Sorry I misread. There were some other people in the thread posting confused reactions.': 3, 'Are you disagreeing with something I wrote?': 4, 'They should Tails + Electrum.': 2, "All SPV wallet communications are tracked and logged. Without a full node, and without Tor, your privacy is fucked. No, there's no way to get around it! Your data has to come from someone running a Bitcoin node somewhere. Who is that person? Do you know? With MultiBit and other pseudo-serverless Bloom filtering SPV wallets, YOU DON'T. You have no idea who you're connecting to, or who could be listening in. Privacy = rekt!\n\nMaking matters worse for MultiBit, if you don't coordinate with someone to retrieve your data, as in MultiBit and other pseudo-serverless Bloom filtering SPV implementations, you can't possibly encrypt your communications to that other person. Traditionally, this has been solved with X.509 certs which you need to obtain in advance to have any semblance of a workable wallet. Otherwise you can only retrieve data over plain text, which is horridly awful for privacy. With MultiBit, you're literally stuck broadcasting your IP and your complete list of Bitcoin addresses OVER PLAIN TEXT. How could that *possibly* be any more private than making an SSL encrypted connection to a known entity from behind Tor?\n\nAnd what is so centralized about a federated network of Electrum servers? If you're so concerned about the server learning your addresses, you can do any of the following:\n\n- Add fake watch-only addresses to your Electrum wallet. With that, you now have the same false positive based privacy model as MultiBit.\n\n- Run Bitcoin-QT. You can import your Electrum addresses offline into a Bitcoin-QT full node without ever connecting to a server.\n\n- Run Tails + Electrum. Easiest choice and provides very strong anonymity.\n\n- Run your own Electrum server. Hardest choice but offers a similar privacy model to Bitcoin-QT, since it uses Bitcoin-Core in the background.": 3}, ("We've added a Guarantee for bills paid at BILLPAYFORCOINS..", 10): {}, ('Rick Falkvinge says bitcoin will hit $5 million', 12): {'$5 Million?

How do you think the world/community would respond if Satoshi is revealed to have once worked for the NSA?": 2, 'There are a few ways the question of Satoshi is (unfortunately) relevant to bitcoin, both as an asset/currency and as a technology. \n\n**Asset Related**: If he resurfaces, the question that comes to mind is: Will he sell his coins and crash the market? What\'s his endgame?\n\nMore importantly / also asset related: Satoshi has done something that many have been killed/jailed for, which is to fight against the US Dollar and reign of fiat money. He also owns 1 million bitcoin, the ultimate "bearer asset". The question here is: Who will try to kill him first governments or criminal organisations? If he was killed, the price should arguably rise significantly as the supply of total bitcoin will have contracted immensely. \n\n**Technology Related**: Many open source technologies have a [BDFL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benevolent_dictator_for_life) or a Benevolent Dictator for Life. Right now Gavin Andresen is certainly a candidate for eventually being bitcoin\'s BDFL, however Satoshi is the "God", "Jesus" or "Neo" figure in religious aspect of bitcoin and so if he returned he would have immense sway over technological chances in bitcoin, from a hearts-and-minds perspectives. \n\nI think Satoshi is very likely Nick Szabo. Hopefully Nick Szabo is also a pseudonym, but I do know several people who have known Nick personally for 20+ years, so it would have had to be a longstanding pseudonym. We\'ll see what happens, but I hope for his sake that he doesn\'t reveal his identity and also that he never posts anything ever again. However, as many have pointed out previously - if he ever wants to cash out his massive bitcoin wealth, he will inevitably give up his identity (to at least one other person) since bitcoin is not anonymous.

Plus, he's literally the first person to admit to using Bitcoin. He was one half (possibly both halves) of the first Bitcoin transaction. \n\nPersonally, I still don't think Hal Finney is Satoshi. I don't think we'll ever hear Satoshi's real name; I bet Satoshi never made any serious contributions to cryptography outside of Bitcoin, and if Satoshi hasn't come out by now, we should hold our breath for a big announcement. We're almost definitely never going to find out the true identity of Satoshi. But if there's anyone out there (who we know of) who could possibly be Satoshi's true identity, I bet it'd be Hal Finney.

Unlike ETFs, where any qualified investor can issue and redeem using underlying assets, thereby indirectly regulating the supply and demand in secondary markets (there would be arbitrage opportunity if the secondary market price is incorrect), BitShares only enforce the BitAsset/BitShares price using price floors determined by distributed agents.\n\nThere's nothing intrinsically wrong with this. The price will still be correct (as long as the agents are honest, which we can assume so). If for some reason the market participants stop believing that 1 bitUSD = 1 USD, the price still can't deviate from 1:1, which is by design, and is great. However, the cost will be the lack of liquidity. (Microeconomics 101: Price floor above equilibrium price results in excess supply and fall in volume/liquidity.)\n\nCoinJar Hedged Account, on the other hand, is the first solution that will actually allow you to redeem at least one currency being hedged to. If you're verified, you can instantly convert 1 AUD in Hedged Account to 1 AUD in Cash Account at just 1% unhedge fee, and withdraw to your bank account for free. Also unlike other centralised hedging solutions like Coinapult or Bitreserve, this ensures that CoinJar will have to maintain price convergence of at least one fiat currency being hedged to. Liquidity is also guaranteed.\n\nBack to BitShares: I think it's anyone familiar with BitShares should know that bitUSD is not backed by real USD.  It's issued through short sellers opening positions, and redeemed through short sellers closing positions. The way I understand about it is that it's an imaginary asset that has to trade 1:1 with USD (trades at any other price will be rejected by the network). It's a genius idea, but I believe that liabilities of a trusted corporate may work better than an imaginary asset for frequent hedging requiring instant liquidity.": 1, 'If they are holding your coins, then there is a clear couter-party risk.

Soon I believe you will be able to issue bitUSD with other market-pegged assets.(secondary markets) not sure if this is what you mean though.\n\n>the way I understand about it is that it\'s an imaginary asset that has to trade 1:1 with USD (trades at any other price will be rejected by the network).\n\nThat\'s incorrect.  You can actually trade any Asset at any price above or below the feed(even without a feed).  Its completely without restriction.  Only New shorts issuing new assets are required to sell at the feed price.\n\n>If for some reason the market participants stop believing that 1 bitUSD = 1 USD, the price still can\'t deviate from 1:1, which is by design, and is great. However, the cost will be the lack of liquidity. \n\nAll shorts are required to close their positions every 30 days thus generating monthly turnover liquidity.  In 30 days you are essentially guaranteed liquidity at 1 to 1. typically you will not have to wait anywhere near 30 days and liquidity improves as more people use it.\n\n>anyone familiar with BitShares should know that bitUSD is not backed by real USD.\n\nIt is backed though, and by 200% to 300% collateral.  So long as BTS are convertible to fiat or bitcoin, gold,silver etc.  The argument of "not backed by *whatever*"  doesn\'t hold.  Its not immediately obvious I admit, similar to the "no intrinsic value" arguments against bitcoin.  Nothing has "intrinsic" value.   Anyway, It ultimately doesn\'t matter what something is backed by, so long as its liquid and there is some expectation that the backing will maintain enough collateral.  The Bitshares protocol enforces this. \n\nHope that helps. : )  \n\n': 1, "don't get zhou tonged": 3, 'lol, can you imagine that?

Then some yahoo comes along and buys a coffee just after you\'ve submitted your carefully crafted transaction and completely blows the utility of any answer.\n\nWorse: the next block hash is dependent on the previous block -- so that coffee has blown your chance of appropriating that hashing power not just for this block, but for every subsequent block as well.
