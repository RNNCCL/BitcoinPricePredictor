This is a pure and simple [fact](http://cpgblogger.blogspot.nl/):\n\n> For Bitcoin, we want to do better than that, but as these numbers illustrate, even tens to hundreds of thousands of transactions would not satisfy the world\'s demand for payments. The block sizes required for these amounts are unfathomable today and, even if we experience 17.7% growth in bandwidth and other technologies (as indicated as the growth rate of bandwidth by **Cisco** referenced by Peter Wuille in BIP103), there is little hope for Bitcoin as is to scale to the levels required to support all the world\'s transactions any time soon. This is not even to get into settling stocks/bonds/and other securities on the blockchain.\n>\n> This means, that without question, unless Bitcoin is a failure (or just a niche success), Bitcoin blocks will eventually fill up. Therefore, a fee event indicates success of the Bitcoin network because it means that demand outstrips supply. The real questions the community should be asking is: when do we want them to fill up? and what do we do when they do fill up?\n>\n> ([continued](http://cpgblogger.blogspot.nl/2016/01/bitcoin-why-fee-event-would-be-good-for.html))\n\nA $0.10 fee backlog is small potatoes in the scheme of Bitcoin\'s success. It may not be "good", but technology doesn\'t exactly leave us any better options after a while. In the meantime, you can bump your fee to $0.25, which is still very competitive with online payment systems, which Bitcoin itself is NOT. BTC is gold, while Coinbase and Lightning are E-Gold.

Negative externalities mean that if no action is taken to counteract it, the communal resources are increasingly degraded which is a cost felt by everyone equally, but contributed to unequally. Satoshi\'s original rationale behind the fee was to avoid the risk of DoSing the network with big blocks, and there will surely come a day when the userbase "demands" blocks larger than can be reasonably supplied in a decentralized manner.\n\nFor example, what would you do if you bump to 64MB blocks and 500M+ people adopt Bitcoin?

Maybe it will just be bitcoin transactions flying across the existing Visa/MasterCard/etc networks"\n- [Mike Hearn](https://en.bitcoin.it/w/index.php?title=Scalability&oldid=3555): "probably 2 or 3 racks of machines"\n\n> No, it\'s completely distributed at the moment. That will begin to change as we scale up. I don\'t want to oversell BitCoin. As we scale up there will be bumps along the way. I\'m confident of it. Why? For example, as the volume of transactions come up--right now, I can run BitCoin on my personal computer and communicate over my DSL line; and I get every single transaction that\'s happening everywhere in the world. As we scale up, that won\'t be possible any more. If there are millions of bitcoin transactions happening every second, that will be a great problem for BitCoin to have--means it is very popular, very trusted--but obviously I won\'t be able to run it on my own personal computer. **It will take dedicated fleets of computers with high-speed network interfaces, and that kind of big iron to actually do all that transaction processing**. I\'m confident that will happen and that will evolve. But right now all the people trying to generate bitcoins on their own computers and who like the fact that they can be a self-contained unit, I think they may not be so happy if BitCoin gets really big and they can no longer do that.\n\nCan you see that it\'s rather futile to have Lightning if we cross that line and turn Bitcoin into a centralized DatacenterCoin?

It's growing from a puddle to a pond.": 1, '> One of the common arguments against a HF to increase the block size is that there are benefits to establishing a transaction fee market.\n\nThis is not a common argument. Miners have plenty of incentive now. That\'s why experts aren\'t worried about the impending subsidy decrease. Bitcoin would be fine with half or a quarter as much mining power as now. Mining rewards won\'t be a major issue to worry about for at least 4 years.\n\nWhen experts talk about fees in reference to the current block size issue, I think what they tend to mainly be concerned about are these things (and not "we need more fees *now*"):\n\n* Because demand varies over time and blocks are and usually should be mostly full, Bitcoin should be able to handle a fee market. It\'s normal and nothing to be afraid of. Wallets that don\'t do something like Core\'s `estimatefee` are simply broken. I have *never* had a transaction get permanently stuck, and even though I try to pay the lowest fees possible, I very rarely have transactions take more than a few blocks to get a confirmation.\n* The community should not get into the habit of expecting a max block size increase whenever demand exceeds supply. Scarcity is a normal part of the universe, and Bitcoin will not collapse due to scarcity of block space. While 2 MB would be safe now, and steps are being taken to increase the max block size to 2 MB very soon, these blocks will quickly get filled again, and significantly larger block sizes are probably *not* safe right now. If it\'s a choice between low fees and decentralization, the correct choice is decentralization.\n* It\'s impossible for Bitcoin to directly support even a decent chunk of the world\'s transactions while still retaining its competitive/useful properties (decentralization, etc.). For smallish transactions, off-chain systems are the only long-term option. Hopefully fees will remain *rather* low (below $1) forever, but doing every coffee transaction on-chain isn\'t going to work long-term.\n\nToday, the issue with larger blocks is centralization risk. 8 MB blocks would for example require so much bandwidth (especially upload bandwidth) that it\'d exclude too many people from being full nodes. (Also, the network would probably just fall apart as things are currently.) Almost all experts agree that 2 MB would be safe if various DoS issues are addressed, which is why there will be an increase of the max block size to *roughly* 2 MB via a softfork around April (SegWit), and maybe this will be solidified to *definitely/always* 2 MB in 2017 sometime (the Hong Kong hardfork proposal). I could see further increases to 4-8 MB in 2017 or 2018 if IBLT and/or weak blocks are successfully implemented sometime this year as planned and if they end up providing the expected benefits.': 3}, ('Next evolution in Bitcoin security: Hardware wallet right in your phone!', 140): {">The main problem of TEE/TrustZone is that the TEE/TrustZone lies in the same package as the main CPU, so one cannot audit what kind of communication happens between these two. \n\nyou can't audit either what happens in any CPU, so it's probably time to get back to ECDSA with pen and paper :)\n\n>Hell, even the broadband chip that connects to GSM is in the package. \n\nThose issues have been hyped to hell (close second to BadUSB) but I'm still waiting for a proof of concept.

The TEE puts the full application logic in the protected area, so even if a malware gains kernel level access it wouldn't be able to fake the user approval (if there is a Trusted UI) or the second factor (if there is no Trusted UI)": 2, 'I have a brand new Samsung S5 Neo.

It shares the same CPU HW. But yeah, if done right apps in TZ are a lot secure than apps in the Mobile OS. ': 5, "Has there ever been a case where malware got kernel level access on iOS? I haven't seen anything reported.": 1, 'This is awesome! Great work, guys!\n\nThis type of thing definitely needs a video to demonstrate the functionality, though.

How could that be done on a phone with only one screen, couldn't an attacker with kernel level access do basically whatever they want?\n": 1, 'Will this work on +1 phones? (Please say yes) ': 5, 'Unfortunately not - it only works on Trustonic TEEs for the time being': 3, 'How many private keys could the TEE hold?\n': 1, "The TEE is there, but doesn't have the Trusted UI driver - so there'll be a different mechanism to protect the account, typically a server enforcing a daily spending quota, or something close to that. This will allow users to keep more bitcoins on their mobile wallet without worrying too much. ": 2, "oh, no. a new phone again. first USB to go, then this chip :). Unless it's a great demand, maybe the chip will not be available in new devices?": 1, 'The installation process is quite painful and will get better once Samsung sorts out a certificate provisioning issue (we currently have to push 2 applications due to a provisioning problem). The application is not Open Source but is built around a minimalist kernel, so the wallet itself could be rewritten as an Open Source application running on top of it. More information about that in the coming weeks.': 1, "It's quite different to unlock a phone and to install a malware after the phone has been unlocked. Also those exploits are clearly the worse kind for the security of the platform and are patched quickly.": 1, 'Oh, you mean like Breadwallet?': 3, "oh ok, it doesn't hold directly single private keys, but people will be able to code extensions for that - more details on those extensions coming soon": 1, 'I was trying to evaluate Ledger TrustIet in the Android App store, to see if it supported my Galaxy S5 and then I read that Samsung has pushed the Galaxy S6 into the enterprise with Trustonic for Knox. \n\nhttp://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/2400470/samsung-looks-to-push-galaxy-s6-into-the-enterprise-with-trustonic-for-knox\n\nSo it seems the Galaxy S5 is not supported.  Going forward I will probably buy an s6, S7 or perhaps a Galaxy Tab S2. My hope is to use the Ledger Trustlet, continue to use my two Ledger nanos, but not purchase Ledger Blue.  Maybe if you design a hardware ring, or a hardware wristband (can TEE be inside a smartwatch?), I will seriously consider those form factors.  For now I like Ledger and look forward to ether hardware support.  Excellent work!': 1, "The app says my device is not compatible. I'm using S6 and your ledger wallet service is performed without any problem.": 1, 'More work to support more phones.

One of the people could steal any funds put in that address by the other.\n\nIt's so astronomically unlikely to happen, though, that it isn't a problem.": 2, 'First thing is you misunderstand what private keys, public keys and addresses are. So let\'s clear that up first. \n\nPrivate keys are 256bit random numbers. Private keys are never made public. They remain secret.\n\nPublic keys are derived from private keys and are mathematically related to them. You can\'t derive a private key from a public key. Each private key has just one public key. They are called a key pair. The public key is revealed to the world and the world uses it to verify transaction signatures generated by your secret private key without you having to expose said private key to the world. Bitcoin public keys are also 256bits.\n\nHash functions - Hash functions take arbitrary sized data and output numbers of a fixed size. They are one way functions. You can\'t take the output of a hash function and determine the input. Hash functions are used to create "fingerprints" of data. If even a single bit in the data changes the output of the hash function will change.\n\nBitcoin addresses are public keys run through hash functions. The hash functions used result in 160bit addresses.\n\nBecause 256bits is greater than 160bits all addresses can be unlocked by more than one public/private key pair. That\'s where the 2^96 comes from. But this refers to key pairs behind bitcoin addresses not private keys behind public keys. An address is not the same as a public key. It is the public key run through hash functions.\n\nThere is such a thing as a deterministic wallet and that uses a single random number to generate a whole tree of addresses. We don\'t call that random number a private key though. We call it a seed. Each address there has its own private key and they are indistinguishable from randomly generated keys to anyone who doesn\'t have the seed.': 14, 'AFAIK, you can only derive two public keys from a private, one positive and one negative.\n\nOr am I misunderstanding something?': 0, "Best ELI5 ever.

I might add that such an adversary would probably get better results with rubber-hose cryptanalysis ([relevant xkcd](https://xkcd.com/538/))\n\nI consider myself a typical bitcoin user (with bitcoin a representing single-digit percentage of my net worth), and my main concerns are:\n\n1. Phishing/malware/keyloggers stealing my wallet passwords as I type it - mitigated by using a cheap dedicated bitcoin-only off-line PC, and e.g. smartphone security hygiene.\n\n2. A somewhat motivated, knowledgeable adversary, e.g. a work colleage or an acquaintance who might know about my interest in bitcoin, where I live etc. This can be countered by not leaving passwords in obvious places, not using trivial passwords, using strong 2FA on any online exchange/wallet accounts etc.\n\n3. State actors, law-enforcement, etc. This is unlikely but can happen, e.g. if you are sued for damages etc. One defence against that is to use multisig, with keys in different jurisdictions. Even different countries if possible, or with your lawyer etc.\n\n4. Incapacitation. If I'm not around (for the moment or more permanently), I would still want my next of kin to have access to my bitcoins. This can be handled again with multisig, services like google inactive account manager (but with 2FA!) etc.\n": 1, 'fun story. good job on recovering it.': 1, "What you could do is hash some private details about yourself for a whole week (sounds like a long time TBH) and from the payload create a brainwallet, in that case if you forget your random sentence you can always wait a week to recover it (from your private details).  \nA week is a long time to crack your details, what if you forget your initial details and need to do some guess work, I'd say a few hours is enough.  \n&nbsp;  \nThere are other ways though, [coinvault.io](https://www.coinvault.io) for example will give you a backup of your encrypted wallet using your wallet password but your password is also encrypted with their master key so if you forget the wallet password you can always recover it with their help but they don't have access to your password": 1, "I mean... you're going to have a counter right?

As soon as your scheme is known, it is trivially vulnerable to attack, especially if you use a small dictionary.\n\nThink of the private key as cash in your wallet. The only reason it is secure is because it's on your person, and because people have to have physical access to it. What you're looking for in a password is protection from arms-length hackers. Because of that, it is best to choose a key that is difficult for hackers to guess, but that you can protect physically as if it were a physical $100 bill *and* a secret known to you and trusted people around you.\n\nSo go ahead and write down that password and stick it in your wallet or in your passport.
