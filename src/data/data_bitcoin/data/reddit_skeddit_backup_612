They will eventually age out if no one wants to mine them (a very tiny output with no fee, for example) but that may take days.\n\nWhen a block is being built, all of the included transactions are put together, and a hash is taken of them.  The result of this hash is placed in the block header.  This operation is dependant on the number of transactions in the block, and might take a respectable fraction of a second. On a slow PC.  The block header is then hashed trillions of times, each time with a slightly different random number, looking for a hash with enough leading zeros to qualify.\n\nOne place where size is arguably relevant is in network propagation.  It may be faster to send a ~100k block across the network than a 1MB (or 20MB or more in the future).  There is work being done ("invertable bloom filters",  whatever the hell those are....) to moot this issue.': 2, '> Is it allowed for them to drop transactions at their discretion?\n\nYup.  Miners can ignore or include transactions as they choose.  They can even include illegal transactions, but if they do that, no other nodes will accept such blocks.\n\n> Would other nodes compute the block, see a different hash and create a fork, drop the other candidate block or something?\n\nAll (mining) nodes are all working on their own version of block "X".  The included transactions don\'t have to (and in practice, probably don\'t) match.  Once a node finds a winning hash, it announces it to the network:  "I have found block X!  Here it is!".  All other nodes check the math, and if it\'s correct, start working on block "X+1".\n\nIt\'s also possible for two miners to submit equally correct (but different) blocks to the network at the same time.  When this happens (and this is an over-simplification) the one seen and accepted first by the most nodes becomes the defacto node "X".  The loser gets orphaned.\n\n> If it was the case, what would stop a node from saying it solved a block with 0 transactions and get a 25 BTC reward? That should compute must faster than a block with the real number of transactions.\n\nhttps://blockchain.info/block/00000000000000000ca3ada142cee38de5d99b5817b0231197d902cd2d298450\n\nIt happens.The work isn\'t in finding transactions to include, it\'s finding the right hash, so there is no incentive to ignore transactions.': 1, 'only one transaction will be included in a block on the longest chain.

Otherwise, another block will probably pick it up.\n\n> Would other nodes compute the block, see a different hash and create a fork, drop the other candidate block or something? Gets a bit advanced for me, but I find it weird a node would be able to do that.\n\nThey *could*, if they could compute the block, but remember that the block is difficult to compute, otherwise there wouldn't only be one every 10 minutes.  However, forks do happen when two people compute a block at around the same time.  The solution is that you can mine on whichever block you want.  The first person to mine the *next* block determines which tied block wins by having built on one of the two tied blocks. Now *that* block is in the longest chain, and the other block is a dead end.  \n\n> If it was the case, what would stop a node from saying it solved a block with 0 transactions and get a 25 BTC reward? \n\nNothing; that's technically possible.  But why pass up the fees associated with transactions?  This is why you hear that 0 fee transactions take longer; not every miner will include them.\n\n> That should compute must faster than a block with the real number of transactions.\n\nIt's generally negligible, and would only make a difference if two blocks were found at almost exactly the same time.  There's also proposed (implemented?) solutions for this where only pointers to txns are transmitted and then filled in later.\n\n": 3, 'You can...

The value of a bitcoin is tied to its utility, and a bitcoin is only useful to the extent that the bitcoin network remains decentralized.  Therefore, if the decentralization of the network is threatened, it is rational for miners to act to protect the network, because it is in their long term best interest.  Otherwise, it will not matter if they mine a few extra bits in the largest pool, because those bits will be worthless if Bitcoin can be manipulated by a central point of control who can stop payments and alter the money supply.  Also, the value of any hardware the miner has purchased to mine would be wiped out.\n\nCritics say miners will not leave the largest pool, but will blindly act in their short term best interest by remaining in the largest pool to mine a few extra bits (aka "the tragedy of the commons").  But we know miners have left the largest pool at least three times in Bitcoin\'s history because those pools are no longer the largest.  In 2011, Deepbit was by far the largest pool with over 40%.  Miners left the pool and eventually by 2013 BTCGuild became the largest.  When BTCGuild began growing too large, miners started leaving and in 2014 Ghash started getting too big.
