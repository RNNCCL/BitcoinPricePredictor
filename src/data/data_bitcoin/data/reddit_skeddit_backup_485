"Just save your revoke link" is a pretty big caveat.\n\nI realise that people like instant gratification and don\'t like downloading things, so let me briefly repeat why I implemented Lighthouse as a desktop app.\n\nA UX that *requires* bookmarking a link without clicking it is odd and some users will forget to save their revoke link, or they\'ll lose the link, or they\'ll do it wrong. Then if the project never completes the money is effectively destroyed.\n\nIt\'s common for browsers like Chrome to back up bookmarks to a server side account. That\'s reasonable because bookmarks never normally contain sensitive information beyond which sites you like. Storing actual money in a bookmark changes things quite significantly and means people who are known to have used lightlist.io might have their Google accounts attacked in order to obtain access to the bookmark storage. The anti-hacking systems I designed when I worked for Google can fend off large scale automated attacks, but focused human driven attacks are much harder to solve (2SV is a good idea: use it).\n\nAdditionally, as lightlist.io is effectively creating wallets for people on the fly in the browser, they may come under attack from malware and bogus browser extensions that simply steal the pledged money. Wallet stealing malware is a common problem in the Bitcoin space. Well, they could implement password protection as Lighthouse does, but a Javascript version of scrypt will be far slower than native code so the encryption won\'t be anywhere near as strong.\n\nThen they have the issue that web sites are often easily hackable. They\'re rendering user-generated content on the same origin that\'s generating and storing private keys. If there\'s an XSS exploit then (again) people\'s money can be stolen. Or if the server is exploited it can serve bad code to people that steals their funds.\n\nEvery issue I listed above has a potential resolution, but as you add features to solve problems like this ...... eventually you end up making a regular wallet.\n\nSo by all means, please do make small pledges via lightlist.io and enjoy the convenience of their service. But if you\'re considering pledging a large amount of money I\'d suggest using the app. It\'s not perfect and some of its solutions to the above listed problems are only partially complete, but the roadmap is in place to solve them all.': 3, "I don't actually see how to pledge on the site without installing Lighthouse.

Bitcoin is in fact the first global electronic currency to have even been developed.\n\n>The anonymity afforded to users of Bitcoins forms the basis for the major impact of Bitcoins: removal\nof the need for a 'third-party verifier' of transactions. Bitcoin usage would help to 'de-fragment' the\nglobal financial market, which has always been the preferred market model by banks around the\nworld seeking to (thus far) prevent the emergence of a global electronic currency. This therefore offers\na number of potentially highly-positive impacts stemming from the fact that use of virtual currency\ncould be cheaper, easier and faster than existing methods of payments. For example, users of Bitcoins\ndo not need to use bank accounts, with the associated credit and security checks that make their use\ncomplicated in comparison, simply accessing a 'digital wallet' via an internet connection.\nTransaction costs of making payments for goods and services should fall dramatically were virtual\ncurrencies to be more widely used. This would help smaller business and 'start-ups' as this type of\nrunning cost can disproportionately impact upon their operating expenditure capacities.

With an enlarging of\nmarkets for good and services, accompanied by faster personal and business transactions across\ninternational borders, the impacts for the EU's and the global economy are potentially massive.\nFurthermore, if virtual currencies were to be embraced by financial institutions this could usher in a\nnew era of highly secure, cheaper, and easier to access means of payment.\n": 3}, ('/r/BitcoinThailand created', 73): {'Can i buy underage prostitutes with bitcoin now?': -2, "I'm in Pattaya forever :)\n\nThere seems to be a lot of bitcoin activity in Bangkok, but little elsewhere.

This will go on until either the banks or the consumers are reluctant to take the risk of giving out or taking on the debt - this is ideally steered partly with the interest rate.

Once the money has been moved out by the person who borrowed the money from the bank, the bank is sitting on $0 cash, yet an asset and a liability of equal amounts.  The initial deposit of 200K into the bank (by a poor schmo) gives the bank 200k cash (money) and 200k liability (to pay back said schmo).  The loan gives the bank -200k cash (money) and 200k asset (accounts receivable).  Thus, once the money is transferred out of the bank, the bank is left with $0 cash, a 200k asset and a 200k liability.  Where the bank creates money out of thin air is interest.  It loans out 200k but expects more than that in return.  If everyone wanted to pay back their debts today, there would not be enough money to go around.  Simple example.  You and your dad live in a country with an money reserve of $1.  Your father gives you a loan of $1 with 5%.  The 5% interest... where does it come from?  That\'s the creation of money.  In the 200k example, the 200k exists, it\'s just not yours or the bank\'s, it belong to the original depositor.

Modern economics fully understand how commercial banks create money. The 3 theories he made up are in fact 3 parts of the same mechanism. Commercial banks creating money in the way they found is exactly what is expected to happen in a standard fractional reserve system. How is fractional reserve supposed to work if commercial banks cannot create money? The Fed\'s role is to limit the cap on money creation, the creation itself is always done through the loan maker, aka commercial banks. This is known, it is expected,it is exactly how fractional reserve works. \n\nIn fact, the whole reason why fed policies fail to impact the market directly through interest rate or fractional reserve adjustments is because banks don\'t necessarily make loans just because they have the ability to. If the money is  on being loaned by the commercial bank , they are not being created. This isn\'t some sort of puzzle. This is known, this is an expected problem. This is observable. It was observed in 2007/8 when commercial banks just stopped lending, irregardless of fed policies to induce their behavior. \n\nThis whole paper is a joke. It\'s as if the whole thing is written by someone who fundamentally don\'t understand how fractional reserve system works. \n\nBanks are regulated. They are forced to hold x percent of all loans as fractional reserve. That\'s a cap on the max amount of loans they can give at any capital levels. This is the basis of the fractional reserve system. They does not, in any way, mean they they are supposed to move funds from internal accounts to a loan account. It does not mean that they need to immediately adjust internal capital the moment loans are made (it only means they need to find more capital if they exceed their legal cap) . The only thing they need to do is to look at their liabilities, their assets, add in calculations for risk adjustment and make sure that the ratio does not exceed a given value. To expect otherwise is to fundamentally misunderstand fractional reserve. \n\nThis whole paper is just blatantly stupid. It got everything in wrong, from its premise to its conclusion. The fact that they are people thinking this is some sort of great unveiling of misconduct or economic revelation is hilarious.

My only point is that what we\'re calling \'money\' in this case is literally the demand deposit accounting liabilities on the balance sheet of the commercial banks. So you want to shy away from thinking of this as some kind of magical alchemy, where banks are cooking up money in their basement like a mad scientist, which they then just \'have\' or get to \'lend out\'. \n\nThe bank is just promising to pay their customer on demand, in exchange for the customer promising to pay the bank the same amount plus interest over time (loan) or in exchange for the customer giving the bank the government\'s IOU (cash/reserves). So in any case it\'s an IOU swap, and we only colloquially call the commercial bank\'s IOU as part of \'money\' aggregates (while the loan customer\'s IOU is an asset for the bank, but rarely do we call that money).\n\nThe primary restraint on bank lending is, first & foremost, credit-worthy borrowers coming in the door and asking for credit. So that\'s why anyone talking about fractional reserve money multipliers doesn\'t fully know what they\'re talking about. You can have no reserve requirements and 0% discount rate, and banks still might not be able to lend if the economy sucks and people don\'t want to borrow. The primary regulatory restraint on bank lending is capital requirements, so basically the asset-side of the balance sheet rather than the liability-side (reserve constraint). And I agree with what you wrote about asset bubbles, overly-valued financial collateral, and moral hazard of bailouts.': 1, "So long as the bank does not exceed the fractional reserve limits imposed, they can absolutely create credit from nothing. In the simplest case, if they have 10 dollars, the reserve limit is 10 percent and they have loan outstanding of 50, they can create 50 dollars of loans anytime they want out of nothing. Banks are not exactly at the limit all the time and need to readjust their capital everything they give a loan. \n\nUp till you are actually at the reserve limit, the commercial banks are operating on zero reserve. Because reserve limit only matters if you hit it. \n\nAs you said, the guidelines for internal  accounting is complex, which makes the authors expectation regarding movements in internal accounts an infantile expectation. His whole premise was flawed to begin with, given that commercial banks creating money is a part of fractional reserve.

When they\'re using reserves, they\'re not creating any money. (To be accurate the Treasury does hold TT&L accounts at commercial banks, but these are used for more nuanced purposes).\n\nIn any case the central bank does practically directly monetize the government debt, although they add a few steps in the middle to abide by the Federal Reserve Act self-imposed constraints.

Yes.\n\nThrough methods such as sidechannels (which is extremely hard, but in the near future may not be all that unrealistic) on poorly written signing software (which sadly includes the most commonly used library, openSSL) it is possible to derive/estimate the private key used in a signature. This involves having very intimate access to your signing device such that it's possible to obtain power consumption, timing, things like that.\n\nI wouldn't say that's very realistic for, say, a mobile phone. And I definitely wouldn't say it's realistic this were to happen in a public setting, but it's a worry that's getting increasingly more attention, which is a good thing.\n\nFurther, if there's ever a vulnerability detected in ECDSA (the signature algorithm) which allows you to derive more information about the private key given knowledge of a bunch of signatures, then yes, this is a problem. Which is the reason you should never reuse an address (reducing the layers of security on top of a private key containing unspent coins down to ECDSA only, rather than ECDSA, plus SHA256 and RIPE-MD: two hashing algorithms serving as additional layers of security on top of a private key)\n\n---\n\nAs for realistic risks (made possible through MITM).

But bear in mind that a malicious public WiFi operator, or anyone MITM'ing your connection may abuse insecure communication to, for example, display a payment address other than the one you're supposed to send to. Essentially tricking you into sending bitcoin to the attacker instead of the merchant.\n\nBitcoin is not a reason to start using insecure communications channels everywhere. Bitcoin transactions themselves *can* be sent over the wire as-is without worry, but other than that you should never put your full faith in an insecure connection (such as when paying for stuff).\n\nTL;DR - Like online banking, use HTTPS (or equivalently secure) for (e-)shopping.": 2, 'Satoshi\'s vision was to have mining rewards taper off slowly while transaction fees rose steadily.

They are there to allow clients to skip part of the verification process (by not executing scripts) for historic transactions before the checkpoint.\n\nCheck out this talk by Core dev Peter Wuille on Bitcoin Core 0.10, including headers-first:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/l3O4nh79CUU?t=659\n\nThe bit that answers your question is at 11:10, start watching from 9:20 for the full section.\n\n// Edit:\n\nTo expand a bit more.\n\nCheckpoints exist *primarily* to skip full verification of blocks *before* a checkpoint. They *also* allow you to prevent massive reorganisations, but if that ever happens then bitcoin has failed completely, because to revert the blockchain all the way down to a checkpoint and reorganise from there is consensus-breaking and should be impossible by design. So again, checkpoints exist to skip verification of blocks *before* a checkpoint.\n\nSo, why does headers-first improve upon this so we can get rid of checkpoints entirely?\n\nPreviously, peers would only feed you block hashes, which is only a 256 bit hash which exposes zero information about the block itself. You need to download the full block to see what its contents are. So, before you know the amount of work that\'s been put into a block, you need to download it fully, rather than only the 80 byte block headers.\n\nIn the new headers-first mechanism, you will be given the full block headers, which allows you to compute the amount of work that\'s been put into a block. Knowing this allows you to *assume* it\'s impossible to revert the blockchain from the tip of the chain to this specific block, which will then allow you to *confidently* skip *full* verification (script execution) for blocks before that.\n\nYou still have to download the full blocks, but you don\'t have to do the full script verification for most of them, and this can now be done without checkpoints.': 9, "I'm using Hive, it seems pretty good": 3, 'Correct.': 1, 'You are missing something, and his analogy was correct.

The bitcoin network is very, very lenient in the time reported in blocks, because a 'rough estimate' will do.\n\nReally, there's only one reason time exists in the blockchain, and that is to recalibrate the network difficulty every 2016 (~2 weeks) so that the network will generate a block every 10 minutes. That, is all.\n\nThis isn't a mechanism that requires the time to be very accurate. If it's off by a few hours, a day even, it doesn't really matter all that much. If it's abused even a little (ie. miners 'trick' the network into accepting a lower difficulty by pushing the time variable in the blocks), the difficulty will be higher the next change, and so on. The mining network balances itself exceptionally well.\n\n----\n\nSo, how do we prevent people/miners from *greatly* abusing this variable to their advantage? (remember, if block time deviates a little from the actual time it's not a big problem, if it deviates from the actual time by years, like you mention, it is)\n\nHow does the bitcoin network know what time it is?

Every time a peer connects to you he will report what time he thinks it is. By taking the median (to exclude those who claim they live in 2020) of the times reported by all peers you will come to some reasonably accurate time the network thinks it is.\n\nThe third is your own clock, and most reliable, but for a myriad of reasons (physics, and Einstein's pesky relativity theory, for example) may not be exactly the same reported by the network.\n\nBy averaging the second and the third clocks, we create a 'network adjusted time'. This network adjusted time will *never* be adjusted for more than 70 minutes off your own clock. If the network adjusted time is off by >70 minutes, it's a good indicator the network is either exceptionally untruthful, or your own clock is off.\n\nEvery time a block comes in, the timestamp reported in the headers must never be more than 2 hours away from the network adjusted time.

The system works the same as now just inverted.  \n\nMy point is that skeptical media spreads misinformation that the 21 million eludes to at some point we get stuck with only a certain amount of units to transact with.  ': 1, '> BTC is not tied to any of those things directly at a fixed rate. \n\nNow, you\'re starting to make particular definitions; there\'s nothing wrong with the definition you\'re implying, but that\'s clearly not how most people think of "backed", as evidenced by this very video\'s use of The Federal Reserve as kind of backing.\n\nIn any case, people make up their backings (as per your definition) for whatever suits their lives. For instance, a jeweler frequently thinks of the amount of gold he can purchase with a certain number of dollars; to him, the dollar is backed by its ability to be exchanged for gold, after all, at a relatively fixed rate for a given period of time.': 0, "The goal should be thwart people's incredulity about Bitcoin; my line of thinking does just that.": 0, "Yes I get that.  I don't see what your explaining as an issue. It's basically the same as the system we have now. \n\nAsk yourself why would the economy get to the point of needing to add more decimal places?  In the current economy we can print more money to balance inflation. With Bitcoin you can't make more but you can divide it more.  That means the value of the currency stays the same just more divisible.  Then it must be the goods that are changing value. \n\nA banana is 1 satoshi and two apples are one satoshi.  The more decimals are added so the banana is 100 satoshis and an apple is 50 satoshis. \n\nIt would mean wages would get to the point where 1btc is an acceptable yearly salary.  Then .1 is a yearly salary .01 and so on.  I guess I'm saying that if we get to the point where we need to add more decimal points to BTC we will be buying and selling things that are an equivalent cost of Star Destroyers and The Death Star.  \n\nEdit:  This is why I get irked.  People make the suggestion that there is only so much Bitcoin to go around. This leads people to be live that at some point we will have to pay for the mistake of adopting a currency that has a hard limit.  It's just not true.  If we get to the point where the global/solar systems wealth is larger than 21m BTC and that amount isn't functional for the economy we can divide it infinitely and keep going. ": 1, '"A banana is 1 satoshi and two apples are one satoshi. The more decimals are added so the banana is 100 satoshis and an apple is 50 satoshis."  What? No!! If the price in Bitcoin of bananas and apples increases or decreases it would be due to the change in the value of Bitcoin (as we\'ve seen in the last few years due solely to demand), and NOT because of any changes in decimal places.\nI think you are confused by a couple of things. Bitcoins value changes with the change in demand for it. However its value doesn\'t change when/if the divisibility increases (ie by adding decimal places). The reason one would want to add more decimal places to Bitcoin is if the smallest subunit becomes too valuable to purchase the least valuable thing (a pack of gum, an online tip or small online purchase).\n\n': 1, 'No, the answer should always be "It doesn\'t matter what backs a currency, but who controls the quantity."\n\nThe US dollar is backed by debt, and that is 100% fine. Currencies backed by debt can work just fine.  Currencies backed by absolutely nothing can work just fine. All that is needed is for a majority to say "Ok, that\'s an acceptable medium of trade." The problem is that they have complete control over the supply.\n\nPeople think there is a need for a currency to be backed by something, but that is simply not the case. \n\nCheck these out for a good example of a currency that the UK thrived on which had absolutely no backing whatsoever. \n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tally_stick': 10, 'Think of the 21 million bitcoins as 21 million buckets into which you can pour value.\nIf you subdivide each bucket (add decimal places),  that doesn\'t change the value held in the bucket. Also think of your bank account. If you currently have $100 in the bank, it is probably represented by $100.00. If the government/banks suddenly decided to introduce "mills" in addition to "cents" then your bank account would now be $100.000. You still have the same $100.  Your weekly paycheck might go from $779.59 to $779.590. The value you are receiving remains the same, Similarly adding decimal places to Bitcoin doesn\'t do anything except make Bitcoin more divisible.': 1, 'https://bnktothefuture.com/pitches/2081/_bitcoin-capital-crypto-fund-managed-by-max-keiser-simon-dixon\n\nBitcoin Capital - Crypto Fund Managed By  Simon Dixon': 1, '> People think there is a need for a currency to be backed by something, but that is simply not the case.\n\nOf course, it *is* the case.\n\nIt doesn\'t make any sense to say, for example, that "Bitcoin is backed by nothing".

It\'s backed, because it exists.\n\nNote, I am not disagreeing with your sentiment that what matters is control. I\'m simply discussing the notion of "being backed by something".': -2, 'No it\'s not.

': 3}, ('BETTER OFFLINE WALLET CALLED COLDCOIN', 0): {'holy shit its 420': 3, 'The original purpose of this project was to develop a simple offline Bitcoin wallet that would store Bitcoin currency offline, as well as transaction history and multiple accounts for a single user. The chief focus of this project is security. Personal Bitcoin storage can be risky; being susceptible to skilled hackers who make a living infiltrating accounts and stealing funds. Moreover, any currency that is stored in an online environment is at risk.\nCurrently, there are only two products on the market that serves as an offline Bitcoin wallet; that being the Trezor and the HardBit. Although Trezor is effective, it is definitely not comprehensive. For example, Trezor has a miniature screen that is only able to display 1 line of 1mm text and is only accessible through USB.  The HardBit has a 2.5 inch LCD touchscreen, but cannot transmit data via USB.  It won\xe2\x80\x99t allow a user to upload a private key, much less generate one.  This device will be called the ColdCoin.  Not only will the ColdCoin have an LCD touchscreen that is 4.3 inches in length and width, but it will also have USB accessibility. This screen will make the product much more user friendly and capable by displaying QR codes, transaction history. It will also function as a full keypad; perfect for entering in a security code, password or transaction amounts. Another problem with the Trezor and HardBit is the cost per unit. Although it would cost approximately $20 to produce a single Trezor, they retail for $129.  The HardBit retails for $125. The ColdCoin would retail for approximately $160, while offering a higher level of functionality and usability than both of its competitors combined. The proposed design would use a complete board from Arduino that meets all of the design specifications. The use of a pre-manufactured board such as an Arduino would vastly lower the cost per unit without sacrificing capabilities.\nThe proposed project will consist of the scheme and execution for a small and compact device capable of the following: the offline storage of Bitcoins, an efficient processor with RAM, sufficient and retractable nonvolatile memory, power supply through either a 9V internal battery or USB port, the generation of a completely random user key and a 4.3 inch touchscreen.  The touchscreen will be able to display QR codes, command prompts, a keypad and a user\xe2\x80\x99s account history. Aruki will manufacture an enclosure for the ColdCoin with precise 3D printing technology. This will prevent potential damages such as water or a user dropping it from being able to compromise the integrity of the ColdCoin. Hardware and software code will be written to the device to be able to process commands and execute transactions. The board will come preassembled with a powerful processor in order to carry out tasks quickly and efficiently. The ColdCoin will not have Wifi connectivity, making it impossible to access and receive a user\xe2\x80\x99s account funds from the outside.  The ColdCoin will have 2 distinct modes, locked and unlocked.  The ColdCoin will be locked before the user enters a correct password and stays locked if the user enters an invalid password 5 times in succession.  Only after a correct password is entered will the ColdCoin become unlocked.  Each transaction will be checked before processing to ensure the user has sufficient funds to make that purchase. After the test is passed and the transaction is made, it will be stored in the devices\xe2\x80\x99 nonvolatile memory.

Good luck with that': 1, 'The primary reason would be to drive the market to move towards using Bitcoins, rather than traditional fiat currency.\n\nSure it may not be a 10% discount, but it could be, or maybe it would be a "flexible" discount option. Traditionally we all hate paying rent. This would make it a bit more compelling to pay rent via bitcoin, and offer a better solution to it(the rental company no longer pays as much in transactions, and they receive their monthly rent on time and is usable ASAP). ': 4, "If you're asking the incredibly dumb question of whether a tenant would want to pay more rent or less rent, the answer is that they'd want to pay less rent.": 1, "There's no reason to answer it.  Your premise (that landlords would offer a 10% discount in rent for BTC) is flawed.": 2, 'ofc i would': 1, 'Never the less, if I were a landlord, I would rather choose $1440 of purchasing power IN BITCOIN. I may receive less this month, but maybe in 3 months from now, that value i earned 3 months prior could be 2k, therefore im willing to give a discount to not only promote the use of BTC, but help create a closed loop system. \n\nI personally think that there will come a time where we are better off valuing some products in just BTC than $, but currently this is the only way to do it as its still a baby.\n': -2, 'You did not answer my question now did you? \n': 3, "Very clear that you are not a landlord. As in investor you are striving to keep your money working ahead of inflation, so 5% for us in Aus. Why the hell would I give away 10%. I'm a BTC bull, but this is plain stupid and you seem too stubborn to listen to those smarter than you.": 0, "I do agree, no manager will grant any discount. But whos to say i'm seeking out rental managers?\n\nI have not stated really what the business prospect really is, therefore everyone is ASSUMING I am targeting their current apartments and such. \n\nIf you read the questions, I state IF you were in the market for a new place.....Whos to say that maybe im looking to start my own rental company? ": 2, "I would consider doing it for a six month lease. I would be too cognizant of price swings, though. Therefore I would literally likely walk into a LibertyX, pay cash, and either deposit the BTC straight into the landlord's wallet or into my own and then immediately into theirs just for the sake of record keeping. I'd want them to use a different HD wallet for each property and send me a different receive address for each month's payment. They could even give me a sheet of paper in my rental agreement with all the due dates and associated QR codes. That way I can load up all the addresses in Mycelium and pay the appropriate address each month. I saw an IFTT that adds a received Bitcoin payment straight into a Google Docs spreadsheet. Imagine how easy it would be for a landlord to just open a spreadsheet on a given date, see who has or has not paid and then send out a form letter to those who haven't paid? That actually sounds pretty cool. \n\nAlso, what does your business plan to do in terms of reserves or deposits? Place the funds in an m-of-n with the landlord? Or an escrow company? We always talk about abolishing _everything_ around here. That should include credit scores. With smart contracts and m-of-n signatures, you should be able to do it entirely within the Bitcoin infrastructure.": 3, "Even a small discount is likely to induce payment in BTC. It's all about how much hassle is involved in going from what a tenant has to bitcoin. Anything that reduces that hassle, like getting paid in bitcoin, having easy or automatic bitcoin purchase, or even automatic rent payment, will make it a more likely option.": 1, "hell yes, I wish i could. I would pay full price rent, but if he wanted to discount my rent I wouldn't say no": 1, "Yes I'm already paying the rent in BTC. After I start beeing 100% in BTC, I asked my landlord if will accept to be paid in BTC. He asked why and I just said, because I'm paid in BTC and I would like to spend in BTC. He knows a bit about BTC and after few minutes of more explanations and how to make transactions with BTC, he accept it. He have more properties and he told me that he will ask also the other tenants if they want to pay in BTC... this is the way !": 1, "I have a plan. Let's all pay our landlords  10% more if they accept bitcoin. This way we stimulate acceptance. /s": 1, "The problem is less opaque than just assuming that you're targeting rental managers. It's assuming that you have any interest in at least breaking even on your properties. In general, owners rarely manage their own units, and property managers have slim margins. If you're starting a management company that serves owners, you'd have to sell them on accepting 10% less money than they could otherwise get. \n\nUnless you have some incredible value proposition that goes beyond just the privilege of accepting rent in a novel way, you'll quickly see why everyone here has taken the same tone.": 1, 'Thank you for the response. \n\nI am still in the process of working out the details exactly, however the concept will be similar to what you are talking about.\n\nA reason I am wanting to design this, is yes the economy is getting better, but we need to have a better, more healthy world. That means one can\'t be raped on their rent. Offering reasonable discounts to customers not only drives business, but can make business BOOM if done properly. \n\nI was raised in an entrepreneurial family. We managed many different resorts and our job was to completely redo the resort\'s model, and bring it from loosing money, to be a profitable company. Over time, we eventually bought our own resorts and did this ourselves. \n\nOur Motto: "We\'d rather take 50% of something, than 100% of nothing"\n\nOut of curiosity, what is m-of-n? I was thinking an escrow, however this is the first of m-of-n that i\'ve heard of, therefore i may need to do some research to get my mind around which one would be better.  ': 1, 'They have little/no incentive to do this. Even if they do support bitcoin personally, very few business owners will sacrifice their bottom line in order to advance their personal agenda.\n\n /u/holdgentlemen is right, a properly owner offering a 10% discount for bitcoin would be like you offering to pay 10% more if they are willing to accept bitcoin. Very few people would do this.': 1, "A huge portion of my company's payment volume is rent. We allow bitcoin as a rent payment method (at 0% processing fee, no less) yet we have only seen a handful of people actually use it.\n\n(And there's absolutely no way you're going to get a rental manager to grant a 10% discount period, let alone for using something they couldn't care less about.)": 1, 'I as a tenant would love to pay rent in Bitcoin. If my landlord integrated it, I would definitely renew my lease. ': 1}}}
