Right?\n\nSure, it depends on the situation like the receivers abilities to travel and so on...\nAnd also 80$ difference could be a lot (read "enough reasons") in some countries/areas,\nfor many people to even spend a whole day to get the money.\n\nSo, again, assuming the next town (where WU is also) has anyhow access to the internet,\nand there is a local guy (Bob) taking like 2% fees, to convert the coins received into local cash.\n\nThe service from this guy, that obviously already knows how to deal with Bitcoin,\ncould be to create a wallet for every customer (Aunty)\nand send an Address/QR via E-Mail to Joe.\n\nNow, every time Joe has summed up his 1000$, he gives her Aunty a call,\nor they have a planned schedule with fixed days... whatever...\n\nJoe knows, she will be at Bobs place on 1PM \nso he exchanges (instant on Circle, buys them locally or where and how ever he likes to)\nand sends the transaction.\nAunty shows up at Bob around 1PM (remember, same town/effort as with WU),\nBob recognizes the received BTC in Auntys Wallet, calls her up by name and\nAunty receives around 960$ worth of local currency.\nDone.\n\n\nNow, think about:\nWhat exactly does Bob need, to serve as exchanger for the people from the surrounding, rural areas?\nAny kind of computer, a network connection, a place to do the business and a bank account to cash in the received BTC from Joe.\n\nSo, please correct me, but I\'m somehow optimistic that a town with an WU office, also has a way to get access to the Internet in the most cases(?).\nThus the chances, to find someone that you could educate to handle the above, aren\'t that bad, I think.\n\n**How to start or how to find Bob?**\nIf you know about people or communities in your town, that maybe send money home:\ncontact them, ask if you might join them for a while and ask some questions, go there, meet them.\nIdentify the locations they send money to, check out where their relatives pick the money up.\nDo some Google Magic and read up, where the closest Internet access could be. Get back to that people and ask them,\nif they know someone in that area, ideally someone with a computer.\nTry to get his E-Mailaddress, Skype or whatever.... get in contact.\nMaybe someone helps you with translation, if needed.\nAnd also remember, 2% goes to Bob, which could mean "worth a lot of local money" (or read "a very good incentive").\n\nIf you think,.. "wow, a lot of work to do" - yes, that\'s right.\nBut maybe you\'ll want to meet your local community once a week/month,\naccept their money and send the BTC to Bob for a 2% fee?\n\nWhat\'s in for you?\nCalculate: every Sunday, take an hour time, meet them and, for the start, lets say 5 people, each sending 500$ and you take 2%. \nAround 50$ or 0.13 BTC, at the time of writing - sounds not so bad to me :)\n\nI surely miss the one or other point here\n(like your jurisdiction might see this as a taxable event/business...\nmoney transmitting laws, exchange licenses etc.),\nbut in the right circumstances, with the given basics and personal efforts,\nit should be absolutely possible to find and educate "Bob" all over the world. For everyone.\n\nI\'ve never been the guy that sat there, just waiting for things to happen somehow, somewhere...\nThat\'s why I started my own research last week, to find out which foreign communities have their events, meetings etc. in my hometown.\nNext step will be to ask them, if it\'s okay to visit them and if I may ask some questions / try to create awareness on this topic.\n\nI\'ll report back as soon as I have the first feedbacks and results.\n\nEDIT: some formatting :P\n': 2, "1) Worker in USA buys BTC through circle easier than before (credit card) or cheaper than before (bank ACH with zero fee). \n\n2) Recipient in foreign country signs up for BitPay merchant account. \n\n3) Worker sends money to recipient's BitPay account, which then converts to local currency (dozens of currencies supported) instantly with zero fee. \n\n4) Recipient withdraws local currency from BitPay into local bank account.": 2, "they sell the bitcoin to other people, cash.\nthere will always be people in those countries needing bitcoins to do business, or as an investment.

I mean, lets take the African community in my town as example, that I\'d visit every week/month....and they would tell me, that "scammy Bob" did not exchange the sent BTC to Aunty!? A "one timer" for him vs. steady x% income (that is a lot higher than every job he could get around). Because no one would ever trust /use/visit Bob again. Sure, compared to WU this is a risk. But if Bob fails, there will be Jim. He\'ll have hard times to get trust, of course... but... you know where this is going. IF you find Bob, and make sure to explain everything the right way, he will gladly live on that 2% (USD/EUR!!!) and try to keep that income.\nSure, there are many crooks and idiots, everywhere.. but... we\'ve seen this in every business before. So i guess it is all about finding the "right Bob" willing to understand/accept this whole thing.\n\nCircle will help on the one side. But, well... if you\'re in contact with a community that sends money home, it is your decision to teach them how to use exchanges (zero to 0.2 or 0.5 fees) to buy bitcoin, or offer them a service at a (2% ?) markup.\nEDITED': 1, 'Yeah, I think the solution will be slightly different in every country. Most countries seem to have some sort of their own local payment system. Hopefully even if bob is "unbanked" in the most traditional sense, he can become "banked" by using cellphone minutes as currency which he can buy with bitcoin. Cellphone minutes/credit can hopefully become an intermediate link between bitcoin and local fiats.': 2, "The problem isn't sending the bitcoin as remittances, that's easy.

Do you care? Difference is made by the total receiving and the "flexibility" what to change BTC for. If you want to change 1 BTC for 150kg of potatoes - and your exchanger agrees - why not!?\nExchanger (Bob) just has to check if he got the 150kg Potatoes for around -2% (Fee) than he sells it.\nVery simplified, but you know what I mean. Right?': 1, 'I think a key to the answer might be the fact that bob\'s relationship with his "bank" in theory only needs to be 1 directional: selling bitcoin for something to give to aunty (either local currency or cell phone minutes etc).

But establishing all of these "Bob"s is not just a matter of money and infrastructure, but also time. Think about how many scams will pop up. Now I\'m pretty sure there are some terrible scams involving remittance via WU right now, but an entirely new money transmission route like BTC remittance would also be everything that criminal Bobs have been waiting for.\n\nThere are two other points I\'d like to make:\n\n> If you think,.. "wow, a lot of work to do" - yes, that\'s right.\n\nExactly! And that\'s the reason why OP\'s suggestion that Circle should have prime time ads claiming "Goodbye Western Union" is such bullshit.\n\nLast but not least, I feel that people in this sub forget that the bitcoin ecosystem is not the only thing that can adapt to new circumstances. It\'s fairly possible that traditional services like WU would adapt, lower fees, etc if bitcoin became a serious competitor.

Well understood, low cost, absolutely minimal counterparty risk (banks are heavily regulated), no other risks.\n2. You need to rely on a 3rd party who is willing to engage in high-risk Bitcoin derivative trading, thus counterparty risks will be very significant.

Each of them will provide 1 bitcoin as a collateral. (I.e. both will put 1 bitcoin into a multisig 'escrow'.)\n \nNow suppose price drops to $250, this means Alice should pay Bob 1 bitcoin. If it is lower than $250 she should pay more than 1 bitcoin to Bob... But she only provided 1 bitcoin as a collateral.\n\nIf you want to cover bigger price movement, you need bigger collateral.
