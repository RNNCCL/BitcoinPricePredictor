News about a single, small, nascent and growing phenomenon like driverless cars or Nest thermostats. You couldn't do it without the occasional joke and non-academic, non-serious material. That's what reddit is.\n\nAs such, I don't really care. I tend to visit daily and there's loads of good discussion going on. Every now and then something happens and the front page is flooded with that particular topic. Whether it's China, Mt. Gox, Tipping, Lawsky, Ghash.io, a company launch. an important conference, that's just how these communities work. Right now it's a few days of Western Union, not a problem.\n\nIs it deserved? Absolutely. This is a company that's been taking an average of about 10% in fees for decades and decades from the poorest people on the planet. That may work in the 20th century, and it may have been justifiable if nobody was able to do it cheaper, but they're still trying to do this today in 2014 and don't seem to be interested in adapting. In fact, they're resistant to change and aren't even actively exploring better ways to transfer value (like bitcoin), when their entire company is based on transferring value. \n\nSo when a lone individual posts a single harmless little joke comparison, and the WU offices take the time to file a copyright complaint (unjustified based on copyright laws by the way) against a citizen who compares WU to bitcoin in jest, that's pretty pathetic and hilarious. And it's nice to see a community of individuals make fun of that and give WU some perspective.\n\nIt's fully deserved to see the community express their frustration with WU's practices through humor, I really don't see the problem.
