The miners will surely switch if the market price of your coin is more than 240 USD.  Perhaps, if you do a very good marketing campaign, there will be enough ~~fools~~ visionaries that will buy the new coins for 300 USD each.  \n\nAlternatively, you could promise them that you will pay 7500 USD for the reward coins of each block that a miner solves on your blockchain.  It will cost you ~1.1 million dollars per day; if you can get 200 million USD of VC funding, you can keep doing that for six months.\n\nEither way, once you have attracted enough miners to your blockchain, you can rightfully claim that it is better than the Satoshi20090103 one, because it is more secure.

For further reading on that, see Goodhart.\n\nBut the same logic also applies to commodity producers. Note, as an example, comments last week from Glencore CEO Ivan Glasenberg about who really may be to blame for the 40 per cent plus fall in the company\xe2\x80\x99s share price:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnfortunately, our competitors\xe2\x80\x89.\xe2\x80\x89.\xe2\x80\x89.\xe2\x80\x89have produced more supply than demand and commodity prices are down for that reason,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr Glasenberg told shareholders at the company\xe2\x80\x99s annual meeting in a casino in Zug, the low-tax city near Zurich in Switzerland.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not our fault governor! It\xe2\x80\x99s the wider system\xe2\x80\x99s unconstrained supply rate.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBut suppose the rate of production could be algorithmically controlled to make it more difficult to mine commodities, money or financial assets as and when too many entities enter the system? And suppose, on top of that, such a mechanism was dubbed \xe2\x80\x9ctechnology\xe2\x80\x9d instead of a cartel system outright.\n\nWould anti-trust authorities be inclined to look the other way then?\n\nKeep that in mind as we return to the underlying fundamentals that really destabilised the financial system in 2008. Yes, there was unknown risk in the system due to overzealous issuance of subprime securities. Yes, Libor rates began to skyrocket because banks refused to backstop each vis-a-vis their collective liabilities to the central bank. And yes, banks began telling porky pies about the amount of liquidity they really needed in the system.\n\nBut at its heart, we\xe2\x80\x99d argue, the system failed because the cartel mechanism that controls credit issuance \xe2\x80\x94 the central bank \xe2\x80\x94 misread the supply picture to such a degree that there was no way all former members could survive at the new controlled supply rate.\n\nRemember, from the perspective of the central bank, the system should be kept just short enough of liquidity to ensure that demand for central bank-issued money is always high.\n\nAt the same time, however, the central bank knows it must provide the liquidity the system needs for stability to be maintained \xe2\x80\x94 something it\xe2\x80\x99s usually more than happy to do as long as the act of dispersing liquidity doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have price destabilising side-effects.\n\nThis, in reality, is what price stability is all about.\n\nIf and when the central bank\xe2\x80\x99s currency begins to lose purchasing power, the central bank knows it must withhold liquidity until the cartel\xe2\x80\x99s weakest and least scrupulous member is identified and weeded out, or \xe2\x80\x94 alternatively \xe2\x80\x94 fear of cartel collapse makes it too costly for banks to keep creating assets at the rate they had become accosted to.\n\nEither way, the overall result is a contraction in the broad money supply, with complementary cartel-esque price stabilisation effects.\n\nThe eurodollar situation\n\nThe central bank system described above, however, is only as good as the closed nature of the system it operates and the collective interest of the cartel members it supervises to operate within that closed system.\n\nBut herein lies the significance of the shadow banking sector. Shadow banking, by and large, is the means by which a closed controlled system is turned into an open and uncontrolled system.\n\nThis is best illustrated by the rise of the so-called \xe2\x80\x9ceuro\xe2\x80\x9d dollar, pound and euro markets which exist in a hitherto unregulated and parallel capacity to those of the central-bank controlled onshore equivalents.\n\nThis is a problem because once dollars, euros or pounds leak beyond the supervisory scope of the core cartel enforcement agent, and begin to be intermediated, re-lent and cleared by less stringent cartel organisations on the sidelines, the stability of the domestic controlled system \xe2\x80\x94 including the implied value of the unit of account \xe2\x80\x94 become threatened.\n\nThe systems, effectively, end up facing their own version of the Ivan Glassenberg problem. So don\xe2\x80\x99t blame the Fed, in other words, because those who clear dollar lookalike securities outside of the Fed\xe2\x80\x99s control can\xe2\x80\x99t be trusted to do the job reliably.\n\nSince the crisis, it has as a result become de rigueur to clear all dollar-denominated transactions through New York. But this has exposed the world to the reality that every dollar denominated transaction is de facto subject to US foreign policy or government intervention. As Dan Davies notes with respect to the business of banks like Deutsche Bank, that does not play well with those entities that want to supervise dollar assets without having US policy enforced on them extraterritorially.\n\nBut as Davies notes, for a dollar clearing arrangement outside the USA to retain trust and operate without the need of a US central bank guarantee, it would need an extremely disciplined cartel mechanism to self-control supply (mainly because going cap in hand to the Fed for missing liquidity is unlikely to be an option again).\n\nSmall surprise then that many banks think the shared ledger \xe2\x80\x9ctechnology\xe2\x80\x9d of blockchain could be such an opportunity for the clearing of the eurodollar markets.\n\nSmall surprise, also, that central banks are investigating if the \xe2\x80\x9ctechnology\xe2\x80\x9d could provide a better and cheaper means for policing the existing bank system \xe2\x80\x94 which still doesn\xe2\x80\x99t fully trust each other \xe2\x80\x94 than defaulting to a fully centralised full-reserve system like that being proposed in Iceland.': 4, "She has interesting points here and there but is clearly narrowing her viewpoint through an obvious negative bias which permeates entirely throughout every single one of her articles which is unfortunate.

(pause) Is there some way we can trade dollars around, even though we don\'t trust each other, and settle up accounts, without having to go through the New York Fed?"\n\n(Keeping dollars outside the US is what a "euro" dollar is.)\n\nBanks are busy lending each other "euro" dollars but aren\'t able to settle accounts out very well without going through the real Fed, like the NY Fed.  They hate that.  The NY Fed might keep their money or at least intervene sometimes as a matter of foreign policy when deciding who gets to settle up with whom.\n\nThe problem is bad enough that they are mulling the idea of a full-reserve bank, located in Ireland, to hold dollars just to settle up accounts.\n\nProblem is (and the reason it would have to be full-reserve) is that none of these banks trust each other. "Maybe," they think, "can we use the blockchain to track assets like "euro" dollars and trade those tokens around?"\n\nThe international banking cartel is more likely to try to settle international accounts on the blockchain than to have a full-reserve "euro" dollar denominated centralized bank located in Ireland ;) -- and it is a banking cartel, because it\'s membership is limited and as a cartel they effect price controls -- they set the price of money.\n\nAlso, these "euro" dollars are messing up the value of actual dollars. The unit of account purpose of money is getting all messed up and becoming more and more outside the Fed\'s control. \n\n("Welcome to my parlor" said the spider to the fly.)\n\n': 1, "> Small surprise\n\nSmall surprise Izabella?  c'mon, you are flabbergasted.": 2}, ('Marc Andreessen is interviewed by Tad Friend from the New Yorker on how the future may look.', 26): {'https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1952216595/15548_alienGenitalia_conehead_l1_400x400.jpg': 1, 'I need Summary bot :(\n': 3, 'Also [this](http://i.imgur.com/qhshJP5.jpg) and [this](http://i.imgur.com/cG14LKz.png).

What makes "the" blockchain more infallible is the fact that it is not controlled by a few, but a number so high, that it is practically impossible to corral enough users to actually change the chain.  That\'s infallibility.  A meddle proof ledger.  If the banks create some exclusive blockchain they have nothing but but a copy of quickbooks.  What\'s the point?  This fixes nothing.

If it\'s your own, then just set up a centralized server and save yourself the trouble.  If you\'re going to run a service on a blockchain, the only reason to do it is because it\'s secured from being arbitrarily changed by human intervention.  It\'s only secure because a fuckton of computing power has been dedicated to maintaining that blockchain by a bunch of decentralized strangers who are seeking an independent reward for providing the computing power.\n\nSo again, what other blockchain could Nasdaq be planning to run on that satisfies the necessary prerequisite of being maintained in a highly secure and decentralized manner?\n\nTo set this bullshit straight, a blockchain is not valuable unless the currency that is provided as a reward for its maintenance has value.  While Bitcoin is able to exist because of blockchain technology, "the blockchain" has no value without Bitcoin itself having value.  Nonetheless, Bitcoin would lose its value almost instantly if ever "the blockchain" lost its decentralized security.\n\nAccordingly, if Nasdaq is planning to run on a blockchain, it has to be a secure one.  Otherwise, someone will dump a little hash power on the system and fuck them up.  On the other hand, Nasdaq could create a closed system, but if someone can\'t dump hash power, then it\'s just another centralized server masquerading as a blockchain, which provides no extra value, and is useless beyond measure, compared to a central server that can do the same thing faster and better.\n\nI guess Nasdaq could decide to create an altcoin (compete with Bitcoin), and push it until it has enough value an hash power to securely support their service.  But why?  The odds of success for that coin are very low, and next to nothing if they premined.  Therefore, without the premine, all they would have created is another Bitcoin, which they have no vested interest in.  In several years, with a lot of luck, this theoretical coin would allow them to do the exact same thing they could have already done with Bitcoin\'s blockchain right now.\n\nTL;DR they have to be planning to use the Bitcoin Blockchain.': 29, '[Colored Coins](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Colored_Coins) is a protocol which allows the assign of alternative meaning (other then balance) to a bitcoin address.

If you sell a stock on eTrade today, it takes 3 fucking days to get your money.  What they're proposing here will drop it to less than 1 day.  Why does it take so long?  Because someone who isn't an idiot needs to look through these transactions and manually give them a seal of approval.\n* Keep in mind that one trade would not be one transaction on the block chain.

In addition, they may maintain their own copy of the blockchain in order to do lookups down the road.
