Just the same way Saudi Arabia pushes the (more expensive to extract) Shale Oil from USA out of the market at prices under 80$ per barrel.\n\nAnd it\'s working.

This theoretical value also makes the unspoken assumption that Bitcoin will eventually push out all other currency options. While that could happen, it's a rosy, dreamy assumption, to say the least.\n\nIf you want to buy something, the chances the other party will accept Bitcoin are similar to randomly throwing a rock in the air blindfolded and happening to clip a passing bird. Sure, the number of people using it are growing, but I honestly don't see much pressure for this to become as ubiquitous as fiat systems currently are.\n\nIt's a Catch-22. Bitcoin would have incredible monetary value if it were more widely accepted. But it only has a chance of becoming widely accepted if it first becomes more valuable from a utilization standpoint.

Pretty much none.\n\nI suspect this increase in value (value of utility I mean, not just numerical value) will eventually come, once Bitcoin systems are developed to make interacting with the network just as smooth and simple as people can work with fiat today. If Bitcoin-related systems can't reach a point where people just swipe a card and punch in a PIN, it has pretty much zilch chance of approaching even the most conservative estimate of value.\n\n**tl;dr:** An asset's value is partially based upon its ease of use.

I am not too sure how the mining of sidechains would work.\n\nBut the other centralized attack I can think of would be by the main developers of Bitcoin.  What if they got pressured and implemented things into the Bitcoin protocol that Libertarians or others didn't like? Instead of a fork which could really hurt the network, we could simply move to a sidechain instead, while preserving our bitcoin value. You could always move back to the main chain at any time, meaning the sidechain coins would have a minimum value of the bitcoin on the main chain.  Would sidechains protect against this type of centralized attack?  Or they still offer no benefit? \n\nMaybe stupid questions.  Sidechains on the surface seem to me to be incredibly important, trying to understand if I am overestimating their importace or not.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n": 1, 'i say we put a full node on the moon, mars, and neptune.': 1, 'Wit22 600 bits /u/changetip\nThx for that.

Andreas Antonopoulos goes into the importance of sidechains.  You are correct with what you said about the beauty of the distributed system.  But sidechains take this decentralization and bring it to a whole new level.  It can protect Bitcoin from attacks from governments or centralization.  This is the "insurance" the OP is mentioning.  It can allow unlimited innovation.  You could have sidechains where you transform your bitcoin into a sidechain coin that has new features like anonymity, faster confirmations, micro transactions etc. (Also with a 2-way peg you can transform back into Bitcoin any time). If anyone tried to mess with Bitcion, it would give us an exit strategy that allows us to maintain the value of our Bitcoins while entering a sidechain.  The implications of this are very important for the future of Bitcoin and Freedom.  It would create a lot more confidence in the Bitcoin infrastructure, because it would make it much more robust against any kind of centralized attack.\n\nEdit: added about 2-way peg': 1, "I think you may be misunderstanding what sidechains do.

At current usage levels there are many more nodes than are needed, and while adoption of light and other wallets is currently at least stalling node growth if not still reducing node numbers, any serious merchant or company accepting Bitcoin will likely run one or more nodes in due course. Users may also choose to start using full-node capable wallets again in the future as headers first and prunable outputs get merged. If Bitcoin continues to grow as it has in the past, any new spike will probably bring a burst of new numbers of nodes as well.  \n\nSince you're apparently interested in running full nodes, if you're not already aware of it, keep an eye on [Conformal's alternative node implementation btcd](https://github.com/conformal/btcd).
