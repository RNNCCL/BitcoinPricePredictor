Any transaction, whether of legitimate value or classed as spam, is just data. The network passes this data (the transactions) around and marks as valid ones which conform to all protocol rules.

This exactly happened with a company called eGold. When there is a central entity the government knows where to look, where to apply pressure, where to seize and confiscate.

This clearinghouse would receive transactoin data over its bandwidth and update its single database. That allows for *very* high capacity limits.\n\nThe reason Bitcoin doesn't do that is because that's not decentralized.

The price of that outcome then reflects the probability of that policy being effective: "if Bob is elected, there is a 30% chance that unemployment will drop by >1%. However, if Sally is elected, there is a 50% chance that unemployment will drop by >1%" , which informs voters as to the merit of those campaign promises prior to the election.

Instead of governments controlling markets through inane policies, prediction markets will start influencing policy on a global scale. \n\nThere are a lot of other applications Paul has talked about, but something I\'ve been puzzling over is the possibility of having PMs for everything, especially prices.

As a result, big banks and other card issuers agreed to give Apple 0.15% of the value of each credit-card transaction. For bank debit cards, Apple collects a half-cent per purchase, according to people familiar with the service.\n\n\nGoogle isn\xe2\x80\x99t getting transaction fees from bank issuers, said people familiar with the situation. That is because Visa Inc. and MasterCard Inc., which operate the dominant payment networks, recently standardized their \xe2\x80\x9ctokenization\xe2\x80\x9d card-security service and made it free, preventing payments services from charging fees to issuers.\n\nTokenization swaps cardholder data such as account numbers with a unique set of numbers that validates a customer\xe2\x80\x99s identity. Merchants never get the actual card data, eliminating one avenue for online data theft.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is one agreement with Visa and the banks can have confidence that there are no pass-through fees,\xe2\x80\x9d said Visa President Ryan McInerney in an interview. Banks and payment services can make other deals including fees, such as marketing arrangements, according to a person familiar with the matter.\n\nVisa unveiled its new tokenization service on May 28 the same day that Google announced Android Pay and said it had signed on to Visa\xe2\x80\x99s service. Others will likely follow, because of the combined influence of Visa and MasterCard.\n\nThe rules may prompt changes in Apple\xe2\x80\x99s agreements with banks. Some bank executives said they are unhappy with sharing fees and may use Google\xe2\x80\x99s no-fee arrangement to try to persuade Apple to alter its deals. One possible leverage point: As Apple Pay expands outside the U.S., Apple may need to negotiate terms again. The bank executives didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to be identified.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is a bold move on behalf of the banks,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rick Oglesby, head of research at Double Diamond Payments Research. After agreeing to Apple\xe2\x80\x99s terms for Apple Pay, \xe2\x80\x9cthey\xe2\x80\x99re now taking a stand against similar deals. It could easily turn into a standoff.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nMany of Apple\xe2\x80\x99s contracts are for three years, and have roughly two years to go, according to people familiar with the situation.\n\nThomas Noyes, a payment industry consultant, wrote in a recent blog that he expected Apple\xe2\x80\x99s deals with issuers to \xe2\x80\x9csunset quickly\xe2\x80\x9d in the U.S. and not expand outside the country.\n\nApple declined to say if the new rules would affect its deals with issuers in the future.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98This is a bold move on behalf of the banks.\xe2\x80\x99\n\xe2\x80\x94Rick Oglesby, Double Diamond Payments Research\nThe new rules are a blow to Google, which had been negotiating with large banks to get the same deal as Apple, people familiar with the situation said.\n\nMr. Noyes wrote on Thursday that Google may be trying to convert its deals with issuers into marketing agreements where banks pay Google for the right to use its logos or agree to promote the service.\n\nGoogle wants Android Pay to grow in the U.S. and globally much faster than competing mobile payments services, according to a person familiar with the service.\n\nLonger-term, the changes may hurt Google less than it first appears. Without fees, more card issuers may join Android Pay. Standardizing the rules will help mobile-payments grow, said Ed McLaughlin, chief emerging payments officer at MasterCard.\n\nMoreover, Google plans to offer coupons, rewards and loyalty programs to consumers through Android Pay in partnership with issuers and retailers. If those initiatives succeed, they could generate more revenue than a cut of transaction fees, said Richard Crone, a payments-industry consultant. He estimated that an enrolled mobile-payments user is worth more than $300 a year to companies such as Google, mostly from advertising and other marketing programs.\n\nThe rules also will affect a planned payments service from Samsung Electronics Co., which will use Visa and MasterCard\xe2\x80\x99s tokenization standard, according to an executive at a leading card issuer who didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to be identified.\n\nSamsung executive Injong Rhee told analysts recently that Samsung Pay is being developed to drive sales of the company\xe2\x80\x99s high-end smartphones, and not as a major revenue-making opportunity.\n\nA Samsung spokeswoman declined to comment.\n\n\xe2\x80\x94Daisuke Wakabayashi contributed to this article.': 1, 'So they are now promoting Bitcoin?': 1}, ('Have you ever bet here?

In other words, you set an upper limit to the balance of your account at a gateway. This doesn't so much give you any rights, it serves to manage your exposure. You can set the limit as high as you want, though it's important to be careful as all this is debt-based.\n\nWith the Lightning Network, a payment provider would need to temporarily block an amount of Bitcoin to enable him to make future payments to you. This would again put an upper limit on your balance, but this time it actually costs the payment provider money (interest), so he'll charge a price for the service.

Because your gift card is actually (time-locked) bitcoin under the hood, PG&E doesn\'t really care that it\'s "Starbucks dollars".\n\nNo one gets hit with the bitcoin transaction fee until they close out their payment channel.  Thus, PG&E could actually receive thousands of SGCP transactions via their Starbucks Gift Card partner channel while it\'s open, then pay just a single bitcoin transaction fee when it\'s time to close it out and broadcast it to the network.\n\nThe beauty of LN is they make this happen in a trustless manner -- you don\'t need to trust Starbucks Gift Card Processor because the core idea behind a payment channel is the worst thing that can happen is your funds are locked (but not spendable) for 30 days (or whatever time period you negotiate).

And I\'m sure it is already happening.  All this does is add a couple of features to make such systems zero-trust.\n\nSecondly, this is not an "either/or" proposition.  Lightning Network is something that can complement Bitcoin, without necessarily taking anything away from the existing system.\n\nThen there is the fundamental issue of centralization versus scaling of Bitcoin, by itself.  It\'s questionable whether Bitcoin can succeed as an actual currency without radical scaling methods that are guaranteed to add at least some type of centralization.  If Bitcoin doesn\'t succeed as an actual currency, there is not much reason to believe that it will succeed otherwise, as a kind of underground medium of exchange that is not accepted anywhere, not backed by anything, and having little intrinsic value.\n\nSo, then the question becomes "what are you willing to sacrifice, in order to produce a forced flat node structure?"  (I won\'t call it a level playing field, since I don\'t think that\'s what you\'re describing.)  Because if you\'re willing to sacrifice decentralization, by increasing block size to the point that nodes can only be run in datacenters by dedicated organizations, then we\'re back to square one.  I mean, there are other things that can be sacrificed, if you prefer.  But the only one that Satoshi endorsed in the long run was sacrificing decentralization.  As far as I\'m concerned, tree-chains would sacrifice the coin limit.  Sidechains would sacrifice fungibility.  Obviously there are ways to sacrifice trust, which is what we have in third-party services operating already.  Or we can just continue to sacrifice scalability by keeping a block size limit and adding no alternatives, as we have so far.\n\n>Anyone can be a bank, but it\'s no good setting up your own bank if the other banks won\'t let you into their network.\n\nThen start your own network.
