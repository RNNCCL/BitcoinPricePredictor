Keep that offline, on paper, and safe. Anyone that has access to this seed has access to your bitcoins, so it is imperative you keep that safe and secure. You may also be optioned to encrypt your wallet with a password or PIN. \n\nIn addition, you can also create nLockTime transactions periodically. [This is what we do at SuredBits](https://www.suredbits.com). These are transactions that are created and signed but won\'t broadcast to the network, or become valid in other words, until some future point in time. If for whatever reason you completely lose access to your bitcoins, a signed nLockTime transaction is very advantageous to have. Besides the flexibility of invaliding an nLockTime transaction whenever you want, the beauty of these transactions is that they will execute even if you don\'t have access to your wallet at the time of validation. This effectively allows the user to "retrieve" bitcoins that were previously inaccessible. \n\nFeel free to PM me with any questions.': 3}, ("Why I Had to Buy My Wife's Inhaler on the Dark Web [Vice]", 1215): {"The crime isn't that companies have the freedom to charge different rates in different markets, it's the laws that prevent free markets from arbitrage.": 183}, ('What happened to the Bitcoin ATM that was at Hacker Dojo?', 2): {"I would find one useful but if the UX is so bad that I can't practically use it, that's no good.

I have posted some simple [pre-alpha prototype code](https://github.com/ElementsProject/lightning) on GitHub, and started a [development mailing list](http://lists.linuxfoundation.org/mailman/listinfo/lightning-dev).\n\nAs to progress, there are these main technical parts to LN:\n\n1. Generalized channels, which allow arbitrary exchange between two nodes.  This needs a description of what transactions are involved, what the state machine is for all possible combinations, a network protocol between two nodes, and some code to actually implement and test it.\n2. Hashed Time Locked Contracts.  Again, this requires a detailed description of the transactions involved, a state machine for all possible combinations, a network protocol between nodes, and some code to actually implement and test it.\n3. Routing, fees and node location.  This requires a routing protocol, a network protocol to express it, and some demonstration code.  It also requires a separate protocol (DHT?) to find nodes initially to connect to.\n4. Modifications to bitcoin to allow LN to work.\n\nNow, the paper gave us the following parts:\n\n1. A description of what transactions are involved in a generalized channel.\n2. A description of what transactions are involved in an HTLC.\n3. Nothing detailed on routing, fees, or node location.\n4. Suggested modifications (a new CHECKSIG operator with new sighash modes) to allow LN to work.\n\nAnd here's what's happened since then:\n\n1. Simplified the generalized channel protocol, and produced a pre-alpha network protocol and some demonstration code for generalized channels (which works on the Elements Alpha sidechain which has the features LN needs already).  More recently, proposed a change to channel establishment (see 4).\n\n2. Posted a proposed simplification of HTLCs to the list.\n\n3. Started a planning discussion on routing, fees, etc. with the author of Amiko Pay on the list, as well as Joseph Poon.\n\n4. With the proposed modifications (assuming they pass review!), reduced the requirements for bitcoin to BIP62 (malleability), BIP65 (OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY), BIP68 (sequence numbers) and OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY (no BIP yet assigned, needs BIP68).\n\nIt's painful to change design after prototype coding has already begun, but it's worth it if we can avoid a new CHECKSIG op (which has so many possible benefits that it's likely to take years to get right).\n\n> * who's working on it besides blockstream?\n\nAs far as I know I'm the only one full time, which makes sense for this early stage.  Once we have a prototype and a protocol, it makes more sense for others to start coding.\n\nOh, and it goes without saying that I'm not providing an ETA.

If this was a grade 10 kid\'s work I\'d say you knocked it out of the park. If you were handing this in as a fourth year finance student\'s final project, I\'d say you didn\'t pass. I\'m not trying to be a dick, but I\'ve graded students\' work in university courses, and if you\'re working at a higher level, you need to bring a wider breadth of information than you did. \n\nIt\'s good, but you missed some pertinent information that I would say is central to the concept of bitcoin. Let me elaborate... \n\n- Good intro. With you on page 1. \n\n- I like the email analogy, although to techno-phobes the ways in which bitcoin is *not* like email would confuse some people. For example, every email is not on everyone else\'s \'email ledger\'. In the sense that they\'re both protocols, sure. They both involve a client, and sending of discrete information to other people, sure. But you can relatively easily spoof an email - that parallel is not one you\'d want to erroneously paint about bitcoin. \n\n- You capitalize frequently when you don\'t need to - e.g. on slide 4. \n\n- Stylistically, some of your headers and bullet points are phrased in a way I wouldn\'t encourage - e.g. on the "I can mine bitcoins?" page. On that same page, you missed an apostrophe in "computers" with respect to its processing power. You could mention more explicitly what the computers are doing with their processing power. \n\n- I like the Advantages to Bitcoin slide, although I noticed by that point you hadn\'t mentioned the blockchain at all yet and that\'s a key thing about bitcoin that makes it unique. Maybe you need another slide about ideas that others have bandied around about possible additional layers on top of the bitcoin blockchain - mention Nasdaq\'s work, Mastercoin, etc? \n\n- Up to this point you also haven\'t mentioned that it\'s not backed by a government and is relatively decentralized. By the end, you still haven\'t mentioned that. \n\n- You also haven\'t mentioned the built in scarcity or the fact that the rate of new coin generation is a known factor with mining and block rewards. You do mention mining, I should say, but the details are a bit weak, even for an introductory presentation. Could be clearer there - for example, I know bitcoin so I know what you mean, but "once a goal has been reached a payment will be given out" is not informative. Are you talking about personal goals? Do I need to do 12 burpees and I\'ll get 100 bitcoins? That\'s where a slide about the blockchain before the mining section would have been helpful... again, talking about benefits from an immutable decentralized ledger would have been good to mention. \n\n- On the slide after that, I\'d suggest that you don\'t really mean "degree of acceptance" specifically when you\'re really talking about awareness in general, or perhaps skepticism about the technology... You might have early on talked about the core traits of currency (fungibility, transferability, divisibility, etc.) and said that bitcoin isn\'t a terribly amazing store of value (well, it would be if you bought in pre-2013, but you get that volatility is somewhat counter to some notion of reliability or security of the continued relative value of your investment - alas, I don\'t want to go off to far from topic and I\'m not personally convinced at all that it is *not* a good store of value - 95% of my own "savings" are in bitcoin).  \n\n- You mention active development as a disadvantage; perhaps you should have a third slide about other characteristics that are both disadvantageous and advantageous. I\'d suggest that active developers are a positive characteristic (vs. other alts with no full time developers at all). I\'d also suggest that it\'s open to the community to discuss, propose, debate, and contribute to the future development of the currency. That\'s some kind of direct democracy, although not all persons can contribute equivalently, the possibility for access is there, unlike with the current system of fiat we\'re using where we don\'t even get to know which banks are \'shareholders\' for the private Federal Reserve. The core is being revised many times a day and week - and done so in a relatively visible way. That is not an unsubstantial piece of information. \n\n- You\'ve got some unnecessary bullets - and the Legal Standing bullet, as you\'ve pointed out, might be on a \'not sure if good/bad\' page. Although I would also suggest that it\'s a stretch to say that something being outlawed-in-and-of-itself is a benefit. \n\n- Your history slide should be at the beginning. Noting that - why not a "future directions" slide illustrating some longer-term possibilities? \n\n- If you\'re doing a timeline format, there are better ways to visualize that. \n\n- Other cryptocurrencies - like e-gold? I admit I know almost nothing about cryptocurrencies before bitcoin, but if you\'re going to mention them, at least name one. What\'s the difference? This actually also brings up a point that you could define the term cryptocurrency better, earlier in the presentation. \n\n- Might say "other cryptocurrencies began to emerge, such as Litecoin". \n* Unnecessary comma under the "in 2013" header. List the "many mainstream websites" - Dell, Overstock, Newegg, Tiger Direct, etc. \n\n- Why show just a year\'s worth of market spot price? Or, show that, then show the 5 year chart. "The price has fallen since the all-time-high several years ago, but the overall trajectory has been up for 5 years..." \n\n- You also could have mentioned things people are doing with bitcoin - for the unbanked, for remittance, facilitating smart contracts, coloured coins, DACs, and so forth. \n\n- That blue block people have mentioned could have page numbers. \n\nAgain, no offence intended from any of this feedback. I acknowledge that I\'m critiquing your work but haven\'t made a presentation of my own - that I\'m sure others would also critique. See it as hopefully helpful criticism that you could do a significant revision or two to this presentation and you\'d be in a good position to distribute the thing. Do a James D\'Angelo and make a YouTube channel if you don\'t have one already. And again, in response to the "no one is impressed by anything you do in college" is a comment that begs for specific critique because, sadly, in my opinion, this is not college-level work.

I'm willing to bet that you don't.\n": -1, 'OK, let\'s go a bit deeper into the theory of it.\n\nConsider a (crypto)currency which has a notion of flows as first class objects as well as regular coins and allows free conversion between the two. That is if you receive a flow and do not redirect it, it materializes in form of coins which you can spend.\n\nIn that case yes, the only advantage of flows is frequency, that is, in a way, it can improve scalability, as you can set up flow just once and it can exist for years. So you won\'t need to send regular transactions.\n\nHowever, an interesting thing happens if we add [demurrage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demurrage_(currency\\)) a la Freicoin: money which sits in a wallet slowly disappears (is sent to miners, basically). This changes economic properties of money: people get an incentive to spend money ASAP, or lend it: lending at 0% is better than keeping it in a wallet. As Feicoin people say it, it is free of the basic interest.\n\nNow if it also has flows, there is an incentive to use them: if money is sent via flows, it is not lost due to demurrage. With an increased demurrage rate, this incentive becomes higher and higher, and economic properties change even further, it becomes like a hot potato where if you can\'t spend it or pay forward you\'re just losing it.\n\nAnd if demurrage rate is infinite, we get a pure flow money, which doesn\'t exist in a standalone form. If you receive a flow of 100 u/s, but declare outgoing flows for only 90 u/s, 10 u/s gets lost.\n\nSo a hybrid system which allows both flow and transactional money has same benefits as a system which allows micropayments, but pure flow money is something very different.\n\nSimilar structures already exist. E.g. PageRank. Site\'s PageRank depends on number of links pointing to it weighted by their PageRank. Having high PageRank is beneficial as it results in a bigger stream of visitors, which can be monetized. But it\'s not something you can store or somehow convert to PageRankCoin. (You can however sell a site with high PageRank for money.) \n\nSame thing with visitor traffic: it is something valuable, when your site gets visitors you can either try to convert them (to buy your product) or monetize them by sending them to other sites (ads). But you cannot just store visitors.\n\nThe core idea of PageRank is this: you have relationship of form "A endorses B", some a priori ranks and a weighting function, and using that you can compute rank for every node. In case of PageRank itself, it is implied that a link from site A to some B implies that a webmaster of site A thinks that site B might have useful information, thus it is sort of an endorsement. This can be applied to any other kind of relationship, say, vertices can be people instead of sites, and it can be "A likes B" relationship, then we get something like a popularity rank.\n\nNow going back to cryptocurrencies, "A directs flow to B" can be interpreted as "A endorses B", and so we can expect some PageRank-ish properties. Particularly, if we liken naive karma systems like that on reddit to primitive pre-Google search engines, a more advanced flow-money based karma can be more useful and might supplant tipping, for example. \n\nWhen you tip somebody you permanently lose something you own, but when you \'endorse\' him you don\'t, it doesn\'t cost you anything, but is potentially valuable to the receiving party. Likewise, adding a link from your web page to external website doesn\'t cost you anything, but is potentially valuable to that external web site as it increases rank and number of visitors. So again, there is a clear distinction between flow money and normal transactional money, regardless of payment frequency/microtransaction possibilities.': -2, 'I like this idea.

All the HTTP protocol does is allow two computers to talk to each other. If I told you about it in it's early days, it would be hard for you to understand why that would eventually go on to allow things like email to exist. Why that would allow sites like ebay, amazon, facebook, youtube, skype etc to exist in the future. \n\nAll bitcoin is, in it's essence, is to allow anyone to make entries into an immutable ledger with global consensus. One application of that is that we can have a near-instant, decentralized digital currency that is infinitely divisible.  Despite whatever flaws you can see with it, that is revolutionary technology, and most of the things we see coming from it today are quite primitive in comparison to what we'll probably see in years to come... It's hard to predict what the amazons, ebays and facebooks of bitcoin are going to look like. \n\nI predict before we see any of that though, we are going to see the on and off-ramps into and out of bitcoin from fiat currency get easier. Services like Coinbase and Circle are helping but many countries still don't have easy on and off ramps. \n\n**Rebittance**; I predict one of the early uses of bitcoin to begin with though will be 'rebittance' when someone (and you could argue we're already seeing this with Bitpesa and rebit) figures out a near seamless way to transmit money between countries using bitcoin. \n\n**Bitcoin as the Patreon/crowdfunding killer.** I would hope one day bitcoin (or platforms built on bitcoin) is used to fund people directly instead of having to go through middle men. \n\n**Bitcoin as the ultimate offshore bank account and capital flight machine.** If one day, bitcoin wasn't so bubbly and had a more or less consistent rise in value over time, I could see it being a tax haven of sorts. Is your country looking like it might go tits up? Convert your fiat to bitcoin and maybe send it to any number of exchanges where it can near-instantly converted to a more stable fiat currency. Or, keep it in a cryptographically secure address that you can carry out of the country completely in your own memory, that can't be detected by sniffer dogs at the airport, that theoretically can't even be provably linked to you. If enough of your country's populace start doing it, maybe your local shops would prefer to be paid in bitcoin? Even with BTC's horrific loss of value over the last 18 month long bear winter, you would still have outperformed currencies like the venezuelan peso. Even better; while your government is spending all its time and tax dollars on stopping boats loaded with physical money entering the country, they are more or less powerless to stop bitcoin unless they shut down the internet or worse.\n\nWhat's really interesting about this scenario is that we really haven't seen what happens to bitcoin during a currency collapse when there's incentive to get your assets out of a failed economy... at least yet. Bitcoin has never been around during a global recession. But we have seen what happens when there are hints of a failed economy, i.e. Cyprus, and Greece, and almost invariably bitcoin's value went up during these periods. \n\n**Bitcoin stock market** imagine if a company does an IPO over bitcoin using colored coins... anyone in the world with access to bitcoin could take part and help them raise capital. People living in countries with few investment opportunities could buy a fraction of a share in a company and build a portfolio that would otherwise be unavailable to them  simply because of the country they were born in. This also means that companies that would otherwise not exist might now find capital because they can be funded by anyone in the world.

They'd take some resources ($) and time, but would boost exposure and business at the same time.": 2, 'Some groundwork has been laid already...  I think there are two or three completely different demographics to be targeting though...  \n\n1) Students, and Adults under 35ish --  They understand technology, grew up with Google, MP3 and digital photography..   To them, it\'s a natural fit... they are not as conservative as business or older generations, and have the disposible income.    Target items would be gurilla marketing, bumper sticks and such...  Areas would be places of education, malls etc..  Clubs could furnish speakers for meetups to the other demographics.\n \n2) Adults in Business &/or Corporate Settings..  Serious money and potential to help them in business and travel situations.    To get their attention, it has to be all about saving them money and adding convenience.     Corporate gas cards, business travel, anything billed ongoing to a visa card in large dollars..    They need a 30 second pitch that says "I can save you serious business costs by channeling your costs over this direction...".     It means more than hand holding...   It means partnering with resource partners and bitpay to streamline their needs, doing all the legwork to make it seamless as well ..    The business just need to know results... The end result is they talk to other people.  "This bitcoin thing.. is saving us money.. not sure how, but it is... call these guys.."\n\n3) Merchants and vendors -  Business adoption...     This third group is where you would fit \'Backpage\' clients, as well as small businesses.     Small business needs an edge to survive over the Walmarts of the world.    They need places that they can buy supplies with the BTC they receive, and somehow at a discount... this will drive them to use and adopt..  and it\'s our job as a community to spend our BTC with them as loyal customers, even if it means costing a bit more to us...   \n \nExamples here would vary depending on community, but it becomes a grass roots thing.   Can that coffee shop buy supplies or advertising in BTC, and can you frequent that coffee shop often?     Can you insert BTC into the economy on both sides.. for example --  The University book store that accepts BTC from the students to buy books?    - The students use it, the university book store accepts it, and although a closed economy..its big enough to drive adoption.\n\nThere are lots of ways that BTC can benefit organizations, but not without us helping drive it.\n\n': 2, "To be honest, although grass-roots adoption is great, if they don't have somewhere to use it, and a reason to use it, then it is a lost cause.\n \nCase in point:  If a local bitcoin seller hung out at starbucks and offered to fill people's gift cards for 10% off, the average consumer won't care, as a $25 fill would only save them $2.50..   ie: Buy 10 get one free type savings.     \n\n20% - the fold app.. will definitely get their attention... you donate your time for free in education, but it might stick if they have a source of bitcoins.. which kind of nullifys the entire idea.\n\nHowever:   Talking to a few managers in the Starbucks down in the city core, and finding out that they Cater to local office towers... then you have a business case.     Those clients buy larger quantities, and the savings matter to the one person who has to orchestrate it for the office...  savings enough they may buy/use bitcoin.\n\n": 2, 'Awesome!  I think no matter, there is resources required, time for sure, but eventually somehow tangibly putting Bitcoin in peoples hands, but eventually a few bucks.  \n  \nWithout any capital off the top of my head, Kijiji, craiglist, backpage,  r/calgary, perhaps a few local bloggers, vlogs, maybe a partnership or co promotion with a local magazine or Metro, local press release, free bullition boards at schools & surrounding businesses ....... but I think a big thing would be having one of these nights dedicated to educating vendors on the benefits of accepting it.     \n\n  \nSince the ATM is in the Cafe, and so are the meetings, seems like a good starting point for canvasing around other small business within the area to come out to the vendor night.  I like getting vendors on board, because they have the ability to generate lots of traffic and can all extend to a different demographic at once, for a low cost.    \n    \n   \nI think once the word get a little traction in Calgary it would be good to get the ATM owners, and small businesses around town accepting Bitcoin to consider financial assistance (all with projected investment / benefit of course) directly handed out promotional material (bitcoin focused, shares ATM locations, and where Bitcoin is useable in Calgary, meetup dates etc. a community guide basically)  promotional flyers / brochures etc..... There\'s always going to be the "didn\'t it crash" "isn\'t it used for bad things", so a person to speak directly is a great way to kill the myths and emphasis benefits. Also, people want to know it\'s usable, so showing a place to purchase it, the places to use it, that there is an active community to learn and get involved, will interest people instead of the fragmented image where people have to google and search directories for hours to find somewhere to use them.    \n  \nHere, Bitcoin is an idea, and fake money to most, until they have something tangible to take home that shows them direct benefits that apply to their life, in a lifestyle message.   Flyers, not very expensive, but they do cost something... Perhaps a local print shop considering accepting bitcoin would be a help if we approached them and dedicated a spot for their logo.\n  \nSupported by some super cheap guerrilla marketing in the form of street art perhaps, creatively placed stickers, basically anything depending upon who the focus is on, lots to work with around the core of Calgary, have a few ideas written down that emphasis specific benefits depending upon the target audience, and of course the free channels mentioned above, kijiji, craiglist, local forums like beyond, maybe a 5$ facebook targeted ad the day prior to meetups. Bitcoin clubs at the U of C, MT Royal, Sait would also be great partners for speakers at meetups, topics and spreading the word... if they exist. \n     \nJust a few ideas off the top of my head.  I see a fragmented image in most communities, and IMO the community needs to grow as a whole, ATM\'s, places to spend, events... all together.  It might even be a good idea to see if we could get a little team of 5 going for promotional motivations, each person with a specific task say, one group focused on vendors and businesses, one group focused on connecting with individuals related to industries that will be using Bitcoin tomorrow, another focused on the meetups and events,  and another on partnerships, marketing online and bringing it all together. Just an idea to distribute tasks so nobody is overloaded.  \n   \nRight now I am unemployed so $$ is an issue, but I can donate lots of time and ideas.   \n   \nI am convinced that a flyer / brochure / take home is what people need to feel like Bitcoin is tangible, and well, real.   \n  \nJust a few ideas off the top of my head ***prior to morning coffee*** so they are probably all over the place forgive me, but I think there are a few Bitcoiners around here that would be willing to help donate their time or resources to the cause if there was a goals, a strategy and an estimate of how their contributed 100$ towards a batch of flyers will bring a return or traffic to their retail location. Heck, local Bitcoin\'s might be willing to assist for a logo front and center on a flyer.    \n  \n\n  \n   \n\n': 2, "Agreed...   \n>Adults in Business &/or Corporate Settings   \n     \nNeeds to be segmented a bit more.  What industries are we focusing on.  Perhaps the Starbucks 20% off is a good idea to push considering that's a pretty big selling point for most, and an easy entry for obvious value.   I think it's super important to target specific industries, ie. Financial investment, economic focused industry, day traders, forex investors, small business tired of getting mangled by charge-backs, eCommerce based in calgary, perhaps news papers for donations, industries with lots of travel. But for any success, these people also need to be in an are where its tangibly feasible to use Bitcoin somewhere as well as purchase it. I think it's important to grow in context of community location for that reason. \n   \nSame with vendors, if nobody is going to use it, they will stop accepting it. So area focus seems pretty important in a context of actual use case leading to adoption or want to learn.   \n   \nAbsolutely, there needs to be drivers in the industry.

At that point the flood gates open.": 0, "Let's do some math...\n\nFrom the Coindesk article about the Wedbush report:\n> At that time [2025], Wedbush expects bitcoin to account for 10% of the $5.9tn online payments market, 20% of the $744bn remittance market and 20% of the $924bn microtransactions market.\n\n1) Calc the total economic activity Wedbush is predicting to run over bitcoin in 2025 from the above three markets:\n(10%)($5.9T) + (20%)($744B) + (20%)($924B) = **$923.6B**. \n\n2) Let's approximate the total supply of bitcoins in 2025 as the full 21,000,000 BTC issuance. \n\n3) Now let's calculate how much purchasing power each bitcoin would need in order for the whole system to transact $923.6B in one year, making the conservative assumption that all bitcoins are used for this (ie, none are sitting idle in cold-storage, etc). That means we need to figure the velocity of money for the economy (eg, how quickly a given unit changes hands during the year). Velocity is about 1.5 for the dollar. Let's say it's double that for Bitcoin (since bitcoin has a lot less friction). So, **V=3**.\n\nMoney supply = Total transacted / Velocity ... So, M = $923.6B / 3 = **$307.8B**\n\nAnd now for the dollar-purchasing-power per BTC:\n\n$307.8B / 21,000,000 = **$14,657 per BTC**\n\nLots of approximations and assumptions, but that's the guts of what Wedbush is really saying.\n\n\n\nIt's nice to see Wall St. firms starting to do the same calculations many of us made in 2011.": 21, "u don't understand how price targets work.... they just revise them as they go.": 6, 'Wow that is a very good analysis from a bank and summarized very well and precisely ': 2, 'Analysts at Wedbush, the West Coast brokerage and investment bank, are embracing the Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC).\n\nThe instrument, which is quoted on the OTCQX over-the-counter market, is the first and only means to buy and sell bitcoin with a standard brokerage account in the U.S. It\xe2\x80\x99s structured as an open-ended trust, and the price of the trust is meant to represent 1/10 of bitcoin\xe2\x80\x99s price. GBTC has been trading a premium since May. The Wall Street Journal  last week highlighted some of the early hiccups associated with trading GBTC.\n\nBut it\xe2\x80\x99s a buy for Gil Luria at Wedbush, which appears to be the first Wall Street firm to assign a rating to the trust. He assigns an \xe2\x80\x9coutperform\xe2\x80\x9d rating and a $40 price target. GBTC added d0.6% to $30.50 on Tuesday.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe believe bitcoin and its associated blockchain technology have the potential to disrupt the existing financial infrastructure over the next few years.\n\nWe see BTC as a financial instrument the likes of which has not previously existed, which requires a new valuation approach. We see BTC as equity in a payment network, much like Visa, MasterCard and PayPal, which we also cover.\n\nHowever, since BTC does not generate cash flow like equity, we use a commodity-like valuation approach that values each BTC as a \xe2\x80\x98packet\xe2\x80\x99 in limited supply that fuels the bitcoin network. The more the bitcoin network is utilized for current and future applications, the more demand for the packet.\n\nBy aggregating the utilization of the various applications, we arrive at our $400 BTC price target, which translates to $40 per share of GBTC. This implies ~$6 billion market capitalization, which we would also describe an option on bitcoin supplanting some payment volumes from Visa (V), MasterCard (MA), PayPal (PYPL) and Western Union (WU), who combine for >$300 billion in market cap.\n\nWe believe much of the demand for BTC will come from payment applications where bitcoin offers significant benefits over alternatives \xe2\x80\x93 online payments (especially cross-border), remittance and micro payments. We believe bitcoin can reduce the cost of online payments from the current 3-8% to <0.5% and for remittance from 5-10% to <1%.

Then you would only have to hard fork it one time and it keeps increasing for a very, very long time as storage and bandwidth become cheaper. If the curve of technological progress changes greatly, which is very unlikely, then we will hard fork again. This paper on BIP100 shows it as an almost absolute certainty that we will need to hard fork at least twice. I would rather have 1 guaranteed hard fork with a low chance of needing future hard forks than to have a very high, near certain chance of future necessary hard forks. \n\nAlso, don't try to sweep the problem under the rug by saying that we will likely have other issues that need a hard fork and raising the limit at that time would be an easy code change to slip in. Anybody who has worked in IT for 5 minutes knows that the optimal change to any sort of network is to do one thing at a time, every time, if possible. Want to upgrade all the rack servers in your data center? Yeah, you should probably pick a time to do that, and only that, and hold off on that power grid redundancy project for a little while longer. One thing at a time. Let's not leave a minefield of necessary hard forks that we'll have to wander through while managing whatever other problems occur in the bitcoin network.\n\nSame thing as upgrading the drivers for your hardware. Sure, you could go through the entire data center and upgrade every driver/bios for every device at the exact same time. I mean, you could do that if you were an idiot that wanted to lose his job. I would suggest updating the firmware on all of the drives at the same time while doing absolutely nothing else. If that all works out fine, then you can move onto ethernet card drivers, and so and so forth.\n\nI hope what I'm saying all comes together. The best option will likely be the one that requires the least amount of hard forking in the future combined with some other simplistic aspects, such as choosing a fixed rate of increase of a much more complicated dynamic increase over time.

NO.  ': 2, 'So, no then?': 3, 'This is a more complicated question than you might think so let me try to explain the many "yes" and "no" answers depending on context.\n\nAs you may be aware, the bitcoin protocol designates "the" blockchain as the longest chain. This is important because there\'s nothing stopping a miner from simply ignoring everybody else\'s blocks and continuing on it\'s own chain. The reason that doesn\'t happen is because the protocol, and the majority of people who use bitcoin, wouldn\'t consider it "the" blockchain and hence the ledger would be meaningless. It\'s important to realize this is a pretty arbitrary distinction in the same way that the test net isn\'t considered real money. It works in almost exactly the same way as the real blockchain but everybody agrees it\'s not real money.\n\nSo, that being said, what can and does happen on occasion is due to propagation issues or two miners finding a block at almost exactly the same time there will be two blockchains. At that point a decision has to be made by the miners. Which blockchain do they use? The best answer is of course the chain with the most hashing power as that is the chain which is likely to grow quicker and will defeat the other chain. Problem is, the miners don\'t always know which chain that is so some guesswork comes into play. Sometimes it makes sense to just stick with one until you get relayed a block that\'s more than two or three ahead of yours. Time to cut your losses and the block you mined and get back to work on the main chain.\n\nSo, here\'s the first example of how bitcoins can be "stolen" or at least taken away. A miner mines a block but it doesn\'t end up in the longest chain so they don\'t receive any rewards. These are called "orphaned blocks".\n\nAnother way bitcoins can be stolen in this process is if someone sends out two sets of transactions to these miners. One transaction sends all the money from Wallet A to Wallet B and another transaction sends all the money from Wallet A to Wallet C. This is called a "double spend" attack and it takes advantage of the confusion that occurs when there are two competing chains. Eventually one chain will win out so the money will really only be spent once but if you can temporarily trick someone into thinking the transaction which eventually ends up discarded in an orphan block you can receive your goods and disappear into the night.\n\nThe important thing to notice in all of this is that the chain which has value is really just the chain that most people agree has value. So if the majority of the miners, nodes, exchanges and general bitcoin users population decides "Hey something went very wrong at block height 300,000. We\'re gonna roll it back." it could happen. Something like this already happened but the community was a lot smaller back then.\n\nPoint is, yes, the ledger can be rolled back. It wouldn\'t be easy because you\'d need a reason that a lot of different parties can get behind but it is possible. That\'s why the decentralization aspect is so important. The more people that are involved, the harder it is to alter the ledger for corrupt or insignificant reasons.\n\nTL;DR - Buy a miner and run a node to keep it from happening.': 3, 'Thank you, this need to be voted up.': 1, 'But those who spent them would have them back, no?

While the economic utility of a consumable good is created when it is destroyed or used up, the utility of investment assets lies in their possession and later resale. Industrial commodities therefore have low stock-to-flow ratios, this is to say, inventories usually only cover consumption demand for a few months. If there were no inventories at all, supply would have to correspond exactly to production and demand exactly to consumption. However, if there are inventories, consumption can temporarily exceed production. Since inventories of consumable commodities are as a rule very low, prices will rise quickly in anticipation of a future supply shortage and bring consumption into balance with production.\n\nUnlike consumable commodities, gold and silver exhibit a large discrepancy between annual production and the total available supply which is a high stock-to-flow ratio. It is our premise that the high stock-to-flow ratio represents the most important characteristic of gold (and silver). The entire amount of gold ever mined totals approximately 172,000 tons. That is the stock. Annual production was about 2,700 tons as of 2012. That is the flow. If one divides the two amounts, one arrives at the stock-to-flow ratio of currently 64 years.\n\nGold isn\xe2\x80\x99t as valuable because it is so rare, but quite the opposite: Gold is valued so highly because annual production relative to the existing stock is so small. Putting it differently: not only scarcity, but primarily the relative constancy of the available stock is what makes gold unique. The annual production of 2,700 tons is therefore not relevant to price determination. This characteristic was attained over centuries and can no longer be altered. This stability and security is a crucial precondition for creating confidence.\n\nsource: http://www.incrementum.li/en/research-analysis/gold-stock-to-flow-ratio/\n-------\n\nGold has a StFR of about 80 and that will slowly increase with time/stock.
