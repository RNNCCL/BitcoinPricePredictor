I pointed out that removal of the limit is foolhardy. You cannot account for the unknowable problems that are associated with it. The *myriad* of problems that would have occurred had it not been there makes it much more likely there are also a myriad of unknown problems that still exists.\n\nFor example, how many people knew that if you filled a transaction with a ton of inputs it would take a miner quadratically longer to validate a block that contained that type of transaction? Gavin's 100 kb transaction limit was put in place to prevent that attack. Can you imagine if that wasn't discovered and a miner put a 2 MB heavy input transaction in a block? That very obvious problem was fixed, but what about the other ones that *we don't even know about*?\n\nThe fact that a blocksize limit was in place *of any size* is more important. Getting the right size is hard and requires research. Or we can just put more fuel into our unstaged rocket and see what happens.": 2, "If I build something like bitcoin I would consider O(n2) as a bug.

Of course he couldn\'t see the future, but he could make some educated guesses... he had mentioned Bitcoin supporting many transactions per second, but he puts that in? Why?

He only puts a block size limit in at the advent of of the slashdotting and posts like this: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1332.0 (in fact, satoshi commented in that thread 1 day prior to NACKing jgarzik\'s post). It is kind of funny reading what Theymos posts in that thread, I\'m sure you can use that as some ad hominem ammunition if you want.\n\nThe concrete is far from dry. There\'s a reason Satoshi was fearful of onboarding a lot of users shortly before disappearing. Why he asked for a gentleman\'s agreement to limit GPU mining and why he thought the hornet\'s nest was kicked when Bitcoin was used to fund wikileaks. He was fearful of growth... and the problems he was afraid of are exactly the problems that are so close to being fixed now, all the while the existential threat of the mob is growing.\n\n> Larger block limit would make it harder to attack bitcoin, not easier.\n\nYou can\'t prove that because you can\'t "foresee the future." But you can lessen the chance of it with days of careful analyses and tests which are peer-reviewed and tested. So far the data I\'ve seen (Rusty\'s work, Gavin\'s work, sipa\'s work, Miller\'s work) is insufficient in proving that since they are often contradictory.

The problem is that it's a leading question/false dilemma.\n\n> Question for you. Would we introduce a 1mb limit at this moment when there would have been none? Because somehow the choice to change something is met with more scrutiny than doing nothing.\n\nProbably not. I may choose a limit that would be higher or lower depending on what available data I have. The important point is that I would choose a blocksize limit, though.\n\nNow to answer why the question is ridiculous on it's face:\n\nSatoshi made the choice to change something by adding that limit in the first place. Understanding why he did that is integral to understanding why it can't just be removed. Even if it was meant as a way to prevent spam/dust transactions I still don't think we've adequately addressed handling those problems. I believe that if he hadn't of added it, somebody else would have due to it being a rather pragmatic fix to a very hard problem. Gavin argues that we have addressed the problems (or that we can address them as they come up), Maxwell/Back argues that we haven't (and if we address them as they come up, it may already be too late). Garzik is kind of between, but he recognizes that long term security depends on users of the system paying adequate fees to maintain the good security properties.\n\n> And if an algorithm has O(n2) complexity that is a huge bug, the block size has nothing to to with that. It doesn't sound professional at all if people start making excuses why such a limit exists afterwards.\n\nNo. An algorithm that has O ( n^2 ) complexity doesn't mean it has a bug, it means you have to apply the algorithm where there is low n to be practical. (Edit: Also hope you can make a better algorithm). The fact that validating transactions in worse case was and technically still is O ( n^2 ) is warning of other potential O ( n^2 ) problems hiding in the rafters.": 1, "I'd argue that one side doesn't want to use the 1 MB size limit, but wants to make sure that the next limit chosen is a good choice.

Anwendungstechnisch kann Bitcoin als First-to-File System beschrieben werden.

Until now, Bitcoin has drawn currency is the bulk of public attention.

Application point can be described as Bitcoin First-to-file system. For example, if Instance A 50 BTC owns and these will be sent simultaneously to Instance B and C only that transaction hich is first confirmed. The problem that there is no inherent way to determine which transaction was executed first, disabled jahrzzehntelang developing a decentralized digital means of payment. Satoshi block chain is the first serious decentralized solution. Now the time is reached, at which the public interest turns more and more this second part of the Bitcoin technology.

That\xe2\x80\x99s an annual increase of 36% for downloads and 37% for uploads\n\nDoubling every two years (BIP 101) would be about 40%, a bit higher. So not very far. But now consider the improvement over a longer time scale. When I first used the internet at home about 20 years ago, I had a 33.6kbit model. It was normal at the time. I now have a 75 megabit/sec connection at home. So that\'s a roughly 2000x increase in 20 years. BIP 101 caps out at assuming a 1000x increase. It\'s conservative.\n\nAlso bear in mind that running Bitcoin doesn\'t max out your internet connection today, or anything even close (in steady state; it will use it all if you\'re sending the full chain to a newly installed node).\n\nSo there\'s plenty of headroom.\n\nBy the way, I did all these calculations years ago. Do you really think I\'d have spent so much time developing Bitcoin if I thought it couldn\'t become a major success?

As we said on the thread on the XT mailing list, real tests with real nodes on real computers spread around the world (different VPS providers) were already done last year. I do not agree that Gavin\'s testing was "highly inadequate". We\'ve got nothing against doing *even more* testing with PlanetLab, but as Gavin says, you have to know what you\'re actually testing for.\n\n> You previously indicated that Blockstream working on and funding Lightning is a waste of time and not relevant to Bitcoin ... but, Gavin contradicted this when he said\n\nI don\'t think it\'s a waste of time. I think it *might* end up being a waste of time, if what is produced works worse than ordinary Bitcoin does, which is highly possible.\n\nYes, Gavin and I disagree on this topic. I look at our trivial traffic levels today, I look at how fast computers are, and I think .... wow. Bitcoin needs to get mind-blowingly more popular than it is today before we ever hit any kinds of problems at all. Making Bitcoin so popular is hard work. \n\nI think Gavin is more of a bridge-builder than I am. He is happy to say "sure, this is ugly and can-kicking but we need it anyway" if he thinks it\'d help unruffle feathers, bring about cooperation and agreement (it didn\'t). BIP 101 indicates what he actually believes when he\'s not trying to make nice: computers are fast and getting faster, Bitcoin is small and growing only slowly. There is little risk. Put another way, we can "kick the can" with current technology all the way to the moon. If one day we go to the moon, sure, fine, we\'ll need a Bitcoin 2.0. Maybe. But who cares? That\'s so far in the future that by the time it happens we might all be dead.\n\n> Adam Back said he was okay with 2MB 2016, 4MB 2018, 8MB 2020. More to the point, he has explicitly said he would support the BIP at the upcoming conference that is best supported by data\n\nThat certainly is the right sort of thing to say, but the problems remain:\n\n1. The conference says nobody can discuss BIPs. Jeff intends to anyway and this has been triggering arguments on private threads I\'m CCd on, so I can see this ugly fight play out.\n2. Regardless of what Adam picks, his own employees disagree, and Wladimir still demands consensus. Additionally, Wladimir also doesn\'t want the block size to rise. So what Adam wants is largely irrelevant until that roadblock is demolished.\n\nRe: debate. There can be no decorous debate when one side simply isn\'t reading or responding to arguments from the other side. Go find the reasoned, well written rebuttals to the articles Gavin and I have painstakingly put together over the last 6 months.

I\'ve only seen arguments that it might limit long term growth requirements.\n\nIn the first message I have in my mailbox that mentions Lightning from Gregory, he says that his analysis is that the block size should actually *shrink*. Then he asks if anyone is familiar with Lightning, and throws in an ad hominem in which he claims I think everyone should run datacenter-sized nodes (I never said this).\n\nIt\'s in the thread "Block Size Increase" started by Matt.\n\nIn the thread announcing the funding, someone asks the basic question: Lightning needs larger blocks, but Gregory and Pieter have been \'pouring cold water\' on the idea of raising block sizes:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/37fxqd/it_looks_like_blockstream_is_working_on_the/crmdfqm\n\nAnd Gregory\'s response doesn\'t talk about raising block size limits at all, but rather things like "stopping the clock" when blocks are full.\n\nGiven this sort of thing, can you really be surprised that so many people have got this impression?\n\n> I don\'t know what made you suggest it to Greg, but the funding decision was not about blocksize at all. \n\nIt seems both you and Adam believe that I suggested funding Lightning! Where did this idea come from?

It\'s toxic, and I\'m trying to minimize my exposure.\n\nThis is not "my" debate, Rusty. Maybe you didn\'t notice but the entire community is talking about nothing else right now. Heck the most common sentiment expressed to me about this is "why is this even a debate at all", and I agree!\n\nThe reason Blockstream\'s reputation is getting trashed is it\'s completely incoherent approach to the issue. Literally every employee seems to have different and incompatible ideas about what to do, but none of them involve supporting actually implemented code or straightforward proposals.\n\nRaising the block size limit is a no brainer that was never meant to be such a huge drama. If it\'s true that you all support doing it, then write an open letter showing your support for BIP101: so far the only BIP that has actual code behind it. If in future it unexpectedly turns out Bitcoin can\'t scale further, there can always be another fork to take the network off the BIP101 schedule.': 0, 'You are doing exactly what I said you\'d do - blowing off the huge amount of work involved in Lightning by saying "it\'s just money".\n\nRusty\'s comment:\n\n> "That\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of work! But it\xe2\x80\x99s all simply engineering from here, just as bitcoin was once the paper was released."\n\nUm, yes. It\'s just engineering. And as you may have noticed after huge engineering efforts by thousands of people for over 5 years, Bitcoin still has a lot of basic usability, safety and functionality problems. There is a TON of engineering to do just to make the basic A-to-B payment functionality work well. Going back to square one and doing it all over again makes *no* sense. Yes, Blockstream got a lot of money to spend on whatever they want: good for them. If they want to develop an entirely new system from scratch, they should go for it. But the rest of the Bitcoin community needs to continue with the tech they\'ve already developed.\n\n> If this can work, it really offers true scalability potential (without resorting to potentially turning Bitcoin into PayPal 2.0, down the line).\n\n> > I\'m asking you directly: do you care if Bitcoin miners or node operators get regulated with AML/KYC and thus Bitcoin becomes PayPal 2.0\n\nYou\'re in the grip of a false dichotomy. Indeed, you are just repeating Blockstream talking points almost verbatim without thinking about them.\n\nThere is no chance of this ever happening and we proved it with basic, back of the envelope calculations years ago. PayPal only has a few hundred tx/sec, that\'s well within reach of optimisations of the basic block chain algorithm. Do the calculations yourself. A thousand signatures/sec or so doesn\'t even strain a single CPU these days. A few hundred tx/sec is about 85 megabyte blocks. With pruning, optimised block propagation protocols and some code optimisations that\'s achievable by ordinary computers that we have today. But we\'d have to increase Bitcoin usage by about 300x to get there. That would take a very,  very long time.\n\nBelieving that Bitcoin can scale and still look pretty much like it does today is not only entirely reasonable, but backed with lots of calculations based on real data. The belief that we have to pick between usage and decentralisation is a scare story pushed Blockstreamers. Do you really think so many people would have signed up to work on Bitcoin if it were true? If so why did you never hear about Lightning Network up until this summer? If we all thought Bitcoin topped out at 1mb there\'d have been serious cross-ecosystem work done on this stuff years ago.\n\n> Again, my belief, which may contrast with yours, is that the UI/UX work comes at the end. It\'s not fair to judge it when it\'s at its beginning, and pessimistically paint a picture. \n\nThis is a classic mistake made by theoretical cryptographers over and over again. \n\nLook, I worked on consumer products for years. Some of them had nearly a billion users. We didn\'t have the luxury of developing pie-in-the-sky ideas with no idea of how the resulting product would actually work for end users, because we needed to ship products in a competitive market.\n\nBlowing off extremely basic concerns by saying "that stuff is easy, we\'ll worry about it at the end" is a guaranteed path to failure. Which is FINE as long as the rest of the Bitcoin community isn\'t being force-fed this stuff.\n\nWhich is exactly what is happening by Blockstream and Wladimir stonewalling block size increases.\n\n> However, people like Adam Back, Greg Maxwell, etc. can\'t be painted with a broad brush like that. They have nuanced, reasoned positions\n\nI\'m afraid I disagree. Gregory in particular, holds very extreme positions, I find often based on not much. They are just a lot better at hiding it.\n\nFor instance just recently he claimed nobody had tested reorgs of chains with >1mb blocks. That\'s a basic scalability test and he asserted nobody had done it, presumably to try and convince people that scaling the block chain is a dark swamp of unknown factors.\n\nIn fact Gavin had tested it months ago, published his results, and blogged about them. Gregory just didn\'t bother reading what he did.\n\nSo these are guys who claim to be experts in Bitcoin scalability, but who aren\'t reading or even aware of basic published results by an experienced developer who predates all of them.': 24, 'Blockstream a non-profit??\nAre you serious?': 1, 'i think this "your debate is toxic"-narrative is one blockstream created.. \nhow can a debate be toxic? how else do you want to solve the situation that there are opposing ideas and opposing thoughts? debating.. right.. its not always fun and maybe also exhausting but just telling the people who are going through it that this is toxic and putting your head back into the sand.. well done..': 1, "You're outlining the great tragedy of Blockstream: that Austin Hill could buy and sequester all the best Bitcoin devs for $21 million United States dollars.\n\nThe price for the ownership of a multibillion dollar financial system has been proved less than the average CEO severance package.": 3, "You blanket accusation of pettiness is frankly disappointing.

For everyone else who would like some additional privacy but who isn\'t worried about getting shot, the consequence of Tor\'s current approach is that they just don\'t use Tor.\n\nhttps://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-July/007187.html\n\n> I don\'t agree that it backfired. Yes, some people didn\'t like such discussions at all.

This rendered its mathematical capabilities irrelevant. When Snowden wanted to talk to Greenwald using PGP he couldn\'t do it because PGP sucks so badly.

Tor is finding out the hard way that you don\'t need government coercion to end up widely shunned. Even the developers own IRC network is now blocking Tor. Gregory Maxwell has described Tor as heading towards a read only web, and he\'s not wrong. This inherently limits its mainstream appeal and weakens the "anonymity loves company" principle it relies on for protection.\n\n> If we\'re going to make crypto both strong and mainstream, then the community needs to start thinking through the consequences of that for society at large.\n\nhttps://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-July/007176.html\n\nAnyway, I\'m digressing, but I hope I\'ve made my point that one can have different opinions on matters, yet still have their opinion respected and politely disagreed with without stereotyping them as this or that, or making assumptions as to their motivations. We can pick on Mike like we\'re in the schoolyard as if he\'s the odd one out because of strength of numbers and since it\'s easy, but that literally is a recipe for making an enemy and having unproductive discourse.

Confidential Transactions being one example.  Most of the side-chains alpha features could be back-ported to Bitcoin core however some would require more work to soft-fork.\n\nAnother potential with side-chains (or extension-blocks) is that we could have opt-in subnets of Bitcoin that make different security throughput tradeoffs.  In that way potentially bip101 like parameters could be used in one subnet and various values tested for markets that prefer different tradeoffs.\n\nSide-chain and extension block security has a number of trade-offs and options, but is different to Bitcoin-core slightly.  For apples to apples comparison it should be noted that Bitcoin core adopting a prematurely large block-size would also have security implications.  People who are comfortable with accepting security risk to get a moderate throughput increase may like the side-chain tradeoff.  If cups of coffee range of payments adopt such a chain it's a step forward from all using a hosted wallet or whatever happens today.\n\nThe main thing people are really complaining about is the question of pushing the block-size to a poor security / throughput position with no opt-in choice for users who prefer Bitcoin's ethos features.\n\nCentralisation of the development process would also be a related risk.\n\nI do think if we changed Bitcoin block-size too high immediately it would create security and decentralisation problems.  I also think that /u/mike_hearn has different views about the importance of economically dependent full-nodes being essential part of Bitcoin's security model in setting the consensus rules.  If I understand both /u/mike_hearn and /u/gavinandresen are more relaxed about an ever shrinking ratio of economically dependent full nodes, which to my mind risks building paypal 2.0.  From what /u/gavinandresen says I think he thinks it is more important to increase throughput and create free transactions with excess capacity to drive adoption and use-cases than for Bitcoin to retain policy neutrality etc.  /u/mike_hearn I dont think has given up on red-lists and adapting Bitcoin to hierarchical and policy influence.  \n\nFeel free to contradict me if you think that's inaccurate, but I truly think this misunderstanding and optimism about the side-effects of centralisation is why /u/gavinandresen and /u/mike_hearn arrive at different proposals to everyone else.\n\nWhen smart-people disagree there is usually an unstated different assumption.

That was the first red flag. Bitcoin is software. It can be and has been upgraded in the past. There\'s no reason to believe it\'s immutable, bugs and all. When I called on the investor community to support Bitcoin development, that obviously meant *upgrades to Bitcoin*.\n\nThe second was when they hired a bunch of people who had been contributing to Bitcoin development, and they ended up working on side chains instead. I think only Pieter Wiulle continued doing any serious code upgrades to Bitcoin Core after being hired by Blockstream (e.g. headers first, libsecp256k1) and Gregory wrote a few patches to libsecp256k1, but if you look at the big headline upgrades in the last few Core releases, they were pretty much all written by Pieter.

The list of work items he gives is HUGE.

I can imagine the work items are huge, and the work involved is strenuous. However, if we will cite Rusty\'s (u/rustyreddit) summary of LN requirements, and considering he is the lead developer in charge of bringing it to fruition, then we must acknowledge he has some authority on it, right?\n\nRusty\'s last line in that link is:\n> "That\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of work!  But it\xe2\x80\x99s all simply engineering from here, just as bitcoin was once the paper was released.  I look forward to seeing it happen (and I\xe2\x80\x99m confident it will)."\n\nI think it\'s also helpful to consider Rusty\'s bio (hence credibility):\n> Rusty is a well-known Linux kernel maintainer, renowned for his foundational work on modules and iptables. After 14 years as a senior developer at IBM, he took a six-month sabbatical to work on cryptocurrencies and hasn\xe2\x80\x99t looked back. Rusty has worked on a plethora of low-level code over the years, spoken at dozens of conferences around the world and also founded the first Australian Linux conference. He continues to maintain some Linux kernel parts as a hobby, while devoting most of his time to exploring the emerging frontier of Bitcoin development.\n\nMoreover, Blockstream chose to divert some of its investor capital pre-destined for sidechain tech, instead to funding Lightning and Rusty full-time. This is yet another vote of confidence.\n\nFurther, referencing u/adam3us\'s recent interview on a16z, Adam stated (I think) 4 other companies are also working on implementing Lightning (one example: https://thunder.network). There is apparent collaboration, too.\n\nFinally, Rusty recently had a breakthrough that helps Lightning be deployable more easily and quickly (in the short-term) than previously envisioned:\n> https://github.com/ElementsProject/lightning/blob/master/doc/deployable-lightning.pdf\n\nHonestly, please devote some time to carefully reading and understanding Lightning v1, Rusty\'s improvement, and the updated Lightning v2 whitepaper (http://lightning.network). If u/gavinandresen has not devoted adequate time to it, please urge him to do so also. If this can work, it really offers true scalability potential (without resorting to potentially turning Bitcoin into PayPal 2.0, down the line).\n\nPlease, in the interest of understanding, also take a look at this most recent blog post by Rusty (no direct link available for some odd reason, but it is currently the top-most post) -- it seems to aim to clarify the present situation:\n> https://blockstream.com/blog/\n\n>> Excerpt: "People ask why we\xe2\x80\x99re investing a whole developer into the Lightning Network?

That\'s a neat and useful trick, regardless, it doesn\'t change the basic reality end users will perceive: they will walk up to a Bitcoin ATM, attempt to buy some money with it, and then discover their phone and the device don\'t talk to each other because one is expecting money on side-chain-of-the-day, or on a Lightning Network node, and the other is just running plain old Bitcoin.\n\nAgain, my belief, which may contrast with yours, is that the UI/UX work comes at the end. It\'s not fair to judge it when it\'s at its beginning, and pessimistically paint a picture. Since we\'re dealing with software and moreover cryptocurrency not fiat, this is all inherently interoperable. Check out shapeshift.io -- Look how easily it allows cryptocurrencies to be converted back and forth (albeit with conversion fee).\n\nYou mentioned earlier:\n> They just want to buy or sell something priced in BTC. So your wallet has to find a cross-chain trader somehow, and make the trade, and presumably pay fees for that, and then make the payment on the side chain\n\nWe can ask the experts in charge of developing sidechains, but I don\'t think this is how it will work at all. Since the currency remains \'bitcoin\', whether on the main chain or the side chain, there is no \'cross-chain trader\' required and certainly no \'fees\' for conversion. As I mentioned in the shapeshift.io example, presumably funds can easily be converted back and forth. Clearly there needs to be wallet integration for both side chains and Lightning, but why the worry? The UI/UX work to integrate it smoothly will come in due time. Let\'s not be concerned so prematurely :).\n\n---\n\n> No other company is operating under bizarre assumptions like the Bitcoin network being unchangeable, or that Bitcoin can\'t possibly scale.

However, people like Adam Back, Greg Maxwell, etc. can\'t be painted with a broad brush like that. They have nuanced, reasoned positions.\n\nThey do not say Bitcoin cannot scale, just that the rate of scaling will have repercussions WRT decentralization.

If you have some BTC and want to buy something from a merchant that only accepts a SideCoin, you must know that and then move your coins across. And by that I mean, your wallet must do it because the user doesn\'t care about *how* any given feature is implemented. They just want to buy or sell something priced in BTC. So your wallet has to find a cross-chain trader somehow, and make the trade, and presumably pay fees for that, and then make the payment on the side chain, and ideally this all has to happen very fast and invisibly.\n* If your money is currently on a side chain and you find a merchant who doesn\'t support that chain, you need to move it back onto the main bitcoin block chain. Same problem.\n* If you would like two features that are implemented in two different side chains you can\'t have that. You have to pick where your money is. But remember, users don\'t care about or likely even know about side chains. They just want their stuff to work. Explaining why some features are mutually exclusive with each other or which seem to randomly work/not work depending on who you\'re trading with is an extremely hard UX design problem (read: the user interfaces will probably be confusing and suck)\n\nYou seem to think that freezing the Bitcoin block chain and doing feature upgrades on side chains is a technical no brainer. I see it as a highly speculative experiment that\'s very likely to yield poor results if side chains are expected to be used by ordinary end users, thus being no replacement for actually adding features to the main Bitcoin block chain. Side chains might prove a useful half-way point between the existing test net and main block chain but I can\'t see it being more than that.\n\nIt\'s for these reasons I do not consider side chains in any way "core development", no moreso than I would consider my experiments with smart contracts apps "core development". They\'re cool lines of research that are worth exploring, in the full knowledge and expectation that they may not work out.\n\n> the fact that devs responsible for 90% of commits on Core in the last 1-2 years signed that recent letter expressing support for the Core approach shows the vast majority of devs are happy with the development status quo\n\nThat\'s circular.

Or, did you read the very first blog post by Blockstream by the co-founders, on why they co-founded Blockstream and their vision? Both these articles, available right from the start, explicitly laid out Blockstream\'s plan: A focus on bringing theoretical \'sidechains\' technology to life.\n\nSo, I\'m not sure why you were *"happy"* and then *"things went downhill"* and how \'side chains\' was the *"first red flag"*...\n\n* https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20141117154558-1213-the-future-of-the-bitcoin-ecosystem-and-trustless-trust-why-i-invested-in-blockstream\n> In pursuit of this public good, I have personally invested in a start-up called Blockstream.

It is core infrastructure work, and one could imagine it\'s one of the most important pieces of work.\n\nWhile I understand your concern about developers not all working directly on the protocol, the fact that devs responsible for 90% of commits on Core in the last 1-2 years signed that recent letter expressing support for the Core approach shows the vast majority of devs are happy with the development status quo.\n\nBut still... you bring up a good point.

There are many non-Blockstream actors who have made essentially the same argument.\n\nDid you see BitFury\'s report? You cite "back of the envelope calculations" which surely has its place, but BitFury did substantial data analysis and found CPU / disk storage is the least of one\'s concerns, as those increase by Moore\'s Law. Instead, the issue is primarily RAM and bandwidth / data caps. What is your response to that, or ideally data that disproves it?\n\nEven Muneeb Ali said the same here:\n> https://forum.blockstack.org/t/blockstack-community-thoughts-on-block-size-bitcoin-xt-debate/152/8\n\n>> lopp: "Also, the limit doubles every two years which is consistent with trends in technological progress."\n\n>> muneeb: "Not really true for network bandwidth and for memory. Largely true for computing and storage. Larger blocksize is more dependent on network/memory than disk/computing."\n\nDo you have data to disprove it?\n\nInstead of "PayPal 2.0", we can switch the idea to "Visa 2.0" then (1,000x or higher increase). My point wasn\'t even about technically reaching 100x scalability though, because as cited just now, even 100x scalability is not that simple. Your argument was based on CPU and disk storage, but that has never been the concern of the other side. Even now, others supporting their argument have noted that is not the bottleneck.\n\n---\n\n**re: Data / Testing in the block size debate**\n\nYou said:\n> There is no chance of this ever happening and we proved it with basic, back of the envelope calculations years ago\n\n> Believing that Bitcoin can scale and still look pretty much like it does today is not only entirely reasonable, but backed with lots of calculations based on real data.

I actually used to do a lot of research work with simulations. Model a network topology, introduce latency (just like Gavin is doing in the simulator), and so on. We, and by we I mean the entire research community working on wireless networks of embedded devices, learned the hard way that our simulations were basically meaningless. A protocol that worked in a simulator wouldn\'t work in real-life. That\'s one of the main reasons why PlanetLab exists and why it got the SIGCOMM test of time award. **In the past 10+ years basically any significant real networked system developed by research labs / universities was deployed and tested on PlanetLab**. **It is a 1000x better than doing simulations.**\n\n> In fact, I\'d go far enough to say that **no testing is better than doing simulations**. **Simulations give you the false satisfaction that you\'ve tested something, when you really have not.** This is especially true for computer networks. I realize that simulations have their place in other areas.\n\nNow, I\'m not saying it\'s your fault that Washington apparently decided to drop out of the conversation at that point, and maybe he did not relay Muneeb\'s reply back to you? Either way, I checked out the Google Discussion thread, and as of 10 days ago, Gavin had said he did do testing earlier (simulation testing?), but was open to the idea of testing on PlanetLab... but that one needs to know what questions to answer first:\n> https://groups.google.com/d/msg/bitcoin-xt/P8We1DokNUk/X7cXjLE3BgAJ\n\nBut now that we see the imperative nature of using PlanetLab:\n\n1.

And, Blockstream has not really been saying Lightning can replace block size increases. As mentioned elsewhere in my post, u/adam3us has proposed a short-term size increase (2-4-8, in \'16-\'18-\'20), to allow time for Lightning development, so as to fairly evaluate Lightning\'s progress before committing to an aggressive plan.\n\nFair?\n\n---\n\nDifferent yet similar note, for the record, Gavin spoke positively about doing work on sidechains:\n> https://twitter.com/gavinandresen/status/453968257197027329\n\n---\n\n**re: Relevance of Lightning to the wider ecosystem / lack of necessity of the system**\n\nYou said:\n> If they want to develop an entirely new system from scratch, they should go for it.

This subtle "us vs. them" dialogue -- "these are guys who claim to be experts in Bitcoin scalability" -- is not helpful, especially when plenty of scaling work of a non-block size increase type has been done in the last couple years. The same can be said, in reverse, with certain dialogue from u/adam3us.

This is a 60% increase. Of the commits, ones made by people who work full time or contract for blockstream were 99 and 352, for the two time periods respectively, a 3.5 fold increase, and the increase from blockstream connected folks accounted for more than half the total increase in Bitcoin Core activity.\n\n> Without Pieter the counts from blockstream connected folks are 51 and 144-- also increasing just as much proportionally as Pieter\'s did.

That\'s fine if the heat wasn\'t part of something you\'re already extracting work from (as in the waste vehicle heat they suggest they can go after here).  In a miner, however, it\'s a bit of a different story.  There\'s very little "waste" heat--it\'s instead almost all the output of comparatively efficient computational operations.  If you "stop it up" by trying to harness the heat flow, you\'ll just introduce inefficiency at the chip level.  Even at ideal thermoelectric efficiencies, the amount of electricity you\'d get out wouldn\'t be enough to do as much computation as you lost by interfering with the chip cooling to do it.  You\'d make a net loss in work performed by introducing the thermoelectric generation layer.\n\nYou might be wondering why it matters if the heat is "waste" heat or not.  Well, for a crappy metaphor--if you\'re impeding the dissipation of heat for thermoelectric generation, then more of it is "piling up" at the input end.  But if that *input* end is the *output* end of another valuable process, you\'ll be "stopping up" that workflow by so doing, and reducing its effectiveness.  By comparison, if it wasn\'t actually a workflow you care about, then stopping it up won\'t cause any corresponding reduction in the main thing you were trying to do in the first place (and which was creating the heat).  So if you tried to harness the non-waste part of the ICE you would stop up the production of motion and slow the car down.  But if you harness a part that wasn\'t producing forward motion *anyways*, then stopping it up doesn\'t hurt your motion, and the gained energy is a strict bonus.  (Potentially easier to do in an ICE since it is so stupidly inefficient to start with compared to most ways you can use the electricity).\n\n**tl;dr** no, you can\'t use this for miners.  It would only introduce additional inefficiencies.': 8, 'No, peltier uses way too much energy.': 2, "Fuck they're smart": 2, '3% - cost': 1, "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_magnetoresistance possibly?(not sarcasm i don't know either)": 2, 'Yes': 2, 'First, let\'s fix your cooling misconception.  There are no devices that convert heat into electricity, only devices that convert a heat differential between a hot reservoir and a colder reservoir into electricity.  In so doing, they actually *interfere* with that heat flow, making the hot side stay hotter than it would if the heat were allowed to flow directly to the colder side without having to perform work in between.  Thermoelectric generators don\'t *help* with cooling.  From the chip\'s perspective, they *hurt* the cooling.  A maximally efficient heat sink is a better chip cooler than a maximally efficient thermoelectric generator.  The thermoelectric generator reduces the *net* amount of heat by the amount of electricity extracted, but it reduces this heat on the *cool* side of the equation, not the hot side.  If you instead had a device that made heat flow from the hot side to the cool side *faster* than it otherwise would in a heatsink, that would be called a "refrigerator", and it *consumes* electricity rather than produces it (plus, it also puts more heat out the back end than it takes in at the front, making the cool side pay a heat penalty as well).  Thermoelectric generation does *not* do away with cooling systems.  You just end up moving them to the other end of the thermoelectric generator to try and keep the cool side cool because it\'s the limiting factor in your efficiency anyways (see [Carnot\'s Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnot%27s_theorem_(thermodynamics))).\n\nSecond, let\'s fix your turbo misconception.  The turbo on a car works the exact way I described:  by impeding the flow of the exhaust gases, it actually makes the engine *less* efficient at producing forward motion.  When you then take this energy and use it to compress air for your fuel mixture, you are not getting a profit back out of the exhaust gases, you are getting a profit out of the improved fuel combustion that results from the higher temperatures and increased oxygen availability inside the combustion chamber.  It is only because the combustion is so *in*efficient to begin with that this loop "turns a profit" in terms of forward motion:  because it unlocks more previously wasted chemical energy than it destroys in thermodynamic inefficiency.  If you already had a maximally efficient chemical-energy-to-forward-motion converter, adding a turbo to it would make your car *slow down*.\n\nNow in a miner, an ASIC is already the maximally efficient known machine for turning electricity into hashes, otherwise *that* machine would be the ASIC instead.  If you impede the cooling of the chip by attempting to extract work (the generation of electricity) from the heat differential between the hot chip and the comparatively cooler environment, you are similarly making the hash engine *less* efficient.  You can only hope to turn a profit if this harnessed energy can be used to improve the hash engine efficiency somehow, and by more than you\'ve damaged it.  Unfortunately, as we\'ve noted, the ASIC is *already* the most efficient known way of converting electricity into hashes, so there are no improvements available to spend your new electricity *on*.  And since the fact that you were running the ASIC at all tells me you value hashes more than electricity, even selling the electricity to any other use will still cost you more than you paid out to create it.  So either in hashes or dollars, this strategy won\'t turn you a profit.  The "turbo" is slowing down your "hash car".  (This analysis depends on the assumption that heat dissipation is a limiting factor in ASIC efficiency, which it definitely [is](http://www.chipex.co.il/_Uploads/dbsAttachedFiles/VirtualCurrencyEliGevaChipex.pptx)--if it wasn\'t, ASICs wouldn\'t be wasting electricity on mechanically turning fans to cool the chips.  If instead chips could get much hotter without tanking their efficiency, then adding thermoelectric generation wouldn\'t "stop up the workflow" very much as in my crappy metaphor.  In general, it\'s a pretty safe assumption that impeding heat flow in something with a heatsink will cost you more than it gives back, otherwise why did you build a heatsink?  The same principle would apply for bolting thermoelectric generators onto car radiators--you can be sure the thermoelectric generators will be going *elsewhere* in cars when they actually get there).': 2}, ('Overstock\xe2\x80\x99s T\xc3\x98 Platform is Reinventing Wall Street', 124): {'Whens his platform going to be released and is he still working with the Counterparty guys?

I don\'t know how this plays out, semantically, as being the *use* of the symbol in running text.  Substitute the symbol with, for example, the double circle logo of mastercard/maestro; is the symbol here really used as part of running text?  Perhaps put differently, in the example given, the use of the symbol directly could easily be substituted with "See figure X", with the referenced figure showing the symbol.

Therefore, it is in my opinion reasonable to treat the activation threshold as 69 % for all intents and purposes, because treating it as 68 % or lower would take several decades before there could be an unintentional triggering. \n\nThe BIP101 specification should keep specifying the threshold as being 75 % though, because that is technically and mathematically correct. But in regular conversation it may be preferable to advertise the BIP101 as having a theoretical 75 % threshold and a 69 % practical threshold, so non-statisticians won\'t get any unintentional surprises, if it turns out that the BIP101 activates somewhere between 69-75 % instead of exactly at 75 %.\n\n**tldr:**\n\nWhen thinking of the BIP101 trigger of 75 %, you should think of it being 69 % instead, and in doing so, you will be safe and be extremely unlikely to be surprised by an unintentional and premature triggering.': 3, "Don't do work someone else already did :)  \nhttp://organofcorti.blogspot.de/2015/08/bip101-implementation-flaws.html": 1}, ('ELI5 if I want to accept Bitcoin without using a third party do I need to run a full node?', 42): {'Its not anti-Bitcoin to "rely on a third party".

If you have an up-to-date blockchain, you have all the information you need to calculate the maximum block size for the next block.\n\nI agree with you on the rest of your points.\n": 8, "One of the costs to miners of increased block size is that the potential market price of transaction fees will almost certainly decrease.  If there is a lower limit on the number of transactions that can be processed per block, then people sending transactions must pay increased fees.  This is a basic microeconomic assumption, that I think is reasonable to make.  As the bitcoin network gets more popular for payments, the market price of transaction fees increases, which would in turn stimulate more miners to get running.  Bitcoin would only be feasible for larger transactions.  \n\nPersonally, I have two big problems with increasing the bitcoin blocksize or forking bitcoin. First, it threatens to lead to fragmentation of existing standards.  The only thing that makes bitcoin superior to other cryptocoins is the network effect.  Without bitcoin's hegemony, it would loose all or most of its value.  Thus, forking bitcoin, in my view, threatens to destroy the most important feature of bitcoin.\n\nThe second issue, is that, as I previously mentioned, increasing the block size decreases the market price of transaction fees, which in turn discourages continued investment in mining.  The people who argue for forking bitcoin, are suggesting that it is more important to keep transaction fees low for people who send transactions, than it is to allow them to creep up for the miners benefit.  At some point, it's simply a choice as to who one thinks should benefit.  But for me, at the end of the day, the miners run the network.  Changing the rules of bitcoin post-hoc to screw them doesn't really seem healthy for the future of bitcoin.\n\nBTW, I don't have any conflicts of interest to declare.  I don't do any mining, and if anything I would benefit from lower transaction fees, but that's not necessarily the best thing for the bitcoin network's health, IMHO.": 2, "I'd love an explanation actually, I have some idea how it works but not a very good understanding.

There has been convincing discussion (to me) that shows it will not significantly centralize the network. Having a max blocksize known well into the future has the benefit of reassuring those who want to use the blockchain to record information reliably. Increasing the blocksize immediately (come January) to 8mb is a good plan as it will protect the network from these ridiculous spammers and keep the blocks limited so no malicious miner can create giant blocks, a good balance. Bip 101 is also produced, the code is verifiable and clearly created with good intent. Bip 100 is more likely (but still unlikely) to be a subversive attack on the network at this point because we haven't seen it! \n\nBoth solutions require a hard fork of the network.

In classic PC you fund a 2-of-2 multisig transaction and the two parties adjust the spending transaction as to reflect the balances each party will have at the time of settlement.\n\nThe problem with this is that all previous versions of the spending transaction are valid. A misbehaving party could publish an earlier version to the blockchain therefore double-spending part of the payments. We need to be able to revoke past versions of transactions.\n\nLN solves this by having both parties exchange the private key used to redeem past versions of transaction and using new for each version. If one party decides to publish an earlier version the other can attempt to "steal" the funds as she knows the private key.\n\nAs of now there would be a race between the two parties as to who will be able to redeem the funds first. By using OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY we can specify that the attacker will need to wait 1000 confirmations (little less than a week) before being able to withdraw funds. In this time window you can detect the attempt on the blockchain and publish an appropriate transaction to take all funds immediately.\n\nUntil now we can update a transaction unlimited times where attempt of fraud will result in confiscation of coins. This allows us to construct a transaction that can be spent only upon disclosure of a secret value by requiring presence of a value which upon hashing gives a known result.\n\nWhen you want to transfer funds the receiver generates a random secret and discloses its hash to/through all intermediary hubs which update their PC to reflect this hash. Then the receiver discloses the secret to the connected hub which now makes the updated transaction valid. The secret passes from hub to hub until all PC are updated. At that point the receiver can generate a new secret for further receiving.\n\nIf any of the hubs misbehaves the appropriate PC can be enforced via the blockchain and a new route is chosen. Therefore LN works kind of like Tor: intermediary hubs don\'t need to know who the counterparties are. If a route is not reliable a new route can be chosen.\n\nThere are obviously some shortcomings like the need to backup relevant information and publishing the revocation transaction when needed but these can be automated and the effort of the attacker might not be justified due to the risk of losing all coins.': 7, 'Okay cool.
