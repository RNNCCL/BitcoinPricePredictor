': 1, "Before DACs and smart contracts can reach their full potential we definitely need a robust oracle system with reputations.  I struggle to imagine what a decentralized version would look like and how you can balance the need for reputations with pseudo-anonymity.    \n  \nThe best system I can imagine accomplishing that would work something like as follows:  \n  \nA distributed software client, let's call it Pythia, is downloaded and run by anyone who wants to be an oracle or call upon the results of existing oracles.  Distributed computing supplies the processing power to aggregate and record oracle performance.  \n  \nPythia essentially has it's own blockchain which can hold questions ('Who won the Yankees game last night?') conditions and the like.  Each address is an oracle, and whomever has a key to that oracle can submit an answer to any questions/conditions submitted on the chain.  Timing and dates are programmed into the initial question.    Each oracle's reports are also recorded into the chain, as is their accuracy.  \n  \nKnowing how to rate the oracles (did they get it right or wrong?) is a function of wisdom of crowds.  The more oracles that report an outcome (Yankees won) the more that outcome calcifies in score and the blockchain comes to view it as a true outcome.  \n  \nContract-makers are given a slew of options.  They can choose single oracles, an average of specific multiple oracles, and average of all oracles who weighed in, and weighted combos of all the above.  When setting the contract they can require that both parties approve the oracle-reported outcome or that a certain percentage of oracles reporting an outcome can over-ride the need for both parties to sign off.  \n  \nOracles would gain reputation (for addresses in their control) by being correct, by being specifically requested to weigh in on questions/contracts, and for the amount of hours they contributed to the system.  The system, I suppose, would need to generate tokens as awards.  Ideally these would be bitcoins.  You'd pay for oracles with bitcoins and you'd get paid in bitcoins for being an oracle.  \n   \nNot sure if that part would work though.  It may need to be a token of its own that can be traded for bitcoin (much as I hate to generate *another* altcoin).  Oracles could receive minor amounts of tokens for being right on things they weighed in on but weren't invited, and more on contracts in which they were requested specifically.  \n  \nYou could also set up 'burn addresses' tied to a specific API.  So an address that can be set up once to ping the ESPN API and then would forever deliver the results it reported (until ESPN changed their API).  In this way, you could have trusted addresses pulling from centrally-controlled sources.  If the sources die, the addresses become not useful.  If the sources modify, then new burn API addresses would need to be set up.  \n  \nI guess the part that I have trouble working out in my mind is how the bitcoins (or Pythia coins) are stored while a contract is undetermined.  Is it just an address with with a smart contract on it that needs two keys to create and then once implemented can never be changed?  It can only pay out or return funds if required thresholds aren't met.   \n  \nWithout something like this, I just don't see how decentralized smart contracts can be all that useful.  They will always have to require a trusted 3rd party.  It would definitely be interesting though.  It would crystallize on a version of history, forever unchanged.  Probably end up with a massive chain eventually too, but people could run nodes that only have history going back so far.  People with more resources could run the full histories for posterity.

That\'s why Apple, IBM, Google and many many other corporations profit based on software that anyone can copy.\n\nSmart contracts and oracles both ultimately have outputs from the outside world. The only difference is how trust is managed.\n\n"Parasite oracles" are both inevitable and worth less than Official Monopoly Oracles. I can subscribe to your oracle and copy the data to my own oracle. You cannot stop that, and if nobody is trying to do it your data is not worth as much as you think. But at the same time anyone using my parasite oracle is aware that I\'m copying the data from you. I\'ve already shown I\'m less than entirely trustworthy. Now, what was the value of an oracle again?\n\nOnce we separate out the social and technical issues, both oracles and smart contracts can benefit from and suffer from copying (reduced revenue/reduced costs) and reputation (trust is value).

Vsauce made a recent video on [Zipf's Law](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCn8zs912OE). Summed up, there is a natural trend across many elements that reflect a substantially uneven distribution. In terms of Bitcoin distribution, I of course am jealous that a single entity holds 7% of all Bitcoins, but the finite-ness of Bitcoin makes it okay. If they spend those Bitcoins, that percentage will go down and the wealth distribute through the economy. If they don't spend those Bitcoins, holding them props the price up by creating an artificially restricted supply.  Bitcoin holders of course do not like to see substantial price drops and loss of purchasing power, but many of us from the Western world have been spoiled with the relative stability of the US Dollar.

I can go to the judge, show him my block, and since they weren\'t supposed to have two sibling blocks, ever, I\'ll get my money since they messed with the chain.\n\nIt\'s no different than if they gave me a digitally signed receipt saying "you gave us money", only that it\'s easier to audit when a lot of transactions happen.\n\nIt\'s a blockchain.

If the US or China, or even a private organization like a large bank wanted to attack Bitcoin they could easily do so. Even if Bitcoin switched mining algos every time it was attacked it would just be a war of attrition, and it won't take long before it's reduced to a shell of its former self. It's not like enough people are going to band together and use their own money to attempt to outspend a state, large bank, or similar organization.\n\nClosing bank accounts or refusing service doesn't really qualify for 'fighting' in my opinion. That's gone on fairly consistently more or less for years now. Most of the time it's just because there hasn't been any regulatory guidance, so they just take the conservative route. Not that  I think that there should necessarily be more regulation or anything, but when there's a point where banks are confident they can legally deal with Bitcoin and make money at it they will.

': 3, "doesn't seem like it, though they are pretty lame, I wonder if the photographer got paid?": 0, 'I guess it depends on what you mean by rights.\n\nThere are negative and positive rights. I don\'t know if you\'re familiar with them or not, so I\'ll just briefly explain them. If you are, then please don\'t be offended.\n\nA positive right is something that obliges action from other people on an individual\'s behalf; it\'s something that enslaves the person who is doing the action. If, for example, you believe a person has a RIGHT to an education, that is a positive right, and obliges others to act in order for that to happen. It actually enslaves others in order for it to happen.\n\nA negative right, on the other hand, simply obliges others to refrain from acting. Drinking a 64 oz soda in New York is a negative right. The only thing required from others in relation to that right is that people refrain from taking any action to restrict it. The negative right isn\'t about others, but about the person who has the right, but it\'s worth noting that negative rights liberate others to do other things, whereas positive rights enslave them. \n\nThe moral being from this is that negative rights are legitimate and positive rights are illegitimate. Others might not agree, but that\'s my contention.\n\nAccording to this, the idea of having a bank account being a right would make it a positive right. It doesn\'t require that others refrain from action to allow you to have a bank account, it obliges and enslaves others to make that happen for you. In the case of the article, the positive right to have a bank account enslaves the bank owners (who we know are not necessarily always good guys, but that\'s irrelevant) to provide a service to someone. It\'s bad enough to have the decision of who you will do business with controlled by someone else, but when you are then forced to do business with someone that by doing so will spell your doom, that is worse. \n\nDon\'t get me wrong. I want the banks to go away. But it\'s not appropriate to expect them to be the agents of their own undoing. \n\nIn addition, if bitcoin needs propping by the current system, and laws made that make it so they can have bank accounts too etc., then to me, that\'s a failed business model. I don\'t believe that Bitcoin companies NEED bank accounts to survive. One of the salient benefits of Bitcoin is that you don\'t need a bank account. It is certainly inconvenient. But, necessity is the mother of invention, and it\'s probably healthy that bitcoin companies be forced to come up with alternate solutions than use conventional banking for their business. \n\nEven in the US you can have legal problems for having too much cash on hand. There are countless examples of being pulled over for whatever reason, having your vehicle searched, and then having your money confiscated and you rarely, if ever, get any of it back. \n\nBut implying that that means that the government demands you have a bank account is a stretch. Even if we accept that premise, just because a government demands something, that doesn\'t mean it\'s a right. Law does not equate morality or ethics. Just because something is legal or illegal doesn\'t automatically bestow upon it some sort of morality. \n\nThe thing is, pursuing State-sponsored legitimacy (when you said "either acknowledge Bitcoin and alternative payment systems as legal or make having a bank account a civil right) isn\'t the solution for bank account. State-sponsored legitimacy will actually hurt bitcoin. It allows for state regulation, it allows for easier taxation, it allows for government fees, and it allows the state to control it. All those things will make transaction costs go up, will reduce the pseudo-anonymity (though hopefully someday full anonymity), and ruins it as a method for resisting the government through counter-economies etc. \n\nGovernments can\'t REALLY prevent people from using bitcoin, by its nature. I appreciate and agree with your frustration about the supposed catch-22 of either making it legit or making having a bank account a right. I say though, that that\'s a false choice. Bitcoin doesn\'t need the State to make it legitimate, and it certainly doesn\'t need bank accounts. Look at Coinbase. They\'ve become largely mainstream and have given in to governments about regulations etc. But they now hold cash as well as bitcoin. That means the solution is there and available with someone with the wherewithal and inclination to make it happen. I don\'t have it, I\'m more of a philosophical and casual follower of bitcoin than a power user, but I still think I\'m right, ha. ;)': 1, "For the love of God do not list igot as an exchange.

BLC had a default rate of 35% for me. BTCJam so far has a default rate of 16%. BLC provides better statistics and I can clearly see that I will lose money to the tune of 20%. BTCJam however has less telling statistics which I consider to be borderline deception. The NAR metric they use starts out extremely high (250%) and rapidly drops with every default. I now stand at 50% for BTC loans and 20% for USD denominated loans, but they continue to drop with every default. Who knows where I will stand after 12 months.\n\nSome time ago BTCJam posted an estimation of ROI for their autoinvest feature and they provided an expected APR metric. Why can't they provide the same metric for their other loans? I'm not a finance guru and I don't understand these metrics very well but it seems like they could come together and calculate an expected APR with honest expectations for defaults and such.\n\nBLC on the other hand flaunts their low default rate but what they don't tell you is that a lot of their loans are 'reputation loans' wherein the borrower cannot even pull the money out so it isn't even a true loan. BLC lowers their overall default rate this way and it is a form of deception.\n\nI have stopped lending money on both sites for now but I have not abandoned hope completely.\n\nBoth websites are rapidly changing their polices in an attempt to improve the system as a whole and I believe they may actually work in the future.\n\nWhen I get to six months I will write a more formal review.": 1, 'Hi,\nI\'m the CEO of BitLendingClub and I\'m here to tell you a bit more about P2P lending. Mooncake\'s experience is not far from what we\'ve seen on the platform, but I\'d like to provide a bit of context.  First and foremost: trying to "mimic" BTCJam\'s auto-invest on our platform will not work, they do a lot more than just to put your money in highly rated loans. We\'ll get into the details in a bit, but here is the big picture:\n\n**Default Rates vs ROI**  \nHaving a high default rate does not necessarily mean that the lenders are losing money. Stu Lutsman is one of the experienced lenders and he\'s [posted an ROI of 2.53% for August](http://p2plendingexpert.com/stus-portfolio-report-august-2015/) and the average default rate for the month is 9.65%. In addition, I would like to compare the performance with the first years of LendingClub and Propsper:\n\n1. Propser experienced 26% default rates in the first 2 years, which lead to about -4.67% ROI: http://www.lendacademy.com/a-look-back-at-prosper-1-0-how-relevant-are-the-numbers/  \n2. LendingClub experienced 14.8% default rates in the first year, with -3.44% ROI: https://www.nsrplatform.com/#!/  \n\nHow do P2P platforms turn high default rates into profit, or not such a horrible loss? The answer is risk-based pricing and solid underwriting procedures. When we first started BitLendingClub, we had the optimistic idea that the free market is the best. Many people in the Bitcoin community, as well as our own community, also believe that we should let the free market decide as much as possible. Over time, the "smart" lenders will be profitable, the "not-so-smart" lenders will lose some cash, the good borrowers will be rewarded, the bad borrowers will be publicly shamed and everybody will be happy. Unfortunately, that\'s not how it works, just ask Chris Larsen from Prosper: https://www.quora.com/Chris-Larsen\n\n**The Free Market**  \nThe truth is that if we want to have a truly free-market platform, then **all** of the information necessary to judge the risk with the loan should be available to the lenders. However, much of the information actually necessary to calculate the risk is extremely private. So we, as a platform, have had to play the arbiter and determine which information should be private, which should be public and how to manage it. But suppose that we do have the perfect balance, the lenders are still going to be left with an overwhelming amount of information. We have over 1600 borrowers, each one having more than 40 properties and more than 8,000 loans. That\'s a matrix of more than 51 million data points! The average lender simply doesn\'t have the time or the means to analyze that much data.  \n\n**Bitcoin Volatility**  \nThe best way to avoid the Bitcoin volatility is to use the block-chain as a "value transport layer", which means denominating the loans in fiat, keeping the lender\'s funds in fiat and only converting to Bitcoin when a transfer is necessary. That\'s not a very popular thing in the Bitcoin space, but read the next section why this method of lending is going to be a huge positive for Bitcoin.\n\n**If it\'s so bad, then why do you still run your platform?**  \nOur platform was seeing default rates in excess of 16%, sometimes as high as 30%, before March. Since then, we\'ve made some major strides in improving our screening procedures ([recently busted over 100 borrowers from an MLM scheme](http://forum.bitlendingclub.com/index.php?threads/a-great-ponzi-within-blc.1657/#post-6366) that spanned Venezuela, the Dominican Republic and Mexico) and we\'ve brought it down to about 8% on average. With those rates, we\'re seeing an average ROI of about -2%, which is slightly better than the early days of Propser and LendingClub. In addition, we\'re working on further improving the credit scoring, risk-based pricing, and we\'re currently testing auto-invest (which has had extremely promising results). As I mentioned in the previous paragraph: Bitcoin as a value transport layer means that we can fund mainstream loans. This, in term means that if we were to have the necessary market penetration within the developing countries, Bitcoin based P2P lenders would have funded $5 billion in loans this year alone, which would have generated over $20 billion in liquidity on the market. That\'s without factoring the exponential growth of marketplace lending! **I believe that this is one of the killer apps for Bitcoin and I think we can make it work!**': 2, "You mean the lendee? I guess stocks would work, but you're gambling on their future price.

End customers have the ability to withdraw their funds and disappear which is a risk that is difficult to control.\n\nI set up [Magnr Savings](https://magnr.com) as a closed-loop ecosystem where savers who want to earn interest of their Bitcoins can do so in a safer, more risk-controlled environment. Interest revenue is generated from Magnr Trading (formerly BTC.sx). Because borrowers are not able to withdraw funds, we can ensure defaults from clients disappearing is not a problem. The interest rate offered reflects the lower risk however please bear in mind that ANY service which pays interest, even in the fiat banking world, only does so because there is risk (look up what happened in Greece and Cyprus with depositor funds).\n\nYes, that was a plug for Magnr, but here's some free advice, if you do not want *ANY risk of loss*, my best recommendation is to keep your bitcoins safe on your own hardware, offline backup or brain wallet etc. That way you can be entirely responsible for the risks you take with your own bitcoins.\n\nContrary to popular belief, the business of banking and finance is about risk, not about money.

The reason why liquidation works btw is because the value of the shares is usually considered to be 50% of the market value for margin purposes whereas the resultant fiat is 100%.\n\nI mention this because with multiple currencies shifting in value, it seems to me that margin loans is really complicated. Why would turning BTC into dollars be preferred over keeping it in BTC? The answer I guess would be in this simple case because it is dollars that were borrowed and that is what needs to be paid back but I can imagine more complex situations.\n\nIn the stock market, not all shares are equally marginable and the marginability is based on various factors which change all the time. I think at one time shares trading below 5 bucks could not be borrowed against which as a rule of thumb sounds okay but then the internet bubble came along and we saw that just because a stock is trading for 100 bucks one day doesn't mean it won't be worth 5 bucks a week later.

I haven't used any of them so I can't recommend any.  I just wanted to warn you that many of them are ponzi schemes (but not all), so just be careful.": 1, "The thing that you are missing is that mining is like predictable luck.  Let me illustrate with my own hardware.  I have 3 AntMiner S3's.  If I were to mine solo on each one independently, luck is predictable in that after a few years I might mine a single block between them.  However, if I tell them to join a mining pool (AntPool, p2pool, you can look up others) then the pool's total hashpower dictates how often it gets lucky and mints a new bitcoin block.  Most pools worth joining get a new bitcoin block every few days to every hour or so, depending on their hashpower.  So you get a piece of a bitcoin block more regularly.  Due to the way the math on luck in the bitcoin sphere works, you'll seriously get the same amount (roughly, averaged out) regardless of the pool you join.  Now if a pool is unreliable, has network outages, etc, you'll want to find a more reliable and less latency between you and the pool scenario, but that's just your personal choice details.  How frequently does a pool get a block minted should rougly equal how your payout gets divided out.  For 3 AntMiner S3's I own which tally roughly 900GH .. I get roughly 0.01btc per day.  If you have cheap (or paid for electricity like in some apartments) you can still get an antminer S5 and consider the math and get your money back in a few months, and turn a profit after that.  Please do your research and understand that your hardware cannot fail, your electric cannot go up in price, BTC cannot go down in price, BTC cannot half, difficulty cannot go up, or your math needs redone.  Minting bitcoin at home is indeed rolling the dice in terms of profit vs loss.  Large scale operations can invest lots of money and have more of a profit margin in volume.

We just hope that there is no collusion at that point?": 1, 'Thanks!': 1, "Yeah, basically we hope there's no collusion, that no malicious entity or group controls 51% or more of the hashpower, that there are lots of competing mining companies.  This is a very old concern that Satoshi talked about in the white paper itself.": 2, 'What language?': 2, '> What exactly is "halving" and what does it mean for BTC over the long term?\n\nBitcoin works because every participant (fully validating node) is enforcing a set of rules - consensus rules - onto everything that passes through the network. Rules like \'the block hash must be lower than a set difficulty in order to be valid\', \'a transaction cannot spend an output that does not exist\', \'a transaction cannot have a higher aggregate output amount than its aggregate inputs\', \'a transaction\'s embedded script must, when executed, return true and not throw an error\', and so on.\n\nOne of these rules, is that every 210 000 blocks, the amount of bitcoins the miner of a block may reward themselves must be halved.\n\nBack when the genesis block was created, the reward was 50 bitcoin for each block that a miner would generate. Approximately 4 years later, when the 210 000th block was generated, this reward was halved to the current 25 bitcoin, and in just a little over 40 000 blocks, the 420 000th block will be generated, at which point the reward will, again, be halved to 12.5 bitcoin.\n\nThis reward halving schedule (along with the other consensus rules, like no double spends) is the reason bitcoins are a scarce digital commodity, it is the reason bitcoin has value in the first place. It is modeled much like the way gold is being shoveled out of the ground - this, too, happens at a somewhat predictable rate that is ever-lowering. Gold also has value primarily because it is a scarce commodity.\n\n> What is "block size" in practical terms, what does it mean to the layman who isn\'t a miner, if anything? Why is there a controversy over it?\n\nThe block size *limit* is another consensus rule. A block is generated every 10 minutes on average, and that block may - currently - not be larger than 1 megabyte in size. This rule was put in place years ago in order to prevent spam; there was some worry that blocks could become arbitrarily large, which would disallow new participants from validating the system. We are now running into this limit for what appear to be legitimate reasons: the network has grown such that a 1MB block size no longer prevents spam, but presumably prevents legitimate growth. The controversy is about a way to change this limit into something more appropriate, and everyone disagrees over the best way to do this.\n\nIt\'s hard to come to consensus, because the consensus rules we all agree with are the reason bitcoin works the way it does in the first place: we need to all be in agreement in order to change something, and getting to a place where we all agree is not easy. But we\'re getting there.\n\n> how do you report investments in / earnings from Bitcoin in your taxes?\n\nDepends on where you\'re from.

When a share IS found that is high enough difficulty, the pool submits it to the network, other miners and nodes verify it, it becomes a bitcoin block, the coinbase pays the block reward to the pool and the pool distributes the block reward fairly to its miners (usually taking a fee, maybe 1% or so) by how many shares each miner worker had contributed to the pool during the round.

I don't like the pool situation.  and I make sure to use a smaller pool in any case so that I'm not contributing to the centralization problem, but this is exactly what happened to me as well, and I go with a pool for these exact same reasons.\n\nIt took some effort getting my miner ready. I hate ubuntu, and prefer Arch/Manjaro, but getting Eth/Geth installed on that distro is just shy of impossible because of some missing and incompatible compile libraries..., so after installing ubuntu just to mine a little on the side, and then getting it installed and compiled, I wasn't about to mess around with it.  After 4 days of no blocks I gave up and went to Ethereumpool. They are around 4 GH/s so not a giant pool by any means so I don't feel too bad about the decision.  \n\nOnce the clients and nodes are a little more stable, and I am not needing to update every other day, I may change my mind and set up a node but I still don't understand why I had so much variance with 50 Mh/s and 4 days with no blocks...": 3, '[deleted]': 5, 'During their test chain I believe they saw massive incentive problems where higher hashrate pools received a significantly inequitable chunk of blocks owing to progress effects from the very short interblock interval.': 19, "Actually they did tinker with non-outsourceable puzzle for a while.

Vitalik himself said that PoW is just a placeholder until PoS is in place, and if he were to start over he would just use SHA3 as a PoW. Which is quite sad since I'm leaning towards PoW myself.\n\nPersonally I think most of the miner in the pool never tried doing solo mining because from my experience it is actually far more profitable to solo mine.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/3inyxx/question_how_is_possible_to_create_a_single/cuicaba\n\n(other user with similar experience)": 3, '[removed]': 1, "Yup.\n\n* premine issues\n* instamine in first day as much as the rest of the month\n* difficult mining instructions for starters\n* some shady miner keeps his hashrate at 40% of the total, every day\n*  price drops constantly until Xmas\n* bugs requiring hard forks to fix\n\nOh if you were not surprised by this, wait until you get the PoS shenanigans.

The thing is at the test chain's stress test they put targeting part of Bitcoin's equivalent of blocksize limit (gas limit) at a really large number (miner vote on valid gas limit, I think they are hitting somewhere around 20-25 tx/s at some part of the test). Most miner doesn't bother to set soft size limit, much less attempt to target lower gas limit, because it is a stress test after all (and the fact that codebase is in Go probably doesn't help).

It gives me greater confidence seeing my balance on a pool slowly go up rather than seeing no block being solved for days and wondering if somethings wrong with my config, or if I need another software update, which is done pretty often.\n\nEdit: there's basically no one-click and run way to begin mining it.  Depending on your platform, simply getting the miner compiled/installed and hashing at its full potential is a feat in itself.  Just Google some of the tutorials available online from different people with different OSs, it's all over the place.  With Bitcoin/clonecoins all I did was made sure I had AMD drivers, download the sgminer binary, copy someone else's config that seems to work for them that had the same hardware as me, and away I went.
