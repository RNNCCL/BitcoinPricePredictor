Sure, people might not **want** to lower their nominal prices in a world where the currency is gaining value (e.g. a Bitcoin world), but guess what? They will **absolutely** do it anyway when they realize they\'re not selling their labor or goods due to the high prices they are asking for. We actually see this happen in some sectors, like technology. Computers and other things not only get cheaper in real terms, but nominally as well!

The Austrian School is unique in that it is understood that economics is nothing like a physical science (e.g. physics) where hypotheses can be tested. There are no real experiments in economics because you **cannot** set up controlled experiments.

Also (and I\'m not sure if this was because of gold backing or not) a (the?) leading explanation of the Great Depression was an excessively restricted money supply.  \n\nIf all that is true (others will maybe know better), then we have a demonstration of the principle that insufficient monetary expansion causes recession.  For what its worth this is what most pro macroeconomists think and a lot of them are very smart.  I\'m not one to accept someone\'s arguments just  because of who they are, or their title, but they do have arguments.  \n\nYou are right to say this is determined by the individual level, and we can use game theory to understand it (still just arithmetic imho).  I haven\'t got a detailed proof of this, but it comes to mind that it will be rational for individuals to, for instance, collude to maintain high wages (through collective bargaining) even though this may be worse for society overall.  So my argument would certainly be based on the premise that we should consider how individuals act.\n\nWhich brings me to your last question of how this would be chosen.

Nodes, or whoever (individuals), would effectively vote on a proposal to implement an expansionary monetary formula.  If 51% agree, it happens.  First past the post democracy.

This is the phenomenon of "sticky prices" (to be  more specific, prices are "sticky downwards").\n\nHere\'s why it is a problem.  Suppose you have a fixed supply of money (a certain number of $ or coins).  But then the economy grows.  More transactions, and the economy needs more currency units to cover them.  People literally will not have enough units to buy the goods and services they want at their current prices.  The solution to this is that the exchange rate between the currency unit and the good must reduce, so now there are enough units to cover all the transactions.  Deflation.  This is fine, as long as everyone goes along with it.  It should make no difference at all - everyone still pays and gets the same in real terms.  The nominal price of something doesn\'t matter, its what you can get with it that counts.    \n\nProblem is, ppl don\'t see it that way.  Human nature.  And they may be bound into contracts that specified a nominal price.  In particular, labour / unions would resist any fall in nominal wages - even though it may mean no change in real wages.  If people resist a fall in nominal prices, there are not enough currency units to cover all the purchases people want to make - so they don\'t get made.  All the stuff people were selling cannot be bought, just because there aren\'t enough currency units (whose number is set by us, society). You get unemployment, recession, depression.  The full resources of the economy are not  being used - just because of the price level, which is in fact wholly arbitrary.  This can be massively costly and cause misery -  entirely unnecessarily.\n\nThis is one reason genuinely well-intentioned Govts always aim for a bit of inflation - to accommodate growth in the economy without causing recession.\n\nSo when mainstream economists look at bitcoin this is what they see.  They think this is ridiculous, a fixed money supply is a recipe for disaster, it will lock the economy into depression - these people can have no idea what they are talking about.\n\nFor me - a paid up believer in bitcoin, and an economist - this is the biggest question  whose answer is not widely discussed.  I\'ve been thru all the rest - security, energy of mining,  altcoins - and come to understand all that is OK.  There is an answer to this question - though one which many might not like.  To be the currency of the global economy (which I believe it can), bitcoin will have to programme some sort of permanent monetary expansion  (unless human nature - the basis of stick prices - changes).  If it doesn\'t, its use will fix the world into a permanent depression.  Which means the world will choose to use something else, which has the correct monetary formula (or whatever Andreas said).\n\nEdit: paragraph spacing': 5, "There's a reason that food containers are being redesigned for less content at the same price *(USA)*:\n\nhttp://consumerist.com/category/grocery-shrink-ray/\n\nJust the tip of the inflationary iceberg...": 2, "That's the symptom of inflation, not the cause.": 1, 'Coincidentally, I happened to watch the Khan Academy videos on inflation only yesterday.

The vanilla code already attempts to ignore (and thereby mitigate) these kind of attacks[1]. The blacklist feature is just an admittedly ugly hack to improve the reliability of the detection based on known factors - it is unsuitable for the reference code because it is ugly, but until a better solution is implemented, it is safe and appropriate for production use. A perfect long-term solution to these attacks is impractical (similar to other malware filtering) since it is an "arms race", and this interim solution works reliably for now without affecting Bitcoin users negatively (which is a risk for more complex solutions, that they could trigger false positives on legitimate traffic). It certainly does not harm the Bitcoin consensus system in any way, as the patchset is carefully maintained to not affect that code at all.\n\nThe "address reuse" patch Sarah makes reference could be one of two things, neither of which are included in my patchset due to minor technical issues during testing. In any case, the change is in fact quite UNcontroversial (I believe there is unanimous agreement among Bitcoin experts that it is a good idea), and is likely to make its way into the vanilla codebase.\n\nFinally, please note that the quotes xiando posted to "support" his position are taken out of context.

Lots of (more) popular services and merchants use Bitcoin just fine without creating a DDoS attack on the network. Their business model is also equally possible (and in fact easier to implement) without creating such an attack. You can argue intentions all you like, but the fact is that objectively, that is what they are doing.\n\nIf you disagree, or want to help them attack the network, you are free to turn off the USE flag. You can also remove the vanilla filtering by dropping a patch in /etc/portage/patches.\n\nLuke-Jr 2014-10-06 18:42:30 UTC\nTo ensure users are aware of the USE flag, how about adding something like this?\n\neinfo Two flavours of Bitcoin Core are available in Gentoo, depending on the \'ljr\' USE flag.\neinfo With USE=ljr (default), you will get a number of improvements by Luke Dashjr. This includes (among many other things) a blacklist-based spam filter which extends the vanilla spam filtering to explicitly match for known attacks on the Bitcoin network.\neinfo If you build with USE=-ljr, you will get the vanilla code as released upstream. This is not as effective in filtering spam, and is not appropriate for mining, but has had more review and testing.\n\nLuke-Jr 2014-10-07 00:14:03 UTC\n(In reply to xiando from comment #23)\n> I guess the Gentoo policy will be that it is alright for a payment network\n> to accept a transaction fee for a service without delivering said service\n> because someone decided to blacklisting them for using this service. :)\n\nTotal non-argument. Nodes which do not relay or mine transactions do not collect the fee offered for them. More notably, nodes which *do* relay them still do not collect the fee for them. Finally, nodes which are burdened by them, do not collect the fee for them. The fee is only collected by the miner who puts them in a block, by his free market choice to do so. Fees exist to discourage spam, not to compensate for the costs of the transaction.\n\n> 1) My practice of creating transactions add cruft to the blackchain and\n> affects the future efficiency of all bitcoin nodes because this transaction\n> is then stored in the blockchain (which is how Bitcoin works).\n\nAlso a non-argument. The blockchain was created for financial transactions. That doesn\'t mean it\'s acceptable or equivalent to use it for other purposes such as spammy messaging, especially when such abuses make legitimate use more difficult and/or costly.

There is no benefit.\n\n1. Use of a blockchain-like chain of title would not allow fraudulent transactions to be reversed without some sort of newly defined consensus mechanism.  That consensus mechanism would, in the end, either look a lot like our current court system or would be an unresolvable anarchy -- your domain gets stolen, ha-ha you should have protected yourself better.  (That\'s what we see here now when someone\'s computer gets infected by bitcoin-stealing malware.)\n\n2. Almost as bad -- you lose/forget the private key for your domain, ha-ha you are locked out of it permanently.  A blockchain system would thus create a completely new problem for domain registrants.  Or do we create a consensus mechanism that allows people to fix that?  If so, then how do we guard against fraud?  (And see #1 for why fraud isn\'t fixed.)\n\n3. Domains are currently leased, not sold.  You buy a domain for a fixed term, and get first shot at renewing that lease every time it ends.  I don\'t happen to like it, but that\'s how the system evolved back when it was decided to charge for registrations.  (Anyone else remember when they were all free?)  So a mechanism would have to be created to revert the domain to being unregistered when the registration expires.  (Probably easy, and it would be better than the existing ridiculousness about private auctions by registrars followed by the "drop list" and open registration.  This could also trivially be done in the existing system, however, just by Verisign dictating a new policy to its registrars.)\n\n4. Even if some sort of consensus mechanism could be developed, akin to the concept of a shared public ledger, there are genuine issues of law that govern domain name ownership.  I disagree with many of the trademark issues that have forced their way into domain agreements (UDRP), but in the case I mentioned, it was a matter of contract, and the other party breached the contract.  The consensus mechanism would therefore have to be set up to abide by court decisions, at the very least.\n\n5. A blockchain based system doesn\'t actually add anything useful.  Unlike Bitcoin, domain names are fairly static in terms of ownership and transfers are straightforward.\n\n6. The existing power structure is not going to give up control, and even if it did, the new power structure would not be any better.  One of the actual positives of American control is that they are not petty, spiteful, malicious, and constantly butthurt.  Imagine China getting 51% of the hashing power on such a system.  Do you think they would act benignly?  I don\'t, and their record with the Great Firewall and other censorship, demanding user information of Google accounts to go after dissidents, and cyberespionage against foreign financial and defense firms all say the same.  Putin\'s Russia?

Domain names are treated as personal property.  Domain names have a central repository at the registry that controls the TLD extension under which the domain name is issued.  For example, .com domains are "located", for legal purposes, in Virginia, where Verisign runs the .com registry.\n\nIssues with domain name theft by third parties, and "slamming" between registrars so that they can leech fees, are readily solvable through corporate policies at Verisign that would then be enforced on registries doing business through Verisign, and through the regular legal process.  Examples are authentication of ownership, delay of any transfer that looks suspicious (such as for domains that are currently not parked), and terminating contracts for registrars that try to hijack domains from other registrars.  They do some of this already, but not enough.\n\nYes, the legal process for returning ownership after a case of fraud is complicated and costly.

So, holders of bitcoin need to be aware that if any of these other holders make a sudden move, it will cause a huge impact to them, just as we saw happen in the last week.\n \nThis applies to individual investors, just an added thing to think about. Institutional investors (true institutions, with investment committees and such - endowments, pensions, hedge funds), I\'d expect that this would all come up during the course of their due diligence.\n\nAs for the impact of this against the potential for a nation adopting BTC as their official currency, again, bear whale type fears - 99,000 people (the current "top 10%") own 90% of the bitcoins currently in existence, what nation would want to base the ability to meet their budgets\' obligations, let alone worry about the effects that wild swings could have on the budgets of their citizens.\n\nNation X starts the year with 800,000 BTC, valued at $1,000 apiece.

Then, a few of bitcoins top 1% come along and pull bear whale maneuvers, not being malicious, just being anxious and wanting to convert their coins to cash NOW, and Bitcoin falls to $500; now the country can\'t meet their budgetary obligations.\n\nYes, they\'re exposed to the actions of others no matter what currency choice they make, any other currencies holdings are spread among multitudes more people.

The IRS made a ruling that it should be treated like property, which makes sense in certain circumstances.  For example if you buy bitcoin with FIAT as an investment then sell it for FIAT, you probably should pay capital gains tax the same as those who trade and invest in currencies like the Euro.  But when using the Euro as a currency to buy goods and services there would be no tax obligation.  \n\nThe IRS has admitted however that bitcoin can sometimes act like property, but also that it can act like a currency.  From the IRS notice: "In some environments, virtual currency operates like \xe2\x80\x9creal\xe2\x80\x9d currency \xe2\x80\x94 i.e., the coin and paper money of the United States or of any other country that is designated as legal tender, circulates, and is customarily used and accepted as a medium of exchange in the country of issuance \xe2\x80\x94 but it does not have legal tender status in any jurisdiction." (http://www.coindesk.com/internal-revenue-service-treat-digital-currencies-property/)\n\nSo they are admitting bitcoin acts like a real currency at times.  But they are saying since bitcoin is not yet legal tender in any country that they want to call it property instead of currency.  If bitcoin was adopted as legal tender in some tiny country then the argument for bitcoin as currency would be made even stronger.\n\nAlthough the IRS claims that because bitcoin is not legal tender in any country that it is property and not currency, these claims are not backed by much, and may not hold up in court.  Also congress has not passed any laws that make this the case.  All we have is a statement from the IRS. Statements from the IRS are not absolute truths.  If one day some tiny country makes bitcoin legal tender, then according to the IRS statement there will be no tax obligation for buying goods with bitcoin.\n\n': 1, "1. The IRS considers it property, so it is taxed like any other capital asset, and is subject to capital gains taxes.\n2. When you buy Bitcoins, keep track of what you bought, when and for how much. You'll need this when you sell/spend.\n3. If all you have done is bought some Bitcoins, you don't need to do anything. You don't have to declare them, you don't owe any taxes.\n4. When you sell Bitcoins, you need to work out any potential gains/losses you made. This is the USD you got from selling, less the cost of those coins (from 2) and also less any fees you paid.\n5. Any sales generate a potential tax liability in the year that you do the sell. So if you sold today, you will have to include it on your tax forms for 2014 that you file in April 2015.\n6. It's always a good idea to estimate the taxes you owe when selling and put that portion aside, so you have it come April.\n7. For tax purposes, spending is no different than selling. The USD you make when spend is the fair value of the thing you are buying. So you need to keep a track of any spending, i.e. date, the USD value, amount of coins.\n8. You include all your gains/losses, from spending or selling, in Schedule D of your 1040.\n9. Gains are split into long-term and short-term. Long-term is when you owned the coin (or part) that you spent for more than a year.\n10. The amount of tax depends on your circumstances and other income. Long-term gains are taxed at either 0%, 15% or 20%. So, for example, if you are single and earned less than $36,900 elsewhere, you'll pay 0%. Short-term gains are taxed like normal income, so whatever your rate is from all your combined income.\n\nFree free to ask if you have any other questions.\n\nI run [bitcointaxes.info](https://bitcointaxes.info) that can help work out taxes.\n\nedit: couldn't write that much without at least one typo :)": 2, 'So essentially, if i just have and hold them, then they never realize value so they are non issue.

Sneaking a blacklist into a larger patch, not documenting it, turning it on by default, and refusing to change it when challenged on it are all signs of shenanigans and abuse of power on the part of luke-jr.\n\nI\'m glad he came around to eventually reverse his position and apologize.\n': 3, 'That would be awesome :)': 1, 'Maybe bearwhale returns at weekend ?': 1, "Just the other day I saw a post saying /r/Bitcoin was boring.

I chose WU as a comparison because that is one of the features bitcoin offers but nowhere near the potential of what Bitcoins place could be. Bitcoin having a relatively small global market penetration in a large number of industries, or a large market penetration in even just a few key industries would take the value of a coin much much higher. I and others believe that the pure convenience of moving any sum of money with such ease will lead to a network effect where anyone dealing with fiat currency is also dealing with cryptocurrency because of the decided advantages they offer. \n\n>Why is btc not better stable at a price like now than it is making everyone wonder what the price will do next.\n\nMarkets don't work like this. We can't simply say 300 is a fair price and the market should be reasonable and value it at or around 300. You can't stop speculation. There are people who think Bitcoin will be worth $10,000 a coin (and higher) and there are people who think Bitcoin is going to fail catastrophically and the market in effect finds a balance between these parties and everyone in between and that's where you get your market price. When things happen that change the fundamentals or even the perception of the fundamentals, there are violent swings as the market tries to find a more accurate equilibrium between all the forces at play.

Yes, what I say comes across to people here as a "holier than thou" preacher\'s sermon because I ask questions.  \n\n\n>I and others believe that the pure convenience of moving any sum of money with such ease will lead to a network effect where anyone dealing with fiat currency is also dealing with cryptocurrency because of the decided advantages they offer.\n\n> This is why bitcoin spikes and dumps the way it does and I can\'t see any reason to believe that this process will just stop, especially not at the current valuation.\n\nFully in agreement here on volatility not stopping any time soon. Big picture framework? Yep, you\'re right. Markets don\'t work like that.\n\nThank you for *disagreeing with a response*. It\'s great we can disagree on this like adults and everyone is better for it. Is it true that reasonable discussions aren\'t here any more? \n\n>What do you mean lack of development skills? The only thing that \'to da moon\' thinking (I used the term in my OP because its in the title) is really doing is annoying people. Bitcoin won\'t be made or broken based on something so trivial.\n\nI\'ll clarify/modify that a bit; the "to the moon" mentality is extending the development time at the least, and at worst could do much worse. A few hypothetical questions and you tell me how likely or unlikely you think it\'ll be:\n\n1. How many developers do you think there are representing the huge community/userbase spending and mining Bitcoin? So % or actual numbers, either is fine...\n2. When journalists (WSJ, FT, Fox, Time) are verbally abused by community members because of their opinion and are called incompetent, how do you think that weighs on Bitcoin for negative press and possible withholding of positive press in future?  \n3. Development is hampered and stretched over longer time periods from total lack of community input. Whilst people complain about the bearwhale or worry about the price, nobody is having discussions about anything. So how do you get input for development when no one answers questions? \n4.

This is the part most miss when they advocate paper wallets.\n\nThe best method I've seen is to sweep with Mycelium:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pDSzOiFgIk\n\nHowever, there are at least two problems:\n\n1. Change is returned to the paper wallet. This is bad for privacy and it's bad for security. All transactions flow through a single address, making it easy to link them together. Should the private key become compromised, you lose everything.\n2. There's no good way to determine whether your Android has been infected with malware. Such malware could, for example, grab your private key, or alter the receiving or change addresses for the transaction before signing.\n\nI used to think the answer was to create an offline signing tool to address this gap. However, manually managing private keys is not easy to do securely. There are too many moving parts. Getting privacy and security right is non-trivial.\n\nAn alternative is Electrum running in online/offline cold storage mode. The offline component can run from a Linux live boot disk such as Tails. Back up the seed mnemonic and be done with it. The system is easy to set up and maintain. It's more convenient and secure than paper wallets, but you have to look at the whole picture to realize it.": 1, "Here's how I've been doing it with Electrum offline. There's a little setup work if you haven't set up an Electrum offline wallet yet.\n\n1. Create your new cold wallet with an *offline* machine. \n\n2. Import your paper wallet private keys.\n\n3. Save out the Master Public Key from Electrum. \n\n4. Enter the Master Public Key into your *online* version of Electrum, thereby creating a watch-only wallet.\n\n5. Import your paper wallet *public address*. This part's a little tricky because the UI doesn't import public addresses properly. :(\n\n    1. Quit Electrum. Make a backup of the wallet file and open it in a text editor.\n   \n    1. Find where it says `'mpk': 'your_master_public_key'}},`\n\n    2. Enter your public addresses *after* that text as follows:\n\n     `'imported_keys': {'1your_public_key_one': '', '1your_public_key_two': '', '1your_public_key_three': ''},`\n\n    3. Note, the empty apostrophes after the colons are where your private keys would go IF you were importing them, but you're not.\n\n6. Open the wallet again with Electrum. You should see your imported addresses and balances.\n\n7. Create a new unsigned transaction. \n\n8. Enter the destination address, then enter '!' in the amount to send the entire amount minus fee. \n\n9. Save the transaction to a file. Move it to the offline computer.\n\n10. Open the unsigned transaction in the *offline* version of Electrum. Sign it and save it.\n\n11. Finally, bring it back to the online machine and use Electrum or Blockchain.info to broadcast it. \n\n12. **Remember that imported private keys are NOT protected by Electrum's 12 word deterministic seed!** You still need to keep your paper backups.\n\nIt seems like a lot when I write it out, but I broke it into as many steps as possible. I like this method because I can combine my Electrum seed's cold storage along with my paper wallets, resulting in a cold wallet containing all private keys for signing transactions, and a watch-only version for monitoring balances, creating and managing transactions, and exporting .CSVs for bookkeeping. Any feedback or crits on this method would be greatly appreciated.": 2, 'Ya, with Mycelium it is pretty much painless.\n\nStep 1.) Menu, ... Cold Storage\nStep 2.) Press "QR Code" as answer to "Get private key from?" question.\nStep 3.) Scan Paper Wallet private key\nStep 4.) Scan destination Bitcoin address.\nStep 5.) Send\n': 2, "Seems like it could work, but I'm not clear on the reasons for doing it.\n\nIn other words, why introduce external paper wallets into this system in the first place?\n\nElectrum already gives you everything you need for cold storage. What do you gain by adding externally-generated private keys?": 1, "How much effort you put into this depends on the amount involved and how much that amount means to you. My preferred way is to use Electrum on a Raspberry Pi offline. You can import the key, pay it to a regular seeded address or anywhere else knowing the change will return to your Electrum wallet and be safe. This isn't hard or expensive. Write down and keep the seed safe. But I can understand if the amount isn't large then simpler methods may be fine too.": 1, "In my case, I'm using this method to transition cold storage from paper wallets to Electrum securely. My intention has been to migrate completely to HD wallets, but I've been considering leaving a percentage in paper wallets in the event that my Electrum seed is somehow compromised. ": 2, 'I, personally, use the mycelium app on a not rooted android phone. There is a cold spending feature. :) Whenever you get your private key into any system, you expose it to some risks.
