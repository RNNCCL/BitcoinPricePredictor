Let\'s exaggerate for clarity - if $6.9 billion of bitcoin was held by one person who refused to sell unless the price increased 100x, then the effective liquidity available would be just $100 million.  The question is, how does a change in bitcoin price change the willingness of holders of bitcoin to sell.  Or in other words, what is the derivative of liquidity with respect to price?  When BTC goes from $500 to $550, how many additional $ worth of BTC will be offered? vs  when the price goes from $3000 to $3300?  Your assumption is that the # of coins offered will be constant, so the $ amount of coins offered will increase linearly with price.  That may be true.  I\'m not really disagreeing.  Just saying it\'s an assumption, and one that is often wrong in trending markets.

Can be solved easily by moving that top and bottom spine stitch closer to the book edge (maybe in a future version).

I get that it's tough in this digital age. But set down the smartphone and close the laptop for a few minutes each day and put pen to paper to write or just doodle. You will be amazed at the richness of your thoughts and insights as you look back years later. Plus, the value of something as personal and private as a handwritten journal becomes increasingly important in this age of internet permanence and surveillance. I've been journaling since I was 15, and I've been able to look back and glimpse my youth in ways that have made me laugh and cry.

After all, a bank can't lend money for interest without borrowing it from its depositors, which is the essence of FRB. I'm assuming a commercial BTC bank (meaning it uses consumer deposits), not an investment bank (meaning it uses its own capital), which I suppose is more likely to occur first.\n\nAnd then there's the rather important question of contract enforcement. If the borrower doesn't pay, how does the lender obtain its collateral? At some point, existing state-based legal structures would need to seize the house on behalf of the lender. That, in turn, rather negates the purpose of a stateless currency.": 1, 'Lending has always existed in deflationary currencies.': 1, 'You don\'t know what you\'re talking about. FRB is not a product of fiat currency. It began with gold-backed currencies, and basically co-existed with the rise of banking in general.\n\nFRB: Depositor A deposits $100. Bank then lends $90 to Borrower B, and keeps the remaining $10 as a cushion. Repeat this process 15,000 times, the bank has a pretty big cushion, and odds are it\'s pretty safe most of the time. Numerous highly-paid statisticians and historical economists have done calculations providing the best ratio of cushion to lending.\n\nThere are all kinds of caveats to be added here, including (but not limited to) the amount of cushion kept (called "reserves"), the risk involved in doing it, historical errors in calculation by banks, and deposit insurance. But I don\'t feel like typing that all up right now.\n\nHowever, what I just described is fractional reserve banking. "Fractional reserve" meaning the reserves are a fraction of the total lending. Without FRB, there would be zero point to running a commercial banking enterprise. The bank would be unable to make money on depositor monies, so it would be unable to pay interest on those deposits. Depositors, in turn, would realize that they would be safer burying the money in their back yard - no risk of an insolvent bank going down with their deposit - so they\'d do that instead (or invest it).

The saver still has access to his deposits if he wants it. And the borrower has his money too.\n\nThe deposited money exists once - it\'s the money that has been lent out or is held as bank reserves.

However when you are paid out you are being paid from the banks reserves. \n\n>This doesn\'t work with bitcoin because if the saver ever wants his bitcoin back, he can\'t because the borrower now has them.\n\nHere\'s how it would work.  When you deposit coins in BitBank they are longer in your wallet. Instead they are placed into BitBanks Wallet/Cold Storage. You now have a BitBank Account which states your holdings and allows you to request money be transferred to your personal wallet. \n\nBitBank can then make loans to other people by transferring money from their wallet (which has *your coins*) to other people\'s personal wallets.

Well that's ok.\n\nBut printing money is generally a tax, and it is a tax that hits especially the people who hoard the money, and do not put it to any use.

I can promise that if / when they are not sold out, they will be added to the collection. \n\n": 10, "This would be a question for BuySellAds, since they are handling the bitcoin payments. I *believe* that they are converting, but I can't speak for them. We do convert BTC that comes in for reddit gold. ": 19, 'The payment systems aren\'t the same and don\'t function the same. There is no advertising "account", or we could create a solution like BSA has. We would have to move away from our current payment processor and thats just not something we have the time to go through, lots of other priorities. If we found people were using this often, and bitcoin became a larger contributor to gold revenue it would be easier to devote the resources. \n\nThanks for whitelisting reddit!': 2, "We agree. The current state of accepting Bitcoin @BuySellAds is just a small first step in where we're ultimately looking to go.": 18, 'The support fixed it for me. \n\nhttp://blog.buysellads.com/2014/buysellads-now-accepts-bitcoin-payments/\n:\n\n\nif you\xe2\x80\x99d like to pay for your ads via Bitcoin, simply go to this link and adjust the amount: http://bsa.ly/bitcoin': 2, 'Well, buying something with crypto only to have it immediately converted to fiat isn\'t really great for the currency. The only difference between selling your bitcoins and buying something with the fiat from that, and buying something in bitcoin directly which is immediately converted is the message that "Hey, I\'d like to be able to use bitcoin."\n\nThe endgame needs to be people using crypto and keeping crypto to use again later. Imagine you want to give about $300 USD to your friend in kenya. You buy $300 BTC on localbitcoins then send that to your friend who sells it on an exchange and gets cash deposited to their bank account. Does that offer any practical benefits over something like western union? Not much really. The "fees" paid may be a bit better but when you weigh them against convenience, western union or paypal is a better value overall. \n\nAlthough its a long ways off, its important to start moving towards a society where crypto transactions are received and kept until they need to be spent, rather than a temporary store of value for moving fiat around semi secretly. ': 14, "You're always welcome to build your own Reddit and implement that feature, that's your choice.": -1, 'There are plenty of cryptocurrency-related subreddits, but as a start you could check coinmarketcap.com for a list of all cryptocurrencies and look them up on reddit.\n\nIt would be awesome if there was a way that advertisers could select the subreddits they wanted to advertise at, just like the reddit ads engine.\n\nEver considered running your own ad engine for reddit, offering multiple banner placements, with a simple bidding system?': 1, 'I see it as a good thing.\n\nOne day, a loop will form, and the companies involved will realise they could just send the bitcoins instead.\n\nThe important thing now is just 3 things : \n\n1. Good wallet software for individual users, it should make everything easy-peasy so your grandma can use it, and handle things like keeping a hot wallet and a dedicated safe at home that should be seamless (like a mini ATM)\n\n2. Good packages that integrate easily into business software (think bitpay/coinbase) It should be professional, reliable and easy. They need to make it so if the company has a supplier that accepts bitcoin, it is just a flick of the switch for them to start sending bitcoins rather than converting to USD.\n\n3. Just get as many businesses using it as possible. Even if they have 0% in bitcoin sales, just having bitcoin integrated means that when their suppliers accept it and their customers do, it is seamless. Because of the deflationary nature of bitcoin, most processors are going to be able to offer discounts. Because of this, suppliers are the most important people to get bitcoin working for, because it is customers who are going to be drawn to the discounts.': 1, 'All I see for deposit options is paypal/credit card/wire transfer ...\n\nSo ...

But it is a pretty powerful reduction in the network effect when you can link directly from the original reddit to your new reddit, use old reddit accounts as a signup option in the new reddit, have the new reddit look and work exactly the same by default, and even have bots bridge unread message notifications over. Not nearly perfect, but I kind of am surprised more people have not done it.': 1, 'No shit?': -1, 'Thank you (and consider keeping a % of income in bitcoin).': 2, "Half of the subreddits listed are dogecoin related.
