Not one too permissive, not one too restrictive, not one different in representation but equivalent in meaning.  To make matters worse we must do this in an environment where some participants are malicious, where the network is unreliable, and where making the system break can be very profitable. Plus all this is done, theoretically, without any authority that can tell people what is correct or not when there are problems (otherwise, what happens if that authority is one of the malicious participants?).\n\nToday, software developers often have a hard time getting two compiles of a 100kbyte program by just two distinct people to turn out completely identical, even with no malicious actors at all, even without an asynchronous distributed system in the mix... even though they\xe2\x80\x94 in theory\xe2\x80\x94 completely control the inputs and the environment. \n\nThis is outside of the space that good tools and practices exist for... It\'s hard enough to achieve in the non-malicious case, where all the software is identical.  Without a centralized authority to enforce software consistency we have the additional problem that tools to strongly prove that two distinct programs actually implement exactly the same functionality are practically non-existant.\n\nWe (mankind) are The Sorcerer\'s Apprentice, and sometimes the conjuring gets away from us.  Someday the state of the art in software engineering and formal methods will give us tools which allow for powerful reasoning about these systems, where certain kinds of faults will be provably absent. But that day is not today. Today software is more like cities in the 1800s before modern fire control tools and technology had been widely adopted or even invented, where they radomly burned to the ground from time to time.\n\nIdeally\xe2\x80\x94 Bitcoin\'s transparent machine codified rules should be enforced in a way which is  physically impossible for others to compromise, no matter for what reason, no matter how good the excuse, no matter what.  But imperfections in the "Bitcoin machine" shatter that ideal, because there is a risk that we must choose between the suicide-pact of accepting the those rules even when they are "obviously wrong", or allowing human judgement to creep back in.\n\nSo, yes, you can invoke an unspecified external "human process" to magically resolve the nasty problems that arise from the inherent fragility of consensus systems built from faulty software and protocols... but the problem with doing this is that escaping the repeatedly non-trustworthy "human process" is a big part of what makes Bitcoin distinctive and desirable in the first place\xe2\x80\x94 Rule by math, not by (expedient) politics.\n\nToo much recourse to the external process implies a risk that the external processes "fixes" things which aren\'t broken. That it "fixes" the scarcity of coins, that it "fixes" the ownership of coins, that it "fixes" the ability of unpopular parties to spend, that it "fixes" your privacy or finical self-determination, that it "fixes" your ability to participate in this system as an equal and by doing so help to uphold the systems promises. Fixing bugs is something anyone can support\xe2\x80\x94 until they find out that they\'ve been declared to be the bug. If you want a system ruled by the whim of the public, you already have the fiat systems of democratic nations. Systems of greater efficiency, stability, and (some kinds of) security can be built if true trusnessless and relative freedom from coercion risk are abandoned as goals.\n\nWe\'ve been fortunate in that the number of severe consensus splits so far has been few, and they\'ve been of a character where there was no serious ambiguity about the appropriate eventual state (e.g. no one claiming with a straight face that value overflow resulting a billion bitcoins out of thin air should be permitted)\xe2\x80\x94 and so the human recourse was effective.\n\nBut intervention comes with a risk, and we should be always mindful what the ideal is, and strive to eliminate any need to use the magical workaround to the inherent fragility of the consensus system\xe2\x80\x94 because it is just as equally a serious liability. The next disagreement between what some people say and what the machines say may not be so clear cut... and if it\'s the norm to override the system, we\'ll lose the ability to be strongly confident about its future behavior\xe2\x80\x94 just like legacy alternatives, but without the eons of experience and adoption.\n\nAll this said\xe2\x80\x94 I don\'t worry that much, at least not by my worry-prone standards.  If the users of Bitcoin understand these challenges and are serious about supporting a system with Bitcoin\'s properties then all these risks are navigable. But I think it\'s important to be frank about them, so that we can all think clearly and critically and make the best decisions for ourselves to help grow and protect a useful system which will hopefully benefit all man-kind.

It just makes you sound like an ignorant ideologue. I don\'t think Silk Road was bad, in fact I agree with your statements on it, both the point about it providing a safer context to buy and sell drugs in, but also the point about addiction taking away the ability to choose. But, you also overly glorify Silk Road in my opinion, as well. My ex-girlfriend\'s friend died from using drugs he bought on Silk Road. Deaths and horrible occurrences came out of Silk Road as well, but largely on the whole, it was positive given that drugs are necessarily going to exist and be taken.\n\n>Buying and selling bitcoins doesn\'t make it easier or harder to do drugs or to stop drugs. That\'s just a lie you\'ve been fed.\n\nI am a critical thinker who doesn\'t regurgitate the garbage "I\'m fed" and you sound really silly attempting to extrapolate my world view based on a paragraph I wrote. I am also not discussing the merits of Silk Road, but rather the fact that you can\'t start an exchange that you want to be seen as "legitimate" (bs word, but take it as you will) with VC money from notable investors (the Winklevoss\') and also help launder money for an illegal marketplace and expect to get away with it. Again, I\'m not saying this is necessarily what Charlie was aiming to do, but if he was, then he is not very bright for thinking he can get away with it. My apologies about taking this hypothetical further than it should probably be taken, but I personally take a cautious stance without knowing the full facts.\n\n>You go ahead and keep thinking that. Yeah, code is non-political. Bitcoin doesn\'t have a viewpoint. Dark Wallet doesn\'t have a viewpoint. Tor doesn\'t have a viewpoint. It\'s all just non-political code. Of fucking course Bitcoin has a viewpoint. The viewpoint is the code itself.\n\nDid I say that Bitcoin was non-political? No I said it does NOT represent a SINGULAR viewpoint. Clearly you disagree, but to me, that difference only proves my point. And Dark Wallet, etc., is one product out there being developed versus a product like Circle which I wholeheartedly do not support, but again, shows that there are different views on how Bitcoin can and/or should progress. There is not a singular opinion on what Bitcoin should be, and what it means to the world. You seem to care more about the anarchistic and anonymous properties of it, which are great, but I tend to focus more on it being a source of empowerment to the unbanked when possible, a great means of doing remittances, etc.\n\n>Then you can monitor businesses you invest with closely. But when your thoughts on the Silk Road impact others\' ability to buy and sell bitcoin, you\'ve tread on fungibility. And you had better at least realize that\'s true.\n\nAgain, I never expressed any negative thoughts about Silk Road, you are assuming without much basis. I think Silk Road was good overall, but you can\'t both start an exchange you hope to become a top exchange in the space and expect to comply with regulation, and then try to launder money for an illegal marketplace. Again, I\'m not saying that was Charlie\'s intention, but you seem to be arguing that that is an intelligent course of action, and I think you need to either do one or the other or you\'re going to get caught.

The Silk Road took gang/cartel violence off the street and replaced it with anonymous seller rating systems that made the use of violence completely useless.  It took away the uncertainty of the quality of product you were going to get and replaced that with a rating.  It made doing drugs safer, for users and for sellers.  It made the world safer and better.  The only argument against it is if you think people shouldn\'t be allowed to do what they want with their bodies.  And to be honest, I can understand that viewpoint.  Addiction takes away the ability to choose -- one is not one\'s self when one is an addict -- so I can see the argument for saying that some 3rd party needs to make that choice for another.\n\nBut moving money around is not related to that.

You can\'t "launder" very much money in hiding.  Second of all, he repeatedly made sure he was acting correctly and by the books.  The only "evidence" against him is explaining to somebody what procedures he had to follow.  He *always followed them*.  The charge against him is that he was helping launder money by helping the guy avoid regulations because he merely told the guy what procedures he was following.\n\nThirdly, "money laundering" is a crime of concealing money *from a crime*.  The guy Charlie sold to just sold bitcoins and cash on Silk Road, he didn\'t sell any drugs.  He was basically a middleman for Charlie\'s business model, but with a higher cut, and he made the difference.

But here's my 2 cents.\n\nFirstly, Charlie was a visible bitcoin activist in the very early days from New York who ran a company that was funded by the Winklevoss twins who were also relatively early adopters.\n\nThat may not sound like much, but it is. Early visible people, who get interviewed, who do a local presentation, who start a company, who go to conferences and who get funded are a big thing, especially in the early days. That's the type of stuff that legitimizes bitcoin. Until such people came around, bitcoin was just something that happened on computers owned by computer scientists and were as obscure as linden dollars. It wasn't mainstream, it wasn't in the news, it wasn't something that happened in the physical world (through conferences, actual companies, actual people getting funding from semi-celebrities etc)\n\nVisibility is a big thing. Look at Andreas Antonopolous, he hasn't actually built his own successful bitcoin company, hasn't actually done much protocol work, hasn't built a platform, hasn't received VC funding etc... but he was visible. Visibility means so much. Not as much today now that you have half a billion dollar of VC funding and CEOs and VCs and tech legends and big companies like Dell or Expedia involved. But back when bitcoin was nothing, visible people meant a LOT.\n\nAs for Silk Road... I don't think bitcoin would exist without it. I'm not a fan of silk road, never used it, never had an interest to use it (although it's interesting to follow it as a phenomenon). But it was instrumental in creating the marketplace in which bitcoin had near-zero competition. Bitcoin could never ever compete with another currency in the licit market in the days when we didn't have an exchange in every country. Nobody in their right mind would buy bitcoin to use as a currency. EXCEPT in the only place that normal currencies don't work, a market like Silk Road. That's why it became big, and got the ball rolling to where it can thrive even without Silk Road.

Almost since Bitcoin's beginning.\n\nAnd yet they have no solution. Not even a proposed or potential solution.\n\nWhy? Because there is no solution folks. Only attempts to delay the inevitable.\n\nThe 'floating transaction fees' idea, now just given the green light, is one such attempt.\n\nYou can go one of two ways: Either leave transaction fees as they are, and the blockchain inevitably starts to bloat until the 1MB block size limit is hit and raised (think of this artificial size limit akin to a national 'debt ceiling'), or increase transaction fees to discourage the number of transactions occurring.\n\nThe developers have chosen the second.\n\nAnd it's only going to get worse if transaction numbers increase. Ironically, this is on top of the stealth tax paid to miners, who are currently debasing Bitcoin at a rate of $25 per second. Who pays for it? Why, you of course, the HODLer - who else? So in reality, Bitcoin transaction fees are very great indeed!\n\nOne last thing: There is talk here of 'off-chain transactions', 'payment channels', and other such gobbledygook designed to obscure the true meaning - which can be simply stated as reliance on centralized entities. \n\nIn other words, just like fiat, but worse! That's what the original conception of Bitcoin has devolved into. Once you pay your transaction fee, exchange fees, escrow fees, Bitpay fees, 'ATM' fees, and whatever else there is - you may end up realizing that you would have been *better off* using Paypal with its simple and more reliable ~3% fee. Or Google Wallet with no fee, and is simple as sending an email.\n\n>b-but muh decentralized trust! muh Ethiopian remittances! Paypal/Google don't have that! ..d-do they?\n\nWe have already established (as per above) that the former is not only becoming cost prohibitive but is also being done away with in favor of greater centralization, and few people have a need for the latter.\n\n>b-but how do you know nodes will have to upload 5GB every ten minutes?\n\nI'm glad you asked.\n\nI start by using a figure found in the Bitcoin wiki which you can lookup for yourself: A 1MB block can hold 2400 transactions.\n\nThis may or may not be generous, but lets be conservative and take it as granted.\n\nNow according to the [Visa website](http://usa.visa.com/merchants/industry-solutions/retail-visa-acceptance.jsp), they 'handle an *average* of 150 million transactions every day'.\n\nThat equates to 1736.11 transactions per second.\n\nA block is created every 10 minutes. So, 1736.11 x 60 seconds x 10 minutes = 1,041,666.66 transactions per block to match Visa.\n\nUsing the aforementioned 1MB = 2400 transactions figure, 1,041,666.66 divided by 2400 = 434.03MB per block.\n\nNow for the last part, regarding Nodes uploading at least 5GB. I did a search here for posts from people running nodes. What I found is that currently they are uploading 10 times as much as they download. So I simply calculate 500MB x 10 = 5GB.

The main concern is not hard drive space to store the blockchain, but internet bandwidth - particularly the amount of bandwidth that must be squeezed through the international sea cables, of which there are only a handful. If Bitcoin grows in adoption - say becomes the size of VISA, not only will you need extremely fast internet connections that can simulatanously upload and download several gigabytes a second each way (and be able to pay for it - remember, nodes run for free!), but you will also need to expand the capacity of the international sea cables enormously - and that would require tens of billions of dollars of national/international investment.\n\n>Bitcoin is as anonymous as you want it to be.

And since iOS is a closed system, users also will be enforced to use whatever currency they given, because they don't want to lose iPhone experience, and most people don't ready to switch from iPhone to something else, just because of some accent to some technology which is philosophically not liked by many people.\n\nYes I understand that Bitcoin's userbase is around 5 million people now, and at the time Apple will implement their own fork there could be something like 100 to 500 million users of Bitcoin already (if that happens in future)\n\nAnd even such adoption rate won't help Apple proclaiming that their fork is better than Bitcoin. Because users will find connections & every end user at the end will know that there Bitcoin is a parent technology, more supreme than Apple's copy - and that will make Apple add additional point into their portfolio of companies who copy the other's works.\n\nBut you told that it doesn't work that way, so what am I missing then?

Also such big company may even not pre-mine, and they will anyway gain benefits.\n\nOnce Tim Cook announces the fork, it becomes irreversible decision, on one hand you can't resist innovation, on the other hand there's nothing wrong with it.\n\nEven if they will pre-mine coins not for 50%, but for 90%, do you think users will have choice? Do you think that this is what society will choose to protest against?\n\nYou really think there is a way back after such a thing launched?\n\nIf Apple developers will start working under creation of very convenient services, they will have success in adoption, because once they will understand - they will start competing in mobile decentralization market against such services as Storj & other decentralized projects.\n\nBitcoin believers repeatedly compare Bitcoin to the beginning of the Internet, and there is so much Apple devices, that any decision made by this company sets new industry standards.

The companies it applies to are financial institutions that maintain some form of control over clients' bitcoin deposits.  In its current proposed state it would compel businesses to be...\n\n* Fiinancially audited\n\n* To have dedicated security staff\n\n* To operate with full reserves\n\n* Have sizeable capital reserves at the start\n\n* Have disaster contingency plans on file\n\n* Follow KYC/AML requirements\n\n* Maintain books and records similarly to most corporations\n\n* Retain excess profits in high grade investment pieces\n\nThe largest effect on end users would be KYC/AML compliance which would require users to provide some identifying information to bitcoin financial institutions in the same manner that they already do with traditional financial institutions. ": 3, '> shipito.com\n\nHad to dig real deep in the forum to find that they do accept bitcoin (as of 6 days ago). They should make that clearer on the website somewhere.\nAlso it appears they are willing to look at discounts for bitcoin payments soon.\n\n': 1, 'A university in Switzerland is experimenting with it in their cafeteria: https://pay.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/2f8y9x/switzerlands_largest_university_tests_touchless/': 1, 'The /r/bitcoinmarkets thread has been around for a lot longer and has had time to develop and attract a following.  I think expecting instant success is unreasonable and we should give it more time to mature.\n\nI also think people are used to ignoring the sticky since it has just been the FAQ for so long.  It might be worth it to make the daily thread a regular submission at least for awhile until it becomes more established.': 3, 'Am I doing this right?

ELI5 please.': 2, "The other thing is that they actively remove threads that belong in the daily thread. Pretty sure I can't get away with that without pissing everyone off. \n\nAgreed about the sticky getting ignored. In fact it seems like this thread is having a lower response than usual, but maybe it's because of Labor Day.": 1, 'I love moronic Mondays. It should be stickied every Monday. \n\nThe daily threads are too much, I agree. \n\nMaybe a weekly recap thread on Friday/Saturday covering big stories that happened during the week? ': 8, 'Anything larger than 8 and you are contributing ': 1, 'Oops I forgot this one was different. How about just leaving moronic Monday up all week? It\'s a great updated "faq"': 1, 'Are the fees for all the transactions in a block just added to the reward of the person that mines the block?': 2, "Good collection! I'll have to take a closer look. ": 2, "Sticky threads are boring. They are anti reddit, I don't know why people think they are a good idea. People come here for new topics and news. Not a green thread which was also here yesterday or the other week. If you make moronic Monday stickied every Monday you are going to kill participation in that in that as well as it looses its appeal in the long run from not being spontaneous. Moronic Monday posts should not be there every Monday, only the Mondays it gets up voted.... I know what's happening to the mods. They want to create a better subreddit, and since they can basically only sticky, they think everything needs stickying... They rethink its a good tool to make a better a better subreddit. But like argued before stickies are generally a bad idea. But when all you got is a hammer everything looks like a nail. Rambling off...": -2, 'Any news about GABI? \n\n': 9, 'There are some good resources for learning about the basics of bitcoin here: http://offtheblockchain.com/bitcoin-guides/learn-about-bitcoin/': 1, "My guess is that several are either working on it, or keeping a close eye on how the tech develops. I think it's still about a year away, even if new phones have NFC already. ": 1, "Unfortunately not. You're definitely not alone in thinking that full nodes should be subsidized though. How would you do it? What happens when the block reward shrinks and you've got miners fighting with full nodes over transaction fees?": 2, 'Running a full node/copy of the Blockchain (23GB of Data?) on one of my web-facing servers.

Paying wages in Bitcoin could be a little more sticky, though.": 1, 'Hosting a full copy of the Block Chain/Node (23GB?) on one of my Internet-facing servers.  Is there any benefit, except supporting the community?  Are there transactions fees that inure to me?\n': 1, "I don't hate them but I believe the sentiment is \n\n\nFirstly they are centralizing mining, this is bad for Bitcoin generally as you want many distributed machines verifying the blockchain rather than 1 machine running Petahash of mining power.\n\n\nSecondly their return to customers is less than just buying bitcoin.  They're essentially playing on people's ignorance to mining and the maths behind it.\n\n\nThirdly because they're encouraging people to put their money in and essentially make a loss it makes the whole mining ecosystem a loss so those that mine privately are now making far less money than they should on paper because the mining power is going up faster than it really can.\n\n\nFourthly they are a private company so an easy target.\n\n\nFinally there is some speculation that it's just a ponzi scheme whereby the profits are repaid by other investors until the whole thing collapses.  This is other people's speculation and probably bullshit since you can determine where the coins you've earned have come from but it is plausible since they are essentially returning less to investors than they put in.\n\n\nTL;DR:  Cex don't appear to be ethical and not representing the decentralised ethos behind bitcoin.\n": 7}}}
