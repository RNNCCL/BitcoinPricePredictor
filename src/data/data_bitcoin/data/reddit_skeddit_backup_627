As to the lack of wavefunction collapse... um... that\'s... y\'know... its primary feature. That\'s the whole point to it. The math never talks about collapse, so let\'s assume it doesn\'t. Perceiving discrete events is exactly what you would expect in an uncollapsed wavefunction. You correlate your state with another system\'s state by observing it. You both go into superposition but stay correlated. So the bit of the system called \'you\' that corresponds to the neural correlates of the qualia of perceiving the measurement are also in superposition. Many futures, single past.

But the MWI is pretty well accepted nowadays and is IMHO the only interpretation of QM that isn\'t batshit crazy. It may be testable, though, if we get a particular kind of quantum computer built.\n\n\nYea... no. MWI is accepted as a philosophical interpretation, but faces a lot of problems like Born rule probabilities not being compatible as well as preferred basis.\nIn short summary if the Born Rule (which is the reason we believe QM in the first place) gives you an asymmetric probability of something occuring, you run into problems. Say Outcome A is 1% to B 99% and you conduct the experiment. According to MWI there is now 2 universes, which would make the probability 50% vs 50%, but we know from infinite measurements (Again why we believe in QM) that the probability is 1% vs 99%. This has lead some to go in desperate hunts of solutions, but none are accepted as valid.\n\nThen you have the fact that if all there is is a wavefunction, you have no way for decomposing. There is nothing that says "This is a system and this is an environment" so the decoherence programme can\'t account for why we percieve clear outcomes and not a fuzzy mixture of outcomes.\n\n\nPlus MWI predicts literal immortality, since there is always a non-zero probability of you surviving ANYTHING in at least one branch.

And the answer is, we just don\'t know. It may be that time travel that causes change is impossible. ie. you go back to kill your grampa, fail, and then remember that story he told you one time about almost getting killed - this is a hyper deterministic timeline, and choice vs. free will depends exclusively on the perspective of the obsever. \n\nIt may be that you go back, make a change, and the universe just doesn\'t care about globally inconsistent timelines. It doesn\'t matter if the whole thing is nonsense, as long as each event logically connencts to the next. This is like the Empodyclean paradox: The following statement is true. The preceding statement was false.  "I came back to change x. I succeeded. Which means I never would have come back. Which means x had to happen. And the universe is ok with that." This may be how the universe work. Call it Star Trek rules, since that\'s how their time travel usually worked.\n\nThe other major possibility is that the Everit-Wheeler-Graham Many Worlds Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics (or its decedent) is correct. I\'ll skip the details, but the end result is that everything that is physically possible to encode in the universe, actually occurs.In bad movies they usually say something stupid like "every time you make a choice, the world splits into two parallel worlds", but that really downplays the situation and focusses on choice like it\'s relevant. What really happens is that every time a particle interacts with another, the universe splits into as many worlds as there are outcomes. (Or possibly something way weirder I wont get into here.) So, going back in time presents no issues to causality.You\'d go back, kill your grampa/hack a blockchain, and there would be and always had been two worlds - one where you showed up and one where you didn\'t.\n\nNow, like I said, we don\'t know which if any of these ideas are correct.

This has pros and cons, but over the past few years of SPV/lightweight wallets there haven't been any total outages (yet).\n\nFinally Lighthouse is a tool, not a service. One day I will move on from Bitcoin and I don't want Lighthouse to suddenly stop working because of that. If it was web based, that's pretty much what would happen. Though avoiding the web might seem strange and old fashioned, by doing it that goal is achieved - it doesn't rely on my servers for much beyond auto update checks.": 29, 'It was run on GLBSE but then that service closed down... share transfers are now handled manually because the board has not found any alternative that they are confident is secure enough.  Several places offer a secondary market to trade shares including but not limited to Havelock investments.\n\nNearly all history of this company is contained in this single forum thread.\n\nhttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=99497.0\n\nIf you take two steps back and look at it, it seems crazy and absurd... if you are inside it... it only gets more strange.

It doesn\'t upload everything you do to us anymore than Microsoft Word does - you can create a project, distribute it, collect money for it etc and Vinumeris GmbH will never know.\n\nOne exception is if you\'d like to use the Lighthouse project server we run. Servers coordinate collection of pledges (but can\'t spend/steal them, note), and as noted in the FAQ, you must submit the project to your chosen server operator via email. Projects that are illegal or obviously scams won\'t be accepted. You can still use Lighthouse but you would have to run your own server or use the "serverless mode" and do it all yourself. Whatever route you choose, you still have to distribute the project file in some way, i.e. via a website, and at that point finding you is the same process as for any website owner. So if you\'re doing something illegal it\'s no different to if you were using Bitcoin without Lighthouse on a regular website.\n\nWith respect to tax, it\'s again the same as using any Bitcoin wallet. You\'re responsible for complying with tax rules in your jurisdiction.': 1, "Actually it can be done without changing Lighthouse itself:\n\nLighthouse already has all the functionality required for securities.\n\nThe one thing you'd need to do is write some code in the decentralized asset client to import a Lighthouse seed to recover the private key to spend the newly created assets. (and depending on the scheme, some issuer/protocol code to take the crowdfunded funds and create tokens from that txout)\n\nOf course, some Lighthouse-specific code could make for a nicer UI, but the functionality is all there already.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/2t1an9/bitcoinpowered_crowdfunding_app_lighthouse_has/cnv03yb": 1, 'There are potentially many crowd funded projects that would never get the time of day without potential financial return for investors.

Pretty sure there are laws on the practice of investing, but I'd need to do some serious research.\n\nCrowdfunding is legal, but I bet that investing off-the-books like this is going to catch up to someone in court. Be interesting to see if this shapes the law or falls victim to it.": 3, 'They write that directly in the lighthouse client.

That activity is governed in the US by SEC and state securities rules.  In simple terms, a security is when you have the right to profit from the work of others, such as shares of company stock.  The definition of a security, and the government rules that apply to them, are way more complicated than that, but you should be at least aware of what king of tarpit you are stepping into.\n\nYou can choose to ignore securities rules, but if they catch you, expect large fines or jail time.  You can also try to avoid the rules, by working from a lenient location, or making your offering "not a security".  For example, instead of raising capital for a big factory machine by selling shares, you can have the investors buy the machine as partners or joint owners, then lease it from them.': 1, 'Before you had to build something poorly, get people to use it, then take their money and run.  Now you just have to tell people you are going to build something.  Not really any different than Kickstarter but with Kickstarter at least Kickstarter knows who you are.': 2, 'If you mean "why doesn\'t it run in a browser", I think one of the answers would be:\n\nBecause browsers (still) can\'t directly connect to the Bitcoin network. If you tried to make a browser-based app that talked to the Bitcoin network, traffic would need to flow through trusted servers which forwarded traffic to full or SPV nodes.\n\nIn other words, it\'s technically impossible to write a full or SPV node ("light wallet") in JavaScript and run it in an unmodified browser. There are ways to change this situation, but they\'d require a new browser-compatible protocol.\n\nNote that there\'s no problem at all writing downloadable JavaScript apps that you run in a browser. The issue is that the browser itself has no way to communicate using the Bitcoin network protocol.': 5, "Does that happen automatically? I didn't do anything to collect the tip.

Thanks for letting me know!": 2, "Huge sign of confidence. \n\nWith 2014 being sort of a slow year in terms of consumer growth rates compared to 2013, it's interesting to see a company focused so much on consumer retail while being strict with their regulatory approach, see their investments quadruple from just 12 months ago. That says a lot, it says the VCs that took a look at their growth rates, traction and their plans and vision liked what they saw, and that's great to hear right now. \n\nNot just that, but the investors aren't just venture capital guys (people who make big bets and are known to fail hardcore and win hardcore). The New York Stock Exchange for example, is an investor. That says something about their stance towards bitcoin and their thoughts on the regulatory position of bitcoin in new york: worth investing in as it's here to stay. Or a large Spanish bank, or a Japanese telecom company. These aren't just signs of confidence but also potential partners. When Google bought Youtube, they brought the google advertiser network to Youtube. When Andreessen Horowitz invested in Coinbase, they partnered the company with other companies in their portfolio (including one acquihire by Coinbase of another AH company) as well as partners (like Nas, a partner of the firm). If a bank or telecom invests in you, they're going to be keen to service you and partner with you for mutual success. That means you might see a banking product come out of this, or the ability to pay for your phone subscription with bitcoin over the next 2 years as they leverage these relationships. This is a big deal.\n\nOh they also announced plans to go from 19 countries to 30 by the end of 2015. To speculate a bit, that means that starting 2016 they'll expand outside of OECD countries, which is a big deal as that means bringing consumer-friendly products to countries without the strongest banking infrastructure or stable currencies. That's hugely interesting. It'd coincide with higher penetration of smartphones and internet connectivity in such countries, and hopefully with deeper exchange markets (possible ETF?), making it easier and cheaper to offer automatic derivatives to cheaply lock in the price of bitcoin (meaning people in countries with weak currencies will now be able to get modern financial services without any potential volatility of bitcoin). \n\nThey already explicitly mentioned India.\n\nedit: thanks /u/metamirror for the gold!\n\nLastly: Speculation on their valuation? Would be interesting. \n\nThey had a $140m valuation after their Series B when they raised $25m (I think $31m in total then).\n\nAt the same multiplier, their $106m valuation is now close to $480. Of course you normally lower your multiplier as each round goes by, so this is an optimistic figure.\n\nIn November 2014 they were reported to raise between $40m and $60m at a $400m valuation. Instead they raised $75m.\n\nSo what do you think? Well I'd say a $400m valuation is pretty certain, perhaps $450m. What that tells you about whether bitcoin is undervalued (2900m total market cap) is up to you to decide :)\n\nAs for context, they raised $75m. In all of 2013, the entire bitcoin industry ended up raising $90m, only slightly over 1 year ago. ": 130, "Yeah they have a few million in annual revenue. The Japanese telecom (largest in Japan, and Japan is the third largest economy in the world) has 33 billion in revenue. If they accept bitcoin it's as if 10 thousand Mobile Vikings (by revenue) accept bitcoin.\n\nIn short, it'd be a big deal.\n\nBut more importantly, paying for your sub was just a quick basic example.

One of the world's most powerful companies?\n\nhttp://phandroid.com/2013/09/19/google-wallet-nfc-payments-blocked/\n\nDid you know there was a bitcoin wallet like Mpesa in Kenya that was blocked by the carrier?\n\nMy point is, carriers are hugely powerful and a big player in the payments space. Partnering with them is about MUCH more than just paying your subscription with bitcoin, there are all kinds of interesting payments opportunities there. \n": 14, "That's awesome, sort of.

Your private keys are random but computers aren't very excellent at begin random. So if you use something that isn't very random then someone else might generate the same address as you.

For example an Electrum wallet is deterministic and so it's not just one key but several. It also makes it easier to restore and easier to encrypt the cold storage (encase of physical theft). Wallets contain other info like transaction history but that isn't relevant to cold storage as the wallet doesn't know transaction history without the internet. The reason why purely private keys are typically used is because its very easy to just print a private key on a peace of paper to make a paper wallet.

Cold Storage means those funds can't be used until they are uploaded to an online wallet or exchange.\n\nDon't store much in these online places... create a wallet offline using bitaddress.org or bitcoinpaperwallet.com and  either print the wallet (paper wallet) or store on USB (cold storage) or BOTH!

And yet, Bitcoin continues to defy skepticism and grow. Despite Bitcoin\xe2\x80\x99s performance over the last six months, it is shows phenomenal returns over the past year. Furthermore, Bitcoin\xe2\x80\x99s transaction volume has nearly returned to the level it was at the peak of the last mania. Over its five year history, Bitcoin has grown exponentially, and people have continued to dive in, despite how distant its success may have appeared.\n\n\n>By contrast, nobody benefits from holding dollars. **Dollars benefit the people creating\xc2\xa0them, not the ones saving in them. Hence, there is a relatively small group of people with the incentive to promote dollars as a payment system, consisting of the government-banking cartel. The group with the incentive to promote Bitcoin, on the other hand, is relatively large: it consists of everyone else, even those who have not bought bitcoins yet. Despite the diversity of people involved in Bitcoin, they have a unified incentive to make Bitcoin succeed. Meanwhile, there is no similar incentive for people to cooperate to save the dollar.**\n": 2, "I have the feeling they might be hesitant cause of the potential backlash.

So it could be some hype-guy posted it to influence the price and it got removed after Coinbase sent a complaint. (big companies tend to have alerts set up that automatically email the marketing team whenever big websites post something about their company, they can then follow up on that. If it's bs they can pull or edit it. If it's good news they'll get in touch with the writer 6 months later and send beta invites for new products, products for review, goodie bags etc). So it's entirely plausible some dude lied, posted it to WSJ as a third-party guy, Coinbase saw this and asked WSJ to pull it.\n\nIn short we don't know. But I'll say one thing: it is an entirely plausible amount of money. If you look at Coinbase's growth, their impact in the ecosystem, their aggressive hiring and outstanding vacancies and past valuations ($150m in 2014), as well as their investors (Andreessen Horowitz) recently reiterating their support for bitcoin publicly, it's entirely possible they raised a new round at those numbers.

Yet they continue to pay Gavin (Scientist) and Wladimir (Maintainer) who both lead the respective sides of development (protocol & client, very loosely stated) and enjoy broad based support from the community in this unofficial role. I think it'd be feasible for companies to fund TBF now allowing Gavin and Wladimir to hire a team who they will lead from their position of legitimacy. This is probably a less controversial way to drive development, and also more effective (cohesive teams working towards shared goals rather than individuals from many groups doing their own team).\n\nWhether it'll happen I've got no clue, but I'd really suggest Coinbase talk seriously about funding TBF with $300k per year for two developers to assist Gavin/Wladimir.\n\nIt's been talked about before, a Red Hat for bitcoin.

I just dabble in it.\n\nAnyway: So if you have $1 but after a count found that your assets were valued at $1.2, your dollar is worth more than you thought before the count. This is a "strong dollar", I\'ll get back to what it means for export and import.\n\nThink of it like this way: You\'re the US and I\'m China. You\'ve got a plot of land and there\'s some arable land, plots that contain oil and in your back yard you have a mini setup that makes it into gas, plus you even have some gold and jewelry in your safe. You also dabble in making machines, weapons, electronics and more! Dang son, you\'re a real go-getter!!\n\nHowever we haven\'t agreed on which currency to use, but we do exchange them and to do that we estimate how much they\'re worth against each other based on all of that stuff you have above. You\'ve got all these machines and whatnot lying around, that\'s assets you own and guarantees that the $1000 dollar bills you have is worth at least something. If we count them up I can calculate how much your stuff is worth. We count it, haggle and argue for a while until we agree that in your currency your stuff is worth $1100 dollars and my stuff is worth $800. In my currency your stuff is worth 6800 Yuan and my stuff is worth 5000 Yuan. From this we agree that the conversion rate between our currencies are $1 to 6.22 Yuan.\n\nNow we get to the export and import. The stronger your dollar is, the cheaper it is for you to buy my stuff since the currency conversion will move in your favor. On the other hand, you might get problems selling stuff since i can\'t afford buying your stuff now, but my neighbor Russia can since he somehow came over some new stuff. Unless I can move the currency conversion in my favor, things will just get more and more expensive for me to import. In other words, I\'m getting poorer. So it makes sense to want to have a strong currency, but if your stuff gets too expensive, your exports will suffer. Now in this analogy that\'s not a problem, but if you\'re a politician and have people that lose their jobs over this, it becomes a problem even though a strong currency means your country gets wealthier.': 1, "It will be nice to be able to use an exchange that isn't run by masked crusaders or magic the gathering enthusiasts for once, yes.": 18, 'Thank you! :)': 1, 'If its transparent...you can see through it....and guess what I can see through this..This is not a good thing.': 2, 'Or copycoiners.': 1, 'Yay moon!': 2, 'It\'s how the "investment world" operates, unfortunately. No opinions needed, just look at COMEX holdings of GLD and SLV and then look at how many people ask for delivery. It\'s less than a fraction of one percent. Investors, those who don\'t care about using BitCoin (or gold or silver for that matter) for day-to-day activity, could care less where the actual coins are, or even if they\'re there at all.\n\nSo long as less than 5% or so of investors ask to hold the BitCoin in a personal wallet, nobody\'s the wiser. You gotta remember, the kind of people a BitCoin ETF will attract don\'t know a damn thing about BitCoin, the blockchain, or how it all works. Just as GLD investors don\'t understand how gold repatriation works.\n\nThe BitCoin community isn\'t yet concerned about what ETFs will do for true price discovery as most don\'t have a clue what kind of price-fixing mechanisms ETFs enable.

One of the things mentioned was how much problems the banks had when Argentina suddenly demanded to withdraw all of the gold. Actual gold that they had deposited. Apparently they just was able to find all of it after a lot of searching, but it does raise the question, what would happen if a larger player did the same thing. In this context, Argentina didn\'t have that much gold.\n\nSupposedly, the last full count of the gold in Fort Knox was in 1930. There was supposed to be one in 1950 as well, but it only got part way before it was shut down from above. Soo... since 1950, there has been zero accounting of the actual gold. It\'s mostly on paper as "rented out".\n\nAll of the above statements were from the documentary. I don\'t know how much I believe about it, especially since they promoted the importance of having gold to support the value of the currency, which doesn\'t make much sense to me. I\'d think in order to estimate your currency, you\'d figure out the countries assets and exports (plus, I\'m certain, more I haven\'t thought of) and divide by how much currency you have put into the system. That\'s your currencies actual value. Your gold is just a fractional amount of your assets (well... hopefully).': 2, "Seeing bitcoin traded on a serious exchange would be interesting.\n\nI'm not saying folks like Coinbase aren't serious exchanges, but the current software of the exchanges can't trade like NYSE or the other exchange platforms can.\n\nHave the NYSE software guys implement a bitcoin trading exchange would be huge for reliability and pricing.": 11, 'It has nothing to do with fundamentals of Bitcoin itself, but everything to do with the fundamentals of the Bitcoin/USD trading market, which is an important consideration when determining the market value of bitcoins.\n\nOr is this sort of thing not considered a fundamental but rather a qualitative analysis?

Is the gold really even there anymore?

You\'ll now have hundreds of thousands of people investing in and trading BTC without ever seeing a wallet or having a transaction take place in the blockchain; that\'ll be done by proprietary trading software, and you\'ll take it on "good faith" that your coins are actually deliverable.
