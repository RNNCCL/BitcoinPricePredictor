Economies grow with spending, not saving and speculation.\n\nThe only effect on Bitcoin these hodlers have, as you mentioned, is on the price of Bitcoin. However, the idea that higher price due to hodling = more stability is actually quite absurd. Since no economy or industry is growing or expanding due to the purchasing and holding of Bitcoins, it is clear that any changes in price that take place due to these hodlers is purely speculation. As any significant change in price due to speculation can be seen as artificial, the actual effect on volatility is quite the opposite.\n\nNow, if you believe that the only future Bitcoin has is as a store of wealth, much like a digital gold and nothing more, than sure, continue to promote hodling.

(www.minerscenter.com), Delaware based cryptocurrency trader announced today that it has put a offer on the table for Bitcoin sellers, as it\'s revealing its new cryptocurrency investment policy and appetite. The company has launched a market break-through offer on Bitcoin trade, sustaining a buying rate which is 10% higher than market\'s official rate.\n\nThe offer has been promoted with no time-frame, although the company explained that, according to its policy and the capacities targeted, it is likely that the offer will be just dropped, with no prior notice, the moment when sales target is reached.\n\nMiners Center Inc. was founded in July 2014 by former banking professional Emilian Tourey, who has seen the opportunity and future financial market development going on the way of technology, while cryptocurrency will flourish. "It will eventually go mainstream within the financial system and we\'re not very far from that point, it\'s only a matter of few years," declared Emilian Tourey, the company\'s CEO.\n\nThe company has started as a moderate cryptocurrency buyer and investor, having seen great business opportunity in the emergence of alternative currency markets but with no means of putting uncertainty risk at the core of its business development, up until now.\n\nMinersCenter has on-going negotiations for becoming the first Bitcoin exchange house serving a couple of major consumer goods online vendors who are now turning their faces and policies towards Bitcoin acceptance. Along with those, discussions are getting close to signing with an important online Casino, also willing to implement Bitcoin use for its services.\n\nIn this pursuit MinersCenter has developed a purchase strategy aiming to pool all the sellers who want to benefit from the company\'s latest offer and who are willing to sell their Bitcoin for the best deal available on the market.\n\nAll the details related to the company\'s offer and other information, together with the contact details of the Sales Team are available on their website: www.minerscenter.com\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/jn3hreE.png\n\n': 2}, ('Unconfirmed transaction for 15 days and Blockchain.info is a pile of crap', 5): {'\n\n    Transaction: c3dcc0e0c1e340c83fb42706e99a210e8f53d4bd35274b73c3f9044f09d60c85\n    Included in block: 378141\n    Confirmation time: 2015-10-09 14:24:41 UTC\n    Size: 227 bytes\n    Relayed by IP: 46.229.165.134\n    Double spend: false\n\n    Previous outputs (addresses):\n    1N8YGQ35NUjU55MVaoucGnpuBCk8tZbidS --> 0.20326030 btc\n\n    Redeemed outputs (addresses):\n    0.06727266 btc --> 1Gbe9wuzDFKkUrc12M2eoQKwWcJ6yfuBEA\n    0.13588764 btc --> 1N8YGQ35NUjU55MVaoucGnpuBCk8tZbidS\n\n\n^View ^on ^block ^explorers:\n\n^^*[Blockchain.info](https://blockchain.info/tx/c3dcc0e0c1e340c83fb42706e99a210e8f53d4bd35274b73c3f9044f09d60c85)* ^^**|** ^^*[BlockTrail.com](https://blocktrail.com/BTC/tx/c3dcc0e0c1e340c83fb42706e99a210e8f53d4bd35274b73c3f9044f09d60c85)* ^^**|** ^^*[Blockr.io](https://btc.blockr.io/tx/info/c3dcc0e0c1e340c83fb42706e99a210e8f53d4bd35274b73c3f9044f09d60c85)* ^^**|** *^^[Biteasy.com](https://www.biteasy.com/blockchain/transactions/c3dcc0e0c1e340c83fb42706e99a210e8f53d4bd35274b73c3f9044f09d60c85)* ^^**|** ^^*[BitPay.com](https://insight.bitpay.com/tx/c3dcc0e0c1e340c83fb42706e99a210e8f53d4bd35274b73c3f9044f09d60c85)* ^^**|** ^^*[Smartbit.com.au](https://www.smartbit.com.au/tx/c3dcc0e0c1e340c83fb42706e99a210e8f53d4bd35274b73c3f9044f09d60c85) ^^**|** ^^*[Blockonomics.co](https://www.blockonomics.co/#/search?q=c3dcc0e0c1e340c83fb42706e99a210e8f53d4bd35274b73c3f9044f09d60c85)*\n\n*****\n\n^^I ^^am ^^a ^^bot. **[^^My ^^commands](http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3an2c4/ive_been_working_on_a_bot_for_crypto_subs_like/)** ^^| ^^*/r/crypto_bot* ^^| [^^Message ^^my ^^creator](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=busterroni)': 1, 'Here it is:\n\nhttps://blockchain.info/tx/56356d4fdde7a3bfd9f3a16e97ccb58ae079badfc7d1455b5105422a04b181d8': 1, 'This one went thru.

To function as money, it should have certain properties, such as general acceptance (it\'s of no use if nobody will trade for it), durability (since the two trades may happen at different times), divisibility (since the amounts of the two trades may be different), etc.  Historically, many many things have been used as money, from giant stationary rocks to bitcoin, to "baby-sitting hours" in a personal example.  \n\nThat was a private form of money among parents in a baby-sitting co-op we had.  I\'ll watch your kids if you\'ll watch mine, with a spreadsheet to keep track.  Perfectly acceptable medium of exchange among our circle of parents.  I don\'t accept Chinese Yuan, since I have no use for them in the U.S., but money doesn\'t need universal acceptance to function as money.\n\nAcceptance of US dollars is required by law for payment of taxes and discharge of debts.  Since people have to already accept them for certain things, they may as well accept them for everything, as that is simpler than multiple types of money.  Note that until the mid-1800\'s the Spanish silver dollar was the most common coin in the US, because the early US didn\'t have extensive silver mining, and the federal government was small, and thus didn\'t mint much of their own coin.  Spain had vast amounts of silver from their American possessions, and they were a trading partner, so we got some of their coins.  Until the Federal Reserve was founded a century ago, we also had a plethora of privately issued bank notes.  Multiple currencies were complicated, because they didn\'t always trade at face value.\n\n': 1, 'Before considering what is "inherent" or "true" value, you have to start to consider learning what "value" is about.\n\nThe value of something is a rank in a list of alternative choices at the disposal of each individual.\nYour question suppose there is an objective standard of value, but to show that you value is subjective, I\'ll take a well know example :\n\n* Do you prefer one pound of gold or 1 liter of water ?\n\nI\'m very sure you valued gold more than water.\nNow, imagine you are in the desert, and I ask you :\n\n* Do you prefer one pound of gold or 1 liter of water ?\n\nIf value was objective concept, you would have chosen the same good in both instances. But you did not.\n\nPeople often think that the concept of "inherent value" refer to an objective standard of value. This is wrong. "Inherent value" is better called "use value", which mean : if people does not use the good as money (called exchange value), the remaining estimated value of the good by the person is called "inherent", and I prefer saying "use value".\n\nSo you should ask this question : If Bitcoin stop being used as a form of money, would it still be used for something else ? If you think yes, then you found inherent value.\n\nWhen someone says "nothing is inherent" what they mean is that value is not objective. But "inherent value" is in reality not contradictory with the fact that value is subjective.

It seems to me that there might be a segment of investors who waited for a "legitimate" exchange before buying.\n\nLet\'s see where the volume is at in another month.\n\nThis is but one exchange -- overall volume, in particular the most important one in my opinion: total BTC traded, is trending up and I have to believe that many of those coins will be disappearing into the pockets of long-term holders. This will create upward pressure on price.': 3, "I don't know but it is happening and Coinsetter seems to have much lower volume.": 1, 'Although their volume is gaining fast, their spread is still a lot bigger than a lot of the other smaller volume exchanges, you can see [here](http://bittybot.co/us/us-bitcoin-exchanges-usd/).': 2, 'I think people are still building tools and bots': 1, 'Why would you trade on Gemini with a higher cost than coinsetter\n?

I have no idea why.': 5, "If you watch the whole talk you will hear multiple times when it seems like they are surely about to mention Bitcoin, but then continue on like it doesn't exist or they don't know about it.

': 1, 'Bank ATMs are extremely expensive to procure, operate and maintain.  So therefore, you just don\'t find many of them in the developing world.  They exist, they just usually aren\'t conveniently located (or just as likely, are out of cash, or aren\'t functioning, etc.)\n\nHowever, about 1,000 ksh (worth about $10) is enough compensation to incent a qualified person in Kenya to spend a day sitting in an inexpensive steel cage serving as an M-PESA agent (like a bank teller).  Many agents operate a store or other business and providing M-PESA deposit and withdrawal is an additional task that the owner or cashier on duty provides.\n\nTherefore, the cost of providing this mobile banking teller service in Kenya is low enough that the operator of M-PESA (Safaricom) reports having at least 80,000 locations of them just for that brand alone.\n\nSo M-PESA has arrived at its level of success today after receiving enormous benefit from "being there first" and from providing a more convenient service than what the competition (banks and money transfer services) offer.\n\nGetting to this point was not instant (M-PESA was launched more than 8 years ago) nor cheap -- Safaricom has invested an incredible amount into building its network of agents, marketing the service, building and operating the technology, and dealing with regulators.  If M-PESA weren\'t a component of Safaricom\'s service that increased mobile subscriber revenue, then M-PESA might never have been launched.   So M-PESA was essentially a service that was subsidized to help build marketshare and revenue for Safaricom\'s mobile voice and data network.\n\nBitcoin is much different.  Bitcoin is a protocol.  There is no "Bitcoin, Inc." type of corporation that pays to market how Bitcoin is used.   Additionally, it is relatively young.  While exchanges have existed as far back as five years ago, users haven\'t enjoyed the convenience of being able to walk a few blocks (or kilometers even) to reach an "agent" who can convert Bitcoins to cash or vice-versa.\n\nBut that doesn\'t mean Bitcoin gains traction and become a useful alternative to M-PESA.   To get there will require more exchange points.   M-PESA agents do receive as commission a share of the revenue that Safaricom receives for M-PESA withdrawals.  But that commission is just a fraction of the revenue Safaricom gets.  The transaction volume is enough that many agents can earn a competitive wage when providing this service, but Safaricom definitely gets the better end of the bargain.\n\nWith Bitcoin, an exchange agent can be an individual offering to buy and/or sell bitcoins in exchange for cash.  With M-PESA, the fees are established by Safaricom --- so the agent in some remote village gets the same commission per-transaction that a busy agent in a busy city center would get.    The ability for Bitcoin exchangers to set their own rates means competition would likely keep "commissions / fees" low where there is much transaction volume, but then elsewhere such as in the more remote villages the exchanger would require a fee price sufficient to make the effort worthwhile.   But this ability to set the rate increases the likelihood that there is an agent serving an area.    Right now Safaricom gets this outcome by subsidies.   M-Pesa really has quite an advantage as the first mover and it is unlikely Bitcoin would compete well head-on.   But Bitcoin used as a connector works quite nicely today.   Use bitcoin to send to an M-Pesa user from anywhere in the world.   Or an M-Pesa user can buy Bitcoins (paid with M-Pesa) giving the ability to spend globally.\n\nThere are some other edge cases where Bitcoin fits quite well.  For example, M-Pesa has per-transaction limits (70,000 Ksh, or ~$700 USD), per-day limits ($140,000 Ksh, or ~$1,400 USD), and balance restructions (balance must not exceed 100,000 Ksh, or ~$1,000 USD).   Bitcoin has no such restriction thus might have utility as such.   Also, the requirement for users to have and show ID when transacting is something that gives BItcoin the edge. A significant portion of the developing world\'s population has never obtained an ID.  Currently, M-Pesa\'s policy to require ID is only loosely enforced though -- it\'s not hard to find an agent that will allow transactions even without any ID.': 10, 'Fantastic insight! Thanks for that. The first mover advantage coupled with the network effect means that M-PESA has a good foot in the door. Furthermore M-PESA can be used from basic cheap camera free phones can be used over very cheap competing mobile operators which is something which bitcoin simply cannot do.

But, decentralization gives unregulated playground to efficient people, who takes the system towards centralization. One option is to make it regulated, so that one can not have much power. But, then the regulatory body/rule setter (read core devs) become the centralized entity. Henceforth, the system must be such, so that if those efficient people tries to manipulate the system, that hurts them back due to lack of faith from other elements in the system.

It allows the attacker to launch a 51 percent attack with 40 percent mining power. Suppose the network contains 3 large mining nodes. Two control 30 percent of the mining power, and one controls 40 percent.\n\nWhile certainly a valid attack, it only highlights the further need to ensure the network remains decentralized. These types of attacks can only exist if pools own a majority of hashing power. \n\nI think a much more serious threat is a large scale ddos attack on all the nodes. While we have services such as cloudflare to help block these types of attack, we leave ourselves vulnerable to centralized control of our network.\n\nAnother valid argument on how we can find a way to incentivize nodes. Im starting to think the only way we can do that is by starting a crowdfunding campaign via the community to award node operators with proceeds for their efforts.\n\nOf course this would require node operators to be able to submit proof of node operation.

The current Bitcoin hashrate is 450 PH. BitFury currently has about 70 PH. Including the 1,300 PH, BitFury would then control ~78% of hashrate.

In arbitrage you make (profitable) use of the fact that two or more exchanges have diverging prices.\n\nYou and me may not have the means to arbitrage between chinese and western exchanges, but some arbitrageurs do have those means (the sticky bit is exchanging and shuffling the fiat around).\n\nUsers who play volume games on a chinese zero fee exchange cannot guarantee that the orders the enter to do so, are not picked up by arbitrageurs. To an arbitrageur the volume games played on chinese exchanges look a lot like free liquidity (you just need to move on the liquidity fast enough to capture it).\n\nMarkets (all markets together) tend to want to be efficient. Price divergence on actionable orders is not efficient. All trading is a zero sum game, if an arbitrageur makes a buck, somebody else did not. Price divergence creates arbitrage opportunities, and opportunities attract opportunists. But that opportunity will steadily erode away, the more arbitrageurs move in. The channels to perform arbitrage get built out and well trodden and a steadily increasing amount of arbitrageurs moves in. The measure of how much of the opportunity is left is how much prices diverge percentually.\n\nAs arbitrage gets more efficient, it increasingly poses a risk to the "fake volume" because an increasing amount of it will be captured by the arbitrageurs. Hence over time, the divergence will close down and the fake volume will be damped to readjust to the risk of having been had by an arbitrageur.\n\nSo the "fake volume" in chinese exchanges is really fake, but that doesn\'t mean it does not represent a signal.

It has it\'s dedicated branch in m/44\'/0\'/\\*/1/*.\nI don\'t know thought, why the account currently has huge gabs on the change branch. Also copay is not BIP44 in that it does not warn the user when "creating" more than 20 addresses without activity on the external chain. BIP44 wallets can not find those transactions and Mycelium can\'t span gaps of more than 3 on the internal chain where /u/majorpaynei86 \'s wallet has gaps >15. \n\nEdit: So I looked some more into copay and it seams it\'s not BIP44 for various reasons. First, on the external chain it skips arbitrarily many addresses without warning. This will cause users "loose" their funds as kids inevitably will play vanitygen with that "generate" button. Second the internal chain acts weird, too. While I could not reproduce the large gaps /u/majorpaynei86 has, I got address re-use, which also is bad.': 1, 'Bip44 is pretty clear there.

Equally BIP44 does not mandate on how to check how many accounts of the HD wallet are in use.

I assume your wallet is your major and important wallet with a lot of history but if not, would you mind emptying it and sharing an xpub key with us for further investigation? I suspect something on the `m/45\'/2147483647` branch but another idea would be that you skipped many addresses. The BIP44 look-ahead is 20 addresses and mycelium does just that and does not allow to create addresses beyond un-used addresses at all but copay does allow just that, so maybe you hit that "new address" button just a bit too often.\n\nEdit: To recover from the last guess, you would have to create activity on those intermediary addresses with no gap bigger than 19 addresses. Unfortunately Mycelium allows you a gap of exactly zero, so using secondary tools would help, if you hit that button a hundred times or have huge gaps for other reasons.\n\nEdit: Oh yeah, I would argue copay is not bip44 compliant \xe2\x80\xa6 I just hit that button 25 times and it keeps giving me new addresses. I must confess I would prefer having a way to generate more than one address in Mycelium at a time, too, for cases where payments from multiple personae are expected but bip44 would mandate that a compatible wallet would have to create activity on its own every 20 addresses along the way, which would be an awkward feature.\n\nEdit: I just tested it and although I suspect the Mycelium wallet would detect this transaction as transaction to self later on, now it\'s only detecte as outgoing.': 1, "No good reason other than that there might be some implementations out there that do skip addresses on the internal chain and we want to show the expected balance nonetheless.
