Probably people will pay for "gas" on Ethereum primarily with Btc imo, especially if Bitcoin retains it\'s nr.1 spot as "internet money" which it most likely will.\n\nThis is mainly the problem Btc has atm imo, People can place their DAO and Dapps and whatnot on Ethereum without much if any loss really as Bitcoin can be seamlessly integrated within it and function fully as it would have purely on the Bitcoin chain.\n\nSo it\'s like why choose to stick with A when option B gives you both A and B\n\n>They will take a hit by pivoting, but they could still succeed over the long-term\n\nI strongly disagree. Atm if you want to crowdfund a dapp or start a DAO you are better of using the Ethereum client than if you did it via Bitcoin at this moment.

See OISC) and the ability to change an arbitrary amount of memory (e.g., the ability to maintain an arbitrary number of variables). Since this is almost always the case, most (if not all) imperative languages are Turing complete if the limitations of finite memory are ignored.': 1, 'This post is Money.. :)': 1, 'Great to hear, /u/ryancarnated!

Today we have HTTP/2, which could have been conceived many many years ago, but it's here and it's working and it's backwards-compatible.\n\nBetter solutions than JavaScript as the scripting language of the web were proposed. JavaScript was continuously declared doomed, incomplete, silly, a toy, etc, compared to other languages. JavaScript evolved, became faster (thanks to JIT and tracing compilers), incorporated better syntax and features.\n\nIt's very easy to see the rise of an incredibly exciting technology (Bitcoin) and poke holes at it and claim that you'll take the idea, re-brand it and make it better.\n\nWhat's hard is to evolve the existing system. There are lots of variables in play, compatibility with existing systems, politics and people to deal with.

If you still don\'t understand mods\' encouragement of the BIP consensus process or the sub\'s policy against non-consensus clients, I\'m not sure what else I can tell you.\n\nThe consensus process of Bitcoin is not the BIP-process, it is nodes that decide what blocks are accepted or not. The BIP-process is a way for developers to formulate and propose changes to the Bitcoin-protocol. It also serves the purpose of informing the community of what the proposed changes are and for developers to champion changes. It is not ***the*** consensus process of Bitcoin, it is the consensus process of developers. What the consensus process really is what blocks are accepted by full nodes or not. \n\nIf you are to continue using the term "non-consensus clients", I think you should amend it to include information on these clients not being in agreement with the developer community that disagrees with it (for example, Core disagrees with Classic and vice versa). \n\n> At this point, it\'s clear that Mike Hearn was no friend of Bitcoin and plenty of evidence evidence that he abandoned the consensus process and attempted to force himself into a dictatorial role.\n\nHow is it clear that "Mike Hearn was no friend of Bitcoin", how did he abandon the consensus process and force himself into a dictatorial role?
