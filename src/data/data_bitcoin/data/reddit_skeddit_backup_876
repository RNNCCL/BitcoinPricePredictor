Look at his comments further down on this thread here: https://twitter.com/twobitidiot/status/510220079565651968\n\nThey even have a Marketing white paper: http://www-01.ibm.com/common/ssi/cgi-bin/ssialias?subtype=XB&infotype=PM&appname=GBSE_GB_TI_USEN&htmlfid=GBE03620USEN&attachment=GBE03620USEN.PDF#loaded\n\nDirect Link to PDF: http://public.dhe.ibm.com/common/ssi/ecm/en/gbe03620usen/GBE03620USEN.PDF\n\nBasically, they are betting on a few things:\n\n1. End of embedded computing: End of embedded computing as we know it where a lot of special purpose chips were designed for specific purposes. Instead, in the future, System-on-chip technology (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_on_a_chip) will be widely used. This implies that even a light bulb can have the full computing power of the first smartphone within a few years. \n\n2. Secure Distributed Data Sharing: Subsequently, you will have hundreds of billions of computers running out in the wild (aka "Internet of Things"). And they may be from a million different companies, some of which might have gone out of business a decade before your children were born. (Remember, there are several industrial as well as home products, such as your furniture, which are built to run for several years, if not decades.) How do you let them communicate securely with each other? Enter Telehash (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telehash). It is a peer-to-peer data distribution and communication protocol, which lets the devices run on an edge or \xe2\x80\x9cMesh\xe2\x80\x9d network (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesh_networking). No longer does the communication between these devices need to be routed through expensive central servers.\n\n3. Private, secure and trustless transactions logged in a Block Chain: IBM\xe2\x80\x99s key insight is that everything on the Internet, including within IoT, is a \xe2\x80\x9ctransaction\xe2\x80\x9d. Whether a user logs on to a service or a light bulb decides to borrow power from the fan nearby, everybody is performing a transaction, whether in cash or in kind. However, you cannot trust any of these devices even though you want to interface with everything in the world. So, you log all these digital transactions on a Block Chain and discredit those transactions that are malicious. According to IBM, \xe2\x80\x9cRules could also be defined by 51 percent consensus, as in the case of devices agreeing on the safety of peer downloadable software updates or banning a misbehaving participant.\xe2\x80\x9d I\xe2\x80\x99m skeptical about how this would be trustworthy enough unless they use the Bitcoin block chain. \n\nPaul Brody does mention on Twitter that \xe2\x80\x9cWe are forking Ethereum.\xe2\x80\x9d (https://twitter.com/pbrody/status/510311550734073856) \n\nSo they could fork Ethereum and create their own block chain. However, this is still up for debate I guess.\n\nAn important thing to understand is that IBM and Samsung will only provide a Proof of Concept and a \xe2\x80\x9creference implementation\xe2\x80\x9d of this network of things in January at CES. Since the system is supposed to be made completely open source, the Internet of Things and Bitcoin community could subsequently contribute or even take over/fork the project.\n\nDefinitely exciting, and not to be dismissed immediately, in my opinion.': 13, 'In DPOS each delegate is signing or checkpointing,  this is decentralised.

The two are not at odds.\n\n*BitShares X is an experiment to test the economic theory behind a new kind of prediction market. This experiment creates a decentralized bank and exchange that uses a decentralized transaction ledger secured by DPOS to create fungible digital assets that are market-pegged to the value of anything from dollars, to gold, to gallons of gasoline. Like all DACs, BitShares X has shares that can be transferred between users in the same way as Bitcoin. What makes BitShares X special is that it also implements a business model similar to existing banks or brokerages.\n\nBitShares X can create BitUSD by lending it into existence backed by collateral in the same way that the banking system lends dollars into existence today. Whereas your bank uses your house as collateral, BitShares X uses BTSX as collateral. If the value of the collateral falls relative to BitUSD then BitShares X will automatically cover your loan by selling the BTSX held as collateral for BitUSD and giving the borrower the BTSX is left over.\n\nThe reason someone borrows BitUSD is for the purpose of executing a short sell of BitUSD relative to BTSX. This works in the same manner as shorting a stock. First, you borrow the stock, then you sell it at todays high prices. If all goes well then you can buy it back tomorrow for less than you paid today, pay off your loan, and keep the profit. However, if things go against you then you will have to pay more to buy back the stock than you sold it for in the first place and thus take a loss.\n\nBitUSD is created when two people taking opposite positions can agree to a price and the only price at which two people will agree is the current market price of USD in BTSX otherwise one individual will start out losing money. The mechanics of the market peg are very similar to the mechanics of a prediction market. Once the market has reached a consensus that BitUSD should be valued the same as a real US Dollar no one will be able to trade against that consensus without losing money. Thus the value of BitUSD today is based upon the prediction of what market participants will value BitUSD at in the future. There is only one rational way to speculate, that the consensus will hold, and that creates a self-enforcing market peg.\n\nWith BitShares X all short positions (those borrowing BitUSD) must start out with enough BTSX as collateral to purchase 2x the USD borrowed. Margin calls are executed when the value of the collateral falls to 1.5x the amount borrowed. This gives the market ample opportunity to cover the short position and pay off the loan before there is insufficient collateral. In the event that the market is forced to execute a margin call, a 5% fee will be assessed. This should encourage participants to be pro-active in maintaining sufficient margin.\n\nIn the rare event that the value of BTSX falls by more than 50% in less than an hour resulting in insufficient collateral, 100% of the collateral will be used to cover as much BitUSD as possible leaving some BitUSD uncovered. The result of this price movement is that some BitUSD will be in circulation without any backing which may or may not impact the market peg of BitUSD to USD. We have two hypothesis as to the market response in this event: in one case the BitUSD will start trading at a discount proportional to the surplus BitUSD in circulation, in the other case the market expectation of a peg to USD will override any surplus supply and BitUSD will continue trading as before. This would be similar to how the dollar did not see an immediate fall to 0 value despite being removed from the gold standard.*': 3, 'Another shitcoin... is it a surprise?': 1, 'Yeah... that article comes across as a bit too confrontational for my taste. \n\nBut the technology behind BitShares is actually really cool and game-changing.

By rejecting (not broadcasting) TXs crafted to take advantage of mempool-acceptance heterogeneity, the merchant can reduce the risk of zero-confirm fraud.  \n\n- By inspecting the X.509 certificate attached to the payment request, the user\'s mobile devices will eventually be able to show "Pay 5,240 bits to Starbucks Coffee" rather than the more cryptic "Pay 0.00524 BTC to 16c5JFDLCHK3eukrLYFcwmZtvCujSDfRBo."\n\n- Devices without an internet connection or a power supply could still pay using the same BIP70+OpenNFC protocol (imagine a NFC version of Trezor).  \n\n*I should note that, AFAIK, the NFC on the Schildbach wallet simply uses URIs to encode the payment request, such that the device making the payment broadcasts the TX to the network rather than passing the signed TX back over NFC.

This is interesting because it will be a decentralized, democratic method of currency control) This aspect of the design of the protocol and consensus network means Ripple will start completely centralized (as has been noted often) and through gradual adoption by gateways (banks, exchanges, merchants, governments, individuals) will become increasingly more decentralized (opposite of Bitcoin mining network)\n\nAn interesting and controversial new feature (Probably not popular on this sub) was released today: they introduced optional \'Freezing\' for gateway IOUs, a step they chose to add to enable gateways to comply with KYC and AML regulations. Fidor bank in Germany has started its trials with cross border wire transfers last month and rumors about a large US bank in talks with Ripple have sprouted on the forums. They have formally joined NACHA, the organization which controls ACH network and are presenting at SIBOS (in Boston in a few weeks) the main conference for the SWIFT network. \n\nAs a payments network it has notable efficiency improvements of the public ledger (blockchain) and directly addresses within the protocol some of the centralized choke points of Bitcoin. As a currency and instrument of financial "disruption" it truly does not hold the same values of the bitcoin community through its implementation and adoption strategy, although it has now (finally) fully released as open source all of the node and client code.\n\nDegree of centralization of both networks is relative and currently rather fluid. As a currency, there is not much competition with Bitcoin\'s decentralization.

Hello fellow ENTP.': 0, '>5) Admit that Bitcoin is not cheaper than credit cards. A common pitch is that bitcoin is much cheaper than credit cards, but this simply is not true in most real-world use cases. Bitcoin merely appears less expensive for most retail transactions because those charging the transaction fees - the miners - care more about the large 25 BTC / block mining reward subsidies than they do the variable transaction fees.\n\nI still can\'t quite get my head round people interpreting seignorage as a fee on all transactions. As I\'ve said before - do you add the $50 billion or so per month of QE over the last year proportionately as a fee on all USD transactions? It doesn\'t matter whether that works out as a small fee or a large fee, the point is - you would never do it, because it\'s ridiculous.\n\nA reduction in the seignorage from 25BTC, to 12.5BTC and beyond affects how much electricity cost can go into mining, which affects the break even point for mining activity, and thus in principle the difficulty (of course you have to factor in the long term real value changes of 1BTC), so it\'s very difficult to predict long term how lower coinbase reward will affect bitcoin mining diff (and therefore bitcoin security .. and I\'m not even trying to factor in how ASIC innovation plays in). But just saying "25BTC has to be added to transaction cost" is ridiculous on its face.\n\nFrom an economics perspective it makes no sense to suppose the 25BTC reward affects anything at all, as it\'s a known in advance cost, not an "innovation" as I think some economists like to put it.\n\nI do understand that the block size limits means transactions are (at least for now) a scarce resource; but the dynamics of the bitcoin system mean that adding more mining power does not help with (or hinder) this problem - the whole point of the difficulty ratchet is to make the absolute amount of hash power irrelevant to bitcoin\'s internal operation. Obviously that is not perfectly true, but that\'s the baseline model.\n\nBitcoin is *profoundly* less expensive than credit card transactions, although the vast majority of the advantage is going to be seen by merchants for now - for consumers (for now) the advantage is mainly in a better security model.': 1}, ('Hello, this is CardFlip.com saying "Hello!"', 15): {"Yep.

Say you have 1 Bitcoin and you no longer want to hold it when the price falls to $400, so you'd place a stop loss at $400. When the price hits that point, your pending stop loss order turns into a market order to sell 1 BTC, 'stopping' your loss. \n\nHowever, because it's a market order, that sale will occur at the best price available on the moment your pending order triggers. If volatility is very high, you might experience slippage and the order might be filled at a worse spot than you originally planned (this depends on volatility, liquidity, as well as how good the exchange works), so a stop order isn't perfect, but it's still a good enough protection protection against losses. (there are exceptions; stop loss orders are completely worthless in REALLY high volatility environments, like leveraged foreign exchange trading during news events)\n\nA trailing stop loss order is what it says, a stop order that trails the price. Say you bought 1 BTC at $300, but you would like to sell and stop your loss if BTC drops $50 in value. A trailing stop loss order automatically adjusts your stop loss up, always trailing behind the price, in this case by $50, and it only triggers if BTC ever drops $50 from its last high. So if the BTC you bought at $300 first goes to $600 and then drops $50, your trailing stop loss order would automatically trigger at $550 and attempt to sell your BTC at the best price available at that time. \n\nThe reason why this might create spikes is that people are people and thus psychologically predictable. People attach value to round numbers, such as $500, or $400, or they perceive a certain resistance/support/trend-line as important, and thus they'll cluster stop loss orders around those places. A savvy trader with enough cash could hypothetically attempt to run the price to those psychologically significant stops through selling BTC. Doing so would trigger stop loss orders which turn into market sell orders which depress the price further, most likely hitting other stop loss orders and essentially creating a downwards price cascade. On exchanges with very little liquidity, like BTC-E, this happens more frequently because fewer people take advantage of such sudden drops in value. \n\nConversely, in a market that supports short positions, this also works to the upside. Short positions that are protected by stop loss orders are basically pending orders to buy when the price reaches a certain point. A whole bunch of short positions closing, driving the price up, is commonly called a 'short squeeze'. \n\nHowever, trying to depress or drive a price up is not an amazing tactic and still carries a lot of risk.

Compare it to music/movies and bittorrent in that it is peer to peer, however the distributed network is able to form agreement on the transfer of assets (versus just making copies of digital files).  How Bitcoin is the first implementation of distributed consensus.  It is a protocol for transferring ownership, standardized and usable much like email or http used on the Internet without regard to computer manufacturer. Advantages of an open protocol being that it is distributed around the globe, and usable by anyone. It is not under the control of any corporation or group of individuals. Person-to-person payments are just the first capability, like email was in 1994 before web browsers, so many more capabilities can be built on top of it, just as Facebook/Twitter/Reddit were built on the http protocol.  This brings capabilities to the individual, rather than institutions, such as multi-signature accounts and escrow, which can substantially reduce fraud and financial abuse.\n\nIn the Q&A you can probably discuss mining and how it secures the ledger. Advantages to the customer and to merchants and to the merchant's supply chain via reduced fees and instant transfer of value globally.
