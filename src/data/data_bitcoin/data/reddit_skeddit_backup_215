Eh... That\'s a real stretch buddy. "I\'m not willing to pay a $25 fee to override the shady goings-on for the $.10 fee network on my $2.50 coffee tx." What\'s the use case on the LN side?

Your skepticism of a new Bitcoin technology is well founded. \n\n> Exactly!\n\nCool, we\'re getting somewhere! \n\n> so you open a 50/50 channel which costs you\n\nAn important question is how much is in the channel?\n\n> it doesn\'t go through\n\nWhat\'s "doesn\'t go through" entail? In the case that the HTLC doesn\'t fully propagate due to an unresponsive peer, the commitment transaction still has an ample fee attached to it, and you\'ll be able to claim all funds after the "pay-to-self" CSV timeout. \n\nThinking about this a bit more, I think this (your concern) only applies in the case of a highly asymmetric channel. For the case of a highly asymmetric channel (Alice 1, Bob 0, opened this way), Alice may want to require a floor on the amount of money sent to Bob in a single HTLC. Also, due to issues with HTLC timing, you essentially never want to *fully* exhaust either side of the channel. \n\nIn the symmetric case, even if Bob attempts to cheat you by stealing a previous HTLC payment that\'s below the current fee, you still have financial incentive to create a new tx taking this HTLC *and* his current balance. This is due to the fact that Bob will previously settled funds still in this commitment transaction, which you can take entirely. \n\nAdditionally, this may not be a practice due to the way we\'re currently experimenting with fee schedules for the network. Remember that you\'ll be able to earn money yourself passively, by forwarding payments. Optimally, you\'d like your channels to remain as balanced as possible, since this allows you full utilization of your channel bandwidth. If you\'re able to regularly forward payments, you\'ll gain more in fees. The fee schedule may not be simple "flat-rates", but instead a non-linear function of the current "balance ratio" of your channel. As an example: if your channel looks like (You: 5BTC, Them: 20 BTC), you\'ll advertise very low fees to move funds in the direction towards "them" as this results in your channel state being closer to equilibrium. Conversely, if your channel state looks like (You: 0.5 BTC, Them: 24.5 BTC), and someone wants to send a payment in your direction, you\'d change them a much higher fee than in the previous scenario. For simplicity, this ignores the concept of "negative fees". \n\n\n> Let\'s contrast this with the same scenario with wide open blocks and no fee market.\n\nNo fee market? At some point in Bitcoin\'s future, the amount of fees must likely outweigh the current subsidy in order to incentivize miners to still participate in the network.

If someone could back out completely before the channel closes,  it would be much worse than a chargeback.\n\n>Bare HTCL\'s will be required to have a payment above the dust limit (or else they won\'t get relayed!), so in reality this won\'t be a problem.\n\nRelayed is not confirmed.  In a small block / fee market scenario there would be many transactions above the \'dust\' relay limit that never make it into a block before the channel timeout.

Bitcoin has no such central individual soliciting outsider funds, and nobody promises a fixed or even high return. \n\nBitcoin is also not a pyramid scheme because a pyramid scheme functions by taking money from new recruits (at the base of the pyramid) and then moving that money up the pyramid, where it loses a % at every level, until it reaches the head honcho. There is no pyramid structure in bitcoin, because anyone can pay anyone else to enter, and that money doesn\'t get funneled up the pyramid. It goes to whomever sold you the bitcoins, and they spend the money however they want.

Their devs actually wrote BIP 39. Are the addresses fine?\n\n>I am able to recover a 24 word seed that is generated on this site and load it into my trezor. All of the generated public keys match up perfectly. The xPub key is never the same though.\n\nIf the xpub is different but you're generating the same addresses you're looking at different xpubs. I'm assuming you want the master key but you may be looking at an account xpub or something.\n\n>I am also able to load the xPub that trezor generates into mycelium as a watch only, but I am not able to load the generated xPub from this site. Can someone explain why?\n\nTrezor probably gives you whatever key Mycelium wants, which is probably the master xpub. I don't know which xpub Mycelium wants though, maybe an Account?\n\n>Does anyone know of another website that generates Bip39 seeds and has an xPub that aligns with trezor? I know trezor supplies github python and javascript code. I personally do not have the time at the moment to program this.\n\nAll proper BIP 39 implementations should work with Trezor I believe. They shouldn't generate different keys, Trezor wrote the BIP.\n\n>I think it would be great to have a website similar to https://dcpos.github.io/bip39/ that allows you to generate for electrum, mycelium, trezor, ledger, case, and keepkey. I am willing to pay for this, with bitcoin of course, so I can generate these offline securely.  Thanks.\n\nIf you're serious about this post in /r/Jobs4Bitcoins. Just keep in mind a big point of BIP39 is to work across most implementations. If you're having problems it's likely a result of lack of understanding and the tools not being particularly helpful. It'd be largely redundant to have this made IMO.\n\nIf you're talking about the wallet formats that website supports BIP44 which is a pretty safe bet for most decent wallets in my experience. It even lets you input your own BIP32 format!\n\nEdit: Typo": 1, "Oh cool so it was just an issue of the tool displaying a different xpub. Sorry I couldn't help more!

His description was (and I\'m paraphrasing): "Blockchains are a unique type of database in which the individual entries are owned, rather than the entire database being owned." This because of the fact that a private key is necessary to move a bitcoin from address A to address B.\n\nHowever, this definition is *incomplete* and *unworkable* without proof-of-work, and Satoshi knew this in 2009.

However, there are not fully out the box solutions that utilize this feature as of this writing.\n\nIf you expect to pass them in on the next 20 years, I would go about it this way:\n\n1. Using Electrum - generate a new wallet from seed, and make it password protected.  Send small amounts to this address to confirm it works, that you can spend from it, that it is password protected, and that you can recover the seed, and that recovering it, the coin is still password protected.\n1. create a different wallet/seed/and different password for each wallet you intend to bequeath.  If you intend to give 3 persons bitcoin, make 3 different wallets with different recovery seeds and passkeys\n1. On your will - list the public addresses per each heir - ~~if you don\'t want them knowing how much each receives, you can change the text to say \'Address ending in N4jf19X" for each listed address - to give a way for each individual heir to verify what they received.~~ I agree with /u/infinitechan that ANY string can be looked up and examined on a block explorer.  \n1. Use two locations to hold the data - you will NEED both pieces to unlock the coins so it makes no sense to keep your only copy of one someplace insecure like a home or buried somewhere - unless you saved the data on [punched steel cards](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/cryptosteel-the-ultimate-cold-storage-wallet#/) (which would work fine and be more resilient).\n\nPreferably, keep the unlock pins with the attorney so that at the time of the reading, the Lawyer can distribute the unlock pins to the individual heirs - but keep the private keys and the pins safe!  put the private keys in a safety deposit box or use that punched steel solution I\'ve shown to you above.  \n\nThis method will allow you to recover the bitcoin but require a password to spend or use them, so it protects the cache from one bad actor trying to sweep the funds later.\n\n\nNow, if you have an Executor that you trust such as a Wife or favored son or daughter, you have a few more options - There\'s something called a Co-Pay (by bitpay)  its a wallet that would allow you to easily setup a wallet that requires multiple persons to agree before funds can be spent - ideally you would setup the wallet to be something like 9 of 15 - that means you created 15 different private keys, but 9 of them are required to spend from the wallet - something like that would allow flexibility without needing to procure a safety deposit box and you could conceivably print the backup seeds or store them on a USB drive.\n\nFinally, there\'s something called Shor\'s algorythm- its the exact same thing I  had described above with copay, except you can actually do the exact same thing, on paper!  using https://bitaddress.org, split wallet does this. its free!:\n\n1. save a copy of the website to your PC on the desktop.\n1. disconnect your computer from the internet.\n1. open the saved webpage that you saved on the desktop.\n1. follow directions use split wallet and set it for the number of keys generated and the number of keys needed to spend the funds.\n1.

You got it! :) (if you don\'t mind sending a shipping address to info[at]cacao.farm, as soon as we have a bar ready, we\'ll send you one free of charge.) In regards of the price per bar, yes, it may seem a bit high. This is one is kind of a "fund raiser" bar, but we are aiming at the average pricing of most bean to bar craft chocolate. Definitely not https://toakchocolate.com/ ($270 bar) but around guys like http://www.dandelionchocolate.com/ (~$9-11)  Thanks again!': 1}, ('E-Coin Bitcoin Cards: An Interview With Georgy Sokolov', 2): {}, ('Does anyone use coinimal?
