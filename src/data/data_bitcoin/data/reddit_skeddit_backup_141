Those wishing to purchase the good can search for items within a user-requested radius. Sellers list a good as available within a geographic region, subject to some degree of precision, for the purpose of obfuscating their precise location. Goods are announced next to an expiration, a hashtag, and if space permits, a description. Once a buyer finds a good in a defined relative proximity, a secure communication channel is opened between the parties on the Bitcoin test network (\xe2\x80\x9ctestnet\xe2\x80\x9d). Once negotiations are complete, the buyer sends payment to the seller via the address listed on the Bitcoin mainnet. This spend action establishes reputation for the buyer, and potentially for the seller. Once paid, the seller is to furnish the exact GPS coordinates of the good to the buyer (alongside a small note such as \xe2\x80\x9cCheck in the crevice of the tree\xe2\x80\x9d). When the buyer successfully picks up the item at the specified location, the buyer then issues a receipt with a note by spending flake to the address of the original post. In this way, sellers receive a reputation score.\nThe solution is distributed, and as such provides nearly risk-free terms to sellers and drastically reduced risk to buyers."\n\nCheck out r/dropzone for more info ': 5, 'There are reputation features built into the protocol, and additional reputation services will likely pop up. Drones may be an option. \n\n\nEnforcement of laws on the Buyers will be difficult and/or too resource intensive. The risk Buyers carry may be similar to torrenting music. \n\n\nThe important thing to consider is that the risk in markets dealing with censored goods mostly falls on Sellers/Suppliers. Drop Zone drastically reduces the risk for Sellers. In the example of the illegal "Bible" market, the main "Bible" supplier faces significantly less risk when distributing "Bibles" to smaller sellers.

That requires more throughput. So it is by no means cut and dried that bigger blocks = more centralization, or easier to attack. In fact, it is quite plausible that keeping blocks small is overwhelmingly worse on balance for achieving the actual benefits we want from decentralization. \n\nWe should keep in mind that if a Bitcoin2 with 20MB blocks, for example, is at all viable, someone could release that and it could quickly take over a bigger community than Bitcoin now has (of course assuming the Bitcoin doesn't react, which I think it would).

The longer chain would simply be considered invalid and discarded by every other participant of the network.\n\nNow, the question becomes - valid according to what rules?

If I were a merchant, and you tried to pay me coin during a fork, I\'d only accept the coins if they show me being the owner on both chains. If one of the chains showed the coins belonging to someone else, those coins are in my book "compromised". If the coins you paid me are only valid on the small block chain, and the big block chain wins, my money goes away. If both chains show me as the owner, it doesn\'t matter which chain wins, either way I still have my coins.\n\nBy the way, it is very difficult to move your coins one way on one chain, and another way on the other chain. From the node\'s perspective, it has no idea if another node is using a different fork from itself. All the node cares about is if a transaction is valid or not. If it\'s valid it sends it off to other nodes. If it\'s not valid, it doesn\'t pass it along. Theres no way to tell a node to only pass a transaction along to nodes on any particular fork.\n\nYou\'d essentially have to use one of peter todd\'s double spend scripts to sneak one version of the tx to the smallblock nodes, and another version to the bigblock nodes.
