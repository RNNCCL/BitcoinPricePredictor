Suicide is a form of escapism, the ultimate form. The way to end the desire for escapism is to face one\'s fears and discomforts square on, to allow oneself to experience that discomfort in all its force; to get comfortable with discomfort, and then to think logically about those feelings, their cause, all the possible solutions, the best of those solutions, and then to take right action.

My first bout with depression was after being robbed at gunpoint in 1994 when I was working night audit at a hotel and putting myself through engineering school. The first thing doctors do is give you a label [PTSD] and medicate you. The next thing they do is give you other medication to deal with the side effects of the first medication. Then they try psychotherapy and other bullshit treatments that don't really work, or take years or actually make you feel worse. It's medical hacking, and you're the guinea pig. You eventually start reaching for weird shit like acupuncture and meditation and drum lessons and all sorts of other alternative stuff that actually works a whole lot better than the drugs, but not consistently.\n\nPuzzled, I did a bunch of my own research. Eventually I found a book with some very well designed cognitive processes that I applied diligently and got really good and consistent results with. And by results, I mean my mood improved. My good mood could be sustained as long as I kept up with the processes, and the effects appeared to be cumulative.\n\nThe book clearly presents a scale of emotion and then matches cognitive processes to emotional states but lacks a quick cross-reference, so it was clumsy and I would forget to use it. After a year of using it off and on I knew I wanted an app to help me to more easily use the processes, check in with my emotions, log them, and graph them. Being an android user, I sketched a design for an android app. I had no idea when or where the resources or the time or the talent would show up so that it could be developed. I just wanted it to be real, so I made it as real as I could... on paper. I've done UI design before and so I kinda knew what I was doing.\n\nSix months later, my buddy Eric was looking for a new direction in software development. I suggested app development and he agreed so we spent the next two months working at my apartment. When we finished, Eric scored an app development contract and well, I stared using the app. I needed it more than ever as my Mom died a few months later.\n\nThe app, book, and processes helped me through the dark months following my Mom's passing. I was pretty f'd up and I know I wouldn't have been able to cope without the processes and the app to remind me to apply them. But as if one parent wasn't enough, my Dad was diagnosed 6 months later with terminal cancer and a year to live. So I dropped everything and moved from Vancouver to Calgary to be with him during his final year. My Dad passed away in September of this year (2014), and I got to be with him at the moment of death as I was with my Mom when she died. Heavy shit.... no two ways about it. I made a tribute about him. https://vimeo.com/93011046\n\nDespite using the app and book and processes every day for the past two and half years, plans for its release were never realized until a couple months ago. Adjustment to life without my parents has been so much easier with these processes and the app and so it became clear to me that since it had helped me so much through these incredibly difficult times that I had give it away so others could use it. We had originally included the text of the book, but had to strip that out because it wasn't our copyright and the author doesn't seem interested in collaborating. The app and the book are, hence, companions, and you need to have a copy of the book for the app to make the most sense, but it's also interesting on its own.\n\nWe needed a name, so we called it GetAppy (sounds like Get Happy).

If the gamble doesn\'t pay off for the 99% miners, they can simply switch back to the legacy blockchain at little cost to themselves.

If miners successfully pull off their mutiny, people will start dumping the coin for a more trustworthy investment.  The miner\'s own wallets would lose value because of the mass exodus.

If you wanted to, you could go back and change the rules starting at block 20 and easily produce your own chain. However, unless you can convince most of the wallet development teams to change their code, most of the merchants to accept your new coins, and most of the regular users to use this new fork, it is without value.\n\nShould a majority of miners decide to create their own fork, they could  threaten the merchants, developers, and users to switch to the new fork or they will begin 51% attacking the original chain. However, we could simply change our mining algorithm to something other than SHA-256 which would render their ASICs useless and worthless. That would have a cost on the Bitcoin network because there is value in having an established distributed hashrate already in the ASIC stage. The cost on the SHA-256 miners would, however, be greater.\n\nThe Bitcoin ecosystem has these natural checks and balances in place. There are no courts, no legislators, and no politicians.

The only recourse the investors have is to either ride it out until the difficulty re-adjusts potentially months later, or invest in mining equipment and help the network limp along until the re-adjustment.\n\nDifficulty wouldn\'t be a major problem. It would require another hard-fork, but it would be a fork that the developers/merchants/users would likely agree to as opposed to the mining reward change in the miners\' fork. The new change would simply lower the difficulty to a reasonable level. Problem solved.\n\nThe real problem would be the risk of a 51% attack by the miners in order to ruin the original chain and "incentivize" the users/developers/merchants to switch. To counter this would require a less desirable fork than the difficulty adjustment. We would need to switch mining algorithms to something other than SHA-256. This would bring us back to pre-ASIC mining (which I consider a negative) subverting the 51% attack.\n\nThe reason I think going to a pre-ASIC algorithm is bad would be that eventually ASICs will be developed and we\'ll be right back to where we were anyways. One of the hardest parts of this process is the arms race. Every improvement in chip design gives the designing company a temporary huge percent of network hashrate. The point we are reach with ASICs means that no more of these improvement advantages will be had. It is now a matter of physically producing and maintaining the hardware, which is much less centralized.\n\nI would still support such a change if we got in such a situation, however, as the alternative would be adopting the miners\' fork. I suspect most of the developers, merchants, and users would also agree.\n\nOf course, this would all shake confidence in Bitcoin for a while. People don\'t like conflicts between miners and the rest of the network, and they certainly don\'t like changing algorithms. But Bitcoin would continue. Everyone\'s coins would be intact.\n\nAnd since the miners who began this attack in the first place would end up with nearly worthless ASICs, they would be irrational to attempt it.': 8, "> Current cost per transaction (including miner reward) is upwards of $25, so we could be looking at $20 fees per transaction, if not more, if people want their transactions confirmed in a timely manner.\n\nThe point at which a transaction is reasonably secure is when there is more total mining reward in the blocks confirming it than the amount being sent. That's the point at which it would be more expensive to 51% attack than could be recovered by the double spend.\n\nEyeballing [this chart] gives me an average number of transactions per block of around 400. 400*6 gives 2400 transactions in six confirmations. All those fees help secure each other. 1/2400 = 0.042% average transaction fee to make the transactions reasonably secure in six confirmations.\n\nIncreasing the number of transactions per block would bring that down even further.\n\nFrom a security stand point the 25 BTC/block reward is overkill.": 1, "> **the fixed nature of the model is priced in.**\n\nThat's just about all there is to it.

This underscores your lack of understanding of what you are criticizing. \n\nI\'m certainly not one of these people running around screaming that bitcoin is politically neutral.  I\'m all for people of all stripes and persuasions using it; but my understanding of economics leads me to believe with a great deal of surety that bitcoin\'s makeup necessitates the weakening of state power (and the power of other hierarchies) if it is to succeed in garnering the trust and value of a large portion of the earths population.  In this way, I see bitcoin as an inherently anarchic technology . . . .yet, I don\'t think there\'s any cause to think that the protocol necessarily needs to be changed in order to fit the needs of and benefit a diverse range of groups and interests, including statists, "social" anarchists, and individualist anarchists.

There is no hive-mind out there that we can be tapped into if we just put aside our "individual wants" or whatever.  All values, and all wants are individual wants.  There is no such thing as consensus or a "good for society".  There is only going along with certain other peoples\' preferences, because either you are forced to choose between a limited number of options which will be decided by majority vote (and thus one obviously is *closer* to your individual preferences than the other), or there is value to be gained by you personally, and perhaps outside the scope of the current value proposition, by cooperating or going along with another person\'s or group\'s preference.\n\nAll value is subjective to the individual.  All action originates within the mind of the individual.  There is no greater good, or common good, or even democratic values . . .beyond the foolish belief that democracy is the best or only way to handle all questions in society.  \n\nRarely is the marketplace of ideas and human interaction (and yes, even markets for capital and consumers goods) allowed to first operate and provide a diversity of options, to suit the needs of as many differing preferences in society as possible, and to employ technologies (even institutional technologies such as voluntary democratic processes) to help solve and sort out the clash points and negative externalities. \n\nNobody actually wants whatever may come of the application of democratic values. . . .they want what they want.  But what they value are the perceived benefits which they will gain over the opportunity costs of not having any societal order.  This is where economics comes in: people need to be educated as to the other methods of social cooperation (i.e. too often they equate in their minds the absence of democracy necessarily meaning autocracy, or even meaning that their conception of *gasp* anarchy which they falsely equate as meaning no rules and just chaos, will be the inevitable result).\n\nDemocratic solutions. . . while sometimes necessary if some particular property or social convention is completely lacking; are usually simply the gut reactions of the monkey-brains of the masses of incontinent, uneducated, and lazy people (I include myself in this miserable lump of humanity. . . . I won\'t call it our nature; but it is certainly our nurture, and perhaps even some short-term evolutionary advantage can be attributed to this kind of behavior pattern).\n\nIf people can be sufficiently educated and convinced of the value of the lengthening of their time preferences, in order to facilitate the production and growth of social capital (i.e. decentralized social mechanisms vs. the quick and obvious centralized and usually coercive solutions), then we can actually make progress.  Bitcoin itself is an example of that kind of progress; and, in that sense defies the high-time-preferential centralized-state solutions (and even most democratic solutions) to societal problems.\n\nThe very "voting" mechanism of the blockchain defies the conception of majority rule and direct democracy.  It mirrors very closely the "unregulated" markets which many bitcoiners think they abhor.  It is more akin to a voluntary system of governance, wherein votes are only cast by those who have stake (i.e. pay) in the system.  Yeah, 51% attack. . .blah blah.

There is no need to worry about 90% of the nodes rejecting it.\n\nThere are pools out there who will happily take your new 0.0002 fee transaction, and throw away your old 0.0001 transaction. They have an incentive to accept the higher fee. If they were paid to only accept the signed transaction, they have an incentive to continue to provide security against double spends.\n\nSo the entire point here isn't about nodes propagating it, but that it gets to the actual miners directly who are responsible for including it in a block.": 1, "This is horrible.

Block explorers like blockchain.info etc. loosen the transaction relay parameters so it can see more transactions, but in actuality, only a small percentage of nodes stores your transaction in their mempool.\n\nBecause of this, if I sent a transaction with a proper fee that fit the rules of 100% of the network, that double spend transaction will propagate to over 90% of the network, and the nodes that DID accept my first transaction will REJECT the second transaction OUTRIGHT.
