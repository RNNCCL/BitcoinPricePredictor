But also, we have a proof that a _third party_ can't malleable a Schnorr signature without knowledge of the private key. That proof does not transfer onto ECDSA, nor is it obvious how to create such a proof. Without the proof we don't know for certain if it is possible to malleate an ECDSA signature (change the nonce) without knowledge of the private key.": 7, "Are a particular set of signatures/witnesses committed to by the miners?  \n\nI realize this is still early, but this is something we struggled with in our system, and want to know the blockstream guys's line of reasoning.\n\n\nI am guessing the signatures would be in a block footer or something like that.  The question is if the signatures will be hashed into the Merkle tree somehow, or just be loosely coupled and malleable themselves.  Will there be a parallel Merkle root of the balance information in the coinbase input or in a coinbase OP_RETURN?\n\n\n\nCommitting to signatures is something I thought about a lot, and has been the topic of much discussion here in the office.  In our antispam token, we baked in essentially segregated witness at launch.  We do it by making two merkle trees, one with the full signed transaction, and one with only the balance information.  Our authority set commits to a particular set of signatures.  To me it seems like a matter of optimizing for the present or the future.\n\n\nThese were the tradeoffs we faced:\n\n-Commiting to signatures means that we have attacks in the present.  If someone malleates a signature, or makes a doublespend (or multiple spends) with the same balance info, then the network has to have intelligence to mitigate that attack, and recover when the authority set decides on one signature.  This causes a little more complexity in the present.\n\n-Not committing to signatures means we have attacks in the future.  If someone spends from a 1 of 2 multisig address, signing with key #1, it would be valid.  Later in the future a signature from key #2 would satisfy validity, and could be spread silently on the P2P network, giving different meaning to the transaction.  Future participants would be unable to detect the deception.  The argument is that future people shouldn't care how the value moved, only that it has a valid authorization.\n\n\n\n\nAnother aspect to the tradeoff is allowing for reduced validation for historical data.\n\nAssume a node wants to trust the consensus mechanism for sufficiently old data, they can download the blocks with signatures, but can skip validating those signatures, just checking the tx hashes.\n\nIf the signatures are not committed to by consensus, malicious peers can supply invalid signatures to these nodes.  While these nodes do not care, they would be unable to later serve up these signatures, since they are invalid.  This hurts the network's ability to propagate blocks when fully validating nodes connect in a world of consensus trusters.\n\nThe consensus trusting class of node would be severely weakened by not having the authority commit to a particular signature.": 2, "That was a really good explanation over on SE. Thanks.\n\nI didn't know separating scriptsigs was the starting design, and the malleability fix was 'just' a 'bonus' feature. A soft fork is, then, not all too different from the hard fork alternative. :)": 2, 'Yes, absolutely. Otherwise you have no way to know whether a block is invalid (a relayer could just have changed the witness data).': 1, "The implementation of it on a new blockchain like Elements is easy, but as a soft fork it's more complicated because now you have a legacy txid and a witness-free txid, and blocks must commit to the legacy txids still. A downside if you use the legacy hash in the merkle tree is that you don't get the pruning of signatures, but I think otherwise this is a hard fork. All the current Bitcoin software is tooled to the legacy txids, and you don't want everyone to have to overhaul their databases and systems to deal with the new form of txid... but maybe they'll have to in the long run.\n\nOutpoints then also need to switch from referencing one type of txid to referencing the new type.\n\nIt looks like sipa tries to work around the merkle tree commitment issue somehow, although the code isn't commented and I'm not sure exactly what it does:\n\nhttps://github.com/sipa/bitcoin/commit/3e92f3be605b6a0b3362c27f3ec2e1791daac09e\n\nI don't know if a hard fork is that much better, because it'll be messy either way.": 2, 'We can always hardfork in a cleaner implementation later.

E.g. alleging that Bitcoin Core is doing nothing and such; when in fact we recently released an update (0.11.1) which makes non-standard _all_ known sources of third party "nuisance" malleability against ordinary transactions; and did so at the cost of forcing all armory and electrum users to upgrade (so I\'m not sure how the people lobbing insults manage to be unaware of it...).

It's cool that this could be rolled out in as a softfork, didn't know about that.)": 6, "Just read more into it. If I understand the soft fork correctly (and it's very possible I don't), it's not (only?) the normalized txids that are being committed to, but the scriptsigs. Scriptsigs in the legacy transaction format would be empty, making for a txid (hash of the full transaction) that is not malleable in the same way it is now. In essence, solving the problem.\n\nThe major downside here is the requirement of having a structure elsewhere that contains the scriptsigs you need to prove a (SW-enabled) transaction is valid. I guess that all transaction (versions) taking advantage of this, would need an OP_TRUE [things] output.\n\nThis means transactions cannot be validated without having access to this structure. Not only would it add complexity to the protocol, it also adds complexity to - as far as I can see - pretty much everything that has intimate knowledge of what a transaction is; wallets/processors/exchanges, explorers, validators, etc. etc.\n\nThe hard fork, on the other hand, changes nothing in the way transactions are validated (scriptsigs remain inside the transaction, legacy outputs remain entirely possible in the same way they are now), they only require prevtxid in an input to be something other than the hash of the full transaction (namely, the transaction without the scriptsigs) - making it a hard fork.\n\nSeems to me the hard fork is a bullet we have to swallow once, and then be done with forever. The soft fork is a bullet we dodge at first, and then shoot ourselves in the foot with forever. So yes, it's messy either way, but longer term - I think we'd be better off with the hard fork.

It's the most/only robust solution, and hard forking it is sane and reasonable.\n\nThe soft fork requires, as far as I can tell, the normalized SW-style txids to be committed in a merkle structure inside the block. (The last transaction, I suppose, for ease of recalculating the merkle root)\n\nThis is terrible complexity to have in the protocol, I reckon, and I think it might just be better to bite the bullet on this one, and schedule its deployment in a hard fork 2 or so years from now.\n\nI'd be interested to hear opinions on why / why not.": 3, 'Why was BIP62 withdrawn?': 0, "(From the lightning mailing list)      \nHi all!               \n\nAs you know, I designed a lightning variant which used only non-experimental, in-planning BIPs[1].  One assumption was BIP62: in particular, that anchor malleability wouldn't be an issue.  This was flawed; BIP62 will never be deployed.            \n\n                      \nThere are several options from here:\n\n* 1) Ignore it.  Malleated txs are non-standard.\n* 2) Add a timeout to the anchor.  Limits the lifetime of the channel, and still means if it does happen you have to wait for the timeout.\n* 3) Propose a reduced BIP62 which (say) only protects P2PKH, for a\n   specific transaction version.\n* 4) Take a leap of faith and assume Segregated Witness fixes all\n   malleability.\n\nI was debating between #1 and #3 for a while, but eventually settled on #4.  Here's why:            \n\n* 1) While still pre-BIP, Pieter Wuille is working on a prototype now (Luke Jr came up with a sanish way of softforking it in).\n* 2) Other parts of the lightning code (in particular, watching bitcoin transactions) become significantly simpler if malleability is  ignored.\n* 3) It's the right thing for Bitcoin; all smart contract systems want this.\n\nThis result is NOP for lightning in the short term; assuming SW is the same as pretending malleability doesn't exist.

So long as you trust the data up to some checkpoint in the chain, or the work done on the chain, you don't need to download those signature scripts and you trust simply that the hash of the signature script data points to valid signature data. In the classic Bitcoin case, in order to validate the hash of a transaction found in the merkle tree, you need to have the serialized data containing everything.\n\nThis is all daemon level, the implementation specifics as of yet I'm not too clear on. This is my current understanding: It apparently allows both classical malleable transactions and a new transaction type that is not malleable. For a transaction to have the signature scripts totally separate, it'd have to reference only inputs that all have a script hash suffixed by OP_TRUE (meaning anyone can spend it to old clients... the top stack item is true so any signature script is valid). Then signature scripts for this transaction are separately included not in the serialized block.\n\nThey only need to be provided separately at the block (daemon) level. You can introduce a new transaction type that includes both the transaction and signature scripts serialized into one buffer, then whoever is mining using an upgraded node can split them up. Or, you could choose a serialization type that submits them separately, it doesn't really matter, the transaction data itself is concrete and immutable whereas the signature data isn't, but the signature data has to validate the given transaction as before.": 2, 'It has nothing to do with data capacity of the network, unfortunately. It just allows you to stick the bits needed to validate transactions off the block, which need to be transmitted with the block.': 2, "Sure. This is more like ELI14, but anyway.\n\nBitcoin transactions consist normally of inputs and outputs. Inputs reference an index in an old transaction (an 'outpoint' pointing to another transaction's output given as [txid, index]) and have a signature script signing for that output. Outputs have a value (number of coins) and another script (often called scriptPk or 'script pubkey') that is a condition for them to be used as an input later in another transaction.\n\nSignature scripts are inherent malleability vectors when an ECDSA signature is used as the condition for spending the referenced scriptPk, because they use a value k (nonce) which is allowed to be set to anything. So, you can make two totally different signatures that are both valid. In Bitcoin, the whole transaction is hashed, and so you get two totally different 'txids', or hashes of the serialized transaction. So, you can have multiple transactions with identical input references and outputs, but different signature scripts. In this example, because the two valid signature scripts are different, the transaction, despite using the same referenced inputs and having identical outputs, has two different versions with two different transaction ids. This is bad if you're a merchant looking for a payment with a specific transaction ID, because with multiple transaction IDs referring to the same basic transaction, you might miss receiving funds if it's not the ID you're looking for. This can also screw up chains of transactions that are reliant on a previous transaction's id: when you reference the 'outpoint' above, you reference the actual txid, which we now know is malleable.\n\nAll 'segregated witness' is is removing the signature scripts from the transaction and providing them separately, and calculating the txid based on the transaction _without_ the signature scripts. So now when you reference a txid, there's only one valid possibility for what it might be because the malleability source (signature scripts) is removed. In the case of the soft fork, it looks like the block commits somewhere to the signature data, with probably a hash of it stored somewhere, and then broadcasts the signature script data separately in a separate message from the block message. New clients get the block message and the signature script message, verify the signature scripts, and then insert the block. Old clients get the block message and still verify it as being valid even without the signature scripts, because in the soft fork case the way it's done makes it look like the outputs are spendable by anyone to the older clients, and so even with empty signature scripts they are validated.": 8, "^^^ xygo\n\nYeah, if you're new to coding in Bitcoin it's important to keep in mind that output scripts, despite being called scriptPk, don't have to have anything to do with public keys, and input scripts, scriptSig, don't have to have anything to do with signatures.

It's also totally irrelevant if a company accepts euros or not, the fact is we can't print ourselves euros just like we can't print bitcoin... the company would have to trade their local currency with someone for bitcoin just like any foreign exchange.\n\n\nRemember bitcoin is agnostic to it's use just like any other money.\n": 1, 'A person running a business will look at euros and see you can\'t lose them in a cryptolocker and then decide "lets use those, bitcoin sounds hella dumb" ': 1, "The most common reason I can think of is someone is launching a new alt coin and they want to get a fair distribution of coins in this new alt coin.  One way to do this is to ask them to send coins to a 'proof of burn' address showing they have destroyed some bitcoin meaning no individual benefited but the person sending the coins takes a provable financial hit (inadvertently increasing the value of bitcoin for every bitcoin owner because there are less now available).\n\n\nThe owner of the new coin probably wouldn't want to accept the bitcoin since they'd be called a scammer if the alt coin dies (as they usually do) yet the alt coin owner now would have real bitcoin to spend.\n\n\nHonestly it's more a thing that can be done so people will find interesting ideas of utilising it.\n\n\nIn time I wouldn't be surprised to see Robin Hood hackers targeting a nefarious organisation like a terrorist group, bank running a scam, environmental damaging companies, etc.. with a locker type virus whereby a demand for coins to be sent to a burn address is requested for restoring their IT resources.  This could be incredibly expensive for the target whilst at the same time not benefiting any specific individual (i.e. there are no coins to ever follow) and the rest of the world who are within the global bitcoin ecosystem will benefit as the supply is now reducing at the same time as demand rising.\n\n": 1}, ('Europe plans crackdown on Bitcoin after Paris attacks', 0): {'OK, but how?': 1, 'This battle will be unavoidable at some point.
