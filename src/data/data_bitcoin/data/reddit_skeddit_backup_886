A bunch of nodes gets hijacked, service still runs, a bunch of nodes goes down, service still runs, a bunch of nodes make a mistake, they get ignored and the service still runs.\n\nBecause Bitcoin timestamps it\'s information, that metadata that constitutes the public key can be used as a password for other verification services, not just as a means of allowing the transfer of coins. Once a public key is in the blockchain, it will stay there forever, and lots of fun things can be done with that public key that you own, one of which is authentication. Colored coins do something similar.\n\nFor authentication, you could potentially embed hardware such that it only functions if it receives a valid pruned version of the blockchain and the person using the device can succesfully decrypt a challenge that the device issues to the user. It could do this by connecting to the internet, and downloading a shortened version of the blockchain that is connected to a public key that is hardecoded into it. It can then seach for the longest chain of transfers linked to that public key and issue an encrypted challenge to the last public key in the chain of transactions, this key would need to be held by the "owner" such that the hardware will only run when this challenge is verified. Additionally if the user wished to transfer authorisation of the device to a new user, it could send the token (bitcoin connected to that address) to the next owner, and then only the next owner could use the device.\n\nThis would be completely decentralised and opens up completley new use cases for Bitcoin\'s potential. There\'s a video of Mike Hearn describing this. It completely revolutionises ownership and authorisation, you would never need to depend on or trust a company, government, or any other thrid party ever, and it would would still be secure.\n\nWhen people say that Bitcoin is more than just a currency, this is the kinds of things they are referring to.\n\n': 1, 'Dis': 1}, ('Apple Pay Question', 2): {'Based on the info they have on the site it looks like you can only spend with retailers/businesses': 1, 'Imagine it like paypal only more shit': 1}, ('My Bitcoin business for e-commerce class.', 5): {"You should probably create some sort of Facebook fan page, or a blog, about this business idea.

You just bought your iPhone 6 and just plugged your credit card to it. Now you go to the coffee shop next door and they don't have an Apple Pay terminal. What now? Well, what else? You pull out your PLASTIC CARD and pay your check.\n\nApple Pay gives no incentive to merchants and its incentive for users is weak at best. It will fail misserably.\n\nThe sad part about it is Google still doesn't get it and they still refuse to adopt bitcoin even though bitcoin would give ALL Android users the ability to use digital payments without having to buy a new phone and without the merchant having to pay any fees.": 2, "So you're defending the innovative capacity of something that's nearly a ponzi scheme?\n\nApple is a joke in the technology world. They don't innovate, they're worse than Microsoft at that. They sell techno-fashion to American zealots who are convinced that this mythical company can do no wrong.": 1, 'Toliro, you would be right about not seeing mass adoption except you are missing a bug and very key piece in your analysis. You say merchants need ApplePay terminals. This is incorrect, they only need NFC Terminals. You might then argue the same point about who will pay for such terminals, since the upgrade to NFC is optional. Why would merchants pay for such a thing? I have an answer for you. NFC Is a required upgrade for all Visa and MasterCard cards by October 2015. Once the cards have NFC merchants will be charged a higher percentage for their transactions that are not done in NFC. When you process half your income through credit cards 2 percent difference matters. More than enough financial incentive for all but the tiniest of merchants to upgrade. Apple timed their entry just perfectly into NFC. It will not fail, it will be transformative.': 1, 'These remind me of the lists why the iPhone would never succeed.': -2, 'I didn\'t even read it.

Both suffer from similar adoption issues and require that merchants upgrade their hardware, software, and personnel training. \n\nOnly Bitcoin promises to offer a return in lower fees and faster use of money, ApplePay does neither of these things. So why would a business want to spend the money and time to implement? Why would the consumer?': 2, "So let's say that I steal someone's NFC card. Can I buy, for example, a $1,000 TV from Best Buy by tapping and not signing?\n\nI've not signed a receipt for less than $100 (unless there's a tip involved) in a long, long time.": 1, "You got it wrong.

The reality is that unified standards in payment systems for the mobile space are the only way to succeed. \n\nThe banks will all get together and agree on a standard for their next generation cards at least in the US. Any NFC payment would be wise to stick to those same protocols or be left in the dust. I still have yet to see any NFC at an ATM either, so banks have a huge amount of pull as to which technology they will adopt and will become the standard. Like I said if you have to carry around the Bank's cards your going to use that for payment.\n\nThe only thing that gets rid of cash in the wallet and still operates like cash, is Bitcoin.

Tapping removes that step.': 1, "Right, but I guess I don't see why I'd rather tap than swipe. I mean, assuming the merchant takes no signature, I don't see an advantage.

To me, all those NFC terminals you see sitting below the drive thru window, next to the cash register, or on gas pumps appear to be doing little more than collecting dust.\n\nAm I crazy, or am I wrong to say that not only do the vast majority of people not use NFC, but the vast majority of people haven't even seen it in use?": 2, '1) If your carrying your debit card with your phone your security is much worse. It would be better to separate the two, carrying a device with massive amounts of personal information and a debit card is a good way to have an empty bank account. \n\nSure, you could say that you would kill the phone, however would you be able to do it before a skilled thief disabled the radio or made a copy of all the data? I would suspect that a very skilled person would be able to disable the radios, crack the phone, and image the contents in a few hours, possibly in as little as one hour depending on transfer speeds and flash size.\n\n2) Choosing merchants based on their processing technologies works for you but most people don\'t choose places this way, because it is inconvenient.\n\n3) If this is true, and likely it will be, it still doesn\'t mean the death of credit card carrying.\n\n4) Credit cards will evolve, and most likely in the form of "chip and pin" or "chip and signature" physical card systems. The fact remains that all credit cards and debit cards thus far, and probably in the near future, are issued by banks in the form of cards, not directly to mobile devices. Therefore one should always expect that the physical card issued by the bank will be more likely to work with all merchants over a clear standard, rather than proprietary mobile systems that don\'t necessarily share the same standards with other mobile systems. If banks choose not to issue cards in favor of virtual downloads, I would think that it absolutely would help adoption, but I don\'t think that is very likely in the next few years.': 0}, ('Barry Silbert on Twitter: "Stripe + bitcoin + Apple Pay = use bitcoin everywhere Apple Pay accepted? https://t.co/ZXk3udTocC https://t.co/avGiFu3TSp"', 39): {'A worthy goal!
