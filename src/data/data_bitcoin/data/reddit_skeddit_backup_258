The setup of Gridcoin combined with BOINC is time consuming and tricky.\nThis bars novices from easy access. In order to provide end users with a plug-n-play solution, PiGrid[5] has developed open-source software\nthat works out of the box and takes care of all related configurations and updates.\nPiGrid can be used on existing hardware or bundled with pre-installed systems.\nA graphical user interface allows choice of research projects via drag-and-drop, monitoring of progress and tracking rewards in Gridcoin.\nThe first generation of PiGrid solutions will be crowdfunded in this Kickstarter: http://pigrid.com/kickstarter\n\nBelow is a list of links for background information.\n- short introduction to Gridcoin: http://uscore.net\n- overview of BOINC: https://boinc.berkeley.edu/trac/wiki/BoincIntro\n- developer board of Gridcoin: https://cryptocointalk.com/forum/464-gridcoin-grc\n- twitter: https://twitter.com/PiGrid_com\n- Gridcoin documentation: http://wiki.gridcoin.us\n\nWe\'d be glad to hear whether you consider to mention PiGrid in any news coverage.\nIn case of specific questions, we are happy to answer your mail to press@pigrid.com.\nThank you for your time!\n\nRegards, PiGrid\n\n____________________\n[1]: http://boinc.berkeley.edu\n[2]: http://gridcoin.us\n[3]: http://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2013/12/03/fascinating-number-bitcoin-mining-uses-15-millions-worth-of-electricity-every-day\n[4]: http://blackcoin.co\n[5]: http://pigrid.com \n\nLatest:\nBesides various updates in our Kickstarter campaign many things will change in the Gridcoin world this month, there are great things coming up:\n\n1.    The new feature Research Age will be introduced enabling unlimited scalability. Thereby, we can support hundreds of thousands of researchers without any loss of payment. Again, it\xe2\x80\x99s not a payment lottery in Gridcoin like it is in Bitcoin, miners/researchers are paid based on their contribution to the BOINC crowd computing network in relation to the whole Gridcoin network.\n\n2.    The second last step in our decreasing reward schedule will take effect on October 20th 2015. This sets a maximum daily coin production of 75000 new GRC. Including the 3% annual interest rate, the inflation rate will be ~9% until the final step. The final step will take effect on November 20th 2015 where the daily coin production reaches fixed 50000 GRC and the annual interest rate will be 1.5%. The global inflation rate will then be ~6% and logarithmically decreasing because of the fixed amount of daily produced Gridcoins (all details can be found in our extensive wiki: http://wiki.gridcoin.us/Proof-of-Research).\n\n3.

For the entire history of Bitcoin, the average block size has been set according to supply and demand in a free-market process unaffected by the block size limit (since it was much greater than the equilibrium block size Q*).

Or is your argument that we\'re not ready for that yet?\n\nAs /u/Peter__R says: users will pay for their demand, so there is no arbitrary protocol limit that can be considered equivalent to an economic limit.\n\nConsider that there are 2 types of Bitcoin transaction:\n\nC or "Care tx" the user pays a fee, expects a money-moving service, and actually cares about prompt confirmation.\n\nD or "Don\'t Care tx" the user pays, but is spamming, advertising, or stress-testing, and doesn\'t care about whether confirmation occurs.\nThis means that there are 3 types of blocks, C, D and a CD mixture. In practice we only see CD blocks, however the ratio C/D in each block is variable, but also immeasurable.\n\nCore Dev and many 1MBers think that there is an unquantifiable amount of D that can be squeezed out (raising the CD ratio) as real-world ecosystem growth continues, by using a hard block limit (L). They also think that this reduces centralisation pressures by keeping blocks smaller than otherwise, even though centralisation pressure has historically been due to users choosing SPV/web wallets and pool mining; not due to the average block size.\n\nSo, although there have been periods of blocks averaging >900KB the likelihood is that these have not yet had a very high percentage of C type tx. The network can hum along with full CD blocks where the ratio is not too high (as seen in stress-tests), but as sustained C approaches L then damage results (affecting PR, price, etc).\n\n> I don\'t know where you got that number from. If confirmation delay at minfee is the key issue, let\'s graph that directly?\n\n75% is a guesstimate based upon the number of small blocks seen during periods when the network is heavily spammed.

Bitcoin will be so popular that only technological limitations can limit it.': 2, "Yes I agree it is but the likes of LukeJr seem to confuse the two.\n\nStill my point is valid miners write transaction to the blockchain and they're being subsidized to do it.\n\nThe subsidiary will be reduced over time and transaction fees will scale to reflect the value transferred over the network.": 4, "Transaction processing costs are between 97-100% subsidized by miners and storage 100% subsidized by nodes.\n\nSo **cheep** is not a choice it's a design features at this point in time, so while block subsidies are high transaction costs are subsidized by users accepting inflation. \n\nCurrent Core developers are trying to maintain a reference code base that is like the 1 ring to rule them all. They want more nodes by reducing transaction volume to create decentralization. \n\nUnderstanding what decentralization means is important. We want to avoid central control. Decentralization does not happen when we get more nodes when 90% of them run a centrally controlled code base. \n\nYou're also framing the choices **secure and irreversible** are not a results of cheap, fast and decentralized yet it's more important as a choice.\n\nSo the options you've proposed even if I picked all 3 would not guarantee Bitcoins success. Those are not choices you need to make the Bitcoin design is not broken they were dealt with when the first implementation was released.  \n\nMy real question is still important, do you think Bitcoin is broken, inefficient or dysfunctional in accommodating an increase in transaction volume on the blockchain?\n\n\n": 2}, ("What happened with the ONEBIT guys?

Another option:\n\nFind an exchange with high volume for both order books.  Might not be easy.  Check the order books ahead of time.  Some exchanges that support both USD and CAD are QuadrigaCX and Kraken.\n\n1. Deposit CAD to QuadrigaCX using EMT (free), Interac (1.5% min $5), bank wire, bank draft, check\n2. Buy BTC with CAD (current ask price is $352 CAD/BTC) plus 0.5% trade fee.\n3. Sell BTC for USD (current bid price is $279 USD/BTC) less 0.5% trade fee.\n4. Withdraw USD to US Bank, VISA (free) Paypal (free), or check ($5)\n\nObviously these btc prices will fluctuate so you will have to do some checking of the order books ahead of time and you will have to check the funding and withdrawal options and fees.  Then see how close you are to the foreign exchange rate that the banks will give you.\n\nBanks will add a foreign exchange fee or has a spread between their buy and sell price.  For example, RBC's will sell $1 CAD to you for $0.803 USD and will buy $1 CAD from you for $0.756 USD.  So it looks like their fee is about 3%.  So you want to get more than $0.756 USD for your $1 CAD when calculating how much you will get from using bitcoin.  Using the buy and sell prices for Quadriga before fees, you would be getting $279/$352 which is $0.79 exchange rate (You will get 79c USD for each $1CAD).  So, add the trade fees, deposit fees, and withdraw fees and see if you are still ahead.  The trade fees are only 1% total and if you go with free EMT to deposit and free Paypal/VISA to withdraw, then I think you will be ahead given this particulate example.  Of course, when the buy and sell prices change on Quadriga, your exchange rate will change.  Having a spreadsheet would be useful to determine if converting CAD to USD using BTC is worth doing at a particular exchange.\n\nEDIT: Forgot to add that some exchanges will also let you convert your CAD into USD without needing to trade BTC in each direction.  QuadrigaCX's exchange rate for example is currently 0.743 so this is not as good as RBC.  The advantage is that you can withdraw the USD to your VISA or Paypal account whereas with RBC you will get cash or pay for a casher's check.\n\n": 2, 'Canadian: Bank account & Coinbase acct.\n\nAmerican: Bank account & Circle acct.\n\nCAD Bank -> Coinbase BTC -> Circle -> USD Bank': 2}, ('bitcoin Core + HD wallet?', 0): {"I've heard through the grape vine that version 0.12 *might* have support for BIP32 which would lay the groundwork for hardware wallet support.

': 1, "Bitcoin's reward schedule is designed such that overtime blockrewards go to 0 and transaction fees will be the only thing left to pay for the security provided by miners. Blocksize currently acts as a supply constraint. And with a supply constraint, people who want to use the blockchain natively will have to pay the high fees to support the miners providing the security. Without a supply constraint, there is no fee pressure. Sure, some miners can refuse to mine low fee transactions. But if it gets mined by someone, everyone will have to pay the cost to validate, propagate, and store those transactions. Being decentralized, everyone has to bear the incremental cost of each additional transaction. And the transaction amount is unrelated to how much it costs the network.\n\nI think the incentives will be messed up in this scenario. Potentially large miners will mine large blocks to squeeze out smaller miners. Smaller miners will stop mining because it becomes unprofitable to mine. Bitcoin will become less decentralized and less secure. We've never had a system like Bitcoin that works so well.

This is good because it\'s very difficult to predict 20 years ahead. We may undershoot or overshoot. It\'s also good in terms of measuring effects on the network\'s decentralization metrics. It\'s finally also good because most protocol development will happen earlier on, i.e. next 5 years, not later 15 years. It is during the time of most development (including things like LN) that block size should be carefully raised, and effects and interactions evaluated.\n\nBased on Tradeblock\'s analysis of expected transaction capacities, a 2-4-8, or 2-3-4-6-8, or 3-6-9, or 3-5-6,7,9 proposal would be sufficient.

When I explain bitcoin to people, the first thing I always say is "Bitcoin is democracy but for money. Its money *by* the people, *for* the people."\n\nThis helps people understand this monetary sovereignty concept from the get go, which is the most fundamentally important part of bitcoin. You are correct in that this is what creates so much more value for bitcoin over permissioned ledgers.\n\nBut I do not think that should be sold as \'forget about permissioned ledgers\' as the elite all-powerful have decided that is the technology they are going to pursue, it *is* going to save them 10\'s if not 100\'s of billions of dollars annually once they start to replace their legacy systems.\n\nOnce they do this, then they can start removing fee\'s from ATM\'s and ridiculous overdraft fee\'s, etc. They can cut corners on their cost of operation and then by doing so be more competitive. Then the sheeple will start hating them less because they dont see the absorption of wealth occurring so directly. Its hard for the average person to understand inflation. \n\nNot only that, but with a interconnected banking infrastructure, it allows them to *print money* easier, as counter-party loans are going to be easier than ever for them. Once they start collecting data en masse and have a interconnected system where they can see more info faster than ever before, then it makes it easier for them to extend credit.\n\nIn short, the banks are struggling to keep their power and are now getting very competitive fearing this new threat and we have no idea how it will play out in the long run.

We the people get to choose the ruleset that is imposed. By a majority vote. Thats exactly what democracy is! Lets look at the definition:\n\n> -a system of government by the whole population or all the eligible members of a state, typically through elected representatives.  \n> -a state governed by a democracy.  \n> -control of an organization or group by the majority of its members.\n\nThe network is the government, and the rules are decided by the eligible members of state/whole population. You can choose to operate a node (vote) or mine (vote) on the rules you wish to enforce, or choose to *not* vote/participate. The majority of population that decides on the rulesets in this case determine the rules enforced by government.\n\nThe abstract here is that there are economic incentives, which then makes it a free market discussion as well. yet there are not economic incentives to run a node, and yet I run one, thereby casting my vote. Seems to me that it is a democratic version of money that is controlled by free market principals.

However without a blockchain you cannot have Bitcoin for example.

Read more on this technology in his whitepaper here - it clearly demonstrates innovation in technology, in what he/she dubs the "blockchain": https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf\n\nSo whether we use blockchains, or "ledgers" as they are traditionally called, for bitcoin or etherium or Ripple or whatever... It\'s how we APPLY the technology to CREATE something like bitcoin. Bitcoin is only one example of the application of blockchain technology, and is not the technology itself - hence the need for the name "blockchain"; bitcoin and blockchains are two different entities and cannot be compared, as one is based on the other.\n\nTo me, a blockchain in it\'s simplest form is a way of keeping track of and proving ownership of a digital token/asset. That token or asset can be anything you want, whether its a house, vehicle, stock, or bitcoin for that matter. Blockchain technology finally allows us to be able to do this in an extremely efficient, secure, and decentralized manner.
