I mean the orderly update from 0.7 to **0.8.1** in August 2013, which forced the old 0.7 off the network as these old nodes did not support transactions with too many inputs. This is in accordance with Peter Todd\'s definition of a hard fork, namely that "a previously disallowed behaviour is allowed", thereby forcing old nodes off the network. Still, Peter Todd argues that the 0.8.1 update was not a hard fork due to the following technicality: the 0.7 nodes still had a slight chance of processing the new blocks as the error appeared non-deterministically. So the old nodes were not all forced off the network immediately, but only over time. To say that this does not qualify as a hard fork is extremely nit-picky, if not wrong.

A much more economical way to do this is to simply attach an already synced blockchain data disk to a cheaper VM (like A1 which is half the price).
