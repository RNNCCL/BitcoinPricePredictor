It has the right degree of complexity (near zero) I can absorb well.': 1, 'I don\'t know if you\'re looking for technical explanations for various implementations, or if you just want to *understand* multisigs better.\n\nIf you want to understand them generally, I think I can help.\n\nWhether or not you understand how Bitcoin works, you can generally grasp the idea that it\'s a ledger, and when you send money to somebody, you\'re really sending out to the network the statement "I\'d like to edit the ledger to show I transfered money" and you digitally sign that statement so everybody knows it\'s really you.\n\nBut that statement isn\'t actually a statement, it\'s a script -- a miniture program that runs.  Every bitcoin transaction is actually a mini program.\n\nNormal Bitcoin addresses are actually programs that execute and the code says "check this digital signature to make sure that it is valid for this transaction, then make sure the key associated with that signature is actually the correct key for this address, and if those two things are true, edit the ledger showing this money being unassigned from this key and assigned over to this key, which will require those same checks if it wants to spend the money.  And if any of those conditions I\'ve outlined evaluate as being false, then don\'t edit the ledger."\n\nSo the mini program runs, and checks the signature and makes sure it\'s the right address, and makes sure the amounts are all valid and so forth, and then if everything checks out, your transaction will be mined.\n\nMultisig addresses are actually just a different set of programming instructions in the script that runs.  They say "Make sure m number of signatures from the set of these n keys sign this transaction, and if all the signatures are valid and there\'s enough of them, and everything else checks out, then update the ledger."\n\nThat set of instructions is called a redeem **script**.  It\'s an actual script that runs.  And it\'s why multisig addresses are a small subset of what is called P2SH addresses.  a.k.a "pay to script hash" addresses.  Because whereas regular addresses are hashes of public keys, P2SH addresses are hashes of the redeem script.  (And so in addition to other conditions, they always also have the clause that you must hash the entire script and make sure the hash matches the address, so you know you\'re running the correct script associated with the correct address.)\n\nThis scripting feature -- the fact that the money movements are actually programs that run -- means there\'s a lot of extra neat things you can do (but which have yet to be fully utilized).  Those other programming things you can do are what all the excitement about so-called "Bitcoin 2.0" is about.  It\'s about realizing the potential for this neat new way of doing things via programming.  One of the lesser used features that is currently available is called "nLockTime".  Basically, in addition to any other instructions you put in a transaction, you can also optionally add the instruction "and only update the ledger if the date is later than X".\n\nThat feature in combination with multisig addresses can be used right now for safe and secure escrowed transactions where you can provably lock up money and show the other person that you can\'t spend it, but still withhold paying it to him until he fulfills his end of the bargain.  What you do is you make a multisig address using your key, his key, and an escrow agents key, and set it so two of those three keys are required to spend the money.\n\nThen you send the money to that multisig address.  So now he knows that the money is no longer yours-- you can\'t spend it unless he or the escrow agent agree.\n\nThen what you do is you create a transaction to spend the multisig money and pay his single address, but you also add a locktime requirement on the transaction before you sign it.  Then you sign the transaction (which isn\'t finished yet, because remember, two signatures are required for it), and send it to him.  Now he knows that he\'ll have the money after the time passes, because after that time, he can sign the transaction and it will be complete and it can then be mined.  But he can\'t get at the money BEFORE the time has elapsed.  So if in the mean time he screws you over, you and the escrow agent can conspire to make and sign a new transaction that double-spends his transaction, and without a time requirement, so this new one will get mined before his.  But if he deals honestly, he just has to wait out the timer and then he gets his money.\n\nThat\'s obviously a very complicated annoying process.  But the idea is that it\'s technologically possible to do, and to do without any central intermediary running things.  Web services can be built to make the process arbitrarily easy for the user, as long as it\'s *possible* in the first place.\n\nCoinbase for example has a multisignature vault that they can prove means they can\'t access your money without your consent, but for which the user experience is merely "enter your vault password in order to spend your money".  Behind the scenes is complex, but the user experience is pretty easy.\n\nAnyway, I hope you have a better idea of what multisigs are and how they and Bitcoin work.': 18}, ('Offline wallet completing a Bitcoin payment via NFC and Bluetooth', 128): {"This is the kind of thing that is so obviously a good idea that you can't help but ask yourself why you didn't think of and implement it first.

Bitcoin does fit the definition of a trustless system (as it eliminates the need for trusted third parties, a phenomenon mentioned repeatedly in the whitepaper), given that the assumptions about the majority of the network being honest or honest-but-curious hold.  So it is considered a trustless system, even by the [OECD](http://www.oecd.org/daf/fin/financial-markets/The-Bitcoin-Question-2014.pdf).\n\n\nSo tl;dr it is trustless, but there are heavy computational and economic assumptions involved that are nonobvious.': 1, 'Hive implemented it as well, but when they moved to their cordova-based cross-platform app they kind of un-implemented it again. )-:': 3, 'The merchant has internet access.

I'm not sure how that's relevant here.  The whitepaper is primarily technical and I haven't mentioned any technical challenges or details in any of my posts.\n\n> There is zero comparative advantage to settling fiat transactions on the bitcoin network.\n\n\nI disagree.  Bitcoin has major advantages as a fiat payment network - it's worldwide, instant, low overhead, allows for unbanked participants in a mixed fiat/BTC economy, and eliminates the need for a remittance industry or currency conversion overseas.  It's also quite convenient to spend in retail, requiring as this video shows only a mobile phone for its use.  \n\n\nI never argued against Bitcoin as a store of value - see my other comment and note that they are complementary and actually synergistic applications.  Unless you expect Bitcoin to depose fiat entirely and atomically, we will need a solid Bitcoin-fiat payment infrastructure for those who are still interacting with fiat economies while wanting to use Bitcoin, and nothing in the whitepaper or anywhere else precludes such a system.  Even if you think Bitcoin will eventually replace all fiat (which I do not), there will still be a transition period where such services are inevitable.\n\n\n> Centralized payment rails are instant and convenient. \n\n\nAgain I disagree.  They are extremely high-overhead by comparison, non-inclusive, slow, and complex.  They don't allow for frictionless micropayments or new smart spending modes like smart contracts, and often require you to trust them with sensitive financial information.  What centralized payment infrastructure allows you to potentially pay anybody in the world without being affected by physical location, the legitimacy of the receiver (from huge businesses to the unbanked), or the final fiat (or not) currency of choice?  With ten minute confirmations, pseudonymyty, and no potential for fraud?  I think these are all major competitive advantages.\n\n\nAnyway, my post was not an endorsement of what I believe should be the only future of Bitcoin.  Just one low-effort way Bitcoin can chip away at fiat payment solutions today with infrastructure that already exists and a business model / value proposition for consumers that makes sense.  And I'm sure as I said in my original comment that the big players are already looking into this, so it will happen regardless.": 1, "Looks cool!

Bitcoiners need to internalize the immensely larger potential that bitcoin offers as a store of value as compared to bitcoin as a payment processor.

These are both still present in the system you propose.  You need centralized agencies to convert between bitcoin and fiat.  There\'s just as much friction with coinbase having to change money on either end of the transaction than there is with PayPal.  \n\nRegarding the whitepaper, I quote:  "Commerce on the Internet has come to **rely almost exclusively on financial institutions serving as trusted third parties to process electronic payments**. While the system works well enough for most transactions, it still suffers from the inherent weaknesses of the trust based model."\n\nI didn\'t see Satoshi say, "therefore, we need to move the trusted third parties to the onramps and offramps of bitcoin to solve this problem."': 2, "There is much less need for trust in a third party when it comes to electronic cash.  There is only very localized risk of identity theft, information leaks, fraud, payment reversals, etc.\n\n\nAnd the fact that Satoshi introduced a model that is trustless does not mean he wanted to eliminate all trusted models.  When you have an economy comprised of both you need interfaces between the two.  Before there was no possibility of a trustless model, and now there is.  As you seem to understand that's what makes Bitcoin revolutionary.  \n\nIt's that same trustless model that provides the advantages I stated over the legacy fiat system, as it allows you to deal either directly with the transaction recipient or with only a single institution in the chain rather than dozens.  And if you're dealing with an institution the institution gets the guarantees provided by the trustless model, passing them on to you (eg - with Coinbase/Blockchain/GreenAddress not allowing for transaction reversals that put your balance in the red or being able to discriminate against who you send money to like PayPal or Visa do currently).\n\n\nSo once again, Satoshi's introduction of a trustless infrastructure is not to be confused with a statement that all trusted systems should be eliminated.  Some people prefer to trust a third party, and I think that will forever be human nature.  There's no reason we can't use a trustless model to bring advantages to these people that were not previously possible while still allowing for trustless operation for all who care about their money.": 0, "My first IRL bitcoin purchase almost went wrong because I couldn't get signal inside the shop. It also took ages for me to check the transaction had gone through and ended up asking to check out the transaction ID on blockchain.info via their laptop.": 1, "Yes he does.

This is what I've always seen as the future for retail BTC payments.  Only one more step is left and that's a wallet which allows users to spend on the BTC network without telling them it's BTC.  \n\n\nThink PayPal with Bitcoin output, so no need to maintain a BTC balance, just scan the code and approve the USD amount and payment is completed over Bitcoin network.  Then you can shop all over the world with your fiat/BTC app, with merchants all accepting BTC and converting to fiat on their end.  And with the same app you could pay anyone over the internet who accepts Bitcoin in USD.  Offline transactions could be done by maintaining a USD balance and relatively recent exchange rate, providing an older USD estimate to the user and syncing with the server to debit the real USD amount as soon as connectivity is achieved.\n\n\nCircle is close but not quite there yet.  You still have to hold a BTC balance / think in BTC / see the word BTC, and you're still exposed to volatility.  These things are unpalatable for the average consumer, and probably always will be.  The average consumer doesn't want to manage their own retirement accounts, nevermind their daily spending money.  They want it all to be managed for them, and that's why they love the legacy system.  They don't have to think and the government makes sure there isn't any reason for them to by guaranteeing they'll cover all the mistakes.  While we should give them the option to deal directly with BTC as a commodity/asset (which is totally empowering and inclusive to people who the legacy banking system doesn't work for or the growing minority who prefers to avoid them), there's no reason not to build services they can use in their daily lives.\n\n\nPayPal could really dominate this space with all of the infrastructure they have for fiat payments already, they just have to decide they want to add BTC as an output option for any account with instant USD to BTC conversion.  The advantage being completely secure payments to any merchant on the globe, whether they sell VPS's out of Bulgaria or hot dogs in NYC or even your unbanked uncle in Zambia, with no setup cost or bank accounts required for any of the participants and ~10 minute confirmation times (zeroconf being accepted in retail).  I wouldn't be surprised if they partner with BitPay to do the reverse of what BitPay currently does and do an instant USD/Bitcoin exchange - the infrastructure is already there on BitPay's side.\n\n\nIn fact with competition from usurpers like SnapCash, Square and Venmo promising frictionless payments, now is the time for PayPal to step up and develop a risk appetite, and they would be silly not to pursue a very simple and easy avenue that has the potential to embed them in every retail, online, and international USD transaction at the consumer level.\n\n\nObviously eventually we want to close the loop and have B2B payments, etc. in BTC but the above is almost implemented and if done right would make BTC the best payment solution the world has ever seen.  At the very least, we'd start seeing new modes of Internet-enabled payment (from smart contracts to tipping etc.), the need for currency conversion would become relevant only when transacting cash (as you approve an amount in your currency of choice), and the remittance market would become a thing of the past as it integrates into the wider global payment ecosystem.": 12, 'Great insights.

Only 4% were admitted in the last session, and most had plans related to bitcoin. \n\nLast week, Boost announced that its next session will be all-Bitcoin, with about 20 to 30 companies in the group.\n\nThe elder Draper believes he is getting in on the ground floor.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am looking at this as a great long-term opportunity,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tim Draper, who plans to bid for more bitcoin at an auction on Thursday. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know exactly where the bottom is, but we are probably close to it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nFew argue with that sentiment at Boost, where Adam Draper showed up one day clad in bright orange sneakers and jeans with a black T-shirt emblazoned with the Boost logo. Mr. Draper, who wants to fund 100 bitcoin companies within three years, said he chooses applicants to join his \xe2\x80\x9ctribe\xe2\x80\x9d based on their vision and how much they can use the money.\n\nThe younger Mr. Draper, who recently raised more than $6 million from investors to fund Boost, benefits if the companies strike bitcoin gold. Boost invests $10,000 to $20,000 for a 6% stake in each company selected for the boot camp.\n\nThe participants even bunk together at a dormlike hotel, owned by Tim Draper, across the street from the Boost offices.\n\nCatheryne Nicholson was one of the ones who made the cut. One recent Tuesday, the former naval officer and mother of two joined other Boost entrepreneurs preparing for a presentation in front of 100 potential investors.\n\nHer company, called BlockCypher, hopes to find a niche essentially providing the picks and shovels for developers trying to build bitcoin applications.

Gox, which he said was difficult to use in addition to losing money.\n\nThe months of preparation culminated in late October on \xe2\x80\x9cDemo Day,\xe2\x80\x9d as the group boarded a bus for a 20-minute ride to meet potential investors at the Menlo Circus Country Club in Atherton, Calif.\n\nOne by one, the executives took the stage to make their four-minute pitch, most wearing brightly colored T-shirts with company names emblazoned on the chest.

Standard messages are the default type and provide a standard level of security. Secret messages are meant for highly confidential conversations and provide an extreme level of security and privacy. App users can switch between these two flavors for every chat conversation. Making a conversation secret is very easy, and only requires tapping on the "lock" icon inside the app.\nInstant messages are encrypted on two levels. The first level of encryption is relevant for both standard and secret messages. For both types, all communications between the Gems mobile app and the Gems instant messaging cloud server are encrypted - this is also referred to as client-server encryption. Communications between the two is performed over SSL in a secure tunnel (HTTPS) with 256-bit keys. This prevents third-parties from listening in. This also prevents man-in-the-middle attacks and makes sure the Gems app only communicates with the real server and not anyone impersonating it.\nThe second level of encryption is only relevant for secret messages. On top of the client-server encryption, secret messages also have client-client encryption. Every Gems app generates a unique random pair of 4096-bit public/private keys upon installation. The public key is propagated within the network, but the private key never leaves the device. The public/private pair is unique to a device. If the user transfers his Gems account to a new device, a new pair is created. The key pair is also expired and refreshed periodically to enhance security.\nWhen user A sends a secret message to user B, it\'s encrypted using RSA 4096 with user B\'s public key. Once the message arrives to user B\'s device, it\'s decrypted with B\'s private key. Decryption can only take place on user B\'s device because only this device has access to the correct private key.\nThe benefit of client-client encryption is that it provides a zero trust environment. The encrypted message cannot even be decrypted by the Gems server infrastructure. This means that even if the Gems servers have been compromised and hacked into, secret messages are still 100% private and can only be decrypted by their rightful recipient.\nThe drawback of secret messages is that they cannot appear in push notifications. Since push notifications are encrypted by Apple\'s/Google\'s infrastructure, they don\'t conform to zero trust policy.

Every Gems username is synonymous with a gems wallet, making payments to contacts as easy as clicking a button in the app.\n\n(5) Anonymous users must hold a minimum of gems in order to be fully trusted by the network. One of the problems with any social network is abuse and fraud. This problem is easier to solve if users are validated against some physical identity such as a phone number. Since privacy and anonymity are becoming increasingly important, trusting users through identification is becoming increasingly difficult. Some delicate actions within the network will be reserved for trusted users, for example participating in airdrops, appearing in the user directory, sending friend requests, etc. Owning gems (and not necessarily spending them) is a quick and easy way for anonymous users to become trusted and enjoy privileged actions.\n\n(6) As the network grows and new features are added, some of those will require payment to sustain. Gems will always exist as a payment option for any value added features available in the app. Additionally, as new p2p reward models are created, new opt-in features will become available enabling sharing economy type activities, crowdfunding, and more. Since this is the first time the users will control the core value of the social network it is too early to predict what new novel ideas will come into existence\n': 3, "Yea your number is your alias to your username and wallet, so i don't think you even need a btc address at all you just send btc like sending a message, this is aimed to get the common untechy person to the ecosystem, app is supporting gems and bitcoin, gems is created because it's off chain and wouldn't need transaction fees": 5, 'AIRDROP: Daily airdrop of gems - Every day, ~27,400 gems are air dropped from the Exodus Address. The ecosystem automatically distributes these gems between users according to their relative network contribution. Contribution is measured by the number of active daily users which were introduced by you to the network so far.\n\nThe contribution score for a user is calculated according to two complementary factors: (1) The total number of new, active users that the user invited during the time period. This calculation is directly related to the active-user counts (total of active users per original inviter). (2) The total number of gems that the user currently holds in his account. This means that users with large amount of gems will be rewarded more generously than users without gems.\n\nPRESALE PERKS: Since daily airdrop rewards users who introduce other users, who is rewarded for those who come without a special invitation? Uninvited users will be attributed to random Presale buyers (this is a MAJOR bonus in our opinion). In addition, air drop share is multiplied by total gems owned. The more gems you own, the more gems you make - an advantage to those who accumulate gems first.': 1, "GEMS are tokens, akin to dividend paying stocks. This is why you can't use bitcoin and why CounterParty exists. You don't need gems to use the messaging app. In fact simply using the app will earn you GEMS. So why would anyone buy GEMS? The hope is people will use the app and value in the network will grow. Advertisers will buy GEMS to push ads to users. Users agreeing to see ads will earn more GEMS. the most popular social networks on the Internet make money by selling your identity to advertisers. And you don't get a cent of it. With GEMS you own your information and completely control whether you are exposed to ads. If you agree to it you are paid for it. GEMS are traded on the distributed CounterParty exchange and will be traded on CP enabled exchanges like bter and poloniex. Again, bare minimum GEMS is a free to use encrypted messaging app that gives you the ability to earn GEMS which are easily exchangeable into BTC. Whether or not the network gains enough traction to attract advertisers remains to be seen.

That part really doesn't need much explanation.  Later they may or may not support this social network as it gains or loses users (I'm guessing few will actually use it) but that doesn't really matter because the original objective will have been met.  Unless they are continuing to mine (remember there is a limited supply) it will cost them money to maintain over time.  So really it is in their best interest to run it for a while and then kill it at a later date.": 1, 'Oh great centralized solutions, so this is absolutely with out a doubt terrible. This could be done in a decentralized way without needing any additional blockchain or centralized DB.': -2, 'Gems are settled offline through the Gems internal hosted wallet. This is a hybrid semi centralized database system meant for smaller balances and to allow for speed, security and zero transaction fees. Gems are able to be withdrawn to any external counterparty wallet which is processed using a secure counterparty gateway server.': 2, 'Gems is a pyramid shaped investment vehicle.  You can buy gems and when you refer people to gems you get a cut of the gems.': 4, 'Gems is a Social Messenger integrated with next generation bitcoin technology. Gems offers a WhatsApp style mobile experience with fully encrypted and private messaging, and a built in wallet.\n\nAdditionally Gems introduces an innovative reward mechanism which benefits its users rather than charging them. Anyone using the Gems application receives Gems tokens for inviting their friends, utilizing the network, and helping to build the ecosystem. Gems tokens serve as the in-app currency which, for example, are paid directly to the users by advertisers.\n\nIt is our belief that users bring value to a social network and they should be rewarded accordingly. We specifically designed Gems to give users full control over their data and the opportunity to profit from being a part of our success.\n\nGems also helps introduce cryptocurrency to the masses in a profitable, fun and easy way to understand.

Then the left over is sent to a change address.  It shows your change addresses so you can see what is going on a bit better, and probably to help you handle privacy better.\n\nHere are some tips.  If you want to have more control over your addresses, then you can right click on an address then click "send from".  This allows you to select which address you want to send from instead of electrum choosing for you.  Also if you have used an address in the past, and don\'t want to reuse it for privacy reasons, then right click the address, then click freeze.  I believe this will freeze up the address so electrum won\'t use it as change anymore.  Also it may prevent spending inputs from that address until you unfreeze.\n\nAlso as far as receiving an e-mail, I prefer not to because of privacy concerns, but I can see why someone might want to receive an e-mail for convenience or business purposes.  There are probably some services that offer this just by searching the blockchain, but I believe you can still use blockchain.info for this.  Here is how you do it I think:\n\nGo to blockchain.info and make a new wallet or log into your old.  Then click the import/export button.  It will give you a warning, but go ahead and just click through it anyways.  Then add any addresses you want an e-mail for into the "watch only" field.  Don\'t mess with the private key field though.  I believe this will allow you to then get e-mails using the watch-only addresses.

But when you use an electrum seed it is called a Hierarchical Deterministic (HD) wallet.  Basically it can create millions(probably more, not sure the exact amount but its A LOT) of addresses all from the same seed.  Basically all of the addresses are created instantaneously when you first create the seed.  That is why you only need one backup. \n\nSo yeah you can just record one or more of the addresses, along with the seed.  However if looking for long-term storage its best to do this in a complete offline environment. It is called "cold storage". One of the easiest and most common ways to do it is to create a live Ubuntu USB or CD. [Here](http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/create-a-usb-stick-on-windows)  is a tutorial on how to create a bootable Ubuntu USB from Windows. Make sure NOT to set up any persistence volume when creating it.\n\nUbuntu is a free very user-friendly Linux distribution, don\'t be too intimidated.  Once you set up your USB, you just plug it in and boot the computer, and it will boot into the USB drive instead of the hard drive.  You may have to change the boot priority options in the BIOS menu first so it will boot into the USB drive instead of hard drive.  Edit:  Also once booted make sure to just click "try ubuntu", and not install ubuntu.  You just want to try it out on the USB stick and not install onto your hard drive.\n\nThe reason for using the bootable USB is that from my understanding all data exists in memory and is essentially wiped when you shut down Ubuntu.  Once booted, connect your internet in Ubuntu.  Then just go to the software center on the left sidebar, and search electrum, and then download it and install it.  Then once electrum is installed it is important to then DISCONNECT the internet, and NEVER turn it on again until you shut down ubuntu.  Now click to launch electrum and record your 12 word seed and public addresses.  Then shut down Ubuntu, and you have created a pretty secure cold-storage wallet for long term storage in my opinion.\n\nTo restore the wallet, just download/install electrum and launch it, but choose the restore wallet option and type in your seed.  Then voila you have a live hot wallet again.': 3, 'Here\'s how the address display algorithm works?\n\nDoes it have a history? (Send or receive transactions)\n\nDoes it have a balance?\n\nIf Yes, then No: hide under "used" tab.\n\nIf Yes, then Yes: show receive tab or change tab\n\nIf No, then No: show under receive tab or change tab. Then lower the gap value by one for the respective tab.\n\nThen once the gap value hits 0, it stops showing addresses.\n\nDefault gap value is 5 for receiving addresses and 3 for change... So you\'ll always see 3 fresh change addresses and 5 fresh receive addresses at all times. ': 2, 'Thanks for the tip! \n\nYes the addresses are created really in a chain.  So I believe electrum shows the first several addresses in the chain.  However I believe you can receive coins from any address deeper down the chain as well. I believe electrum will scan the blockchain and if it finds any transactions associated with your seed, then it will show them in your wallet.\n\nEdit:  I think there is also something called a master public key, which can be used to determine all of your addresses.': 1, 'That support team is not worth shit.
