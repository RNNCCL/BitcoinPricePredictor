Because of travel times, we established a network of clearing-houses (12 Federal Reserve district banks, and half a dozen privately run ones).  Banks still settle up with each other daily for all their customer's transactions in both directions.  The ones that owe a net outgoing balance post funds to the clearing house.  Then the ones due a net incoming balance get paid by the clearing house.  At the end of the daily process, the clearing house holds no funds, and everyone is happy.\n\nElectronic clearing can go faster, but some banks have not yet updated their systems, and still have lots of customers that write paper checks and only accept such checks (My electric utility only takes cash and checks at their office, for example, and charges a fee for online payments).  So they can't yet go to hourly clearing without breaking the system.": 1, 'In fairness thats a US bank story, the gap is not anywhere near as wide in Europe with fast bank transfers.

A bunch of nerds with large mining servers aren't really any match to these goons.\n\nFor this to happen they would need money (which they have), time, and resources (which no one does). They would have to either order or crank out an enormous amount of ASICs, and someone would be bound to notice. It would also take them at least a year to build that stock up from scratch, and governments just aren't that focused or disciplined.\n\nNow, let's say they succeed, and manage to get a 51% pool going which starts to mine blocks without any transactions, effectively grinding all transactions to a halt:\n\nThis would be noticed quickly, and a patch will come out (with code likely already mostly developed) that will make blocks invalid unless they contain a certain amount of high priority transactions. This means that either their own blocks will be completely ignored, cutting them out completely, or they will be forced to accept other's transactions, making bitcoin work as normal (though under their threat).\n\nOr we can have the top pools form a sort of a trusted cartel, where the pools only accept blocks from the list of mining pools they trust (those being the public ones we have now), and nodes add a quick patch to likewise only accept blocks only from those pools. Again, the attacker is completely cut out from the system. Downside is that this will temporarily centralize all the pools into a single cartel (though the pools are still independent), but the users will no doubt change their nodes back to normal as soon as the threat is gone.\n\nBut, let's say the very worse case scenario happened. The attackers are completely relentless, and there is absolutely no way for the other miners to overtake them. At this point, all competing mining pools are considered dead for all practical purposes. Since people don't want to lose their money, the solution is once again fairly trivial: swap the hashing algorithm for something like scrypt that can run on graphics cards (before the days of ASIC). The mining pool ASICs were already dead and useless at that point, and now the government ones are as well, while Bitcoin picks up from the last block that mattered, and keeps on going. Sure it will harm it considerably and will shake its trust, but it won't kill it, and will likely only make it even more resilient to these types of attacks, meanwhile whoever just spent hundreds of billions to attack bitcoin, and failed, is up before congress having to answer for wasting billions in wasted tax payer dollars.\n\nThere are other counter-attack scenarios that will make the attacker's investments useless besides just these, and it's the knowledge that we know about these that keeps anyone from actually seriously trying to attack bitcoin.": 1, 'Yes, the situation is much better if you want to transfer money within the European Union.

Everyone\'s wallet in this system only displays values as fractions of dollars, not pennies. \n\nLet\'s imagine you have 2.53 dollars in your wallet. That\'s actually 253 pennies - because the system does not know what a dollar is. Humans have simply come up with the abstraction that 100 pennies equals a dollar, but the system that records all of the transactions does so in pennies.\n\nNow let\'s say a bunch of people lots their money or threw it away because they didn\'t think this radical system of 1000 monetary units would take off and  about 500 pennies are taken out of circulation. The remaining 500 pennies are certainly not enough to run a proper economy, so people decide to divide them so more units are available and simply "split" everyone\'s holdings. \n\nSo they change the system so that all wallets now display a thousandth decimal in the client and your balance shows $2.530 dollars.

You take that borrowed money, turn your life around, it was a big part in making you the successful person you are today, a neuroscientist making millions a year. **If** the debt you owed to this person obeyed a *mathematically* predictable equation (AKA an agreed upon interest), then no problem you pay back 200$ + interest. But if there is no mathematical model, and only **speculation** as to how much that initial 200$ contributed to your now successful career, that annoying guy you had no choice in going to could every year, as you become more successful say you owe him more.  After all his investment was "an enormous risk on a super volatile and unknown asset". He was your first/earliest and strongest reason for success, and in many ways your staunchest supporter-- he took the risk on you. I imagine most people would say that\'s kinda bullshit. Yeah he gave you 200$, but you did all the work becoming a neuroscientist, he didn\'t do anything. \n\nThis is the situation I speak of here in bitcoin now: we\'re going to reward those who took 5$ first/earliest and then expect everyone to owe them more and more as everyone else becomes more and more successful. (The way they keep you owing them is by never moving that debt, they just keep it and hold) If you dont personally see a problem with that, then I guess we can\'t have much of a debate. But I kinda feel somewhere deep down that if that\'s the way things turn out then we didnt really fix anything, we just replaced problems with pretty much identical problems in different packaging. Additionally, if we want to poke at the longevity of a fiat currency because of its inherent systemic problems, then since we\'re not all that different, we could say the lifespan of bitcoin will be just as (if not more) short lived: because the same motives to leave the system and seek a more fair and worthwhile system will just reemerge in a couple of generations....\n\n\n': 1, '> You could say that the founding fathers and the first bankers and captains of industry in the new born US took an "enormous risk on a super volatile and unknown asset". Therefore the system should **always forever be skewed to reward them** or whomever they choose to succeed them enormously disproportionately. They created it all. "Of course the reward should go to those who are in first/earliest, they\'re the networks strongest reason for success and its staunchest supporters." **Isn\'t this what we already have?** Isn\'t this what we already think is unfair about the US and other countries and their respective fiat currencies?\n\nThese are the key misunderstandings you have.\n\nBitcoin:\n\n* Initially rewards early adopters\n* Perpetually rewards those who support the network (miners, and anyone who wants to can start being a miner)\n\nUSD:\n\n* Initially rewarded early adopters\n* Perpetually rewards the US Fed\n\nBitcoin is skewed to reward early adopters, but not "always forever", just once.\n\nThe initial reward to early adopters is great, but as I said above they can only spend that reward once.  They don\'t get a constant stream of new Bitcoins just cos they bought some at $5.\n\nThis is fundamentally different to the USD, where the Fed and established banks get a constant flow of new currency, just for being in control of the system.\n\nSo no, it\'s not what we already have.\n\n> (The way they keep you owing them is by never moving that debt, they just keep it and hold) \n\nI already discussed this...\n\n"If people buy and never spend it and die with it, who cares?\n\nIf they bought early and have a lot of money now, they are being fairly rewarded for supporting a revolutionary technology that everyone else thinks/thought was stupid, pointless, valueless or never going to survive.

No, you didn\'t take "thousands of dollars worth of risk", because you only put in $5, but you are being rewarded with thousands of dollars for taking a $5 risk that was very important to a world changing technology at a seedling stage, not to mention never selling that $5 even after it increased magnitudes in price, crashed multiple times and had everyone around you telling you you were an idiot constantly.\n\nMaybe you think that a few thousand dollars is a really disproportionate reward, but if Bitcoin turns out to deliver about 10% of what it potentially could, I doubt there would have been any reward to early adopters that seems unreasonable in the big picture.\n\nNote that lottery ticket winners pay $5 for a ticket, and don\'t take "millions of dollars of risk", but I\'d say the outcome is more than fair if it works out for them, the odds obviously aren\'t in their favour.  Bitcoin is the same, even up until now the odds are probably not in your favour to bet on Bitcoin, but if you do it anyway because you want to see some change made in the world (this is where the lottery ticket analogy breaks down) then you should be rewarded.': 0, 'This whole article was a great source of comedy!\n\n>The amount of the new currency created would depend on demand.\n\nHuh?

Money can only be issued by following the rules of the protocol, which work the same for everyone.\n\nI specifically said "equal", and not "fair", because fairness is a slippery concept that is impossible to agree upon.  Obviously the world is not fair, some people start with more resources than others and Bitcoin cannot change that.  Some people heard about Bitcoin before others and there is no way around that either, just as some people heard about Apple stock before others and may or may not have chosen to buy some.  Satoshi announced Bitcoin on a public mailing list read by people who were interested in the idea of cryptocurrency.  Most people didn\'t care.  The people who did care took a risk and that risk turned out to be profitable.\n\nNone of that has anything to do with the equality I\'m talking about.

You\'ve become a non-participant, and a non-producer to the coin economy. Yet the effort and production of everyone in the smaller space where coin is moving increases the price, *and your* wealth. So in essence we are rewarding the most those who purposefully dont do anything. And maybe its even worse, because we are rewarding most those that did nothing the longest/first. So as new generations come in and want to be within the coin economy, first, how are they to know what coin is actually available? What coin is actually lost, or  just being held on to by people not wanting to actually do anything with it. You wouldnt know, and you\'d have to speculate. Which again, seems perfectly fine for an investment. But maybe not for a currency.... and secondly, are we to expect that miners would be a fairer distribution or issuance of money to new participants? I dont know. \n\n\nMaybe what we really want is to peg 1 coin to the value of 1 acre of land, or something more imaginative or something like that. Maybe we actually do need to have a fluid number of coins in existence as the number of people in existence is itself fluid and changes. Maybe there needs to be a way to determine when coin is lost, versus just sitting around doing nothing. I dont really know. But something seems a bit short sighted about one of the main-pillars in the way we\'ve set up alot of coins.... If the wealthiest of people are those who came first and arent really doing the most of anything, what did we change from the fiat world we supposedly wanted to get away from? What I\'m trying to say is I\'m not so sure about this **treats all participants equally** statement right now. Does it even need to be that way? I\'d like to see it that way. But not sure it is that way now, or will be that way with the current set up... thoughts?  I guess it all depends on what you want your end goal to be: do you just want to make profit for you and screw everyone else in time that comes after you? Or do you want something that really does treat everyone fairly and equally, and honors effort and production, even for those that have yet to be born?\n\n\nThat aspect aside, technology wise, the bitcoin platform is far superior and will continue to get better. There\'s really no reason a government couldnt do it I guess... give each citizen a standard fair miner.

Recursively because it is itself a prediction of the future, and because as you make it information that determines price, it becomes part of the history of price influence and so it applies to itself.\n\nIt follows that a statment that recursively references and applies to itself, which modifies the nature of the thing it purports to make a statement about and which is therefore internally contradictionary is not a very good utterance. It is in fact, an empty phrase. It\'s devoid of any concrete meaning.\n\nNevertheless, this phrase is uttered around these parts many a time, and so it follows that to properly categorize this statement, having proven that it\'s void of meaning, it must be something else than a statement. Fortunately just such a category for self-perpetuating void statement exists, they\'re called a "meme". They\'re something that people infect themselves with and which lodges in their brain, and they become carriers which then spread it further, often without thinking or checking what they\'re actually helping to spread.\n\nCongratulations on having made it down here and it was my pleasure to give you an education in philosophy.\n\n': 2, 'I like it, thanks for sharing.

The idea falls apart even under the most generous assumptions.\n\nMeanwhile, under the far more realistic assumption that people are and have been acquiring bitcoins primarily as an investment in their future promise (including e-commerce adoption) and perhaps as a deniable way to preserve some of their capital, it also makes no sense for people to say, "I was targeting an investment portfolio of 50% bitcoins and 50% dollars, but Dell is accepting BTC and I gotta have that new Alienware computer so now I\'m gonna target 40% bitcoins and 60% dollars." Rather, even if this person decided to mess up their ratio a little bit by spending bitcoins and not dollars this time, they likely won\'t continue to do so. Assuming their investment outlook hasn\'t changed, they will either buy the bitcoins back or at least spend them less and less - especially if the Bitcoin price falls as that would skew their portfolio ratio of bitcoin to dollars even further from where they want it. (Remember that we\'re here assuming that the person is primarily into Bitcoin for investment purposes.)\n\nSo why do people all these primarily-investors spend bitcoins at all? Why not just sell them if their bitcoin-fiat ratio grows too large? Because selling on exchange can be difficult, expensive, time-consuming, and risky. *If* there happens to be something they were going to buy with fiat money anyway *and* they feel their portfolio is overweight in bitcoins, it becomes a no-brainer to spend the coins. \n\nThus for the investors, merchant adoption becomes an alternative more efficient and cheaper way of selling/profit-taking in certain situations. As merchant adoption increases we should see less and less selling on exchange and more and more direct purchases. Nevertheless, the lightening of bitcoin holdings was going to happen anyway, as part of the inevitable price gyrations in the face of people\'s portfolio targeting.': 4, "You haven't shown a correlation yet though.

Really.  \n\nMoney laundering is a crime separate and distinct from the underlying transaction.  It is the process of trying to make "dirty" money look like it is clean by disguising its source through a series of certain specified types of transaction.  \n\nConsult any lawyer you want.  Selling drugs for Pokemon cards is a crime (drug dealing), but it\'s not money laundering.  Under your theory, if I sell drugs for something, anything really, even cash, I can be charged with TWO crimes--drug dealing AND money laundering.  That\'s silly, and it\'s wrong.  \n\nThe question is whether I commit a SEPARATE crime, called "money laundering", if and when I later transfer those cards, or the cash, to someone else.  And the answer depends upon who I transfer it to, and what my intent was in doing so.  If I transfer the cards, or the cash, to another drug dealer to obtain more supply, I have committed yet another crime, but I\'ve not yet engaged in money laundering.  If I transfer it to Burger King for a burger, then I\'ve not committed any other crime, and I\'ve not laundered any money.  \n\nIf however, if I run the cash through a "front" business (like a restaurant or a car wash or some other business in which cash is frequently earned) for purpose of making the money look like it was the proceeds of a legitimate business activity (my restaurant or car wash) rather than ill gotten gains, and especially if I deposit it into the bank account of that front business so as to introduce it into the financial system, then I have committed the separate crime of money laundering.\n\nMoney laundering is a process consisting of stages.  For a simple explanation for non-laywers like you, see this:  http://www.bankrate.com/brm/news/bank/20060628c1.asp\n\nHaving said that, your analogy to Pokemon cards is a good one.  Bitcoin is no more "money" than Pokemon cards are.  Selling drugs for Pokemon cards, and then later selling or trading those Pokemon cards for cash or other valuable goods or services is NOT money laundering, UNLESS:\n\n1)  Pokemon cards are "funds"--that is money--which they are NOT; and\n2)  The purpose of the subsequent transaction was to disguise the illegal source of those funds.  \n\nIf the above were not true, then every illegal activity involving the use of "funds" would constitute, in an of itself, a second crime called "money laundering".  In other words, if you are right and I\'m wrong, then the money laundering statutes are simply a way to charge anyone with two crimes for the same act.

Entire companies are currently being founded for the explicit purpose of exploiting Bitcoin\'s non-financial uses.\n\nI\'m not saying that any of this would have changed the judge\'s opinion since she seems hell bent on a predetermined outcome, but these facts sure would have made her decision far more difficult and would have forced her to find some ulterior rationale for her ruling.

That why he had so many of them!  There is no evidence in the record that I know of that he attempted to launder the bitcoins.  He simply sat on them.\n\nAnd lastly, non lawyer, when you are charged with a crime in the United States, YOU don\'t have to "prove to a court" anything.

You could go so far as to sell that illegal property for cash on the street and not be guilty of money laundering!  Now what you do with the cash after that is a different story:  If you attempt to disguise its origin through the process of placement, layering and integration, THEN you are guilty of money laundering.
