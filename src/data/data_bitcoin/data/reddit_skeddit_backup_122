Imagine five guys driving down the road and arguing over where to stop for lunch.  They\'re approaching an intersection.  If they turn left, there\'s a restaurant a few miles down that way that two people in the car want to go to.  If they turn right, there\'s another restaurant a few miles that way that\'s also championed by two people.  Finally, if they keep going straight there\'s a third restaurant that the last guy sitting way in the back wants to go to.  He says, "Well, sadly, it looks like we\'re not going to be able to achieve \'overwhelming consensus\' on a \'hard turn\' to the left or the right. And we obviously don\'t want to make a \'contentious turn\' and risk a \'catastrophic consensus failure.\' I mean, if we all tried to go to different restaurants we might get lost or murdered or something. So... best just to stay on the current road and go where I want go."  The driver puts on his blinker and says, "shut up, I\'m driving the car to the Mexican place on the left.  If anybody wants to walk somewhere else, I\'ll pull over right now and let them out." Of course, nobody does.  The guy in the driver seat in this analogy is the "economic majority," and the car is the network effect (it\'s in everyone\'s best interest to stay in the car even if the destination isn\'t their first choice).  "Staying in the car" (abiding by the same set of compatible rules / agreeing on an identical ledger history) is how Bitcoin "consensus" actually works.  Thus, it\'s incredibly misguided to say that we need "overwhelming" (or God-forbid, unanimous) "consensus" *before* effecting a hard fork.  A hard fork *will produce* "overwhelming consensus."  Having said that, there does appear to be a strong ["hard fork conservatism"](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/40tje8/proposal_for_fixing_rbitcoin_moderation_policy/cyx3p89) among miners. (They\'re only willing to attempt to trigger a hard fork as part of a large supermajority.)  I think *some* level of "hard fork conservatism" is probably healthy, but I think the current level is probably excessive and based on many people\'s failure to appreciate [how strong the incentives toward convergence on a single ledger are](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/41vqbo/bitcoindev_pieter_wuillle_its_ridiculous_to/cz68n3i).

Every single change to a production system had to be signed off by at least eight people and scheduled at least four days in advance.  And if you ended up not getting everything exactly right in telling the admins what to do (like literally they just sat at the keyboard and did everything verbatim as written in the change order) then it was a fucking nightmare to convince them to do something slightly different or it would have to wait till next week.  But it was never next week, because you could never have some systems down when other systems were being worked on, so this might delay release for weeks.  And often times this was for simple shit like patching their systems.  But then along came another crew who decided they were going to start patching when they felt the systems needed patching, so  they would just randomly shut down everything at 3am unless you told them days before hand not to fucking do that, so we had to have a fucking team just scheduling patching or, better yet, just fucking rebooting systems because there was an edict that shit had to be rebooted if it had been running for so many days or more.\n\nFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK\n\nI mean, yes I realize it was a bank.

The idea that 2MB blocks will somehow dramatically increase centralization is nonsense.  Every person I\'ve talked to who runs a full node says it will make no difference to them.  Let\'s get real.  Bitcoin *is* centralized, in its development and mining.  It\'s most decentralized in propagation (~5500 nodes).  If that count falls to 4000 that\'s the least of our problems.  The single best way to get more decentralization is to get more adoption, which will likely lead to more people running full nodes.  Honestly, what difference does 4000 vs 5500 full nodes make?  And is that difference worth hamstringing bitcoin\'s transaction capabilities and discouraging new adopters?\n\nMany new accounts (like mine) exist because people who criticize core devs get banned on this forum.\n\nLastly, here\'s how "contentious" hard forks work in practice.  70%+ of the community voices their agreement for innovation.  A hard fork is rolled out that specifically takes effect when 70%+ of nodes have upgraded to it, so everyone has *lots* of advance warning.  Then bam: everyone can transparently see that the fork has supermajority support, so almost everyone gets on board.  This is what all the big bitcoin companies and miners have said they will do: they will simply accept whatever the dominant fork is, even if it isn\'t their first choice.
