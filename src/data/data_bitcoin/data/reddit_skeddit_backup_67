No. Most likely a relational database doesn't have, by itself, properties you want, so you need to do something.\n\nPerhaps you can implement triggers and stored procedures which will automatically timestamp data you add to the database using hash trees.

There originally was a single blockchain. But suddenly Mallory maliciously creates a second blockchain with some data altered. How to know which one is the original blockchain?\n\nThere is no way of telling by just looking at the blockchains. So the blockchain cannot be an immutable ledger if it stands on its own.\n\nWith PoW, it can at least be made harder to recreate the blockchain from scratch, however as you point out, that won't really work either.\n": 1, 'It\'s disingenuous to call it "the technology behind Bitcoin". Guardtime have been using a blockchain-like approach since 2007, two years before Bitcoin was released.\n\nMoreover, essentially it\'s just Merkle trees and hash chains arranged into some interested pattern. Merkle trees were patented in **1979**. It\'s by no means new.\n\nSo, basically, a company which uses old, well-known cryptographic constructs in a slightly innovative way (I\'ve read KSI paper so I know it\'s not so groundbreaking) decided to capitalize on Bitcoin/blockchain hype because Bitcoin happens to use same cryptographic constructs. (Satoshi didn\'t invent any new cryptographic constructs, he just figured out how to use economic incentives to secure a decentralized system.)\n\nThe only new thing here is that enterprises now start to think that they might use crypto protocols a bit more complex than the basic PKI.': 7, "> If not, anyone can just recreate the entire blockchain from block 1 with altered data in an instant and claim that it is the original data.

If they do so, you can prove them wrong by demonstrating your copy of the blockchain. You cannot prove that your version is right, but you can prove that they violated their promise to manage only a single copy of a blockchain.\n\nif that company owes you something, you have the right to demand it. It works the same way as with digital signatures. E.g. suppose Alice gives Bob a signed check for $100. Then she makes another check for $50 and claims that Bob's check isn't original. Would that work? Of course, no, whatever Alice does, it doesn't invalidate the check Bob already has.\n\nAs for PoW, the value it adds is that a system normally converges towards consensus when economic incentives are aligned properly. It certainly makes history-rewriting harder. But if you take some dead SHA256D coin and use a modern miner on it, you can easily rewrite history starting from the genesis block.": 2, 'bitcoin blockchain?': 2, 'Thank you for your answer.

I may add that a blockchain without PoW is not immutable. If the goal is to create an immutable ledger or information store, then there must be also a PoW be involved.

There is no way to proof them wrong.': 1, "> But suddenly Mallory maliciously creates a second blockchain with some data altered. How to know which one is the original blockchain?\n\nA second blockchain cannot just appear out of blue. It can be a result of a security breach (leaked private keys) or a collusion among entities which were supposed to safeguard it.\n\nAt that point system cannot continue to work as is. However, it shouldn't be a problem for humans to figure out which of copies is the right one.\n\n> So the blockchain cannot be an immutable ledger if it stands on its own.\n\nI don't think that 'immutable' is the right term here. Every blockchain is immutable in the sense that every block hash rigidly defines a list of transactions none of which can be modified without altering said hash. So it should be trivial to detect corruption or tampering.\n\nThe property you have in mind is better described as tamper-proof or tamper-resistant. Blockchains are tamper-proof under certain assumptions.\n\nFor PoW that assumption is that economic incentives make creation of altered blockchains unprofitable, and that miners act in their best interest.\n\nFor proof-of-authority federated blockchain the assumption is that no more than N out of M authority nodes are vulnerable or collude.\n\nFor proof-of-stake the assumption is that it is in the best interested of stakeholders to maintain the blockchain in a healthy state AND it's possible to bootstrap a node in a safe manner.\n\n> With PoW, it can at least be made harder to recreate the blockchain from scratch\n\nWould you say that hijacking node of 10 largest banks is easier than hijacking 10 largest Bitcoin mining pools?\n\nI don't these cases are comparable, they just have different assumptions.\n\nAnd it's a matter of context. Would you say that Bitcoin which was at one point controlled by a single mining pool is inherently 'immutable' unlike some hypothetical ledger which is protected by 1000 independent universities around the world?": 1, 'So you are saying a blockchain would be more efficient for this use case? It would be faster and/or use less computing resources?': 1, "It depends. If the Blockchain is UTXO based then you need to reconstruct the current index first. If it's account based, search should not be a problem.": 1, 'This makes perfect sense. Thanks. ': 2, 'First of all, security isn\'t binary. A cryptosystem can be secure against _particular_ attacks under certain assumptions.\n\nFor example, Bitcoin security guarantee is that as long as the network is controlled by honest miners all users which will be able to connect to it will achieve probabilistic consensus over the state of the blockchain.\n\nBut if you run a Bitcoin wallet on a trojan-infested machine, obviously it won\'t be secure.\n\nSo back to Guardtime, first of all, their main offer is a timestamping server. You can use it to implement tamper-proof logging, audit trail, digital signature schemes etc.\n\nThey offer a tamper-proof server hardware, and additionally you can real time monitoring to detect discrepancies.\n\nNothing is 100% unbreakable, but this thing is probably good enough to make hacking it practically unfeasible.\n\nIs it better than Bitcoin? It depends on assumptions you make. On the one hand, Bitcoin doesn\'t depend on a particular piece of hardware, it\'s massively decentralized, so "hacking" Bitcoin is impractical. But, on the other hand, we know that in principle it might be enough to control largest miners/pools to rewrite chain history.\n\nBut if timestamping is what you need, you can actually use a combination of a trusted server with a Bitcoin blockchain.': 2, 'Computer Science question here...

A client with non-interoperaable rules such as a 1mb+ client and a 1mbOnly client, that gains the majority of the network hash power could cause one chain to die unless it moves to a new POW but that isn't a requirement, it's a decision by the losing team to keep their side alive in case they were really right and the two chains can coexist and likely specialize, one may be a high fee settlement layer and the other could be closer to a p2p electronic cash.\n\n\nWhat else could cause this need? A new, cheap and easy, way to do SHA-256 hashes would be like the new age of ASICs but unless they were owned by bad actors why would the network split?\n\nSo let's say jsut age, SHA is old and QCs are real, the SHA-256 must be changed, a fork will be made that upgrades the sysem but that would hace a huge amount of prep and plan time (if it ever got agreed upon, it's more likely a group will split that outgrows the stagnet chain over time).\n\n\nIf we assume there has to be a switch and NOW, then what? We have to pick a new *secure* algorith which is hard to do under pressure and ot the happyness of many.\n\nIf you want to be prepared in this regard, then find a new POW that is secure, and find hardware that can perform it.

In a non-emergency, the algorithm would be published 6-24 months in advance due to the hardfork rollout delay, so ASICs might already exist by the time it activates.\n\nIt might be the case that botnets would not have all that much GPU power because people who get infected with botnet malware probably have not-so-great GPUs. I don't know.\n\nEven if botnets would dominate, I'm not sure that this is a major problem. Botnet operators can't be trusted, but at least botnets are pretty distributed. It's probably unlikely that there would often be individual botnet operators with more than 20% of the network. When a miner has a small percentage of the network, they tend to gain more from cooperating than attacking the network.\n\nOne interesting idea I heard was that even-numbered blocks could use one PoW, and odd blocks could use another: one ASIC-friendly PoW which would have a few big mining farms like today, and one ASIC-resistant PoW which would probably have a lot of botnets. This would encourage mining decentralization. However, many experts suspect that it's not actually possible to build a PoW algorithm that ASICs will never be able to compute far faster/cheaper than consumer hardware.": 1, 'Probably the new PoW would be mined mainly on GPUs for the first 3-9 months, until new ASICs came into production. So I guess if you wanted to build a "militia", you\'d want a lot of GPUs.\n\nRandom thought: Some older ASICs supported both sha256d and a secret manufacturer-specific version of sha256d with slight modifications, and could be configured to switch to this alt PoW. The idea behind this was that if mining attacks were coming mainly from one manufacturer, the PoW could be changed to be `(new_PoW OR manufacturer_1\'s_alt_PoW OR manufacturer_2\'s_alt_PoW OR ...)`, but excluding the abusive manufacturer\'s alt PoW. Then the network would still retain a lot of hashrate immediately after the PoW change. Unfortunately, I think that the alt PoW project was abandoned a year or two ago due to it being too time-consuming and difficult to convince manufacturers to do it, so I don\'t think that any modern hardware supports an alt PoW. But if it\'s necessary to change PoW, it might make sense to look into supporting the old alt PoWs. Then people who have obsolete mining hardware laying around might be able to get some use out of it again, the Bitcoin network will get an immediate boost in hashrate after the PoW change, and this hashrate will be from miners who are probably fairly likely to be trustworthy.

Each JM transaction has "coinjoin outputs" and "change outputs"; it\'s only the former that are all equal. The change values are distinct for each counterparty; that\'s a tradeoff - it means people with different utxo sizes can do joins, and allows the fact that the change outputs can be linked with the inputs. The privacy gain comes from the fact that the equal coinjoin outputs completely obscure the linkage of those outputs.

An obvious solution is to make every tx input and output the same amount somehow in CJ.  \nThe straightforward solution is to get a wallet what has a huge liquidity and make every transaction CJ transaction with the same amount. Obviously this is not something that can be done in practice.  \n  \nSo that's when JM came and it said. Let's get a few people and call them makers. They will just sit around with their coins and wait for other people, called takers to come and for a small fee buy their liquidity. So when a taker comes and wants to send 3btc to an other address with equal amount CJ tx he asks a few makers for a fee to join their tx together with him and use the same amount.  \n  \nThis is why I think JM and CT is not complementary.  \n/u/belcher_ Is my reasoning right?\n  \n": 2, 'I mean if 100 ppl join their tx together (probably cant there must be a limit for this) Then the attacker has 1% chance to guess the right combination.

It saves space the more inputs you have in the transaction (even in one person\'s normal transactions).\n\nCJ is combining multiple people\'s transactions to try to obfuscate whose coins go where. Users of CJ get a bit more privacy but it takes a bit of effort to do and therefore hardly anyone does it and therefore the privacy benefit is relatively small anyway. \n\nSuccessful CJ requires enough potential partners to join with and if subsequent transactions are not done with CJ they can undo the privacy effect of the CJ.\n\nBut now combine these two: if you do CJ+AS your transaction becomes cheaper! Now there\'s an incentive for everyone to do CJ as much as possible, even for the lazy people who say "I have nothing to hide anyway". So there should be many more potential CJ partners.\n\nAdd to that that AS actually makes finding CJ partners easier because the communication beforehand is simpler (no need for complex back and forth: just give the partially signed transaction to the next person and let them add their own).\n\nEventually when blockchain analysts try to trace coins, hopefully they\'ll get stuck trying to deobfuscate many subsequent CJ steps.

All those people using OP_RETURN to spam pointless crap against the will of the network into the blockchain are also destroying bitcoins. A *lot* of coins have been provably destroyed.
