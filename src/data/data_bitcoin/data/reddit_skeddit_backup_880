[Anonymity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lx9zgZCMqXE#t=466) The narrator seems to imply TOR is enough to anonymize your Bitcoin usage, but that\'s not true. If you purchased your Bitcoins on an exchange, mined your Bitcoins from an IP address linkable to you, or purchased goods shipped to you, you\'ve potentially leaked your information in each case, and TOR does not help you there (except in the second case, mining on TOR would prevent that situation). As he goes on to say, analysis of transactions could use any of those three methods to reveal more about your bitcoins and transactions. [Wiki page describing Anonymity Issues](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Anonymity)\n2. [De-anonymizing Transactions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lx9zgZCMqXE#t=486) Though not yet common in the "wild" yet, CoinJoin allows users to trustlessly issue transactions which appear as though they were issued by a single person, but are not. [Some discussion](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=139581.0) resulting in 51,000+ BTC which would appear to be owned by a single person, according to that naive analysis.\n3. [An attacker needs much more than 50% of the network hash rate to solve several blocks in a row](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lx9zgZCMqXE#t=1006). This is technically correct, if you have a 50% chance of finding the next block before the rest of the network, you have a 25% chance of finding two in a row before the rest of the network, and 12.5% chance of 3, etc. But that\'s not how an intelligent attacker would attack the network, since the network will switch to the longest chain, all the attacker has to do is ignore the rest of the networks blocks, and only use their own chain. An attacker controlling >50% of the network\'s hash rate is guaranteed to *eventually* out pace the rest of the network.\n4. I didn\'t particularly like what he says about proof-of-work proving that the entire network\'s hash rate was brought to bear, but I suppose it\'s fine for the intended depth of the video.\n5.

Firstly, Bitcoin is seamlessly convertible to every major currency on earth. So, if you can buy USD with Bitcoin (or euro, yen, rubles, pesos, oz of gold/silver, etc) then that in turn can buy anything else literally in the world.\n\nBitcoin is however accepted a little more directly (and thus conveniently) at Overstock, NewEgg, Dell, MemoryDealers (and thus Bitcoinstore), TigerDirect, Expedia, CheapAir, Namecheap, BigFish Games, 1-800 flowers, REEDS Jewelers, Foodler, DISH Network, the Chicago Sun-Times, with potentially hundreds more Braintree merchants including AirBNB and Uber (who have already voiced support) coming online in the next few months and tens of thousands of more services from every VPN company in the world to half the hosting and digital delivery services in the world, and small bars and shops and online stores and bed and breakfasts and such peppered about the globe, but I\'m trying to stick to listing the big names you\'d be more likely to either recognize or directly patronize without having to know a thing about you.\n\nAlternately you can use Bitcoin to rapidly (as in, at point of sale rapidly) purchase gift cards with 3% points back at either [Gyft](http://www.gyft.com/buy-gift-cards/category/allretailers/) or [eGifter](https://www.egifter.com/giftcards/) to shop at Amazon, Target, CVS Pharmacy, Whole Foods, Burger King, Red Robin, Chilis, Applebees, Sears, JC Penny, K-Mart, Home Depot, Lowes, Barnes N Noble, both Fandango and Regal Cinemas, Best Buy, The Gap, American Airlines, Hyatt Hotels & Resorts, Carnival Cruise Lines, Staples, Toys R Us, Domino\'s Pizza, Papa Johns,  IHOP, I .. look, just I got tired of copying them all down so I put the merchant list in links at the start of this paragraph, okay?\n\nAnd this may be more limited than the 50 year old credit card network but it is far less limited than credit card adoption was 5 years into their run.

A person can then use M-Pesa to buy bitcoins (on BitX.co.ke) or a person can convert bitcoins to M-Pesa (on either BitPesa.co, or BitX.co.ke).\n\nSo there's little reason for a merchant to not accept Bitcoin since those funds can be nearly instantly converted to fiat (for a 3% fee, w/ BitPesa.co).   There just is the chicken/egg problem where few people have bitcoins, and using Bitcoin requires a smartphone and mobile data -- something that much of the population can't afford.\n\nSo without M-Pesa, bitcoin would be even further away for most Kenyans.  At least today those with M-Pesa (which is nearly everybody) can receive funds originating from Bitcoin without even knowing what Bitcoin is.   This is great for remittance payments and those that export.\n\nToday there are certain types of commerce that wouldn't occur without M-Pesa.  For example, a motorcycle delivery driver (boda boda) might be vulnerable carrying around large amounts of cash (as many payments occur on delivery).  With M-Pesa the driver can either accept M-Pesa or promptly deposit the cash with an agent after accepting the cash payment.   These types of businesses might consider expanding their business to other countries but would find no equivalent to M-Pesa in many of these countries.   So basically M-Pesa has created a breeding ground for businesses that rely on person-to-person mobile payments.

But there's no reason those 'other merits' *have* to be tied to specifically Bitcoin.**\n\n**Basic points:**\n\nBitcoin *itself* as a specific digital currency and a specific application of that technology only has great value in-so-far as the mining and transaction networks are large and robust. Right now, it's the biggest and most robust, but its still tiny compared to the financial services field as a whole. The VC invested into it is only about $100 mil., and it would only cost about $200 mil. to buy the computing power to launch a successful 51% attack. For comparison, Chase Bank earned $6 Bil, or $6,000 Mil. in the past 3 months.\n\nOther payment systems could co-opt the technology. BTC's ecosystem and user base have to be extensive enough that this is prevented in order to declare it a true winner.  The potential for different products that use the same technologies to capture the value of the technology without using BTC is very real.\n\nFor example, Apple could make Apple Coin, roll it out beautifully, use very similar technology, and have it partially backed by Apple until it takes off. They could invest in it a lot such that the mining network is developed, Apple Coin becomes adopted widely as a currency, and the public has confidence in it aside from Apple's original backing. They could stop backing it at that point, and it could become as decentralized as BTC. With Apple Coin's huge market share and well developed ecosystem, BTC would fall to the wayside.\n\nAnother example would be if several huge players got behind LTC or Dogecoin. BTC could plummet even while the technology behind it is widely adopted.\n\n**Where I'm coming from:**\n\nI don't want other players to co-opt this field! I want it to be like the internet: made by nerds who value democracy and autonomy, and allowed to grow free long enough that governments and corporations can't restrict its freedom of use without serious blowback.\n\nI am pointing out how I come out on these issues because we can't take Bitcoin for granted; if we want to see Bitcoin succeed, we have to use it as much as possible. If you're buying something from Amazon, buy it with a giftcard purchased in bitcoins from eGifter or Gyft.\n\nSend bitcoins to friends and family who are tech savvy as gifts, tip on other subreddits significant enough amounts of bitcoin that the user goes and collect it. As a community of early adopters who care about the product, it's up to /us/ to help it succeed. \n\n**We can't say its success is inevitable because its inherently technologically superior, or has such a huge head start that it will definitely be the one that wins. I think that's just not true.**": 1, "Nicely put. It's also like saying I will be more bullish on the electric car movement once more people start using them. ": 8, '\nI guess the idea in this thread is something like: "When transaction volume increases Bitcoin will be a success" is a silly statement.  \n\nInvestors in btc, ecosystem developers, philosophers, etc think Bitcoin will and must succeed on other merits.  \n\nBitcoin is the blockchain with an open ledger, open protocol and an ecosystem.  Closed arbitrary ledger currencies have large transaction volume.

I think it should be about 5x higher if it is being used in place of a significant portion of the existing payment processing system.\n\nThe data suggests that a fairly small number of people suspect Bitcoin will be widely adopted. Ie, that current prices are driven by speculation, not adoption. Bitcoin has the potential to capture a significant portion of the global financial payments system. If it captured 10% of that roughly $350 bil. industry it could be worth 5x what it is today. Bitcoin will probably also increase the total value of the industry since it is a significant technological improvement, and replace payment processing processes that are too small to be traded on major markets. It also is likely to capture (or be adopted by) a portion of the banking industry, and other financial services industry. \n\nBut right now, the transaction volume and price are consistent with "Bitcoin is like beanie babies--people buy them because they think they will soon be valuable."  The potential is there for Bitcoin to be widely used enough of a currency that it\'s closer to a shiny metal than a beanie baby, but the tipping point for a lot of investors, economists and business people will be when people are using it to buy and sell on a daily basis, not as a novelty or as a place to park money that they think will appreciate.\n': 0, 'Or "I\'ll think bitcoin is going to be successful when it is successful."\n\nThat\'s hardly a difficult bet to make. I\'ll believe the sun is going to come up tomorrow when the sun comes up tomorrow. Meaningless tautologies are meaningless.': 2, 'Bitcoin\'s value is primarily as a transaction medium. The technology that allows it to be so successful in that regard is available for use completely independent of the actual currency. If Bitcoin isn\'t adopted widely as a transaction medium, its value won\'t be realized. In that case the value of an individual bitcoin, won\'t really increase.\n\nIn your edit, "blockchain" may be more the more apt analogy to "internet" than Bitcoin is.\n\nThe US government, for example, could issue digital crypto-currency redeemable for dollars, or gold. If Bitcoin /itself/ is not widely used for transactions, it seems likely that the very efficient technology it is based on will be co-opted by existing institutions, and the currency will fade to memory.\n\nIt sounds like Thiel is saying that (regardless of the technology) he wouldn\'t put his money on bitcoin the product until it\'s used widely as a currency.\n\nLook at the transactions over time compared to the price over time.

How could you tell when something was truly random?  And was there a way to measure *randomness*?  (*Hint to kids:  this will not help you get laid.*)\n\n\nWhen a teacher designs a test, the distribution of answers *A* through *E*  doesn\'t seem random either.  (At least that\'s my sense of it from when I was in secondary school;  teachers might properly randomize the answers today.)   It seemed back then, that answers *A* through *C* occurred more commonly, than *D* or *E*.  Furthermore, *lengths* of any one particular answer (such as 5 *C*s in a row), seemed less common than they should have otherwise occurred, even on 100-question tests.  I also felt a slight prejudice represented on the tests towards answer *E* when in the specific context of *E* representing:  "All of the above."

If the test\'s answers were truly distributed randomly, then drawing a line through the *A* column, for example, should be sufficient to provide a series of random answers, netting the student about a 1 in 5 score (on an *A* through *E* test).\n\n\nWhen the test\'s answers are not distributed randomly, and a student furthermore chooses answers in non-random way, the resulting effect interests me.  Does it create more or less *randomness*?  Would there be more of a chance at acquiring a 1 in 5 score or less so?  (Assuming full *randomness* nets you a ~1 in 5 score.)  And would doing so repeatedly increase entropy?  Or just shift the distribution from a finer level of granularity to a more coarse granularity, without necessarily affecting the degree of *randomness*?\n\n\nAfter all these years, I still don\xe2\x80\x99t have a clue about *randomness*.

Consequently, all PoW coins compete over these resources. Put differently, PoW currencies all compete over which will actually get the miners to mine them. \n\nBecause miners will collectively all mine the most lucrative coin, the mining power behind that coin eventually dwarfs the little mining power left for the competing coins. This leaves these smaller coins extremely vulnerable, and indeed you have a powerful mining monolith that is capable of effortlessly wiping out any competing coins from existence should it choose to. The mining community behind the top coin is so powerful that a tiny fraction of the community is all that is required to 51% attack most other coins around.  Even if the monolithic mining community switches to mine another coin for beneficent reasons, the massive increase in hashing power utterly annihilates that coins profitability overnight, causing the miners to exit, leaving the coin\'s difficulty rate sky high making it no longer worthwhile for the small time miners who had previously sustained it.  \n\nAll of this is just to say that proof of work technology inevitably results in just a few winners, perhaps just one or two. You can\'t just fork Bitcoin and expect to compete with it, because -- even putting aside network effect issues -- the massive mining power behind it precludes any competition from startup coins. Right now it is conceivable that a powerful institution or company or bank could start their own coin with a massive mining operation behind it to try to dethrone Bitcoin, but if there is another price bubble, the mining arms race will become so insane that no single company, and eventually no single government, will be able to catch up.\n\nWhat this means is that for companies like IBM to create their own block chain -- one that is secure -- they cannot use proof of work, they have to use one of the software based block chain algorithms, like proof of stake (i.e the algorithm used by Nxt) or delegated proof of stake (which  bitshares x innovated). And that is likely what many businesses will do. However, the difficulty with these software based block chains is that they are, as you suggested, infinitely forkable, so their value is far less entrenched since someone can always come around and just make a new one. Their value relies entirely on other factors, whereas with Proof of Work, the value is - at least in part - derived from the exclusionary nature of the mining itself. A proof of stake coin might become tremendously valuable because the organization it represents shares in becomes successful, but its value won\'t be entrenched like a PoW coin\'s will be, since the value of a proof of work coin will be in part due to the fact that it lacks competition. \n\nThis is likely why proof of work coins -- namely, Bitcoin -- will most likely end up being the "gold standard" in the space. The question is to what extent will PoW coins be 2.0 friendly. We already see PoS coins exploding with 2.0 possibilities, and projects like IBMs "internet of things" seems to be catching the vibe of those 2.0 possibilities. Perhaps 2.0 will be mostly the domain of software block chains. However, it is still conceivable that projects like IBM\'s could eventually opt to build on top of PoW block chains, rather than trying to create their own. Particularly for projects in which the success of the project does not translate into increased value of the underlying asset or token. In those cases, projects will need to work on top of an existence block chain and will be forced to forgo creating their own block chain, as block chain technology requires value in the underlying asset to work. \n\nFurthermore, it is conceivable that a secondary PoW coin, merged mined with the primary PoW coin, may serve as a kind of open block chain available for other projects to use. That is, a merged mined coin could be more flexible in its ability to take the kinds of risks associated with 2.0 innovations, while enjoying the security of the primary coin. In Bitcoin\'s case, that satellite coin is Namecoin. Namecoin is a sha-256 coin that is currently merged mined with Bitcoin and was actually born out of the desire to use the block chain for things beyond the money app. If Namecoin became the focus of such 2.0 technologies such as Counterparty, rather than Bitcoin which suffers from tremendous conservativism, you might see a situation where many projects in the future that utilize block chain technology simply build on top of the Bitcoin/Namecoin system, in the same way most companies choose to use the internet rather than create their own internet from scratch. \n\nPut simply, proof of work may very well result in one block chain (or a couple merged mined block chains) to rule them all, which everyone will use when they require a public block chain because their purpose is non-financial. Proof of stake block chains, on the other hand, will prevail in terms of providing closed financial ecosystems, such as decentralized banks or decentralized companies, and will be equally central to this revolution. Projects where the value of the project is connected to the value of the token can implicitly build their own software based block chain and the value of those tokens will be guaranteed by the value of the project. Relying on PoW block chains would be detrimental to this kind of operation. PoS is just as important an innovation as PoW, but for different reasons. I don\'t see one competing with the other, but actually they will complement each other. \n\nMy 2 bits.

WalMart didn't want to be beholden to the banks and credit cards - especially with the call for EMV/NFC PoS terminals to be rolled out next year for nearly $300-$500 each. Apparently they (a consortium of large brand name franchises including CVS, 7-11, Dunkin Donut) didn't want to be controlled and held hostage by ApplePay's self enclosed ecosystem. Just look at the price the banks are paying who are virtually subsiding the system's fees.\n\nThese franchises have set up a consortium called Merchant Customer Exchange (MCX) and will be working with a cloud based provider called Paydiant to store customer financial information. To secure the data transaction, they'll use these Currentc tokens between the Pos to the cloud. To incentivize customers, these stores will offer discounts and rewards for using the system which would also eliminate the credit card fees. \n\nSome wild guess takeaways:\n1. Our economy as we know it is entering a full digital age and all the heavy weights are on the playing field and quickly taking sides for our money. \n2. Cyber security for cloud based platforms will be big business.\n3. These battles for the consumer will rapidly increase the everyday consumer's knowledge of digital wallets, but trusting those systems will take time. Good for bitcoin.\n4. Bitcoin has an advantage of having multiple cross application - remittances, micro-payments, lending, derivatives, store of value, currency. PoS and e-commerce represent just a slice of where bitcoin can prove to be useful. \n\nBottom line: this is all a part of Bitcoin's hurdle rate - likewise for ApplePay and MCX.
