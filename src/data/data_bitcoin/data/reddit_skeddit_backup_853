It's kind of like the envy of the world. No one else can deposit money into an exchange directly from their bank account instantly but Canadians. All 3 Canadian exchanges support Interac online. (VOS, CaVirtex, QuadregaCX). If your bank doesn't support Interac Online these exchanges can do a direct withdrawal via EFT (takes 3-5 days) from your bank account. The exchanges are the best, cheapest and with Interac fastest way to buy Bitcoin. They require KYC of varying strictness depending on the deposit methods you will use. \n\nIf you don't want to go through the KYC process of the exchanges QuickBt, InstaBt, and Instacoins allow you to buy online near instantly with Interac Online. These charge quite the mock up and I have used ATMs that have lower fees than them. These also have limits on amount purchased (QuickBt is 0.2 BTC, InstaBt is 0.5).\n\nSo yeah Bitcoin ATMs you can use but they charge a high mock up as well. Same as Local Bitcoins. But those two methods are inconvenient. \n\nLike I said Interac Online is best method and the only instant method in Canada it's also the cheapest way to but Bitcoin if done through an exchange. \n\nOnly the fallowing  support Interac online:\n\n* BMO Bank of Montreal\n* Envision Financial\n* Libro Credit Union\n* Scotiabank\n* TD Canada Trust\n* RBC Royal Bank\n\nNote even if you have account at one of those banks it will not work with accounts that have a Visa debit card (TD most notably). \n\nMyself I use Tangerine as main bank so when I want to buy Bitcoin instantly I do an Interac email money transfer (e-transfer) this (unlike Interac Online) is supported by pretty much all banks and credit unions. This allows you to send money near  instantly (takes about 30 min to arrive) to any Bank account for a $1-$1.50 fee. So I do e-transfer to my BMO account on the side and then deposit to exchange via Interac online. BMO is only of the big 5 that offer a Pay-As-You-go account where it is no monthly fee only $1 per transaction. The 4 biggest banks offer $4 a month account with 10-12 free transactions a month. \n\nEven if you pay $1 for e-transfer and $1-2 dollars to bank then $1.50 to VOS for deposit this is instant and still cheaper than the (I think it's) $7 they charge for an EFT.

No one can quite anticipate what that will look like yet, but it most definitely will not be this piddly use-bitcoin-to-buy-shit-from-Amazon model so many people seem to have. Bitcoin cynics simply lack the intuition of what is possible, they\'re trying to conceptually fit a square peg into a round hole . . . they see it doesn\'t fit and can\'t imagine why anyone would think it ever would. Most Bitcoiners recognize the cyrptocurrency economy hasn\'t been built yet. Merchant adoption is not the goal, it is just a phase of adoption. Investors in cryptocurrency are investing in the future. We are thinking much bigger than you guys realize, but you don\'t understand it isn\'t Bitcoin per se that we see becoming huge . . . it is the whole cryptocurrency economy that will become huge. We are talking world changing huge. \n\nThe reason Bitcoin is undergoing the current decline is because there is serious doubt among cryptocurrency investors about whether Bitcoin itself represents the cryptocurrency economy. No serious bitcoiner is doubting the future of cryptocurrency, we are just in doubt about Bitcoin itself with regard to that future. These doubts started with the 51% issue over the summer and today bitcoin is being hammered daily by new and improved consensus algorithms or altcoins or crypto projects that seem to be just moving ahead at light speed while the Bitcoin devs seem asleep at the wheel. There is constant question about whether PoW is sustainable, the lack of any action from the core devs, and other fundamental questions about Bitcoin\'s long term viability as the leader in the space. Then you jokers show up with all of your lame "ponzi-scheme" and "told you so" arguments . . . they just sound stupid, there are bigger issues here.
