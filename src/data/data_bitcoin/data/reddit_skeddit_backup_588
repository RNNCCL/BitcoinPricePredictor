Bitcoin. \n\nYou think the government want\'s to pay the national debit?? \n\nHell no,  they can dump the dollar, dump all their debit, and blame it on the libertarians by letting bitcoin take hold. \n\nThe most patriotic bunch, and the hard working, employer class will get the blame, the government will say " we had no choice but to dump the dollar, we wanted to pay China but we couldn\'t, (or we did with massively devalued currency)  \n\nso doesn\'t the dollar failing actually save the Government, and can\'t they start fresh with no debit, use honest money, force everyone else to use honest money, and stay on top due to past investments into military?? \n\nwe basically borrow money, buy an army, then close the banks so no one else can borrow money.  We end up being the only ones with F-22s and aircraft carriers so we stay top dog, have no debit, and force the rest of the world to use honest money, so they can never afford a war let along a war against us with all the cool gadgets.  \n\nThe government side steps the blame, and reaps all the benefits.  \n\nEssentially we BK morally and financially but stay on top. \n\nTo do this they need bitcoin, and for bitcoin to grab hold they need the "grey" markets to adopt first and blend into the "white" markets.  \n\nThey are playing chess,  so many of us are playing checkers.   \n\nEdit:  and lets not forget they end up with a transparent, easily taxable currency and no debit. Bitcoin may be anonymous but it makes any large black or grey market easy to spot and deal with.   They may not be able to tax every transaction but think of the power of at least being able to see every transaction.  Ever play a video game where you got to build a little city but there is a "fog of war" so you can\'t see the whole map,  then eventually you get the ability to see the whole picture..........and it\'s a game changer.    This is what governments get if they get a currency like bitcoin to take over.  They get to see the whole economy, every transaction.   Even if they can\'t tax the black market think of the advantage of just being able to see it, judge it\'s size, and watch the money flow.  \n\nAlso, by forcing the rest of the world to use honest currency it ends anyone\'s ability to make war, let alone against us.  It also makes tracking terrorists amazingly easy. Just donate one satoshi to a terrorist and watch it flow through the block chain.  You can see how they take it in, how they wash it, and how they spend it.  \n\nTerrorists are amazingly stupid if they use bitcoin.  I have money in bitcoin as an investment and I think it will take over, but I think maybe we are jumping out of the frying pan and into the fire once again.    \n\n\n\n\n': 5}, ('The Bitcoin Pinata : Crack it and Claim your bounty of 10 BTC', 151): {'[deleted]': 10, 'Fair enough, it was just a thought.': 3, 'Instructions unclear, speakers covered in cream cheese ': 4, "That's the whole point of the contest.": 9, "Hahaha yeah.\n\nBut you are looking at the wrong branch; Pi\xc3\xb1ata is taking raw entropy from dom0 and adding inter-event instruction counts and readings of **RDRAND**, mixing it through Fortuna RNG.

As we progress further into the new year of 2015, we are beginning to solidify our plans for expansion. In this post, we want to share both our current and future plans.  \n\n>Increase Mining Capacity\n\n>Similar to most markets, cryptocurrency mining is extremely competitive and aggressive expansion is the only way to remain relevant. In the coming months, we will be implementing some changes designed to grow the pool's capacity and fuel development.\n\n>At some point in the future, the base pricing for contracts will be increased. This will enable us to prioritize our larger users and focus on expansion. Furthermore, we are working with our partners in China to allocate an additional 50 Gh/s of hashing power to our pool on a monthly basis. With this kind of growth, we expect to easily remain competitive and profitable.  \n\n>Payment Timeframe  \n\n>In response to the large number of support tickets we have been receiving, we wanted to broadly address the most common questions and concerns regarding payment withdrawals.  \n\n>To begin, we will offer some insight into our procedure for processing payouts. Payments are filtering and prioritized according to the frequency of requests from that particular user. **For example, users with less frequent requests will receive priority over users with frequent requests. This was implemented to prevent those already in the queue from waiting to receive any previous withdrawal requests. In other words, a 300\xe2\x82\xac balance divided into six 50\xe2\x82\xac withdrawals will be processed faster than thirty separate 10\xe2\x82\xac withdrawals.**  \n\n>Any unprocessed transactions will be returned back to the user's account balance to accumulate. Users are welcome to place another withdrawal request at their convenience. Using the methods described above, we expect the system to resolve itself soon and once again process payouts smoothly.  \n\n>Personal Support  \n\n>As usual, we are aware of the inconvenience and frustration this may cause to some users. Given the recent market instability, we are doing our best to restore service and have bright plans for the future. In the mean time, we will be making efforts to communicate more frequently with the community. Users can expect daily updates and even phone support in the near future.  \n\n>We have also received confirmation from CryptoPay regarding our monthly limits and expect to have a definitive answer soon. In the mean time, our weekly transaction volume will be limited to 100,000\xe2\x82\xac.  \n\n>We thank you for your continued support.  \n\n>Warmest Regards,  \nCoIntellect Staff\n\nBold emphasis mine.

If you don\'t have an old computer lying around you can probably get one for 50 euros remember it only has to work once. Think of it as buying peace of mind.\n\nI ran the paper wallet generator offline (this laptop will never connect to the internet so these private keys are guaranteed cold) and I printed 5 copies of the same wallet. I also BIP38 encrypted it so it requires the private key AND a password to redeem the funds.\n\nPut them in sealed envelopes and then into waterproof plastic ziplock bags. I kept 2 in my house at different points, one with my parents, one with my brother, and one with my best friend. So if my house ever burned to the ground I have 3 redundant back ups of my private key.\n\nEven if someone say broke into my parents house and stole a copy of the wallet, its still useless to them without the password. The only other person who has both a copy of the wallet AND knows my password is my brother. He also has 21 BTC and I hold copies of his and know his password. The idea being if anything ever happened to one of us the other would inherit the coins.\n\nI have admittedly gone "full Batman" on this but I basically said to myself "pretend this is \xc2\xa310 million.

Are you holding BTC?': 1, 'Quit looking into market speculations and hoping to win some cash without work. Instead try to focus on the technology and how it can help you save money, or increase your productivity. \n\nIf you are interested in some long term save your assets, you might want to look at Bitshares, concept such as bitassets. So take for example these currencies are backed by market pegged assets real closely to the price of Bitcoin, or any other alternative coin you can imagine, plus Gold, silver etc... \n\nThe way it works these things are backed by the original Bitshares (its a 300% frational reserve banking collateral, think of it as decentralized semi-FDIC). Unless the original Bitshares TOTALLY collapse and I mean like in one day drop over 600% in value then you would lose like 50% of whatever your original asset is worth. If its over a short period of a month, you could very easily be able to get your assets before the collateral hits. Therefore the risk is so minimal, and there is still a chance for great returns especially in BitGold since the number one asset in the world that has always beat everything out there is Gold, except now you have it protected mathematically with all the benefits of BTC like protections. You could use shapeshift.io or bter.com exchange to get yourself some bitassets. Once again I warn you, Bitshares is very different than all the other cryptocurrencies you have so far heard of. So I would not really call it an "alt-coin." They try to focus on solving some of the market price volatilities in BTC while retaining the values of its blockchain benefits.

This happened when the 250 KB soft limit was hit. Luckily it was a soft limit and could be quickly removed. If this limit is a hard one, that will not be easy to remove, and it might cause an extended period of block space shortage, until the entire userbase finally transitions to an updated client. An extreme and extended shortage of block space could cause permanent reputational damage to Bitcoin and cause many people to give up on it.\n\nAnother thing is that we might not see any major adoption pushes until the 1 MB anti-spam restriction is removed. This is because until the hard fork happens, major investors don't have a clear picture of when and how the hard fork will happen and therefore might not feel confident investing in campaigns to sign up retail merchants that might not get any txs due to space running out in blocks.

It can\'t.  The limit is 1MB per block the actual transaction capacity depends on the average transaction size and realistically that provides no more than 2 to 4 tps. To achieve 7 tps using one block of 1 MB every 600 seconds means that **the average transaction size must be 240 bytes** (1,000,000 bytes / 600 seconds / 7tps = 240 bytes).  If you have a Bitcoin wallet handy take a look at your last dozen transactions and if you don\'t have a wallet handy use a website to lookup the transactions in the most recent block.  In either case how many of the transactions were under 240 bytes? Not very many.  I am going to say the majority of your transactions were probably between 300 and 700 bytes.  \n\nCan you form a 240 byte transaction?  Sure as long as you only have only a single input.  A transaction input is requires at least 147 bytes so an average of 240 bytes per transaction is not possible unless the average number of inputs is less than 2.  While some transactions may have one input on average they are going to have more.   The total number of inputs in the blockchain will roughly equal the the total number of outputs.  **As the number of blocks approaches infinity the ratio of inputs to outputs in a well functioning blockchain will approach 1:1.**\n\nSince most outputs will eventually become inputs it makes more sense to look at block capacity using a balanced transactions as a template for transaction size.  A balanced transaction is one where the number of inputs equals the number of outputs.  Single input, single output exceptions are both rare and have limited use.   A 2 input, 2 output transaction using all compressed keys and P2PKH scripts is typical and weighs in at 373 bytes.  **At 373 bytes per transaction and 1MB per block the network will not exceed 4.4 tps..**  This is already 37% less than claimed but it is still unrealistic as it represents the smallest possible balanced transaction.\n\nMost transactions are going to be larger than 373 bytes due to the use of uncompressed keys being used, more complex scripts, and a higher number of inputs being used.  Looking at the last million transactions in the blockchain I found the average txn size was 560 bytes.  **At 560 bytes per transaction and 1MB per block the network will not exceed 3.0 tps.**  This is very likely to decrease over time as transaction sizes creep higher as multisig and other more complex scripts are used more frequently. A good estimate for the network throughput when limited to 1MB blocks would be 2 to 4 tps depending on how optimistic (naive) you want to be.\n\nHere is a direct comparison of the combined script size for some different types of scripts.  The scriptPubKey is encoded in a transaction output and the scriptSig is encoded in the transaction that "spends" that output.  Since outputs eventually become inputs in new transactions the combined size of the scriptPubKey and scriptSig represents the "roundtrip" script cost of a transaction.\n\n*Code:*\n\n      | P2PkH:  | 131 bytes per script round trip | (25 byte scriptPubKey +  106 byte scriptSig)\n|-------|---------|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------\n2-of-3  | P2SH:  | 253 bytes per script round trip | (22 byte scriptPubKey  +   231 byte scriptSig)  \n3-of-5  | P2SH:  | 383 bytes per script round trip | (22 byte scriptPubKey  +   361 byte scriptSig) \n15-of-15| P2SH: | 1,481 bytes per script round trip | (22 byte scriptPubKey + 1,459 byte scriptSig) \n\nHow many transactions are possible per megabyte of block capacity?

Much like gold, users could primarily acquire Bitcoins to use as a store of value (savings) and use other currencies for routine purchases.  If Bitcoin had a very low velocity (like bullion) the smaller transaction capacity could support more users.  There is nothing wrong with this idea in general (and it might even happen with larger block sizes) but those thinking this is a solution to the incredibly small transaction capacity imposed by the 1MB restriction probably fail to realize just how restrictive it is. \n\nI don't know how exactly how widely adopted Bitcoin will become or how quickly that adoption will occur.  I do know however that a permanent 1MB restriction ensures Bitcoin can not scale even if only used as a store of value (infrequent high value transactions) without using trusted third parties.  If the objective of such a system would be to provide a decentralized, portable, and liquid savings that **users have direct control over** without a third party acting as an intermediary then it is true there is no need for enough transaction capacity to allows dozens of transactions a day per user, but meaningful access would need to be dozens of transactions per year.  The best comparison would be a savings account.  Daily purchases are not paid from savings so the number of transactions involving the savings account is lower than a checking account or credit card but to be useful users will still need to make a number of transactions into and out of savings each year.  **If your savings account or brokerage account restricted you to only one deposit per quarter and one withdrawal per year I would imagine you would look for something better.**  The numbers below are for 2tps, for those who have a more optimistic view on future transaction sizes you could double these numbers but it would still provide a negligible number of supported users.\n\n*Code:*\n\nMaximum supported users based on transaction frequency.\n\nAssumptions: 1MB block, 821 bytes per txn\n\nThroughput:  2.03 tps, 64,000,000 transactions annually\n\nTotal # direct users  |    Transactions per user annually | Transaction Frequency\n----------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------\n     <8,000             |    8760       |      Once an hour\n  178,000                |    365       |     Once a day\n500,000                  |     128       |     A few (2.4) times a week\n 1,200,000              |      52       |      Once a week\n2,600,000               |     24     \t|          Twice a month\n 5,300,000              |      12\t |           Once a month\n16,000,000              |      4 \t   |            Once a quarter\n 64,000,000               |     1          |     Once a year\n 200,000,000              |    0.3        |     Less than once every few years\n1,000,000,000           |     0.06       |     Less than once a decade\n\nAs you can see even with an average transaction frequency of just once a week or once a month the network can't support more than a token number of users.  **When someone advocates a permanent cap of 1MB what they are saying is I think Bitcoin will be great if it is never used by more than a couple million users making less than one transaction per month.**  Such a system will never flourish as a store of value as it is eclipsed by alternatives which are more inclusive.  To support even 100 million direct users making an average of one transaction every two weeks would require a throughput of 82 tps and an average block size of 20 to 40 Megabytes.\n\n*1MB doesn't can't even keep up with existing non-retail payment networks.*\n\nGoing back to that coffee meme, the implied message is that 1MB is fine unless for everything else.  You know substantial stuff like paying your mortgage, business deals, major capital expenditures, or paying a supplier for inventory.  This just isn't the case though.  **Do you know anyone who pays for coffee with a bank wire?** The FedWire service (run by US federal reserve) processes ~150 million bank wires annually.   The FedWire service only operates in the US.  Internationally the largest clearinghouse is SWIFT and it processes more than 5 billion transfers annually.  The US ACH network is even larger with 19 billion transactions annually (excluding converted checks).  There are also about 2 billion international remittances annually (western union, moneygram, and other networks).  A 1MB restricted Bitcoin network couldn't even keep up with these transfer networks even if you forget about retail sales completely.  **The idea keeping the 1MB restriction, only keeps limits the utility of small payments is simply incorrect.**\n\nCode:\n\nBitcoin block size to reach comparable network volume based on average txn size\n\n| Network  |  txn volume  |    Average | transaction | size\n| ----------- |--------------|------------|----------------|-----------------\n| -   | annually (mil)  |  373 bytes |  560 bytes  | 833 bytes\nFedWire   |    150      |         1.1 MB  |    1.7 MB   |   2.3 MB\nRemittance |  2,000     |         14.2 MB  |   21.3 MB  |   31.7 MB\nSWIFT     |  5,000         |     35.5 MB   |  53.3 MB   |  79.3 MB\nACH     |   19,000     |        134.8 MB  |  202.4 MB  |  301.0 MB\n\n*On a transaction fee basis.*\n\nCurrently the cost of the network is roughly $300 million annually. The users of the network are collectively purchasing $300 mil worth of security each year.  If users paid $400 million the network would be more secure and if they paid $200 million it would be less secure. Today the majority of this cost is paid indirectly (or subsidized) through the creation of new coins but it is important to keep in mind the total unsubsidized security cost.  At 2 tps the network the unsubsidized cost per transaction would be about $5. At 100 tps it would be $0.05.  If Bitcoin was widely adopted, more users purchasing more coins should mean a higher exchange rate and thus the value of potential attacks also rises.  The future cost of the network will need to rise to ensure that attacks are not economical and non-economic attacks are prohibitively expense relative to the benefit for the attacker.   It may not rise linearly but it will need to rise.   If someday one Bitcoin is worth $10,000 and we are still only spending $300 million a year on security we probably are going to have a problem.  Now advocates of keeping the limit may argue that the majority of the network cost won't be paid by fees for many years but the reality is that with the limit on potential transactions there are only two other ways to balance the equation and that is much higher fees or much lower security.\n\n*Conclusion*\n\nThe blockchain permanently restricted to 1MB is great if you are a major bank looking to co-opt the network for a next generation limited trust settlement network between major banks, financial service providers, and payment processors.

Those favoring a permanent 1MB cap saying that Bitcoin can still be a financial backbone of sorts they don\'t know how right they are.  The problem isn\'t a limit in general but that 1MB is so low that under any meaningful adoption scenario it will push all individual users off the blockchain to rely on trusted third parties. 1MB is useless for end user direct access but is sufficient for a inter-"bank" settlement network.  If the cap is not raised to some higher limit that allows a larger number of users to maintain direct access, then the individual will be priced out of the blockchain.  If or when that happens Bitcoin becomes yet another network you have no direct (peer) access to, just like FedWire, SWIFT, and other private closed transfer networks. **There is no realistic scenario where a network capped permanently at 1MB can both have meaningful adoption and still maintain direct access to the blockchain by individuals.**  To be clear by direct access I mean an transacting on-chain without relying on an intermediary or trusted third party.\n\n*Quote*\n\n>Bitcoin ... A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.\n\nSatoshi Nakamoto - [Bitcoin Whitepaper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf)\n\n*Can we stop talking about a cup of coffee please?*\n\nYou may have heard someone say something like "Every $5 starbucks coffee doesn\'t need to be on the blockchain so there is no need to raise the limit".   The implied message is that while the cost of permanently keeping the limit is that trivial purchases will be knocked off chain you will still have direct access to the blockchain for everything else.   This however is a strawman argument, the 1MB restriction puts such a chokehold on transaction capacity that even larger more meaningful transactions will eventually be knocked off as well.\n\nBefore we get to why a permanent 1MB cap kills any utility for the network I also want to point out that in my opinion having everything on a single blockchain including dust and sub penny transactions is just as extreme and will leads to practical issues with scalability.  Centralization and trusted third parties isn\'t always bad. <gasp>.  Context matters so try to read the rest before freaking out.  I don\'t really care if my morning coffee is paid for using a centralized service.  Have you ever given or received a gift card?   Can\'t get more centralized than that.  The reality is if I put $100 in Bitcoins in a third party managed wallet or in an account linked debit card the risk and scope of that centralization is limited.  Sidechains provide the potential for a trust free alternative but they still require individuals to have some transaction capacity on the primary chain.  The 1MB is insufficient to support any meaningful number of direct users even if transaction capacity requirements are reduced by moving some transactions off the primary chain.\n\nIt is critical that individuals retain the ability to use the blockchain directly.  If direct access becomes prohibitive then your options are to rely on a third party or exit the network altogether.  If that happens, then this experiment has been for nothing.  A huge amount of time and energy will have been spent on reinvented a settlement network between trusted peers.  In other words rebuilding an  interbank network.  What does it matter if the resource requirements of running a full node are modest if the economic cost to transact on that network is prohibitive for any individual?\n\nUnder any scenario where adoption leads to a significant number of users the transaction demand will greatly exceed the very restricted on chain capacity.  If the difference between user demand and finite block capacity is large the only realistic outcome is one where end user transactions are handled by third parties which are not trustless.  As the portion handled by these third parties (aggregators) grows they will make mutual agreements to facilitate cross entity transactions off chain.  An example of a cross entity transaction would be where the customer of Trusted Entity A wishes to pay the customer of Trusted Entity B.  If A & B trust each other enough to extend a mutual line of credit then transactions between users of A & B can occur off-chain and instantly by just having both entities update their internal ledgers.  This can occur for multiple transactions between A & B but it will leads to an imbalance where one entity owes the other entity the net amount of the sum of all the individual transactions.  The entities would need to "settle up" periodically by transferring the accumulated balance with an on-chain transactions.  The important part is that one settlement between trusted peers can reconcile the results of thousands or even millions of individual end user transactions.  \n\nIf you think this scenario is impossible then you haven\'t considered just how tiny the current transaction capacity is.  It is a token amount which realistically is no more than two to four transactions per second.  WIn a settlement network the upper limit on the number of settlements required grows exponentially with the number of trusted peers.  Just two hundred trusted peers (crypto banks) with unsettled off chain transactions would require twenty thousand transactions to settle.  You no longer have meaningful direct access to the blockchain if it is economically prohibitive to pay for an on-chain transaction.  When you as an individual have been reduced to a position where you must outbid a bank to record in the blockchain then you are going to lose access.  Fees that are hundreds or thousands of times higher would still be a low cost of doing business for third parties.  Remember the third parties can collect fees on all those individual off-chain transactions to pay for the periodic settlements needed to reconcile with their trusted peers.\n\n*Wait I don\'t get how off blockchain transactions could occur across entities*\n\nSay someday Chase and HSBC both handle Bitcoin payments and thousands of customers of each bank request to make payments to customers of the other bank.  Chase and HSBC can swap information on these transactions and internally update their ledgers.  Thousands of transactions can occur instantly and without any need for individual records on the blockchain.  Both entities collect fees from their customers and it has negligible cost for both entities.  However the net amount of the thousands of transactions will result in one entity having a balanced owed to the other.  This is why settlement networks require some level of trust.   It requires trusted peers to extend mutual lines of credit.  The more they trust each other, the larger the lines of credit the less frequently they need to settle.  It is also why you will never be a peer on this network.  In advance both entities have signed agreements to extend each other a short term credit until the next settlement.  In the traditional banking world it would be no longer than the next business day but using the blockchain the same thing can be done with less capital and less risk by settling automatically every hour.  So if the sum of the amounts paid to HSBC customers by Chase Customers is 100,000 BTC and the sum of the amounts paid to Chase customers by HSBC customers is 30,000 BTC then the net result of these thousands of customer transactions is that Chase has a balanced owed to HSBC for 70,000 BTC.   In this example Chase and HSBC may have extended a line of credit to each other for 200,000 BTC for a period of not more than 4 hours.  Chase would make a single blockchain transaction to HSBC for 30,000 BTC to meet the terms of the agreement.  At this point the balance has been reconciled and the books of both entities are now balanced (BTC held equals BTC owed to customers).  As new transactions occurs a balance is owed one entity by the other and eventually it will be settled.\n\nNow when demand for transactions exceeds what is possible in a block who do you think can pay more in fees?  You and your individual transaction or an third party whose who only needs to settle periodically and has been collecting fees for all the off chain transactions that make up that settlement.  The 1MB limit provides a token amount of capacity that when third parties are generating enough settlement transactions to fill the blocks (every block) and willing to pay whatever fee is necessary to ensure timely settlement you have effectively priced out of the network.': 30, "It already is a significant burden on home broadband and storage as is.

Mining Pooling eliminated the need for miners, even those that small to run a full node. The discussion on the need for incentives for full nodes has been ongoing in the last year or so.

Personally I argue that is not enough incentive because those operating SPV client wallet will of course run 1 full-node + use a Block explorer API for other things if needed. Hence you still end up with few Full-Nodes my theoretical solution would be to modify Full-Nodes to be able to run more complex information channels tied to blockchain transactions or for them to do special processes in the case of At-Blockchain transactions. The last are the ones that serve more than 1 purpose as it is the case of lets say those that carry file hashes in a on-blockchain transaction that then is used to verify file integrity automatically or similar things. Then a micropayment channel for Full-nodes as Justus Ranvier argues on is indeed useful as then the incentives are enough for people wanting to run a full-node for more than altruistic reasons.

Also, that trying to train a user-base or worse, a market, to behave differently to accommodate IT constraints is a Sisyphean task. There are probably hundreds of IT experts who are concerned about the block size limit, because they can see the risks in it, which they recognize from prior (usually bitter) experience.\n\n>And, this is where the role of Core Dev is crucial. If there are major efficiencies to be had, "low-hanging fruit", then it would be wonderful to see them go live and reflected in smaller blocks etc. But right now, we can only project forwards, from what is happening with the average block size\n\nAnd we\'ve seen the harm of a soft limit before. When the 250 kB soft limit was hit, there were widespread complaints and dissatisfaction with long delays for txs getting confirmed.\n\nLuckily it was a soft limit and it could be lifted relatively quickly. There are so many things that could go wrong when a hard limit is hit.\n\nThe assumption that we can restrain block size growth if we find that it\'s outpacing people\'s broadband connection speeds has been validated by experience. Several deliberate and coordinated dev/mining community measures have restrained the block size in the past, including the 250 KB soft limit.\n\nYour argument that it\'s better to risk a too low hard limit than a too high one has no legs to stand on IMO.\n\n>There\'s nothing against Bitcoin\'s mission that states that you cannot have services built on top of it.\n\nBitcoin\'s mission statement is to create a peer-to-peer electronic cash that allows people to transfer money without going through a financial intermediary.
