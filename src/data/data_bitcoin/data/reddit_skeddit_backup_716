There are some interesting explanations for that in this thread.\n\nMy humble opinion is, most people think cynicism is a shortcut for being street smart (which has much to do with the asymmetry between social consequences of looking like a fool and being too distrustful, even though both are equally wrong).\n\nGathering from the Bitcoin forums, some even seem to think being cynical somehow helps prevent other people getting fooled.

A professor I spoke to has kids involved in computers and robotics, who have explored Bitcoin in past years and told her, so she was very positive and open. Others (in the \'highly educated\' category) mostly don\'t really see the value, but they are open to learning.\n\nThe common middle class people (Uber drivers, regular normal everyday people) seem to either be quite open to learning, or in the case of one small business restaurant, the owners were very very suspicious and said, "Money is already getting less \'real\' every day, so we don\'t need this too now".\n\nAs for myself, I originally dismissed it utterly and completely, when an \'acquaintance\' first told me about it and was proselytizing its virtues about 2-3 years ago. I did not even consider it long enough to look into it. It must have just seemed very unbelievable, \'too good to be true\', \'cult-ish\' (huge part of it, since emotionally when my friend told me, he was a big conspiracy guy too and he was speaking very \'feverishly\', so I really didn\'t even take him seriously), spammy, and a waste of time.\n\nWhat changed my stance is when that same friend a while later tried a \'social experiment\' and sent 0.5 BTC to whoever requested it and explained why. I did it, because free money so what the heck? I remember the first time I heard the beep in my blockchain.info account and saw it arrive, it felt like magic. I was pretty ecstatic, to put it lightly. Ever since then, I was converted, and have been kicking myself for not being more open-minded when I was first introduced such a long time before then.\n\nWhat I think my acquaintaince/friend should have done differently, and what anyone should do differently is this: Preface the explanation of Bitcoin by admitting how big a deal it really is. Say upfront that it is a topic with vast implications, and there is a lot one could potentially learn/read on this. It\'s not a simple thing. Then, just give the person the option to either a) hear you teach them the mountains of info about it, or b) give them only practical information/benefits that affect them directly. Either way, emphasize security, and remember that every person is different.

Plus, even in the cases you\'re citing, it\'s domestic only. Not international. For people with friends/family abroad or simply for those who travel abroad, not having to deal with currency conversion and having a simply method to pay with a global currency (bitcoin) is a benefit that nothing else has. Granted, this aspect is still being built out, but as adoption continues, you\'ll see more and more of this.\n\nI disagree with the alt comment; I think it\'s mostly hype. See blockstream, factom, counterparty (with ethereum integrated), storj, etc. These few companies alone allow virtually anything to take place using Bitcoin... like all that futuristic stuff you hear about that involves \'programmable money\' (business to business, machine to machine, machine to human, etc) that the recent Winklevoss presentation really, really spelled out well.\n\nAnd the biggest benefit behind Bitcoin that you can try to explain to people is how it\'s simply \'better money\' than virtually ANY other form of money in existence (effect = it will likely maintain its value much better than holding a fiat currency, or holding precious metals). Yes, it\'s new (and inherently volatile as a result: the volatility is 100% natural and a good thing indicating health and organic growth), but it is superior and, being superior, it has legitimate value. Value eventually is recognized and accepted. Its ecosystem, the players behind it, and the money invested into it have created momentum, and only increase the chances that this \'new\' technology will survive and continue to grow. This whole \'history of money\' thing is how Bitcoin is typically presented by the experts, if you\'ll notice, in their videos. The reason is it is extremely significant. The deeper point of Bitcoin is what makes it so special, of course in addition to everything else.\n\nOn the above note, to expand... one thing I haven\'t really seen before is a better comparison of Bitcoin vs. Gold vs. Fiat. Fiat has intrinsic value in the sense the government\'s tax ability and military exists. But, bitcoin also DOES have intrinsic value, and this intrinsic value will only grow, as opposed to the lack of intrinsic value of gold. This is because bitcoin is not actually pure currency as we all know, but rather a \'token\' of sorts that can be used in many different contexts and with a massive computing network backing it, providing incredible security and power. Gold has no such thing, or minimal intrinsic value (jewelry mainly, but it represents a tiny portion). So, in the comparison of Gold vs. Bitcoin (the only two alternatives to fiat that are not vulnerable to inflation), Bitcoin wins even in the intrinsic value department! And Bitcoin will only continue to increase in intrinsic value as the ecosystem develops even further and adoption rises. It\'s a massive virtuous circle, in my eyes, with many positive feedback loops. I find this significant, since there is currently about $7 trillion USD stored in gold, making it ripe to be eaten into by Bitcoin (because it\'s an objectively superior store of value), as time passes.\n\nAnyway, I wrote more than I intended, but hope it helps.': 2, "People fear what they don't understand. Simple as that.  That fear has many manifestations such as fear, hate etc.": 11, 'Pretty much everyone thinks bitcoin can\'t work when they first learn about it, it\'s just that some people take the additional steps required to understand what is actually happening with the technology and why it could have potential.

That\'s why from their perspective bitcoin is always about to crash any day now, it\'s not about facts, it\'s about comfort. It\'s also why when talking to people that are anti-bitcoin they will rarely actually understand basic principles of the technology ("blockchain is great but bitcoin can\'t work!" etc). \n\nThey don\'t want to validate bitcoin by taking time to learn about it because that would amount to admitting defeat, so they are trapped in a low information - high confusion state.': 12, 'because every individual will need to hire their own police force and mercenaries with which to defend themselves. \n\nthat sounds a lot like having your own little fiefdom.

TransactionSigner implementations can be added to the wallet and will be serialized into and out of the users saved wallet file. Signers are given a transaction to sign in sequence. This is intended for risk analysis providers to provide a class that talks to their server to get a signature of the right form, so that all bitcoinj based wallets can be easily upgraded to support the new provider.:"': 3, 'It increased by over 200k on Nov 29.

So someone out there generates a private key with their wallet, converts it to a public key, then hashes that to create an address. This is the classic, traditional, old fashioned bitcoin address. You send money to it, and the person who holds the original private key can then spend it themselves. This is called paying to a public key hash.\n\n> Addresses that start with a 3 are more complex. Instead of generating that address by hashing a public key, instead what you hash is a SCRIPT! Wow what\'s that. A script is a set of instructions written in bitcoin script op codes that run a little program before the coin can be spent again. The popular use case for this is multisig. So if I run a company (like dark wallet, or ethereum) and I want our bitcoins to require multiple signatures to spend, I cook up a script that says "2 of 3 to spend" hash it, and thus create a pay to script hash address.

Hence you have to pay more in tx fees. \n\n2) They are distinguishable from regular addresses (as we see from this post) and can potentially constitute a privacy leak in some instances. \n\n3) P2SH is limited in the number of keys that can be used.\n\nA threshold signature uses a standard pay-to-pubkey-hash addresses but the private key is instead broken into 'shares' similar to Shamir's Secret Sharing.\n\nThe difference between SSS and a threshold signature is...\n\n1) With a threshold signature the key doesn't need to be generated on a single device and then split... instead the shares can be created independently of each other.\n\n2) The shares do not need to be brought together and combined to create a valid signature. Each share creates a sort of partial signature then they are combined to produce the valid signature.\n\nSo using threshold signatures allows you to do multisig using standard bitcoin addresses and avoid the problems with P2SH.\n\nWe will likely be switching to threshold signatures in our project in our project sometime in the future. \n\nhttps://www.bitcoinauthenticator.org/\n\nPaper: http://eprint.iacr.org/2014/629.pdf": 1, "Is there a 3rd signature?

You always have an nLocktime transaction that return all the funds to you after a desired number of blocks (you can set the number in the "settings" page. They also have a site  [site](http://greenaddress.github.io/gentle/#/view1) to redeem your funds from the zipped transaction and they give you also the [source code] (https://github.com/greenaddress/gentle) if you think that one day they can escape and shutdown the site.\n\nAn other simpler solution to protect your funds with Greenaddress if you don\'t trust them is to make an additional "account"  2of3 linked to the same seed. \n\nIn that process you have to write down an additional seed and take note of the additional master public. If you do that you will be able to redeem the funds in that account  with an electrum plugin (version 2.0) or doing some coding yourself whenever you want even if the have blackmailed you. The only drawback is that you loose the feature of Instant transaction (which I don\'t use so much today).\n\nThe best practice in my opinion is to keep in the "main" account only the amount you want handy to use their instant confirmation feature and the rest in a 2of3 subaccount.\n\nIf you look for alternative Bitgo or Copay are interesting even if IMHO Greenaddress is better from a security point of view (I personally tend to prefer randomly generated seeds) and it also supports hardware wallets (hardwarewallets.com) also with Android devices.

Even in such a very optimistic case in the end all the votes would be stored in anonymous records and this unverifiable data, processed by unverifiable electronic procedures, would decide the (unverifiable) winner of the election. To accept electronic electoral result ordinary people need to have an absolute faith in the accuracy, honesty and security of the whole electoral apparatus (people, software, hardware and networks). This is not possible today.\n\nCapitalism in the US is dead. Can't have capitalism without competition. The markets are rigged and manipulation is rampant. The US economy is a cleptocrats wet dream. Capitalism cannot grow the way it has grown over the last 70 years. It is at a new stage of low to no growth, stagnation and long-term downward crisis. There have been 10 previous economic crises in the last 70 years. In each recession there have been mass layoffs and mass unemployment, but after each crisis, capitalism revived, workers were rehired, and employment eventually reached levels higher than before the crisis began.\n\nCapitalist overproduction always caused these recessions. Production under capitalism expands very rapidly so long as there are markets. This is because of the laws of capitalist competition. The capitalists are in a permanent race to out-produce each other, to outsell each other and to capture the markets from each other as each wants to gain the most profit. This competition drives the system.\n\nThe latest collapse lasted from the end of 2007 to June of 2009. The so-called \xe2\x80\x9crecovery\xe2\x80\x9d has lasted four years now. But this is clearly a recovery for the bosses and the bankers. Profits and executive pay have gone steadily up. There has been a slight rise in production. But there are still close to 40 million workers who are unemployed, underemployed, forced to work part time, or who have dropped out of the work force altogether. This is four years after the capitalists announced the so-called recovery.\n\nTo conclude, the economic system is not going to recover. There is only greater crisis in the future. The automatic processes of capitalist recovery and the traditional methods of forcing it back to life have all failed.\n\nBitcoin and blockchain technology can bring back the days of real democracy and fair capitalism.

[Here's](https://github.com/7trXMk6Z/simple-electrum-seed-encryption) the github page for it, which has the source code.\n\nThe input is the twelve words, all lowercase with a single space between them.  Password is your password.  Then when you hit encrypt, it gets a 4-byte salt.  The first two bytes are the most significant two bytes of the double-sha256 of the words input (and used as a checksum to see if the right password was entered on decryption), and the last two bytes of the salt are a random nonce.  Then that password and 4-byte salt are fed used to get a 64 byte scrypt hash with the parameters 16384,8,8 for scrypt.  Then the word list is turned into the hex seed, and the 16 byte hex seed is AES encrypted with the key of the least significant 32 bytes of the scrypt hash.  Then I stick the 4-byte salt in front of the resulting encrypted output, and that total 20 bytes is base58 check-encoded and is the output.\n\nAgain, the encrypt/decrypt process in the exe Windows app can take 10 minutes or more, because I had to use a SLOW pure Python scrypt implementation.

I've ordered a TREZOR and should receive it shortly. However I had a question in regards to the recovery seed. They say:\n\n> Your recovery seed is a sequence of words. It will help you recover your wallet (your Bitcoins and transaction history), into another device should your TREZOR be lost or destroyed.\n\nHow is that secure? Doesn't that mean anyone who gets hold of your words can steal all your Bitcoins? So basically in terms of storage it's as secure as having an encrypted Bitcoin wallet and saving the password by either printing it out or having it on a seperate USB drive?\n\nOr am I missing something?": 1, "Turn off your machine. \n\nI assume you're using something like Windows 7. \n\nYou can use a deleted file recovery tool like Recuva to pull the files off, but you'll need to be careful that you don't overwrite them in the process. This usually means booting from a different hard drive, but if you're gutsy you can do it from this install (not recommended).\n\nWhen you recover the files (you really only need the wallet.dat file, don't worry about the others), be sure not to save them to the original disk - save them to a flash drive or something. Keep the original disk safe until you're completely sure you have the coins.\n\nTime is on your side. Be patient. Be very patient. The data won't be destroyed unless you make a foolish move.

Keep those to the side for now as well, but just be aware that recovering data from encrypted drives is somewhat challenging.": 13, '/u/geckofawkes is incorrect. Formatting does nothing to the existing data on a drive, it only creates a new partition table.

I use a tool called dd or ddrescue for linux, but I know there are other tools (I think I used to use something called ghostery back in the day). \n\nBy working on a clone of your original drive you can guarantee that you'll never be worse off than you are when you start. \n\nI bet you could even take your drive to a trusted computer shop and ask them to clone it for you (don't tell them why) and they shouldn't charge more than $50 for the service.": 2, "It has actually been awhile since I've used Recuva - it is an excellent tool, but I do all of my work in linux now and I just haven't looked at it.

The ways in which it will empower people to weaken government control in their lives, are just as numerous (though probably less obvious) as the ways in which it empowers people to save money in remittances and bank fees.  Decentralization is at the heart of what has always held states at bay.  People may be too brainwashed to be consciously aware of how bitcoin, blockchains, and other decentralizing technologies eliminate the need for government (in many ways such as monetary policy, some law and contract, etc.), but just by building these systems out, people will increasingly be able to simply opt out of centralized (and thus gov\'t controlled or susceptible to gov\'t controlled) services. . . not as an ideological move, but as a convenience or economizing move.  We could, of course, greatly accelerate this process though, if more people applied logic and reason far enough to see the state for the destructive social institution that it is.\n\ntl;dr  you\'re not likely to make any large or lasting change to the worsening police state, without making a fundamental change to the existence of the monopoly government which necessarily produces such outcomes.\n\n/u/changetip 1 mBTC': 7, 'that was kind of you': 2, 'Broke my mouse upvoting so hard.  /u/changetip 50 cents private ': 2, 'Thx!': 1, 'How does using Bitcoin do anything to help that in any way?': 1, 'It\'s just a way, in my opinion, to have more of a voice in our world.
