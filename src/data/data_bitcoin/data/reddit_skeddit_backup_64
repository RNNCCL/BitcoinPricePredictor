Let\'s consider three scenarios:\n\n1. Trusted third party: I send bitcoins to a trusted third party, it waits until shares transferred, then sends bitcoins to seller. This requires two on-chain transaction, say, 300 bytes each, thus 600 bytes total.\n2. 2-of-3 multisig: buyer sends bitcoins to 2-of-3 multisig address, waits for shares to be transferred, then buyer and seller sign a transfer sending bitcoins to seller. Multisig transaction is larger than ordinary, so that would be 500 bytes.\n3. If shares are represented as colored coins, buyer and seller can do atomic trade, that would be 500 bytes.\n\nSo the colored coin option doesn\'t require extra space compared to other realistic scenarios, but it has multiple benefits: 1) no need for a trusted third party; 2) no edge cases or counterparty risk; 3) no need for a separate share registry.\n\nThere\'s no extra burden on the blockchain, and it\'s a case where public blockchain shines, yet people think it\'s abuse, somehow.\n\nFYI banks (who obviously already have all kinds of SQL databases, have trust relationships, etc) are looking how to optimize post-trade settlement using blockchains, as stuff they use now is messy and inefficient. (E.g. see bottom of page 17 and on [here](http://bit.ly/1OW1d0W)). \n\n> Well you can use PGP signatures to create "share certificates". There\'s nothing that says they need to be on the blockchain.\n\nThe question is whether having them on blockchain improves security. And answer is "yes".\n\nThere is a number of possible attack scenarios which can be mitigated by making share registry public i.e. putting it into a blockchain.\n\nIt doesn\'t need to be on the Bitcoin blockchain. If shares don\'t need to be tradeable for bitcoins then there are virtually no benefits of using the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nHowever, I think it would be good for Bitcoin if will be a preferred medium of exchange in some equity markets. At least it makes more sense than using Bitcoin to buy coffee.\n\nYou know, people already figured out how to buy coffee quickly and efficiently without Bitcoin; but private equity transactions are often slow and daunting.': 1, 'Fair enough then.': 1, 'Thank you I will include your suggestions in my research :)': 1, "That's fine. \nI'm hoping to have most of it working this week.\n\nThough I only log into reddit once a week or so.

E.g. we have a bounty program and if you send me a wallet address I can send you 1000 LKK Coins (~15$). \n\nThe cons: still many technical and legal issues to figure out.

Note that just coining the phrase or using it in conversation or print doesn\'t make you the owner of the trademark - it\'s the first use to promote a product or service which counts, as well as its continued use. I\'m sure somebody has written about a "Tesla motor" before, but that doesn\'t invalidate the Tesla trademark for vehicles.\n\nWhen it comes to logos or longer catchphrases, a trademark would also be covered by copyright - but I doubt that the words "Internet of Money" rises above the threshold of being a copyrighted work in its own right.\n\n>Others are then prevented from using it in the exact same way as the company.\n\nOthers are prevented from using it in a way which would confuse the customers of similar categories of products and services, so that the consumer might think that the other company has anything to do with your company.\n\n>By contrast, if they really had invented the phrase and its use and then someone was misrepresenting it, then I believe they could sue.\n\nTrademark protection doesn\'t from the outset ban "incorrect meanings" of trademark beyond who is using it. I guess, though, that you could write licensing terms for a trademark which stipulates that anyone can use the trademark as long as they uses it to mean what you define it to mean. For example, the "Compact Disc" trademark (words and logo) was allowed by its owner to be used on any equipment or optical medium which complied with the CD standard - excluding some copy protected CDs.': 2, '> Establishing the Trademark was in use...\n\nKeep in mind that that doesn\'t just mean that someone *used* that phrase.  "In use" means that it was used in commerce (eg: in a sale) and that the phrase continued to be used in commerce (eg: in ongoing sales).\n\nfrom http://www.traverselegal.com/trademark-attorney/trademark-law/what-constitutes-a-trademark-first-use-in-commerce/:\n\n"The first use in commerce date means a bona fide sale or transportation in commerce which may lawfully be regulated by Congress.  If we break that down into the two important elements, it means that, first, it must be a bona fide sale or transportation for the first use to qualify.  And bona fide means something more than merely a token use.  It\xe2\x80\x99s actually use of the mark in connection with the goods or services for the purpose of making a sale, be it advertising, marketing, whatever it might be.  And then the second element, if it was in fact bona fide, was it followed by activities providing a continuous effort or intent to use the mark.  So, you can\xe2\x80\x99t simply make one sale and then abandon use of the mark moving forward, yet, try and claim rights in it.  You have to continue to have the effort made and intent to use the mark moving forward."\n\n\n': 3, "Thanks for pointing that out.

Thus, a \xe2\x80\x9cprior user\xe2\x80\x9d is a party who began use somewhere or applied for the mark prior to the registrant\xe2\x80\x99s application date. Section 22 of the Act provides that the registration itself creates \xe2\x80\x9cconstructive notice\xe2\x80\x9d of the registrant\xe2\x80\x99s claim of ownership of the mark, thereby precluding anyone else (including a prior user) from claiming good faith, innocent use or expanded use of the same mark after the date of registration, regardless of where the registrant actually uses the mark. These two and other sections of the Trademark Act dictate the scope of a prior user\xe2\x80\x99s rights in a mark registered by another party."\n\n> "A registration less than five years old is not eligible for \xe2\x80\x9cincontestable\xe2\x80\x9d status, but is prima facie evidence of the registrant\xe2\x80\x99s exclusive right to use the mark for the goods or services for which it is registered. Courts differ on the effect of the presumption on the burden of going forward with the evidence and on the burden of proof.\nA prior user can defeat the presumption, however, for any territory in which it can show that it (1) used the mark prior to the registrant\xe2\x80\x99s date of filing and (2) acquired common law rights as a result of its use of the mark prior to the registrant\xe2\x80\x99s use in that territory. Some decisions recognize that the preempted territory also includes the prior user\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9czone of natural expansion.\xe2\x80\x9d Because registration acts as nationwide constructive notice of use of the mark under Section 22, the prior user can establish rights only in those territories in which it was operating prior to the registration date.\nNotably, the prior user\xe2\x80\x99s territory is not frozen as of the earlier \xe2\x80\x9cconstructive use\xe2\x80\x9d date of the filing of the application under Section 7(c), which by its terms does not establish automatic nationwide priority against a party who began use (or applied for a registration) of the mark prior to the registrant\xe2\x80\x99s application date. If the prior user\xe2\x80\x99s priority is based on the fact that it applied for a registration of the mark prior to the registrant\xe2\x80\x99s application date, the prior user is entitled to nationwide priority (assuming it is otherwise entitled to a registration).\nIn addition, regardless of the territorial scope of the prior user\xe2\x80\x99s rights, an unregistered prior user can oppose a junior user\xe2\x80\x99s application for registration and can petition to cancel a junior user\xe2\x80\x99s registration within five years of the date of registration. If such an opposition or petition is successful, and if the successful party has not filed an application to register its mark, the parties\xe2\x80\x99 respective rights will be based solely on their common law rights, based on the priority in which they established their use of the mark in specific territories."': 6, "Doesn't matter.  iPhone -> 1998.": 3, '2010 \xe2\x9c\x94\xef\xb8\x8f [INTERNET OF MONEY - Yoshitaka Fukui, Development Bank of Japan, November 2010](http://www.caad.arch.ethz.ch/noolab/files/external/conferences/IoT2010_proceedings/pdf/OR6/Untangible_Fukui.pdf)': 27, 'you know what they say about any publicity': 5, "That's not how it works.

There is nothing the node does maliciously.": 12, 'ahh.. I see. I was just thinking that advertising nodes would want to entice miners to dedicate download bandwidth to their possibly non-conforming (sybil-attack) blocks by offering coins in escrow for valid blocks on the promise of interest to be deducted from the fees of the relayed blocks.\n\nThis reduces sybil, but does make the node-miner economics more treacherous, as you rightly note.

Many ppl dont know this': 0, "> Doesn't it become a problem when the attack controls 75% of the nodes?\n\nNo, Classic is programmed to diverge from Bitcoin at 75% of *mining* power. Mining power is unrelated to the number of nodes (and also unrelated to the economic support).\n\nA passive Sybil like this will only cause denial of service. Nodes will find it difficult to locate real nodes to communicate with. More evil is possible when the attacker is actually behaving maliciously, especially if the attacker can completely surround your node.\n\nSee: https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Weaknesses#Sybil_attack .
