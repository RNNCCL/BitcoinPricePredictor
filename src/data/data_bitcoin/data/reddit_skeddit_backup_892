But such a path leads to only one place - widespread bans and crackdowns. To back this up, here are some observations of reality; currencies that tried what Peter advocates we try right now:\n\n- eGold. Founders indicted and imprisoned.\n- Liberty Reserve dollars. Founders indicted, most likely to be imprisoned.\n- PayPal. Started out as a strongly libertarian Bitcoin-like payment system:\n\n> "Operating out of Silicon Valley, the idealistic vision of the company was one of a borderless currency, free from governmental controls .... However, PayPal\'s success quickly drew the attention of hackers, scam artists and organized crime groups, who used the service for frauds and money laundering. New security measures stemmed the tide of fraud and customer complaints, but government officials soon stepped in .... Some states, such as Louisiana, banned PayPal from operating in their states altogether."\n\nhttp://money.howstuffworks.com/paypal3.htm\n\nNow very much a part of the establishment.\n\nI could go on, there are others, but I think these three serve to illustrate the purpose.

It\'s just not workable. This is not due to government intervention - it\'s a free market response to abuse of public infrastructure.\n\nI do not believe Bitcoin has a future as being "worse than everything else but with better privacy". That\'s a future that results in the existing companies that are pushing Bitcoin into ordinary everyday lives leaving, only the Silk Road remaining, and either explicit bans or disappearance into obscurity following shortly after. The outcome is useless both to people who care a lot about privacy and people who don\'t. Being decentralised helps a bit but widespread suppression is still possible.

Only Bitcoin will be accepted. \n\nTo begin, let\xe2\x80\x99s examine the mechanics of credit cards and Bitcoin. \n\nCredit Cards are a PULL system\n\nTake a second to think about how a credit card actually works. On this card embossed visibly, is access to your money. When you shop online, you grant access to the vendor - providing Name, Credit Card Number, 3-digit security code, expiration date etc - to buy a $10 t-shirt, and trust that the company will PULL from your account only $10. \n\nYou check your statement every month to ensure that no one has stolen your credit card number and used it without your consent - whether that be a robber, a hacker, or an online merchant. \n\nThe credit card companies internally have an entire fraud department set up to try to detect unapproved activity with your credit card to try to limit the damage. \n\nIf someone has inappropriately PULLED funds from you, you call the credit card company to resolve it and get your money back. The inefficiencies of this system is why credit card companies have to charge merchants a 3% fee for any payments made with a credit card. This 3% is enough at the moment to cover for fraud. \n\nBitcoin is a PUSH system\n\nWhen paying with Bitcoin, rather than giving your account for someone to pull money from, you are actually in control of the funds the entire time and voluntarily push only the amount you want to the merchant. When buying a $10 t-shirt, Bitcoin works by you sending $10 to the online store without anyone other than yourself having access to your money. It is similar to how the recipient of an email you send has no access to your email account. They only receive the particular email you sent them. \n\nDue to this, there are no problems with chargebacks and no fraudulent expenses that the network has to deal with. As such, over 80,000 merchants have accepted Bitcoin as a form of payment online, including notably the 6 billion dollar sized companies: Expedia, Tiger Direct, Dell, Overstock, Newegg, DISH. \n\nAwesome. Now there\xe2\x80\x99s 2 choices for the consumer right? \n\nNo. This current state is only temporary. \n\nAs the amount of online spending conducted with Bitcoin increases, credit card companies will not only be unable to compete with the 0 transaction cost of Bitcoin through cutting fees, they will actually be forced to increase the fees they charge merchants from 3% to 4% to 5%, and higher until merchants no longer even desire to offer the ability to pay by credit card and consumers no longer want to own a credit card due to the fees associated with owning one and lack of ubiquity to spend with it online. \n\nWhy?\n\nSuppose fraudulent credit card spending is currently 1% of all transactions. Credit card companies at present charge a 3% processing fee and are still able to make a profit. They reasonably could even cut fees to 2%, decrease their margins and try to remain competitive with Bitcoin. Merchants may be excited by this development. This is not sustainable however. \n\nThe truth is that as Bitcoin is used more often online, there are more and more legitimate \xe2\x80\x98Good\xe2\x80\x99 transactions being taken away from the total pool of commerce conducted on credit cards. All business done with Bitcoin that could have otherwise been done with a credit card is legitimate because the consumer is trying to protect his or her privacy and is not using Bitcoin over credit cards to commit fraud. If I am a fraudster however, and I have someone else\xe2\x80\x99s credit card number, I will continue to use it. \n\nThe resulting effect is that the % of fraud transactions for credit card companies will rise from the existing hypothetical 1% to 2% to 3% to 4% as more consumers use Bitcoin. At that point, even if credit card companies wanted to offer a lower rate for online merchants, they would not be able to. \n\nIn fact, credit card companies will have to raise rates. Merchants then will be faced with paying an ever higher % of their revenue to credit card companies. This will lead to merchants dropping off credit card acceptance - further accelerating the adoption of Bitcoin. As a result, there will come a point where there will be more merchants that accept Bitcoin than merchants who accept credit cards. \n\nBitcoin is not an additional choice for consumers to use for shopping online.

It's used widely by anarchists, autrian economists, chicago economists, libertarians, green-backers, constitutionalists, communists, and other counter-cultural groups I interact with regularly, but is apparently not a distinction made in mainstream usage.\n\nEdit: There are apparently several different distinctions made between 'credit' and 'loan' by a range of different organisations. For example some banks make this distinction: https://www.wellsfargo.com/personal_credit/products/line_loan\n\nThis theory uses it similarly to how I used it: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_theory_of_money": 2, "Why keep money in my wallet when the market fluctuates so much?

Unlike most bitcoin videos, your \'under the hood\' video hits almost every aspect and goes a littlebit more deeper into explaining all the aspects of bitcoin, that\'ll leave the viewers with a better understanding and lesser questions than all the others. This new one is great also and I share it when someone ask me for information about bitcoin. Because you want some feedback, here I have some.\n\nThe first is not just for your videos, but for all educational videos and/or presentations. Of a 40 minute presentation, a listener will only remember 10 minutes of it because they got bombed with all the new information the brain needs to absorb. Ive learned this when I had to give some collages in classes. To reflect it to your video, I had to watch your \'under the hood\' video 3-4 times to absorb all the information. The shorter the video, the better. The longer the video, the less people will remember about it. But because bitcoin is such a big thing, its impossible to make it a 5 minutes full explaining video. In fact the biggest problem with the majority of the bitcoin videos out there, is that they all want to be a short ELI5 video about the whole thing. Resulting in several short bitcoin videos that became nothing more than copies of each other with a different simulation and explained in the end nothing at all. \n\nMy suggestion is to have one overall ELI5 video (In your case this video) and several other short videos, explaining just one little aspect about bitcoin each from ELI5 to a deep technical level. In youtube, you can link videos to each other. "want to know more about public/private keys? klick here", "Understanding what the blockchain is and how it works? click here". This way people can choose what they want to know more about and are able to manage their 10 of 40 minutes to their own needs. I\'m gonna us this method with some friends to create short explaining minecraft videos (just for fun). I and a lot of other people get annoyed that they\'ll have to watch a 15-30 minute video of BS while they only needed 1.5 minutes of information of it explaining how to build that little redstone connection.\n\nI hope this helped a little and I would like to see more from you.

It is a prize, presented at the same ceremony, in memorial to Nobel. This kind of bolt-on award process happens all of the time and always carries far less weight than the rest of the proceedings.

There is no denying that or how lucrative OS can be.

Your rhetoric is all we have to work with, and if you and your team are trying to recruit developers, it\'s important you look around and take stock of your motives and how others experience them. From the OP, at least in my experience, it would seem that it is in large part about the money (as you have now explicitly backed the position; it is probably the case that this is not true, but the OP does not express that). Sure the OP wants to "learn" and build a "legacy" for himself but it seemed like a side note next to all the money making opportunities. \n\nAnd that\'s fine, you are welcome to make money! In fact, that\'s what most people are in this subreddit to do. We all need to put food on the table. Anyone who is exclusively in it for the ideology would probably be anonymous.\n\nBut what does making money and gaining notoriety mean exactly, especially when you can\'t really promise those things? Not much, if you ask me. In fact, if you are trying to make a promise you can\'t back with a guarantee, my alarm bells start ringing. Questions I begin to ask myself: why would someone make that promise? What\'s their motive? Is it self interest? Ideological? Naivete? A combination of all of the above?\n\nYou reinforce my concerns with this point:\n\n>My belief is that in the future, looking back at the debate over the formation of decentralized markets it will be strange to even comprehend. Of course people should be able to sell things to each other directly! It\'s as fundamental a human interaction as anything else we do.\n\nOf course p2p trade is a low level human interaction, no one is going to debate that! Why do you feel the need to even make that claim? It happens all day every day. You guys aren\'t the first to attempt it, and it\'s already possible on the internet (albeit via centralized platforms). One example would be Craigslist. Sure it can be censored and it doesn\'t have WoT and Ricardian Contracts, but CL doesn\'t take a cut and you can trade just about anything on there these days. Any "plugins" you add to OB that don\'t require the p2p protocol, you can be sure will be added to a comparatively similar, yet centralized marketplace. \n\nSo here we are, looking at what you can do on OB that you can\'t do on CL or a similarly capable centralized marketplace. Illegality immediately comes to mind, which is where my concerns around recruiting developers comes to a head. Why should they work on your platform instead of building a centralized one that does the exact same thing which can avoid all the cp? _This_ is the question you need to answer, which in my opinion, you have not yet fully answered. If the answer is to avoid censorship (ideological) that\'s fine!

Between 2000 EUR and 15000 EUR this machine will ask you for a fingerprint. WE DO NOT STORE YOUR FINGERPRINT. Instead, we select 21 random reading points that will allow us to verify the finger as being 'the same person' but we do not know who this person is, just that it is 'the same person'. By doing this we can lift the limits on hourly usage so these units can process far more transactions / hour and still comply with local laws.\n\nBitcoin ATM units in the MrBitcoin network are usually capped to 15k EUR / day transactions as any cash purchase above 15k EUR will require a ID verification and mandatory reporting. This has nothing to do with Bitcoin but everything to do with the law that states that ANY cash transactions above 15.000 EUR have to be reported, Bitcoin or not. This is also the reason behind the 15k EUR limit on some of our ATM units. By asking for an ID we can have users 'unlock' the machine to lift these limits and buy / sell enough coins to say, purchase a car.\n\nWe feel that this is the way we can best conform to local laws and not impose a restrictive regime like other ATM operators. By adding some voluntary verification in Bitcoin ATM units that support it we can lift some of the restrictions local laws put on us. In no way do we ask for identification upfront and always give the user the option to use the machine anonymously (and have in our opinion very relaxed limit imposed) or unlock the machine to its full potential by providing us with some sort of verification.\n\nWhat do you guys think?

But long term I don\'t think any Apple product can impact Bitcoin because they are in two completely different categories.  Bitcoin is about much more than fees and convenience.  Bitcoin is money that works on the internet, the same for every human.  Apple is a company selling a product.  The proposed product will bear much more resemblance to a bank account or a paypal app than it will to Bitcoin.  \n\nLong term, in my opinion, the fundamental question about payment solutions on the internet is "is it money"?\n\nMoney is independently verifiable.  Payments made with money cannot be stopped or reversed by a third party.  Money works regardless of the identity of the person holding it.  Money cannot be arbitrarily created out of nothing.\n\nBitcoin has all of these features.  Payment solutions controlled by companies do not, and by their very nature, cannot.  \n\nAdults today are not yet used to thinking of money on the internet in this way.  The shift will likely be a generational one.  Today\'s college entrepreneurs will be using Bitcoin to build applications, since they don\'t need anyone\'s permission to do so, whereas all payment solutions controlled by a company require permission and come with restrictions.  Teenagers will be introduced to Bitcoin by their siblings in college and the applications they create.  They will realize that Bitcoin can do anything money can do, and the Apple/Google/Paypal products cannot.  Their siblings in middle school will realize that they too can use Bitcoin, at will, and they cannot be excluded.  They will lose patience with other payment \'solutions\' that require jumping through hoops and only work in some places for some people.  Why would you accept restrictions if you don\'t have to?  These kids will grow up, and the advantages of actual money on the internet will be obvious to them since they are less biased against new ways of thinking than those who grew up in a world where credit cards were the only option and internet transactions were identity based.\n\nBecause Bitcoin is not a company, it does not compete.  It simply exists, and people can choose to use it for it\'s useful features if they want to.  It seems clear to me that Bitcoin has useful features that cannot be offered by any company and therefore it will be used by those who want money that works online.

The whole key to having direct control over money depends on everyone not having direct access to money, for money to only exist within the closed banking system. This is already what gives them control over the currency and the ability to redistribute wealth. If we get rid of the ~3% of the money supply that is physical, and go digital only, then their control is absolute. Bitcoin breaks the whole closed system by allowing digital money to exist objectively, outside of the banking network.

(EDIT: and I am even going to cut this rambling comment off where it stands as I have expended far too much time and energy on this issue. This topic seems to require _far_ too much text relative to the simple concept in play and I have neither the time or inclination to either fill the content out to help move people's minds through it or to trim it down to more effectively deliver the message I've been working on thus far. Either way, it's just not happening. It is frankly not a good use of my time.)\n\nBefore you press the return key on your finex sell order you are not providing liquidity because you have not yet done anything. That much I hope is clear enough.\n\nOnce you press the return key you still have not provided liquidity. You will have, in fact, just _removed_ liquidity from the market, at least momentarily until (and if and only if) someone backfills for the order you just took.\n\nYour BTC-e sell wall is providing liquidity because the order could be taken at any moment by someone willing to buy that far into to the book. Just because you intend to pull it doesn't mean it isn't there to be taken.\n\nYour Coinbase buy is more complex, given their nature and that of their relationships to the various exchanges. That said, your buy there is effectively the same as your finex sell. Before you hit the return key you have no relation to liquidity one way or the other. Once you hit the return key you take some liquidity out of the market. In the finex sell case, you slightly reduced the bid-side liquidity, increasing the spread and slippage for others who would sell just after you. In the Coinbase buy case, and this is where their obscured workings make things difficult, but the overall net effect should be reasonably similar, you slightly reduced their ask-side liquidity, increasing the spread and the slippage for others who would buy just after you. Coinbase would backfill for this in a manner not dissimilar to how another exchange user might fill in the gap you just created in the book, but in Coinbase's case they might, as but one off-hand example, place a market order on an exchange of their choice, in turn slightly (and momentarily) reducing the exchange ask-side liquidity in order to, once withdrawn to Coinbase, be made available to increase the Coinbase ask-side liquidity.\n\nLiquidity is not granted to the market from what you've already taken from the market. Or from what you could provide to or take from the market in the future. Liquidity is also not negated because you have something on offer that you intend to soon remove. Liquidity is provided by what is currently on offer, in other words it is provided by and only by _that which can presently be acted against_. Whenever someone talks about liquidity coming from something that cannot presently be acted against they are not actually talking about liquidity. They might well be talking about some other valuable and important thing but it would not be liquidity. If it is available on the market right now then it provides liquidity. That said, the quality and/or degree of said liquidity for that offer and for the market as a whole, which is where things become truly important as it is the markets quality/degree of liquidity which truly matters, depends on more than just something being on offer. The spread matters. The depth adjacent that spread matters.\n\nIf I want to place an x USD or x BTC order to take liquidity from the market, and if doing so will incur y% slippage, and if y% slippage is too high for my needs, then the market is illiquid for my needs. If people's _general_ values for x produce a value for y which they agree is _generally_ too high then the market will be _generally_ considered illiquid. If, on the other hand, y is reasonable then the market will be generally considered liquid. Either way, it all comes down to what is available to be taken from the market. If it isn't on the market and available for the taking _right now_ then it isn't providing liquidity. And if there isn't enough liquidity near enough to the spot price then the market can still be considered illiquid. And, even if there is plenty available for the taking on both sides immediately adjacent to the spot price, there will be those who feel a market is still illiquid if those offers aren't being taken and back-filled with regularity, as they will require that a market have liquidity both provided and taken in order to consider the market liquid as a whole.\n\nIn any case, BTC or USD or whatever sitting off to the sides isn't doing anything for liquidity.

From the font of all knowledge:\n\n"market liquidity is a market\'s ability to facilitate an asset being sold quickly without having to reduce its price very much (or even at all). Equivalently, an asset\'s market liquidity (or simply "an asset\'s liquidity") is the asset\'s ability to sell quickly without having to reduce its price very much. Liquidity is about how big the trade-off is between the speed of the sale and the price it can be sold for. In a liquid market, the trade-off is mild: selling quickly will not reduce the price much. In a relatively illiquid market, selling it quickly will require cutting its price by some amount." (Wikipedia)\n\nExample one: Yes, you are providing liquidity, but it\'s hidden. It\'s in the "dark pool", in a way, but you didn\'t pay the extra fee to Bitfinex to hide it. You quickly click return, selling your asset, when needed. \n\nExample two: If you have no intention of selling, does that mean you\'ll drop the wall if the price hits it? If so, then no, you aren\'t providing liquidity. I\'m not an economist, but doesn\'t the idea of a sell wall go against this definition of liquidity anyway? Now, a buy wall, on the other hand...\n\nExample three: You are not providing liquidity, at least right now.

Given a supply of roughly 2M BTC at the time, that means that fully *1/2% of the entire monetary base of Bitcoin* had to be acquired and exchanged in order to move one pizza\'s worth of value through the economy. Realistically, there was not enough "liquidity" in the entire economy to even facilitate pizza transfers as there were only 200 pizzas worth of value in the entire economy (I\'m using the word "liquidity" because you won\'t tell me your preferred term for the phenomenon I wish to discuss). And please don\'t deride my example as absurd, since it is in fact a real world example. \n\nToday there is enough "liquidity" to facilitate pizza transfers, primarily because investors have moved value into the economy. But there is not yet enough "liquidity" to facilitate remittance, as moving that amount of value through the economy would definitely affect the price of the currency. We need more investors to move more value into the economy, raising the "liquidity" so that large movements of value will not disrupt the price.  When that happens, Bitcoins utility (problem solving ability) will be even higher. \n\nThat is my point.\n\nPlease realize that IME there are different meanings for the word liquidity.  I can talk about the liquidity of a given exchange, which refers to the depth of order books and velocity of transfers which IMO is more or less your definition.  I can talk about the liquidity of a business, which is the ability of that business to raise ready cash relative to its other illiquid assets. And there\'s the liquidity of an entire economy, which is the relative ability of that economy to facilitate transfers without moving the price of the currency. This involves all markets for the currency, including all points of exchange in the economy from local brokers to worldwide exchanges to pizza salesmen who trade pizza for currency. Anyone who trades an item of value (USD, EURO, pizzas, cars) for the currency increases its "liquidity" (ability to transfer value without moving the price) by adding value to it. \n\nThe last definition is the one I\'m using, and I\'ll be happy to stop using it the instant you give me a more appropriate word.': 2, "95% hold, 5% spend with instant buyback, that's me.": 12, 'And the guys who did just that during the price crash from 260 to 55 usd back in April-November 2013 became stinking rich. :)': 2, 'Liquidity is part of it.

Doing the same with the low-balls on the bid side would surely help in its own ways too.\n\n(Then you might also be able to talk about the myriad of other factors which might interplay with one another, both driving and being driven by an increase in the exchange rate, but _in context of one another_, not in the "all other things being equal" tone of some of the comments I\'ve seen to this post.)\n\nPerhaps talk about only putting on the books what and where you intend to sell or buy, discouraging "walls" and such, as an element in encouraging perhaps more natural price discovery.\n\nThe list could go on for ages, I\'m sure, but it\'s not my list to build and the things I\'ve mentioned above are just random things that popped into my head, not some kind of reasoned list which I feel must hold merit.\n\n(Most of things I listed, and to be extremely clear, would cause a near-term _reduction_ of liquidity but they could be argued as net-beneficial effects from holding.)': 1, "> If their coins aren't in the order book, contributing depth near the spot price, they are most definitely not adding liquidity.\n\nThis is clearly your thesis. \n\nMay I challenge it with some questions? \n\n**Example one:**\n\nI'm ready to sell 1000 btc right this second on bitfinex.

Nonsense, our blockchain is linearly larger than Bitcoin\'s, which is a trade-off effect of providing cryptographically unlinkable and untraceable transactions. Nonetheless, even if we match Bitcoin\'s transaction volume in a few years we will still have a blockchain that comfortably fits on consumer-grade storage.\n\n5.

We have since provided an additional patch that lets clients stuck on the dead side of the fork recover without needing to sync from scratch. We did this without needing to do any rollback.\n\n6.

(This is just one example and something people \nwould be more likely to relate to than something criminal)\n\nI analyze two scenarios, Figure A and Figure B. The second scenario being an improvement on the first, with the first illustrating why you would want an improvement.\n\nFigure A, doing this using a one cryptocurrency exchange website\n\n1) obtain bitcoin -> 2) buy monero on exchange -> 3) send monero to your account -> (optional) 4) send monero back to exchange -> (optional)  5) buy bitcoin\n\nMonero is a cryptocurrency built on the cryptonote protocol (no bitcoin-core here, unlike other "altcoins"), the entire network is behind stealth addresses and every transaction uses ring signatures from other stealthed addresses so nobody know the recipient or sender and addresses and there are no addresses to look at in the blockchain because all transactions only have stealth addresses in them. Needless to say, this is all decentralized, compared to a solution like DarkWallet by UnSystem which can use stealth addresses for Bitcoin and mixing but relies on a server for the mixing. And stealth addresses in a system where others addresses are public has a weak link in those public addresses. And confirmation times with Monero are faster than bitcoin, so any bitcoin mixing service to unlink transactions will be a lot slower. Allow me to reiterate that Monero does not use mixing.\n\nLets analyze figure A. In steps 1, 2, and 3 the cryptocurrency exchange has a record of your addresses (and Monero\'s payment IDs), in theory this exchange could be subpoena\'d to at least see that there was a payment ID and a certain amount sent. Might possibly be useful for reasonable suspicion if there was already a suspect and authorities needed a warrant to confirm that suspect\'s wallet or service had a matching payment ID for an old transaction (since you wouldn\'t be able to determine this in Monero\'s blockchain)\n\nSteps 4) and 5) assume you even want bitcoin. There are more bitcoin goods and services than there are for Monero, so this is plausible. There are Monero gambling services, for instance. The cryptocurrency project is about the financial privacy non-bitcoiners can relate to already, but in a trustless way. For someone simply wanting to unlink transactions, going back to bitcoin at all is actually redundant whether you want to hear it or not, or are apprehensive about someone trying to "pump an altcoin". This is the utility, and the cryptonote protocol might not have some of the utility that the bitcoin protocol has, so consider that the objective analysis.\n\nSo lets look at Figure B, doing this with two cryptocurrency exchange websites\n\n1) obtain bitcoin -> 2) buy monero on exchange -> 3) send monero to your account -> 4) send monero to **DIFFERENT** address or (optionally) exchange -> (optional)  5) buy bitcoin\n\nstep 4 is now no longer optional and simply now introduces the possibility that two exchanges would need to be subpoena\'d to ATTEMPT to track the funds, increasingly unlikely but perhaps all monero exchanges would be subpoena\'d at once for particular payment IDs. But here is where things get interesting. The first exchange had Monero sent to an unknown address. The second exchange had Monero received from an equally indistinct unknown address. Transactions in the blockchain show payment IDs and amounts, so you would want to do this in at least two transactions (not sure if the Monero client does this for you, I forget, it is a VERY opaque blockchain).\n\nAgain though, even if your Monero account was inspected under a warrant and reasonable suspicion because of step 3. Step 4 allows you to maintain plausible deniability about controlling the funds. Any transaction from your account whether it is to a different account you control or to an exchange is indistinct. If you sent it to an exchange there is just that POSSIBLE weak link that the exchange\'s database is inspected by authorities for a matching payment ID in the past, to relink the funds. If you sent it to a different address that wasn\'t for a good or service then this would never happen. But after wards those funds are equally as fungible or liquid.\n\n( /u/fluffyponyza thoughts on this method for unlinking transactions? made some assumptions about subpeona\'s, plausible deniability and neglected viewkeys because I\'ve never used them and I\'m not sure what would be revealed in them if someone were coerced into revealing one to authorities)': 9, "yeah so it doesn't matter where the person or company is\n\nthe datacenter will image the server instance (containing the site, database of all addresses, all correspondence, chat logs, email addresses, passwords, 2FA recovery tokens) for whatever authority and the exchange/gambling site won't even know": 3, 'I would strongly disagree.
