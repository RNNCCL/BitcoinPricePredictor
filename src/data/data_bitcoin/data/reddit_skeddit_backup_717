I\'ve been a bit of an insider in Estonian politics for the past 2 years or so. It\'s not so much the politicians that are the problem. Infotech issues haven\'t been politicized. Political decisions are mostly of sufficient quality. The problem on the legislative/executive level is just lack of knowledge. Which can be fixed quite easily. Estonia is a tiny place and going for a beer with your representative can be arranged within days.\n\nThe real issue is with the police, state prosecutor\'s office, and the judicial branch. Which all, more or less, operate independently from political control and oversight. They\'ve become a state within a state. Quite often on Facebook stories are shared, long descriptions of complete miscarriages of justice. These don\'t end up in the newspapers, because the newspapers rely on sources within the police, the state prosecutor\'s office, the judicial branch, and even in the spy agencies to get their stories. So they don\'t expose the corruption, because they depend on this corruption for easy headlines. And there is not enough money for independently-researched in-depth investigative journalism.\n\nLast guy that tried to take some babysteps towards reforming this state-within-a-state was the minister of justice two years ago. The state prosecutor ran wild, overstepping most legal boundaries you can think of. Found exactly zero evidence for any crime, but spread enough rumours that the guy was forced to resign.\n\nLast year an ex-member of our supreme court stepped up and said publicly that our judicial and prosecutorial system is corrupt to the bone. The news story disappeared off the net in a matter of hours.\n\nThis bitcoin case is just another symptom of a corrupt system full of mutually loyal incompetent assholes wasting taxpayer money on complete bullshit just so they don\'t ever have to admit being wrong.\n\nI\'ve had several lawyers tell me in private conversations how important it is that you never criticize a judge, how the prosecutor will often leak even blatantly false information to the press, but they can\'t say anything publicly, because then they wouldn\'t be able to practice law in Estonia anymore. Most judges would automatically rule against them in retaliation.\n\nEarlier this year a guy who\'s "in" with this system publicly threatened to kill me. Multiple credible witnesses. And death threats are a criminal offense in Estonia. I reported this to the police. Zero investigation. Just got a letter saying "this is not a crime". While it is. I complained to the district prosecutor. "Not a crime." I complained to the state prosecutor. "Not a crime." I hired a lawyer and complained to the judge. "Not a crime." Completely ignoring all references to previous (supreme) court cases where the exact same thing had been determined to be a crime. None of these people ever expressed any doubt in my version of the story. My favorite response was from the state prosecutor who basically wrote: "Yeah, death threats is just how that guy communicates. Don\'t take it too seriously."\n\nIt\'s a banana republic over here.

Be ready for the most absurd and illogical interpretations of the law.\n\nOoh, this reminds me. End of 2011, our group, which later morphed into ISOC Estonia, was contacted by the ministry of justice to get our comments on a proposed law change. The change would have allowed the police to make single queries about the location of a phone in the context of a criminal investigation into its theft. (Previously this right would have been present only when the value of the phone exceeded a certain rather high amount.) That was the clearly defined goal. I was in charge of writing our reply to the ministry's request for comments. With smartphones costing as much as a laptop computer and a big part of people's lives being on their phones, I wrote and sent our approval. Law got changed. Changes went into effect.\n\nThen a news story crops up. Some woman (who later turned out to be the sister of someone I knew) had her phone stolen from the counter while working in a store. She went to the police. First they tried to dissuade her from writing a crime report. Like, almost verbal abuse at the front desk. She persisted. Then they told her that they have no legal power to track a stolen phone's location, because that would infringe on the human rights of the criminal. That's bullshit. I was there when they crafted the law, which gave them that power.\n\nSo I wrote an article explaining how the law had come into being, what it said in the law, what it said in the comments that came with the law, etc. Sent it off to some publications. The reply I got was, well, that's interesting, but we talked to the police and they said you're wrong, so we won't be running your story.\n\nSome time later another thing happened. My female friend was harassed by his boyfriend. Bit of a history of domestic abuse and a generally messy relationship, which, thankfully, ended. So the guy being savvy with computers, installs a keylogger on her laptop, logs into all her online accounts, deletes everything. Including important work emails and such. Doesn't use a VPN, leaves clear evidence that it was him, she gets the logs from Google, sends it to the police. He confesses to the crime over SMS. She takes that to the police. A year goes by. Nothing is done. The SMS was even refused to be taken into evidence. This is as clear cut a case of hacking as it gets. With a confession. Nothing happens for a year.\n\nI think it was last month or the month before that the chief of police came out and openly admitted that they don't have the resources to investigate all crimes, so they don't. They just log that it happened and wait for the statute of limitations.\n\nMeanwhile some enforcement areas (money laundering, cannabis homegrows, tax office) are so massively overfunded that they start harassing innocent people to get their numbers up and keep the cash coming in.": 1, '> The attacker claimed that he was in his kitchen and had forgotten to put the knives down when he went outside.\n\nROFL.': 4, '1FoaZ26sz9EmPZcEaSNDnww2gzW3MiLivD Is this definatley the right address to donate for the legal fund to?

This has been a dream of the Bitcoin faithful for some time; now, the technology is showing signs of evolving to support the ambitions.\n\nThe hopes rest on the adaptability of the blockchain, the distributed, public ledger where all Bitcoin transactions are recorded. This is one of the main innovations that have fed hopes that the ideas behind the digital currency make it more than just a haven for speculators, drug dealers and crypto-anarchists.\n\nEssentially, the blockchain provides a way to transfer value between two people online without the need for any central authority to validate the transaction. When a bitcoin is bought and sold, both parties can be certain the digital bits have been transferred and can\xe2\x80\x99t be copied or replicated elsewhere.\n\nBringing that kind of certainty to peer-to-peer activities in a distributed digital marketplace is quite a feat. Imagine what it could do to buying and selling tokens that represent other assets, such as shares or houses. The potential uses are limited only by the imagination \xe2\x80\x94 and the tech entrepreneurs being drawn to Bitcoin have plenty of that.\nRather than representing just digital assets, for instance, entries in the blockchain could represent \xe2\x80\x9cvirtual\xe2\x80\x9d keys that could be used to claim ownership of physical assets, such as cars, or to verify identity. From passports to wills to patents, the theoretical uses seem limitless.\nReality, however, has been slow to catch up. Bobby Goodlatte, an angel investor in Silicon Valley who has backed two Bitcoin companies, sums up the current state of the art: \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s really early, and a lot of stuff has been over-promised.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAdam Shapiro, of Promontory Financial Group, adds that separating the blockchain from its Bitcoin roots will not be simple. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s become fashionable for people to talk about being a fan of the blockchain and not of Bitcoin,\xe2\x80\x9d he says, but because they involve a transfer of value, all the potential uses are Bitcoin-like to some degree and so \xe2\x80\x9cat least a little bit financial services\xe2\x80\x9d.\n\nFrom registrars to escrow agents \xe2\x80\x94 the world would never be the same again\n\nThe blockchain was not developed with other digital assets or \xe2\x80\x9csmart contracts\xe2\x80\x9d in mind and building on top of it causes other problems, says Adam Back, a British developer who came up with a key piece of the Bitcoin infrastructure. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a little bit of a hack, really,\xe2\x80\x9d he says of attempts to adapt the technology.\n\nOne response has been the creation of alternative blockchains. One of the most ambitious projects, Ethereum, hopes to launch a network soon for contracts based on its own unit of currency, known as ether. But ideas like this involve starting afresh, making them all-or-nothing bets that don\xe2\x80\x99t draw on the headway already made by Bitcoin.\nThe latest buzz to spread through the cyber currency world involves \xe2\x80\x9csidechains\xe2\x80\x9d, or ledgers designed with specific purposes in mind \xe2\x80\x94 a market for trading equities, for instance \xe2\x80\x94 that are still \xe2\x80\x9cpegged\xe2\x80\x9d to Bitcoin, rather than requiring the creation of an entirely new currency. If it works, this would keep the network effects of being part of the Bitcoin world while freeing developers to come up with new models for cyber-transactions.\n\nBlockstream, the company that Mr Back and a handful of other prominent Bitcoin developers have set up to create this infrastructure, raised more than $20m last month from luminaries such as Reid Hoffman of LinkedIn and Eric Schmidt of Google. That is a colossal amount for an initial seed round of financing, and a sign of the high hopes.\nIn the longer term, says Mr Back, shares or other forms of property could be issued directly through a sidechain, as well as being bought and sold that way. For all the intermediaries involved in those markets \xe2\x80\x94 from the registrars to the brokers and escrow agents \xe2\x80\x94 the world would never be the same again.\n\nThe potent technology of Bitcoin has always made it a good place for dreamers, and version 2.0 raises even more disruptive possibilities than its predecessor. The implications for a wide range of online interactions are intriguing \xe2\x80\x94 just as long as it can survive the inevitable hype.\n\nrichard.waters@ft.com ': 6, "Surprisingly good write-up.

It is trivially easy to load unsigned code and applications on the device, but they will not execute. However, restricting every single application to only running signed code has performance implications for javascript.\n\nJavascript performance is a major aspect of the iPhone (or any web-intensive device), and as such uses what is known as "Just-In-Time" dynamic compilation to accelerate performance. What this means is that the phone will turn javascript into native machine code so that it runs faster when you load a web page.\n\nThe catch is that this "JIT" code is not signed - it\'s created by your phone, not by Apple. The iPhone firmware can be told that certain applications have the signing restrictions disabled - Safari for example, is one of them. However, the firmware will only allow this feature on an application which is itself signed by Apple, and Apple doesn\'t sign any 3rd-party applications with this dynamic-compilation flag.\n\nApple doesn\'t "let" people jailbreak their phones. Jailbreakers find bugs which allow them to disable the code-signing checks for the jailbroken applications on the device. And every time, Apple fixes the bugs. Each time you hear about a new firmware version being "Jailbroken", that means that Jailbreakers have been able to find 6-10+ *new* bugs which allowed them to disable signing every time the phone boots up.\n\nAnd that\'s not to say that Apple writes buggier-than-average software-- Any piece of software that complex will have lots of bugs.

This processor always runs a proprietary operating system, and these systems are known to have backdoors that make it possible to remotely convert the modem into a remote spying device. The spying can involve activating the device's microphone, but it could also use the precise GPS location of the device and access the camera, as well as the user data stored on the phone. Moreover, modems are connected most of the time to the operator's network, making the backdoors nearly always accessible.\n>\n> It is possible to build a device that isolates the modem from the rest of the phone, so it can't mess with the main processor or access other components such as the camera or the GPS. Very few devices offer such guarantees. In most devices, for all we know, the modem may have total control over the applications processor and the system, but that's nothing new.\n>\n> While working on Replicant, a fully free/libre version of Android, we discovered that the proprietary program running on the applications processor in charge of handling the communication protocol with the modem actually implements a backdoor that lets the modem perform remote file I/O operations on the file system. This program is shipped with the Samsung Galaxy devices and makes it possible for the modem to read, write, and delete files on the phone's storage. On several phone models, this program runs with sufficient rights to access and modify the user's personal data. A technical description of the issue, as well as the list of known affected devices is available at the Replicant wiki.\n\nhttps://www.fsf.org/blogs/community/replicant-developers-find-and-close-samsung-galaxy-backdoor\n\nThis is, in all seriousness, why I warn people of the danger that Bitcoin was created by the global spy cartel.

Game theory suggests the NSA must launch the currency first to get the network effects, if it fails they lose nothing. But if it works...

Trust me, its 100% better than going to a WU in which you have to fill out forms, wait in lines, etc. etc. Hope it helps.": 1, "Yeah. Bitcoin isn't helpful at all if the people they are sending the money back home to cannot convert it to quetzales.": 1, 'Guatemalan here, I started experimenting with bitcoin this year and so far have really enjoyed the learning process and loved the thrill of being able to play and convert US$ to BTC. I\'m an entrepreneur and have several small clients all over Central America which send me money via WU and Moneygram. I absolutely despise WU and honestly not so much Moneygram but would love to be able to receive money via BTC. Bitcoin in my country faces several problems wich I\'ll try to address over here and please give me your feedback.\n\nBuying & Selling Coins\nI tried local BTC exchanges and although I found a couple of people buying and selling coins the prices in which they sold bitcoin were much higher than the market value. I was finally able to buy bitcoin through my Mastercard (ironic right?) through Cirlcle.com . So now I have an online wallet with little money in it and the first experiment I wanted to make is how can I convert BTC back to US$ (forget about the Guatemalan Quetzal), US$ are plenty good over here and I figured out I would loose less money by converting to US$ than to Quetzales.\n\nWhen I tried to convert BTC back to US$ to deposit back to my credit card guess what I found? The transfer from circle.com did go through but I never received the funds back in to my credit card! So the money was misteriously lost for ever. Honestly I do trust Circle and I guess that the money is now in some sort of limbo in my bank. This experiment didn\'t affect me as I approached it as if I had gone gambling to Vegas and was prepared to loose money while experimenting. \n\nSo the problem right now at least in Central American countries like mine is that, sure people would love not going to WU and automatically having money in their wallet, but what good is having US$5000 worth of bitcoin in a wallet if you can\'t cash it in. I haven\'t found one retailer over here that accepts Bitcoin. There are a couple of hostels run by expats that I know do accept btc. The situation a little bit like that old movie "Alive" from 1993 where the rugby team crashes in the Andes and one guy says to the other: ["Hey I\'ll pay for pizza if you go get it."](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0106246/quotes), money is no good if you can\'t spend it. \n\n\nPrice Fluctuation\nI\'ve been monitoring the price of BTC and the problem is that right now it\'s too volatile, and in a country where minimum wage is about US$300 , not receiving a couple of dollars in your transaction can become a problem for most people.\n\nMoney & Tax Laws\nI imagine that there shouldn\'t be a problem with sending a couple houndred dollars worth of bitcoin the same as it isn\'t a problem sending that ammount via WU, but if you try to "cash in"  several thousand dollars or more and inject it into a bank account you would definetly raise several red flags and you might get yourselv in trouble. Since our country is affected by drug smuglers and drug cartels lawmakers and banks keep a close eye to cash transactions and cash origins. I imagine that this applies to most countries now a days but you really really don\'t want to get in trouble over here by accidentally comitting a financial crime. At one time I was looking at the possibility of buying an bitcoin ATM to put in touristy locations and after a quick chat with a lawyer I wouldn\'t touch a BTC ATM over here with a 10 foot pole!\n\nI don\'t want to come like I\'m not in favor of Bitcoin, because trust me I really am.
