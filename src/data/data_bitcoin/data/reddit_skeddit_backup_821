I\'ve found for a while that I can\'t even relate to anyone here on /r/bitcoin anymore. 18 months ago when I started checking out /r/bitcoin there were some interesting articles and viewpoints with some good discussion by like-minded users and now it just seems overrun with libertarians and bitcoin fanatics who cant find 1 second to step back and consider an opposing view. The community needs to do an ego check and come back down to earth if they want to help adoption. /r/buttcoin and even /r/bitcoinmarkets are good at doing this. This community is self destructing because every time a new person comes in and sees the front page of /r/bitcoin they roll their eyes at all the crazy crap on here and they\'re turned off of bitcoin. But its fine because I don\'t care if bitcoin becomes a common method of payment or not. It\'s cool but seems pretty useless for micropayments at POS terminals which is where I spend 90% of my money. Now I only trade bitcoin for investment purposes and will likely never use it again for anything else.': 2, "Thanks.. for the extra 'keywords'...
