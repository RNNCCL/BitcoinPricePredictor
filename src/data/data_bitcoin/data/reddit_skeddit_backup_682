In reality, we have about 80,000 transactions per day, and it is probably save to assume that far less than 50% of these stem from actual purchases.\n\nSecond, selling 10mm USD worth of bitcoin equals selling 30,000 bitcoin a day. The average total daily trading volume of all bitcoin exchanges put together was around 25,000 bitcoin a day in the last 90 days (excluding exchanges who do not charge transaction fees). Again, it is probably save to assume that only a fraction of these 25,000 bitcoin traded are actual sales from merchants.': 2, 'I have a much simpler explanation:  there are more coins for sale than being purchased.': 3, "> Btw the above numbers are just made up for the sake of example, they're not supposed to be accurate (although probably not very far off either).\n\nThe piece you quoted was just for the sake of example.\n\nBut the question is valid. The answer? I really don't know, it's very hard to know for sure. One interesting statistic is that there are only 3 million addresses that hold any amount of bitcoin. (and some of those addresses only hold pennies). Meaning that if you were to assume at minimum 1 address per person, there are rather few bitcoin users.\n\nOf course that assumption isn't valid. For example, Coinbase has 1.8 million wallets and they likely only have thousands of addresses, because they pool funds from many users onto a few cold-storage addresses. In other words, the 3 million addresses with bitcoin on them, might be shared by many more users.\n\nPersonally I think a quick n dirty calculation we can do is add up wallets. We probably have 7-8 million wallets or something in total. And then slap some sensible number on that, e.g. that on average a bitcoin user opened 5 wallets. Some open just 1, some open up 20. That would put the number of bitcoin users at something like 1.5m. I'd say the most conservative number is probably around 750k or something, an optimistic figure would probably put it around 4m realistically.\n\nAnd you can probably look at wallet growth and find out how many there were in say 2013. If you accept the assumption that an average user has 5 wallets today, it's likely the average user had 5 wallets in 2013, too. So if wallets exploded by 100% in 2014, then you can simply take today's wallets, half them, and then apply the 1 in 5 rule to get to users. Counting wallets is something we've got quite a bit of information on. e.g. Coinbase has 1.8m, Blockchain.info had 2.7m. It looks like there's about a 2.2x increase in wallets or so over 2014.\n\nBut it's really hard to say anything for sure :-/ But I'd probably put the number at 200k Jan 1st 2013, 600k Jan 1st 2014, 1.5m Jan 1st 2015.

Anonymization is when you can\'t, at all, know to whom any given data belongs to.

That difference in price represents a very real "tax" on credit card users that covers not just merchant fees, but also delays, chargeback risk, rolling reserve, etc.\n* Credit card payments only hit the bank account once per week, versus Bitcoin payments which arrive instantly. This is the sort of difference that distinguishes between 20th and 21st century payment systems.\n* Wire transfers carry fees up to $50. ACH transfers can take up to 3-5 business days. International wires can take weeks. Remittance options are few and far between, and those that exist practice price-gouging. This is absolutely ridiculous.\n* Accounts can be closed, frozen or confiscated and often are. Use Google to look up complaints from PayPal users, for example. Stories are often in the news regarding "undesirables" who are unable to get a bank account or a credit card merchant account.\n* None of these points even consider the lack of solutions for p2p transfers.\n\nNew payments technology such as Bitcoin not only solves these problems, but also opens up whole new spaces in areas such as micropayments and resource allocation between cloud APIs.\n\nBitcoin is going to change the world and New York is going to end up irrelevant if it doesn\'t take it seriously.

Bitcoin Core is the original wallet, but I suggest stay away from it unless you want to download the full blockchain, which can take several days.  Electrum and mobile wallets don't require that.  Electrum for example is an HD wallet, and it will give you a 12 word seed when you create it.  This seed serves as the backup for all of your coins because it can be used to create all of your private keys for that wallet.\n\nHaving your own wallet like Electrum is much different than a third party service like changetip or Coinbase.

Some examples:\n\nIn the long run Bitcoin\'s "advertised" source of security is that transaction fees will pay miners to participate in the POW process that secures Bitcoin.  But why will transaction fees be non-negligible? Because scarcity of blockchain capacity creates a competitive market for fees.  Just like Bitcoin is valuable because it\'s scarce, capacity needs to be valuable to drive fees. (An individual miner could ignore \'low\' fees, but it\'s in your own interest to take basically everything... so the equilibrium is very low fees)  Of course, miners can cartelize and enforce additional restrictions on the network... but thats a dirty road-- and incompatible with mining not having preset membership, it\'s much better if the system actually functions as designed and the rules are transparent. \n\nAnother example is that Bitcoin\'s security and autonomy depend on the users of Bitcoin interdependently verifying its integrity for themselves, not everyone but a very large amount... If you\'re not able to verify, if practically no one is, then we\'d be much safer with a system like paypal (spit) that makes its centralization transparent.\n\nOf course, there is a balance here:  If no one can transact because blocks are too small, the system is worthless to people.

Having the UTXO hashed isn't a proof, you need a proof so you know the UTXO is valid, otherwise you only have SPV security. I don't think a softfork is a problem at all, the problem is that you keep saying we should have the UTXO hash in the block header when you don't know the UTXO is valid without a proof. I mentioned SNARKs because they are a compact way to prove this.\n \nIf the UTXO hash would be in the protocol and part of the header's hash it would be as much a proof as that it is the right set as the longest chain is proof that you own a certain number of coins. If you read the proposal for MTUT, you'll see that the guy who wrote it also argues for a soft-fork approach which will eventually result in protocol enforcement. This is what I have in mind.\n\nEDIT: Another note wrt. to txn volume. 7txn/s is clearly ***NOT*** viable long-term, so hitting the block size limit on the way is different than keeping the BS at 1MiB all the time.

The problem is entirely in Bitcoin's reward structure.

In the future, when block rewards hit 0, there's nothing stopping miners from using monopoly tactics to kick out competition. This is a problem I personally cannot find a solution to, other than hoping it works itself out with time.\n\nIn the past we've seen that as it becomes necessary for miners to increase block size, they've done it.

Right now when transactions wait to be included in a block they are kept in a transaction pool and any new transactions they receive is passed along to other nodes, this is pretty much unordered and there is no strict syncing of transactions among nodes/miners so this usually means that if the other nodes are going to be able to verify the block a miner discovers, they need the whole block to be sure they get every transaction included in the block. This slows propagation considerably and introduces the incentive to miners to include few or even no transactions as it can impede the propagation if another miner finds a block at the same time. This is bound to get worse as the block size limit is raised and the rate of transactions increases. It will force fees up as miners will be less and less inclined to include transactions that have small fees. \n\nIBLT is used to make syncing transactions among nodes really easy and fast. What this does is it enables nodes to sync their pool of transactions with every other node so that when miners that are using IBLT as a means of syncing, they can simply pass the header to every node out there, and since all the transaction pools already have the transactions and they are catalogued using IBLT, they can use the header to reconstruct the block using their transaction pool instead of requiring the entire block be transmitted to them, anything missing from the block can be requested from other nodes quickly too. This will mean miners will be free to include transactions without fear of propagation delays and will be good for users as miners will not be incentivised to squeeze users for higher fees as the Bitcoin network grows.\n\ntldr; IBLT will allow nodes to manage pending transactions extremely easily so that transactions can be synced across nodes.

For much of 2012 and 2013, TPS ranged between 4-5, being remarkably stable. So I think you're right there, as far as efficiency goes in terms of fragmentation, it's probably not getting any worse. \n\nIt's just that, starting in 2014, maximum TPS has suddenly been going down again. Is this the effect of multi-sig transactions? I'm not against block size increases, it's just that currently we've mostly trended towards transactions using up more data, and if in the future we get other innovations that could potentially also increase transaction data sizes, increasing block size is going to have diminishing returns.

The rationale for that proposal is: those maximums are low enough so that even people running modest machines on reasonably good home broadband connections will still be able to run full nodes. The growth rate is less than the historical growth rate of network bandwidth (which shows no signs of slowing), and much less than CPU capability growth.\n\n>That solves the problem for the next twenty years. We\xe2\x80\x99ll start with a PayPal-transaction-volume-capable network (20MB blocks is PayPal-scale), and should end up with a network in 2035 capable of more transactions per second than visa, mastercard, discover, paypal, and in-person cash transactions combined, which you can run on your home-fiber network connection and that extra 32,000-core PentiumEleven processor.\n\n>Again, the only reason for a maximum block size is to prevent a super-majority cartel of miners from using their fast network connections and CPUs to produce blocks that the rest of the network takes a very long time to validate, driving the network to become centralized in just a few high-bandwidth data centers. That is the problem that needs to be addressed.\n\n>Also: it isn\xe2\x80\x99t true that \xe2\x80\x9cdevelopers wish to wait as long as possible\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 I\xe2\x80\x99ve been pushing to come to consensus on how to increase the block size for a long time, and am in the middle of testing the reference implementation code to make sure it won\xe2\x80\x99t break with a larger block size."\n\nI see what he\'s saying. I don\'t see why we can\'t limit the growth to say, double every 2 years, but also use a formula to determine if an increase is even necessary, to avoid even raising the bar when it isn\'t needed. Doubling it every 2 years would likely have the same affect as you mentioned, assuming ISPs like Comcast, ATT, etc don\'t step up their game and start offering gigabit internet at an affordable price within the next 10 years.\n\nAlso I fail to see why mining cartels would try to create large blocks to force out other miners. larger blocks take longer to propagate the network, which just puts them at risk of losing their rewards to an orphaned block. I\'m sure that if they create large blocks, it would likely be because they want the transaction fees/because they know relaying those transactions are needed, and not because they\'re filling it with spam.\n\nMost mining is pooled anyways, and most pools already have really good hosting. By creating large blocks, you\'re eliminating maybe less than 0.5% of your competition that uses p2pool instead of a pool. And even then, if they can\'t use p2pool, they\'ll probably move their miners to another pool anyways. From a profitability standpoint, it\'s not worth it to create a large spam block to scare away competition.\n\nUsing a formula to determine if a block size increase is even needed is a lot more effective way of preventing the feared "mining cartels" than just increasing it on a timer.

But at the end of the day, that merchant is going to put that cost in the price, and that insurance agency will charge Mastercard who will charge a merchant who will put it in a price. \n\nAnd YOU are paying that price.

Of course everyone still pays, because the individual theft is just paid for by MasterCard, who then charges everyone a little bit to stay profitable. They're not paying you back for theft for free. And I'll be the first one to say, this is a better system than individuals having to pay for individual theft.\n\nBut an even better system is a more secure way to do payments by design.
