The [libbitcoin](https://github.com/libbitcoin/libbitcoin) libraries provide a native implementation and [libbitcoin-consensus](https://github.com/libbitcoin/libbitcoin-consensus) packages the Core script validation rule sources as an optional independent library.\n\nLibbitcoin consists of nine independent libraries, one experimental and one build system.\n\n* libbitcoin\n* libbitcoin-blockchain\n* libbitcoin-build\n* libbitcoin-client\n* libbitcoin-consensus\n* libbitcoin-database\n* libbitcoin-explorer\n* libbitcoin-network\n* libbitcoin-node\n* libbitcoin-protocol\n* libbitcoin-server\n\nThe blockchain database uses a hash table design over file-mapped memory and offers tremendous query performance. The P2P networking, blockchain and server interfaces are asynchronous and multithreaded, based on the proactor pattern. The client-server protocol is built on the highly-scalable, performant, lightweight, and securable **ZeroMQ**. There is a comprehensive type library, set of hashing primitives and cryptographic wrappers for **libsecp256k1** (for Bitcoin) and **libsodium** (for CurveZMQ).\n\nThe libraries include automated builds for multiple configurations, including statically-linked single file, command-line-based, portable binaries for Linux, OSX and Windows. This includes server (bs), full node (bn) and explorer (bx) for mainnet and testnet. In other words deployment consists of placing one file on a machine. Server is a layer over the full node, adding the ZeroMQ query API, which includes stealth payment indexing and prefix-based retrieval.\n\nThe explorer command line tool can query server, build and post a tx to server, any node or a set of nodes discovered on the p2p network. It provides nearly 100 fully documented commands for working with all aspects of Bitcoin, hashes, ec math, stealth, keys, etc. Wallet commands support altcoins, for example:\n\nhttps://github.com/libbitcoin/libbitcoin-explorer/wiki/Wallet-Commands\n\nThe library makes extensive use of C++11 advances and supports clang, gcc and msvc compilers. The build system generates all of the build artifacts for all of the libraries, including single file comprehensive build scripts and automated continuous integration builds and test/coverage runs. Dependencies are minimal, consisting of (at most) those libraries mentioned above and **boost**.\n\nI hope this helps.

People need to be able to get through doors, and their lock makes that really easy, so that the most people possible can get through!

Our installer and Travis-CI builds operate directly against ZeroMQ master, so not only do we end up testing against each version, but nearly every change as it happens. We do this specifically so that we will be able to detect any possible interface drift well before it could ship in a ZeroMQ release package. We have never encountered an interface break and in fact the number of interim breaks resulting from this approach can be counted on one hand.\n\nI've found ZeroMQ to have a robust maintainer and user community. The few trivial problems that we've encountered (in master) have been resolved almost immediately, never more than 24 hours.\n\nCurveZMQ is based on Daniel Bernstein's CurveCP and NaCl.

Because mining is a poisson process most of the time blocks show up much faster than the mean, and any delays in processing make the mining process more like a race, conferring greater rewards for more centralization.\n\nIgnoring mining, validation isn't much faster than the block time then hosts will not catch up; and for decenteralization it's also important that the system work on lower end systems and without consuming an irritatingly large amount of resources on higher end ones. Validation speed has been one of the biggest complaints from Bitcoin Core users for some time; regressing performance to pre-libsecp256k1 levels wouldn't be a step to take lightly!\n\n> with signature validation caching\n\nAs explained in the post, block wide aggregation interferes with caching. It doesn't kill it completely, but much less of the work is cachable overall, and more memory is required to cache it.\n\n> Immaturity of pairing crypto implementations is a pretty good reason not to go for BLS, but it looks like there are implementations in C and Java that have been around for years (doesn't mean they've been well reviewed, of course).\n\nI wasn't talking about implementations in that posts-- but the cryptography itself. Though feel free to check the performance on those implementations: You'll find they are significantly slower than the numbers I was mentioning, as I was referring to hand-coded assembly state of the art implementations.\n\n> The ability for MINERS to combine all the signatures is really appealing\n\nYes, it's appealing as I noted years ago, but as I showed in my post existing transactions on the network today with only aggregation by the transaction author gets half the best possible asymptotic (infinite aggregation) gain.  And does so without new cryptographic assumptions or losses of performance. Thats beyond appealing-- I think it's a no brainer.\n\n> One 20-byte signature\n\n20 bytes would mean 160-bit group elements, or at the best case 80-bit security against a total system break. Especially considering that the pairing security story is necessarily weaker than general ECC security (pairing can be broken by general ECC advances, general integer discrete log advances, OR advances that implicate the special algebraic structure needed to make pairing possible), and parties are now recommending >256 bit for plain ECC; this doesn't seem prudent. Especially since the signature size itself is basically irrelevant after aggregation. Keep in mind that the aggregation gains are diminished if there are users using different ciphersuites for security reasons.\n\nI like after the fact aggregation for a number of reasons, engineered right it allows non-interactive coinjoin... it allows relaying nodes to add fees, and so on, but it has many costs.  By comparison the plain non-pairing aggregation looks like a strict upgrade from what we have today, and appears that it would already get half of the potential improvement or better (I ignored multisig) without users changing their current behavior.\n\n> PS: funny to see the communication chain on this one: \n\nPerhaps you mean on 2013-09-13?\n\n     21:38 < gmaxwell> sipa: I'm mildly excited about this pairing crypto aggregate signature idea.

The earlier way of doing efficient schnorr multisig proved the keys were unrelated by having the participants sign with them, which would have killed the space savings in the network if it was used to aggregate separate inputs. ... but using BLS aggregation for efficiency is not a new idea-- as the logs show, I was pointing it out in 2013.\n": 10, "TL;DR use Schnorr signature/key aggregation / batch verification plus Sipa's key tree sig trick to get up to 41% reduction in space usage for transactions with many inputs.

The vast majority of the validation is not actually moved to the critical path. A pairing must be calculated for each tx signature, but these pairings can be calculated and cached when a tx is first seen. Validating a block requires calculating one pairing e(g, sigma*) on the aggregate signature (sigma*) and a fixed point (g). This pairing is faster to compute than an arbitrary pairing because of the fixed point. The only other required calculation for block signature validation is a multiplication of all of the individual cached-pairings (assuming no unseen transactions). \n\nSo we do have some issue if a block contains a lot of new transactions, but even then there are optimizations that can be made to make the pairing speed more comparable to ECDSA verify.

This would reduce the real value of the 25 BTC bitcoin block reward, which will have a much larger effect on miner revenue than direct fees, at least for the next 4.5 years.

I worry that Bitcoin HODLers will be an exploitable resource in this fight causing fees to move heavily in the wrong direction until the bubble pops.': 1, 'There are two types of computations that need to be done when verifying a block. The first is elliptic curve digital signing algorithm (ECDSA) verifications. The second is hashing parts of the transactions to provide digests that the ECDSA verifications use.\n\nNormal transactions have the vast majority of their computational time taken up by ECDSA verifications. These are called "SigOps". A 1 MB block is permitted to have 20,000 (incorrectly counted) of these operations, and a 2 MB block with BIP109 is permitted to have 20,000 (correctly counted) of these operations. Typical 1 MB blocks have about **[5000](http://statoshi.info/dashboard/db/blocks)** sigops. A mid-range CPU can perform 5,000 or more verifications per second per core, so the worst case validation time due to sigops is around 4 seconds, and typical is 1 second or less. These sigops can be executed in parallel, and they also are usually executed when the transaction arrives in mempool rather than when the block arrives, so they are not usually a huge delay.\n\nA normal block would only have a few megabytes of data that needs to be hashed, like maybe 5 MB. Since even a laptop CPU can hash at around 130 MB/s (very fast!), this hashing only takes a few milliseconds, and can be ignored. \n\nIn the typical case, sigops comprise the vast majority of processing requirements, and bytes hashed can be ignored.\n\nIn the worst case, bytes hashed account for the vast majority of computational requirements, and sigops can be ignored.\n\nThere\'s a design flaw in the signature verification scheme. This flaw means that the amount of data that you need to hash in order to verify a transaction can be proportional to the **[square of the transaction size](http://dev.bitcoincore.org/~gavin/ValidationSanity.pdf)** (or specifically, the number of inputs times the total transaction size, IFF the SIGHASH_ALL flag is used). Thus, a 200 byte transaction might require 200 bytes of hashing, but a 1,000,000 byte transaction that is 99% inputs can require up to 1,200,000,000 bytes of hashing. And there\'s a dirty trick you can pull (which I prefer not to repeat in public forums) that will increase the bytes hashed about 15x for a 1 MB transaction. Even though hashing is a fast operation on CPUs, when you have to hash 19 GB of data, it will take several minutes to complete. This means that large *transactions* can be dangerous. Large blocks can be dangerous if they allow these large transactions to be made without any checks on their verification complexity. \n\nBIP109 and BIP101 both place checks on a transaction\'s complexity. The worst transaction that a non-miner would be allowed to create in BIP109 would be 100 kB and would only require a few MB of hashing. It should not be possible to make a 2 MB block that even comes close to the 1.3 GB hashing limit with regular transactions that can go over the p2p protocol. If the attacker is a miner, on the other hand, they can create worse transactions, and the 1.3 GB limit comes to play. This limits the worst-case scenario to about 10 seconds. Note that block 364292 was this worst-case scenario, and Bitcoin survived.\n\n> Also, I wasn\'t aware of the 1.3gb limit. So the 2mb limit could lead to the same number of txns as a 1mb limit if txn size doubles?\n\nNo, the 1.3 GB limit is only hit in the case of attack transactions.

People speculated about malicious intent, but it was quickly changed back, and there's an obvious [*Hanlon's razor*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanlon's_razor) answer to why you might end up with a 750KB cap: that's the default in Bitcoin Core, unless you change the configuration. So perhaps BTCC's was reset when (if?) they upgraded to 0.12.\n\nIf it seems like I've got that wrong, since their cap seems to be 7*3*0kB, not 750kB, that's only due to unit confusion. It's 750kB (where k = 1000\xe2\xa8\x89), or 732.421875KiB (Ki = 1024\xe2\xa8\x89), if we're using the modern units. However, a lot of sites use the older convention where kB means 1024\xe2\xa8\x89, which is a misleading way to measure block sizes given the maximum block size is 1000^2 bytes, not 1024^(2). [There's been a public call for Bitcoin sites to fix their units.](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/47uyfk/a_call_to_all_blockexplorer_websites_fix_your/)\n\nThere was a pull request half a year ago to raise Bitcoin Core's default block cap for mining to 1MB, but it was rejected.
