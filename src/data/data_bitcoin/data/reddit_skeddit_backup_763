I\'m excited that bitcoin seems to be the catalyst that is igniting the spirit of individual liberty in so many people.\n\n2 things:\n\n1. "Most people" sell when they make a significant profit.  It\'s the only prudent thing to do.  Yes there are long term holders, but it will make you feel worse to consider it a loss of $12,000,000 when in all likelihood you would have at least tapered down much much sooner than at that top.  It\'s the nature of speculation and I\'ve lost a lot on paper by locking in my profit, and a lot in reality thanks to not locking in my profit.  It\'s only natural.  Almost no one sells a the top except in their imagination in hindsight.  Consider when your \xc2\xa310 turned into \xc2\xa310,000, or \xc2\xa350,000.  You\'d have been out, and to get back in you\'d have had to spend that money to buy back in.  There\'s the catch 22 that only a time machine can solve.\n\n2. I\'ve written these words so many times but I believe them to be very important.  In the interest of truth and progress we need to direct our frustration at the right people.  IMO Corporate influence is not the source of the problem but a symptom.  The source of the problem is power and therefore influence for sale by our corrupt politicians and system.  We the people unfortunately elected these people and over generations allowed them to infringe on our rights and liberties and to grow their powers.  It\'s important for people to direct their angst against the right parties or we will never clean up this mess.  We must elect good people, proven uncorruptible representatives who demonstrate their understanding of our Constitution and one of the most important parts, that the Federal powers were designed to be very limited and that individual and states\' rights are paramount.  They must prove at every stage that they have and will work to roll back the growth of government.  Perhaps bitcoin and/or related technologies will make this effort irrelevant (I\'m hoping) but in the meantime we need to hack the powers back down to size to the extent possible.\n\nThere will always be someone trying to buy influence, whether its corporations or unions, trade groups or wealthy individuals etc..  The key is to limit what\'s for sale by limiting what we allow our representatives to do.  Limiting power limits corruption.  These are not new lessons we just keep having to learn them over and over, IMO since each generation only knows their starting point and few among them care to learn enough history to avoid repeating the cycles.\n\nThankfully we have technology on our side now, so perhaps it can help reverse the damage, put a stop to this cycle and fulfill the promise of liberty that our bold founding fathers so profoundly executed on at great peril.\n\n\n': 4, 'Loved that post.': 1, 'That is extremely kind of you.

This is another indication that there is hope that even the newer generations can see the problems.  I\'ve been impressed to see this over and over in this community, and am continually encouraged that this community (bitcoin supporters and innovators) seem to be actively fighting to restore liberty via decentralization of power.  It seems to almost happen automatically as people realize through bitcoin what could not have been realized with the system we currently have in which an individual has absolutely no financial privacy.  Our financial activity is stored and sold by credit card companies and is monitored by private citizens at banks in the name of "compliance" or can be demanded via the IRS who ironically "loses" their own important data to no detrimental effect (yet).  Until now, aside from cash and barter which is generally limited to in person trade, we\'ve not had the opportunity to contemplate why the government needs to be informed when we exchange value with one another.  Bitcoin almost forces us to ask why.  Why should some centralized regulators know that one person mowed another person\'s lawn or helped them build a fence or website etc.?  It was an individual\'s voluntary labor and that individual could have instead napped or watched TV.  Why does working, adding value, have to be reported to someone for taxation?  When you think about it that way it seems almost insane.  It\'s also insane that there are government endorsed exceptions that can be doled out to buy votes, but that\'s a topic for another thread.\n\nI also wanted to add that my research into this generational slippage over the years has pointed me firmly at the year 1913 (1911 technically but more so 1913).  In this year both the personal federal income tax was introduced and "coincidentally" The "Federal" Reserve.  1911 was the introduction of the federal corporate income tax.\n\nSide note, the progressive (from inception which is also another interesting concept for another thread) income tax rates started at 1% (for every person, no poverty line exceptions) and topped out at 7% for the highest earning citizens.  In just 5 years (in 1918) the rates had grown to [6% to 77%](http://taxfoundation.org/article/us-federal-individual-income-tax-rates-history-1913-2013-nominal-and-inflation-adjusted-brackets) and notice that the break from the top of the range for the 1% rate from 1913 at $20,000 income changed by 1918 so that same income then qualified you for the 20% bracket.  IMO this is an excellent, well documented and ominous demonstration of the repercussions of allowing the foot in the door to centralized power.\n\nA few years back I heard something that stuck with me.  I think it was from Walter Williams.  Prior to 1913 a citizen\'s interaction with the federal government was essentially limited to their interactions with the post office.  We know the reality of our interactions with the federal government now.  How could the people of the adult generation that existed in the world prior to 1913 justify leaving next generations such a drastically changed country?   IMO, since then generations have been almost equally guilty of handing down less liberty to the next generation, but they only fell prey to the slow boiling frog scenario.  The adults in 1913 were plunged into boiling water but didn\'t jump out.  I blame them the most.\n\nI know people have mixed feelings about Ayn Rand, but I think it\'s hard not to relate to this [speech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkivn_3zn5I).  I recently found [Mike Maloney](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCThv5tYUVaG4ZPA3p6EXZbQ) and his videos really seem to do a great job, to the extent I understand these complex systems, of explaining them in simple terms with a level head.  He runs a precious metals business so he\'s got a potential alternative motivation but I find him, his ideas and most of all his clear articulation and presentation very compelling.  I think he\'s doing it for the right reason, that also happen to be inline with his beliefs (a concept echoed in the speech).\n\nFinally, I\'ve been trying to put my finger on what it is about bitcoin that is helping it to be this catalyst and I think I can finally express it adequately, though perhaps not quite perfectly.  I think bitcoin has opened our eyes again to true freedom.  This may sound dramatic but I think we are as a society (small but growing) glimpsing the same sort of things that John Adams saw a glimmer of and then used to open the eyes of the other founders.  They saw then and we see now a thin point of light on the horizon, the opportunity to break from the chains of the prior history of the human condition.  Back then it was a rich land physically and therefore strategically isolated from the King\'s power with a wealth of opportunity for free trade and expansion.  They had to be bold and take great risks to even contemplate crossing swords with the greatest military on the planet.  I think we are at that same sort of cusp.  We can almost taste the future repercussions of this empowerment.  We are asked like they were just via circumstance why a percentage of our wealth or trade is due to be paid to some distant power, and to contemplate the implications of "simply" ignoring that power.  It\'s not really simple, but the reward, just like then, may outweigh the risks.  I think what we are seeing is human beings returning to their modern enlightened state, again noticing then declaring our individual sovereignty and casting aside these archaic notions that we need to be ruled, monitored, managed, coerced, limited, taxed, jailed etc. by a government that our founders set up to serve the people not the other way around.\n\nIt is a very exciting time.  In this case the counter-pandora\'s box to the one opened in 1913 was opened in 2008 with Satoshi\'s manifesto.  Let\'s hope and better yet, continue to work hard to open others\' eyes to the true freedom we\'ve all seen that glimmer of.\n\n\n\n\n\n': 2, "You're welcome. 1000 bits /u/changetip": 2}, ('BETA* BetBTC | The First Dedicated Bitcoin Sports Exchange', 3): {'If I may offer a suggestion, which may not be possible given the design of your platform and cost structure, I believe you should considering lowering your minimum bet. \n\nI currently use another bitcoin-only sportsbook that offers .001 minumum, which is quite attractive to those who just want to play around with a small amount of money or just test out the platform without loosing a significant dollar amount.': 2, "Thanks for your feedback.

These chains of references form the "blockchain".\n\nNaturally the question then is "Where do these Bitcoins originate?" and the answer is they are all coming from block solutions.  When a miner solves a block, he instantly broadcasts the solution throughout the network and other miners immediately start working on the solution for the block after that one.  It\'s like a never ending race, and everyone is trying to have the longest mathematically-correct chain.\n\nSo making the longest chain becomes a daunting task for a cheater.  In order to cheat the network, you need to solve every block faster than every other miner combined.  And honest miners always outnumber the cheaters.  This arrangement means we can trust Bitcoins and their input transactions because they reference an edifice that could only have been built by the fastest robots (ASICs).
