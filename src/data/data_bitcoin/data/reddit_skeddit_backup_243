You're then open to double-spending attacks.\n>  -   If you rely on transactions with 0 confirmations, the attacker can just filter out certain transactions to execute a double-spending attack.\n>  -   Low-latency encryption/anonymization of Bitcoin's transmissions (With Tor, JAP, etc.) can be defeated relatively easy with a timing attack if you're connected to several of the attacker's nodes and the attacker is watching your transmissions at your ISP.\n\n> Bitcoin makes these attacks more difficult by only making an outbound connection to one IP address per /16 (x.y.0.0).

This is just an intuition of yours, and I would return to you that in value, a lot more bitcoins are protected by the Armory software than by Circle. But that too is an intuition, because unlike Circle, we at Armory have no way of knowing this (and that's a good thing!).\n\nClearly businesses that are serious about Bitcoin don't look at Circle to handle their funds. They need a full stack like Armory offers, and this is why our true calling is with enterprise features. The ecosystem needs high grade enterprise solutions to move forward, and we work to provide that service in its fullest.\n\nCircle does a good job on their end of the spectrum, but do not presume we operate on the same premises.\n\nYou complain Armory's interface is clunky but this is the level of knowledge and awareness it takes to operate the full Bitcoin stack. There is no security to be had with Armory if you do not use it properly. The complexity comes with the territory. You should keep 2 key parameters in mind:\n\n1) Security is the antagonist of convenience. A 10 tons safe is secure, but inconvenient. Cash in your pocket is convenient but insecure. Credit cards are very convenient and terribly insecure.\n\n2) The one thing worse than the lack of security is the illusion of security. At least with the former, you are aware of your limitations and can prepare accordingly.\n\nCertainly Armory pales in the face of Circle if your goal is hold pocket change in a hot wallet to purchase coffee. A centralized system will always beat a decentralized one when it comes to performance and convenience. But at what cost? \n\nIf you use Bitcoin without the decentralization, the privacy and the censorship resistance, then I would posit you are missing on some of its greatest features. \n\nCertainly it is not my place to tell you how to be part of the network, but do not believe your way is the only way.

I would develop entire tools in command line if it was up to me (be thankful it isn't!). I respect the work our team has put in it (again, no thanks to me). I made the wallet recovery tool, and consequently I had to integrate it into the GUI, and I hated every minute of it. Qt4 + Python is like nails on chalkboard to me. Even though, my teammates chugged it along and delivered something that will qualify of fit for the task.\n\nWhat you need to consider is how much effort UI development takes. On eachfeature we develop, UI takes about 50% of our time, and I expect this figure is low compared to the industry's baseline. For example, I'll take the last piece of UI I worked on: You may not have noticed it but the transaction ledgers are not broken down into pages anymore since 0.93. Instead, you simply scroll along, same as a tumblr photo wall. Implementing that was a biblical battle with Qt4. It took me longer to figure that out than to implement the scalability features in the underlying database. The teammate that took over me to fix the last couple bugs will tell you the same.\n\nI am not saying we won't improve the UX because we are lazy (although I in particular am when it comes to that), but simply put, there are tons of stuff that take priority. Also, since we don't have a UX designer by trade on our staff, we usually go with KISS. That certainly isn't elegant, and far from me to pretend our UX is great. I will pretend that it gets the job done however.\n\nWe have had talks internally about UX. Our long term idea was to contract a pro to overhaul the GUI when we moved to Py3 + Qt5, since we could later leverage that work for web pages and mobile apps. The word until then is minimal changes. My crusade with the transaction ledgers was only allowed because it leveraged the backend's new scalability.\n\nNow, don't get my wrong. I know what you mean when you talk about our market share on the consumer front, but truth be told, this is not our target demographic. Our ideal customer is a business that can afford IT staff, whom we direct to setup a supernode server. The officers in charge of funds management get a documentation detailing step by step how to handle cryptographic material and spend coins. They never see the technical side of Armory (they plug into their in-house supernode server through litenode clients) and they go through highly detailed steps to handle BTC. They pay us for a support license, which they rarely make use of because somehow we managed to do a good job with the entire stack, and everybody is happy.\n\nThat's what enterprise level clients want, and they're the guys we make a living from. The relationship with our open source users is completely different. We deliver free code, they give us free testing and feedback in return. This is another relationship where everybody is happy. Well, for the most part.\n\nBut clearly UX is not our priority. The business guys don't care, they get the instructions manuals. It's too much effort for the return to justify it only by demand of open source users. The users that don't like our UI we can't get with just a couple fixes. This is a huge battle that we will fight on another day. The users we currently have, they want open source development to be resumed. They want litenode capabilities, BIP32 wallets, blocks over P2P and tons of other stuff. UX is icing on the cake as far as they're concerned. \n\nI can fight that fight.
