Macroeconomics is a different beast that\'s not easily understood (I\'d argue that it not possible to understand it completely, more on that later).\n\nLike it or not there\'s a real price associated with running the Bitcoin network and someone has to pay it. Garzik\'s argument for increasing the blocksize now is essentially (paraphrasing) "we didn\'t do a good job of letting the masses know fees would be increasing, we should delay it a little longer." I think he\'s right on in the argument. Many of the other devs argument is that security properties must be maintained no matter what, because once the decentralized system is broken it can\'t be fixed easily. I also agree with that argument. Finding the right balance is where the art and science is going to have to take place.\n\nWhat I don\'t agree with is taking the most obvious solution and keep turning it up without adequately addressing the externalities. I\'ve read just about all information I can find on the subject (dev-list, academic papers, bitcointalk dev forum, etc.) and to me no one has all of it figured out. Some are a lot more honest about it, though. The problems are similar to the ones that early rocketry faced... there are obvious simple solutions that are wrong. \n\nThe meta-argument going on is about how big is Bitcoin going to get. If it\'s going to be a low-throughput system then it needs to have very different economics to maintain security. If it\'s high-throughput it will require different economics to maintain security. I\'d like to see a BIP that addresses both of those realities. BIP100 gets a little closer to hitting the mark than BIP101, but I\'d like to see something a bit more automated and less miner controlled. I don\'t care for the voter mechanism in its suggested implementation and would prefer something a bit more automated.\n\nThat said, some of the problems we are trying to address are not trivially automated. Certain things seem to "unknowable" to the network which may be more obvious to us meatbags. For example, let\'s say there are three mining pools in a city that make up 75% of the hashrate of the network. They VPN out so their GeoIPs look way different. By network topology, they appear to independently acting, but in the meatspace they are in the same area, which would be undesirable. So how do we protect against that?
