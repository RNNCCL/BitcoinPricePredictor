If expected profits were >0, more mining resource would enter, and profits would reduce.  If expected profits were <0, mining resource would leave, increasing profits.\n\nWhat it does affect is the amount of hashing and network security you get.  Eg if electricity costs fall (or heating appliances start running mining rigs which offset those costs), then profits rise and more mining happens - which reduces profits back to zero, but increases the amount of mining, obviously, and therefore the degree of network security.\n\nEdit:  none of this really addresses the (separate) issue of centralisation - which you mention at the start of the post.

I have a bit of a technical discussion I\'d like to start and this Reddit AMA I believe is a good place to have it, so that others can give their input.  I wanted to mention I am an embedded software engineer (professionally for a living) although my crypto/bitcoin implementation understanding is my weakness (hence some of the questions below).\n\nTechnical discussion topic overview:\n\n- Choice of hardware\n\n- The $10 Trezor dev board?\n\n- Hacking the Trezor\n\n- Moving beyond Trezor, offline transactions?\n\n\n\n\n- Choice of hardware\n\nIt seems to me you chose the STM32 F205 because of A) its USB OTG support and B) because of the Random Number Generator (RNG) support.  You\'ve also mentioned that you used opencm3 because you didn\'t want to pay for proprietary licensing.  Why not use one of the Atmel CryptoAuthentication chips for the RNG instead?  This would have the benefit of having more secure storage of private keys with a purpose-built chip as well as hardware accelerated crypto support (not sure how helpful that would be, maybe faster signing?).  You can get those Atmel chips as low as $0.06 each in QTY=1000 which is amazingly cheap!  This would allow you to potentially use a cheaper main microcontroller and bring down the costs of the Trezor significantly.\n\n- The $10 Trezor dev board\n\nThe STM32 lines are well known for their "Nucleo" dev board which only cost $10.  From what I\'ve seen on DigiKey, the cost of the STM32 F205 microcontrollers themselves at QTY=1000 is about $4.45.  This tells me that adding the cost of the other components (Nucleo boards also include STM32 F103 chips for the ST-LINK!) that ST Micro is taking a huge loss in order to subsidize the cost of these dev boards to get them in the hands of developers hoping that they will incorporate them into their design.  This represents a huge opportunity for Bitcoin geeks because...\n\nThe STM32F4[01/11] Nucleo boards are only $10 and include the same RNG support as on your F205.  The Nucleo boards are great because they support re-enumeration of a USB serial port on the ST-LINK side of the board.  This allows your MCU application to speak over a serial port to your PC.  This means you could take a stock Nucleo board, wire up your OTG USB port (as per your schematic) on pins PA11 and PA12, add a bit of library support to re-route the OLED print statements to the USB serial connection, and you\'d have a $10 Trezor dev board!  Am I missing anything?  The only gotcha that I have seen is that ST Micro does not allow you to re-sell the Nucleo boards (likely because they are greatly subsidizing them).  I think this would be a great option for savy crypto geeks to get their hands on Trezor functionality.  If the USB serial port bothers you for security (you could sniff that port an see what the "Trezor OLED screen" sees), you could add a Arduino-compatible OLED screen from Adafruit for $19.  Still a cheap overall option for savy crypto geeks.\n\n\n- Hacking the Trezor\n\nThis is where my understanding of the Trezor crypto details is a bit fuzzy:  Is the private key held in memory some place on the STM32 chip?  If so, what is to keep me from opening up the Trezor, soldering on my 4 wires to connect the ST-LINK/V2, firing up the free version of IAR EWARM (taking advantage of their hardware debugger support), and dumping the memory from the STM32 chip to recover the secret private key?\n\n\n- Moving beyond Trezor, offline transactions?\n\nThe Trezor has really captured my imagination.  Is it possible to make a similar device that only has NFC communication that would allow for card-2-card offline transactions?  I know the first thing you\'re going to say is that you couldn\'t trust such a device because it would allow people to double-spend (Backup your private key elsewhere, send your bitcoin to another address, and then continue to fool your friend into accepting a NFC peer-2-peer offline transaction that will be invalid when he reconciles the card).  But my idea is a bit different.  What if the card A) Didn\'t allow you to access the private key (it is generated, stored, and has no ability to retrieve the key)  and B) is Tamper resistant.  This would be a whole new paradigm for small transactions where you transfer BTC from card to card offline and it is secure because nobody (using that same card from a "trusted manufacturer") has access to the private keys and hence can\'t double-spend.  The private key would be safe from the manufacturer too, just like Trezor because it would be generated when the user first opens the package, seeded from random button pushes on the card.\n\nMy weakness is in understanding the bitcoin wallet details.  It seems to me the card could have knowledge of UTXOs and create signed, valid transactions that would be reconciled when either party went home and reconciled their card against their NFC phone or NFC card-enabled ATM for example.\n\nWhat do you think of this idea?': 16}, ('So lets say I wanted a bitcoin ATM.... how does one go about "renting" a space for one?', 13): {'Unless you are doing a lot of volume, the cost of rent alone for a larger 2/way machine is going to kill you.

What I\'m saying is that: \n\n1) these things will still have value, people will just have to be more careful with which stocks and which real estate they buy. I think that, in the near future, businesses will monetize by issuing reward points as cryptoequities and this will be the incentive for people to buy and hold. You\'ll need to be way more careful about which equities you invest in than currently, but it\'ll still be very profitable to pick the good ones early. Here\'s a reddit comment I wrote that touches on this: http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/2o1apz/bitcoin_encourages_actual_saving_something_most/cmiua2c\n\nAs for real estate, again, it\'ll still be profitable, just more difficult, to buy low and sell high. \n\n2) you say in your article\n\n> However, it will also hurt the hundreds of millions of people.

': 1, "> So we have a paradox: we expect to see an increase is disorder, yet instead we see growing towers of complexity. The solution to the paradox is an expanding universe. While disorder always increases in the universe as a whole, towers of order emerge in small, localized pockets.\n\nBut how does an expanding universe explain localized pockets of increased complexity? If anything, wouldn't it by itself add to ease of energy dissipation and make order even harder?\n\nI think the hypothesis that more complex structures dissipate energy more efficiently is a much better explanation, but it's still a bit of a mystical leap in the context of global finance. To go along with it anyway, assuming this theory, complex structures that scale in order to consume more energy are preferred.\n\nHowever, since Bitcoin is a part of humanity, I don't think its energy expenditure by itself is relevant. Also it's quite likely that it is still way more efficient (i.e. requires less energy) than the financial system it is supposed to replace.\n\nSo what we're left with is whether Bitcoin will make humanity consume more energy. On the minus side, we have deflation, which may lead to more efficient use of resources (less waste). On the plus side, there may be increased activity as a result of a better connected economy and technological progress.\n\nIf we are to take these assumptions seriously, the Bitcoin optimist needs to believe that it will cause humanity to progress economically (which I assume directly means more energy consumption) with less power being allocated to temporary desires. It could fit well to a humanity that actively works to transcend the boundaries of this planet, among other similar sci-fi scenarios. \n\nRegardless, the scale is so tiny in the grand scheme that all this speculation is probably pointless.\n": 2, 'Concise, articulate writing, with excellent ideas.

But it is sometimes remarkable how political contexts can evolve. And in relation to that I think that it is possible that \xe2\x80\x98the Keynesians\xe2\x80\x99 are like a political faction that will become less influential as a result of a political evolution\xe2\x80\xa6.(All over the world varieties of states make claims to have governments very properly or even ideally devoted to the interests of the citizens or nationals of those states and always an externally located critic can argue that the government is actually a sort of despotism.)\n\n>The Keynesian implicitly always have the argument that some good managers can do things of beneficial value, operating with the treasury and the central bank, and that it is not needed or appropriate for the citizenry or the \xe2\x80\x9ccustomers\xe2\x80\x9d of the currency supplied by the state to actually understand what the managers are managing, what exactly they are doing and how it will affect the \xe2\x80\x9cpocket book\xe2\x80\x9d circumstances of these \xe2\x80\x9ccustomers.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n>I see this as analogous to how the \xe2\x80\x9cbolshevik communists\xe2\x80\x9d were claiming to provide something much better than the \xe2\x80\x9cbourgeois democracy\xe2\x80\x9d that they could not deny existed in some other counties. But in the end the \xe2\x80\x9cdictatorship of the proletariat\xe2\x80\x9d seemed to become rather exposed as simply the dictatorship of the regime. So there may be an analogy to this as regards those called \xe2\x80\x9cthe Keynesians\xe2\x80\x9d in that while they have claimed to be operating for high and noble objectives of general welfare what is clearly true is that they have made it easier for governments to \xe2\x80\x9cprint Money\xe2\x80\x9d.\n\n>So I see the Keynesians as in a weak sense comparable to the \xe2\x80\x9cBolsheviks\xe2\x80\x9d because of the support of both parties for a certain \xe2\x80\x9clack of transparency\xe2\x80\x9d relating to the function of government as seen by the citizenry. And for both of them it can be said that they tend to think in terms of government agencies operating in a benevolent fashion that is, however, beyond the comprehension of the citizens of the state.\n\n>**And this parallel makes it seem not implausible that a process of political evolution might lead to the expectation on the part of citizens in the \xe2\x80\x9cgreat democracies\xe2\x80\x9d that they should be better situated to be able to understand whatever will be the monetary policies which, indeed, are typically of great importance to citizens who may have alternative options for where to place their \xe2\x80\x9csavings\xe2\x80\x9d**.\n\n': 1, 'Wow confirmed fake name': 2, 'It IS his real name.': 1, '> Adam really has been the most vocal long-time cypherpunk on Bitcoin, founded blockstream etc...\n\nHardly.

This is reported and taxed as normal income. You report income being the fair value of the BTC in payment. So if you did a job for $200 but paid in BTC, you had $200 income. You can treat it as being paid in cash for tax purposes.

You have made $5 capital gains income.\n\n* This gets reported on Schedule D of your 1040. You can enter it in TurboTax in the Capital Gains section.\n* If you had own those coins for a year or less, the tax rate is just you normal tax.

The rate is 0%, 15% or 20% depending on your other income. Again, TurboTax will deal with this as long as you enter the dates.\n* Any gains less than $0.50 can be ignored, as the tax forms round to the nearest dollar. So if you had only bought a $5 gift card in the above example your gain would have only been $0.25.\n\nIf you can't get the original cost from the records, you would have to estimate it at least based on  your bank records of sending money to the exchange in the first place.\n\nI'm not sure I understand the question on your loan.\n": 2, "Yes, it's all just for accounting anyway, as you can't actually select the explicit coins to spend, so you just remove the numbers from your totals.\n\nSo if you use First-In-First-Out then when you spent a coin, you'd nominally take the oldest one you have and it's cost basis.\n\nOf course it might be more tax advantageous to use one closest to the sale price to minimize any gains. Or, even use the most expensive one to maximize losses. All depends on your circumstances.\n\nI'm looking into the loan thing, mainly because I don't know if the interest you would owe can be used to offset any gains you might make if the value of the BTC you were loaned (and spent) increased.
