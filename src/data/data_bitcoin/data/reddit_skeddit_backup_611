Most people spend most of their money on food, shelter, utilities, and other necessities.  They will do so regardless of whether the currency is inflating or deflating.  Most people also have wants they desire in the near term, like going to a new movie release, or flowers for the garden.  They are not necessities, but their timing is limited.  This part of the economy will also continue to happen.\n\nDumb economists also ignore "real rates of return".  That is the nominal rate of return on an investment minus inflation.  It tells you how much real stuff you can buy in the future.  Deflation just means a negative inflation rate, so it adds to to nominal rate instead of subtracts.  The investment world is competitive, and investors will still demand a similar real rate for the risk they are taking.  So in a deflationary environment, the nominal rate of return will adjust downwards to get the desired result.  Thus people will still have reason to save and invest.\n\nThus we see that the deflationary boogyman is entirely unwarranted.  However, for central bankers, they can\'t appropriate as much of the economy in a deflationary world, because there is less need to issue more currency.

All the nations of the world would try to hoard as much gold for their defense budgets as possible, and it would leave the economy without the very thing that allows it to function.\n\nThis scenario (in a less extreme form) has already happened with gold, and it\'s why we moved to a currency with no intrinsic value.

There are some exceptions to that, like if the seller has a monopoly on the product.  So we can conclude from the price difference that it is probably more trouble for the Trezor people to make a Trezor for you than it is for the BWallet people to make BWallet for you.  This means that if you buy a BWallet instead of a Trezor, you probably reduced the overall amount of work that people had to do in the world.  This should improve the economy at least, and I think that it is also correlated to the environment, because the trouble that people are going through to make a Trezor involves driving, shipping components, running SMT soldering machines, and generally consuming energy.  Consuming energy is generally considered to harm the environment.\n\nThere are all sorts of holes that can be poked in this argument, sure.  Maybe the price of the Trezor is higher only because the worker's salaries are higher, but they don't directly consume more energy in making it.  Well, if the workers' salaries are higher it means that they would have done comparatively more good for the world if they had worked somewhere else, and the good that they would have done at the other place might translate into a better environment because they would be saving the time and energy of others.\n\nYou might argue that the Trezor price is artificially high right now because they *had* a monopoly.  Or some entity might be subsidizing BWallet and selling it for a loss.  I don't really have all the answers, and maybe the environment argument is kind of weak, but I still think that prices are a good way to tell what the social cost of an item is.

You're incentivising innovation/product development by going with Trezor. With B-Wallet you are incentivising cheap goods production, which is good if the good is as good as the Trezor (the service is not, as it does not include research & development). If it is the case though, that the B-Wallet good is produced as well as the Trezor good, then Trezor should team up with the B-Wallet team, to have them produce the hardware/goods and Trezor develop it (and the software), and then have B-Wallet pay a percentage of sales revenue to the Trezor team; this would have the best overall effect. It would increase the profits of both companies, B-Wallet would benefit from the good-will of supporting the development, as all the people currently supporting Trezor would buy B-Wallet, and there would be more total sales because of the less expensive product; we would all benefit from continued R&D.\n\nEdit: [According to Trezor](http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/2tyier/bwallet_review_by_trezor_developer/), they actually produce the Trezor cheaper than the B-Wallet is produced; the extra cost of Trezor is to fund R&D, so there is no justification to buy the B-Wallet, besides that you just can't afford the Trezor.

These networks have simultaneously been promoted as currencies but have not functioned well as such.
