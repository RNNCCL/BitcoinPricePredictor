This means the difficulty during era 3 is higher, when he again stops mining. He gets to mine during lower difficulties and stops mining during higher difficulties.\n>\n>Because of the knife-edge of profitability, and his relatively large mining power (though crucially nowhere near 51%) other rational miners will spot the pattern and also only mine during *even* eras, it doesn\'t make sense for them to mine the harder to get coins.\n>\n>This causes further difference between the "easy" short eras and the "hard" long eras.

It was still possible to get money into the exchange but in the later months of July-December 2013 it became increasingly more difficult to withdraw fiat. \n\nEither because of it's longstanding weathered reputation, or naivety, (or both), users still were still using MtGox (bitcoin withdrawals were working fine) but in increasingly smaller numbers.

What they didn't know at the time was that MtGox was effectively insolvent and was trying to make back money in fees. \n\nBy January 2014 MtGox was beginning to have serious issues with fulfilling users bitcoin withdrawals.  The price of bitcoin in general (and on the exchange itself) was plummeting as a result of the news.

AFAIK you can only link cards with a billing address, so no AMEX Gift Cards (I tried, no luck). However, you can also link your bank account which is really convenient, if you don\'t mind giving out your info. Thankfully, my bank is really good about fraudulent charges and unauthorized transactions, so I feel secure enough to have gone that route.\n\nWhen you log in, if you\'ve already linked a card/account, you\'ll see your current Circle.com balance in both BTC and USD, along with two buttons (Add Funds, Withdraw Funds). Click the "Add Funds" button and where it says "Amount", click the green "USD" icon and it\'ll switch to BTC, allowing you specify an amount in BTC rather than USD. It will show the method you\'ll be using to buy the BTC below, along with the total price. If everything looks good, click "Desposit Money" and the balance you just specified will be instantly added to your Circle.com balance. \n\nTo withdraw Bitcoin to an external address, start over at the main page that shows the two green buttons and find the link above that says "Send Money". Click it, fill in the address you want to send BTC to, click the green "USD" icon to toggle between BTC and USD, include a message if you like, and click "Continue".
