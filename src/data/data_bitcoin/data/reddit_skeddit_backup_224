Most people work to make money, to pay their bills, not because they are aligned with their corporations goals. Does that make them greedy?\n\nThe incentive system is why bitcoin has any value at all, Bitcoin uses peoples desire for money/power to secure the network. \n\nSpeculators looking to make money due to the deflationary schedule add value that allows the miners to continue expanding and increasing the hashrate.\n\nAt the end of the day it comes down to beliefs about human psychology. Why do people do anything at all? It can be argued that all behavior is either seeking reward or retreating from pain. Even "altruistic behavior" is usually accompanied by an internal reward, does that mean a person can only truly be altruistic when they receive no satisfaction from behaving that way?\n\nI\'m no Gordon Gecko, I\'m not going to say that Greed is good, it is clearly not. However we must recognize that greed is a natural (perhaps the most natural) human motivator. Therefore we can attempt to create systems that use peoples natural tendency for greed to secure the system rather than be a liability for the system.\n\n\nConsider a private blockchain made by the banks. A private chain and each member bank is given "minting/mining" keys that allows them to create currency at will. The incentive for the banking system as a whole is to play nice and not cheat this system. However individuals with access to the mining keys may find themselves being incentivized by rogue banks or black market participants more than they are incentivized by the banking system itself. With no proof-of-work and relying on secret keys these private blockchains and their secret keys if they ever became valuable would be immense targets. If someone got a hold of the mining keys they may be able to create $1000 trillion and distribute them as they see fit, imploding the financial system as we know it.\n\nBitcoin on the other hand allows anyone to mine blocks and secure transactions, whoever "hacks" the hash first wins. Everyone can participate and it is impossible to cheat. There are no secret mining keys that produce coins from nothing. I really hope the banks do not move forward with their private blockchains as they are creating the incentive for financial Armageddon. \n\nSo yes, peoples incentives can bias their behavior, but acting on incentive is not in itself wrong.

Again, in Bitcoin\'s history, I\'ll point to the experience that BFL\'s customers received, and ask people to compare outcomes of those who bought with BTC and tried to get refunded versus credit card purchasers.\n\n6) **deflation** - by witness of all the HODLers around here, it should be clear that deflation is not something we should strive for. If there\'s a major shortfall in the theory of bitcoin, I think this ones it.... Despite the simplest premise (my money gets more valuable so prices come down), deflation is actually not a good thing.\n\n7) **Programmability** - seems cool on the surface, and apparently its needed for things like Lightning to work, but beyond that, it\'s use seems more theoretical.... Yes, you could time lock a transaction for 100 years. What if you die, and the recipient dies? That money is gone. With dollars and fiats, that money can be directed somewhere else. And the division of estates thing is a non-feature. The challenge with estates is in liquidating them in the first place (especially if beneficiaries dispute things, how much the asking price of a house should be, who gets what). Once all the money is in an account, its trivial to send 3 checks out.\n\n8) **multisig** - I don\'t know if this is a feature that regular people clamored for, or if it was a feature born out of necessity for the way that Bitcoin operates. \n\n9) **bitcoin 2.0** - We\'ll see how these things go... All to be determined.\n\n10) **monetary sovereignty** - This is good and bad. To non-history buffs, who just look at the last 10 years, the Fed seems completely incompetent and therefore of course we need to get away from them. Scale that back over 500 years and the economy under the Fed is a much more resilient creature.\n\nAnd I\'ll dispute this ongoing notion that dollars are backed by nothing and worthless. Dollars have value because every single person in the world agrees that they have value. Gold is valuable because nearly every person in the world agrees its valuable. Bitcoin? Bitcoiners think it has value, but go up to that homeless guy in the earlier example, and offer him $10 USD or 1 BTC, which do you think he\'ll choose? Go to Afghanistan or Sudan and make the same offer to the populace. Same result.

Such points are there to be made.\n\nIn #6 you also bundle in profit potential without explaining how it\'s related to deflationary currency.\n\nIn #6 you introduce the concept of greater divisibility vs the US dollar but A. don\'t really explain why this is beneficial and B. don\'t account for the fact that higher divisibility of the dollar has never been a bit problem and gets increasingly irrelevant as the currency inflates.\n\nAlso in #6 you round out with the infrastructure comment without overtly explaining how it\'s different from fiat.

At that point bitcoin will become a *deflationary* currency. All other currencies are inflationary: more money is printed, so the relative value of one unit goes down. Bitcoin will be the reverse: no more money is printed, so as demand rises, the value of one unit goes UP. This is an enticing prospect: not only does bitcoin serve as a value transfer system (pay people/businesses for stuff) and a store of wealth (bank), over the long term it could be a very reliable source of investment revenue generation (pension/stocks & shares).': 1, 'which brings to forefont the question of authenticated digital cameras.

This is a service you could buy from a provider of such. (Have you tried to get your bank or credit union to pay routine bills so long they are, each, under some maxiums you specify? My experience is that they dont want to deal with that hassle.)\n\n> 2) bail ins - No additional risk here, that I see. The same basic premise is in place - if you keep your dollars under a mattress, you can\'t be forced to bail a bank in (you also lose interest income, which used to be something, and likely will be again one day).\n\nIt has been a long time since interest rate on most bank accounts have been above actual inflation.\n\n> HOWEVER - seems a huge amount of people use online wallet services and exchanges as wallets; they could absolutely be forced to "bail in" a failing exchange.\n\nWhich is, incidently, why many people tell them not to use exchanges accounts as bank accounts.\n\n> 3) Negative Interest Rates - these are not a normal state of affairs; they\'re caused because the powers that be want to push people into increasing economic activity, which is likely a good thing.\n\nYou* cant spend yourself* into prosperous economy, contrary to popular belief.

To non-history buffs, who just look at the last 10 years, the Fed seems completely incompetent and therefore of course we need to get away from them. Scale that back over 500 years and the economy under the Fed is a much more resilient creature.\n\nLets see. The Federal reserve was founded after the independecne and creation of the United States of (north) America so it is less than two hundred years old. Before it most people used gold, silver or, sometimes, honey for international settlements. For more local concerns, tally staves (not sure about what they are called in English but Norweigans used them) kept track of debt owed and such. Rather stable, modulo hardships such as crop failures and such.\n\nWith the fed, well continual boom and bust cycles (one nasty one is called the Great Depression), continous printing of currency (quantive easing) and increasing debt that never goes away. To mention a few. I would say that the economy under the Fed had to become more resilient due it.\n\n> And I\'ll dispute this ongoing notion that dollars** are backed by nothing and worthless.\n\nYou are right, it is backed by threat of violent force while bitcoin is backed up with consensual consent that it has value.\n\n> Dollars** have value because every single person in the world agrees that they have value.\n\nStrange assertation, that. I personally find dollars** worth little as they are I-Owe-Untos issued by the USA government.\nPeople in USA and doing business there find them somewhat more valueable as they are only thing accepted as payment for taxes. \n\n(** I assume here that you are talking about USD and not the dollars made of gold to old spanish specifications)\n\n> Gold is valuable because nearly every person in the world agrees its valuable.\n\nThat strange assertion again. Most people agree that gold is valueable because it is rather rare, shiny and rather hard to fake. \n\n> Bitcoin? Bitcoiners think it has value, but go up to that homeless guy in the earlier example, and offer him $10 USD or 1 BTC, which do you think he\'ll choose?\n\nDepends on where he can exchange it more easily for, say, a hot meal. Because the network effect and it being the only accepted medium for payment of taxes most places more readily accept the USD.\n\n> Go to Afghanistan or Sudan and make the same offer to the populace.\n\nMost would accept the USD because they know they can go to a nearby beuro de exchange and get local currency for it but that isnt as certain if USD was not as well known worldwide as it is today.\n\nWhat would you do if I offered you say 10000 ISK or 1 BTC?\n\n> Bitcoin has value because we think it does,\n\nYes and same applies to USD or other govermental fiat currency.
