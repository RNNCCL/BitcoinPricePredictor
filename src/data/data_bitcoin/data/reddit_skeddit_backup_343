': 0, 'Next year at the Halvening.': 2, 'Do forget the winklevii ': 2, 'The idea that there won\'t be another bubble (which some have argued in the comments) is silly.  The odds favor multiple additional bubbles. Here\'s why:\n\n1) Bitcoin is an open, permissionless network with never-before-seen capabilities.   In short, it allows a great many important things to happen that were previously impossible, and ANYONE can join and innovate on the network without permission or authorization.  \n\n2) Networks have value, and networks with unique capabilities have unique value.\n\n3) We have accepted ways of valuing networks--Metcalfe\'s Law (which is increasingly suspect) and the "n log(n)" valuation metric.  The two agree that a network\'s value varies with the number of users, they differ only in how much the value increases with each additional user.  \n\n4) Individual bitcoins represent, essentially, a transferable license to use the Bitcoin network.  Without possessing and transferring at least a fraction of a bitcoin, the Bitcoin network is useless to you.\n\n5) Thus, if using the Bitcoin network has value, then individual bitcoins have value.  Anyone who has spent any time with Bitcoin knows that that there are a nearly infinite number of use cases for a scaled-up Bitcoin network.  \n\n6) Prior to Bitcoin, the world had seen only one other open, semi-permissionless network with never-before-seen capabilities--the Interent.  \n\n7) Bitcoin\'s rate of user adoption (as measured by wallets and transactions) exceeds that of even the Internet.  In the late 1980\'s, long after Al Gore invented it, few on earth even knew want the Internet was, and few of those who did thought that it would amount to much.  Bitcoin is today where the Internet was in the early 1990\'s. \n\n8). If current rates of user adoption hold, my calculation of Bitcoin\'s "value" in coming years (using the n log(n) metric), assuming current adoption trends hold, is as follows:\n\nDec 2015 $1,000\nDec 2016 $3,000\nDec 2018 $25,000\nDec 2020 $200,000\n\nMy calculations assume 400,000 unique daily users (on and off chain) today, growing to 100 million UDUsby Dec 2020.  \n\n 9) However, value and price are two separate things.  Use value, which is what network valuation metrics are based upon, is determined by the usability of the network today.  Price is based upon discounted assumptions of the status and usefulness of the network in the FUTURE, combined with current levels of liquidity.  \n\n10) Both the discount rate and liquidity are functions of knowledge and uncertainty.  Given that Bitcoin is a novel invention known and understood by very few, that it currently operates in beta, and that it considered unproven even by some who know of it, the discount rate applied is very high and constantly changing and liquidity is quite low.  Hence price is volatile and won\'t agree to the calculated value at any given moment. However, over the mid and long term, the two invariably converge. \n\n11). Baring something coming along that is 10X better than Bitcoin at fulfilling Bitcoin\'s value proposition, the Bitcoin network will continue to grow immensely and its value/price will too.  But predicting price at any given moment is impossible. \n\n\n': 1, "That's happened several times though": 4, '"The next bubble" just peaked on July 12.  \n\nMaybe you should ask [this guy](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/22ilu9/barry_silbert_at_inside_bitcoins_conference_i/).\n': -4, "The US is also exceeding the debt ceiling currently, but everyone has forgotten.

They adopted various methods to slow its adoption, including fud in the mainstream media, agents provocateurs to make Bitcoin look scary, regulatory uncertainty, high profile selective prosecutions of Bitcoin entrepreneurs, and dirty tricks using intelligence operatives and undercover law enforcement agents. They infiltrated, coopted, discredited, and neutered the Bitcoin Foundation. They duped Ross into handing over SR to an intel agency operative, who then (as DPR) ran it as a honeypot but also as a psy-op to discredit both MtGox and Bitcoin, as primarily being used by criminals for illegal drugs and money laundering. They confiscated MtGox funds and likely infiltrated and sabotaged its operations, culminating in either stealing MK's cold storage private keys or rendering them inaccessible to him. Alternatively, perhaps they simply threatened him with prosecution if he didn't hand them over and shut up. I think the investigator DY was working earnestly, but accidentally unraveled an ongoing undercover operation to frame MK (and Ashley Barr, who says he isn't an operative) as DPR. So DY had to be stopped and a new patsy was chosen to take the fall as DPR: Ross, who was appealing because of his earlier involvement in SR. Evidence was planted on Ross's laptop by hacking it, incriminating him as the one and only DPR. The Shrem and SR prosecutions have dovetailed with BitLicense hearings and finalization.

We can derive them and get to the same extended public keys:\n\n        > xprivKey.derive(5).xpubkey\n        \'xpub68RxTHwab4VhKaZMaKQnWfgSoZcwXGSgpV4GEJeBW7BBHimo5KWq16N3dsR4ztVa2g4meVLaFqbrGd8hKR2ASpgiZtAUg5nooSHSUGW2baU\'\n        > xpubKey.derive(5).xpubkey\n        \'xpub68RxTHwab4VhKaZMaKQnWfgSoZcwXGSgpV4GEJeBW7BBHimo5KWq16N3dsR4ztVa2g4meVLaFqbrGd8hKR2ASpgiZtAUg5nooSHSUGW2baU\'\n        > xprivKey.derive(5).xpubkey === xpubKey.derive(5).xpubkey\n        true\n\nyes, they are the same.\n\n(Of course there is no such thing as `xpubKey.xprivkey`. Trying to code using this, will quickly give you an error. I say that, because something else does not give you an error but rather gives you plausible looking objects ;) )\n\nNow, what does hardening do? I find the bitcore library very sneaky in this respect, as it [simply ignores the second parameter for extended public keys](https://github.com/bitpay/bitcore/blob/master/lib/hdpublickey.js#L113), so instead of throwing an error here, it happily derives to the non-hardened key but I understand that people who don\'t know crypto, should not use those libs anyway, but maybe, just maybe they will have a second thought, if a guy who wrote a 300 pages book on the topic, including on HD wallets, has no clue, which I would not blame him for, as I myself had to go very public to have somebody point me to what\'s going on. But enough of that, here is where hardening makes a difference:\n\n        > xprivKey.derive(5, true).xpubkey\n        \'xpub68RxTHwivj2fVVct3TYatDbi9yPSAcyUnrz3pvacZJRJXmzJiJVhL2g398iRRkdF8ii7SGPzXWpRWrvTWD6eL7sKV7LJLGSnB4ukDJg4eLb\'\n        > xpubKey.derive(5, true).xpubkey\n        \'xpub68RxTHwab4VhKaZMaKQnWfgSoZcwXGSgpV4GEJeBW7BBHimo5KWq16N3dsR4ztVa2g4meVLaFqbrGd8hKR2ASpgiZtAUg5nooSHSUGW2baU\'\n        > xprivKey.derive(5, true).xpubkey === xpubKey.derive(5, true).xpubkey\n        false\n\nSo in conclusion, you can not derive to a hardened key if you only have the HDPublicKey. You can only get there, if you know the HDPrivateKey. On the other hand, having either of those keys, allows you to derive further keys from it. I assume you can\'t tell from looking at an extended private or public key, if it\'s hardened or not.': 9, 'What if there was an alternative way that was just as secure but didnt have the costs of mining?': 2, 'Privacy should be the default mode of operation, not a half-baked afterthought that 99% of people never use... ie coinjoin.\n': 2, "excellent post man.

Also from [this site](http://bitcoinexchangerate.org/fees) and from [statoshi.org](http://statoshi.info/dashboard/db/transactions?from=1437868385070&to=1438473185071).  Beware that the "transactions accepted" of the latter are transactions that got into the blockchain, not into the queue.': 1, 'Actually during the last stress test the network was handling 400+ tx per second for a brief moment. \n\nIt just takes longer for those transactions to get included in the blockchain.  ': 1, 'I asume that people who need to do urgent transactions will pay a fee that makes sure the transaction will be processed imidiately. People who can wait with their transactions will schedule them for when the load on the network is low. Im sure it will be trivial to figure out at what time of the day when it is the smartest (cheapest) to do a blockchain transaction, and to automate/schedule the transaction/transactions for then.\n\nOther than that, as the blocks fill up off-chain solutions will be pursued more. These are the things i think is going to happen. Thank you.': 2, 'The estimate of 7 tx/s assumes that all blocks are filled to the maximum size (1 MB) and the transactions are only ~240 bytes.  However, the miners often output blocks that are empty or less than 1 MB in size; and the average transaction is much bigger, around 530 bytes.\n\nIn normal conditions, the actual capacity C of the bitcoin network (the maximum traffic that it can process continuously) seems to be about 106 MB/day, or 1.23 kB/s.  Assuming 540 bytes per transaction, on average, that would be about 200\'000 tx/day, or a bit less than 2.3 tx/s. \n\nRight now there is still a large backlog of transactions mostly created by the last stress test, and the transactions are bigger than normal, about 735 bytes on average.  Thus the network\'s capacity now is only 145\'000 tx/day, or 1.68 tx/s.  That is what the miners are processing now, when there is a backlog of entries that are paying a reasonable fee (0.2 mBTC/kB).  \n\nThe normal load N, when there is no stress tests or spam attacks going on and no backlogs, is about 120\'000 tx/day or 1.39 tx/s on average, which is 64 MB/day or 0.74 kB/s.  Thus the normal traffic is already 65% of the capacity.  \n\nSince Jul/2014, the norla load N has been growing at about 5000 tx/day per month.  (Although that growth appears to be fake, or at least not related to e-payments, because it is not matched by a growth in the total USD volume transacted per day.)\n\nThe load is not uniform during the day or the week.  As long as the load is well below the capacity, most transactions will get their first confirmation in the next  non-empty block, as long as they pay the minimum fee.  Paying more than that will not necessarily buy faster service.  This was the situation until a month or so ago, before the current epidemic of stress tests.\n\nOn the other hand, when the load N gets close enough to the capacity C, say 75-80%, there will begin to occur frequent "traffic jams"  during peak days and hours, when N temporarily exceeds C.  The queues then get bigger than one blockful, and will keep growing for as long as  N exceeds C, at the rate N - C kB/s.  Once the traffic surge abates and N drops again below C, the backlog will start to be cleared, at the rate of C - N kB/s.   \n\nFor example, right now there is a backlog of about 30 MB left over from the stress test, that is being cleared at the rate of 1.23 - 0.74 = .49 kB/s.  At this rate, the backlog will take another 17 hours to be processed.\n\nThus, while there is a backlog of unconfirmed transactions waiting on the queues, a transaction will take much longer (hours) to confirm, on average, than the usual 10-15 min. \n\nWhen there is a backlog, some clients who are aware of it and cannot wait for it to clear will start paying more than the minimum fee.  That will usually move their transactions to the front of the queue.  (The jargon term for it is "the fee market", although it will not be a functional market at all.)\n\nHowever, no matter what fees the clients pay, the time to the first confirmation, averaged over all transactions that are issued during it, will not change by a single second.  In particular, every time a client jumps the queue and secures a place in the next block, some other client will be pushed out of it.  Thus, inevitably, many clients will end up paying a lot more, only to wait much longer...\n\nA network whose load is greater than its capacity is a broken network.  It is a street with hour-long  car jams at rush hours, a sewer pipe that cannot carry all the sewage that it collects, a supermarket that takes in 20 customers in per minute but can only handle 2 per minute at the cashier.

Mara was about to sit down to a meal when the jailer called out his name.\n\n>Mr. Mara, 32 and Connecticut-born, says he then made a horrible mistake: he opened his eyes and looked up. That apparently broke a rule that before eating, each inmate should close his eyes and look downward.\n\n>And so, Mr. Mara\'s lawyers say, he was kept in solitary confinement for 10 days. There, they say, he was accused of "throwing books" and was stripped and restrained by a wide, thick leather belt around his waist, with both hands bound in steel-and-leather cuffs behind his back.\n\n>Mr. Mara spent 20 hours this way and was forced to lap up food from a bowl while lying prone on the floor.\n\n>In many ways, Japan\'s prison system is impressive. Overcrowding is not a problem, assaults or rapes among prisoners are rare, drugs and weapons are virtually nonexistent within prison walls, hardly anyone escapes and Japan has an exceptionally small proportion of its population in prison.\n\n>The problem, human rights campaigners say, is that the Japanese system achieves this record in part by draconian rules and mind-boggling regimentation.\n\n>"It smacks of totalitarianism," said Joanne Mariner, a prison specialist for Human Rights Watch, a New York-based human rights organization. "There\'s an obsession with rules and with absolute, strict obedience to rules. When they believe rules have not been followed, then there is arbitrary punishment."\n\n>Yuichi Kaido, Mr. Mara\'s lawyer, described it this way: "In the 19th century in the United States, it is said that the American prisoners were regarded as \'slaves of the state.\' I think those words fit the present situation of Japanese prisons to some extent."\n\n>Now a growing number of former prisoners, as well as prisoners still serving time, are putting the spotlight on conditions by trying to sue the prison system for mistreatment. Mr. Mara, who is serving a four-and-a-half-year term for smuggling more than 25 pounds of marijuana into Japan, filed a suit last week asking for about $90,000 in damages. He is believed to be the first American to sue the Japanese prison authorities.\n\n>Japanese prisoners are planning suits as well, and there are now an estimated 125 lawsuits in the courts.\n\n>Mr. Mara\'s case seems to be unusual. Most prisoners follow the rules scrupulously, partly because of what happens to those who resist, said Toshikuni Murai, dean of the law department at Hitotsubashi University. As a result, many are released early on parole for good behavior.\n\n>But Mr. Murai, who has visited prisons in China, South Korea, Europe and the United States, says discipline in Japanese prisons is the strictest he has seen.\n\n>"In Japan," he said, "some prisons have no walls, just bamboo fences, and all the prisons have no armed guards with guns. But inside, inmates have no right to an appeals system, and they don\'t have the right to conversation on the job."\n\n>Japanese officials say prison conditions are not as bad as human rights organizations suggest. They acknowledge that rules are strict, but they emphasize that this is an effort to build discipline and teach inmates the importance of obeying society\'s rules so they will not get in trouble again.\n\n>Moreover, the strictness of the rules means that there is no chance for gangs to develop in Japanese prisons. And while inmates may be subject to the whim of guards, they are unlikely to be brutalized by other inmates.\n\n>To be sure, fights among inmates do happen, as Takashi Akemitsu can attest. Mr. Akemitsu, 69, who has spent nearly four decades in different prisons in Japan, was first jailed for theft and later killed another inmate in a fight.\n\n>On another occasion when Mr. Akemitsu got into a fight with an inmate, jailers rushed him to a "protection cell," where he was harnessed by a copper-plated leather belt with his hands cuffed to the belt.\n\n>"At night they came in and offered me a meal of rice and miso soup," said Mr. Akemitsu, who was released in May. "They helped me eat and drink, and then they tightened the belt further. I almost suffocated, and I vomited.\n\n>"They pushed on my back again, tightened the belt more and locked it. I thought they would kill me."\n\n>Mr. Akemitsu, who is planning a suit against prison authorities, said the jail was run like a military outfit. But he said he and his cellmates could still speak freely, play chess, write letters or read books during their free time.\n\n>Research by the Japan Federation of Bar Associations has found that prisoners can be punished for "looking around," "speaking without permission" or wiping away sweat without permission. When punished with solitary confinement, prisoners are sometimes forced to sit motionless for hours.\n\n>An official from the Justice Ministry, which oversees prisons, declined to comment on prison conditions or specific cases.

At the beginning of bitcoin, you could use a CPU to do it, but as it got more competitive miners needed more horsepower and started using GPU's. Then that became non-viable and specialized, very powerful hardware called ASICS came online. That's basically where we are today.\n\nAlthough you don't have to do mining, the network would not function unless *some* people do it. Miners are essentially volunteers who do this work, and they are incentivized by the chance for a payout in bitcoin. Mining is necessary to secure the network since it is decentralized and there is no single authority to guarantee its integrity. \n\nThat's the cool thing about the bitcoin network.

Minting by miners is a cool trick Satoshi came up with to make the initial distribution reasonable enough while incentivizing early adoption.\n\nSo the word "mining" misses both the fact you mentioned, and the above, which I think are more interesting and essential than coin distribution.\n\nThis lead most people, including economists like Krugman, to think that the only reason computational power is being used is to make it hard to issue coins. People who understand Bitcoin use the word "waste" much more cautiously.\n': 1, "Likewise, the contrary seems clear to me. :-)\n\nI can't come up with one right now, but there must be other ways for initial distribution than centralized issuance (pre-mine, n coins per citizen, etc.).\n\nFor instance, if someone invented a way to make it sybil resistant (most likely impossible), nodes could be continuously rewarded for the amount of data they store and transactions they relay. You could then have the coins issued this way and let miners be supported by fees. (Then again, nodes would be called miners I guess.)\n\nAnyway, thanks for the debate. I'll have to think about this a bit more.\n": 1, 'Mining is just a way to make sure that someone around the world is selected at random to verify the ledger and recent transactions in exchange for receiving new coins that enter the ecosystem.

Just like the cost and difficulty of mining is what keeps gold scarce despite there being massive quantities of the stuff in earths crust and oceans. It was thinking about how to take hashcash, proof that you spent scarce resources, and turn it into something you could trade that likely lead to the bitcoin idea. Szabo for instance rightly recognized that every form of money from wampum to the giant stones of yap, all represented large amounts of "wasted" effort. But it\'s not really wasted just because you can\'t consume it, it becomes valuable over and over again every time a mutually profitable trade is facilitated. The effort is incredibly valuable as evidence the token is and will remain scarce.': 1, 'At it heart, mining is a game. Sort of like Magic The Gathering or baseball. The result of this game being played is the creation of this thing called the blockchain. Sort of like how the result of a baseball being played results in a [score card](http://www.baseballscorecard.com/scorecards/101799atlanta.jpg). A baseball score card is used to archive what happened in a baseball game. A blockchain is used to record economic activity that makes up the currency. Each baseball game is composed of 9 innings, but bitcoin mining is composed of one "mining round" that lasts every 10 minutes. Each mining round results in a winner, who gets a 25 BTC award, and the privilege of determining what gets written next to the blockchain.\n\nIt has to take 10 minutes of heavy computation in order for the game to work properly. Think of the game hide and go seek. One person closes their eyes and counts to 100 while everyone else goes and hides. If the person counting counts very fast, then by the time they go looking for the other players, they may not have finished hiding yet. The counter has to count slowly enough in order for the game to work. In bitcoin mining, each round has to last 10 minutes or else every block will get solved immediately. The "difficulty" mechanism ensures that it takes 10 minutes for each round. You can\'t just tell players to "wait to minutes between rounds" because there is no way to enforce that rule. Imagine a hide and seek game where instead of counting to 100, the person does 100 seconds of math problems.\n\nAs long as the game is being played, the blockchain will continue to exist, and the bitcoin currency can use it to be a currency. If the bitcoin game stops, that is to say everyone on the planet decided that mining is not something they want to do anymore, then bitcoin will end. As long as their are some people playing the game, the currency will continue.\n\nAll it takes to be a player in the mining game is to install the bitcoin mining software on a computer you own. ': 1, '> if bitcoins were distributed in a completely different manner, proof of work would still serve the same role\n\nI enjoy a good debate, and you\'re making excellent intelligent points, but let me counter:\n\nThe role of proof-of-work is first and foremost the distribution of bitcoins. I\'ll concede that if you ignore economic incentives, you could theoretically have 100% pre-mine, and the system could function with mining used only for transaction ordering consensus, but in the real world with real economic incentives it wouldn\'t work. We can\'t know without asking satoshi, but it seems clear to me that proof-of-work was seen first as a way to simulate the "wasted" effort needed for something to be produced while still remaining scarce, like wampum or gold, or giant carved stones. Using it to also achieve consensus on transfers in addition to the initial production of the units in question is genius, but surely was an idea that came after.': 1, 'Bitcoin is a fully decentralized system. Like BitTorrent, for instance, but more so.\n\nThere are no gatekeepers or administrators to authenticate, approve, filter, censor, etc. It is a fully open system with no pre-defined social hierarchy.\n\nSince it is impossible to physically protect Bitcoin from attackers within and without, it needs something irreproducible to accompany blocks of transactions in its distributed database. It uses proof of computational work as that irreproducible thing, since it can be communicated only with numbers. This protects the transaction history from being manipulated.\n\nTo incentivize the computational work, those who produce them (who are called miners, a very bad analogy) are rewarded through newly issued currency (bitcoins) and transaction fees.\n\nAs for profits, GPU mining era is now left far behind, and application specific devices are being used.\n': 3, '[Getting Started](https://bitcoin.org/en/getting-started)': 1, 'Mining in bitcoin serves 3 purposes\n1. verifying and confirming the transaction\n2. distribution of initial bitcoins\n3. agree on a consensus among decentralized nodes.\n\nnowaday, gtx 760 does not profit from mining.  asic built specific for mining outperforms gtx 760 a lot.  by more than 2 order of magnitudes.': 1, '> Making coins hard to issue really is the main point of proof of work.\n\nIf you mean that the issue itself is the important part, I disagree.
