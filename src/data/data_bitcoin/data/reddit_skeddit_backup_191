Nothing and nowhere in his speeches said about cost or fee of BTC transactions. Andreas says that you can spend 1 pound on sending money to 50 people. Or sending money to buy 50 products to test out Bitcoin (even though its going to be mostly cheap or almost free digital products like games, playing casino for 1 cent, or watching 1 video).\n\nConcerning fee, in Bitcoin you pay around 1 cent for each transaction. Its not measured in %. Its measured by fixed price. Which means that you can pay 1 cent to transfer $1000 dollars which is something like 0.01% fee. Transferring anything less than $1000, then complaining for paying 1 cent is idiocy and laziness.

In few months, the reward will halve to 12.5. The halving happens every few years, as specified by the protocol, so eventually "miners" will be relying on fees as main source of income, and some sort of fee market will emerge.\n\nServices such as Coinbase may choose to cover (or hide from the user) the fees, or they might offer the user to choose.': 3, 'If you send a small transaction, the network might consider it as spam.

Without seizing it, it would have gone under, and it was too big to fail. Iceland also put in place a variety of capital controls and restrictions on what banks could do, in order to to prevent the bank crisis from getting worse. Anyway, now that things have stabilized, Iceland is requiring its banks to pay a ["stability tax,"](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-04-13/iceland-seeks-to-impose-stability-tax-on-failed-banks-by-june) ([see also](http://www.ey.com/GL/en/Services/Tax/International-Tax/Alert--Iceland-announces-strategy-to-remove-capital-controls-and-introduces-a-stability-tax)) in order for them to resume normal business, no longer subject to the crisis-era regulations.

This was apparently acceptable to the authorities, who may or may not turn around and sell that 95% ownership stake, returning the proceeds to taxpayers.\n\nFor a contrasting approach, the US still owns Fannie and Freddie (technically the Fed, but who is counting), and the proceeds from those firms have been sent to the Treasury since 2008. Thanks to the subsequent recovery, F+F have repaid all their bailout funds and have actually [turned a profit](http://www.marketwatch.com/story/after-earning-billions-in-profits-fannie-freddie-reform-further-than-ever-2015-08-10) for the government.

"Shares" is a strong word here, because when we think of shares we think of shareholders, which implies some form of governance. They don\'t get voting rights as a result of owning shares. The banks do get to elect 1/3 of the people on the district-level boards, but the other 2/3 are appointed politically. The shares themselves are non-transferable, meaning they can\'t be sold, traded, or borrowed against. They\'re not "shares" in the sense that we think of owning shares in say IBM.\n\nBasically the shares are a way to compensate the banks for keeping cash on call at the Fed. Before the Fed existed, banks would park their reserves in government bonds or in other banks up the financial chain, earning interest each time. The law requires that banks keep a certain percentage of their money on deposit at the fed in case of a bank run, and it is only fair that the banks be compensated for that. \n\nThe dividend was originally offered as a carrot to entice banks to join the Federal Reserve System. The banks didn\'t like the Fed as originally proposed and had their own designs they liked better (they gave the banks more influence). It was feared that, by making participation mandatory, banks would simply re-charter as state banks, rendering them immune from Federal law, which only applies to interstate commerce. The dividend was offered to buy their political support.\n\nFor what it\'s worth, Congress just cut the dividend from 6% to 1.5% in order to pay for a highway bill, and I think that\'s pretty reasonable. You could make the case that it should be lower.\n\nAnyway the reason the shares exist is to compensate banks for parking their cash at the Fed, instead of someplace else.': 2, 'Why not just pay their bloated management less?': 1, 'Ice floe.': 5, 'The same government that jailed the bankers and gave money back to the population?

The Jekyll Island bill died when it was brought into Congress, and while the final FRA was influenced by it, it was written by different people aiming to please political constituencies. And in any event, the Jekyll Island proposal was but one of many. There were at least three separate bills being proposed in 1912-1913, all of which were trying to set something like the Fed up. Bryan especially played renegade, sinking the Jeykll Island bill while supporting others and throwing wrenches in the political process until Wilson finally gained his acquiescence by agreeing to put "US obligations" on the final dollar designs. All of those bills influenced the final product.\n\nThe eventual FRA was debated in Congress for something like five months. It was almost replaced several times. It was passed by the House, and then passed by the Senate something like two months later, after extensive politicking and deal making made it possible. It was hardly something written by a banker in secret and then signed in secret by a President ashamed of his actions. It was a law, like any other. In fact the bankers association didn\'t even like it, and they tried to get it changed to be more in their favor multiple times (Wilson eventually overcame their resistance). \n\nAs for Lowenstein, I fail to see how being a hedge fund manager would make him pro- Fed?

I know Treasury is subject to the same GAO and Congressional oversight that all other federal agencies are subject to. The Fed releases its statements too, and they are subject to Congressional oversight as well. I don\'t know if they are subject to the GAO though.\n\nThere is a movement afoot to audit the Fed on a regular basis - thanks to Ron Paul\'s agitations - but the Fed has fought against that, and there\'s some logic to their position. The issue is how you do the actual accounting, because the Fed owns a lot of long-term debt now thanks to QE, TARP, and the bailouts. It intends to hold all of those assets to maturity, meaning it will never sell the bonds but will instead just sit and collect the interest payments until the principal gets repaid. The biggest threat to the Fed\'s balance sheet isn\'t the things on it, but is instead long-term inflation, all things being equal. But even then, given that they\'re collecting interest payments on nearly everything they own, that risk is lessened.\n\nOn the accounting side - Most businesses and financial firms use what\'s called "mark to market" accounting, meaning they value their assets at their present-day value, as if they were to sell the assets today. M2M has its benefits and drawbacks. For banks, who might conceivably have to unload lots of assets in the event of a run on the bank, this is a decent estimate of how much capital they can reasonably expect to call upon. It can also be used to inflate earnings, a la Enron, but that\'s another post. However, M2M is especially problematic for the types of assets the Fed owns - long-term debt that it has no intention of selling. Mark-to-market accounting would make the Fed\'s balance sheet seem precarious, because in order to sell those bonds on the open market, they\'d have to sell a lot of them at a loss. However, since the Fed intends to hold them until maturity, this is a non-issue.\n\nAnyway, the audit the Fed thing would have the outcome of creating a terrifying balance sheet showing the Fed as massively over-indebted, hopelessly beyond its ability to repay. Given that they intend to hold their assets to maturity, they\'re really not in that trouble. But a regular audit, using conventional accounting methods, is incapable of seeing that. \n\nThis question also touches on the idea of central bank independence - something I wrote my master\'s thesis on, incidentally - but I\'ll save that for another day. This post is long enough already.': 3, "The Fed remits all profits, after paying dividends, to the Treasury.

If you're interested in knowing about why the shares exist and more about the ownership of the Fed, I can type that up, but will wait to see if you are interested or not.\n\nThe Fed is not technically a government entity, but it functions that way for all intents and purposes. Its governors are political appointees. It responds to political pressures (see: bailouts). It was created and continues to exist because of the Federal Reserve Act; like most GSE's, it doesn't exist because market forces created it, but it exists instead because laws brought it into being. The Fed is a GSE in all but the technical sense.\n\nAnyway, in the event of Fannie and Freddie specifically, the numbers on them returning a profit to the Treasury are easily google-able, and I will leave you to do your own research.": 17, "Well, they didn't give them bonuses like every where else, nor let them stay at their positions.

Their fluctuating faith also represents price changes.\n\nThe thing that you will notice is that the exact same thing will happen if I pick any other \'backing\' commodity: like gold, or sugar, or silver, or even bitcoins.  Literally any currency \'backing\' will *always* have voilatility equal to the amount that people desire the backed goods, and the amount that people can use the backed goods, times the faith that the market has that the backing will be worth something in the future to other actors.\n\nIn fact, that\'s basically all the USD *is*:  There\'s a market-based perception of how much all the items in the entire market cost in USD, that represents the \'value\' of the commodity basket that \'backs\' the USD.   To put it another way, the USD is a commodity basket currency already, where the commodity basket in question is literally every good or service available on the market, multiplied times the faith that the US government won\'t collapse.\n\nTl:Dr; there\'s no such thing as a price index that means anything.': 1}, ('The Mycelium card seems to be getting closer to a reality.', 52): {'Thanks missed that...': 1, 'You can use bitcoin or fiat with the card.
