Which measurements would we use to identify and what is the best practice to react?\n\n>A big deal for sure, do we have measurements for that? What solutions are being discussed?\n\nIt's mostly about burst capacity when it comes to block verification. The main issue is cutting down the time it takes to flood the network with the new block. Faster verification -> faster block propagation.\n\nSegwit will enable some optimizations here in the future, but I don't think that those are available in the initial version. There was talk of graceful degradation of verification where a node could ramp down the segwit verification based on performance. If the witness data that's verified is chosen randomly, then the chance of an invalid block propagating successfully is very low, especially if a node that detects a violation broadcasts compact fraud proofs. (proofs that are easy to verify that prove that a block / transaction is invalid). I'm not entirely clear on the details of the above. It was mentioned in passing as a future expansion, and was light on details.\n\nEdit: I should add that there are other proposals being worked on. [Invertible bloom lookup tables](http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~michaelm/E210/IBLT.pdf) [PDF] is one such a proposal.

It doesn't address any of the performance issues i described above (in fact, it makes it worse) and it only adds more storage, nothing else. Segregated Witness adds a host of functionality, and the capacity increase is a *byproduct*. A much better solution in my opinion.": 2, 'https://blockchain.info/charts/avg-block-size': 4, "> Where are our thresholds for performance degradation? I would guess this has normative operating boundaries (green) with peaks (yellow, acceptable) and spikes (red) thresholds.\n\nThere have been some periods when block size was redlining, all of which were manufactured through transaction spam. Real economic activity is much lower than what you see here. \n\nCompare the [number of transactions](https://blockchain.info/charts/n-transactions) with the [number of transactions excluding chains longer than 10 transactions to/from the same address](https://blockchain.info/charts/n-transactions-excluding-chains-longer-than-10?showDataPoints=false&timespan=&show_header=true&daysAverageString=7&scale=0&address=). \n\nThe subtext from blockchain.info on long chains: \n\n> A chart showing the total number of bitcoin transactions per day excluding those part of long chain transaction chains. There are many legitimate reasons to create long transaction chains however they may also be caused by coin mixing or possible attempts to manipulate transaction volume.\n\n\n.\n> When do we respond with increased processing (adjust #of miners)\n\nNot sure what you mean here. Bitcoin miners are independent entities. There is no central planning in Bitcoin that adds / removes miners. They are financially incentivized to mine. More is better, but it doesn't make transaction throughput go faster.\n\n>  when do we respond to network latency (adjust regional processing, if even an option)\n\nNetwork latency is actually the biggest bottleneck in Bitcoin right now. It has an immediate effect on the miners' bottom line. Stale blocks are wasted effort and any kind of increase in latency has a direct effect on block stale rate. Miners have tried solving this themselves to disastrous effect, mining on top of blocks of others without validating them. \n\nSolving the latency problem is one of the #1 things that has to be addressed before capacity can be increased or we start losing network security (more stale blocks -> more wasted effort -> hashing power not being used to protect the main chain) and loss of miner income (incentivizing them to do dangerous things again). Edit: on top of that, node count will go down due to higher resource demand, and it has a centralizing pressure on mining. All bad things.\n\n> and when do we respond to block size (adjust block, up or down)?\n\nBlock size is a means to an end. The ultimate goal is increased *capacity*, through whichever means is best. Right now Segregated Witness is the prime contender for this, simply because it has a capacity increase as a side effect. Its primary features alone are also worth the effort to have it, even if it didn't offer a capacity increase.\n\nThose features are:\n\n- fixing transaction malleability.\n\n- all future script upgrades are now soft forks, allowing faster and easier deployments of new features.\n\n- it makes it easier for hardware wallets to generate new transactions, especially with large input transactions.\n\n- it offers fraud proofs. SPV wallets can now check if what they receive is correct, without downloading the whole chain.\n\n- it lowers storage requirements for nodes. They can delete the segwit data after a while and still keep the block.\n\n- and last but not least, there's room for more transactions in the block. \n": 5, "I suspect, though, that complete validation is not required for Bitcoin to be usefully trustless.\n\nJust as the probability of a transaction's truth increases the longer that the transaction is in the blockchain, the probability of a blockchain's truth increases the more of it you verify.\n\nSurely, there is some subset of the blockchain (perhaps coupled with other data, such as historic difficulty levels) that, if verified, means it's highly likely to offer the correct tip of the chain (or, more generally, highly likely to offer enough cryptographic structure with which to verify that some other set of data was in fact placed in the desired blockchain).\n\nIn particular, maybe the onus of storing any particular piece of the blockchain could be pushed onto the people who actually care about being able to prove said piece is part of the complete blockchain.

If they do take this action, I would advocate that they do a **Omnibus hardfork** and put all the "wishlist" stuff they can agree on.\n* Some devs (not sure how many) see the "writing on the wall" by continuing to use the same PoW for an extended period of time.

The first time, after I\'d become a verified member, I used my card to buy bitcoins instantly and paid a little extra for this, 2.75%.  The page said that "This transaction may take **a few seconds** to complete" (emphasis mine) and **48 hours later** I had my bitcoins.
