I thought a BIP is supposed to give a clear overall solution, isn\'t it? Quote from BIP-0001 general guideline on BIPs: *"The specification should be detailed enough to allow competing, interoperable implementations for any of the current Bitcoin platforms"*\n\nThis "BIP106" is much too vague. It is not clear what BIP106 wants. Does it want either "proposal 1" or "proposal 2" within this "BIP106" to be implemented? Or does it propose to combine both proposals? If yes, in what way??\n\n----\n\n**(2)** About "proposal 1" within this BIP: I think the concrete idea is not well thought through. Waiting until 50% of blocks are more than 90% filled before increasing the block size limit appears arbitrary to me, and a bit too late, the network would already show significant signs of congestion at that point. And then, when MaxBlockSize gets adapted, it is immediately doubled - i.e. first waiting very long doing nothing, and then doubling it in one step. Such big adjustments steps are unhealthy and not stable.\n\nEven worse is the condition for reducing block size: If >90% are less then 50% filled, MaxBlockSizeLimit is halfed. This again is a much too large adaptation step and can cause huge congestions immediately. Example: If 90% are filled by 49% and 10% of blocks are filled 100%, then average blocks are filled by 54.1%. This BIP would HALF the MaxBlockSize limit under such situation, thereby immediately causing a system breakdown for the next two weeks! This does not look like a good design to me.\n\nMoreover, it is not clear why only 2000 out of 2016 blocks are considered, i.e. why systematically 16 out of 2016 blocks arbitrarily are not considered at all.\n\n----\n\n**(3)** About "proposal 2" within this BIP: In my own words, this proposal says:\n\nIf last 4016 blocks are >50% filled AND if both TX fees and the actual block sizes have increased within the last 4016 blocks (by comparing 1st with 2nd part of these 4016 blocks), then MaxBlockSize gets increased by a factor that is the ratio of the actual block sizes of the two parts of the last 4016 blocks.\n\nOtherwise,\n\nIf last 4016 blocks are <50% filled AND if both TX fees and the actual block sizes have decreased within the last 4016 blocks (by comparing 1st with 2nd part of these 4016 blocks), then MaxBlockSize gets decreased by a factor that is the ratio of the actual block sizes of the two parts of the last 4016 blocks.\n\nThis scheme is somewhat interesting, but not well thought through. One point of criticism is that it leaves a crucial component out of the equation, namely the BTC exchange rate. The question how TX fees have changed from one 2008-bocks period to the next 2008-blocks period is not only given by measuring the TX fees in BTC units. If BTC exchange rate has changed in the meantime, the actual fees may have changed despite being nominally the same when measured in BTC units.\n\nSecondly, the criteria for increasing and decreasing are quite arbitrarily mixed together and do not make much sense. Under the given rules one could well construct a scenario where TX fees and actual block size increase monotonically over many weeks, but the criterion for increasing MaxBlockSize limit is not met, because never all of the 3 conditions are met simultaneously.

They express the concern that this anticipated growth rate is hard-coded into BIP101, with even a little bit too much optimism, and this probably yields too high block size limits in the medium-to-long run. I tend to agree with this viewpoint (and my BIP proposes a solution to address this concern).\n\nThe BIP101 supporters usually give the correct pragmatical answer to this concern in saying that a too quick increase of block size limit in BIP101 does not actually harm, because it is just a *limit*, and not the *actual* block size.\n\nIn the beginning I also adopted this argument, but then I had to find out with some self-criticism that is is not entirely "honest": This answer is technically correct, but with this logic one could equally well abandon any block size limit altogether, arguing that also an infinite block size limit does not mean that actual block size will be infinite. So the fact that BIP101 *does* define a block size limit means that BIP101 proponents see some benefit of having such a limit in general, and I agree with that. But this self-contradicts the BIP101 proponents\' earlier argument that a too high block size limit does not harm.\n\nNote that only a small offset in prediction of technological evolution can cause huge difference between what would be a good block size limit at a future time "t0+delta" and what is the actual block size limit acc. to BIP101. For example, ...\n\n* if actual doubling of bandwidth and storage occurs every 2.5 years (=+32% p.a.), while BIP101 predicts a 2 years doubling speed (41% p.a.), then after 10 years the BIP101\'s block size limit would be twice as high as it "should" be. And after 20 years the mismatch is a factor of is 3.7.\n* If the actual doubling needs 3 years (+26% p.a.), the discrepancy with BIP101\'s limit becomes a factor of 3.1 or 9.5(!) after 10 or 20 years, respectively.\n* After all, there could even be some technological breakthroughs in the future, rendering BIP101\'s hard-coded growth rate too conservative. In this case, the protocol would offer no solution for increasing the limits faster.\n\nSo, there should be some further intelligence brought into the protocol to avoid that the block size limit is too far away from technological reality. This intelligence can only be a feedback from either actual Bitcoin usage (block occupancy), or information inserted by human. This BIP combines both of these approaches, while the latter is the "vote".\n\n**BIP101 proponents** should not have too little trust in miners "voting capabilities". It is likely that at least 51% of miners will vote reasonably in the long term. And(!), note that even if they don\'t: Thanks to this BIP\'s first constraint imposed by ACTUAL block size, block size limit *will* grow (before the network experiences mission critical congestion), even if miner votes are insane. So I as an originally BIP101 proponent, feel absolutely comfortable that this "BIP10X" will not disappoint original BIP101 proponents.\n\n----\n\n**BIP100 proponents** (especially many/most **mining pools** seem to sympathize with BIP100 currently) on the other hand should also be happy with this "BIP10X", because it lies in their hands to determine the general growth speed of Bitcoin, by determining block size limit evolution from a combination of actual block size and explicit voting. This way, they can even stretch the growth rate beyond "BIP101 speed" (but only with stable 80% majority), but they can also limit the growth speed. In general, the 51% idea lies behind these mechanisms, which should find more support amongst the miners than the BIP100 proposal which defines the 20% quantile as the vote that decides.\n\nBut not only can 20% minorities of miners block a needed moderate growth, they can even cause huge and fast fluctuations of block size limits over time. All this means instability and little planning security, which lies certainly NOT in the interest of the normal miner. Therefore I assume that miners, after careful study of this BIP10X and the consequences of BIP100, will be much more in favor of BIP10X.\n\n----\n\nTo summarize, I think the presented "BIP10X" has the potential to find support both amongst miners, as well as amongst BIP101 supporters.\n\n* I believe in support from miners and up-to-now-BIP100-proponents simply because there are compelling pragmatical economical reasons why miners should support BIP10X in favor of BIP100.\n\n* I also believe in support from the "BIP101 camp", because I assume they are in support of  BIP101 not because "101" is such a nice number, but they support BIP101 because the block size evolution mechanism should have certain positive traits (properties) and should lack certain negative properties, both in the interest of Bitcoin\'s prosperity, and in lack of other sound BIP proposals having been published, they decided to support BIP101 as the best match.\nAs a final argument towards "BIP101\'ers", I would like to point out an aspect in support of BIP10X that might otherwise be misunderstood: With BIP10X you do not need to be afraid that miner voting mechanism can cripple Bitcoin\'s usability and evolutionary growth. Because, if you carefully look how mechanisms and parameters of BIP10X are designed, you will find that this risk is practically not greater in BIP10X than in BIP101 itself! Yes, even in BIP101, "the miners" (as a hypothetical collective group) can "cripple" or "boycott" the system by simply generating rather empty blocks and letting the mem-pool grow indefinitely, while the block size limit would allow much larger blocks. Clearly the same could happen with BIP10X, but not much more than that. As soon as a substantial percentage of miners fills the blocks normally (thanks to constraint "(C-1)" about "actual block size"), the block size limit is bound to grow. So in either case, BIP101 and BIP10X, it is not easily possible to cripple the system, so robustness is quite similar in both BIPs! Hence, I expect BIP101 proponents to also be able to sympathize with this BIP10X.\n\n----\n\nTo summarize, I believe that this proposal has the potential to really find **wide range support** and solve the deadlock in the current discussion.\n\n*Disclaimer: I am a Bitcoin enthusiast since 2011 and am pursuing a normal and well-paid job in the classical non-Bitcoin industry (system design in telecommunications), plus I have a deep and purely private/scientific/non-ideological interest into macro-economics since the financial crisis of 2008. I have no political intentions whatsoever to push Bitcoin in one direction or the other, but I am just loving (and I still love) the beauty of this system. Therefore I want to do all I can to help Bitcoin grow, prosper and succeed, and this is my contribution to achieve this. Needless to say that it really cost me plenty of time.*': 11, 'A blocksize limit of 1MB is a subset of rules BIP101 nodes are already ok with.  51% of miners could impose this 1MB limit rule on the network by refusing to build on blocks over 1MB.\n\nStrictly speaking, BIP100 does not give miners more power to lower the limit compared to the current status quo 1MB or compared to BIP101.

As we scale up, that won't be possible any more. If there are millions of bitcoin transactions happening every second, that will be a great problem for BitCoin to have--means it is very popular, very trusted--but obviously I won't be able to run it on my own personal computer. It will take dedicated fleets of computers with high-speed network interfaces, and that kind of big iron to actually do all that transaction processing.

When deflation occurs it becomes less profitable to loan and more difficult to repay loans. This is because the real value of your money is increasing so any existing debts are becoming more expensive over time and any new loans need an outrageous interest rate to outpace the rising value of money. Our modern monetary system creates money when banks lend money, so if lending stalls, money creation stalls. If money creation stalls the rate of deflation increases, creating a vicious cycle. The deeper it gets, the more people default on their loans and the more bank balance sheets don\'t add up as more and more financial assets disappear into thin air. So deflation is bad for the banking system.\n\nThis has led many people to conclude that deflation is just "bad" in general, when in actuality it is just bad because of how the modern banking system works. Even within the context of the modern system deflation merely occurs when citizens are paying down their debts and choosing to save. Why is this intrinsically a bad thing? It is bad for the modern banking system, but perhaps that indicates there is something wrong with the current system, not that there is something wrong with saving and being financially responsible. \n\nThe inflation paradigm, the spending paradigm, benefits banks. It benefits banks in the same way lots of automobile use benefits gas and oil companies. It is in gas companies\' interests that people drive a lot. In the same way, it is in bankers interests that people borrow a lot; inflation guarantees that they will. Since banks essentially run the show, is it any wonder everyone has bought the narrative that inflation is inherently good? Of course they want us to believe that borrowing is the key to economic prosperity, that is how they gain their wealth and power! But in the same way the insane use of oil and gas is causing global warming, the insane amount of borrowing is causing massive levels of debt worldwide. It isn\'t sustainable.

But only at the first glance I am afraid.\n\nI do not even want to talk about those big adjustment steps by a factor of *2 or /2, which are quite coarse..., the main big concern of mine is this:\n\n**You can cripple / attack the Bitcoin system by maintaining the status quo!**\n\nA 21% minority (and apparently this even includes lazy non-voters who don\'t care setting up their miners to cast a vote) can prevent that block size limit increases, when it is urgently needed! Imagine that technology advances! A 1 MB in terms of storage or bandwidth today is maybe like 2 MB two years from now! So it would not be harmful to raise limit to 2 MB in 2017, this would not exclude more miners than today with 1 MB, hence it would not make the system more "decentralized" than today. In the meantime, hopefully also Bitcoin usage and traffic have naturally increased, hopefully, so an increase to 2 MB would really be needed.\n\nHowever, a 21% minority could block such increase forever and could therefore kill Bitcoin\'s value proposition - Bitcoins would become less and less useful than what it even was in 2015.\n\n----\n\nAnother point: When should the increase from 1 MB to 2 MB happen? Hmm, now in 2015 is too early. 2016? Perhaps. In 2017: Yes, at latest now would be the right time, because of the technological advances nobody would be "excluded" as compared to 2015. But wait, in the meantime, thanks to technological advances, other miners have joined during 2016/2017 which could not yet participate in 2015, because for their low bandwith connection even the 1MB was too much. But now the 1MB is ok, thanks to technological advances. But now, if raising limit from 1 MB to 2 MB, these miners would be excluded again. So these miners will vote to KEEP 1 MB limit even in 2017. The more you wait, the more you get low-bandwidth miners into the game, that will/may block bandwidth increase forever!\n\nResult: Bitcoin dies due to egoistic voting of (new!) low-bandwidth miners (which haven\'t been there 1 or 2 years before).\n\n----\n----\n\nAnother aspect: Voting for "no increase" is also a vote. So every block a miner can vote one out of 3 ways:\n\n* (D) decrease\n\n* (K) keep\n\n* (I) increase\n\nThe BIP100 says: For vote (D) or (I) a 80% majority is needed, while for a vote (K) a 20% majority is sufficient. This is a clear a-priori bias towards (K), which is not by nature in the best interest of Bitcoin - but the BIP100 does as if it knows that this is the case and will always be so.\n\nNow one could argue: Well, but if using the 50% quantile, then it would be like: Vote for (D) or (I) requires 50% majority, while (K) will rarely happen (only if the vote for (K) happens to be the median). So we will often have +100% / -50% changes. Is this good?\n\nAnswer: No, this is too disruptive. But this is only because BIP100 has defined such coarse adjustments steps like *2 or /2, but this is no god-given necessity. Also difficulty is not adjusted in such coarse steps. The whole system becomes much more graceful if block size change is decided upon much more often, while adjustment steps are accordingly smaller and less disruptive, like steps of 5% to 10% or so.': 7, ">Could you elaborate a bit on how important it is to run a full node for a pool?\n\nPool operators absolutely should run a full node. If they don't, then they can't include transactions in their blocks, and they lose out (currently) on about 1% of the available revenue. As block sizes increase and block subsidies decrease, that 1% will grow dramatically. For example, with 100 MB blocks and the current average fee of 8\xc2\xa2/kB, fees would be about $8k or 33 BTC per block. Miners can and will change pools over a 1% difference in revenue, much less a 2.5x difference.\n\nHowever, bandwidth costs per Mbit/s and per GB are much lower for pool operators, because they can run their servers in a datacenter in a major city near large bandwidth hubs, where bandwidth is much cheaper than in the remote farms near hydroelectric dams that miners prefer. On DigitalOcean's VPS, for example, I can get 2 TB/month at 1 Gbps peak for $10/month, which is about 10x the bandwidth that I get for 1/10th the price I pay.\n\nMany pools (including the big Chinese ones) use a hybrid system that combines SPV (header-only) mining with full-node mining. Immediately after they receive a block header, they start mining a new block on top of it but without any transactions included. In parallel, they download the transaction data for the block. Once the transaction data has been downloaded, they can switch to full-node mining and include transactions in the block they're trying to mine on top of it. This way, they get the best of both worlds: they have low orphan rates due to the SPV mining as soon as a block header is available, and they have the transaction fees once the full block has been downloaded. However, everyone has to deal with the bugs if they mine on an invalid chain, like with the BIP66 fork. The main cost of SPV mining is borne by the non-mining users of Bitcoin, which means that SPV mining is, in my opinion, evil.\n\nIn the future, once the block subsidy drops a few times and mining fees increase, SPV mining will likely become obsolete. The revenue from finding an empty block will not be enough to pay for the electricity used to mine it, so miners will idle their machines until they accumulate enough transactions to pay for the expected electricity cost of mining a block.": 4, "Yes, good point as well. But it seems to me that miners with more bandwidth have an incentive to increase the max block size which in turn causes Bitcoin to become more centralized. I don't like this incentive which is against the interest of Bitcoin in general.": 1, "I don't see why do you predict such controversy when most people are willing to discuss BIP 100 and a vast majority of Core and the miners don't want anything of BIP 101.\n\nPredicting controversy?
