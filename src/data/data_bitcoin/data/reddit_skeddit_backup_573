Is something "open" if it has *extremely* broad industry support, and anyone can support it with little extra cost? Apple Pay requires nothing proprietary from merchants to accept; they need only industry-standard POS terminals and an account with someone to process credit cards. If this is a "walled garden" then it\'s a garden big enough to contain almost the entirety of non-cash retail payments.

That level of control is not something any person or group of people can have without being corrupted by.\n\nI'm sure that Apple Pay is going to be accepted by a huge number of merchants.

When you add a card to Apple Pay the first time, the issue sends a token which is saved on your phone. Your card number is *not* on the phone. When you go to actually pay, only this token is given to the merchant. The merchant doesn't even know the difference, but crucially, this means they don't have it. This token, unlike your real card number, requires the dynamic security code that only your phone can generate and therefore *cannot* be used if stolen from the merchant. Merchants can't be trusted with credit card numbers and Apple Pay means they never get it.\n\n> Does Apple take an additional cut of the transaction above and beyond what Visa and Mastercard are getting?\n\nApple takes a tiny cut *from* the bank's portion.
