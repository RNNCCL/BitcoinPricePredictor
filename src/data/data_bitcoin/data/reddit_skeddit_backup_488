A private houshold could offer to sell electricity to cars parking in front of their private charging station. Payment can be pseudo-anonymously via bitcoin. Other use-cases...?\n\nProblem with this: The Bitcoin network capacity is much too low at present (1 MB max. block size).

Even if the price goes to exactly zero, surely there will be people mining for sentimental reasons.\n\nOn the other hand, if the price were to drop from the current ~200 $/BTC to ~20 $/BTC, the revenue of the miners as a whole would drop by 90%.  It is rumoured that most miners today have relatively narrow profit margins.  If that is the case, then about 80-90% of the mining equipment currently active would have to be shut down.  Miners who have yet to pay off their equipment may go bankrupt.\n\nIf the price drop happens gradually, the difficulty would automatcally adjust so that the block rate and confirmation delay would remain  practically the same.  There would be an increased risk of "majority attack": if 90% of today\'s hashpower is turned off, then anyone who owns, acquires, or hires 20% of that idle equipment could easily overwhelm the surviving 10%.\n\nIf 90% of the miners *suddenly* stopped mining, then the block rate would drop to 1 every 100 minutes.  Since the difficulty gets adjusted only every \xcb\x9c2000 blocks the next adjustment may come only 20 weeks later, instead of 2 weeks.  Moreover, the difficulty is adjusted at most by a factor of 4 each time, so that the block rate would still be 1 every 25 minutes for another 5 weeks.  Until the difficulty got adjusted, the total daily revenue available to miners would be reduced by 90%, on top of any reduction due to falling price.  Even if 90% of the miners closed shop, the revenue of the surviving miners would still be 90% less than before; so it could be that *almost all* of them go out of business, not .  I.e., a *sudden* drop of 90% in the price could cause a much larger drop in the total daily revenue of the miners, and therefore similar drop in the block rate.  Then presumably the price would fall even further, causing a chain reaction.': 1}, ('ELI5: How do sidechains work?', 40): {'Isnt the problem with this how does the Bitcoin blockchain check that the tokens on the sidechain are destroyed before bringing them back to BTC?

I doubt a 5 year old can understand this, but it\'s the best I can do:\n\nThink of sidechains as basically like a bitcoin bank, but operated by a blockchain instead of company. The sidechain can do anything it wants with the bitcoins it receives, but like any other bitcoin user, it can only "send back" what it has received. It makes sense for them to peg their sidechain tokens to bitcoin, but they don\'t *need* to.\n\nSidechains don\'t need to be proof-of-work, but there is no such thing as functional proof-of-stake, and proof-of-burn makes no sense in this context. The common alternative to proof-of-work would be a multisig/centralised blockchain where corporate entities sign off on each block.': 2, "They don't work.

": 6, '> Isnt the problem with this how does the Bitcoin blockchain check that the tokens on the sidechain are destroyed before bringing them back to BTC? If there are 100 sidechains with their own rules, doesnt the BTC blockchain have to validate all those other rules?\n\nExactly.\n\nFrom what I understood so far, for Sidechains to actually work in a trustless and decentralized way it would require Bitcoin script to be Turing-complete in order to be able to verify any possible altchain verification algorithm that could ever be invented.\n\nThe only way I can see Sidechains to function otherwise (i.e. without Bitcoin script being Turing-complete) is by trusting 3rd parties to verify that the equivalent altcoin has become unspendable... or by limiting what sort of protocol the altchains can use.': 3, "It's basically a mechanism that allows you to move your bitcoins to another, completely independent blockchain, trade them there, and they can then be moved back to main bitcoin blockchain, without a need for any third party or centralization. I will try to explain how it should work:\n\nYou may have already encountered the idea of a one-way peg. This means that you destroy some BTC, and you gain some other currency for doing that. Example: when Counterparty started, people could \xe2\x80\x9cburn\xe2\x80\x9d some of their BTC by sending them to an unspendable address, and for doing it, they received newly created XCP tokens. This is called a one-way peg, and it cannot be reversed. You can only move the money one way, you cannot turn it back to BTC later.\n\nSidechains extends this idea, and creates a two-way peg, that lets you move it back and forth. Instead of destroying BTC by making them unspendable, you lock them in little boxes. These boxes do not belong to any address, they are instead controlled by a bitcoin script. For each box you lock this way, you get newly created tokens on the sidechain (which is another blockchain, complete separate network). You can then give these tokens to someone, pay with them, and when he wants to bring them back to the Bitcoin blockchain, he can just destroy the tokens in the same way. Providing a cryptographic proof that he destroyed the tokens will allow him to open a locked box and collect the Bitcoin.\n\nSo the value is pegged, because you can freely turn one into the other at any time.\n\nThe purpose of this trick is to allow people to safely experiment with different rules, networks and consensus mechanisms, that may be suitable for different purposes, without putting the main Bitcoin network at risk. In other words, it creates an area where you can bring some of the BTC you have, try some crazy experimental stuff, and then bring them back.\n\nHere is a more in-depth article: https://bitcoinmagazine.com/12349/side-chains-challenges-potential/": 17, 'how does the pegging work?': 1, "Well no shit, there is no implementation of this yet really, its just an idea the devs are shuffling about. \n\nAnd of course they won't solve all issues Bitcoin has.

Who ever borrows them still has to pay you your dividends, etc, so you're not losing anything there. Most retail brokers will pocket the borrow fees they collect, but if you have a larger account or, I can think of one broker in specific, you can be credited for some or most of the fees they collect. \n\nFor Bitcoin, I suspect it's basically the same.

In any case, when the price of coins goes up, your net worth goes with it because the position you hold is worth more.\n\nOn a simple exchange that only offers the options of Buy and Sell, that's the end of the story - you can reduce your exposure to zero by selling off everything you hold, but you can't go any lower.\n\nOn a trading platform that allows it though, going short is the opposite; you set yourself up so that your net worth rises when the price of bitcoin *falls*.
