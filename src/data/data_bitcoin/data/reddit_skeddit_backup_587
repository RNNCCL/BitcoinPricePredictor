Unfortunately, while the question was being translated in my ear, hearing both languages ask the same question at the same time distracted me and I feel the distraction resulted in me not providing a statement that properly answered the Senator's question.  \n.  \nThe fact is that, while bitcoin transactions are traceable, the blockchain that holds all transaction information does not record identity information alongside them. This is in contrast with credit cards which require a name, address, and postal code in order to be processed. As a result, one cannot simply look up the identity of an actor who participated in a bitcoin transaction.  \n.  \nDespite this, a lot of research has gone in to identifying actors on the bitcoin network. While I had mentioned that the IP address of the sender's device can provide some insight into the sender's identity, there are other techniques as well. Research coming out of the University of California provides techniques to cluster multiple separate addresses as being owned by the same actor. Indeed, the way that digital signatures are applied to transactions can easily link these together. A whitepaper describing this technique is available here: http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~smeiklejohn/files/imc13.pdf  \n.  \nIt's possible that these techniques assisted in the arrests associated with the Silk Road in late 2013, however law enforcement personnel have not yet disclosed details of how they were able to identify the actors involved. The facts that these arrests have taken place, and the fact that bitcoin mixing services are being developed speaks to the fact that bitcoin itself is not an anonymous technology, making it possible to identify actors where necessary.\nI hope I've clarified the answer I intended to give to this question.

This fuel switching is already happening in states where cheap generation is driving down the cost of electricity - some electric utilities are paying cash to their customers to switch from gas to electric appliances and heat.": 1, ">If I give one person the keys to my front door, another person the keys to my car, and a third person the keys to my safe deposit box, that's not more secure than me keeping all three of the keys myself.\n\nRight, it is not.  But if you give a person 1/25th of a key to your car then they have to find 24 other pieces before the can start the car - that's what were talking about.\n\n> Maidsafe is basically just storage. You can't distribute arbitrary computation in this way because nobody's managed to solve the secure multiparty computation problem in a way that's efficient.\n\nThe largest super computer on the planet - folding at home - does this today.   There are some 100 plus distributed computing platforms at work today that distribute computation efficiently already, there is software already capable of parsing compute tasks and distributing them to separate nodes.  Once the distributed model takes hold you can be sure the algorithms will become more refined and better at parsing and distributing load.\n\n> If these servers are going to do anything more than just store data and provide access to it, they're going to need to decrypt the data at some point, and neither Google nor Amazon is interested in letting the entire world see all their secrets.\n\nWe're not really building this for Google and Amazon, they already have a large, well defined  segment of the market.  We think its possible to participate in that market if you are focused on making heat first and see computation as the 'waste' stream from making that heat.  We already spend factors more of our energy resources making heat which means there is already an economic benefit to making it with computation.  If ~40% or their cost to compute is energy and were getting compute power as a byproduct of using energy we would have anyway then there should be plenty of overhead in the model for reduced cost or lower performance.\n\n> So the hard drives won't fail, the operating system won't crash, the network connection will never go down?

You cannot get that same latency if your data is all around the world because the speed of light is not infinite.\n\nMy point exactly.  More computing closer to the load is more efficient.  We are talking about a model that could build compute power into every home or business as part of their heating/cooling system. When we do this it reduces the need to transfer data across the planet to remote datacenters. I guess I'm not following what you are saying?\n\n> Forceful entry proof. \n\nThey are built to fit into a containment tub that bolts to the floor, the unit itself is sealed on the bottom so, when it is installed in the tub, the internals cant be accessed. When you remove it from the tub or try to forcefully enter, the drives automatically erase to eliminate all the data that might have been on the machine from a remote client. There is a resident drive that holds all your personal data that is not erased.\nThere is also a thermal cover that slips over the top of the unit so it is completely insulated and looses very little heat. All this adds up to a pretty secure unit.\n\nwhen you consider that the machines themselves will have only bits of the information and that the sum total will be distributed across many nodes, it is vastly more secure than a server room. You would have to gain access to all the machines and then reconstruct the encrypted information from each node to gain access to the primary files.\n\nanticipating your next response: It would be as vulnerable to DDOS as any server, we really cant solve for that and there is an entire industry that works on it specifically. I'd love to use Palo Alto Network's boxes on these but it is likely cost prohibitive.\n\nCloud to heat in Germany is already distributing data, Quarnot in France is distributing and crunching data from banks (yes banks) and performing graphics rendering. With the right security protocols and controls in place we're confident there wont be insurmountable issues but we wont know until we actually build them.  \n\nEverything is impossible until its possible.

I\'m not saying its sensible - I\'m just saying it is so.\n\nIt really isn\'t. Most big companies went to CFl bulbs long before the public and the same with LED\'s. When new soloutions for things such as IT are put into these big companies the first two questions you get our "how will this affect are business goals" and "what savings can it make". \n\nMost big companies are now beginning to experiment with Wi-Fi analytics to turn off heat in rooms no ones in etc and they have had motion detector lights everywhere for years. One large bank has even stuck boards in the old gaps between the racks to reduce air bleed between hot and cold aisle. All this reduces the cost of operating the infrastructure.\n\nSolar PV is not a panacea. If you don\'t believe dig a bit into Germany. They have an excess of electricity around midday due to the massive subsidizes PV got. When then creates a problem as traditional plants need to throttle back and restart later because mass energy storage is a pig to do. There was even an IEEE white paper floated around about pluging commercial DC\'s into the grid so that when the power price went above a certain point they would use the emergency generators to put power onto the grid  (burning diesel) rather then spin up a gas or coal plant.\n\nPV is great in California, Arizona etc but pretty pisspoor in most of northern Europe and small scale wind has a lot of problems (noise complaints, maintenance).\n\nSometimes it is better to go for the low hanging fruit then the big end goal. Sticking large amounts of roof insulation in is more effective then putting up panels and extra heaters (in cold climates). For companies really basic stuff like turning down the IT infrastructure over Christmas can save $100,000\'s for essentially free.\n\nPV is fine when it is sunny but you can\'t adequatley store the power unless you have huge amounts of land for pumped hydro. By comparison a nuke plant will tick along quite nicely producing less CO2 and radioactivity released into the air then a coal plant (seriously). All you got to do is work out how to store the waste safe.\n\nGas is a major issue in Europe. The bulk of it comes from Russia and allows them to act like dicks. The problem is other plants can\'t spin up and down as fast as gas. So PV everywhere is great during the day but crap at night and wind is too unreliable as well. You will need to rely on some other form of power generation to balance them out.\n\nThis is were France has been smart. The bulk of there power is from nukes then hydro then wind/pv. In the mean time virtually all the EU nations are subsidizing energy efficiency programs to insulate old buildings, implement smart meters, outlawing incandessent bulbs etc as these measures are easy and have a much bigger impact then PV everywhere.\n\nOf course the other option is the one the co-founder of greenpeace is in favor of. Burn wood for power and plant more tree\'s making it carbon neutral.

But that\'s not the same thing as the post I was replying to, which suggested that we should "_hedge_ against volatility by _adding_ a prediction market for bitcoin price" (emphasis mine). A multidimensional market over X * USD/BTC denominated in BTC, and a market over X denominated in USD, I would argue are the exact same thing - the only difference is representational.': 2, 'Thanks for the good exposition. Someone could create a market to match exactly what you want in that case, but it would need to be complex and tied to the want--there is not a simple, independent way to do it.

I would express it a bit differently though: the problem is not that one cannot replicate the required payout, but more that, in order to do so, you need margin - you don't get that critical feature of books always being squared that you get with a CFD type structure (addition, as you say). And if you need margin then you're back to the non-decentralized structure that we're trying to avoid.": 1, 'I missed it the first time through.

The multidimensional markets -part of Truthcoin\'s design- are multiplicative, not additive.\n\nDo the math yourself, or check columns AM through AP in the "MV Scaled" tab of [my Excel MSR demo](http://www.truthcoin.info/papers/LogMSR_Demo.xlsx).

We have no intention of using Nubits. I just used that as an example of what we envision being the default currency in the system. We are working to create/find/collaborate on an easily used stablecoin. However, as Vitalik suggested, we will be coin-agnostic. We will allow you to use any currency that follows the ethereum sub-currency interface. ': 1, "I don't agree with the idea of using Nubits.\n\nHere's the error in thinking to me:\n\n* We can't use bitcoin to price contracts because its value is too volatile\n\nIt doesn't follow. It would be easy to chain together a bet on, say, a presidential election, with a concurrent bet on the btc-usd price to keep the value from the user perspective stable.\n\nDoing that instead via an altcoin is asking for trouble, not just because an altcoin is untested in various ways and lacks security, but also because the approach to establishing stable value is not going to be as good as the massively liquid btc-usd prediction market you'd eventually have at the center of all your prediction markets. In comparison to that simple, elegant market-based mechanism, the complex political structure that nubits uses looks like a disaster waiting to happen.\n\nAt the end of the day you don't get what you absolutely need - censorship resistance - without *full* decentralization and the processing power to back it up. For me, it has to be Bitcoin or nothing.": 2, 'That doesn\'t work too nicely. Suppose two cases:\n\n1. You have 100 shares of "Jeb Bush will win the 2016 election" in a prediction market which will pay $1 on success and $0 on failure, and each share is now worth $0.20 (20% chance). So you have $20 worth of shares.\n2. BTC is worth $200 (just to be clean). You have 100 shares, which will pay 0.005 BTC on success and 0 on failure, and each share is now worth 0.001 BTC. So you have $20 worth of shares. You also have a separate CFD which gives you $1 USD gain per $10 loss in the BTC price (to have this property and for the CFD to be BTC-denominated, the CFD would technically have to be on the _inverse_ USD/BTC rate, but bear with me)\n\nNow, suppose that BTC decreases to $100 in case (2). Your shares are now worth $10, but your CFD gave you $10, so you are still at $20. All good. Now, suppose that Jeb Bush actually wins. Your shares pay out $50, so you get $60 total, NOT the $100 you were expecting.\n\nSo you actually can\'t use a CFD (or any other separate prediction market) to mirror the functionality of a market that\'s pegged to USD. The fundamental mathematical logic is that using two separate markets constitutes addition, whereas a USD-denominated market, if reasoned about in terms of BTC, is multiplicative over Jeb Bush winning and the USD/BTC rate, and addition simply cannot simulate multiplication.': 2, 'Nubits basically are just a packaged version of a usd/nushares CFD contract that continually rebalances itself so it never expires and it can be traded like a fungible coin. Once you think about it that way the whole idea starts to make much more sense.\n\nGiven that the default behavior will be that users want to store bets in USD rather than BTC, making a stablecoin the default seems like a very reasonable way to go. But my stronger recommendation to the Augur team is to be currency-agnostic and allow bets to be performed in any currency that follows the ethereum sub-currency interface. So if you want nubits, you get nubits, if you want tether, you get tether, if you want a BTC sidechain coin, you get the sidechain coin, etc, and any coin can become the base currency for a market later on.': 1}, ('Any place to buy bitcoin with like a prepaid credit card kinda thing', 1): {"/r/giftcardexchange or /r/BitMarket, but I'm not sure how willing people would be to trade for that.\nAlternatively, you could find a website like WeSellDoges (never used it, personally), and use the prepaid card with PayPal to buy Doge, then convert doge to btc.
