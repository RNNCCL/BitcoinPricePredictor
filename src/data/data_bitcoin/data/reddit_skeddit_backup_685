A smart contract differs from a paper contract in several ways:\n\n* it can possess money independently of any human. The advantage here is that you trust the network, not a centralised third party.\n* it can automatically perform its code (enforce the terms of the agreement). The advantage here is that the contract does not require a legal system that derives its legitimacy via a monopoly of physical force.\n\nThis makes it both more limited in use - better suited to data-driven, logic-based agreements - and more useful in other ways - efficient, open access, things we haven\'t thought of yet.\n\nExample 1. College Allowance.\n\nYour child moves across the country to study. You want to ensure they have enough money to get by, but you\'re also concerned about their financial acumen. With these things in mind, you write up a smart contract. You direct debit a portion of your wage into the smart contract on each pay. From this amount, your child can withdraw funds according to time-based rules. Two days before rent is due, an amount equal to the rent becomes available for withdrawal. Each week, an amount becomes available for the food budget. Each friday, a leisure allowance becomes available. But what if something goes really wrong, like a car accident or eviction?\n\nExample 2. (Actually) Personal insurance.\n\nAs a responsible parent and family member, you would like to ensure financial security for those you care for. So you write up an insurance smart contract for your family and extended family. Each member contributes a portion of their pay into the contract. If an emergency arises, any member that has kept up with their contribution (or nearly enough) may request a withdrawal. If m of n family members digitally sign the withdrawal, the requested amount is released. This process can occur as quickly as a few minutes with people signing from anywhere in the world. No fees, no hidden catches.\n\nExample 3. Family Trust.\n\nLastly, as a responsible parent, you might place your assets and other wealth into a trust. This is an agreement between family members and a bank in which spending or selling anything requires m of n parties to sign off and the bank to secure and enforce the arrangement. With a smart contract-based family trust, the agreement is codified in the blockchain, this codified agreement (the smart contract) possesses the family wealth, when m of n parties sign off on an expenditure, the contract verifies and spends.': 8}, ('Blockchain Applications', 0): {}, ('Can somebody create a decentralized Uber already?

Seattle deregulated taxis in 1980, resulting in a high supply of taxicabs, variable rates, price gouging, short-haul refusals, poor treatment of passengers .... In St. Louis, deregulation produced a 35% rise in taxi fares, and taxicab drivers complained of waiting hours at airports for customers at taxicab stands. ...\n\n> A study of the deregulation of taxis in Sweden in 1991 showed that the taxicab supply increased, but average fares also increased in almost all cases.[55] Specifically, average fares per hour increased for all trips. Average fares also increased for fares calculated by distance (per kilometer) in almost every category studied - for all customer-paid trips ...\n\nIf you are happy to be convinced by that empirical data that shows, in those cases, that taxi deregulation tends to make conditions worse for consumers and providers then it doesn't follow that deregulation remains bad given that these observations are of effects before UberX days.\n\nThe issue then becomes what can an internet connected App/Service like UberX provide to change one's expectation that the outcome would be different if taxi deregulation occurred again in the same areas (noting the centrality of the computer servers is irrelevant for this question)?": 1, "I still don't see what stops the local police from ordering via that system and getting the drivers.": 1, "Yeah, let me know how you're going to have background checks in a decentralized manner.

": 1, 'Bootstrapping the web of trust from in-person contacts and friends as per the first method might be the only way to reliably avoid this. When you vouch for a peer and sign their key, the application will download and begin seeding all of their reviews and ratings. When you revoke a signature, the application stops seeding and deletes all of their reviews and ratings. If you have a friend in your network who signs someone who decides to create a bunch of fake accounts and reviews, all of their reviews and accounts will be permanently orphaned if your friends revokes their signature, or if you explicitly mark them as untrusted. Ratings would need to be locally computed in the application client to ensure they only reflected sources of information from within your individual web of trust.\n\nPublic keys acting as super-nodes to business travellers would most likely need to establish a public, above-ground presence in order to lobby the public and justify their large level of trust.

There was also short-haul refusals, and poor treatment of passengers.\n\nRight, so short-haul refusals are probably a result of a suboptimal price structure which makes short hauls uneconomical and long hauls economical. I suspect the issue is that for simplicity taxi companies want to stick to a "X + Y per kilometer" model, but the problem is that if a taxi is in a city, the cost of taking on a ride is ~x + d, where x is a static transaction cost and d is distance, since once a cab is done a ride it can immediately start looking for other rides, but in an airport for short-haul rides it\'s ~x + 2d, since the taxi needs to drive back to the airport with no passengers. For long-haul rides you\'re in the city center and so can get other rides not from the airport quickly, so there is no drive-back requirement and the cost is ~x + d again, whereas for short-haul rides the airport is a nearby point with a much higher concentration of passengers than anywhere else so you pretty much have to go back there. Hence, any price structure must necessarily either be overpricing long-hauls or underpricing short-hauls, so drivers go for underpricing short-hauls and then refusing them. At least that\'s my immediate 5-minute take as an armchair economist. Smartphone apps can resolve the issue by providing a built-in calculator that allows much more complex price structures that take this into account to be viable, as consumers can immediately see the final cost of going from point A to point B even if the underlying formula is incredibly complex.\n\nPoor treatment of passengers - well, once you have a passenger in your car, there is no market incentive to be more nice to them, so quite expected. So review/rating systems can help solve that particular issue. However I do disagree with Uber\'s approach of kicking drivers off if they fall below 4.5, as there is plenty of market room for cheaper rides that compromise on quality in exchange for lower prices; so there maybe is market room for decentralized-Uber to take this niche (I suspect the main challenge will be that people think in terms of brands, and so there are reputational externalities on the platform if a passenger accepts a $4.70 ride across the city that ends upgoing horribly wrong; the solution will probably involve marketing the service as a form of _generic public infrastructure_, like the internet, and not as a brand).\n\n> the implication being that if a driver has fewer rides they want to/need to charge more per ride\n\nSo, let\'s explore this. Initially, there is supply S and price P for taxis, with an occupancy rate O. Then, deregulation comes in, and prices jump up to P\' > P due to blah blah blah imperfect information, local micro-monopoly effects, etc. Now, drivers are only willing to stay on the roads if they earn at least $x per day, ie. if P * O > $x. Seeing P go up, we have P\' * O >> $x, so more drivers are willing to get on the roads. Hence, S goes up, pushing O down and pushing P a bit down until we have P\' * O\' = $x again. Basically, P going up pushes O down, pushing the equilibrium point even further up in terms of P. So the second argument isn\'t really a separate argument by itself, it\'s simply a weird spare-capacity effect that exacerbates the increase in P caused by the original imperfect-information problem, so solving the first problem would solve the second.': 2, "I also don't see why La Zooz wants to track people's movement data.

With the news, there has been a vocal opinion by many that this is [going to kill Bitcoin](http://two-bit-idiot.tumblr.com/post/96479024179/apple-blowback). Hah!\n\nApple is late to the game, and now joining the likes of Paypal, Google, Venmo, Dwolla, Facebook, and Amazon in the highly competitive mobile payments space, none of which have \xe2\x80\x9ckilled\xe2\x80\x9d Bitcoin yet. Despite what the media wants you to believe, this isn\xe2\x80\x99t a major innovation by Apple, this is them playing catch up, implementing a feature that should have been a key aspect of the iPhone years ago. Yes, Apple is a heavyweight with tons of cash, great connections, and a loyal customer base, but Google, Paypal, Facebook, and Amazon aren\xe2\x80\x99t exactly lightweights either.  \n\nWhen it comes down to it, none of them are competing with Bitcoin, they are payments systems, not decentralized currencies. I\xe2\x80\x99m the first one to admit it, services like Google Wallet are infinitely easier and better payment methods than Bitcoin. Using Google Wallet I can instantly send money with no fees, and Google protects me with consumer protection laws similar to credit cards. Google Wallet is awesome. That being said, it is not a competitor to Bitcoin: it is a closed system that enables you to transfer existing currencies. I could see a future where Google, Paypal, and Apple allow you to fund your account with Bitcoin, and then you can use their closed payment system for transfers. In this way, Apple wallet could work alongside Bitcoin, it isn\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily one versus the other. With all that said, Apple\xe2\x80\x99s system will most likely be even more of a closed system than the companies they plan to compete with. How useful is a payment system if you can only use it with Apple iPhones and iPads? All of Apple\xe2\x80\x99s competitors allow you to use your choice of phone/device, so it should be interesting to see if Apple decides to continue their usual path of closing off their services to only Apple device users. \n\nIn fact, the biggest change we will see as consumers is that NFC may finally take off, and that benefits everyone, especially Bitcoin users.  NFC is a low power communication tech that allows mobile payments and any type of data transmission by simply tapping your phone. Google has had NFC in its phones for years, believe it or not, I can walk into a Duane Reade and pay by just tapping my phone with zero fees, instantly, using Google Wallet on my Nexus 5. I can also tap my phone to someone elses phone, if they have NFC, and instantly transfer files, contacts, or Bitcoin. That being said, the usefulness of NFC has been limited because Apple hasn\xe2\x80\x99t included it in an iPhone. Apple has single handidly held back adoption of this amazing technology in the United States, even though you can use it to pay for the subway in places like [South Korea](http://www.startupbootcamp.org/blog/2013/july/10-largest-nfc-implementations-in-the-world.html). With Apple wallet coming out, and NFC rumored to be included in the iPhone 6, we will begin to see NFC tech in more places than ever before. Here\xe2\x80\x99s the big one: With the proper software, anywhere that has an NFC terminal or any phone that has NFC built in, can easilly accept Bitcoin payments without QR codes, just a quick tap of your phone and the Bitcoin payment is sent.\n\nApple Wallet and Bitcoin are completely different. One is merely a payment system, while the other is a decentralized and deflationary digital currency that anyone can build apps with. \n\n---\n\n#Bitcoin has several advantages:\n\n+ It permits direct transfers of funds from one person to another, with no middleman (bank). \n + This eliminates the need to trust any third party, and eliminates the fees that they charge.\n\n+ It cannot be forged/counterfeited! This is not true of any traditional currency, or even gold.\n\n+ It cannot be inflated at the whim of any government. Inflation occurs when the quantity of a currency is increased.  \n + The Federal Reserve of the United States prints more US Dollars everyday, this means the spending power of the dollar in your pocket goes down every time another dollar is printed.  \n + Bitcoin on the other hand has a finite supply just like gold, there will never be more than 21 million bitcoin.\n\n+ Similar to cash, transactions cannot be reversed -- they are final. Once a merchant receives bitcoin funds, they cannot be taken back without the merchant initiating the transaction.  \n + Credit Card charge backs can be reversed up to a month after the transaction. \n + Same with PayPal.\n\n+ It has the essential qualities that a currency must possess, some to an extent never before seen. \n + It is divisible to any unit size: each bitcoin is made up of 100 million Satoshis for instance\n + It is completely fungible: every bitcoin is indistinguishable from every other in value)\n + It is completely portable: funds are stored in the cloud (the blockchain)\n     +  It can be sent anywhere as easily as an email or text message (imagine the problems sending $10 million in gold to Zimbabwe).\n     +  You are currently not allowed to travel out of America with more than $10,000 without declaring it to customs.  With bitcoin you can travel with millions of dollars and customs would be none the wiser. \n\n+ It obviates many of the needs for banks, since you can safely keep your money yourself ([once you follow some important security guidelines](http://coinprices.io/articles/guides/cold-storage-paper-wallets-simplified)).\n + Some people will choose to still use banks for security and ease of use but at least they have the option not to.\n\n+ Just like cash, it does not require identification of individuals in a transaction, thus eliminating the major cause of identity theft.\n  +  When [Target](http://money.cnn.com/2013/12/22/news/companies/target-credit-card-hack/) was hacked, anyone who had used a credit or debit card there was at risk. \n + When you pay with bitcoin, the merchant only sees your public key so even if their system is compromised, a hacker can\xe2\x80\x99t take any of your funds.  You no longer have to trust the merchant.\n+ Proof of Payment\n + All transactions are recorded in the blockchain so you have hard proof that you paid someone and when the payment went through.  \n\n\n---\n\n\n**Disclaimer:** *This post is intended solely to provide information.

So here\'s my attempt at the impossible (and note that all of this is of course, predicated upon the assumption that bitcoin does indeed continue to increase in user-base. . .whether for predominantly mainstream, or black market transactions matters little):\n\n1.  bitcoin increases in liquidity and ubiquity as both a digital commodity/currency unit and as a payment rail; until such point that it develops more completely into a money (most importantly, is used and valuated as the unit of account for some sphere of economic activity).  See: Menger on that process.  Gresham\'s law (bad money drives out good) actually only applies when price-setting between two monies occurs.  \n\n2.  Bitcoin (as a supply limited, and in all other ways, better money) tends to drive out fiat currencies.  People become immune to, or have an escape hatch from the debasement of government monies.  With the advancement of anonymising technology and ease of use in transacting anonymously, tax evasion slowly but surely becomes more universal.  Governments are forced to tax in more direct ways, and the natives become more restless at funding things (especially war, but lots of other things too) which people now, at least a little more cleary, see the opportunity costs of (sorry for dangled preposition)   \n\n3. Governments, now less able to fund services and afford laws for which people are not absolutely willing to bear the full (and less-hidden) costs of, necessarily diminish in power and scope (possibly empowering larger, but more local governments in the interim).  Secession movements all over the world are strengthened because of this, and localism becomes more of a real trend.  Most importantly, the nation-state model essentially kills itself off (hopefully with as little of the typical violent death throes which we see of crumbling empires of the past) more so because people no longer need it, than that they are ideologically opposed to it.  Agoristic tools like Bitcoin, and other decentralizing technologies, act more as refuges from this decay, rather than drivers of it.  Most importantly among those decentralizing tools, is the widespread realization that (even though markets have long provided solutions to the bigger must-have-government problems like negative externalities, and public goods), public services don\'t necessarily have to mean "government" services, and that blockchain technology can not only provide stateless money, but many forms of stateless law and contract, and social safety nets, and swarmed and crowd-funded nearly everything.  This could take decades, it could take centuries. . . it all depends upon how quickly agoristic technology is developed, and how quickly the masses lower their time preference for decentralized solutions to difficult societal problems (like polycentric law, regional defense, externalities such as some environmental damage which is not easily addressed by current, archaic, property conventions).  But now, people at least have a much higher time-preference solution to the problems traditionally solved by coercive monopoly governance.\n\n4.  Governments that do exist, as always, will be a function of the beliefs and will of the society being governed. . . having a culture and a precedent of not deferring to centralized and coercive solution providers such as legacy nation-states; wealth creation can really take off, and make prosperity far more widespread and institutional violence much more costly to perpetrate and difficult to organize.  Just as a modern society is unlikely to revert back to monarchy, should their democratic state fail (because they do not believe in the divine right of kings for one thing), so too will modern "democracy" seem like an archaic and barbaric relic, very unlikely to ever resurge for the same aforementioned reasons.  The world becomes a much better laboratory of political science, in which different models can better be tried and compared to one another in a heuristic market process.': 1, "We have no evidence satoshi is one single person, that he is alive, that he controls or ever controlled the keys to those coins.

I think that provably fair voting will first be used by smaller organizations, but once the idea gains traction there is no reason why it wouldn\'t be extended to government applications.\n\n> This demonstrates the power of the blockchain technology, but Bitcoin the currency is a completely unnecessary piece here.\n\nThis is... a common misconception. At a fundamental level, there is no way that a distributed ledger such as bitcoin can work without structuring incentives properly to maintain the blockchain. Ask yourself: who secures and maintains the blockchain? The answer is the miners, who are rewarded with bitcoin for processing transactions and maintaining the blockchain. There is no such thing as a secure blockchain without an accompanying unit of currency. If there was, we would have seen one by now and the inventor of said "coinless blockchain" would be made fabulously wealthy while bitcoin would plummet. \n\nJust think what would happen if the value of bitcoin were to go to zero tomorrow: all the miners would pack it in and there would be no distributed ledger on which to build a provably fair voting system. Bitcoin and the blockchain are not modular, they are part of the same coherent system.   ': 1, 'Trickle down economics, duh.

The marginal cost of information storage and transmission is fast approaching zero while the cost of maintaining trust within the legacy financial system is non-trivial and will likely never go down.\n\nThe fact that using bitcoin requires only the ability to transmit and receive information without any trust requirement means that the cost of providing financial infrastructure will plummet. I agree with Andreas when he says that a lot of people underestimate the impact of bitcoin enabling billions of people to finally join the global economy on equal terms with the citizens of the developed world. The amount of human potential currently wasted due to trust barriers is staggering and bitcoin will do to finance what the internet is currently doing to knowledge and information: push the marginal cost to zero.

While the properties of bitcoin, the way it is mined, the algorithm which regulates creation of the currency, may be a more equitable distribution scheme than paper money, it still doesn\'t mean that people that don\'t work to obtain money will receive any.  Essentially it would need to be the charity of bitcoin holders to give away their bitcoins to those that have none.  Otherwise goverment force would be needed for redistribution, and we know that this is one of the main reasons that bitcoins were created.  The filthy corrupt goverments cannot take my bitcoins and give them to someone else to buy their votes.

There is no guarantee that any of the other steps will even come close to happening, even if the step before is fully accomplished.\n\nThe reason I believe that the first three steps are necessary before we can even consider step four is because the central banks and big money men have way more power at this point than the elected representatives, and no accountability.  As long as these people control the source of money, they will control the political system, regardless of what their puppets are making noise about on tv.  Bitcoin is a tool that can make their power structure obsolete.\n\nAfter that has happened, creating a truly democratic system will still be a huge job requiring the dedication of the masses, but would be much easier than now because:\n1) public money would not have to be spent on servicing debt to central banks.\n2) The money-men who are currently controlling the world from behind the scenes will be out of the way.\n\nI believe some kind of government will always exist.\nno government = power vacuum ---> somebody will take control\nThe trick is to create a benevolent government.  Bitcoin in no way guarantees this, but it does provide tools that give traceability and transparency.\n\nBanks will still exist, but if people insist on fair banks, fractional reserve banking will be impossible.

Hear me out.\n\nWhen you create a blockchain, you need a robust network of computers (computing power) to maintain it, otherwise it can be broken with a sufficiently powerful supercomputer (this has actually happened to some alternative crypto-currencies). If a government wanted to set up it\'s own block-chain and keep it secure, they would need to ensure that the total power of all the computers maintaining the blockchain is greater than the total computing power controlled by a potential attacker. In other words, if the US government set up a blockchain specifically for voting they would have to ensure that the computing power used to maintain the new blockchain is significantly greater than the total computing power controlled by all rivals (China, Russia, Google, etc.) who might be interested in manipulating the outcome of the election. This is a serious problem, even with the resources of the most powerful government on earth.\n\nThat\'s not even the worst problem with a new blockchain, though. The fatal flaw of using a new blockchain maintained only (or primarily) by the government is that said blockchain could be manipulated as long as the manipulator controlled more than 50% of the network. If the "US voting blockchain" is 80% maintained by some central authority, how can we know that that authority is not manipulating the blockchain? We cannot and trustless voting is impossible without decentralization.\n\nOn the other hand, the total computing power of the bitcoin blockchain is [higher than the world\'s 500 most powerful supercomputers combined](http://www.extremetech.com/extreme/155636-the-bitcoin-network-outperforms-the-top-500-supercomputers-combined) (!). Not only is the bitcoin blockchain protected by an insane amount of computing power, it is also not centralized, meaning that no one controls more than 50% of the network\'s computing power. This means that no single entity can tamper with a record that has been made on the ledger so things like trusless voting are possible.\n\nAnyway, that got a little long, so let me know if you have any questions.

Think decentralization.  The closer you are to dealing with individuals, the better.  Individuals will of course be attacked by the state, but likely after the points of centralization.  Why?  Exchanges are an attractive target for the state.. because they exist at the behest of the state, they will accomodate any demand, or in rare cases like Lavabit, call it a day.  Those that persist will do as they\'re told.  They\'ll collect tons of intel for the state.  They\'ll turn BTCs from a largely uncontrollable, freeing, tech, into the exact opposite.  Dependence on something that is dependent upon the state means you\'re just being routed back in the normal avenues of things.  In this case, BTC is far worse than other options.\n\nAlso, it\'s just simply inefficient.  Why go through an unnecessary step if you don\'t need?  If people in Mexico understood that they could accept, and exchange, BTC for what they needed, these ATMs would be worthless.  They\'d grant no substantial intel, as they\'re unnecessary.\n\nBTC isn\'t just an investment.  It\'s not just a payment system.  It\'s a lot of different things..  but our perspectives can allow it to be pigeon holed into smaller roles, and in fact potentially be a plague on humanity as an ultimate surveillance tool.\n\nThe silliest thing is observing two associates, one using an exchange service to acquire BTC, while the other is looking to sell using another service.  Find real individuals when possible to facilitate your transactions.  Think decentralization in all things!\n\nEdit:  Let me put it another way...\n\nA brilliant man once told me that no one wants money.  He said that if you find someone who mistakenly thinks they want money, and you tell them that hypothetically you\'re going to give them a huge bag of their favorite money, & a year later you\'ll visit them, and then you both can look at the bag of money they value so greatly, will all of the money still be there?  Their answer is, of course not.  Then you can finally discover what they truly wanted, which is food, gas, debt relief, etc..\n\nIf we\'re not lazy, we can cut to the chase with BTC (or any other barter), and cut the system out of our transactions.\n\nIf that doesn\'t strike a chord, imagine it this way...  BTC was created by a state..  lets say Japan for the heck of it.  It\'s legal tender.  It has all the technological, and economic, benefits it currently does, but now it\'s "real money" that doesn\'t need to be exchanged for any other "real money".  As I said, there is no such thing as universally acceptable money.  The only reason there are regions stuck with legal tender is because there are gangs of people with guns who force those in their turf to accept it.  As long as exchanging anything other than legal tender is allowed (or just done regardless of it being allowed), BTC doesn\'t need to be exchanged to other money often..  and when it does, it\'s efficient, and advantageous, to do so with an individual.': 1, "If you compare things now with just three months ago http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/2ht0qe/c%C3%B3mo_enviar_remesas_a_m%C3%A9xico_usando_bitcoin/ it is orders of magnitude easier (get an email or SMS on your phone and going to a regular bank ATM to withdraw pesos vs. opening an account at a Mexican exchange, linking it to a bank account, giving them your IFE ID plus another form of ID, making sure they send the bitcoin to the exchange's address, converting it to pesos at the exchange as quickly as possible to avoid fluctuations, initiating a SPEI transfer to your bank account - that can only be made during bank hours - and wait for the following day, withdrawing pesos from an ATM).": 1, 'http://media.giphy.com/media/11gC4odpiRKuha/giphy.gif': 1, "Why is it important?
