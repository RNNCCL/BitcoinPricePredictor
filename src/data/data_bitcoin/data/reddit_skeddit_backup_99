Pruning + SOME historical blocks + UTXO only, for EVERY node? What?\n\nAlso, in the future there for sure will be a solution to save on storing and transferring the whole history of data.\n\nJust an example coming to my mind, there could be a parallel data structure (which replaces part of existing main blockchain) with cleaned transactions history, with only UTXOs. Like block restructuring leaving only UTXOs and then you hash those new blocks and include this hash into current block. All nodes verify that all unspent transactions are there and after this basically the previous history can be dropped as it is not needed anymore (e.g. after a significant number of confirmations above the block with included hash has been added).\n\nI'm not an expert - but I think there are so many opportunities people will come up with when it is **really** a problem.": 5, "What you would get is two types of nodes.

There aren't as many good ideas for solving bandwidth and CPU. IBLT and weak blocks are probably the best ideas for improving the issue directly, but there are problems with these, and they aren't a cure-all. The two main competing long-term ideas for bandwidth are:\n\n* Just require that all full nodes have a ton of bandwidth. But most experts believe that this would make Bitcoin too centralized to be safe (see [here](https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-core/features/validation) and [here](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Full_node#Economic_strength)).\n* Do almost all transactions off of the Bitcoin network, using Bitcoin only as the final global settlement layer. The observation here is that a $5 transaction between you and someone who's standing right next to you should usually not need to be downloaded and verified by everyone in the world and notarized by the most powerful computing system in human history. But making transaction verification more localized in a way that is secure and decentralized is difficult and complex. Lightning is one promising attempt at it.\n\nA third alternative might be to somehow make it so that full nodes only download and verify a subset of all transactions, but this is very different from the current network, and it's not clear how to do it securely. There are no proposals for doing this in the near term.": 1, "As long as storage prices keep falling, and Bitcoin's growth is not too extreme( even given a larger blocksize) it should be possible to store the full blockchain on a single drive.

Then do basically the same thing for then next older 1000 blocks, etc. With this, in less than an hour you will be a "pseudo-full node" with much of the security of a real full node, and then in the background you will continue to download and verify more data until you are a complete full node.\n* When syncing backwards is implemented, probably the default will be to download only the last 2 years of history or something, since everyone will basically *know* that the older history is valid.\n* Using pruning, you\'ll only have to store a few GBs at any one time.\n* To allow people to do the initial sync, nodes will be able to say "I also want to help the network by storing x GB of data", and you\'ll store x GB of a random range of blocks. The initial sync will then require searching out nodes that have what you want, but that won\'t be all that difficult.\n* If the UTXO set becomes too large, there\'s a way to allow the network to forget old UTXOs but still allow the owner to spend it by providing a few kB of extra data when they spend it.': 26, ">  Also if the spam is consistent miners will probably change block inclusion minimum fee\n\nWhat?

If you own the private key of the public key which most-recently signed the token on the blockchain, that could be used as proof that you have the right to play a specific game. That token could be used as part of a signed request to download from another distributed (think gnutella, not bitcoin, in this case) network (though the content distribution network would likely need to operate in a trusted manner, it could rely on the security of the trustless network). The token could similarly be used during the sign-on for multiplayer servers.\n\nactors within the trustless system would of course have the ability to sign the token to mark it variously, even if they are not the owner (eg: "I hold this private key, and I say that this token is invalid due to cheating").\n\nI just don\'t see the opportunity for fraud.

That will begin to change as we scale up. I don\'t want to oversell BitCoin. As we scale up there will be bumps along the way. I\'m confident of it. Why? For example, as the volume of transactions come up--right now, I can run BitCoin on my personal computer and communicate over my DSL line; and I get every single transaction that\'s happening everywhere in the world. As we scale up, that won\'t be possible any more. If there are millions of bitcoin transactions happening every second, that will be a great problem for BitCoin to have--means it is very popular, very trusted--but obviously I won\'t be able to run it on my own personal computer. **It will take dedicated fleets of computers with high-speed network interfaces, and that kind of big iron to actually do all that transaction processing**. I\'m confident that will happen and that will evolve. But right now all the people trying to generate bitcoins on their own computers and who like the fact that they can be a self-contained unit, I think they may not be so happy if BitCoin gets really big and they can no longer do that.\n\nAnd to your point about using VirtualBox, the [performance test data](https://blog.conformal.com/btcsim-simulating-the-rise-of-bitcoin/) is clear. A modern desktop PC maxes out at roughly 32MB blocks. Originally XT suggested 40MB blocks as early as January 2018. How much better do you think a desktop PC is going to be in less than two years?\n\nAnd when I say a modern desktop "maxes out" at 32MB, I mean it processes 1 block every 10 minutes. IOW, that node is as good as *dead*:\n\n> After simulating the creation of blocks up to 32 MB in size, we have arrived at some interesting conclusions:\n\n- a 32 MB block, when filled with simple P2PKH transactions, can hold approximately 167,000 transactions, which, assuming a block is mined every 10 minutes, translates to approximately 270 tps\n- a single machine acting as a full node takes approximately 10 minutes to verify and process a 32 MB block, meaning that a 32 MB block size is near the maximum one could expect to handle with 1 machine acting as a full node\n- a CPU profile of the time spent processing a 32 MB block by a full node is dominated by ECDSA signature verification, meaning that with the current infrastructure and computer hardware, scaling above 300 tps would require a clustered full node where ECDSA signature checking is load balanced across multiple machines.\n\nIn addition:\n\n> Aside from the obvious network and storage constraints of running a full Bitcoin node at large block sizes, it appears the Bitcoin network is capable of handling a substantially higher transaction volume than it does currently. The CPU time being dominated by ECDSA signature checks at high transaction rates suggests a clustered full node architecture could process credit-card-like transaction rates by using a load balancing / offload approach to ECDSA signature checking, e.g. **a full node with a 10 machine cluster would top out at >2,000 tps**.\n>\n> The resources and know-how required to run a clustered node like this may impose a significant centralizing force on Bitcoin. Backpressure against the centralization of Bitcoin may well drive alternative solutions to having all transactions on-chain. Alternatively, it may end up that Bitcoin adoption grows slowly enough that the computing power of a single node grows quickly enough to avoid requiring a clustered full node architecture.\n\nHence, the only way to do VISA scale with today\'s hardware is with a 10-machine cluster. If you take it upon yourself to price out one of those rigs, you\'ll have to admit it\'s not going to be possible to do on your home PC in VirtualBox.': 1, "Real decentralization means people *and* companies running nodes.

There are several pretty recent examples. You need to read it, but not only look at publishing date.\n\nFrom what I know from discussions with many operators across the world, the average volume for an average machine is about $30K per month if it\'s in a good location. Normal volume reaches in about 6-8 months from start. That is a good point to start calculation. Here is a [profit calculator](http://coinatmradar.com/roi/bitcoin_atm_business_return_on_investment/#calc) for this purpose. Average fee worldwide for buys is about 7%, in U.S. it is higher, I assume about 10%, didn\'t check lately.\n\nHowever, there are also many costs. I don\'t say running a bitcoin ATM is easy money and everyone should jump onto the train. I think such times passed when every bitcoin enthusiast bought skyhook for $1K and installed somewhere at his small shop. Right now the market matures, bigger players come into play, there are more requirements to run it as a business, there is more clearness now legal-wise than 2 years ago when it just started, and it generates more hassle and costs as operators need to be KYC/AML compliant, means you need to spend on lawyer, licensing, getting your compliance policy written.\n\nBut it is possible to run machines profitable and many do, although again, this is not an "earn easy money" market.\n\n> My estimates for 3-5 years for North America ATM\'s are based on current trends in consumer sentiment\n\nThis is very subjective, I mean that\'s your opinion, but it is not based on any real metrics.\n\n> Recent bitcoin integrations of VISA DEBIT cards like (Coinbase Shift) and POS devices (Ingenico) into exchanges are making the leap from bitcoin to fiat easy.\n\nAgree, but this is only for bitcoin to cash, and the main demand which bitcoin ATM machines cover is buying bitcoins with cash not vice versa. It is 90%/10% ratio with dominance of bitcoin buy transactions (info from many separate operators).\n\n> I\'ll also add that the moment it becomes profitable you will see the big banks jump on the bandwagon and convert some of their already installed (hundreds of thousands) ATM\'s to bitcoin compatible.\n\nThat might happen, but much further in the future than even your projected 3-5 years. Majority of bank ATMs today are run based on Windows XP, do you seriously think they can be adjusted for bitcoins? I think if there will be native shift of bank ATMs to bitcoin direction (first of all the banks themselves have to make this shift to bitcoin in general) - they will need to update hardware or at least software on the whole network, and I\'m not sure this is possible on existing hardware, otherwise I don\'t understand why financial services are provided on OS, which doesn\'t receive even security updates anymore. And these are tremendous costs for such updates. I mean, all is doable but I hardly believe it will happen at least in any foreseeable future. If the market will grow that big current operators will eat a great profit share till this moment.\n\nBy the way many bank ATMs can be used already even without cards you mentioned, e.g. in Spain, Poland ChipChap provides possibility to sell bitcoins, but again this only about sales, not purchases.\n\n> There are certain markets that have large cash users that support bitcoin ATM\'s but this is more the exception than the rule and as a business model it\'s not sustainable.\n\nDon\'t agree with this. Figures show different trend, just look at localbitcoins charts (which basically reflect the demand for cash to bitcoin and vice versa operations) - it grows and grows a lot. This is the same market bitcoin ATM cover. My opinoin, is that Bitcoin ATM is even more convenient and reliable than meeting some stranger for money exchange. So I don\'t see any problem with sustainability of the market. Bitcoin adoption is so tiny at the moment, and bitcoin ATM is one of the easiest option to get your bits, compared to going through registration process at exchanges, sending all your docs and waiting for several days to be approved.\n\nBitcoin ATM market is growing, although may be not the fast, but I see acceleration recently.': 0, 'I think the source is opensourced.': 2, 'After ordering an ATM from them, I waited for several months, and I repeatedly contacted them with no reply for over 4 months after the expected delivery date.

Where are my keys?', 4): {'Bitcoin Core (what you\'re running) is not just a Bitcoin wallet.  It is what is called a "full node".  That means, if you connect it to the internet, it will try to download the entire (~65gb) blockchain, verify it as valid, and continue validating new blocks and incoming transactions, and relaying them to other people as well.\n\nBitcoin Core is one of a handful of implementations of the Bitcoin protocol that performs every function necessary to keep the Bitcoin network up and running.\n\nMost Bitcoin software does *not* perform every function.  Electrum for example, connects to a central server and asks for only a small amount of information -- it does not download the whole blockchain, nor does it connect to other people and relay any information.  So it\'s not participating in keeping the Bitcoin network alive and well.  But that\'s ok -- not everybody has to be a full node.  It\'s sort of like torrenting.  There\'s plenty of people who just leech and don\'t contribute, but as long as there\'s enough seeders, everything works just fine.  If you want to seed (run a full node), that\'s great, but you don\'t have to.\n\nHowever, what Electrum is really good at is being a wallet.  Bitcoin Core does have wallet functionality, but it\'s kind of clunky and not really intuitive for the user.  (Your original post highlights the difficulty in just viewing your public payment address.)\n\nElectrum is really easy and intuitive for the user, and on top of that, the payment addresses you get are derived deterministically.  So if you backup those words it shows you at the beginning, or backup your wallet file, you\'ll always be able to recover all your money from any of your addresses.  Bitcoin Core on the other hand generates new addresses at random when you want a new public address, so even if you\'ve backed up your wallet file, your backup may not contain newer addresses, so if your computer crashes, you\'re just screwed.\n\nSo for making an offline wallet, Electrum is clearly the superior choice.  You don\'t need any of the full node functionality, and all of the features of Electrum\'s wallet functionality -- the more intuitive interface, and the ability to save those words and recover all your money no matter how many addresses you use -- because of those features, Electrum is clearly the better choice for your purpose.': 2, 'Thanks for the straightforward advice.

Provided you are online and FULLY synced and up to date which can take days.  This is only the case for QT, any other wallet will just connect to the network via SPV and work instantly.\n\n3. QT tracks all the addresses in the wallet and shows you a total.  QT NEVER reuses addresses, everytime you spend it will send the unspent transaction amounts of all input addresses to a new change address also in your wallet.  Do not try to monitor QT remotely via addresses, because if you spend your money will appear to be gone, but will just be in a new address in your wallet.  They have HD watch wallets in other programs i believe.\n\n4.  QT has access to all the private keys, default is not to specify which ones you want to spend from and let QT decide.  You can use the advanced options to specify which addresses you want spend from, but this doesn't involve the private key in the UI at all, just addresses.

Should I just use one of the offline-runnable websites that can be used to generate a public and private key from a passphrase, run it offline on my passphrase, save the generated public and private keys for the future, and give out the public key to anyone that I want to be able to pay money into the account that is connected to that public key / private key / passphrase? Since reusing addresses is detrimental to privacy, how do you generate multiple addresses for one offline paper wallet using the same passphrase?\n\n2. If I use a deterministic wallet, will it be fundamentally less anonymous (and thus less secure) than a wallet that generates random change addresses, albeit to a small degree? The person for whom I am figuring out this garbage is paranoid and will probably appreciate maximum anonymity.\n\n3. Can I monitor my QT addresses separately, considering that I have no intention of spending money from this wallet in the foreseeable future? Is there any serious risk to using a QT wallet that has received money through hundreds or thousands of addresses, in theory, if all is done well and no spending happens? Or does it simply open the door for confusion once spending begins, because my change will be randomly redirected to new addresses within my wallet?\n\n4. When change automatically generates a new address within your QT wallet, does that address show up upon loading that wallet in QT? \n\n5. Is there any offline way of knowing what random address was used for the storage of QT change?\n\n6. You say that addresses are infinite... are QT addresses finite? If I take enough payments to enough unique addresses, will my wallet run out of space for more addresses? Or will it delete old addresses to make room for new ones, thus potentially deleting access to money?\n\n7. Are HD wallets easier to hack, given that their addresses are deterministically dependent on a seed? Or is it practically impossible to parse a seed from a set of known addresses, and thus generate all possible addresses for that seed, if you are not the original creator of the seed?\n\n8. Electrum or paper, given what you know about my intentions?\n\n9. Any recommendations for a thorough, trustworthy paper-wallet creation tutorial?": 1, '>I\'ve never heard of your public address changing constantly for anything in my life...
