At that rate there will be only 41,000 (give or take) new btc every year, or about a .002% inflation rate.  For all intensive purposes, we can call that a stable monetary supply.\n\nClearly the line you quoted is technically incorrect.  But from a pricing standpoint it is a practical explanation that just leaves out the details.  I assume the author knows this and only makes this assumption based on the knowledge that in two decades more bitcoin will probably be lost by amnesia than will be newly mined onto the network.

Its actually based on it.  The Supply in the equation is referring to the number of units of currency.  The quantity theory just refers to how the number of units (and its change) effects the price of each individual unit.  \n\nThere are 2 parts of the Equation of Exchange which don\'t make applicable sense.  \n\nThis is the equation:   MV = PT\n\n M is total money.  V is velocity of money.  P is Price level. T is total transactions.  Lets break this down.\n\nFirst V or velocity can only be expressed in terms of other variables.  Its E/M or Total Expenditures divided by Total Money.  We also have the definition that E=PT.  Well if that\'s the case then MV = PT can be rewritten as ME/M = PT.  Which is broken down back to E=PT.  So the entire left side of Fischer\'s equation is superfluous and the variables don\'t actually tell us anything new.  The entire variable of velocity is pointless and cant even change independently of the other variables.  Its like multiplying the distance you traveled by your speed (distance over time) and then saying you have a new piece of information.\n\nNext, we have the Price Level which makes just as little sense.  You simply cant add together the prices of TVs and chickens and then divide by the number of units and say you have some useful measurement.  The unit number is arbitrary.  On what common basis do we compare TVs and chickens?  The whole equation is more a pointless statement than a way to get anymore information out of your inputs.  Its the equivalent of saying 500 = 500.  It just doesn\'t tell us anything new or useful.\n\nNow to be fair, the article\'s equation is not very different. It cannot be used literally in any real example.  It completely ignores very important factors.  But I don\'t think the author meant it to be taken literally as if we could make the actual calculation.  I think it was meant to demonstrate a loose relationship between the variables.  And in a broad sense, the increased value of a stable monetary unit within a closed economy (not possible but necessary for the example) does in fact tell us that there has been an increase in goods and services available in the economy while lowering (or keeping constant) the inputs needed to produce them. It means the same amount of labor can produce more and is an indicator of economic growth.  One that is *certainly* more reliable and accurate than GDP or the "equation of exchange."\n\nI think that was the only point of the article.\n\nTL;DR The Equation of Exchange doesn\'t give us any better economic insight than does GDP.  GDP is a very complicated and arbitrary measurement.  The natural price of a monetary unit in relation to the whole network tells us far more about an economy than either GDP or the Equation of Exchange ever could.': 1, '*facepalm* - ty': 1, "I guess the key word to use is 'relative'.": 3, 'It is unfortunate we have no historical evidence for what happens when economies are backed by a gold like commodity such as gold or silver.

Any organization that has served over 125,000 meals to the homeless is doing amazing work, and deserves to be commended for that.\n\nWhen it comes to charitable organizations, I believe that transparency and accountability are extremely important. It is always the responsibility of a community to ensure that the individuals and organizations it entrusts with funds are using those funds responsibly. When an organization chooses not to make use of either cryptographic safeguards like multi-signature controls and public blockchain accounting, or the traditional structures for transparency and accountability such as 501c3 status and public financial filings, that communal responsibility is increased.\n\nFor the past few weeks I\x19ve been trying to get a full understanding of Sean\x19s Outpost\x19s operations. Based on my conversations with a number of people, there are several questions that have continued to be troubling. Obviously you are under no obligation to answer these questions, and they may seem aggressive, intrusive, and unfriendly, and for that I apologize. As I stated in my private message to you a few weeks ago, I'm not trying to be a dick, just trying to create sustainable best practices to protect people. I believe these are the sorts of questions that anyone asking for peoples\x19 money should have to answer, even if it is unpleasant to do so.\n\nOn September 26th, the State of Florida initiated administrative dissolution of Sean\x19s Outpost for failure to file an annual report. On October 27th you said in a comment on reddit,\n\x1cWe have already done the process to become \x18in good standing\x19 again it's just not reflected on the sunshine website. It is quite embarrassing, but ultimately doesn\x19t effect operations at all.\x1d\n\nAccording to the State of Florida\x19s Corporation Annual Reports/Reinstatements office, they have no record of any action initiated to reinstate Sean\x19s Outpost, and the people I've spoken to affiliated with Sean's Outpost were not aware of the dissolution until yesterday. Can you explain this discrepancy? Surely being legally dissolved has at least some impact on operations? As one example, this Florida statute which can be found here seems to prohibit the solicitation of funds prior to the approval of a charity\x19s renewal statement.\n\nIn conjunction with your Bitcoin Across America project, in-browser wallet company Kryptokit provided Sean\x19s Outpost with an RV. Whose name is that RV currently legally titled in? Is it being used for Sean\x19s Outpost\x19s operations in Pensacola or Dallas?\n\nIn regards to Sean\x19s Outpost\x19s finances, has anyone other than you had direct control and access to the cryptocurrency donations to Sean\x19s Outpost since the organization was started?\n\nWhat is the total amount of cryptocurrency donations received since Sean\x19s Outpost began? What percentage of these funds have been spent on Sean\x19s Outpost\x19s activities in Pensacola and Dallas? What funds remain?\n\nSince August of 2013, Bitcoin address publicized on the Sean\x19s Outpost website (1M72Sfpbz1BPpXFHz9m3CdqATR44Jvaydd has received a total of 483 BTC. On at least one occasion, a QR code provided by Sean\x19s Outpost caused a donor to give funds to an address other than the publicized address. You initially said that the alternate QR code had been inserted by a malicious hacker, but later explained that it was an inadvertent mistake by a web contractor that had been resolved. Are there any other occasions where a donation was made to Sean\x19s Outpost to an address other than the ones publicized on the website? If so, how much has been donated that is not factored in to the 483 BTC total above? What address or addresses were used to accept donations prior to August of 2013?\n\nOn October 27th you stated in a reddit comment that you\n\x1cdo not derive any salary or monetary compensation from Sean's Outpost. In fact, the cost of running Sean's Outpost has greatly outpaced the amount of donations we have received. The additional costs of operating have to date been covered by wife and I.\x1d\n\nAre there any of your expenses paid out of Sean\x19s Outpost\x19s donations that you don't consider to be monetary compensation? For instance, have donations paid for your meals, lodging, and travel to conferences? If so, how many BTC/how much USD would you estimate has gone towards these expenses? Finally, how much money/BTC have you and your wife donated to Sean\x19s Outpost, outside of the time you have donated?\n\nAre you the same Jason King who was involved with the following companies and projects?\nThe Ambrose Estate ScrollQuest game/treasure hunt project.

But they are used in different ways.\n\nA seed is used to generate a series of private keys using an algorithm (step by step repeatable process). So in that case the keys are not random but "determined" by the seed and processing steps. Hence, why those wallets are called "deterministic". \n\nEither way, you end up with private keys (random or deterministic) which is the math basis for how your btc are secured. \n\n12 or 24 word typically just determines the length of the seed, 12 being 128 bit and 24 being 256 bit (which just happens to be the same length as a private key). Seeds, though random, for ease of use are usually encoded as word lists making them easier to handle, say over the phone, or remember. In this common case each 3 words represents 32 bits of the seed, a nice chunk for most processors to work with.\n\nNow, as for what to do with Tails. Assuming you want to use Electrum you would fire that up and create a new wallet. Write down the seed words securely, redundantly because that\'s how you will recover the wallet later. Then in Electrum copy one address, the first if you like, and paste that into Circle as your "send to" address. That will send the btc to your Electrum wallet.\n\nAs a bonus you can save/export the Electrum MPK (menu item Wallet, Master Public Keys) from your wallet if you want to "watch only" your wallet on your desktop system. Optionally creating a second Electrum wallet using this MPK will give you the ability to watch and create new addresses without being able to spend the btc from that wallet.\n\nBut be aware if privacy is critical then having a "watch only" wallet, though safe from hacking, will leave traces of your addresses in servers that may be linked to your IP if you aren\'t using Tails.\n\nMost important point to take away - keep your 12 seed words safe and private because those are how you can restore your wallet any time, any where later.\n\n': 5, 'This needs to be in the sidebar.': 5, 'Addresses in a wallet and their respective private keys can be recovered if you have the seed.

Thus, the seed is itself really the only relevant private key.': -2, 'from what I understand, a seed is just your private key in an easier format?\n\nThey both give access to your funds but the seed makes it easier for the user to backup and pull up from bitcoin wallets that support it.': -2, 'A seed defines a collection of private keys, which in turn generate addresses.\n\nBest privacy practices call for using a different address to receive each payment.

To compare to other public faces, Luke-JR is an excellent contributor, but he has some very weird beliefs that conflict with many, including some would argue, Bitcoin itself, contrary to this, he has been very upfront about these beliefs and makes no bones about sharing them and people accept this because he put his cards on the table upfront. We know the type of character we are dealing with, he doesn't hide, or twist his views, even though they are controversial and downright grating.\n\nIt concerns me (to a small degree mind you, I don't want to blow this out of proportion, this is a trifling issue IMO) when something as non-controversial as your connection to freemasonry, even though you've done nothing to hide it, is somehow never something you've outwardly expressed. I don't think people should really be making a fuss about it but it does make me wonder what other societies, beliefs, etc. you follow. It's unfortunate but scammers on every corner latch onto Bitcoin to weasel their ways into people's good graces, and lead/manipulate them for their own ends on a regular basis, and this has made me constantly suspicious of people whenever someone starts getting publicly involved in Bitcoin.\n\nI've spent years following Bitcoin and seem oodles of scammers try to waltz in and start manipulating people, so knowing a public figure's personal history is important when it comes to taking them seriously or not, so when someone isn't 100% clear about their connections, affiliations, motivations, etc. I will automatically start to question their motives and whether they are genuine or not.\n\nScammers have meant trust is earnt and can be easily broken.

This was nice and all, and I had an extremely long 200char password to decrypt the wallet, and another 500char password on a trucrypt container to put that wallet in and place on the cloud and some other places. To keep track of the password (and autogenerate) I use keepass. I have used keepass since my online poker days, and know full well the terrible consequences of having weak passwords, since frequenting 2p2 forums and reading about high rollers getting the UB accounts passwords guessed and drained of tens of thousands of dollars from chip dumping.\n\nThen, after all of that and using bitcoin for a little, I read about change addresses. This freaked me out, and I had no idea how to deal with it. The reason this is scary is because once you make a purchase you have no real way of knowing (at least in bitcoin-qt) if your last encrypted backup contained your new change address. The amount of duplication of files was starting to become extraordinary and a waste of time.\n\nI finally bit the bullet and read/played with/understood electrum. I now just have copies in a separate keepass database my 12 word seed both in the cloud and on usb drives. I never need to update any files or wallets ever again. I downloaded Mycelium on my phone where I've transferred 1 coin to give to friends if they ask, and added my public key of my main electrum stash as a watch only address on my phone.\n\nThe security aspect isn't hard.

Hardware Backdoor's are real and more prevalent than you can imagine. The only way to be sure you aren't susceptible is to design and build your own CPU and computer system. Fabricating your own silicon chips is a surprisingly simple process, as all you really need is some sand.\n\n*    Once you've hand manufactured your CPU, Motherboard, RAM, and IO devices, you'll need to write a C compiler that will compile down to your CPU's native language. Writing your own compiler will keep you safe from the Ken Thompson Hack.\n\n*    Create a simple OS that you can use to access the internet. Some people might suggest using Linux, but there are 9,868,933 lines of code in just the Kernel, most of which you won't need, and personally verifying every line for rootkits might take a bit longer than you have the patience for.\n\n*    Create your own bitcoin client.
