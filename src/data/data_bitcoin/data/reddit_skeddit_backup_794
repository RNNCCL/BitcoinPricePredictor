Another factor could be costs of payments (which is orthogonal to Bitcoin\'s "global bank ledger" purpose). If Bitcoin allows cheaper payments than methods X, Y and Z, then you\'ll see more and smaller-value txs. If some clearing network (e.g. Visa) is still cheaper/faster, then you\'ll have less and higher-value txs on Bitcoin. I view Bitcoin purpose first and frontmost as a global ledger of civilization (competing with central banks and gold), not as a "payment network" to compete with other clearing houses like Visa, PayPal, wire transfers etc. Why? Because if Bitcoin fails at being safe and global ledger, its payment capabilities mean zero. But if it succeeds, then it does not matter what sorts of payment networks are built on top of it. Heck, even 1 MB block will be enough for decades. You coffee purchase does not need a global consensus. Only savings and big sums need to be secured there.

Prior to the last three months, the digital currency traded with the ebbs and flows of merchant acceptance. The following chart illustrates my point, it is the 30 day change in the price of bitcoin plotted against the 30 day change in the amount of bitcoin transactions.\n\nThere is a clear negative correlation between price movements in bitcoin and the amount the digital currency is being used for transactions.  My simple explanation for this inverse relationship is that as new merchants begin accepting bitcoin they immediately sell it for fiat currency.  This has meant that contrary to popular opinion, in the short run merchant acceptance is not good for the price of bitcoin. Of course, in the long run merchant acceptance is essential to the growing bitcoin ecosystem.\n\nHowever, something different has been occurring over the last three months - bitcoin has begun trading in lockstep with gold. The following chart shows the prices changes in bitcoin and the gold ETF over the preceding 90 days.\n\nI will be the first to scoff that correlations are made to be broken, but the relationship does have some basis in economics. One characteristic of bitcoin is its limited supply (only 21 million coins will ever exist). As well, like gold it is a currency and I would argue it is a better currency than gold.  Unlike gold, bitcoin can be used to purchase goods and services, just try buying something on Overstock with gold\xe2\x80\xa6you wont get too far.\n\nSo is bitcoin doomed to be the digital cousin of gold? Hardly. In fact I find it encouraging that it has begun to take on the trading characteristics of more mature financial markets.  As bitcoin matures more speculators will be attracted to the market and the simple act of converting some gold holdings into bitcoin could have a dramatic effect on price.  \n\nThe Bitcoin Investment Trust has a handy little table that indicates what could happen to the price of bitcoin if only a small portion of the investment dollars in gold migrated to the digital currency.\n\nIf bitcoin equaled only 5% of the value of gold, the implied price would be $47,010\xe2\x80\xa6quite a jump from the  current $335!  To be sure, taking on the characteristics of gold is not a one way ticket to the moon.  If bitcoin is disrupting gold as the ultimate store of value, it will also be subject to the downside.\n\nThe promise of Bitcoin the technology is the disintermediation of financial services\xe2\x80\xa6perhaps the digital currency is fulfilling its destiny and has chosen to start with gold.\n': 2, "I agree.

The developers of Counterparty have stated they are technology agnostic and are willing to use whatever allows them to provide the best possible solution, this of course includes sidechains.': 1, 'Sidechains are based on the revolutionary concept of a two-way peg.\n\nIn a two-way peg, bitcoins are sent from your wallet to a special address. Some magic happens, and the BTC is placed in a state of suspended animation. Your money stays frozen but it\'s still yours.\n\nOnce the BTC is frozen, you would connect your Bitcoin wallet to a tertiary blockchain, called a sidechain. For example, you might connect your wallet to the Chicago Stealth Mercantile Exchange\'s service chain, because you want to engage in commodities trading on the blockchain while maintaining full control over your privacy and security.\n\nYour wallet would, upon connecting to the CSME chain, automatically *redeem* your frozen BTC for "BTC-CSME", giving you a balance on CSME almost immediately. And magically, once you\'re finished trading on the CSME, or if you are unsatisified with the CSME service chain in any way, you would convert your BTC-CSME back into regular BTC by reanimating it on the main Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nThe theoretical benefits include:\n\n1. Since there\'s no altcoin involved, you don\'t have to worry about exchange rates and pump and dumps just to trade commodities on the blockchain.\n2. Since sidechains have far greater maneuverability than the main Bitcoin blockchain, you can do more on them. Speed up the chain so that trades execute in a snap. Add Zerocash for an uncompromising degree of privacy. **Add commodities trading natively to the blockchain.**\n\nEmphasis added because this is where Counterparty comes in.\n\nYou simply can\'t do commodities trading with BTC directly. Satoshi didn\'t add a commodities trading engine to Bitcoin.\n\nImportantly, if you want to do that type of trading **on Bitcoin, directly**, you have to protocolize the trading engine inside of the data packets being sent back and forth across the blockchain as miners validate transactions. Some call it analogous to riding on top of Bitcoin, which is controversial because the Bitcoin network has limited resources, and ultimately the embedded commodities trading engine competes against YOU in the transaction fee market, potentially driving fees up and taxing network resources above and beyond what would occur if the only thing that ever happened on the Bitcoin blockchain was morally approved international remittance payments.\n\nNow, back to sidechains. In a two-way peg, you can move your BTC into BTC-CSME and back out again, and you can get the type of trading engine Counterparty provides. But since you aren\'t sending Bitcoin transactions on the main blockchain, you aren\'t getting the full security of the main blockchain. No one knows how to ensure security on sidechains because it\'s never been done. In addition, sidechains make for a very attractive hacking target. Not only can you attack sidechains anonymously without going through Tor, there\'s nowhere for the sidechain to hide. A successful attacker gets to steal the full reserve of BTC attached to the sidechain if the security model fails.\n\nThere\'s one more advantage to Counterparty: the simplicity. When you use the Bitcoin network purely for passing around data, you don\'t have to worry about it. Just code up an app, and connect its backend logic to the Bitcoin network. Everything\'s done for you, and you have nothing to worry about so long as Bitcoin stays neutral. You also get the full security guarantee of Bitcoin itself, without rolling your own crypto. Depending on what your app\'s goals are, this style of development can be far safer and easier not to mention light-years faster than coding Bitcoin Core from scratch in C++, and arranging for your new chain to be mined by a majority of Bitcoin\'s hashing power, which is the minimum amount of security you would want for the CME.\n\nCounterparty matches orders on the blockchain. But in order for their Python app to move user balances around pending matched orders, they need to give you a distributed ledger balance. A new distributed ledger means a new cryptocurrency. But since Counterparty\'s trade engine works inside of Bitcoin transactions, the creators figured the best way to initialize their app\'s distributed ledger was for Bitcoin users to "burn" BTC by sending it to a provably unspendable location on the blockchain. Any BTC sent to that unspendable address would be rendered permanently inaccessible. The Counterparty app only needs to scan this address and credit every sender with an initial balance.\n\nThis is fundamentally different than the sidechains approach, where your funds are placed in a state of suspended animation but can be later redeemed.\n\n**Advantages of Sidechains**\n\n- Allows your current BTC balance to do more for you\n- No more worrying about altcoins or pump and dumps\n- CSME may be able to implement "HFT" block times on their sidechain\n\n**Disadvantages of Sidechains**\n\n- New and untested\n\n**Advantages of Counterparty**\n\n- Highly safe protocol development style that is generally more accessible and easier for devs to work with than groundbreaking C++, as evidenced by Counterparty beating Blockstream, Ethereum and others in a race to launch\n- Trustless private stock exchange built on the Bitcoin blockchain, with dividends payable in BTC directly to cold storage Bitcoin wallets like Armory\n\n**Disadvantages of Counterparty**\n\n- You need a separate ledger balance on Counterparty if you want advanced functionality, e.g. Intrade prediction markets. Most stock traders won\'t need a XCP balance and will instead just trade previously created company shares, paying BTC fees to send the transaction through the Bitcoin blockchain.\n- Since the Bitcoin blockchain is relatively slow to confirm transactions, trades currently execute at a snail\'s pace. However this tradeoff is worth considering since the upside is receiving OSTOCK BTC dividends directly to a paper wallet in cold storage.\n\nOne last advantage of Counterparty is that, since it doesn\'t strictly care *which* blockchain its data gets passed through, it can connect to the Namecoin blockchain or the Doge chain, or even a sidechain just as easily if any one of those proves to be faster and more secure than the main Bitcoin blockchain. Because of this unique property, a ledger balance on Counterparty is a guarantee that you will retain the ability to trade on a stock market, via whichever decentralized platform ends up being the fastest and most secure.': 9, 'or go... to the moon!': 2, 'Counterparty is open-source and community created.

You can store the public keys on a site such as watchonlywallet.com to reference their account balance.\n\nOption 2 - Download Electrum and use their word seed for generating addresses.

You only transfer the signed transaction, which is immutable (i.e. will become invalid if modified).\n\nHowever, if you get your seed leak out somehow (e.g. compromised offline machine, stolen piece of paper), ALL your private keys can be generated from it, so the fact that you are not re-using private keys does not matter.\n\n> If I want to make a transfer I open the vault and myself up to security risks, but I could potentially change the code just after the transaction so any knowledge gained would be worthless.\n\nHope it is clear from the above that in the case of Electrum, as long as your offline wallet remains offline at all times, you won\'t be opening yourself to additional risk just by making transactions.\n': 3, "Here is a tutorial on how to create an offline wallet:\n\nhttps://electrum.org/tutorials.html#offline-mpk\n\nTo clarify, you create the wallet completely offline, and that wallet never touches an online machine.\n\nOn an online machine, you generate a version of the wallet (using the Master Public Key), which you can use to receive, observe and generate transactions.

Whenever you see your own private key, you have already crawled out of the trench, and into the no man\'s land under the hackers\' machine gun fire, a proper wallet will make sure you don\'t do the stupid things, I haven\'t used Electrum often, but from all I have heard it seems to do fine.\n': 3}, ("Bitcoin businesses that don't convert to fiat?", 2): {'>Of course, I understand this information is private and companies are under no obligation to divulge it, which is why I think it should only be optional. *However, I think it would be a great way for a company to show their loyalty to the bitcoin community while actually meaningfully contributing to the bitcoin economy.* Thoughts?': 1, "Isn't this the same thing?

Regarding the value-add of the Foundation\n2. Regarding the finances of the Foundation\n3. Regarding lobbyists\n4. Regarding choice to engage government\n5. Please dismantle the Foundation\n\nThe typical purpose of questions that are in good faith is to glean more information, so as to be better equipped to make a judgment/decision about the matter in question. The questions posed by /u/tenthirtyone1031 are entirely valid on their own merits; however, the line of questioning itself as presented by /u/tenthirty1031 is disingenuous, as evidenced by his final demand - the line that, according to you, I focused on after chopping all the actual questions - 'Please dismantle the foundation'. \n\nIn other words, /u/tenthirty1031 has decided in his mind, even before hearing the answers, that the Foundation ought to be disbanded.

At least a fraction of those 5800 bitcoins came from me, because I've been a fee-paying member of the Bitcoin Foundation for 2 years; and I am satisfied (at the moment) with the Foundation and its actions to this point.\n\nWhat gives you the right (and I mean this politely) to call for these funds to be diverted to an alternate cause, funds that you did not contribute to? (You're presumably not a member, correct me if I'm wrong.) I have contributed these funds because I believe in the mission of the Foundation, and that it is beneficial for Bitcoin as a whole. \n\n(As a side point, I have also donated in the past to other endeavours likely to be more palatable in your eyes, such as Armory Technologies.)\n\nPatrick Murck, from what I can tell, is one of Bitcoin's strongest and most diligent advocates. I've seen what he has done for the community from the beginning, I've seen the statements he's worked on and put out, the testimonies he's given before Senate Committees, the media interviews he's given, and I'm happy that I've contributed to his salary.\n\nA lot of work that the Foundation does is advocacy-based - explaining Bitcoin to regulators, finding common ground, encouraging sane policy. The benefit of this is extremely subjective; how do you expect him to place a monetary value on this?  This is an honest question - this is perhaps part of the reason why your post was labelled as 'trollbait'; because the value of this activity is subjective (and low in your eyes), it's not a 'simple question' - there seems to be no way to answer it satisfactorily because you already have decided it is of low value (for e.g. in your comment about engaging government vs. software development).\n\nI'm sure the Bitcoin Foundation would love to be on amicable terms with /r/bitcoin, but if commenters are starting from the premise that engaging with government is a waste of resources, how do you expect to find any common ground from your questions?\n\nIs this really so controversial that it would split the community? I can accept that you find a low value in these activities, but to deny others the right to hold the opposing view without judgment? In my view Bitcoin already has enough external problems; it can do without all these internal struggles. Let everyone contribute to the bitcoin system as he sees fit.\n\n": 2, "I have no idea.

I'm not seeing it.\n\n> Long term holders who don't trade are long term holders.\n\n> Others who are comfortable trading are also comfortable with the more legit exchanges out there.\n\n> If Bitreserve is serving as a trade/exchange light-version for noobs, there's still a conscious decision to make some kind of trade. Who is this audience?\n\nYou have the service they are offering wrong.  It's not a trading platform (although you can use it for that if you like).  It's a bitcoin wallet that works just like any other wallet, and is compatible with the blockchain, except certain addresses (real bitcoin addresses) you designate are automatically fiat-denominated.  \n\nThe advantage of this clear: for example, suppose you are a charity.  Rather than setting up a merchant account with coinbase and creating a button that expires that your users have to click on along with configuring their 'instant convert button' and treating every transaction as a 'sale' with specific amounts, you can go much much less complicated: You can simply post your bitcoin address on your website. \n\n Now, users just send what they want to that address.  Of course, you want it to be in dollars not bitcoin because you don't want to deal with price volatility, but you also don't want to have to remember to go on bitstamp and initiate a trade every single goddamn time somebody deposits something to your address.   With bitreserve, you generate the address in their wallet and post it to your site.  To all your clients you are just a standard bitcoin address.  But on the backend, that address is dollar-denominated, so you don't ever have to think about the voliatility of the transfers you recieve.\n\nAs an alternative, think about if you and your buddy owe each-other money for pizza.  He wants to pay you back in bitcoin.  You like how easy bitcoin is to use (you just give him your address and he can send it to you in two seconds) but you don't like holding bitcoins because you don't want to lose your money.  You can have a bitreserve wallet, give him your dollar-denominated address when he asks for it, and boom the pizza money is automatically recieved by you in dollars.\n\n\nIt's the convenience of bitcoin payments and a bitcoin wallet, with the value of dollars.\n\n*EDIT HERE*:  As an example expounding on the pizza example, if HIS wallet is also a dollar-denominated on bitreserve, then there's actually no fees and the transfer is instant.  Neither of you even has to be aware of this fact.  Both of you see it as a bitcoin transaction, sending to a bitcoin address somewhere, but since behind the scenes no conversion is necessary, none takes place.\n": 18, 'Essentially, they do not need to hold many bitcoins for their customers, since they lock the price to what you deposit, to the fiat currency of your choice. It seems they will hold and sell positions on their backend depending on the price changes. \n\nSo, no, I do not think this will lead to a steep rise in prices. They merely compete with banks, holding fiat for their customers, while unlocking the value using the Bitcoin protocol.\n\nIt might turn people into bitcoin users, which could lead to an increased demand, which could drive the price up.': 1, "I get that. But I think that audience barely exists at this point.\n\nWe're talking about an audience of bitcoin users. Which means they had to buy their bitcoin from somewhere (probably Coinbase).

Why would they use Bitreserve when they can buy from Coinbase the moment they're ready to make an online bitcoin-based purchase?

The header of the block remains the same size no matter what.\n\nAlthough this is technically correct in the way I believe the question was asked, in another way emptier blocks are kind of "faster" to mine...\n\nOnly because when a suitable hash is found, the solved block itself can potentially be transmitted to more of the network faster than a different block which contains more transactions and is larger (bit-size). This means the smaller block is less likely to be orphaned - where the block recieved second is rejected by the majority of the network and therefore ends up not being part of the main chain.\n\nThere is work being done to make all solved blocks the same size when being first transmitted to the network for validation and addition to the chain. It would be possible under this system for other nodes to verify whether the block has been solved "correctly" before(or whilst) downloading the rest of the block data, therfore eliminating all difference between solving a transaction light/transaction heavy block.': 8, "You've been knocking it out of the park with informative, not-hostile posts. /u/changetip $5": 5, 'Both of these are possible and have indeed been seen.  \n\nThe no-transaction propagation is faster than block transmission with transaction and incentivizes the failure to transact, which was considered a serious enough problem that a solution was created explicitly for it.  It\'s not known how many, if any, of current blocks without transactions were intentional for this purpose, obviously, but there is a significantly larger number of such blocks than expected by statistics of time-to-hit.\n\nIf you mine a block, hold on to it, and mine additional blocks, you can statistically get more of your blocks on the chain than competitors.  This is a known issue in the protocol, and there are a number of papers that address this.  Lear Bahack has been one of the leading researchers into this area, and has continued to sound the alarms around this vulnerability.\n\nThere was a discovery of just such an issue in June that caused quite a stir.  On the Eligius pool, several miners were found to have been withholding blocks and diverting resources towards the exploit.  This was able to create an additional 300BTC in production for the exploiters, though due to the payout mechanism of Eligius, 200BTC were blocked from payout to the miners.  There is some belief that withholding is more common than reported, as it is not as easy to detect statistically and may be masked through a variety of release schedule strategies.\n\n"On Subversive Miner Strategies and Block Withholding Attack in Bitcoin Digital Currency"\nNicolas T.

A bitcoin network that doesn\'t mine transactions is no good for anybody.\n\nBut before worrying when you see empty blocks, sometimes miners don\'t see any transactions they want to handle for short periods of time, like right after another block full of transactions comes out, and rather than be idle, they go to work on empty blocks while some controlling unit decides what transactions to include and then passes that to their mining units. So you can get an empty block in that \'waiting\' time.\n\nSome people also might have found some odd mathematical optimizations on mining certain numbers of transactions or certain transactions, serendipitously.\n\n> Follow up, why can\'t people pre-mine, so work out the hash of a custom block before they add it to the chain?\n\nYou have to take the hash of previous blocks into account, so you can\'t mine into the future ("block chain" - one block following another, connected).': 2, 'Nothing.

It takes me a long time to find the solution to a block, but accepting transactions is simply a game of maximizing the yield of transaction fees while staying within the protocol rules like maximum block size.\n\nMiners are free to include or not include any transactions.\n\nOne thing to remember that I have spoke about for the last 2 years is that we are very early in the "block subsidy vs transaction fee" transition. Think of this as starting at 0.0 and going to 1.0, where 0.0 represents the genesis block where there were no transaction fees and only block subsidy. Over time we approach the 1.0 where the block subsidy is so low that it cannot be represent as value unless we extend the number of bits in a Satoshi.\n\nI can somewhat calculate that number right now by taking the transaction fees from recent blocks and comparing them to the known subsidy of 25BTC per block mined.\n\nTaking the high of the last few blocks mined it\'s about 0.15 BTC in total transactions for a block right now. We are still very early in this transition, where the primary funding of the blockchain technology is through subsidization of the printing of new coins.\n\nThe subsidy will halve every 4 years, so it will be 12.5 within a while, but that won\'t change much for a few more iterations. What I expect to see is the number of transactions go up through a large growth of adoption, even if not directly from consumers themselves (like institutions that use the blockchain)': 2, "You can premine, in a way.\n\nBlock witholding attack. \n\nYou mine a correct block and start on the next one before releasing yours.
