The best bet is, find a bank that will let you use Coinbase or Circle and not complain about it and buy bitcoin and spend it the same week somewhere you can get it accepted or somewhere that already accepts it. If you are worried about the price swings, buy it immediately before you want to spend it. Keep your 7 bitcoin in cold storage, use your .5, and buy more to transact with. That\'d be the best bet. Don\'t use it for gift cards and such. That\'s not helping anybody but the big gift card merchants which already have an interest in it. Try to get people locally to accept it in place of dollars. The more people that accept it, the larger of a portion of the world economy uses it, and the more your 7 BTC holding will be worth because there are ONLY 21,000,000 coins to ever transact with. The more people wanting it for their wares, the more it will have to be worth to support the economy it\'s providing an exchange medium for.

MySpace\n\nWhich were all built on TCP/IP, which is still here.\n\nBitcoin is more like TCP/IP than MySpace, because a currency has a much stronger network effect than a social media website and since Bitcoin is a protocol like TCP/IP.\n\n> Social networks are a familiar and often-cited example of the network effect. Facebook and G+ both have a lot of nice features, but the feature that makes Facebook so much more useful is that all your friends are already on it. Thus, it is really the network that uses Facebook that makes it valuable.\n\n> This example can be confusing when analogized to currencies. Facebook and G+ have the property that either can be used at a low opportunity cost of using another. In other words, if I am already spending some time crafting the most narcissistic Facebook status update that I can think of, there is little additional effort to posting it on G+ too. Both Facebook and Google support chat protocols, so there is little additional effort to using a program such as Jitsi that can run both protocols and log me in to both services simultaneously. Thus, it is possible for a social network to succeed without diminishing the size of the others. It can expect to attract members without necessarily drawing them away from the others.\n\n> However, for currencies the situation is different. Owning any one currency carries a high opportunity cost of owning any other. I cannot use the same money to buy an investment in bitcoins and in silver coins or Canadian dollars. If I want more of one, I necessarily must have less of another. If any one currency is acknowledged to be the winner over the rest, then there is no additional benefit for anyone to own other currencies.\n\n> While it is possible for two social networks to coexist, the world is not big enough for two currencies. Any initial disparity between two currencies, no matter how small, positively reinforces itself, and there is no reason to expect this effect to end until one currency is driven out of existence. As the price of currency A begins to rise relative to currency B, holders of currency B begin to see that their investment is looking less and less reasonable. As more people flee currency B, its decline accelerates until it has effectively ceased to be a currency.\n\n> This conclusion does not appear to be borne out by our everyday experience of different national currencies within each nation-state.  This is explained by the fact that these states typically have legislation such as legal tender laws and capital controls that artificially reduces the usefulness of other currencies within their respective borders. There is no jurisdiction in which Bitcoin is legally privileged, so there is no group of people required to treat it differently than any other. Thus, there is no reason to expect Bitcoin ever to be in a stable equilibrium with national currencies, the way that they are in equilibrium with one another.\n\n> From these considerations, it follows that Bitcoin\xe2\x80\x99s future is an all-or-nothing proposition. If Bitcoin is good enough to compete with other currencies despite their legal privileges, then it will overtake them. If not, then it is a bubble and eventually no one will want it but a few true believers.\n\n> It might be argued that Bitcoin could retain its uses on illegal markets, but there is no reason for a drug dealer to accept bitcoins as payment if there is no one who wants to use it as a store of value or as an investment. He must either want to keep it himself or have someone he can sell it to in order for him to use it. Thus, if Bitcoin fails as an investment, it fails as a payment system, even for purposes to which it is especially adapted.\n\nhttp://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool/why-bitcoin-will-continue-to-grow/': 2, "If a portable teleporter existed I would use that instead of a car. The only problem is that it doesn't": 1, 'Bitcoin was the first mover in this space to gain the significant network effect.  It has millions of users and billions in market cap.  There are many other altcoins out there, some with exciting innovations and many with nothing revolutionary to offer.  \n\nIt\'s pretty much expected that if an altcoin ever came to have a "must have" innovative feature, it would be copied over to bitcoin in some fashion, in short order.  ': 8, 'Bitcoin is #1 right now however if another coin starts to outpace bitcoin you can bet this whole sub will buy ': 1, 'It is sort of a double edged sword. The more money that gets wrapped up in bitcoin, the more difficult it gets for any major changes to be made to it. Look at the dust up over raising the block size limit, as a current example. ': 0, 'I agree with the second part...Bitcoin can\'t fall to zero (or near it) unless an exploit is found in the core. Such an exploit should be part of anyone\'s risk analysis in terms of *investment* in it -- not the usage of it, which can take place instantly without too much concern about the future viability. But if there are users, it can\'t fall to zero. If it works, it won\'t fall to zero.\n\nPutting too much faith in the network effect, to address your first point however...networks rise and fall. AOL. Friendster. MySpace. The network effect is inertia. It\'s not solidity. It\'s not the "future" by necessity and by definition, it\'s the "now" with the ever-present threat of erosion.': 2}}}
