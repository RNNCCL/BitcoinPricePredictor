I am a software engineer from KeepKey and know that we always put security, usability and privacy first. Ledger, Trezor and KeepKey all have security of your bitcoins as a top priority.\n\nAs a comparison of the security features of Ledger and Trezor, here are the things you need to consider:\n\n**Day-to-day use:**\n\nBoth products are designed to securely store your private seed in a way that provides tight control of it's use. Ledger has a mobile app that replaces the security card. The security card is only needed to set up the mobile app: bonus points for 2FA built in. Trezor is secured by a PIN that is entered with a rotating keypad. On bad PIN entries, the device will not accept another PIN attempt for an exponentially increasing amount of time. All security is really about making it take a long enough time to break in that it 1) isn't worth it, or 2) you have time to take other security measures. The PIN scheme for Trezor is sufficient to provide a high degree of security.\n\nKeepKey's PIN scheme is identical to Trezor's.\n\nAll three products are compatible with third-party wallet software, so will continue to work even if the manufacturer not longer supports it (but you will need to change from myTrezor, myLedger or the KeepKey chrome wallet to something like ethereum).\n\nAll three products also provide a execution environment separate from your computer/mobile device that is highly secure. This is probably the most important feature of any security device.\n\nI think the you will find that the three products converge on features and functionality over time. At any given time, one might be ahead of the others on a feature, but all three are actively working on their products and will work toward feature parity (on occasion, we even do so cooperatively).\n\n**Initialization:**\n\nInitializing the device with a private seed is an important consideration because if done incorrectly, your seed can be compromised from the beginning. Trezor generates the seed on the device using two random number sources. One of the sources is a hardware based true random number generator (TRNG) on the device. It relies on electrical noise from the environment. I don't know the specifics of how this works, but Wikipedia does (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_random_number_generator).\n\nThe other random source is the computer/mobile device that the Trezor is attached to. I believe that myTrezor uses the Crypto library in your browser which creates entropy over time, so is also a very good source of random data [@stickac can you confirm this?]. Having two sources of randomness is important because if one source is found to be less random, the other source compensates.\n\nLedger doesn't generate any entropy on the device itself. It relies on the attached computer/mobile device to provide entropy. Like Trezor, I believe that they use a strong crypto library, so this is probably truly random, but since it is a single source, you don't have the extra insurance that a second source provides.\n\nAn additional consideration is that when initializing a Trezor, the private seed is generated on the device and never leaves the device*. With a Ledger, the private seed is generated externally and sent to the device. Assuming the computer being used is compromised, the private seed on the Trezor is still safe, but the private seed on the Ledger is exposed. To mitigate this, Ledger has recently started selling the Ledger Starter (https://www.ledgerwallet.com/products/7-ledger-starter) that provides a secure execution environment for initialization. I don't know much about Ledger Starter, but if @BTChip says it is secure, I trust him. If you buy a Ledger, I would consider this a necessity.\n\nKeepKey works the same as the Trezor for initialization with minor differences due to the size of the screens. The KeepKey is able to show your entire private seed on one or two screens, the trezor takes 24 screens to show it.\n\n* Trezor and KeepKey show the private seed generated on initialization on the screen one time for backup.\n\n**Recovery:**\n\nRecovering your private seed is also an important consideration because if done wrong, your key will be exposed or weakened substantially. Ledger's recovery story is similar to their initialization story. You enter the private seed on the connected computer/mobile device and send it to the device. Again, assuming that your computer is compromised, the private seed is compromised by this approach. I believe that Ledger Starter has a recovery story that mitigates this. I don't know from firsthand experience, but again, I know and trust @BTChip, so if he says Starter solves this issue, I believe him.\n\nThe analysis of Trezor's recovery story is a little more complicated and requires math. When you launch the recovery, the device asks you to enter the 'mnemonic' words that make up your private seed. They are presented in a random order and interspersed with noise words. These approach leaks a lot of information about the seed on a compromised computer. The default Trezor seed is 256 bits long. After one recovery, someone cracking the seed can narrow it down to 48!/24!. That represents a loss of around half of the bits of entropy (it's still a big number, though). After two recoveries of the same key, it's worse because now the noise words can be identified and eliminated. Considering only 24 words, but not knowing the order leaves 24! permutations. This leaves approximately 80 bits of entropy.\n\n80 bits is still uncrackable for all but well funded governments.\n\nKeepKey takes a different approach than Trezor. KeepKey uses a rotating cipher to enter the mnemonic words that represent the private key. (https://support.keepkey.com/support/solutions/articles/6000032313-how-do-i-enter-the-recovery-sentence-into-my-keepkey-device-) The only thing the connected computer can see is the number of characters the user enters before the word autocompletes on the screen of the device. The math here is complicated, so I won't go into it, but this information can be used to reduce the combinations by about 11 bits.\n\nThe thing that enables KeepKey to use a rotating cypher is the larger screen, which accounts for big part of the price differential. In a sense, the larger screen is a security feature.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nConsidering the security factors, for day-to-day use all three are solid choices. If you dig into the initialization and recovery, they Ledger and Trezor have issues and KeepKey has built a more secure implementation. Since you ruled out KeepKey based on price, the products I would recommend from a security standpoint are (without preference):\n\n- Trezor\n- Ledger Nano with Ledger Starter\n\nIf you have been on the fence about buying a hardware wallet, today is a great day. KeepKey, Trezor and Ledger all have Black Friday specials and the price of bitcoin is up.\n\nIf I got any of the details wrong here, I hope that @btchip and @stickac will chime in.\n": 7, 'Nice!

People just drive by, shoot them funds, and keep going. \n\nAs with everything in bitcoin, the problem is that there's no infrastructure. We think we have infrastructure, but we don't. \n\nA system would need to be built on the layer above facilitating the homeless to acquire QR codes.  Those QR codes would be associated with a recognized charity or service that offers an app.  The person driving by will therefore know their funds will only be used for food or supplies. \n\nThis network could facilitate the creation of the QR codes, and the holding of balances. The organization would have relationships with local grocery stores and drug stores, allowing them to go shopping with their bitcoin balance to buy food, and get products necessary to live.  \n\nIf done correctly, people would actually donate more because they know the funds could only be spent on food or supplies, instead of alcohol or drugs. See how that works? Welcome to the future!\n\nThen of course we have the problem that right now, those driving by likely won't be holding Bitcoin balances.  But this could absolutely work if Bitcoin infrastructure starts getting built, and use cases start expanding. As with everything in bitcoin, the problem is the on-ramps, the off-ramps, and the complete lack of infrastructure in between. \n\nWe need innovators to start building services on the layer above so this experiment we believe in can really start changing the world for the better.

Then why has growth in user numbers stalled for multiple years? \n\nThough that\'s a rather dismissive way to phrase the summary, yes, that\'s a fairly accurate description of the claim, in my opinion. However, with regards to your "growth has stalled for multiple years" claim, I\'ve actually noticed data indicating the exact opposite. I think, visually speaking, the most staggering charts that demonstrate this are the [global LocalBitcoins volume charts](http://coin.dance/charts), but there is plenty of other supportive evidence indicating adoption growth, even including price, with the recent re-emergence of a bull-market in 2015.\n\nFurthermore, at least in my opinion, it doesn\'t seem logical to expect Bitcoin adoption to proceed in a linear fashion, steadily growing each month, because one of the most compelling reasons to own bitcoins is as a speculative tool or investment, and people don\'t like to buy in during a post-bubble fallout. It\'s only after a bottom is reached, the market has stabilized, and a bull-run materializes again that the feedback loop really kicks into gear. This might sound like a chicken-and-egg problem on first glance, but empirical evidence actually indicates that it\'s not -- there have been many bubbles throughout Bitcoin\'s history, and in the interims between them, "growth in user numbers" has always seemed to be stalled, relatively speaking. But if you think about it, that makes perfect sense.\n\n\n>What if I know who he is and force him to hand over his keys? Then I could claim to be Satoshi.\n\nThat\'s a valid point, and you\'re absolutely right - my initial statement on this matter was untrue. The general point still stands, but I phrased it far too strongly.\n\n>Except he isn\'t. A post in /r/bitcoin[1] doesn\'t make something true.\n\nHe/she was already [nominated](http://www.businessinsider.com/bitcoin-inventor-satoshi-nakamoto-nominated-nobel-prize-economics-bhagwan-chodry-2015-11?r=UK&IR=T) by Bhagwan Chowdhry.\n\n>Which almost certainly means you trying to push your politics on others.\n\n\nAre you trying to say that there is no way to have a discussion about nuanced societal issues without trying to "push your politics on others"? If that\'s your stance on the matter, unfortunately we may just have to agree to disagree on this one. Like I mentioned earlier, I\'ve had plenty of stimulating and amicable conversations with people who fundamentally disagree with me on things like "the nature of money and its role in society" - if you\'re open-minded and willing to listen just as much as you\'re willing to speak, you can have great exchanges without ever trying to force your own beliefs or perspectives onto those around you. I\'m sorry if you haven\'t yet had the pleasure of having such a conversation, but please don\'t rule out the possibility, because that might accidentally result in a negative self-fulfilling prophecy.\n\n>Unless you\'re a trader or emotionally invested a conversation about a currency is almost always without fail going to be tremendously boring for all participants other than the originator.\n\nThis actually highlights *another* reason why Bitcoin is such a fascinating topic of conversation: it\'s **not just a currency**! It\'s a protocol, network, technology, and model, and many other things, too. \n\nSurely you must understand the allure of the subject, considering you spend so much of your own time discussing it. I see that over 80% of your reddit comments are in /r/Bitcoin, /r/BitcoinMarkets, and /r/Buttcoin, and that Bitcoin has (by far) the single highest word frequency in all of your posts. So I really don\'t understand why you seem so determined to argue that Bitcoin isn\'t an interesting subject to discuss, when you spend the bulk of your time online discussing it!\n\nIn any case, I\'m really not here to try to argue that Satoshi is going to win the Nobel Prize, or that Bitcoin is being rapidly globally adopted, or anything like that, but rather that Bitcoin provides a foundation for plenty of interesting conversations and discussions. I think it\'s pretty disingenuous to pretend that the only possible way one of these conversations could possibly play out is "Bitcoin is interesting..." "ya I guess so" "Yeah like it\'s decentralised" "Yup..." "so.....why are you walking away?" and I just wanted to provide a quick example of another direction the conversation could conceivably take. The details (like whether Satoshi is actually going to get a Nobel Prize) are mostly irrelevant, since I was mainly speaking to the possibilities of discussion instead.': 8, 'sorry what?

Maybe it\'s more apathy, I don\'t know...': 5, 'There are plenty of interesting aspects worth *at least* one discussion or conversation when it comes to Bitcoin. \n\nFor instance, I find it rather mind-blowing that the creator(s) -- Satoshi Nakamoto -- is entirely pseudonymous, and basically disappeared altogether from the scene before their creation really started taking off. Satoshi even explicitly predicted Bitcoin\'s growth in a number of different quotes, and described with almost-eery correctness the "positive feedback loop" phenomenon that continues to drive Bitcoin adoption to this day, half-a-decade later. Can you name a *single* other multi-billion dollar industry or technology that was created out of the blue by a person or organization who remains unidentified? Can you think of any other examples where a single secretive creator suddenly brought a technology forth into the world which has grown into an almost-universally-recognized revolutionary and game-changing invention? The tale of the genesis of Bitcoin, alone, sounds like the plot of an over-the-top spy movie. \n\nFurthermore, it\'s really cool to me that at any time, Satoshi could step forward and prove, beyond a doubt, with unassailable cryptographic evidence, that they are the actual creator of Bitcoin. So it\'s effectively impossible for someone to "steal credit" for the idea!\n\nEven people who don\'t care about the specifics of the technology and how it works "under the hood" can appreciate stuff like this; Satoshi is/was a remarkable entity, and is even being earnestly discussed as a candidate for a Nobel Prize in Economics, despite his/her/their true identity remaining unknown.\n\nThis is just one little example of something interesting and conversation-worthy when it comes to Bitcoin. There are plenty of other fascinating aspects which might be worth diving into instead, depending on your given audience and context. At the very least, Bitcoin opens the doors for conversations about the nature of money, value, and currency, and how these things are managed in modern society. This is a conversational rabbit hole with no discernible end; I\'ve had many wonderful and enlightening conversations/debates with people who most certainly would *not* identify as "Bitcoiners" about these things, and I feel that talking about "heavy" subject matter like this can sometimes really animate and enliven a group of people that would otherwise be making inane small-talk at best.\n\nI do agree that there is a tactless way to go about it, too... if someone is clearly not interested in talking about a particular topic, it\'s almost always best to drop it rather than ignore the signals they send. But with the 2013 bubble(s) so far in the rear-view mirror at this point, I\'ve noticed that most pro-Bitcoin people don\'t really try to evangelize much these days, despite what those folks over at /r/Buttcoin would have you believe! \n\nIn any case, my point is that there are plenty of different cool routes a conversation could take, when it comes to Bitcoin.

GPU mining was already available.  In January 2011 the total network hashrate was already > 100GH/s (by the summer the hashrate was being measured in tens of TH/s).\n\nTo get 11000 BTC requires mining 220 blocks @ 50 BTC per block.  To do so in 1 month would require finding roughly 5% of the blocks for that month.\n\nThat means that we can assume that the miner would need ~5% of the total 100GH/s = 5GH/s mining capability (that would be assuming that he was mining in January - if he was mining in July, when the total network hash rate was 10,000 GH/s, he would have needed 500GH/s).\n\nSo, if he was CPU mining @ 5MH/s in January 2011, to achieve 5GH/s, he would have needed 1000 CPUs to mine ~11000 in a month.  By July he would have needed 100,000 CPUs.\n\nLet\'s say he was mistaken and was using a GPU instead of his CPU.  Typical GPUs in 2011 produced ~20X the hashrate of CPUs - so let\'s say he had a 100MH/s GPU.  He would still require 50 GPUs.\n\nWe rate this story FALSE.\n\n---\n\nEDIT: [this thread](http://www.minethings.com/app/webroot/forums/viewtopic.php?p=90820) dated Wed Mar 16, 2011 6:08 pm is a nice time-capsule into mining at the time.

Here\'s the best answers for a quick type-up:\n\n* What is the mark-up or "organic fee" for a first time buyer? And for an average buyer? That depends on many variables, including the amount they are purchasing. The amount they are purchasing is priced with a formula that we do not intend to release, as the formula\'s intention is to give us a competitive advantage in certain contexts. Sorry! As a basic rule of thumb, you will always receive more of a discount when you are buying more bitcoin, and the fees get lower the more you use our service. The formula also takes into account user-based discounts, country discounts, and discounts specifically for certain payment methods that we are promoting or looking to get more people to try (for example, through our Money Gram billers). The first time buyer\'s fee to the seller is always what the seller wants--whether it is a fixed price or a dynamic/formulaic pricing model. The first time buyer\'s fee to WOC is always higher than the returning customer--unless we are running a special promotion.\n\n* How can buyers determine what their organic fee paid is? I\'ll admit, it\'s not easy at the moment. As more people use our service\xe2\x80\x94although no one has asked for this yet\xe2\x80\x94I do see it being valuable information. I will bring this back up with team when we compile new features for development. In our original design, we did not believe this to be useful in the buyer\'s decision of whether to buy from us or not, and we have research that shows this: if the price is lower than another market, then that\'s all most buyers care about. However, to determine the organic fee paid, in some cases you can find out by looking at the bitcoin transaction itself that delivered your coins. Alternatively, you have to know which offer you received on the order book--while generally it is the lowest offer, it could be the 2nd to lowest offer depending on your volume needs, or a combination of the 2 offers if you selected a "Best Value" offer.\n\nOur goal with Wall of Coins was to keep things extremely simple and secure. We didn\'t wish to bombard new-comers with unnecessary numbers because that has proven to be a factor inhibiting adoption. We are hyper focused on marketing bitcoin adoption to people with little to no previous experience in the space, and the seasoned bitcoin veterans are smart enough to figure out how our system works. As stated, we conducted a ton of research while writing the design document for Wall of Coins to determine the easiest way possible to acquire and sell bitcoin, and this research--along with the advice of our lead security analyst--dictated how we would design the system and experience. We are a market maker where people buy lower than a price relative to another market and where people buy higher than a price relative to another market. In a world where there\'s more buyer demand, then naturally there is more buying pressure and prices go higher. Instant bitcoin with cash is proven as valuable...and that\'s just the reality of the world we live in. This is our style: instead of saying, "You\'re paying a total of $100 for X bitcoin, where technically you would pay $96 at some other arbitrary market for the same bitcoin, $2 to the seller, and $2 to WOC.", we opted to be different and simplify it by saying, "you\'re getting $100 for X bitcoin." Plain and simple, and ultimately the only figure that a buyer cares about.\n\n* How can sellers determine what organic fees their buyers are paying? You\'d have to link up the transaction with the orders in your history. This question is the same for bigger institutional markets: how does the seller determine which tier the buyer was on and what fee they paid exactly? I don\'t know of a single market where you can tell this... and I\'d wager that the markets did not have their development staff implement this feature for the same reason we haven\'t: it\'s not in demand. In the end, all sellers care about is whether their coins sell. The less work they have to do for their coins to sell, and the more liquid their coins are, the better the experience. Wall of Coins excels here, and our sellers are happy with our service and extremely loyal.\n\n* How does an organic fee differ from a hidden fee? It depends on how you wish to look at it--it\'s all perspective. Are chain grocery stores charging a "hidden fee" because they don\'t tell you how much they make from the wholesale price? Are all of us (bitcoin exchanges) being dishonest when we say the current price of bitcoin is $420.40 USD when the buyer actually paid MORE to get the bitcoin after you include fees, incoming wire fees, etc? I\'m more of an optimist, and I would say that we\'re all just looking to make the experience less confusing and as easy to understand as possible. If you\'re looking to spend $440 (or even $4,400) on acquiring bitcoin and you see that Wall of Coins will give you the most bitcoin for your buck, obviously you\'ll use Wall of Coins. The opposite is also true, unless the other source (market) is just too difficult to figure out how to navigate and operate.\n\n* Do you consider this transparent? If we weren\'t transparent, would you have even known to ask these questions? Our 100% transparency refers to our bitcoin deposit addresses\xe2\x80\x94you can make a watch-only wallet of our entire operations. This is a huge step up from any bitcoin exchange\xe2\x80\x94from my knowledge, even after 18 months of solid operation\xe2\x80\x94Wall of Coins is still the only exchange that practices this.\n\n* So I\'m wondering whether I\'m making a methodolical error in analyzing your transparent market, or whether you are actively misleading people about fee sizes by about a factor of ten? Honestly, from experience I know that there are many opportunities where things can be misunderstood. For example, is the number that you\'re looking at both the compiled seller fee and WOC fee? It would have to be. Considering our website does not yet have literature on this difficult to communicate topic, I think it\'s fair and easy to rule out and say that we are NOT actively misleading anyone. Our philosophy is basically: does the buyer see an attractive price? Then by all means, buy it before someone else does! Don\'t see an attractive price? Check out another service. We understand that these situations exist in these purely demand driven markets.\n\nIn closing, there\'s a reason why most people continue to use Wall of Coins: we take customer feedback very serious, we\'re constantly updating our service to reflect this, we apparently have the best security practices in the industry (this was our intention, regardless of how expensive it is), and we make an effort to hear and communicate with our customers\xe2\x80\x94we are still the only exchange with a toll free number for customers. I think we should definitely release an API that specifies any dynamic premium prices, as well as determines an easy way for buyers to determine what fee amounts they are paying to the seller and WOC. Likewise, these questions and answers will be brought up in our next feature meeting. Thank you again for taking the time to look into our service, comment, and ask!\n': 1, 'We don\'t have a normal markup... our system utilizes a technology that we call "organic fee".

We identify a new information leak in the OpenSSL implementation of the ECDSA digital signature algorithm.

Bitcoin Core, as well as several other popular wallets, uses this library (and not OpenSSL) for producing signatures, so this vulnerability is not a concern.\n\nIn fact, Bitcoin Core has produced signatures this way since 0.10 -- the remaining use of OpenSSL was only for signature verification, which naturally does not involve secret data at all and cannot be subject to compromise.\n\nA few people have mentioned that `libsecp256k1` appears in the paper, in a survey of different scalar multiplication functions. The paper itself points out that `libsecp256k1` does not use the vulnerable scheme and therefore the result does not apply to it. They do comment "all of the above approaches have potential side-channel issues", which sounds ominous.

Not due to some nefarious intent, but simply due to the imperfection of any one meat-filled skin bag - decentralization and markets are simply more efficient at capturing and processing information than command-based economies.\n\nBitcoin is obviously more than a currency, but the governance issues are the same. While the solution that bitcoin has provided is better than competing technologies, the governance of bitcoin is still as antiquated as its competitors.\n\nI would like to see the community step back from the code for a minute, and focus on how to improve governance to better acquire data and information in a more efficient manner.": 5, 'Funny you mention it since dgenr8 Concept-ACK\'d the pull that just got merged.\n\n"Mike doesn\'t like it" isn\'t exactly an example that is going to persuade many :)': 2, 'Feel free to run XT, or UL, or whatever.

To me, it\'s just another example of ad-hoc governance that\'s unlikely to be considered acceptable in any widespread adoption scenario.\n\nThe article I linked has quotes by a few people other than just Mike. My point is that with those kinds of concerns, a proposal like this wouldn\'t be likely to get through a traditional governance approach, without at least attempting to address the concerns.\n\nWith a currency that\'s widely adopted, conservatism regarding changes, especially controversial ones, is generally seen as a positive trait. Bitcoin is still functioning as a kind of working experiment. People and businesses who understand this are not going to want to be significantly exposed to the experimental risk that it entails.\n\nThe bottom line, coming back to a point that /u/jeanduluoz made, is that politics is about as important, if not more so, than technology for the long-term success of a currency. We don\'t normally see this very explicitly because currencies have been so closely associated with national governments, and so currency management is subsumed into national political processes. Removing national governments from the picture exposes the political element more openly.\n\nBitcoin has some good answers on the techological side, but weak answers for the political side. Even attempting to address known weaknesses on the techological side is exposing the political weaknesses.\n\nEdit: I should clarify that I don\'t think what\'s happening currently is necessarily "wrong" or anything like that. Rather, it\'s that Bitcoin-as-experiment and Bitcoin-as-truly-widespread-currency are not likely to be compatible, and the idea that the former will evolve into the latter is at best an optimistic hope. If widespread adoption is an actual goal, then attention will need to be paid to the governance side of things, one way or another.\n\n': 1, ">We're only just starting to see the results of that in practice.  \n\nLike?": 0, 'Fantastic points.

But a layer above that - the governance - is still the same.\n\nArguably, governance is worse. While it\'s similar in that it\'s centralized in the hands of a small number of people, the way in which those people are selected is not designed to optimize for ability to govern a currency, and decisions are being made based on criteria and beliefs which, in any more formal organization, would be rejected early on.\n\nThat\'s not to say the traditional central bank model is perfect - far from it! - but the "developers rule" model (in conjunction with "miners accept") is likely to be significantly worse. We\'re only just starting to see the results of that in practice.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how the traditional banks interested in Bitcoin try to address this. You can bet none of them is happy about the idea of betting billions or trillions of dollars on an ad-hoc governance system in which they have no direct representation.\n': 3, "I'm getting deja vu here.  \n\nLet me just say this.
