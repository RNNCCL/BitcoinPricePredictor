This way if a user wants to essentially unpeg  sidechain coins they own because the sidechain failed, or maybe they just want their bitcoins back for whatever reason, the user can use the information stored in the sidechain coin to still move the correct number of coins in the Bitcoin network that were dedicated to the sidechain. \n\nColored coins is a very loose, quasi-sidechain example, bitcoins can be selectively "colored" or marked with extra information to represent something else, such as a stock, but it still retains all the information needed to still use it as a bitcoin. If the stock fails for that colored coin, or the holder wants to abandon the stock and use the bitcoin instead, the "stocks" that the user received as fractions of a bitcoin can be spent as a normal bitcoin without any problem. This will affect the total number of stocks on record (as it can no longer be used as a stock anymore), but the spendability of the bitcoin that was essentially used to peg the stocks to remains unharmed.\n\nNow colored coins is not a sidechain, but it does share some of it\'s qualities and provides very tantalising and exciting insights into what sidechains could accomplish. Colored coins still use the blockchain though to conduct all transactions, wheras a sidechain would use it\'s own blockchain to store transactions, thus reducing transaction bloat, and would enable sidechains to completely redesign the structure of the blockchain for their own particular needs. As long as it retained enough information for the bitcoins that were assigned to the chain to be spent, so that both blockchains were able to recognise the spend when the bitcoin enters or leaves the sidechain, then they can create massively different sidechains for all manner of purposes, and the risk for these sidechains, as well as the people that dedicate bitcoins to these alts could be massively reduced.\n\nHopefully that makes it a little clearer.': 2, 'Enjoy a donuthole on me /u/changetip': 1, '2016': 2, "Newbie here, what's a sidechain?": 1, 'It provides an actually useful service (namely, decentralized VPN), and I can personally see precise situations where it would have helped me.': 2, 'Let me put it this way, Would you invest in a stock thats down 60% in the last year and rated as the worst investment of 2014?

As long as you wait 30 days before buying any more bitcoins, you can write off the loss per IRS rules (see below for link)\n\nSo for this reason I would expect to see people redeeming bitcoins at retailers, because (depending on the person\'s tax bracket) they could do their holiday shopping "free" with the proceeds from the write-off.  For example a 40 dollar item purchased with a bitcoin that was bought at ~three times the going rate will generate a tax savings greater than the 40 dollar cost of the item (assuming a $1200 bitcoin purchase price and a 40% tax bracket).\n\nThis is the first year bitcoin is going through this situation, as the IRS published rules around bitcoins and taxes back in March of this year: http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-14-21.pdf\n': 4, 'lol no': 2, 'As much as people want to believe it, Bitcoin is not the next internet, or world wide web for that matter.\n\nHopefully we can get some more realistic discussions on how to build a Bitcoin economy and create real demand based on use and adoption.': 0, 'Ya, holding for sure.': 1, "That's exactly the same thing people said in January too.": 1, 'This.\n\nTo compare bitcoin with the internet we are only just beginning to see VC investment and still using raw bitcoin addresses. \n\nIn 1994 The World Wide Web was introduced which (amongst other things) hid scary looking IP addresses underneath domain names.

In each block there are 25 new BTC currently. 25 is according to an algorithm which is set in the Bitcoin code (its opensource software which all of the peers in Bitcoin network run on their machines). If someone tries to make block with more than 25 BTC it will get rejected by all the other nodes in the network.\n\n> Are they "solutions" to the math equation?\n\nNo. New block is "the solution" ...but it is no \'math equation\' or \'hard mathematical problem\' as it is wrongly described in media. What is going on is that you (as a miner) take a hash (i.e. digestion) of the last block in blockchain and you basically try random numbers until you find the one that fits the criteria. No hard mathematical problems, it\'s more like lottery - with bigger computing power you have higher chance of finding the correct number. If you have the correct number, you new block is valid and will be spread across the network by other nodes and used by all miners.\n': 1, 'Third point: A bitcoin is NOT a solution to a math equation! The math equations have to be made to verify the transactions broadcasted during the last 10 minutes. Who ever (of the miners) finds the solution first, gets 25 bitcoins. And the 21M limit is written in the code. Whoever uses another code creates a new Bitcoin-Network (forks it).': 1, "My understanding regarding the coins themselves is that they are manipulable units associated with a particular key pair. These units are distributed as a reward for mining or as transaction fees for including blocks.\n\nThe 'equations' you're referring to are the actual work that the miners do to be rewarded (and to create the blocks that will then be included on the blockchain).": 1, 'Bitcoins are literally chains of references to previous transaction outputs.  These chains of references span multiple blocks in the blockchain, and every Bitcoin originates in a block reward (what a miner gets for solving a block hash first).  So you can think of it like in school, when a math teacher tells students to "show your work".  Each Bitcoin must be traceable to its original block, and each block is mathematically unique and impossible to replace (kind of like a piece in a puzzle).

All you are doing is moving the coins around on that ledger.  The solving math problem part comes into play when the miners work to put the transactions into a block and lock it into the ledger.\n\nSmarter mathematicians can't do anything to find an advantage to mine all the coins.  The reason is because the difficulty of these math problems adjust as the network grows.  Actually smart people did find ways to mine Bitcoins quicker already, using devices called ASICs (Application Specific Integrated Circuits), which are really fast computers to mine Bitcoins.
