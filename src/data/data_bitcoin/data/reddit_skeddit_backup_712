So much more that supercomputers are not worth thinking about, even if they are used for free.\n\nThe risk of centralization is independent of the cost of electricity.  Basically, large mining farms have some economies of scale that make them more profitable than smaller farms or independent miners.  With larger profits, they can upgrade their hardware faster than competitors, increasing the difference.  Since the amount of bitcoins that are paid daily to all miners is fixed, when one farm gets more bitcoins, the others get less.  Eventually the smaller and less profitable miners are forced to turn off their machines, so the larger ones get even more profitable.

Of course when anyone tries to do these "transactions without fees" in the real world, they always end up with less money after the transaction.

We will test wording such as "Mail a check instead" or "Donate with Check" in the same location on the page as "Donate with Bitcoin".

Like "oh, they take bitcoin? screw them!" or "oh, they take bitcoin? I better bounce out and acquire some, so I can pay that way." or - far fetched - maybe the form is slightly longer, with another link, causing just enough irritation to the potential donor.\n\nWhile there might be a little bit of the first (see: buttcoin), if I\'m hypothesizing then I think a bigger factor could be people are just curious about bitcoin so they click the link even though they don\'t have any.  At that point, they\'ve been sidetracked from the donation process, which can certainly lead to a fall in conversion - these are delicate processes and people are easily sidetracked like dogs by a squirrel.  They could easily investigate how much of a potential factor that is by seeing how many people actually click the bitcoin link without donating (for additional perspective you could then compare that to the loss rate of people who make it to the standard step 2), although that still wouldn\'t tell the whole story.  This all goes to say - visitor retention is a very delicate thing and they\'re right to be cautious about adding anything more than necessary to a donation landing page - particularly links that could derail someone from the process.\n\nAlso, it\'s worth pointing out that they aren\'t proposing any hypothesis as to why this is, although a lot of people here seem to be assuming it\'s "oh they\'re implying that people don\'t like bitcoin" and getting defensive.

Where a firm has a blanket authorisation, its employees are operating under its umbrella and it is responsible for any advice given by employees of that firm while they act as representatives of it. A key issue in the recent PPI mis-selling scandal was that staff not certified or trained to offer advice were recommending people take it (for whatever reason), and as these employees of their respective banks were operating under the banks' collective authorisation this shifted the liability for the sale from the seller personally to their employer, as they were doing so under the employer's regulatory permission to sell insurance and give advice, not their own. Where a person is individually authorised, on the other hand, they personally bear the responsibility for their advice and are responsible for making good any losses.\n\nThink about how things would work if that wasn't the case - there would be no downside to a firm collectively authorised to give advice just employing a heap of untrained simpletons and letting them give bad advice to customers, since the firm would get all the profit from the mis-selling and wouldn't have to pay actual advisers to sell stuff, but would have none of the liability for the duff advice their employees gave.\n\n(This is from a UK perspective, other jurisdictions may be different.)\n\n> I can see why the guy got sacked, since he lost them the investment and shouldn't have talked to the financial guy about anything, let alone bitcoin, but the client seems oddly skittish.\n\nThe client would probably have been taken aback by the firm employing someone who was willing to spout some fairly wacko political views at them, and pushing Bitcoin on them.

I would rather email them then post here\n\nIt's just a wallet created by a random Reddit user. ": 1, "The 12 word phrase is basically a master private key for all your private keys until the end of time.\n\nEven if you figure out how to export private keys from that phrase, be warned that BIP32 private keys can reveal all of the other keys if leaked, which is why most BIP32 wallets don't allow it.\n\nIf you ever figure out how to export your private keys or master public key, just know that you should treat each one of them as sensitive information.\n\nCombining the master public key with one of the private keys will reveal the master private key.\n\nI know it all sounds scary, but that is in fact WHY BIP32 HD wallets should only allow the seed (12 words) to be handled and treat it as one big private key.\n\nIf you must generate an individual address to give to someone, or for paper wallets to give away, DO NOT give away addresses derived from your seed. Generate a new one with bitaddress etc.": 3, 'It takes you through everything step by step, that phrase you wrote down is all you need to recover all your funds, new addresses are created for every transaction automatically and the wallet is secure.

Too bad Apple makes certain things (like this) difficult for us iOS users.': 1, "The wallet is very similar in concept to electrum. It also takes care of all your change addresses. So it's great for importing paper wallets. It swipes the pw and then moves it all to a new address. After every TX it moves the coins to a new private key so you're always safe. ": 2, "Addresses aren't reused. A new address is generated every time money is received. Although I would like to see eventually a feature added where you can give out a few addresses at a time. \n\nYou have access to your HD seed phrase which can generate addresses forever. So if you are an advanced user taking the right security precautions you can use that seed to generate addresses on a different system. ": 2, "Not sure if you noticed, but Voisine *is* bread wallet. You're getting it from the horse's mouth. Aaron's wallet does its best to eliminate users managing addresses and private keys, while keeping their coins secure. It might feel a bit weird letting these things stay under the hood, but you get used to it after a while. But as he warns, for large sums, manage your private keys in cold storage for the time being.": 3, "A new address is created every time you receive funds, and the wallet keeps your private keys secure on the keychain in the iPhone secure enclave. They are all generated from your backup phrase. The idea is that eventually users shouldn't have to understand or deal with or even see bitcoin addresses anymore than they do with IP addresses.\n\nIt's an open source project, so support is through github for now, but we'll be adding more user friendly support for the app.": 9, "I need to get deterministic builds working to make this easy to verify, but unfortunately thats not a simple task for ios. If I'm not able to get that working, the next best option is for others to build from source and examine the differences to make sure they are normal build differences and not due to source changes.": 2, "> So basically, I cannot create a new address? Addresses are reused?\n\nThe wallet handles new address creation to make sure they are not reused. \n\n> So I don't have access to the private keys?\n\nAll your private keys are available and can be generated from your backup phrase using BIP39 and BIP32.
