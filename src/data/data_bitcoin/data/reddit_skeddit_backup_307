Then, the fact that point-to-point downloads are a radically different thing to worldwide big P2P networks that require not just fast point-to-point downloads and uploads, but are also limited by the slowest connections and we want a diverse network for censorship-free, neutral currency (and also, flow through a densely connected network absolutely doesn\'t scale linearly with connection speeds much less if they are heterogeneous).\n\nThen there\'s also the implication that, even if huge blocks were possible, that it will be a good idea to allow them to grow that much when we don\'t know if it would be more beneficial to have block size controlled by some sort of fee-dependent mechanism. I think, to the contrary, that it\'s very narrow-minded to look for exactly the same kind of "optimisation" 20 years down the line having no possible way to know if that\'s what will be needed or whether it will necessarily be beneficial in terms of trade-offs. This is like assuming that speed limits had to be risen every few years past the first few decades because "technology is amazing, cars will be faster and safer forever" and we set up a fixed plan in the 1920s to double it every few years.\n\nShorter terms, I think it\'s also pointless to raise it 8-fold without any tests and having non-negligible orphan rates as is, and a growing gap between soft limits set by miners and the full size of the average block causing uncertainty in the number of blocks it takes to include certain txs.': 6, '> that they are only really running the real Bitcoin protocol if they are running bitcoin core\n\nWhich is understandable because the core consensus library is widely misunderstood. For example, most people don\'t have the faintest idea what "linking a library" means in the context of C code, or in Bitcoin\'s case `libconsensus`.\n\nThey don\'t understand that there\'s a difference between a full node, and `libconsensus`, or that it\'s the *behavior* of `libconsensus` that must be BUG FOR BUG compatible with the rest of the network for a full node to be *at all* safely adopted by Bitcoin miners who wish to avoid forking off the main network at an immense financial cost.\n\nWhen a miner solves a block, either that block is accepted or rejected by other miners - those miners all need to be running the same consensus library - which is called `libconsensus` to have any hope of succeeding in this endeavor.\n\nHence, the real concern is who controls `libconsensus`, because there can be only one libconsensus. You can link libconsensus, or you can try like mad to replicate it bug for bug in a different language, but you always come back to the miners - either the blocks recognized by your full node running your particular `libconsensus` agree with other miners, or your blocks aren\'t recognized by other miners. It\'s very binary.\n\nAnd just so we\'re clear, BitcoinXT\'s FAQ explicitly states Mike Hearn and Mike Hearn *alone* has dictatorial control over libconsensus - any changes he makes to it need to parotted by all other full nodes.': -3, ">All aboard the gravy train.\n\nThere.

As long as it continues to get cheaper to run a full node, and as long as bitcoin use remains widespread, the network will be completely resilient to any types of attacks that would be based on exploiting the set of full nodes directly.\n\nAnd by the way, why would you even run a full node if performing even a single transaction would cost you $20 or more?

Imagine Bitcoin Core doesn't fork to BIP101, and btcd *does* fork to BIP101. If indeed btcd's core consensus library differs from Bitcoin Core's consensus library, we in effect split the network with some miners mining blocks that are compatible with ruleset #1, and other miners mining blocks compatible with ruleset #2. Users and industry have the choice of moving to ruleset #2 if they so choose, however they are then STILL supporting ONE ruleset. It's just that they chose to move to a new one.\n\nOne currency, one ruleset - it's that simple.

We have btcd and it works quite well. I would even say it is much better in comparison to core because the code is better structured. The real issue is that many people have the false impression that they are only really running the real Bitcoin protocol if they are running bitcoin core. If there is a bug in bitcoin core which is not in btcd and would cause a fork everyone would say bitcoin core is nonetheless the correct fork.\n\nThat line of thinking is not really progressive and is even hindering progress to fix bugs. \n\nWould you say that you are surfing the real Internet only if you are browsing with Internet Explorer because it has the word Internet in the name? Internet Explorer did not comply with many Web standards just because it was the most used browser and thereby it could always claim that it is "THE Web standard". This led to much wasted development time of Web developers because they had to make sure that Web pages comply with the real Web standard AND with the "Internet Explorer Web standard" which contained a lot of bugs which were never fixed. \n\nI think Bitcoin development could progress much faster and more importantly much safer if the protocol specification is separated from specific client implementations. If there is just one reference implementation there is an increased likelihood of very dangerous bugs that could effect the whole system and bring it down. Another example is the OpenSSL library which was used everywhere so that a bug like heartbleed directly effects the whole Internet infrastructure. Just think about the consequences of a similar bug in Bitcoin. There is a real danger of centralized client development that many people just don\'t realize.

Ever since I was very young I loved computer programming. I contributed to the KDE open source project while in early High School for instance. My skill was noticed by a friend of my parents, and I was hired in grade 12, thus beginning my career in programing.\n\n> Later in life I realized I was very unhappy. While being just a business programmer in the enterprise world -- even in architect roles -- certainly got boring, what really made me unhappy was the horrible and quickly worsening state of the World. My experiences throughout life have finally led me to my true purpose; and that is where I am today.\n\n> I have quit my career, and I have dedicated myself to this project. Nothing will stop me from completing my life's work, my purpose in life. This is my calling.

Over the long run Bitcoin remittance should only really work if people are earning BTC directly and are able to send it to someone who can spend it directly without converting it to fiat at a cost.

I am not a historian.\n\nBut take the Weimar republic and their massive DMark hyper-inflation 'strategy'. This strategy successfully alleviated their obscene debt after WW I (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Versailles) and restored their economy to previous standards. Unfortunately, this success was used to fuel the next war effort - but the economy had been given a massive boon regardless.\n\nMore recently. The Greek debt crisis. The Greeks can't manipulate their currency (the Euro), because they need the consent of the EU - which they are not getting. Had they been able to print money, they would have been rid of their debt in little time, and could work on restoring their stagnant economy rather than paying off with what little profits they can muster. The Euro may very well turn out to becoming a failure if the zone fails to pull Greece out of that crisis - and currency manipulation might well be an easy, but ugly, swift solution.\n\nThen there's fractional reserve banking. In essence the total supply of money remains the same in this system, but it is possible for, essentially, multiple people to own the same money. This way, money supply is artificially higher while ownership is duplicated. This may result in a short-term boon to an economy; if different people are allowed to spend the same money then more economic activity may be present, boosting productivity, and boosting efficiency. But in the long run, this, too, needs to be repayed, which inevitably puts economic activity in a trough, which decreases productivity. The question here is: why is this system fair? And to who is it 'fairest'?\n\n----\n\nIt's all a massive earth-scale experiment. Bitcoin, the Euro, the USD, the Yuan and fiat in general, gold, something else on the horizon.

The BitFinex source code is based on the notoriously insecure Bitcoinica source code that was leaked in July, and one forum poster, Davout, found that one could use one of the same exploits against Bitfinex that worked against Bitcoinica when it was still operational: set the leverage to 10,000, put in a small amount of money, and wait for the price to move. If it moves even slightly down, the leverage effect ensures that the result will be immediate liquidation. If it moves up, however, the size of the account balance will jump up by ten thousand times the increase in the underlying BTC price, securing a profit margin far above 100%. Other issues, such as the use of floating point numbers (a form of binary scientific notation typically used to represent non-integer values in computers but known for their inexactness when trying to store decimal values) to store account balances, were also discovered. Even though Bitfinex\xe2\x80\x99s creator Raphael Nicolle claims that \xe2\x80\x9cBitfinex is now much more powerful and robust\xe2\x80\x9d, the discovery of such flaws so soon after Bitfinex\xe2\x80\x99s beta release bodes ill for such an otherwise promising startup\n\n>Secondly, the \xe2\x80\x9cno hot wallet\xe2\x80\x9d setup that is at the core of BitFinex\xe2\x80\x99s design, although admirable, has a problem of its own: if, over the course of one day, it happens that users are consistently buying more BTC than selling, or vice versa, then in order for BitFinex to be able to honor all of its users\xe2\x80\x99 positions it needs to step in and act as the counterparty to some of its users itself. This kind of setup is known as a bucket shop and is heavily frowned upon (and in many jurisdictions even illegal) because it creates perverse incentives \xe2\x80\x93 the shop can potentially make an order on the markets large enough to significantly bump the price up, liquidate all of its users who had opposite positions at high leverage, and keep all of their funds as profits. Even if Nicolle does not want to create a bucket shop, given a no hot wallet setup Bitfinex may have no choice but to periodically temporarily become one.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/3iccq1/bitfinex_frozen_again_for_btc/cuf7obm\n\nwithin the last 6 months bitfinex has already lost more than a quarter of its marketshare in the BTC USD market (as did okcoin btw) and the trend is still going down\n\nhttps://data.bitcoinity.org/markets/volume/24h/USD?c=e&r=hour&t=a\n\npros are moving\n\nhttp://www.dailytradingprofits.com/4819/the-bitfinex-glitch/\n\nand others too\n\nhttps://joettrader.wordpress.com/2015/08/25/bitfinex-fails-end-users-the-market-and-bitcoin-still-no-support-in-sight/\n\nthey move to bitsamp, ibit, bit-x which gained 66 - 185% in marketshare\nit will be interesting to see if the diversification adds to a more stable BTC price with less sudden crashes and all the fun': 1, "In this case a nonce would not make any difference since it's not double orders.

It's been around for six years, which is a lifetime in technology, and I'm still having trouble figuring out why the average Joe would use Bitcoin instead of paypal/visa/etc.\n\nCompare this with http: the first spec was written in 1991. Six years on, in 1997, roughly [25% of the American population](http://www.pewinternet.org/data-trend/internet-use/internet-use-over-time/) was browsing the internet. Http and html were the killer app that drove internet adoption across the world.\n\nAnd that's the problem for me when I read comments like this. For e-mail the utility was clear to everybody: send a letter to anybody, anywhere in the world, in seconds! So too for http/html: access a vast amount of information from all over the world! Read the news, chat with people, check your stocks, find recipies!\n\nNow try this with Bitcoin: send money to anyone in the world, quickly and cheaply! Sounds great, but when you think about this, most use cases are already covered by banks, credit card companies, and paypal. Buy something online? Use paypal, visa, or mastercard. Transfer money to another person? Just do a bank transfer (bank transfers are free in most European countries). That leaves remittances, but when you factor in the fees for buying/selling Bitcoin, even if you manage to save money, the added hassle rarely makes it worth it. \n\nSo whichever way you think about the _the average guy/gal simply has no use for Bitcoin_. And if people have to use for something, they're not going to go through the hassle of learning how to use it.\n\nIn this respect, Bitcoin and email _are_ very similar. People didn't get internet because they wanted to send messages to their cousins in Australia. They got internet because they wanted to browse the web. They got email in with the bargain, and as more and more people got email addresses, it started to be adopted as a new way to communicate with friends and family. In a way, http/html drove internet adoption, which in turn drove e-mail adoption. \n\nMaybe I'm wrong and I'm missing something, but from I can tell Bitcoin is lacking a clear driver for adoption.
