Then you can point to their reputation for a particular version of their code and keep your (only CSS/HTML updates) separate to prove that all you\'re doing is modifying the style and not the core logic of the thing. No one needs to "trust" CSS, so your only need is to pull out the javascript and prove you didn\'t change any of it to make it malignant.\n': 1, "1. Your site has no https or ssl, meaning I can't validate I'm actually connecting to you, any middle man could send me different data and I have to check the whole source every time I visit the page (all 10k lines). If you kept the javascript files separate, I could confirm the hashes of each one and check to see if they change, but it's all lumped together, so if even if I check the whole thing, you can change a single character and my stored hash changes, meaning I have to re-check the 10k lines.\n\n2. I don't trust you, why should I? Bitaddress has a much longer history than you. You wouldn't trust an executable that I posted somewhere, so why would anyone trust the code you have, when you can change it at any time? There's a reason bitcoind uses deterministic builds. \n\nI'm saying that you shouldn't be hosting this, bitaddress can't really confirm your version is valid as you have merged all the files into one html file and made a lot of changes to it. Even if they do, why should they risk their reputation by saying it's valid when you can insert code to steal the keys at any time?\n\nIf you want to commit to bitaddress, then clone their repo, change it, commit and issue a pull request. Github has lots of tutorials available. ": 3, 'Very nice and easy. Just two suggestions:\n\n1. put the addresses on one line rather than breaking them into several, perhaps underneath the QR code?\n2. get rid of the colourful dots after the required entropy was created in order to keep the interface free of distraction. In any case, definitely get rid of them when the addresses are printed.\n\nJust my two pennies....': 5, "Because a hacker could do many things on your computer - it's best to take the source code, put it on a offline computer (never been online), and run the site from that computer.

Ask yourself what benefit does having a logo that big do for anyone viewing the page. Does it make the rest of the content easier to read or does it do a better job putting your name on someone else\'s work (bitaddress). Not to mention it has poor anti-alisasing and looks awful at my screen resolution. You say that it would not fit otherwise, maybe that is because you put it front and center. If it were off to the left, it wouldn\'t look bad at a significantly smaller size. Hell you (or I) could probably make it work in the center too. But you made bad decisions around it as well which don\'t help its placement.\n\n> The typography is much better than what it was\n\nNo. The second element (and largest text) on your page is things not everyone would understand despite your focus on being user friendly. "Your bitcoin address" and "Your private key". Rather than emphasize what matters, the fact that one should be shared and one shouldn\'t like bitaddress did; you again focus on poor design choices.\n\n> I chose the fonts to for the needs, instead of going with the defaults.\n\nA default serif would be the font the majority of your page text uses. It\'s almost like you neglected the description despite how little content you actually have. There is also an uneven margin/padding around perimeter of the two columns. Again for someone so design conscious, you seem to have neglected a lot of things that make the layout more comfortable for the user.\n\n> Colors are very subjective, but still improvements were made.\n\nYou have two comically large blue buttons with black text for the label. The blue/black is a poor juxtaposition of color as far as readability goes. The border is also so close to the background color of the buttons it blends in albeit badly. This is an eyesore and should always be avoided. I also don\'t understand the massive margin on the bottom of the page. Have you set a static height? Again, a poor choice. If your logo weren\'t so massive there would be no need for the user to scroll anyways.\n\nOh and almost forgot my favorite part. You took someone else\'s work, offered no attribution on your page and even had the nerve to slap your own address on there (bolded too) for donations. What exactly did you do to deserve donations besides rebrand someone else\'s work? You didn\'t even remove any of the unused code which has a big affect on page load times.\n\nDon\'t try to polish a turd man. Just accept that you don\'t know as much about design as you think you do. I don\'t think you have studied design, or even been involved long enough to know what matters.\n\n**tl;dr** Baby\'s first web design, can\'t accept it looks like shit': 1, "Thanks for the ELI5 on https.\r\r\rIt looks like I misunderstood and am confused the purpose of github in your comment.

In this case, since /u/robbdiggs is new to this field, even if I know (via HTTPS certificate) that I'm connecting to the real robbdiggs, I don't have any assurance that every request he sends different scripts down, and would have to check the content each time.

That applies to the font weight, colors used, size of the circles, etc. That's the reason it's big. If the logo were small, I would not fit the overall look of the page.\n\nThe typography is much better than what it was. I chose the fonts to for the needs, instead of going with the defaults. For example, the keys themselves are laid out in a much more readable format with those line breaks. For it to appear tidy and to complement the squareness of the QR code, I used a monospaced font. There is also a deliberate attempt to put less text on the page. Typography is about communication, and my version is more direct with less technical details and fluff.\n\nColors are very subjective, but still improvements were made. The palette, like the typography, is intentional and cohesive, rather than default blue text links and gray buttons, paired with muddy green and orange. My colors are bright and festive. They're emotive rather than passive.\n\nAbout the styling \xe2\x80\x94 look again. Bitaddress has a noisy layout with lots of code, and paragraphs of text that you don't want to read.

The layout is stronger: there's a obvious center arrangement.\n\nUser friendliness. I didn't say it was perfect, but it's definitely more user friendly.

The first one is just password protecting a private key, which is awesome in itself.  But the other one is that you can use a password to generate a temporary code that you can give to another person, which they can use to make an encrypted private key for you that they could not have had access to the original private key in order to make.  So somebody else can make an address for you.  The purpose of that was for casascius\'s physical coins.  And since the encrypted private key includes a nonce called "owner entropy" which you provide in your temp code you give them, you can verify that the encrypted private key they gave you was created via that method and isn\'t just some random other encrypted private key they do have access to.\n\n(I\'m teaching myself python, and as part of my learning, I implemented the full BIP0038 specification in Python, so I know all about the ins and outs of bip38.

At that point, we are talking about complete destruction of the network.  As in bitcoin would fail. At that point, if you change the algorithm to exclude the attacker, it doesn't matter, because your system is toast.  You instantly loose value and utility in giant orders of magnitude.

We should be taking the possibility of future attacks for granted. With a PoW attack, you can either increase a competing PoW by buying more hardware to reduce the attacker\'s power, or mitigate the hashing attack in some other way by cutting the PoW attacker out of the network, or in the worst case, switching the hashing algorithm and making their hardware investment completely worthless, without actually screwing with everyone\'s money, since the Proof and the Money are separate ("decentralized" if you will). If someone with the largest stake decides to attack, it\'s not that easy to mitigate, since to reduce their power you either have to buy out their coins with something else (which will make them richer, or they can simply refuse to do), or you have to change the stake algorithm that cuts them, and their money, out of the system, which I\'m not sure is possible if all the coins are supposed to be fungible.\n\n> In Proof of stake, in order to attack the network, you would need to hold more than 50% of the actual coin. So if you act maliciously you would kill your own value by destroying something that you hold and then can\'t dump.\n\nAs explained, killing your own value, is not a problem if you do it slowly, and convert it into other assets as you kill it. If PoS becomes the dominant system, even if you can\'t inflate it, you can slowly increase your own control of assets, such as property, gold, stocks, or other currencies, while decreasing your own and **everyone else\'s** value, resulting in a situation where you go from owning 51% stake in a currency while the world owns the other 49%, to you owning 90% of the world\'s assets while the rest of the world, made poorer by your attack, owns 10%.\n\n> It also reduces power across the board because you aren\'t wasting work on ridiculously difficult problems.\n\nThere is a theory I\'ve been pushing around: Proof of X to incentivise X. Proof of most efficient calculation using the most efficient energy source (hashing) incentivises creating more efficient processors and creating more efficient energy sources. This is evident by the fact that 28nm technologies were being developed by Intel and AMD with plans to be rolled out in October of this year, but thanks to Bitcoin mining and millions invested in ASIC development, 28nm was pushed out onto the market way back in March, accelerating the overall processor technology speeds by almost a year. Now, every year that you use a faster computer or a faster smartphone, you will thank Bitcoin that the device you are using is not as slow as devices were almost a year ago. Likewise the energy incentive is getting people to look for cheapest sources of energy on the planet. MaidSafe\'s proof of online-accessible hard drive storage will likewise lead to faster internet connections and cheaper methods of data storage. Here, with the proof of stake, the incentive is basically to have the highest stake, which in the long run can only lead to more and more people doing everything they can to concentrate wealth. There is no such incentive in a Proof of Work system, and concentration of mining power, while creating a threat of concentration of control, is not the same as a concentration of wealth, especially since in bitcoin mining, the incentives are to get costs of mining as close to revenues from mining, and thus profits from mining as close to 0 as possible.': 2, "That's great and all, but what does Ja Rule think of Bitcoin?": 14, '> Proof of stake is a significant jump in security\n\nYes, a jump backwards.': 1, "All the negatives you point out are applicable to POW as well.  \n\nAlso, I am not sure why you are talking about inflation here.  Inflation is not the issue as it is hard programmed into the algorithms and you can assess them yourself as they are open source if the coin is worth anything.\n\nWhen security of a crypto-coin network is assessed you have to think about things from a cost of attack standpoint.  Right now if you wanted to attack the bitcoin network, you could do so by purchasing hardware.  You would need to purchase or control enough hardware to equal more than 50% of the network, but there would be a specific cost associated with that.  It would cost you a lot of money.  But once you control that level of power, you could then attack the network in a number of ways.  The issue with POW is that after you did this, your hardware is still good.  You could then sell the hardware or point it at a different coin.  You haven't lost a thing, and you could even profit from shorting the market in the meantime.  \n\nIn Proof of stake, in order to attack the network, you would need to hold more than 50% of the actual coin.  So if you act maliciously you would kill your own value by destroying something that you hold and then can't dump.  It also promotes participation in the network because you can't gain stake if you don't run a node.  So, you have a lot more regular participants.  You don't need an ASIC to run a node, you just need any shitty machine with a internet connection.  \n\nIt also reduces power across the board because you aren't wasting work on ridiculously difficult problems.  \n\nThe only argument against proof of stake that actually makes sense is that it concentrates wealth.

Say you own 52% of the coin which cost you millions or billions of dollars to purchase. Then say you attack that coin to give yourself more coin... At the point of attack, the value of all the coin goes down... \n\nIt won\'t go down to zero. People aren\'t going to abandon all their money. So, let\'s say I create 2% more coin. The value of all coins goes down to 98% due to inflation that I created, and maybe another % due to the initial panic. I wait for the panic to subside (since, again, people won\'t abandon their money and the systems built to use it), and then of that 2% that I created, spend 1% to buy something. I now have an asset I didn\'t have before, but still have a 52% majority of the coins, since I gave 1% away and kept 1% for myself. The distribution didn\'t change basically, and I\'m still in complete control. Then, I create another 2% of the coins, and again use 1% to buy more stuff while keeping the other 1%. On and on. People get used to the inflation, and price only decreases due to inflation and not panics, and I can pretty much create money for myself to buy whatever I want indefinitely, as long as I always keep at least half of what I create. This is why central banks and governments can keep getting wealthier, despite inflating the currency they have the most stake in (i.e. they control it and depend on it). Like government, I would be able to buy whatever I want, for as long as I want, as long as I don\'t inflate the currency I control into hyperinflation. I hope that makes sense.\n\n> Those are the same problem which you just proposed the same solution to, and in both cases the solution you proposed would destroy the currency. Being fungibile is absolutely critical to the success of any coin.\n\nI don\'t think so... If Bitcoin is attacked by 51% of ASIC mining power to the point where no other miners can do anything, those other miners are effectively screwed (lost everything), at which point we switch the algorithm to, say, Scrypt, and the attacker is screwed just as much. Mining resumes on other hardware, and everyone\'s money stays put. If a PoS system is attacked by a 51% owner, I don\'t know how you can change the algorithm to make that attacker\'s "proof," which is essentially their money, worthless...

It has it's strengths and weaknesses as a payment network (and about to be outdone in some ways by it's own payment revolution that it has arguably kicked-off. . . apple, paypal, google, CC's, etc.); but it is not even debatable whether it is currently acting as a payment network.

It will take some time, before regular users can outmuscle the speculators. ": 1, "I appreciate people trying to explain this to me, and I really am not trying to be obtuse, but I can't help but point out the inconsistencies that remain:\n\nBitcoin is not yet a currency.  By any meaningful definition.  It serves two of three standard functions to a limited degree, and does not serve at all as the third; a unit of account.  Unit of account means that bitcoin does not just have one price; but millions and billions of prices (i.e. every good and service available for sale for BTC, in fact prices the bitcoin unit; a bitcoin's price might simultaneously be: 1 ford focus, .025 houses, 1.5 years tuition at State U, 22,543 apples, 1,000 sessions of yoga, etc, etc.).  Right now, bitcoin is not unit of account.  It has but one price at any given time; $479 US Dollars right now (yes, and other currencies, but they are all liquid monies, not non-homogeneous goods and thus are arbitraged to effectually be the same price).  No goods or services that I know of are priced in bitcoin.  They are priced in fiat, and bitcoin is used as proxy; a payments rail for transferring fiat.   And that's great.  Not disparaging that.  But bitcoin is not money.  It's value does not float independently of other currencies.   \n\nOther than needing to get more user/security friendly, it is already performing marvelously as a payments system.  Sure it's not as widespread as paypal, but for Thiel to be saying that the measure of bitcoin success is to be a more widespread payment system, like paypal: that means bitcoin is already becoming successful. . . so he is essentially saying that for bitcoin to be successful, it needs to be more successful.  Does't really make sense.  And I'm still dubious that he would use the wording that he did, to mean what you all say he is meaning.  He said bitcoin is money and needs to be a payment system, pretty clearly.  \n\nI can't see how someone as smart as Peter Thiel, does not see the importance both the potential of bitcoin becoming its own monetary unit; and the speculation that is inevitable (given it's non-status as money, but it's potential to become one).  I really don't think he's dumb enough to compare the two; paypal and bitcoin; and to not see the fundamental differences in their nature and makeup and stated aims of the early adopters and creators. . . .but apparently I'm wrong.\n\nHe wouldn't be the first public figure to take an odd, underhanded, and seemingly non-sequitur swipe at bitcoin, and the crypto-anarchist, anti-state anti-fed monetary ethos surrounding the movement.\n\nThere's a very distinct push and propaganda being spread that wants to domesticate bitcoin. . . and it isn't going to happen.  Bitcoin will be valued for what it is (not friendly to central control), or it will fail.  There is no neutering it to payment system only.  It's all or nothing.": 2, 'If that\'s the case, then sure, I understand the argument. . . but the language that he used to convey that was completely wrong, frankly.  He said bitcoin was a money, but needs to be a payment system. . . that is exactly not the case, by any definition of those words that we would have context to understand.\n\nNow, given his real meaning; he is still very wrong, seeing as how speculation is a necessary and indispensable process to fully capitalizing the market, and getting the commodity demanded widely enough for it to mature into end-to-end use and develop unit of account valuation.  Bitcoin does not get a government decreeing it money and forcing everyone to use it (and that is a good thing. . . but it means that people need to actually understand how market processes work, and not expect pricing and capitalization to occur in what they perceive as a clean and orderly manner).  I\'m sorry, but it\'s like Peter Thiel took economics from the occupy wall street crowd.  Great intentions. . . poor theoretical framework. . . asinine conclusions.  \n\nRegular users do not need to "outmuscle" the speculators.  Regular users are speculators.  Regular use is a lot of things for a lot of different people.  For bitcoin to have and maintain value, people need to be allowed to valuate it how they please and for the reasons they see it as valuable.  This is not a zero-sum game.  The fluctuations don\'t affect you if you are just using bitcoin as a payments rail anyways.  So that argument is bunk on it\'s face.  \n\nThe only possible way for bitcoin to actual begin to circulate as a money, necessarily requires a great deal more speculation and volatility, the likes of which we haven\'t even seen yet.': 7, 'There are no proofs, only falsifications.': 3, "I am Satoshi.\n\nI happen to like Peter Thiel.

Despite the initial tone of my post, I do think that speculation is indispensable in order for price discovery to work. That speculation is demonized today, is because people simply cannot think objectively about the subject. And there is indeed an overlap between regular use and speculation. And most people criticising speculation don\'t even see this distinction and see all speculation as negative manipulation.\n\nHaving said that, I don\'t think there\'s anything particularly wrong with what Peter Thiel stated. I do not even believe he was really criticizing the speculation aspect. He was merely giving an observation of what constitutes success. And I happen to agree with that observation. The endgame with bitcoin is for people to regularly transact. This is basically what we all want. For bitcoin to be used just like euro and dollars in our daily lives. Speculation is an intermediate step to this endgame.\n\nAlso, while I agree that there\'s an overlap between speculators and regular users, they are not entirely the same. But that all depends on context and what your definition of "regular" is. When I speak of regular users, I mostly mean people that don\'t even take price into consideration and just use the damn system as money and transact. Sometimes I use "regular" in a different context (like the one you just used), but mostly this is how I see regular users.

The idea was: it's not the internet's payment winner until it wins the market, beating X.com and the others. (According to the book PayPal Wars.) So he probably figures bitcoin hasn't accomplished anything like this yet.\n\nWhat PayPal lacked was being truly their own currency, which all would agree PayPal is not and bitcoin is ... Yes it is volatile but its value floats independently of any other currency.\n\nAll that said, I also was initially surprised with his comments since I actually feel like it functions successfully at some level as both otherwise people wouldn't choose to engage with it as both.
