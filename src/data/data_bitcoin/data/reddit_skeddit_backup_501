Especially not where once the double-spend is detected the party responsible is still around (in attendance at the concert, with seat number known) to be questioned.\n\nThere are a couple of attacks affecting zero confirmation.  The race attack is unreliable but let\'s say you were able to succeed 50% of the time.  So what you would end up with after two attempts is two tickets that you paid full price for $300, and two tickets that you got using coins you later double spent.  You are still out $300.  Maybe you could scalp those four tickets and maybe earn a little profit, but that\'s a lot of work and risk for the money.   Either way, Hagar is probably happy you did your little scam since concerts don\'t always sell out and this probably earned them $300 in revenue they might not otherwise have seen.\n\nAn example of a zero confirmation transaction that isn\'t safe would be perhaps a coin change machine at a laundromat where the cash-out rate is spot price.    If your attempts only succeed one out of ten times, you can still easily make a profit because there is no cost to trying and you can keep trying indefinitely (in theory, since the laundromat is unattended).   So you try the race attack over and over.  Sure you\'ll end up with a lot of change from the machine but the whole time you\'ll be earning 10% profit (assuming 1 out of ten success rate, which may be high or low -- it is hard to tell).\n\nSo, zero confirmation is, today, pretty safe for most types of in-person transactions.

How are you going to get significant sales out of a group that, at present, constitutes a tiny portion of the population? If you don't have a great reason why Bitcoin uniquely enables your business, it's probably not worth dealing with at this time unless you enjoy being an extremely early adopter. Examples of when merchant adoption makes sense:\n\n1) Commerce is difficult or impossible without the benefits Bitcoin provides (black markets)\n\n2) Anonymity is an issue (VPNs, porn, seedboxes, local regs)\n\n3) Your country or customer base is largely unbanked or unserved by credit card companies and Paypal\n\n4) You're a very large merchant so the economies of scale make it worthwhile, and even if they don't yet it's worth investing in training now to get your corporation ready for when Bitcoin is more ubiquitous (Overstock.com, NewEgg, Dell, Microsoft)\n\n5) There's a concentration of local bitcoin-accepted businesses in your area, so that bitcoiners will go out of their way to visit (Berlin, Ghent, wherever else)\n\n6) You want to have an image of being on the cutting edge of technology, or you're just interested in Bitcoin, especially if you won't be converting much to fiat\n\n7) You're an online business that relies (or could rely) significantly on small payments or tips\n\n8) You cater specifically to the Bitcoin community\n\n9) You hope to make use of the programmable money aspects of Bitcoin\n\nNotice that none of these apply to a typical small goods retailer in the West.": 3, 'I had this same problem in florida during the St. Petersburg Bowl this past year. A bunch of merchants accepted bitcoin (via Bitpay unfortunately), and at one pizza shop there were three, count them, THREE, grown men standing around a tablet trying to learn how to do this weird internet money thing. There was a paper on the wall Bitpay gave them how to accept bitcoin. It felt forced. They never did get it working. The first sentence in satoshis paper is that online commerce has come to rely up third parties, Bitpay was the third party in this scenario.

But after a few visits it works like clockwork.\n\nBut trust me it will get better.

Turning away customers is never a good idea, and I think that was OP's point.": 0, "The fact is there just aren't many people who use bitcoin. Assuming there are 1/2 million users then roughly 1 in 14,000 people worldwide use Bitcoin. Do donut shops even get that many unique customers in a year? When you also consider the number of people whose only interest in Bitcoin is playing the markets or buying drugs it's not too surprising that random brick and mortar stores aren't getting all that much in Bitcoin sales. To be honest, if a donut shop claimed to be getting $1,000's of dollars worth of Bitcoin sales a year I'd assume they were using the business to launder their own coins. \n\nHaving said all that I am surprised it took this long to get even a single Bitcoin-paying customer. There's a bar in my city that accepts it and I went there a few times just for the novelty. Each time it was a real headache because it involved waiting ten minutes for the bartender to find the ipad and then listen to him bust my balls about paying with monopoly money while I tried desperately to get my spotty service to connect so I could complete the transaction. I've been friends with the bartender for years so it was all in good fun, but if I wasn't I would've felt particularly awkward being the asshole that wastes so much time during a busy happy hour instead of just paying with cash, which is exactly how I pay when I go there nowadays. \n\nTo add to this, one of the waitresses flat out told me the owners decision to accept Bitcoin was a pr move. I mean, it definitely worked somewhat for them because I dropped around $500 there I probably wouldn't have otherwise, and from what I'm told they've had about 5 other customers who occasionally come in too. \n\nPs while I'm telling my Bitcoin-brick-and-mortar story there's another issue people need to understand if they're going to pay with Bitcoin. This applies only to bars, but many require you to hand over a credit card if you want to open a tab. Apparently some of the other patrons raised a fuss over this because they thought they were exempt from this policy simply because they were paying in Bitcoin. Just something for people to keep in mind if you ever find yourself going to whatever bar in your area accepts Bitcoin.

The reason merchants either drop Bitcoin or their employees don\'t know how to accept it is because there is simply no one using it.\n\nBitcoin Black Friday 2013 was *amazing*.
