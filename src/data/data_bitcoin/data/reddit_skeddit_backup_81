(In other words, I did only the fun parts)\n\nThe idea of using a ZKP to turn want-of-x to want-of-preimage is something I came up with several years ago-- and I consider it one of the more clever tricks I\'ve ever come up with--, but lack of an efficient ZKP frustrated actually implementing it. When libsnark was finally released I made a go of implementing it but got stuck waiting them to release the sha256 circuit they authored (which replacing would be a large amount of work); then again in dec 2014 when someone else released a sha256 circuit, but the holidays ran out before I could finish.\n\nSean\'s work on Zcoin has him more directly working with these constructs-- since they\'re also the building blocks for Zerocash; and he had the determination to see it through. I sent him my previous exploration, talked through a little of it-- but mostly he was on his own with much of the details (...especially since the recent climate has made it hard for me to accomplish much of anything).

Their private key from the global PKI infrastructure which authenticated their website also happed to sign the delivery acknowledgement.\n\nTLS streams don't prove anything except that someone with the given public key was running a web server, because TLS doesn't provide non-repudiation.  The client and server use the PKI to create a master secret that is then used to generate shared keys for encryption and authentication.  Because the keys are shared, the authentication doesn't prove anything to third parties.  To be a little more concrete:\n\n1. Client and server use PKI to generate shared secrets including an HMAC key HK1.\n2. Server sends an encrypted message M plus HMAC(HK1,M).\n3. Client computes HMAC(HK1,M) independently and checks that it matches.\n\nNothing stops the client from computing HMAC(HK1,M2).  This is secure against third-party attacks because only the client and server know HK1 (unless one of them blabbed) but it doesn't prove which of the parties authenticated the message.\n\n> Maybe something like tlsnotary would work for this.\n\ntlsnotary appears to be a clever strategy in which an Auditor and Auditee mutually pose as one client, with an interactive protocol that allows Auditee to commit to the HMAC output before learning the HMAC key.  This allows the Auditee to prove to the Auditor that the server said X.  It doesn't prove anything to fourth parties who don't trust the Auditor.  It doesn't allow the Auditor to be the type of verification program in play here, because it is inherently interactive.\n\nOf course, for the ZKCP, the parties could agree on the public key of a trusted Auditor and allow that Auditor to sign a message whose contents the verifier would accept.  However, it is then three parties, not two, and loses most of the advantage over simpler escrow.": 1, "You can have them put up a bond in multisig escrow-- though they risk having it held up; similarly, reputation can be used if it's an application space where there is much repeat buying.\n\nIt even without it still _works_ but you'd need to assume that the solver doesn't care about that risk, this would be the case if the solver has an especially efficient secret solution; and doesn't mind a some parties canceling out. In other words, in that case, it's no longer trustless-- but still reduced trust compared to not using the ZKCP at all. ": 3, 'Can someone eli5 or point me to a resource on this?

This means you could write your program and compile it to the bytecode with a pretty ordinary compiler. The downside is that this method has high overhead, I think the record for the prover speed for this has the virtual CPU running at about 10Hz.   OTOH, the proof generation is embarrassingly parallel and could be hardware accelerated (I spent some time looking into fabricating an ASIC for that a while back).\n\nThere is no fundamental reason it should be hard though-- it's primary a question of tool maturity. And a little bit of a chicken and egg situation; without applications to drive tool maturity they tend to remain fairly academic. At least for cases where the prover doesn't need to be ultra fast, there is no reason why ordinary software couldn't just be compiled to it, without any specialized knowledge.\n\nFor high performance proving, it's harder-- normal programming languages have dynamic accesses to mutable memory and data dependent loop bonds which don't map very efficiently to circuits.

But generally, this gives a very efficient and private way to conduct a broad subset of all possible smart contracts.\n\nAn interesting point is that you can actually understand the lightning network as an efficient subclass of this protocol (though its development history was different)-- in fact the transaction we used on the blockchain here is identical to one of the lightning proposals.

Physical randomness is better than computer generated pseudo-randomness. The easiest way to generate physical randomness is with dice. To create a Bitcoin private key you only need one six sided die which you roll 99 times. Stopping each time to record the value of the die. When recording the values follow these rules: 1=1, 2=2, 3=3, 4=4, 5=5, 6=0. By doing this you are recording the big random number, your private key, in B6 or base 6 format.

Changes will be applied to our shipping process during this sale. There will be a Value Added Tax applied on arrival to all orders made to international customers. This is not a new cost but we are providing more details about what each customer should expect when placing their order.\n\n\nThe responses we have from our customers is fantastic and we will work hard to provide our community with the most secure and easy to use bitcoin wallet.

By setting nLockTime this\n    // way we\'re basically making the statement that we only want this\n    // transaction to appear in the next block; we don\'t want to potentially\n    // encourage reorgs by allowing transactions to appear at lower heights\n    // than the next block in forks of the best chain.\n    //\n    // Of course, the subsidy is high enough, and transaction volume low\n    // enough, that fee sniping isn\'t a problem yet, but by implementing a fix\n    // now we ensure code won\'t be written that makes assumptions about\n    // nLockTime that preclude a fix later.\n    txNew.nLockTime = chainActive.Height();\n\n    // Secondly occasionally randomly pick a nLockTime even further back, so\n    // that transactions that are delayed after signing for whatever reason,\n    // e.g. high-latency mix networks and some CoinJoin implementations, have\n    // better privacy.\n    if (GetRandInt(10) == 0)\n        txNew.nLockTime = std::max(0, (int)txNew.nLockTime - GetRandInt(100));\n\nSo if the current best block is 400000 when we send a transaction, we set the nLockTime on the transaction to 400000, which means the transaction cannot be included in any block with height less than 400001.\n\nOur transaction has a huge fee and gets mined in block 400001. A rogue miner decides they want the fee, so they try to mine a new block 400001. Our nLockTime doesn\'t stop them doing that. All it does is stops them from putting in it a new block 400000 or lower, but they wouldn\'t be wanting to do that anyway as far as I can see.\n\nAlso, is this a typo?\n\n> we discourage this practice as the height restricted and limited blocksize gives miners\n\nIt\'s not clear what they\'re trying to say, but it doesn\'t sound right to me. Maybe "height restriction"?': 1, "This description isn't quite right.\n\nAs a miner you can, technically, choose where to mine: You could extend the tip or you could attempt to orphan it.  If it was created by someone other than you and you orphan it, you get your pick of the fees that are in it, as well as your pick of the fees that have been created after it.\n\nIf fees overall are lucrative relative to subsidy (and subsidy geometrically declines to zero over time), AND if the block size limit is large compared to the amount of high-fee transactions (which currently is, and probably will be in the future unless fees become far more isotropic)-- then it can be in your short term economic best interest to attempt to orphan, and let some other suckers worry about moving the chain forward (or let it only move forward when some miner gets multiple blocks in a row).\n\nBy locking new transactions to the current tip, a miner who chooses to orphan can only take the fees in that block-- he can't also take the best of the fees that have been created later. ... so the incoming stream of transactions that can't yet be mined in the vulnerable-to-orphaning block is a material incentive to move the chain forward, even if transaction fees are large compared to the subsidy.\n\nIt's not very important today, but as subsidy declines it will be more important... and it's a step better than only being able to count on the block size limit to protect against bad incentives here. (otherwise the only personal incentive to not mine-in-place within the system when another miner finds a block is that eventually there will be a backlog of two blocks worth of very high fee transactions and there will be no more reason to not move forward since the size limit would prevent you from taking any more fees in the prior block than you would get from the current block).\n\nWe do have other tools being researched to further security against these long term concerns; the tip-locktime was just the most simple to deploy now. For example, if you know there already exists N * BLOCKSIZE_LIMIT worth of unconfirmed transactions paying higher fees than yours, you should locktime your transaction to N blocks out; or better-- even if your fee is higher but you don't care about fast confirmation-- just to encourage forward motion of the chain.  There are also cryptographic techniques that can be used to prevent miners taking the fees from transactions they only learned about via a block; and a proposal that lets miner share fees forward-- so when they collect fees higher than the remaining mempool they can share them with subsequent miners... and so on.. But these are things which are still the subject of ongoing research.\n\nThe locktiming at the tip has no real cost those using it, only potential benefits... so it's an obvious win. It also has the additional benefit of making sure that wallets are tested against locktimed transactions-- something that was often broken before core started doing this.": 12, 'Could you explain what you mean by fee sniping?

The reason you see a lot of *(MAX-1)* nSequences on the network is *below (MAX)* on at least one input is required for the nLocktime field to be consensus enforced.  Bitcoin Core uses nLocktime to help prevent [fee sniping](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2340) (not a serious issue today with high block subsidies to transaction fee ratios, but a good measure to implement now so that it becomes standard policy as the subsidy drops, average fees per bytes increases, and block sizes grow) and because more transactions are spending `OP_CLTV`-protected outputs which require the spending transaction set nLocktime.\n\n3.
