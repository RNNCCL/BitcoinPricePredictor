And it\'s a great attention-getting headline. Got me to actually read the article, and I\'m glad I did. Just a short ways in, I\'m already nodding at the decision to write an api to separate hosting your own node from your core service. It\'s a nice move to make it flexible for scalability and resilience, although, of course, one could certainly hope that the underlying bitcoin core node would never have a hiccup (I\'ve had good luck on a small scale running a tipbot with the underlying daemon not having issues, but I can certainly see wanting flexibility there).\n\nOne spelling mistake:\n\n> ACID complaint\n\n*compliant\n\nOne comment here:\n\n> In case of a 3rd party API they can generate private key and bitcoin address for you so you would need to store them securely or at least encrypt them in the database.\n\nIt seems to me like it\'s worth mentioning the inherent security risk in this, in that the 3rd party obviously could choose to store that private key themselves...\n\n> IMPORTANT! Here is a risk for a race condition. In the bitcoin network 2 blocks can be found literally at the same time which means you will receive blocknotify twice right away and during your business logic operations some unknown consequences may happen. To avoid it your callback URL defined method should be executed synchronously, for example in a queue.\n\nInteresting consideration. Are you talking about two blocks with the same block number, rather than two consecutive blocks? I would think you mean the former, since the latter would be relatively easy to address with a little bit of logic (for instance, only move the transaction to confirmed when processing exactly the third block confirming it; of course, this requires that you are 100% sure you will process each and every block, but that should be reasonable). For the former case then, it seems to me like it would be possible to have some type of staging step which ensured unique blocks, although once I start to think about that, I start to see some unfortunate possibilities (my naive solution was to say each block number can only be processed once, but what if the first version of that block number which you receive becomes orphaned, so then you\'re locked into processing the wrong block? And it would be possible for the third confirmation thus to come in two different blocks. However, possibly this wouldn\'t matter, as in the case I\'m imagining it\'s not a block reorganization, so either one would be fine from the perspective of confirming those transactions from two blocks prior; definitely food for thought for me).\n\n> Which database is best is a spicy topic and worth of it\xe2\x80\x99s work paper or book.\n\n*worthy of *its [own] work paper or book\n\n(I might also suggest \'whitepaper\' rather than \'work paper\', but it\'s certainly possible I\'m just not personally familiar with the latter phrase and that it\'s reasonable here)\n\n> Otherwise you can end up with adding balance twice, deleting accidentally records or simply break database schema. \n\nJust a quibble basically about parallel structure, merely a matter of taste: "adding a balance twice, accidentally deleting records, or simply breaking the database schema."\n\nExcellent post; thank you!

Instead, the limit should be based on what the network is technically capable of. If 60% of these Chinese mining pools are self-governing and limiting their own blocks, that in and of itself is going to create a higher demand for fees. It's unfair to give 60% of miners a vote over 100% of all other miners though, especially when we can't really say for sure that 100% of the users of these pools agree with the 8MB proposal.
