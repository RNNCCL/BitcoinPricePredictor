The emphasis on state-chartered banking dates back to the farmer-populist political movement best personified by William Jennings Bryan; farmers thought that, if banks were forced to remain local (by banning them from opening branches in other states), the banks would be forced to lend to those around them, most notably, farmers. The result was one of the world's most unstable banking systems, because the banks couldn't diversify their risks. If housing in Michigan had a downturn, then every bank in Michigan (which could only invest in Michigan) would have a run on the bank as people expected them to fail. The way to solve this problem, since the politics of local banking was so entrenched, was first through the Federal Reserve (intended to provide capital in the event of a run on the bank, which was made more likely by the stupidity of the banking system's structure) and, some 20 years after the Fed, the creation of the FDIC.": 5, 'You are applying his theory to one of the most heavily regulated, monopolized, and subsidized industries in the world.

They modified [the 1956 Bank Holding Company Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_Holding_Company_Act) to allow banks to own banks in other states.\n\nBanks had previously been restricted to having branches only in one state. Throughout the 80s, as ATM technology expanded, banks successfully argued in court that ATMs didn't constitute a branch, so they started putting ATMs everywhere, effectively operating in multiple states without being allowed to have branches there. Over time, banks effectively became inter-state operators, so the law was changed to realize this new reality.\n\nI can speak more about why banks were restricted to operating in one state, but the answer is long and has to do with US banking history, a history of populist politics, and the debate over central banking in the US that goes back to the nation's founding.\n\nAnyway, the short version of your question is that the restriction in interstate banking went away, so they consolidated. Before the law change, if you're a california bank like say BofA used to be, you can't buy or operate a bank in Nevada. Law changes, so now you can. So the richest banks started buying smaller regional operators.

For example, words prohibited by the state of Louisiana include bank, banker, banking, savings, safe deposit, trust, trustee, and credit union.\n\nSo looking at the names on the left you\'ll see there are plenty of non-bank entities, e.g., Summit Bancorp, UJB Financials, Bear Sterns, and so on. These are investment companies, not commercial bankers where they accept deposits from Joe Schmoe.\n\nAnd, yes, the repeal of Glass-Stegall is what permitted commercial banks and investment banks to operate under the same umbrella and for these investment arms to use commercial bank deposits to underwrite their investing. Without Glass-Stegall a number of these mergers wouldn\'t have been permissible or made any economic sense.

We look forward to reviewing Bitcoin Core\xe2\x80\x99s updated roadmap and evaluating it on its technical merits, but we do not believe that this should be done to the exclusion of other development efforts.\n> \n> Like those who signed the Call for Consensus document, we share the common goal of seeing bitcoin succeed. The bitcoin network has proven resilient in the face of many challenges over the years, and we do not believe that testing different implementations of the software poses a threat to the network.

Something like 5% of nodes can relay blocks at an orphan rate of .05%. At 1 Freaking MB. Making blocks bigger before we implement space optimization through SegWit, and improvements like IBLT to block relays, WILL DAMAGE THE NETWORK. It could potentially double the bandwidth demands of nodes online, and I again point to the figure of reliable nodes as far as miners are concerned. They currently rely on a CENTRALIZED mesh of nodes to counteract that. At 1 MB. \n\nCore IS NOT REFUSING A HARDFORK INCREASE. They are not going to do it NOW, because thats a stupid move. You add costs to nodes that CAN be fixed first, so that with a hardfork blocksize increase it does less damage to the network in terms of making nodes cost more to run in terms of resources. \n\nClassic's plan is like taking a cross country road trip when they need new transmission fluid, BEFORE changing the transmission fluid. Its fucking batshit. ": 1, 'Do you have any links articles, threads, whatever about this Blockstream company and their relationship with Bitcoin? This sounds like a real disaster. \n\nBitcoin can\'t share the blockchain with any other project. It\'s already 50+GB to download. Piggybacking another currency on it would be ridiculous.  How big is it now?  Having more than one type of currency on it would make it even bigger, and useless for the ones not interested in the other currency.\n\nIf the dev team bow down to corporate pressures, such dangerous things like "sidechains", "colored coins" and such other attempts to turn it into fiat, then bitcoin will cease to be useful in the ways it is now.\n\nThen I\'d be switching over to an altcoin.  If that is ClassicCoin, or another, well we\'ll see.  I don\'t like ClassicCoin\'s style though, and don\'t trust their motivations. Too heavy handed.\n\nAt this point what really needs to be done is to put huge pressure on the bitcoin devs to abandon all ideas like "sidechains" and anything that can be easily controlled by current financial giants.': 1, '> They are simply trying to completely take over years of work behind the bitcoin name\n\nIn this regard, we definitely disagree.  This is open source software.  Anyone is allowed to fork a repo on github.  This isn\'t "taking over years of work".  Anyone who has worked on the code will always have credit.  Go look at the repo for bitcoin classic, it still lists all the developers who work on core.  No one is stealing anything or claiming credit for anything they didn\'t do.\n\n> They won\'t succeed\n\nI agree that they likely won\'t initiate a fork.  To get the miners on board, you need the whole ecosystem on board.  Miners won\'t switch without exchanges switching.  Exchanges won\'t switch without users, and users won\'t switch without merchants.\n\nBut "succeed" is subjective.  Perhaps the goal is just to get Core to include a future hard fork for a max blocksize increase.  In that regard, they might succeed.  Only time will tell.\n\n> Bitcoin is doing just fine.\n\nAs of today, again I agree.  But we are near capacity, and some fear that future adoption may stall without larger capacity increases.\n\n> What is the Bitcoin team doing so wrong?\n\nI think some believe that the Blockstream corporation, who pays many big name Core developers, has a conflict of interest.  Some think the products they offer benefit from bitcoin being near capacity, since they offer off-chain solutions.\n\nI have argued that Blockstream needs bitcoin to be strong to be profitable.  But there has been times where I have also questioned Blockstream\'s motives.  As of right now, I want Core\'s scaling roadmap, and I have no reason not to trust Core.  However I do believe that a future max blocksize increase will eventually be necessary.  1MB is arbitrary and too small.  It was never meant to be a long term limit.\n\n*edit: grammar, spelling*': 3, 'If a tiny dev team, (huge corporate backing or no) of a separate altcoin project (ClassicCoin and Bitcoin are incompatable) takes over the Bitcoin infrastructure (blockchain), then bitcoin ceases to exist.\n\nThere is no way realistic threat of this happening.

Of course I'll see a pattern if you're writing in that fashion. Classic will address those real problems as well, as any developer would do in that situation, but first things first. Block size. I doubt the skilled developers in either side are completely ignoring any of the scaling problems you mention, but you can't deny that raising to 2MB is at least a step in the right direction, and that the Core developers have resorted to very dirty tactics, from censorship to legal counsel which would threaten the entire cryptocurrency landscape were it not lies. All I'm taking away from this is that Core is activity preventing one simple way to increase transaction capacity.\n\nTell me though, why would raising the block size cripple the network? Most aclassic supporters are also pro SegWit and Lightning Network. Hell, we're largely pro *anything* that'll improve Bitcoin's capacity to scale. 2MB is one of those things. And Core doesn't seem to want to go there, for no good reason, aside from their conflicting interest in creating private settlement layers.

Surely we should be more pragmatic in these circumstances and lower the threshold?\n\nFortunately, we\'re in a reasonably good position insofar as there are no obviously dominant miners or pools (I\'m thinking back to when GHash consistently maintained >40% hashrate) -- so the "magic number" (i.e. to prevent one miner/pool veto risk) need not be too low. Sure, I\'d rather mining be more decentralised, and the "magic number" be 90-95%, but it\'s not, so it can\'t be. 75% is reasonable.

The claim was made that no, it\'s not theft because if you possess a bitcoin, it means that you own it.

Maybe I have a video recording of you running away with my paper wallet, laughing manically?\n\nOk, but inherently one can\'t prove that they own a ten dollar bill, and reasonably that can be extended to Bitcoin due to the pseudonymous nature of it. For example, how would one prove whether they intended a transaction in bitcoin as opposed to someone \'taking\' bitcoin from their wallet? I think reasonably, it would be just as difficult as trying to trace a cash transaction. \n\n>Logically, if it\'s legal to take someone\'s bitcoins, then it should be legal to take someones 10\xe2\x82\xac bills, because proving ownership of those, without possession, is just as difficult as with bitcoin.\n\nDealing with the OP\'s scenario I think there isn\'t really a legal issue here and this is why. Let\'s say I went to the library and left a $10 bill on the counter and left. It wouldn\'t be reasonable for me to assume it will still be there the next day when I come back to the library. Leaving his qbr code on the library PC is somewhat like this. \n\nSo I think the disconnect between our points of view is the \'wallet\' aspect of bitcoin. A bitcoin wallet really isn\'t like a physical wallet. If I left my wallet on the library counter the money inside has an identifiable owner. If I just left a wad of cash there, there\'s no identifiable owner. In this way, a bitcoin wallet is a lot more like a rubber band around a wad of bills as there\'s no true identifier tying a wallet to a person.\n\n\n': 1, "The way I look at this, it's a LE judgement call, and they'd probably say this is stealing, but only because it involves a computer. If you had dropped some cash from your pocket in the library and someone else picked it up, it wouldn't be seen as theft. Since you effectively did the same thing I don't see it as theft, but since a computer is involved, it would likely be characterized as such. ": 1, ">Bitcoin is a technology.

Just because I have the bill in my possession does not mean that I actually own the 10\xe2\x82\xac it represents.\n\nI'm not sure this is a strong analogy simply because the bill isn't just the representation of the value, it is the value. If I burn a $10 bill, it's gone. If I lose the access keys, the bitcoin still exists, it's just unusable until I find the access keys again. The rest of the point isn't unsolid.

NOD32 is the best chance you have.  \nBetter, always check about 5 characters in the end of the BTC address you are pasting. Do not check the start of the address, because most people checks it and the software is written to target most people.  \nAlso the software is not able to nail more than 3-4 characters, or it would take too long.
