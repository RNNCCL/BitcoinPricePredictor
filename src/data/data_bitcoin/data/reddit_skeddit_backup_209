However this leads to a change in the implied FRC/USD rate from these markets, leading to an arbitrage opportunity between these two markets and FRC/USD, thus the selling pressure migrates to the FRC/USD market, reducing the value of FRC relative to USD. As such the central bank can defend the attack by using their USD reserves, or in fact any foreign reserves, or gold etc. \n\nI'm sure it makes sense for central banks to hold their reserves in a broad set of currencies, but I don't see how bitcoin is completely necessary in this framework.": 21, "They already tried, it didn't work, so now they are going to join the system.

The IMF would not need to touch BTC, as its exchange rate with the TUV has no impact on that country\'s economy.\n\nJust to add though this is a completely theoretical exercise as an attacker on TUV has nothing to gain from doing this.  The economic reason why you would attack a currency is if a country is trying to maintain a peg, and an attack is a way to force a devaluation, which would make your short of that currency profitable.  In a floating currency market youre just moving rates that might have economic implications, but no clear exit.  You sell TUV/BTC forever, but at some point you have to cover your short and buy back the TUV/BTC, unlike in a peg scenario, there is no guarantee you wont get squeezed trying to exit (aka everyone in the world knows you have to buy back a ton of TUV, you think they\'re gonna sell it to you cheap?), thus making the attack highly risky and mostly pointless.': 0, "This is a weird article that bunches together random quotes, and titles it in a way that suggests a btc based speculative attack is imminent or at least a possibility.

Does that matter to anyone at all outside of BTC speculators?  The answer is no, it doesn't matter at all.  A speculative attack only matters if it affects relevant cross currencies.  When George Soros attacked the GBP, he drove its price down relative to the USD, Deutsche Mark, etc.  Currencies that are relevant because the UK imports goods that are denominated in those currencies.  This causes pressure on the UK economy, and as a result the central bank had to act.  \n\nA speculative attack on USD via BTC would drive up BTC/EUR, BTC/GBP etc, but is very unlikely to have a material impact on the relevant crosses such as EUR/USD, GBP/USD etc.\n\nFactor in that it would take selling of hundreds, maybe thousands of times the entire market cap of BTC to make the slightest dent in USD, you realize how dumb all of this is.": 9, 'Looking more and more prophetic\n\n>  July 4, 2014 ': 12, "This is a non-issue, just ask the guys over at the big 5 banks or the FED: You naked short sell and then don't deliver the underlying asset but settle in cash. \n\nIt's entirely possible to control the price of Bitcoin with just USD without previously having aquired Bitcoin.

Presumably that is only for the microcontroller ?\n\nThe main advantage is to be able to debug the running code directly on the target. Also to flash whatever you want and always be able to recover (provided that code didn\'t disable JTAG). Native JTAG will only be for the microcontroller, the secure element might expose some kind of "soft JTAG" if we manage to do it.\n\n> Trustless : Is blue going to ship with read only microcontroller segments containing Ledger \'s bootloader and public keys, like Trezor ?\n\nThe non secure microcontroller will be fully open and reflashable with no bootloader\n\n> Or will there be no read only segments, allowing the user to write a custom microcontroller bootloader/firmware with their own public keys ?\n\nThis. Blue security model will be slightly exotic as you can guess :)\n\n>  I have wondered about Trezor/keepkey shipping a blank device, but that might open the evil maid attack.\n\nThey could still do it for developers unit if users specifically ask for it, even if it might be a burden on the production line. If I were doing it, I\'d keep a few 100s units on the side for that though.\n\n> When developing secure apps - will that be like running fidesmo signed apps on Unplugged ?\n\nApps will be first developed in C and then (probably later) support a Fidesmo-like VM.\n\n> Are there going to be 2 tiers of Ledger Blue, and if so what will be the differences ?\n\nNo, but there is another Blue-like device that\'s still to be unveiled. This Blue (the one we\'re currently talking about) is our true vision though.\n\n> If sensitive storage and signing is all done on the secure element, how does the ST31 benchmark in comparison to Nano and Ledger HSM ?\n\nIt\'s way faster than the Nano (I clocked a BLE exchange + signature in around 30 ms), and way slower than a HSM (which doesn\'t really matter since the main task of the HSM is to perform a large number of unrelated signing operations per second)\n\n> When entering sensitive data into Blue, like a mnemonic or private key, will Blue switch into a TEE OS on the secure element ?\n\nNo, but you\'ll be able to prove that it was done the way it was supposed to be done. I\'ll let you think about that :)\n\n> Will all secure element signing prevent Pass Phrase support ?\n\nWe might be able to run PBKDF with more reasonable timings on that one. Didn\'t benchmark it yet though.\n\n>  BIP38 Recovery on device ? SSSS ?\n\nNo, but there\'ll be more than enough space on the Secure Element for a third party application to support it\n\n> Can/does Blue run javacard apps like Google Authenticator TOTP ?\n\nIt will not support Java Card, only native applications first, then a close relative of Java Card, still not binary or source compatible with it (mostly for licensing reasons)\n\n> I take it Blue shouldn\'t be used to sign transactions containing hundreds of inputs\n\nThat wouldn\'t be recommended.
