Have you ever seen anything more powerful than this image?', 3798): {'Hong Kong Protesters are using mesh-net on a widescale right now. Meshnets grow stronger with more users. The Old-School Traditional Internet is connected at the core through "BackBones" which are owned and operated by corporate, government, military interests. These backbones are centralized points of failure that can be exploited or manipulated. In addition, the cables and frequencies that the internet is transmitted over are owned by corporate/government interests, taking another point of control away from the people.\n\nThe Meshnet is a concept embodied by many technologies and services. The main idea is to use overlapping WiFi signals on cellphones, routers, laptops, etc to create a new Internet that cannot be censored or controlled. You may be saying to yourself "But there will be many connectivity gaps and at some point the meshnet will need to connect to the traditional Internet" This is where Bitcoin and the Cryptographic revolution come in.\n\nSome Protocols for the Meshnet are now maturing, things like BitCloud, and MaidSafe. \n\nThese Protocols incentivize people to provide bandwidth, storage, and servers to the meshnet. The protocols use cryptographic techniques that allow people to a) Prove that they something of value, harddrive space for instance, and b) Receive payment for providing the service.\n\nThe data on the meshnet is orders of magnitude more secure, both in privacy and in reliability. Data is encrypted and broken in millions or billions of bits and those bits are copied and spread throughout the meshnet like grains of sand. No one place stores a full copy of your data, yet many, many copies of your data exist.\n\nThe more traffic your facilitate on your network, the more Bitcoins (or "local" crypto) you are paid. The more space your provide for storage, the more cloud computing power, the more you are paid.\n\nJust like Bitcoin mining, we will see an arms race to provide network connectivity, storage space, computing power, at cheaper and cheaper prices. The charts below are the amount of computing power invested into the Bitcoin network in the:\n\n1) Past Year https://blockchain.info/charts/hash-rate\n2) Past 2 Years https://blockchain.info/charts/hash-rate?timespan=2year&showDataPoints=false&daysAverageString=1&show_header=true&scale=0&address=\n\n3) Past 5 Years  https://blockchain.info/charts/hash-rate?timespan=all&showDataPoints=false&daysAverageString=1&show_header=true&scale=0&address=\n\nThis is the kind of accelerated growth we will see when the Meshnet is given the proper incentives.\n\nThis is a real chance for meaningful revolution without any kind of war. I say it is a revolution because it overturns the control of information and financial systems.\n\nIt also empowers individuals to be paid by a non-human entity. You work for the protocol and the protocol rewards everyone fairly without taking a cut for itself. Yes, its still funded by humans paying into the system, but its a different kind of control system.\n\nInformation, Coinage, Employment. These systems are ripe for inversion. The traditional systems will simply become less relevant and the new systems more profitable, more relevant. It will be analogous to the industrial revolution. Agricultural and traditional jobs simply became less relevant compared to industrial jobs.\n\nYou might think to yourself "The powers that be wont take this sitting down" and I say to that; they are certainly running out of time to do anything about stopping it. The nature of these programs is that there is no single point of failure. In order to stop it they must stop everyone who is using these programs. And as they stop people, it becomes more and more profitable for those who keep running, just further incentivizing it. These programs are all open-source, which allows anyone to review the code at anytime. This results in secure code devoid of "backdoors."\n\nAt this point there are only 3 options I envision that will keep the Cryptographic revolution from occurring.\n\n1) Solar Flare/Gamma Ray Burst/International Pandemic (Rare Life Ending Events; Non human based)\n2) Outright War on Cryptography which ends in full Dark Age; Possible WW3\n3) Quantum Computers developed in the future are able to decrypt classical encryption. However Quantum Computers would also be able to create unbreakable encryption, which could lead the way to a new Cryptographic revolution.\n\nI see #3 as the most probable of these scenarios, but practical Quantum Computing is still decades out and even then we may be able to anticipate developments in Quantum Cryptography that allow a transition to the new system before opportunists. It would seem that if the first Cryptographic revolution is successful then Quantum Computers would be developed for the express purpose of aiding the Protocol rather than destroying it.\n\n\nThe Hong Kong Protests may be the ignition to set the revolution off. Meshnets need users, the more users, the stronger and faster they are. Once meshnets break a certain thresh-hold they will be an attractive Internet option.\n\nInstead of paying an ISP, you will load Bitcoin into your Meshnet router. Each packet of data will have a tiny fraction of Bitcoin attached to it. You can offset your internet costs by making some harddrive space available or allowing your router to be used as a node to facilitate other peoples traffic.
