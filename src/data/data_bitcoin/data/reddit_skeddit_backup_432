What FHC privatized were loss-making, terribly inefficient companies. This was nothing new: this modernizing project had started under Collor, who in this aspect was a pretty decent president (unlike others who followed). Want proof? Just ask any older relative and they can confirm phone lines were listed as assets in your tax returns and they were willed before 1997. I clearly remember seeing Telebr\xc3\xa1s landlines being worth 2-5 THOUSAND reais.

The only time someone sells something for a significant amount below its market value is when the transaction is made in a hurry. The privatization of Vale, Telebr\xc3\xa1s and other companies (who are now state-controlled again, by the way - Dilma controls Vale through pension funds, which spells doom for the future prospects of the company) was widely publicized, debated for YEARS, and happened at open auctions.\n\n> borrow money from the IMF and other sources like crazy, at insane interets rates\n\nYou\'re clearly an ideologue, so you probably have never bothered checking your facts. The actual fact is that the IMF exists to provide countries with money at interest rates BELOW those of the open market - if it didn\'t, why in the hell would countries borrow from it? What it demands in exchange is something so obvious it takes someone as delusional as a Latin American leftist to deny it: that governments don\'t spend money they don\'t have.\n\nAnd boy does Brazil do that. The causes of our lousy public finances are multiple, and usually widely defended by the left:\n\n- *Pharaoh-esque*, questionable state works like the S\xc3\xa3o Francisco river diversion (which has been dearly paid for, even if it doesn\'t exist);\n\n- huge hydro power plants like Belo Monte, Itaipu, and Balbina;\n\n- bread-and-circus soccer stadiums like those built in the 70s and renovated for the World Cup, and which are now rotting as "white elephants";\n\n- but also tuition-free colleges "for all";\n\n- the single-payer healthcare system;\n\n- workers\' "rights" which throw a wrench into the labor market (if there\'s any foreigner who\'s made it this far into this rant - did you know there\'s a whole separate branch of the judicial system meant only to punish employers and reward employees? And that the law that system is based on was imported essentially word-for-word from 1930s Fascist Italy?)\n\n- batshit insanely unsustainable social security;\n\n- corporate welfare;\n\n- aid to leftist dictatorships abroad like Venezuela, where people are better off wiping their butts with banknotes than toilet paper, because what little TP there is has been rendered more expensive than the value of the banknotes by the leftist dictators\' policies;\n\n- man, the list goes on and on and on.\n\nBasically, you are sooooooo wrong that the only thing you put the blame for the debt on - privatizations - is actually something that helped *alleviate* the debt. Never forget that Lula clearly stated his economic model was inspired by that of Geisel - as demonstrated by him doing the exact same things the general did.\n\n> And yet the 1:1 peg came loose a few days after Cardoso was reelected\n\nFalse. Our elections are in October. The peg collapsed the next January. Because of the Russian crisis. Our policies weren\'t perfect back then, far from it. But devaluing the real helped us weather FHC\'s second term. How well are we doing in the current international crisis? Well, **the crisis is f\'\'king over**, everyone in the world is growing by 2-3% (7% in the case of China). Yet Brazil stagnates. Because of people like YOU.

People would calculate in USD and just use the correct amount of whatever the local currency of the day was (there were seven of them between 1986 and 1994).\n\nAlso, the people I interacted with were generally aware of the peg between the URV and the USD. The broader population might not explicitly know, but the information wasn't kept a secret either: people had to know how many cruzeiros an URV was, and also the dollar exchange rate was generally available, so people could do the math and see the URV closely tracked the USD.": 1, "Ok, but a loaf of bread, when priced in usd, may be like $.09 in india.

By effectively pegging their currency to the usd, they open themselves up to greater influence by foreign economies. When shocks to foreign markets happened a couple years down the road, it dragged Brazil down because Brazil couldn't untangle themselves through either monetary policy or exchange rate adjustments.\n\n This is literally the textbook reason why it's dangerous to have a fixed exchange rate with a different country. Bitcoin would have served the exact same purpose and lead to the same result. All the issues and mechanism that lead up to the collapse caused by Brazilian economy not being able to adjust due to its currency being fixed would happen if a universal currency like btc is being used. Something like btc would de facto force all users to peg currency used in their economy all other economies using the same currency. Replicating the exact same scenario.

Let's say there was a harder lower boundary on the dollar value of the real in the first 6-12 months of the currency introduction. Then, until early 1999, the nominal exchange rate was allowed to fluctuate in such a way as to keep the price-adjusted rate fairly constant. That is, this was a crawling peg.\n\nBefore the changeover, during the URV period, the peg was a lot stricter.": 3, "No, it shouldn't.  A loaf of bread is the same in Australia and Argentina, but the Australian Dollar fluctuates independently of the Argentine peso, so day to day the exchange between the two will be different.  To go from Argentine Pesos -> bitcoin -> Australian dollars would be a different rate from day to day.  \n\nThat's why a good will always be represented in local currency, and bitcoin will have a floating exchange rate against said local currency.": 2, 'Interesting both from a financial and human psychology perspective.': 7, "Brazilian here.

With their custom SecureRandom, this is safe because it mixes the entropy using XOR, so even if the random.org data is dodgy it won't reduce security. It's just an added bonus.\n\nBUT! On some devices under some circumstances, the LinuxSecureRandom class doesn't get registered. This is likely because /dev/urandom doesn't exist or can't be accessed for some reason.

The upper case letters are distinguished from the lower case letters. 97 is "a", 98 is "b", 122 is "z".\n\nThe digits "0" through "9" are in the ascii encoding, too.

The simplest method is to start with a nonce of zero and increment by one.\n\nIf a miner runs out of nonces for a given block (there are 4,294,967,296 possible nonces) they can change the timestamp or transactions, which will give a whole new batch of hashes, and start trying nonces again.": 1, "Thanks - this makes perfect sense.\n\nThe only one thing I'm unclear about is that I thought the nonce was a number.

Basically the gist of it is that every week, your total daily posts, likes (soon to be replaced by upvote/downvotes) and other site activity etc. are tallied up and turned into a final score. Any posts which get removed as spam or w/e by a moderator give you negative points on your final score. Once a week, an amount of LTBCOIN tokens (on a fixed schedule) gets created and then automatically distributed to members based on their participation scores.  For example, if there were 10 members participating in total, and each got the same participation score of 1,000 points, then each would get 10% of the new tokens issued. \n\nIt\'s been an interesting gimmick, but has had it\'s own challenges as well. For instance, at the beginning, it was pretty easy to game the system, so we saw a huge amount of russian and indonesian users (not sure why those 2 groups were so prominent) doing things like making constant 1 or 2 word nonsense posts, farming likes/upvotes among eachother, and also making tons of duplicate accounts for coin farming purposes. We have since introduced various anti-spam measures and have adapted how the reward score calculation works, which has brought the issues down to a pretty decent level, but it can still be tweaked and improved. The trick is figuring out how to keep the reward percentages always in favour of the most valuable and legitimately active users.\n\nA similar set up but using purely BTC would be pretty cool, but the main problem with that is figuring out where that bitcoin is going to come from, need some sort of pool of community funds or way to monetize the site in order to keep payouts flowing, and that would also need to increase with the growth of the forum in general.. people might not have as much of an incentive to participate  if they see the amount of BTC they are getting constantly going down. With the LTBCOIN token, we can create as much of it as we want for basically free... but then it only has any sort of value if the community/network has value, which can be a good or a bad thing depending on how you look at it.

Nash played a role somewhere between a \xe2\x80\x9csteerer\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 insofar as he helped users navigate their way to finding drugs on Silk Road \xe2\x80\x93 and a lookout \xe2\x80\x93 insofar as he kept the boss (Ulbricht) apprised of things he should know. But Nash was not directly involved in facilitating or mediating specific drug transactions, as were the site administrators. Also unlike the site administrators, Nash did not have administrative access to users\xe2\x80\x99 accounts on the Silk Road marketplace, which users needed to buy or sell drugs through Silk Road. (Users\xe2\x80\x99 accounts on the Silk Road discussion forum were separate). Thus, while Nash\xe2\x80\x99s role on Silk Road was not unimportant, its connection to the actual drug trafficking taking place on the site was significantly attenuated, compared to the conduct of his co-conspirators.\n\n> There are other mitigating factors to consider in sentencing Nash. Most significantly, Nash\xe2\x80\x99s criminal conduct in this case appears to be an aberration. Aside from periods of personal drug use, there is no indication that Nash has previously been involved in drug trafficking or that he is likely to return to such criminal activity in the future. To the contrary, Nash\xe2\x80\x99s lengthy and impressive employment history shows that he has spent most of his working life contributing generously to society, as a social worker focused on helping populations with physical and intellectual disabilities. Moreover, Nash\xe2\x80\x99s successful completion of a drug abuse treatment program and multiple other rehabilitative courses during his imprisonment in this case evidences a commitment to avoiding future drug use and rebuilding a productive life upon release. It also appears that Nash has a well-developed support network to help him achieve these goals.': 6, "Several of the early mods and admins did so.

Most people, including myself, are quite comfortable storing small amounts of bitcoin on on their cellphone wallet.  I recommend using Mycelium.\n\n>>Where should I buy my bitcoins from? I only want to play around with them and see how it works/get some experience to start off. I just got $20 in the mail for my birthday and I want to use that for the coins. \n\nThe best way, if it is an option, is to attend a 'bitcoin meetup' group in your area.  This will accomplish two things.  First, someone will be happy to sell you $20 worth of bitcoin in person and, second, they will be able to answer all your questions that you might have about the topic.\n\nIf there is no bitcoin meetup in your area, you have several options.  One is to see if anyone near you is selling bitcoins via the Mycelium app you installed on your android cell phone.  Or you can sign up for an account with Circle or Coinbase.  You can also try localbitcoins.com\n\n>>Do people take cash for bitcoins? \n\nYes, all the time.\n\n>>If so were, and would they do it even though its such a small amount?\n\nLike I said, a bitcoin meetup group is your best bet.  Just try to find anyone you know IRL that has bitcoin.\n\n>>Is bitcoin's price something that changes a lot? like if I was to get $20 today is it possible it would only be worth $10 towmorrow?\n\nIt has been a lot less volatile lately.  More likely it will be worth $19 one day and $21 the next.\n\n>>Are wallets insured like banks? \n\nNo, bitcoin behaves like cash.  This is on purpose.  \n\n>>If someone steals my coins will the wallet company take the heat or will i?\n\nThere is no such thing as a 'wallet company'.  Bitcoins are protected by a password.  I really huge ass password.  All a 'wallet' does is manage your password.  \n\nBitcoins are stored on a global ledger called the blockchain.  To access them (to send and receive transactions) you use a piece of software called a 'wallet' which just handles submitting and receiving the transactions and manages your bitcoin password (known as a private key).": 11, 'LOL, circle are good at giving away VC moolah, they have plenty of it to loss lead w/.
