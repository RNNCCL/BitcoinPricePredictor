Believe it or not, that makes a huge different in the legal world. At the end of the day, this is just one of the ways that OKCoin is using to invalidate the original contract.\n2. This is also what always amazed me when working with Chinese companies. No matter how large the company, they *always* seem to have issues with hiring people that can actually read and write English properly. That\'s also why you see those humorous pics of large stores in China that have very obvious errors in their English advertisements. For some reason, Chinese companies never want to hire native English speakers, even with important matters.': -4, "I completely disagree that the contract was one sided in any way.  I've had other offers in writing with a guaranteed minimum payment MUCH higher than OKcoin contract but with less upside on the top end.  Bitcoin.com is the #1 domain name in an industry that is on the way to becoming one of the most important ecosystems in the world.": 13, '"Cultural context" justifications like these are pure bigotry of low expectations. I have China experience as well (don\'t worry, China "experts" are a dime a dozen these days) and I am also familiar with the business practices of Chinese companies. Yes, they all do this. They don\'t do it because it\'s part of Chinese culture and sanctioned in Confucius\'s Analects, they do it because it is convenient. Never do these "cultural differences" damage the Chinese party, it\'s always the Westerner who gets shortchanged. Chinese business culture mimics sociopathy very closely through extensive use of deception, blackmail, honeypot traps, impersonation, fatiguing the opponent, judicial and political corruption and all the rest of the crook\'s toolbox (anyone interested can check out the "Thirty-Six Stratagems" to see examples of this kind of Machiavellic sociopathy in writing - it\'s a very basic business reading in China).\n\nThere is no cultural misunderstanding here. OkCoin understands perfectly what Ver is saying, what he wants and why he think it\'s owed to him. They just also think they can get away with not giving it to him.': 58, '10k a month is very reasonable.    BTC.com sold to GAW for 1.1m..  Okcoin is getting a better ranking site for half the cost and no large upfront investment.    It is, by all means, an exceptional price.': 6, "Hey Roger, thanks for personally replying. Like I said, I don't find the fault with you specifically, but rather on both sides equally albeit for different reasons. That being said...\n\nI don't think the contract is one-sided because of the price being paid. In fact, I think the $10k/month is of minimal concern to OKCoin. From what I'm reading, the main issue at hand is that OKCoin can put an entire team on this project, and invest a lot of resources, only to have the constant risk of you pulling the plug at any time. In other words, you have all the power, and they have none. This is what seems one-sided to me about the contract. \n\nIn addition, it seems like they can't pull out of the project even if they wanted to, because the only party capable of terminating the agreement is you, and with just a 30 day notice. \n\nSo it seems that they're expected to pay a lot of money every month, in addition to paying for the team and resources expended to actually build out the domain, with the constant risk of losing everything if you give 30-day notice for *any* reason. Conversely, if the project doesn't go as expected for them and they're not getting the returns they thought they would, they don't have the same privilege as you have to end the contract.\n\nOf course, I haven't seen the contract and I'm only going by the content of the emails. But if this info is correct, then I hope you can see why this is a one-sided contract.": 13, "I actually didn't see your previous post in the other thread.\n\nAs for my identity, it's absurd. Look at my posting history. I've been on reddit for years and prior to today I never mentioned OKCoin in any of my other posts or even got involved in OKCoin-related threads. \n\nIn regards to who is at fault and whether or not OKCoin can pay the $10k/month is not the core of the issue and I personally don't believe that it is the reason that OKCoin is taking up issue with the contract. They're taking up issue because it is a contract which is inherently unfair to them (for the reasons I state above), and it is one which was signed by someone else in the company who is no longer there. Imagine if you're the CEO of a company and you know that you have a team that is working on a project, but when you actually look into it further a few months later, you discover that the team is burning through cash and is destined for failure. As CEO, it's your job to step in and correct the situation. From the email conversation, it sounds like Star knew about the domain, but probably didn't know the terms of the agreement that CZ made. Now, he's finding out that the terms are entirely untenable from OKCoin's side, and he's trying to fix the problem by renegotiating the contract. That's how I'm interpreting it.": 2, "It is Ver's fault for creating a one-sided contract that only benefited him and then getting surprised that the other party would come to their senses.": -5, 'As for your number 1, this is NOT correct. They acknowledge the validity of the contract through course of dealings... they paid Ver and took control of the domain. The entire "the correct legal entity is not listed" defense would never fly in a western court strictly based on the facts of the case acknowledged by both parties.': 1, "2 is not a valid excuse. Relying on Google Translate and not having someone who reads/writes english for a legal document worth hundreds of thousands of dollars is one of the dumbest things I've ever heard.  If they truly did this, then it sounds like they weren't concerned about the total value of the contract which means they should just pay the amount they're asking which is much cheaper for okcoin.  If they could truly afford it without worrying, they would have paid it off without making a big stink.": 5, 'To be perfectly fair, the allegations of forgery are as yet unproven.': 0}, ('Trading in New Zealand Dollars on Independent Reserve', 25): {'Awesome!

Let's assume Alice's expenses are 1BTC, so at the end of the week she would have 2BTC, or 400USD.\n\nIf Alice accepts BTC, she ends up with 2BTC profit. Let's say that suddenly Goldman Sachs buys a huge amount of bitcoin, and the price raises to 1000USD. Now Alice's 2BTC are worth 2000USD. Or, let's imagine a whale dumps bitcoin, and the price drops to 100USD. Now Alice's 2BTC are worth only 200USD. Alice knows the inflation rate of BTC (it is currently at 25BTC/block, the future rates are known, and the rewards go to miners). Nobody can arbitrarily create more BTC, the only way the price will change outside the built-in inflation is if people decide BTC is more or less valuable to hold (i.e. they buy or sell a large volume overall). This is all assuming no relevant fluctuation in the value of USD.\n\nIf instead, Alice took her 600USD, then minus the 200USD expenses she has 400USD profit. Now, her 400USD profit is subject to the same fluctuations as BTC against other currencies. So if, for example, people suddenly decide to sell lots of USD and buy EUR, she may find a trip to Europe more expensive, and vice versa. But there is another possibility: that the banks issuing USD issue a lot of debt (possibly the Federal Reserve to the US Government, as during QE). Now a lot of new USD are created, and in the hands of these initial debtors. They can spend the newly created USD at their initial value, thus transferring a portion of the USD denominated wealth to these new USD holders on the basis of their promise to repay.

They think the 'difficult math problems' are fundamentally needed to create bitcoins, when really they are just arbitrary and needed to artificially make work so that there is a proof of work and blocks are expensive to create. \n\nI've been thinking about how to try and explain the need for proof of work, as generally in society we try to optimise things to need less work, so bitcoin immediately fights against your intuition by creating arbitrary work.

How can you do this?\n\nLet the person you're explaining this to think about it for a while, I guess they'll have no solution? because i think this needs proof of work to be solved. Forget hashing etc, explain proof of work with a simple example:\n\nImagine as the radio DJ you have access to unlimited different soduku puzzles that each take 45 mins for a human to solve. You let each listener email you and get a soduku in response.

I\'ll start with the easiest, miners can put as many transactions as they like in a block up as far as the block size limit (currently 1 megabyte). They will have heard about recent transactions from other nodes on the network who share them, the transactions originally come from user wallets. Miners include them because it\'s good for bitcoin, and because they get to keep any fee attached to any transactions they include.\n\nHow transactions get created in a way that can be verified is more complex, and is missing from this chandler-chain example in this thread.\n\nUnderstanding it first involves understanding some magic you can do with cryptographic math. Anyone can create a public/private key pair, lets say for example you do and the public key is "abcd" and the private key is "1234". There is some maths you can do that will \'sign\' a message (think of it like the hash function used in the blocks)  providing a signature specific to the message and those keys. The magic here is that you could give me, the public key (abcd) the message and the signature and I can *know* that you signed it with the private key even though I don\'t know that the private key is \'1234\'. I know this is a lot to grasp, but bear with me.\n\nIf you combine this signed message concept with the blockchain concept, it means we can create a history of blocks made up of signed messages (the transactions). Messages can say that they intend to transfer balances of coins from one public key to another. We can know what the balance of any public key is by adding/subtracting all transactions in the block history related to it. And only the person who owns the private key for a public key.\n\nWe know that a secure, incorruptible history of transactions that allows the owners of balances to make new transactions can be used as a system for money - even if it\'s all digital, after all this is how most money nowadays exists in banks. So a blockchain can be used as a money system.\ncan sign messages transferring any of the balance at that key to another one.': 2, "Congrats, i checked it for ya and it's good! =)\nEDIT: Love how your solution is the number of comments with me verifying it haha": 2, 'mostly, but your solution hash starts with "30" it must be like "0x" where x is any digit.\nAlso block 7 has already been mined now.': 1, 'Ha ha, thanks!

': 1, 'Ok, so at the time of writing the chain is 10 blocks long. There was a single transaction in each block, saying who solved it. Here\'s the ordered transaction history of block solvers we get from the chandler-chain:\n\n\n\n\nBlock  | Solver\n------|------\n1|KoKansei \n2|shludvigsen\n3|veqtrus\n4|werwiewas\n5|lentil-soup\n6|odal_limbs\n7|snarklasers\n8|guosim\n9|ididntsaygoyet\n10|100acrewood\n\nSo what\'s the use of this ? Firstly we know and can prove the blocks were solved in this order - anyone can trace back through the previous hashes in each block and verify the solutions even  if they only had the blocks themselves and could not see the reddit comments or timestamps.\n\nIt\'s important to know some things about the hashes themselves. No matter what data or how much data you put in a block, the hash will always be the same length, it will be seemingly random and it cannot be predicted. The only way to find a solution for a block that gives a specific pattern of hash and wins the game is by trial and error - there are no shortcuts. Changing any character in a block will change the answer hash, making the solution invalid. \n\nThis has a couple of neat consequences: we can regulate the rate blocks are solved (regardless of how many people are trying) by making the necessary answer hash more specific. Block 2 only needed any hash starting with a 0 - easy  it was solved quickly. Block 10 needed one starting with two 0s - it took longer to find a solution. Here\'s a recent hash from a real bitcoin block, how much work do you think you need to do making random guesses to find this with 17 leading 0s:\n\n> 0000000000000000054528a0d64c4e3476e1685a12db24716c562a6d308ab1ff\n\nSecondly, it means that work is needed to make every block, and this means that if someone wanted to corrupt the chain - to change history - for example to say peter123 solved block 2 instead of shludvigsen they would need to find a new solution for that block AND every block after it as the "previous" value in each block would change making their current solutions invalid. \n\nIf everyone takes the longest chain as the correct record of history, and there is lots of work being done to mine that chain making it longer all the time, we end up with a secure incorruptible history of blocks.\n\nOne additional thing, at the time block 5 was mined, it was impossible to predict who would solve block 8 or what the hash would be. On something as large as the bitcoin blockchain with massive amounts of work needed to solve each block, deciding in advance to use the hash of a specific future block as a random number gives a provably fair random number. /r/millionairemakers is using this to pick their winners.\n\nchandler-chain demonstrates the idea of a block-chain and shows how hashing and mining works. It\'s obviously not a full crypto-currency though as it\'s missing other aspects such blocks being shared among distributed nodes, automated block creation and verification (we were doing it by hand) and it doesn\'t have it\'s own native token - I was tipping block rewards manually via changetip. The public/private key transaction mechanism is completely missing from chandler-chain. \n\n\n': 19, 'block4:\n\n    block 4: handsomechandler sent werwiewas $1\n    revious=02f0c39e4576776a9721d0bfd85d694780a116155b85a44d131d7a41b49636aa\n    solution=33\n\n    hash:0413ee7e764499e129a77e2d896c02bd5645726f852f26ee07a251375e17c6c5': 5, "hah awesome, chandler-chain being overpowered!
