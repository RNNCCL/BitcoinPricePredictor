Bitcoin is still incredibly tiny in the grand scheme of things.  It\'s got a total "market cap" that is less than 0.1% of gold\'s.  So Bitcoin is obviously much more volatile. It\'s obviously much riskier than gold in the short- and medium- term (and probably in the longer-term as well).  The upside though is well, additional upside.  Bitcoin\'s potential upside is much, much larger than gold\'s.  When gold is described as a "store of value," people generally mean that quite literally.  It\'s a way to more or less preserve (not necessarily grow) your purchasing power and avoid fiat inflation.  But there\'s not a huge amount of upside potential there.  Even if the goldbugs\' dreams were to come true and the fiat system were to collapse and gold were to remonetize and again become the global monetary standard... I imagine you\'d be looking at, at most, a 10x increase in gold\'s real purchasing power.  In contrast, if Bitcoin were to become the global monetary standard, we\'re talking about a return on the order of 10,000x!

It is quite obvious what Bitcoin users want Bitcoin for - to get rich. In case this is news to you, the price can\'t substantially rise with only the buyers involved in the system now, there are billions of people out there who need to adopt Bitcoin in order to see appreciation. Are you, personally, going to keep up this level of demand? Of course not, nor will anybody who has already invested a signficant portion of their money into Bitcoin. To keep demand constant you need fresh money and to get that money you need attractive use cases beyond what is already available to people - in short, you need to give people a reason to consider Bitcoin\'s scarcity a factor. \n\nYou\'re confusing the current price of Bitcoins with a supply and demand equation when the current price is more based on speculation and manipulation than actual worldwide demand.\n\nBitcoin users value each coin at $290, ask your neighbor what value he gives Bitcoin - it is likely $0. Ask your parents, likely the same. These are the people who\'s money you need in order to buy Bitcoins after the halving. If the halving indeed fails to cause appreciation many will abandon this investment since this event is expected to increase the value but it\'s a truly mindless expectation without being able to describe what significant use-cases will draw new buyers to Bitcoin\n\nPut it another way - how can you expect this appreciation to occur when the economy is comprised of people who already own Bitcoin?

I stated clearly, if demand stays the same\n\nAsk yourself - why do you demand Bitcoins today? now eliminate any answer that can be accomplshed already with fiat - what are you left with? Speculation. You demand Bitcoins today because you expect they will appreciate, particularly because of the halving. You and many others share this reason of demand. \n\nNow, when the time comes and the halving doesn\'t do anything, you\'ve just lost a significant source of demand. People aren\'t buying Bitcoins as an inconvenient way to shop at Amazon or to pay rent, they are mostly buying it in hopes of getting rich. When this hope dissipates it\'s hard to imagine average consumers having any significant demand for Bitcoins considering it adds nothing to their lives.

It won\'t, because a reduced supply doesn\'t change the utility of Bitcoins, and so reducing the supply, even with consistent demand, will not necessarily result in appreciation. \n\nNot to mention most of the "demand" today is whales on no-fee chinese exchanges trading back and forth to create the illusion of actual order books.

This in itself is demand.\n\nI think this is actually the point that the parent comment was making. The idea is that you don\'t need "a huge bankroll" to keep your mined coins, you just need access to financing that pays your operational expenses. And so a miner that really, really wants to keep his/her coins should be able to find ways to prevent having to sell today through a secured loan or forward swap or something. And so the question isn\'t one of whether or not that demand exists, it\'s whether or not the quantity of coins supplied at the current spot price will be substantially lower after the reward changes.': 1, "I can make an educated guess and say tomorrow's volume will be the same as today's. \n\nThat is reasonable. \n\nYour doom and gloom crazy man rant is what requires evidence, my views are based on today (reality)": 1, 'No, I think bitcoiners believe demand for Bitcoin will be tomorrow what it is today.

People buy bitcoins in hopes of making money, when that doesn't occur as a result of the halving like you believe it will bitcoin sales will drop further as less people buy as an investment. \n\nTo put it another way the price is $290 today because there are enough people buying Bitcoins today knowing about the halving and potential future mania to sustain that level. If more people believed the halving was going to raise the price then the price would obviously be higher today. Since the price won't magically double the day of the halving, you have to presume that buyers would accumulate everything they can beforehand, but the same knowledge those buyers would have, they have today - that is to say the price before and after the halving will be roughly the same because the people who believe in the halving will have already bought in much earlier and the people who dont have no interest or need in bitcoin and a supply change is irrelevant to their demand ": -1, "You have evidence what tomorrow's volume will be ?!

Demand before the halving is obviously going to be higher than it will be after the halving when it has occurred and the price hasn't magically risen 2x on every exchange from, what, a sudden explosion of post-halving buying \n\nExplain to me - if the price is going to rise, when will it happen?

Maybe it's already started? We've gone from $200 to $290 pretty quickly. Some will sell now but I think we are just getting started. Where is future demand going to come from? 250 million people in Indonesia; 350 million people in USA; 1 billion people in India; 1 billion people in China ": 1, ">  That is the price now, with current supply/demand.\n\nBut I don't know if this offers enough explanatory power against the competing model that the current market rate represents the equilibrium price with a supply of 21 million. I guess it comes down to the questions of the strength of market efficiency and why somebody would presently sell coins for any price less than the equilibrium at that supply unless a. they don't know that the BTC reward schedule is more or less deterministic (which seems unlikely for anybody doing this in volume) or b. their business is operating at the margins and they can't finance it at a lower rate than whatever that shortfall represents to them. So for example if you have a mining farm and you think that the price will be higher after the reward changes, you should keep the coins you mine between now and then and borrow cash to finance operational expenses. But that affects the quantity supplied to your current buyers and should be reflected in a higher spot price today, which makes this marginally less profitable for others. And so all things being equal the only reason a well-informed rational miner *shouldn't* do this is if they can't finance operations cheaper than what it costs them to sell BTC today vs. post reward shift. If that credit market is efficient (which I sincerely doubt it is), it should put a strong bound on the magnitude of the price shift. As we weaken that efficiency assumption, we weaken that bound. But the point stands that if you're a miner (or anyone who needs to sell coins between now and the reward change) and you believe that the price will be significantly higher some time in the immediate future, you should be exhausting every financing route that's cheaper than the loss you sustain by selling your mined coins today.\n\ne: The corresponding (but simpler?) question for a well-informed rational buyer is: what's the highest interest rate at which you would borrow dollars today to buy 1 BTC at $290 if you have to sell it and pay back the loan on or immediately after the day that the reward changes?": 1}, ('If additional users drives up the price of Bitcoin, what will happen to price when user growth is constrained by the block size limit?', 0): {'I\'m not sure what you are saying, your words don\'t logically respond to mine.

It\'s a bit more than half treasuries, and a bit less than half "agency" mortgage securities (Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and Ginnie Mae)\n\n> The idea being is that the FED magic up money\n\nUnlike the banks they oversee, the Fed has no leverage limit.  If you divide total assets by capital, they are leveraged 77:1.  When they buy a treasury bond or MBS from a member bank, they just credit that bank\'s account with the Fed.  You will note the entry for "other deposits held by depository institutions" (i.e. banks) is more than half of total liabilities.  They have been doing a lot of crediting bank\'s accounts.\n\nThe magic part is the Fed carries the mortgage securities at face value, regardless of how crappy the underlying mortgages are.  This lets the banks off the hook, because their checking account at the Fed is always counted at full value.  If the Fed listed the MBS and treasuries at market value, they would probably have negative capital.\n\n> I confess that I don\'t fully understand how this lubricates an economy \n\nThe construction market (homes and commercial buildings) got overbuilt.  The collapse of that market, and all the secondary ones that depend on it (building materials, real estate agencies, the stores that construction worker\'s families shop at) caused 6% more of the workforce to become unemployed.  Buying up bad mortgages from the agencies that make MBSs kept them from going under.  Those agencies are necessary to support home finance.  It took several years for the oversupply of houses to get used up, but now people are building and buying again, and that part of the economy is working.\n\nLow interest rates encourages people and businesses to borrow.  Buying products increases demand, and expanding factories increases production to meet the demand.  More people go to work, everyone is happy, except banks, who make less from low rates.  At least that is the theory.': 2, 'A price increase in certain assets is not necessarily indicative of inflation.

The problem is that commodities, and the related price risks, are held in a variety of ways \xe2\x80\x93 long futures positions, over-the-counter investments, long term fixed-price purchasing contracts, physical inventory at the producer, etc. \xe2\x80\x93 making a complete accounting of capital dedicated to holding commodities from the time they are produced to the time they are consumed infeasible."*\n\nSo the reason for not applying the term "market cap" to commodities is not because they are not shares of a company, but for the reasons given above: It is simply not easily possible for a commodity to determine its total value (capitalization) on the markets, i.e. the "market capitalization", so the term is not easily applicable.\n\nIn contrast, Bitcoin units are fungible and denumerable like shares, and it is known exactly how many shares or bitcoins are in existence at any point in time. So there is a lot in common between company shares and bitcoins, in that in both cases the total value can be exactly quantified. So it seems all but far-fetched to talk about the "market cap" of Bitcoin (or bitcoins), and it is commonly used in this sense by many, if not most, people. Nobody is suggesting that Bitcoin is a company when using the expression "Bitcoin Market Cap".\n\nSo there is no point in pedantically insisting on the original meaning of "Market Cap" and claiming that Bitcoin has no market cap, except one wants to teach someone a lesson without deeper purpose.\n\nGenerally, in languages, meanings of terms evolve acc. to what is practical, and hence acc. to common usage of words and terms. The term "Market Cap" has evolved historically as a term only applicable to company shares because of the nature of assets. For currencies, the equivalent term is "money supply (e.g. M0)", for commodities like gold one simply talks about the "total value of", and crypto-currencies still are a new phenomenon with a short history.\n\nThe community has (intuitively or wittingly) grasped the above mentioned commonalities between company shares and bitcoins when it comes to expressing the total value, and hence has naturally applied the term "Market Cap" to bitcoins as well. Today we can read it everywhere, and nobody thinks that Bitcoin is a company because of that.\n\nWe can consider that as the EVOLUTION OF LANGUAGE. What you consider wrong today, is already common use today, and will be officially correct tomorrow.\n\nI dare to predict that soon we will read in text books and encyclopedias that the term "Market Cap" applies to company shares AND crypto-currencies with a defined money supply, whereas for the latter the term is used interchangeably with "money supply".\n\nHope I could teach you a little lesson back, we all learn from each other.': 1, "I did the calculation mark cap/coin and you're right!

Their\noperational accomplishments were truly extraordinary.\n\n> But their financial management was equally brilliant, particularly in recent years as the company\xe2\x80\x99s\nfinancial flexibility improved. Indeed, I can think of no major company that has had better financial management, a\nskill that has materially increased the gains enjoyed by IBM shareholders. The company has used debt wisely, made\nvalue-adding acquisitions almost exclusively for cash and aggressively repurchased its own stock.\n\n> Today, IBM has 1.16 billion shares outstanding, of which we own about 63.9 million or 5.5%.\nNaturally, what happens to the company\xe2\x80\x99s earnings over the next five years is of enormous importance to us.\nBeyond that, the company will likely spend $50 billion or so in those years to repurchase shares.

There would consequently be 910 million shares outstanding, and we\nwould own about 7% of the company. If the stock conversely sells for an average of $300 during the five-year\nperiod, IBM will acquire only 167 million shares. That would leave about 990 million shares outstanding after\nfive years, of which we would own 6.5%.\n\n>If IBM were to earn, say, $20 billion in the fifth year, our share of those earnings would be a full $100\nmillion greater under the \xe2\x80\x9cdisappointing\xe2\x80\x9d scenario of a lower stock price than they would have been at the higher\nprice.

You benefit when stocks swoon. Emotions, however, too often complicate the matter: Most people, including\nthose who will be net buyers in the future, take comfort in seeing stock prices advance. These shareholders resemble\na commuter who rejoices after the price of gas increases, simply because his tank contains a day\xe2\x80\x99s supply.\n\n> Charlie and I don\xe2\x80\x99t expect to win many of you over to our way of thinking \xe2\x80\x93 we\xe2\x80\x99ve observed enough\nhuman behavior to know the futility of that \xe2\x80\x93 but we do want you to be aware of our personal calculus. And here\na confession is in order: In my early days I, too, rejoiced when the market rose. Then I read Chapter Eight of Ben\nGraham\xe2\x80\x99s The Intelligent Investor, the chapter dealing with how investors should view fluctuations in stock\nprices. Immediately the scales fell from my eyes, and low prices became my friend. Picking up that book was one\nof the luckiest moments in my life.\n\n> In the end, the success of our IBM investment will be determined primarily by its future earnings. But\nan important secondary factor will be how many shares the company purchases with the substantial sums it is\nlikely to devote to this activity. And if repurchases ever reduce the IBM shares outstanding to 63.9 million, I will\nabandon my famed frugality and give Berkshire employees a paid holiday.': 1}, ('Here. We. Go.
