In addition, onerous rules makes wealth creation difficult. \n\nPrivate enterprise and natural resources have been able to create enough wealth to keep the economy going *despite* the vast amount of wealth that gets lost in government programs. ": 3, 'I thought Raymond Reddington gave them the Eldorado ': 1, "Thanks for the thoughtful and well argued reply.\n\nI used to agree with this reasoning, but I don't anymore. I do agree though, that from some viewpoints, this is less inefficient government spending than many other types of government spending. And if I was cutting in government spending it would not neccesarily be the first place I would cut. \n\nFirst of all, let's look at the cost to society, it would likely far more than the actual cost of the daycare itself. Think of the administration costs of the program and the costs of administrating the administrators.\n\nAlso, what is the true cost of daycare per day? I know that in Norway, childcare is regulated in such a way that there should be a maximum of 8 children per daycare worker...in practice though, one of the people might be sick or not able to be there the whole day. But let's take the regulations by their word...one person can take care of 8 children. What is the salary needed for a daycare worker? Let's use the median salary in Canada for 2013, which is CAD $32k per year (source: http://www.statcan.gc.ca/tables-tableaux/sum-som/l01/cst01/famil105a-eng.htm). And what could a woman expect to make from going to work? Let's say CAD $32k. In a completely free market, there would not be much administration cost or taxes, so the cost of day care would be CAD $20 per day (assuming 200 daycare days and 200 work days). \n\nI believe the government subsidized daycare costs more than that, due to administration costs outlined above instead of just having a person doing it, or cooperating with people in the neighbourhood for this. I mean think of the expense of renting daycare facilities isntead of using the empty houses while parents are at work. \n\nIt would be difficult for them to influence that as the government is paying for it and mandating everything through a complex bureaucracy. Then think of the costs associated with raising the taxes needed to subsidize child care and child care bureaucracy. Probably, the total bill for government subsidized daycare is several multiples of $13. Then think of if the government subsidized daycare does something parents don't like, and if that influences the child's development and creates a loss for that child later in life. \n\nOf course, part of this could be solved by using a voucher system where you just hand that money to parents and they can cash it in at daycare. Still, there are costs associated with raising taxes. So it still only makes economic sense to parents as long as the people who don't have children in daycare help pay for people who do. And technically it was the parents choice to get the child in the first place. \n\nBut the whole idea is that the woman who otherwise would be staying at home, would then be using other government services (like roads) without paying any tax at all because she would not be working. So it only makes economic sense for the government to pay for this, since they already are paying for so many other things.\n\nIt does get a little complicated and I must admit I'm not so good at laying out my thinking clearly. But bear with me, the above are just economical details. \n\nContrary to social democratic propaganda, I've come to believe that there is not much ethical need to work in the first place. That the main reason that governments want to get women to work is because they will have another milking cow for their militaryindustrial complex and self-serving bureaucracy. I believe that 40hrs of work per week should be more than enough to cover the needs of one family. In fact, it should be more like 10-20hrs. Ideally, those working hours should be shared by both parents...and both parents should also share in the raising of the child, as well as ideally their extended family and the rest of their community. The reality is that we now have families putting in 80hrs or more, and they hardly get time to spend with their offspring. That is only profitable for the state that wants obedient citizens that do not have the time to think for themselves. \n\nI know this line of thinking needs a lot more work. But I'm pretty sure that even daycare is inefficient use of governent resources as long as the government raises its money from taxes because that distorts the market as it is based on using force to extract the money. Naturally, I do support a completely free market, so that would be a world with absolutely no regulatory barriers between people to allow them to organise optimally in a voluntary way.\n\nHope this makes some sense.": 2, "I'm not saying Norway doesn't have oil, I'm saying /u/loserkids is a capitalist libertarian liberal anti climate change shill for neocon nwo interest groups.

Many would have made more profit had they simply bought bitcoins and held onto them instead.\n\nFor instance, buying an Antminer S7 today will cost you maybe $900 and return $7 /day (at the current difficulty) worth of bitcoin.   For me, running it costs about $3.50/day for the power using the residential rate of $0.11 per kWh that I would pay.  In China that same power might cost just $1.50.  If difficulty stayed the same, that unit, for a miner in China, would pay off in about six months.  After that, profit!   \n\nThe problem is we don't know the future difficulty.  Chances are it will continue to rise, and thus the quantity of bitcoin mined by that same S7 will drop.  So even in dollar terms, that unit might not return a profit.\n\nThat is, ... unless the exchange rate rises.    If the exchange rate rises 50% (from $370 to $550) and difficulty stays about the same, then this S7 pays off in three months.   And that can end up returning some really nice profit after that!\n\nBut in that example, the miner would likely have made even more profit putting that $900 into bitcoin (buying ~2.5 bitcoins) and then selling those coins later at $550 each and getting $1,375.\n\nSo a factor to consider is how much your cost of electricity is.  If you are paying much more than the Chinese farms do at ~$0.05 per kWh, you'll likely lose money (in dollar terms) from mining.\n\nAnother reason people mine is to have a supply of coins without having to use an exchange.

Miners will never be able to form a monopoly (unlike banks that get their privilege from governments), because the market can always either change the PoW or switch to a different cryptocurrency. That\'s why the most parties involved will act reasonably while trying to maximize profit and minimize the cost. \n\nIn the future I can even see a business model where mining operators might own exchanges at the same time. That way tx price could be totally free (or very cheap) and it would be paid for by trading fees on the exchange market. \n\nIt\'s the same as let\'s say private parks in Hong Kong.

What seems to be the real difference between the two "schools" is that one sees the settlement and payment aspects as united in Bitcoin, while the other wants separate them into layers.\n\nAs for the gold in everyday use, physical constraints might render it inconvenient, but if we had a form of gold that was easily divisible to smaller units and easy to transfer over the internet, well, it would be a different situation then, wouldn\'t it?\n\n': 3, 'This is absolutely untrue of the big blockers that I regularly converse with.

If it must be decided, it must be decided by the market, which requires a hard fork or else the choice is binary: YES to Bitcoin as it stands or NO to Bitcoin as it stands. \n\nWithout a hard fork, or at least a futures market in hard forks, it is impossible for the market to voice a choice in *what might be* rather than what is vs. nothing. As /u/justusranvier recently said, the ledger is valuable because it is uncensorable AND updatable. Messing with the updatability by artificially limiting transaction volume is messing with the fundamental driving force of the ledger\'s power. \n\nYou simply cannot have a settlement system without having wide use in commerce. Otherwise you have too little network effect; when a company is going out of business they can\'t rely on the settlement units *because they don\'t buy anything in the real commercial economy.* Something can only be trusted in settlement if it is known that there is always demand for it. All the banks simply switching to a different system, such as due to government pressure, would kill the settlement units\' value. It needs to spread as far and wide as possible. \n\nThus settlement layer and everyday commerce are intimately connected. It won\'t do to pretend that the other doesn\'t exist.

The Bitcoin-network is currently subsidized through inflation, meaning transactions cost about thirty dollars each. This vision of Bitcoin as a faster, cheaper and better payments-network is simply not tied to any technological grounding of what Bitcoin is really about. If we want to make Bitcoin a competitor to Visa or MasterCard, we would need to increase the blocksize and centralize mining so much that it is basically the same as existing payments networks. And even then, at some point, we'll reach a limit where Bitcoin is just not cost-efficient. We don't need to have all these miners crunching numbers just so people can buy a coffee. That's insane.\n\n\n**If we do not increase the blocksize, however, Bitcoin would merely be able to handle seven transactions per second, meaning its scalability is rather limited...**\n\n\n>  Scalability, be very careful with that word. If we increase the blocksize limit, the bloated blockchain would make it harder for people to run full nodes. You'd need bigger hardware to store all of the required data, so in that sense it wouldn't scale nicely at all.But if we keep the blocksize limited people can always use Bitcoin for payments, they'd just have to pay a bigger fee. This doesn't need to be a problem, in particular for the functionality of Bitcoin as an instrument to settle debts. The way banks work today is not that every transaction done between two parties is sent directly from one bank account to the other. Instead, they add up all transactions between the different banks, and settle the debts at the end of the day.In a similar way, Bitcoin could grow to become the backbone of a whole new financial paradigm, as opposed to a payments network that merely papers over the cracks of the existing monetary infrastructure.\n\n**And yet, the general public will probably not care about any of this all that much. They just want cheap and fast transactions...**\n\n\n\n>  Well, a lot of people within the Bitcoin-community care about mass adoption way too much. They want to reach it at any and all cost. It doesn't matter to them how much compromise we need to make, because they think Bitcoin will hit some critical point where \xe2\x80\x93 BAM \xe2\x80\x93 everything is revolutionized. This kind of quick fix mentality is very easy for people to grasp, but is not based around real social change. It's an illusion.It reminds me of the Esperanto movement, which had a split in the community. The Fina Venko aimed to one day reach this pivotal point where suddenly there would be some global revolution of people speaking Esperanto. This idea was later rejected by the Ra\xc5\xadmismos. The Ra\xc5\xadmismos appreciate Esperanto as a cultural movement, as a social movement, and as a language in and of itself.I reject the Fina Venko of Bitcoin. That's not to say some kind of global revolution can't happen, but this focus on it is a diversionary tactic from the real thing that matters. Lots of consumers using bitcoin in their day to day lives doesn't benefit Bitcoin. It might benefit the price, but the two are not the same.\n\n\n**So how would you suggest we move forward on a protocol-level?**\n\n\n>  I would actually suggest we step back for a second. Let\xe2\x80\x99s really fix the fundamentals of the software, and make resilient and well written Bitcoin-implementations rather than trying to stuff everything into the protocol. I'm very conservative in that regard, because Bitcoin works as it is now.There are problems, but I think that meddling with it by opening up the protocol is more of a risk than it is a benefit. Especially because a lot of developers don't see the consequences of their actions. They're just looking one step ahead when trying to fix problems, while totally ignoring all of the social implications and how it changes the politics. Bitcoinj- and Lighthouse-developer Mike Hearn, for instance, was just pushing for an extension to the protocol in order to eliminate possible double-spend transactions in point-of-sale situations. He proposed a system in which miners can vote to steal the block reward from other miners if they accept double spends. The problem is that this opens up the possibility for large mining pools to collude against smaller miners, and use this power to blacklist transactions.And this is just one example, there are many more like it. But it really is insane, it's ludicrous. Just to be able to buy coffee with our Bitcoin-creditcards, and make it a little bit more convenient, we want to destroy all of the freedom it provides? Lose out on the opportunity to enable people to economically organize themselves over wide geographical areas, between different communities, and different organizations with different financial instruments, with tools we have never before seen in the history of humanity? Do we really want to give that up for a silly dream of a few corporations that want to sell a product to consumers, to pump the price? Come on...

What's the point of doing two hard forks just because everyone is over reacting and thinking that Core won't take appropriate action to scale Bitcoin?": 2, 'Thank you, that was really interesting take on this debate, and something to mull over.': 4, '> his opinion on blocksize to me seems to align with a more banker-ish point of view in that the bitcoin blockchain should be a settlement layer as opposed to a payment system\n\nWhen people say they don\'t want Bitcoin to be a settlement layer, they are saying they don\'t want bitcoin to be money, because money and the instrument to settle debts are the same thing. Amir understands this. \n\nA payment network, on the other hand, transfers value via credit, not money. Credit is essentially a promise to settle using money later. Since a promise requires no actual exchange of a tangible asset, it can be communicated much more quickly and therefore makes for a more effective medium for easy payments. Credit cards allow us to make purchases digitally, despite the fact that our base currency is still made out of paper, because we aren\'t actually transferring money, we are transferring the promise to pay money at a later date. Most of our "money" today is actually just credit, and that is why, in my opinion, the monetary systems around the globe are in such trouble. \n\nThe main difficulty with credit is that it relies on trust. For something to be an effective money, you must minimize trust from the equation. Gold was a good money because there wasn\'t much trust required. For bitcoin, reliance on trust is kept minimum through decentralization. If the system is effectively decentralized, the creditworthiness of the system as a whole is all that matters, as opposed to individuals actors or players in charge of the system. \n\nIt seems to me that big block advocates in this whole debate don\'t really seem to care about Bitcoin as money. They don\'t fear the particular type of centralization pressures raising the block size would cause because they don\'t see the problem in bitcoin losing its status as money. They see the idea of bitcoin as settlement layer as something negative because they don\'t view bitcoin as an instrument to settle debts. They view it as a new way of transferring wealth that is somehow superior to existing credit services and they fear without an expanding block size it won\'t be able to compete with those services.\n\nPut simply, big blockers imagine bitcoin as credit. Small blockers imagine it as money. And that is the heart of the whole debate. ': 12, 'I could be mistaken but i believe he was living here: \nhttp://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/11/g8-riot-police-building-protesters': 1, 'Good to hear.': 1, 'Yes but hopefully alive': 4, "No, you're thinking of DarkMarket (which was used as the basis of openbazaar), not DarkWallet.": 2, 'Excellent post. Thank you for expressing these views.\n\n> This is absolutely untrue of the big blockers that I regularly converse with. The main thread where our discussions have gathered has been for years been titled, "Gold Collapsing. Bitcoin UP." Gold. We are hard money folks through and through.\n\nAnd unfortunately I think they are actually advocating a solution that will undermine bitcoin as "hard money."\n\nTo scale Bitcoin cannot prioritize its status as money and its status as payment network equally. I wish it could, we all do, but no one on either side has provided a scaling solution that would do that. Big blockers scaling solution reduces bitcoin\'s fundamental properties as money, small blockers scaling solution makes it work less effectively as a payment network. We have to choose. \n\nThe difference, in my mind, is that small blockers have a layered solution that will allow Bitcoin to work effectively as a payment network via credit (ideally a decentralized system also, thereby minimizing risk and trust). So all of your arguments concerning real commercial use are addressed. The fact is is that commercial use of the *base* currency is not required, you just need users to be committed to the monetary system through use of the currency, gold bugs already recognize this. If gold were to return as base money, you think people would be buying groceries using gold coins? To buy stuff online? No. Gold as base currency would still rely on systems of credit to work in the modern world. So I doubt very much that gold advocates see an inherent problem with building a credit network on top of a strong, secure, and stable base currency in the case of Bitcoin. \n\nSo while the core dev/small block vision not only offers a way to preserve bitcoin as money, it also addresses your concerns about adoption and use. The big block road map, on the other hand, will not only erode Bitcoin as money, but it will simultaneously leave us with a payment network that is, quite frankly, sub-par, particularly when compared to competing block chains like Ethereum. Once gov-coin kicks in, you will have a payment network superior to the archaic one provided by Bitcoin, plus based on a more trusted base currency. If Bitcoin\'s infrastructure maintains decentralization, on the other hand, it could actually become *more* trustworthy as a global currency than national currencies, or even global fiat currencies like the SDR.\n\nI think the confusion of the gold bugs who are big blockers is due to the fact that they mistakenly believe that Bitcoin can scale happily both preserving its status as money and its status as payment network without compromising either. If they can come up with a proposal for how to achieve that, everyone will be on board. But until they do, small blockers will see their willingness to scale Bitcoin at the expense of undermining the decentralization of the infrastructure as an attack on bitcoin\'s viability as money. They need to understand this about small blockers like Amir and Blockstream, otherwise their only explanation for why anyone would oppose immediate hard forks for a block size increase are more conspiracy theories. \n  ': 1, ">Scalability, be very careful with that word. If we increase the blocksize limit, the bloated blockchain would make it harder for people to run full nodes. You'd need bigger hardware to store all of the required data, so in that sense it wouldn't scale nicely at all.\n\nIsn't this not true? Hasn't this point been discredited? It's the bandwidth more than the HD space and hardware that is the issues of running a full node. Nothing that the blocksize will hurt.": 1, "Well by all means let's build every way that works to maintain all the features we all care about. If LN can work in the right ways then I would be fine with it, but that has yet to be shown. If the money function remains preserved even at 100MB blocks it makes sense to scale that way - the simplest way - first. If I believed we could really only go to 4MB before starting to compromise the store of value functionality, I would be a lot less bullish on Bitcoin and would be looking for alternative scaling solutions like LN. \n\nIt's just that I have never seen concrete numbers of min spec for a full node, etc. It's a funhouse of moving targets, with no reason to think the actual relevant limit is anywhere even in the ballpark of 1MB (would be a gigantic coincidence anyway).\n\nMore than that, if the limit is anywhere near here, I would like the market to be setting it, rather than some trusted devs. That requires a hard fork at least be made available so that the market can start to express itself.": 1, ">A payment network, on the other hand, transfers value via credit, not money.\n\nBitcoin **is** a payment network of a different type -- one that transfers value instantly. Just because existing electronic payment networks all transfer value via debt doesn't mean that all payment networks must.\n\n>because money and the instrument to settle debts are the same thing.\n\nThat's one aspect of money, but money is actually more than that. Money generally refers to something that can both be used to settle debts and also be used as payments for goods and services. \n\nYou are right that in general, big block advocates are less worried about risks to decentralization. Most of the ones I know still care a lot about decentralization, though. They just think that the block sizes they advocate for won't significantly harm it.\n\n>Put simply, big blockers imagine bitcoin as credit\n\nTo reiterate: your argument is that since all existing payment networks operate on credit, and since big block advocates want Bitcoin's use as a payment network to be valued, then these Bitcoiners must want Bitcoin to be used as credit. That's false. They want Bitcoin to be used as cash (recall the title of Satoshi's whitepaper). The Bitcoin payment network is the first ever payment network which has allowed this.\n\nI believe /u/ForkiusMaximus hits on a more relevant distinction below. Big blockers believe that to the extent that Bitcoin is widely used as cash, it significantly helps its utility as a settlement mechanism because of money's network effects. Small blockers tend to view these network effects as less important. \n\nNote that it's perfectly possible to both believe strongly in these network effects and also be a small blocker if you think that we're really approaching some critical block size limit right now, but in practice it seems most small blockers' reluctance to increase the block size comes from them really not seeing much benefit to a small short term increase, rather than them seeing high costs to a small short term increase.": 2, 'Good stuff.': 1, 'What if I told you Lightning is just an open source software project, and Blockstream funded its development because they believed it would be beneficial for Bitcoin?\n': 9, 'I should have put "co-founder of Darkwallet".

Those in favor of aggressively expanding block size will tend to disagree. Those in favor of the status quo will tend to agree. Of course, layering is possible and could potentially achieve both goals. And there's been some very recent discussion about just that. The interview is remarkably relevant.\n\n>Well, a lot of people within the Bitcoin-community care about mass adoption way too much. They want to reach it at any and all cost. It doesn't matter to them how much compromise we need to make, because they think Bitcoin will hit some critical point where \xe2\x80\x93 BAM \xe2\x80\x93 everything is revolutionized. This kind of quick fix mentality is very easy for people to grasp, but is not based around real social change. It's an illusion.It reminds me of the Esperanto movement, which had a split in the community. The Fina Venko aimed to one day reach this pivotal point where suddenly there would be some global revolution of people speaking Esperanto. This idea was later rejected by the Ra\xc5\xadmismos. The Ra\xc5\xadmismos appreciate Esperanto as a cultural movement, as a social movement, and as a language in and of itself.I reject the Fina Venko of Bitcoin. That's not to say some kind of global revolution can't happen, but this focus on it is a diversionary tactic from the real thing that matters.

The Segregated Witness Merkle Root, then, is included in the input field of the coinbase transaction.
