In fact, when a customer pays with cash or check, the store has to secure the cash and have them taken by person or security company to the bank to be deposited, adding a cost. That's not counting the labor cost of handling the cash at the point of sale. All of this is a cost. Card transactions appear directly in their bank account.  \n\nI understand Bitcoin does not suffer from some of these problems, but it does have its own- exchange rates, cost to convert to/from fiat, confirmation time, relatively steep learning curve, dependent upon devices (to some extent) and network connections, etc.": 1, "First, you are receiving services- as you yourself said, you don't have the option of accepting cash or checks. You do, but it's not really feasible when compared to instant payments through card companies that take a small fee, and you'd have no customers that are willing to give you 3-5% more revenue by making it inconvenient to pay you. \n\nThose services the cardholder receive drive cardholder adoption. It's clear by merchants would prefer bitcoin, but where is the incentive for a purchaser? They have to spend money to convert it, they have to spend money to send it, it's more complicated to use, they have no protections or recourse in the event of a dispute, and a mistake can cause them to lose everything they have. It seems like the bitcoin fails to align incentives with the purchasers who have the leverage. In fact the only incentive I've seen that really drives bitcoin adoption from the purchaser side is to offer discounts to those that use bitcoin- which means you are no better off than if you had paid a card processor a small fee.\n\nMy anecdotal example: I purchased a piece of furniture from overstock using Bitcoin to support their acceptance of it. They shipped me the wrong item. Rather than correcting their mistake by shipping me the new piece while waiting for the wrong piece to be returned, they made me return the wrong item first. Then I had to wait for them to process it. This took a couple of followups. Then I had to wait for them to ship the correct piece. It was 6 weeks between the time that I made the purchase and the time that I actually received the correct item. Yes, this may deal with Overstock's policies when using Bitcoin, but they have those policies because they could not place a hold on my bitcoins to force me to return their mistake, and I could not dispute the transaction for which I did not receive what I purchased. Had I used a credit card, they would have reshipped immediately and waited patiently for my return knowing they could charge the card for the wrong item should I not return it. This means that next time I make a purchase from them, I'm going to use my credit card.": 1, 'someone is going to figure out a way to make the pooled risk/insurance aspect palatable for users and ppl will be willing to pay for that.': 1, 'The cost of insurance will end up being enormous for a system with irreversible transactions where individual amateurs are primarily responsible for implementing security.': 1, "I think I made the point that the services I receive I already pay for.

The chip+pin stuff will help this significantly.  Bet you almost anything though that the 3%-5% doesn't drop accordingly.\n\nI agree that there's a layer missing in the Bitcoin setup right now.  Because of the way the chargeback system works merchants are essentially at the whim of the cardholder to pay and then not file a chargeback.  The same effect could be achieved via some form of automated escrow.\n\n": 1, 'Eh, wait until the move to pin and chip becomes main stream.

And indeed, I fully expect someday for AMEX, Visa, and Mastercard to enter this space. What they'll do is vet customers, create their own wallet, and then offer a service to vendors to guarantee the validity of payments, thereby eliminating the risk of 0-confirmation transactions. Some merchants may come to demand that you use a service like that for face-to-face instant transactions.\n\n2. Those protections (reversibility) come at a significant cost.

So the really exciting thing about Bitcoin isn\'t Bitcoin but the underpinnings of Bitcoin, which is the Blockchain.

Simple things like land registry and title insurance, escrow services, systems of record, authentication of documents, are first generation Blockchain applications that will enable even more complex Blockchain applications in second and third generation systems built on the first generation features and facilities that are enabled to dramatically reduce the cost and improve the level of services (my dream would be that the financial sector is less than 5% of the profits of all business in this country, not one of the most profitable segments, because the business of servicing business which is what the financial services is, shouldn\'t make more money than all the businesses that generate real services that end users consume like cars, movies, medical services and the like).

In some cases lawyers are stuck representing the wishes of people even if they disagree.  \nFor example in criminal cases if they know for sure someone is guilty and the person insists on claiming innocence they still have to represent them.   The options they have are to advise against and eventually to try to withdraw representation -- sometimes judges won't even allow lawyers to withdraw (even in cases when the client won't pay) - especially if there is a case well underway, an appeal or if prison is a possibility.\n\nLegal cases are also very, very complex.

They don\'t check that it\'s a double-spend, or that the inputs of the transaction are actually valid on the sidechain, or anything like that. To check these things, you need to be a full node on the sidechain, and the whole point of sidechains is to allow people to be full nodes on Bitcoin without being full nodes on all sidechains ever made. Bitcoin full nodes only verify that transactions are deep enough in the sidechain\'s block chain, trusting the majority of sidechain mining power to enforce whatever the sidechain\'s rules actually are. Therefore, a majority of sidechain miners can get *any* transaction deep enough into the sidechain\'s block chain, including a transaction sending all BTC deposited in the sidechain to themselves.

This will destroy the sidechain and prevent future mining fees, but probably it'll be very much worthwhile overall for the miners to do this.

It's also something that we were very upfront about in the sidechains paper, and part of the reason why many of us are so concerned about decentralization of bitcoin mining.\n\nIn any non-SNARK, non-extension-block version of the 2-way peg a bitcoin node does not perform full validation of the sidechain as part of the consensus rules. Therefore it is perfectly possible (by design) for a threshold majority of the miners / signers to steal the coins in the peg pool, and censor any attempt to stop them. Why by design? Because that's the promise of sidechains: performant permissionless innovation at the cost of SPV trust in the honest majority of signers / miners.\n\nSidechains we are working on (e.g. Alpha, Liquid) and Rootstock, by the looks of it, make use of a fixed set of signers instead of or in addition to reliance on >50% honest hashpower. This is because while less pure, it is ultimately safer to work with known, contracted entities as functionaries rather than 50% hashpower which at the moment is just a small handful of unaccountable people.\n\nEDIT: Although obviously the ideal end goal is fully decentralized mining, where creating a 50% hashpower cabal requires organizing thousands of people at minimum.
