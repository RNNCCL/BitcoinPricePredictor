The lower chart is the depth chart.  Hover over the red line (cumulative sells) to see the various levels. \n\nSo at this moment it shows that a ~400 BTC buy on BitSTAMP is needed to erase all sell orders below $234 (a $1 increase).    Buying ~1,500 BTC will erase all sell orders up to $240 (a $7 increase).\n\nNow why that still doesn\'t answer your question is that there is arbitrage trading occuring.  So if someone sells to you on BitSTAMP at $239, but they buy elsewhere at $233 then they will buy there to replace what they sold to you and simply list more at BitSTAMP to sell at $239.    Until your buying has exhausted all the arbitrage selling at your price, your ~1,500 buy would have little impact an hour from when you made the trade.\n\nYou could do the same thing at all exchanges simultaneously to see the order books and try to determine what total supply exists at a certain price point (e.g., $240), but then what you don\'t know is the exchanges that have dark pools.

Now the business landscape is changing/changed and Netflix-style businesses have become the new normal, driving profit margins down, so now I wouldn\'t recommend investing solely in Netflix. It is a different business phase.\n\nBitcoin however is a whole different ballgame, right now very much analogous to Netflix circa 1997. Bitcoin is a new entrant into a extremely, almost uniquely stagnant market, and it has massive, Netflix-eclipsing expansion potential. Bitcoin has the potential to grow at the expense of all government-produced currencies including the Dollar, Pound, Euro, Yen, Yuan, as well as gold, silver, and to a lesser extent, property, stocks, and government bonds, among many other assets which people use as savings tools in this age of inflationary fiat currencies.\n\nSimilarly, it is not currently widely understood that this potential for expansion is there and that Bitcoin could be the commodity to achieve this expansion. So the potential for extremely large gains exist if you are one of the people who puts the effort in to develop their opinion and make a risky call at a time when Bitcoin is on very few people\'s radars worldwide.\n\nCrucially, unlike Netflix however, Bitcoin only becomes more attractive to own as more people own it.

When the bank wishes to make a loan, they simply have to increase the customer\'s bank balance and record a loan asset. Because the customer doesn\'t usually want his loan (for a house or car or whatever) in cash, the bank doesn\'t have to wait for deposits before it can lend.

Ugh.": 1, "Hey, I'm one of the developers so I'm afraid I might be a bit biased....but I'll try and highlight some of the differences in an objective way for you (and apologies if I'm making any assumptions about your bitcoin knowledge).\n\n**Firstly are the features...**\n\non the mobile app we believe we have created a very user friendly interface that we hope should allow anybody to start using bitcoin. We have some nice features that blockchain.info lack, such as the ability to send to contacts in your phone without having to ever request an address from that user (one is generate automatically for their wallet). We also use the names and profile pictures of your contacts so you can easily see who a transaction was sent to or received from. \nAnother nice feature is on the transaction display. You can see what the value of the transaction was at the time it was sent, and compare it to the value now to see how much it has grown/decreased in value in your local currency.\nThe wallet also supports bitcoin URIs, so if you click on a bitcoin hyperlink it will launch the app automatically and fill in the address and amount on the send screen. We also have dynamic fees integrated, so when someone decides to do a stress test on the network your transaction will still have a higher chance of getting into the next block.\nWhat else....we're multi-platform ( iOS, android and web browser...like bc.info), have a qr scanner in the app, generate new addresses automatically whenever you go to the receive screen (which you can copy, email or sms to someone). Oh and you can specify the amount to receive and the generated QR code will include this.\n\n.\n\n\n**And now the technical aspects...** \n\nFirstly bc.info is not an HD (hierarchical deterministic) wallet. So for every address you generate, you need to backup the private key separately. If you ever lose one of those backups you have no way to recover the funds held in that address. You also end up with an insane amount of backups (as you should not be reusing addresses, and generating a new one every time you receive funds).\nWith our HD wallet you can create a near infinite amount of addresses and only ever need a single backup of a master private key.\nAnother advantage to using HD wallets is that we are able to generate new receiving addresses for a wallet without even needing their private keys. This allows you to never have to reuse addresses (which is bad for both parties' privacy) and still be able to send to someone without needing them to manually generate an address and send it to you.\n\nThen there is the fact that we're using multi-signature technology, 2-of-3 to be specific. There are a lot of security advantages to multisig and features that we'll be able to add (such as spending limits, kill switches, address whitelists, etc) that will help you have greater control over your bitcoins and security against theft and hackers. It also means that you can use blocktrail as a service without ever having to give us access to or control over your bitcoins, and if anything were to ever happen to blocktrail you'd still be able to access your bitcoins and send them to another wallet. This includes if we get hacked. The hackers wont have enough information to do anything to your wallet, unlike with bc.info in which case they have an encrypted private key which they could brute-force attempt, rainbow table or use some other method to crack and then empty the funds in your address.": 2}, ('New subreddit dedicated to Bitcoin Gambling on Android devices!', 5): {'This one is good too\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinGambling/': 2}, ('public ticket to bitreserve.org: Can NOT withdraw.

Important activities within the bitcoin space in fact operate within something of a black or grey market in that they are excluded or deterred from the full benefits of other supporting services in the market (such as law enforcement, judicial and restitutive legal services, and regulatory services).  \n\nSpecifically, ways for the average user to acquire bitcoin with other currencies has been notoriously difficult, and anyone being even halfway honest and observant must admit that the difficulties and costs of doing this lie almost exclusively on the fiat side (in other words, the already highly government-regulated side).  Most bitcoin users, especially early on, were very particular about privacy concerns and a certain level of anonymity in acquiring their coins.  This most certainly led to low demand and an under-investment in exchanges and firms which were attempting to provide this service on the up-and-up.  So, bitcoiners were largely left taking their chances with Gox or BitFloor, etc. We cannot assume that those who chose to use those services didn\'t value their anonymity over the risks of getting burned by a shady operator or poor security and accounting practices.  There really weren\'t many (if any) other options at the time, for getting bitcoins with fiat.  The lack of demand for exchanges which operated in full view and scrutiny of distrustful and under-informed government bureaucrats is just one of several reasons why we saw (and still see) a lack of trustworthy firms.  It is shallow analysis to blame these results squarely on poor performance of reputational mechanisms, or lack of other market regulations.  There\'s a network effect (especially for traders who are looking for liquidity and deeper volumes) in exchanges; so to me it makes sense that we didn\'t witness everybody just flee Gox as it became clear what a flaky situation that was.\n\nGovernments monopolize legislation and law enforcement and adjudication. . . and regulation for the most part.  This creates a number of conditions which produce the results you talk about:  \n\nmoral hazard-  There\'s a cultural inertia of expectation that someone else is responsible for your coins being safe, and that if something bad happens, there\'s some agency to bail you out or at least find the perpetrators and bring them to justice.\n\nregulatory uncertainty-  this one is huge.  You cannot expect any significant amount of smart money and smart management to enter a market which is so clearly going to be a target for heavy-handed intervention and attempts at coopting the tech.  Lack of competition (due in large part because of regulatory uncertainty) is probably the number one reason why few safe, affordable options existed for bitcoin buyers and traders.\n\nRegulation itself and unintended consequences from other, unrelated interventions all over the economy-  Does it even need to be explained what the IRS treating bitcoin as a commodity does to the psychology of the user who wants to transact with bitcoin as easily as cash?  Does it even need to be re-hashed what the "reputable" exchanges and brokers like Coinbase and Circle have had to become in order to afford and comply with just the regulations which have so far been enacted?\n\nTime- the bitcoin ecosystem is a whole new sphere of economic activity; one which has not yet enjoyed the same amount of time and number of minds working on the social and incentive problems which create the results you speak of.  Don\'t pretend that we didn\'t give governments decades, even centuries, to determine what bad or unscrupulous people would do in given situations and react to it accordingly.  Do you think there was some magic button that a bureacrat could have pushed before Charles Ponzi?  No, government regulated society has also had to learn through painful, costly lessons, and taken the requisite time to react accordingly.  I guarantee you the market is moving faster than government regulations in mitigating harm and malfeasance. . .but on our internet-age time-scales, we feel like protections like reputation mechanisms are taking too long. Competition and more explicit market-based regulatory mechanisms will develop and become more formalized; but it does take time and that process is being hampered by the things I already talked about.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn this lies the whole difference between good economics and bad. The bad economist sees only what immediately strikes the eye. The good economist also looks beyond.\xe2\x80\x9d -Henry Hazlitt': 7, "Every action is a choice between alternative, this is the definition of economics from Mises.\n\nEven if there is only one exchange (mtgox), you take a choice between not moving your coins OR moving them and taking the risk to be scammed.\n\nKnowing you may be scammed is not enough to not use a service, the question is : what do I earn by taking this risk, and can I afford it ? You can mitigate the risk to some extent. (eg, not putting too much money on blockchain info)\n\nBeing scammed is the cost of doing business in an area where law is lagging behind. I am not yet convinced the cost of getting scammed is higher than the cost of the regulatory apparatus, this depends on the situation. If you are an hedge fund with smart money, the cost of getting scammed is higher than the cost of your lawyers in an area with clear regulation.\n\nIf you are an individual, you may prefer taking the risk of getting scammed by exchanging bitcoin in p2p with an unknown person than complying to the regulatory paperwork and having your financial information at risks.\nSometimes, as a person, you don't even have access to justice because you can't afford a lawyer, being scammed may be less costly for you.\n\nScam is only a cost in the scheme of thing.

In fact, we have seen several persuasive arguments (eg from a mid-size Washington state miner) who said that bandwidth was only about 2% of his costs - versus other things like electricity, which could imply that the argument "bigger blocks -> greater bandwidth requirements" may not actually be valid.\n\n(2) Convincing arguments have also been made that there are *other* important measures of decentralization - some of which may actually be *much more unhealthy* than "full node count" right now. \n\nIn particular, Mike had a very persuasive blog post a while back arguing that "usage" (in terms of (a) how many users can use the network and (b) how many times per month or year can they use the network) is also a very very important measure of decentralization - and probably the one which probably has the worst "health" currently - ie, not many users now, and not able to transact many times on the network. \n\nMike argued that anything which can easily support more users doing more transactions is top priority right now - because once we get a few hundred million users routinely using (indeed: *relying on*) the block chain a few times per month, then at that point, this provides a strong prevention against the powers-that-be daring to try to sabotage or prohibit the network.\n\nI happen to agree with Mike\'s assessment here: the most anemic decentralization indicator of Bitcoin right now is the 3-7-transactions-per-seconc bottleneck. \n\nThis is simply the aspect of the system which is in most urgent need to upgrading right now, using the simplest approach possible - eg BIP 101.\n\n(3) A more mature, managerial approach to this whole thing is called "threat modeling" and again Mike, in addition to releasing working software, has also prepared the beginnings of a threat model for Bitcion. You can see it on the Google Group for the new software release.\n\nThe important thing about Mike\'s threat model is that it is *comprehensive* - ie, it attempts to enumerate all the "significant" threats to Bitcoin, and rank or prioritize them. This is the kind of thing successful managers of big projects do. And this approach has evidently shown that the centralization risk due to needlessly-small blocks (resulting in congestion which could cripple the network, or low usage which could make it easier for powerful agents to attempt to abolish it or damage it) is *worse* than the potential centralization risk due to big blocks (particularly if one listens to miners who say that block size and bandwidth are not the major constraints they deal with, and miners who say that they\'re fine with bigger blocks).\n\nI\'ve been following this whole block size debate closely for several months now, and saying "decentralist  (small block)" at this point just seems like either an accidental or wilful failure to communicate clearly, given the nuanced discussions above which have been loudly aired already.\n\nBitcoin is a real-world open-source p2p software engineering project, facing a variety of bottlenecks and threats. Any analysis or headline which does not take a more comprehensive approach towards ranking / prioritizing those bottlenecks and threats - instead focusing on a *single* bottleneck as if it were the *only* or the *highest priority* threat - is dangerously narrow.\n\n\n': 31, '> blog post a while back arguing that "usage" (in terms of (a) how many users can use the network and (b) how many times per month or year can they use the network) is also a very very important measure of decentralization\n\nBut you can surely use **a permissioned ledger\'s blockchain** many times per month with the downside of putting yourself and your savings at the whims of the Corporati who control that permissioned ledger.\n\nBottom line, this metric is impossible to objectively assess.\n\n> can easily support more users doing more transactions\n\nIf we pump Ripple\'s transactional volume above that of Bitcoin does that mean Ripple is "beating" Bitcoin?\n\nIs a Ripple transaction of equivalent value to a Bitcoin transaction?\n\nIf the answer to these questions is no, and it obviously *is*, then aren\'t "more transactions" at the cost of decentralization a really bad idea?\n\nMore transactions "fully validated" by Corporations running nodes in datacenters controlled by other Corporations sounds like a lot like Ripple to me, and you\'ve just agreed that pumping Ripple\'s transaction figures doesn\'t make it better than Bitcoin.\n\nWhat *I\'d* like to see is more transactions on LN or voting pools or Silk Road - which had a completely centralized wallet. Now *that\'s* a positive sign of growth. Which type of transaction would *you* consider more valuable? For this you might consider which type of transaction ISN\'T possible with any old payment system. After all, if you wanted a transaction that\'s entirely possible with any old payment system, you\'d just use Coinbase or Circle or Xapo. Nothing wrong with that.\n\n> once we get a few hundred million users routinely using\n\nIt\'s like you assume Bitcoin adoption occurs in a vacuum. When "CorpCoin" nodes are all controlled by Corporations in datacenters controlled by other Corporations, there will be no obvious difference between that system and a full blown permissioned ledger. Hence, when prospective users then benchmark CorpCoin\'s permissioned ledger against Bitcoin\'s non-permissioned ledger, how do you think it will effect their investment decisions going forward?\n\nHint: if you wouldn\'t invest in Ripple, you probably wouldn\'t invest in CorpCoin, this no matter how many "transactions" CorpCoin purports to handle per second.\n\n> provides a strong prevention against the powers-that-be daring to try to sabotage or prohibit the network\n\nJust like the Internet, right?

Does the entire small-block position hinge on it not being deployed?\n\nNo\n\n>>tl;dr: O(1) block propagation isn\'t in the face of an adversary.\n\n>>Unfortunately IBLT only works for scalability if all the participants are "honest" and run the algorithm as-is, rather than try to maximize revenue. The problem is still large miners: if I\'m a big miner like GHash.IO, I can earn more revenue than my competitors by including transactions that they don\'t yet have, which pushes their orphan rate up much more than it does mine. The miner will take a hit on subsidy profit temporarily, but their competitors take a much bigger hit.(1) In the future if transaction fees dominate revenue even that won\'t be true: you\'ll earn more money outright because you get a higher % of the transactions.\n\n>>One of the more disturbing things to come out of the GHash.IO "51% attack risk" meeting a few weeks ago was that GHash.IO runs their pool at a significant loss. They don\'t charge any fees, so they get no direct revenue from the pool at all, yet the idea of making their pool any smaller was something they argued strongly against. Where do they make their revenue? Well, they operate an exchange, which the pool drives customers too, and they\'ve hinted at offering "value-added" mining services - things like tx confirmation guarantees that only large pools can offer. In an environment like that it\'s easy to see why a pool would take a temporary loss to gain market share at the expense of their smaller competitors.\n\n>>Of course, that\'s not even getting into the many unsolved problems in Gavin\'s scalability calculations. For instance, if I\'m running flat out on my home connection just to keep up, how am I supposed to catch up and verify history properly when I start my node for the first time? How can I resist government regulation of mining if my pool can\'t mine over Tor? Low resource requirements are part of Bitcoin\'s "honeybadger" resilience; sacrificing that resilience isn\'t something we should take lightly.\n\n>>1) And actually, the current Bitcoin protocol is flawed in that you can mine blocks without bothering to validate the previous ones; a profit-driven miner can take advantage of IBLT to quickly figure out what mempool transactions might be spent, create blocks guaranteed to not be invalid on that basis, and never even bother to check what the previous blocks contents actually were. We\'re going to have to fix this.\n\n>>edit: make it more clear we\'re talking about scalability here, not IBLT, which is by itself a perfectly good idea and should be implemented.

Remember that if your goal is to find more blocks than other miners, you have no incentive to propagate your blocks to more than 30% of the hashing power.(1)\n\n[source 2](https://gist.github.com/gavinandresen/e20c3b5a1d4b97f79ac2#gistcomment-1285229)\n\n>Response 2: how can Bitcoin compete with blockchains that don\'t limit block space?\n\nThrough trustlessness as it always has.

I don\'t see what\'s so wrong with it. It just seems like datacenters springing up like mushrooms in a hashing rate arms race trying to chase down profits on a very level playing field all running pretty much the same software - and nobody even seems to know very much about who or where these miners are.\n\nIt seems that the incentives built into the network are keeping them competitive and honest and motivated to continue to protect the value of their investments and their network.\n\nI can\'t run a datacenter like this out of my house - but anyone with enough "boxes" can. \n\nThis seems subtly but significantly different from a company like Google which also has datacenters all over the world.\n\nAnyone with enough "boxes" can set up another bitcoin datacenter, but nobody can set up another Google datacenter.\n\nSo... in this sense, it doesn\'t really seem all that "corporate". Each datacenter may involve some kind of "corporation" - but there\'s evidently a bunch of them, and they\'re all running the same stuff, and they\'re all basically forced to cooperate to keep the system healthy (due to the way the incentives were designed).\n\nSo wouldn\'t you agree that Bitcoin mining datacenters are in this sense fundamentally different from Google search datacenters?\n\nIf so, there doesn\'t seem to be much to worry about.

I know I certainly felt exactly this way about this issue.\n\nEventually however I became more convinced by the counterarguments, such as:\n\n(1) Centralization risk is probably due more to *other* factors, not due to bandwidth requirements due to block size. This has been convincingly argued by Mike in his blog, as well as by a miner with a mid-size operation in Washington State. \n\n(2) The current bottleneck of 3-7 transactions per second worldwide itself represents a kind of centralization risk. Mike has argued very convincingly about this in his blog, saying that probably the biggest risk to Bitcoin right now is this bottleneck, because adoption by an insufficiently high number of users could mean that the powers-that-be could still try to strangle bitcoin which it\'s still in its cradle, if they wanted to - without enough of an outcry to really stop them, simply due to this arbitrarily (and dangerously low) 3-7-transactions-per-second bottleneck.\n\n(3) The only responsible approach, when dealing with so many trade-offs, is to always talk in terms of a *comprehensive* threat model, listing and prioritizing / ranking *all* recognized threats. Such a threat model has actually been set forth by Mike on the Google Group dealing with the newly released software version in question.\n\nA lot of the arguments I\'ve seen against increasing the maximum block size seem to be made in isolation: bigger blocks means slower propagation / higher bandwidth requirements, centralization is already a risk we want to avoid, therefore *no max block size increase*.\n\nI agree that bigger blocks probably do tend - to *some degree* - to reduce decentralization - but this is a multifactorial situation we\'re dealing with here, and there is no sense in making an argument based on a single isolated factor. We have to weigh all the factors together.\n\nSo this is the kind of thing that "brought me around" from my initial fear: \n\n(1) mining is *already* centralized and the main driver isn\'t block size; \n\n(2) the 3-7 transaction-per-second bottleneck is probably the biggest centralization threat we need to address right now; and \n\n(3) the only feasible approach presented so far (to prevent the network from getting congested in the near future), *based on the track record of projects and programmers who have a track record of success in the real world*, is to go with guys like\n\n-  Mike, who is taking a mature, managerial, comprehensive, practical approach here: \n\n-- attempting to alleviate the worst bottleneck, \n\n-- to address the most dangerous centralization risk, \n\n-- based on a comprehensive, prioritized threat model, and \n\n-- supported by an actual software release, \n\n-- consisting of a minimal modification to a single parameter (maximum block size), \n\n-- subject to a simple and carefully designed fork trigger (two weeks after over 750 of 1000 of previous blocks).\n\n- and Gavin:\n\n-- who seems to have a very clear notion of what "governance" (and "consensus") really mean in a this sort of situation, involving open-source p2p software running on a worldwide network involving financial incentives.\n\nIn other words, I have listened to pretty much everything from various devs and other stakeholders over the past few months, and the stuff from Mike and Gavin wound up *convincing* me (even though that had both quite definitely initially been on my shit list: Mike due to the passport thing, and Gavin due to the CIA thing).\n\nMeanwhile, the other offerings are worse:\n\n- BIP 100 (the voting thing from JGarzik) is not simple, and not predictable - so it could be inconvenient for managers, who like to do their capacity planning ahead of time.\n\n- LN from Adam Back is still vaporware, and LN itself will be highly centralized (if and when it comes into existence) - in fact the "jurisdictional centralization risk" of LN seems (to me) to be much worse than jurisdictional centralization risk due to bigger blocks.\n\n- Peter is excellent at coming up with hard-to-expect threat vectors and unusual game theory analysis, and I think he deserves our greatest respect for this, and he is obviously helping the network. \n\nMeanwhile, on the other hand, I think I can point to two examples of what one might call "over-analyzing" or "over-engineering" from Peter:, eg:\n\n- his RBF / scorched earth thing, which seems like it can mess up zero-conf stuff while needlessly complicating the protocol\n\n- his preference to implement DoS protection by deleting lower-fee transactions, rather than random transactions (the way Mike\'s 0.11B fix does)\n\nI\'m not saying that Peter\'s stuff is necessarily *wrong* - I just know that if I were a programmer proposing these solutions, and if I were working under a mature and experienced manager, then the manager would reject these solutions (and eventually I\'d come around to accepting and understanding why).\n\nIn other words, Peter tends to introduce a bit too much complexity to the overall system, merely to handle lower-priority edge cases - both in his analysis and in his solutions - and I think experience tends to show that the simpler and more generally applicable approaches tend to be more successful.\n\nSo I\'m a person who was initially wary of guys like Mike (because of proof-of-passport) and Gavin (because of the CIA meeting) - and I was way more into Adam (because he\'s a great cryptographer) and Peter (because he is able to think up all kinds of really hard-for-me-imagine threat vectors).\n\nNow, I have hard that the proof-of-passport would have been some kind of anonymous zk-SNARK thing - so maybe it wasn\'t such a red flag after all.\n\nAnd if I were a recent college grad living in Amherst (who is involved with local town meetings and such, as Gavin is) working publicly under my own name on major open-source financial software projects and I got an "invitation" to talk to the CIA - well, I probably wouldn\'t be too *thrilled* - but I\'d probably end up going and trying to make the best of it. \n\nSo what I\'m saying is - I no longer feel paranoid about Mike and Gavin.

A blockchain is most notably used to capture and record Bitcoin transactions, but has recently become an option for other transaction-driven users, like investment banks.\n\nHowever, traditional data analytics approaches are incompatible with the blockchain due to the blockchain\xe2\x80\x99s lack of a central data source, its pseudonymous data model and the way the network reaches consensus.\n\nCoinalytics\xe2\x80\x99 platform uses advanced pattern recognition and real-time online learning to mine data and provide business and risk intelligence on transactions in real-time, even before a transaction is confirmed by the network.\n\nThe platform\xe2\x80\x99s data infrastructure is architected to scale to the scope of any decentralized network, while also augmenting the blockchain\xe2\x80\x99s privacy and trust.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe concept of a blockchain is expanding rapidly into classic early technology adoption industries like financial services, supply chain management and the Internet of Things,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Federici. \xe2\x80\x9cWe believe that growth will be fueled by an ability to assess risk and make better business decisions, and we anticipate Coinalytics will be an instigator of that ability.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe seed funding from The Hive will be used to expand the company\xe2\x80\x99s technology and sales teams and fuel general company growth.\n\nAbout Coinalytics\n\nCoinalytics is a Palo Alto-based startup that is turning blockchain data into actionable insights and real-time intelligence. Founded by a team of entrepreneurs with security and data infrastructure backgrounds at Google and Amazon Web Services, Coinalytics was accelerated by 500 Startups before raising a seed round led by The Hive.\n\nRead more at http://www.virtual-strategy.com/2015/09/10/coinalytics-unveils-data-science-layer-blockchain-announces-seed-funding#axzz3lWTP4F00#RH2tlrdWUvYxkqqW.99': 1}, ('Bitcoin Survey', 21): {'Hi BResearch, thanks for your reply. Since you wrote that you are new to reddit: Please click the "reply" link at the bottom of the post that you are answering, then your answer gets attached to that post and the author gets notified of your answer. :) (Like this one.)\n\n> I am using Wikipedia\'s definition which quotes the European Central Bank and FinCEN. \n\nI was unaware that there was a standing definition now, I learned something new. :) \nI might still mention that this definition includes e.g. Frequent Flyer Miles and demarcate it in the survey, or make its first appearance a link to the definition. There has been a big jumble of people using Virtual Currency, Digital Currency, Digital Cash, and Cryptocurrency to a varying degree of interchangeableness in the past years, so I\'m probably not the only one that didn\'t know about the exact definition of "Virtual Currency".\n\n> People don\'t need to know the total as the questionnaire asks for a percentage.\n\nThe thing is that people are incredible bad at guessing small percentages of large figures. I\'m reminded of this article titled [The 1% fallacy](http://successfulsoftware.net/2013/03/11/the-1-percent-fallacy/). I don\'t have a good idea how to fix that question, though. Perhaps I\'d rather ask how Bitcoin usage will grow in comparison to current usage, but you already had that somewhere else, if I remember correctly.\n\nOther than that, I\'m glad you found my feedback useful. :)': 1, "Thanks again for all the responses which are now up to 140.\n\nAt the suggestion of a member that recently took the survey I have added a question to establish respondents amount of direct experience of using bitcoin (or other cryptocurrencies).  \n\nThe question is intentionally non-specific as I don't think people would be comfortable revealing information about payments, wallets and storage etc.\n": 1, 'Thanks for your help everyone in completing this survey... \n\nI am delighted to report that the response to the survey is now over 100 :) \n\nThis is very helpful towards making the survey statistically significant.': 1, 'Thank you to those members that have taken the survey.\n\nWe are now up to 87 responses in total. \n\nI hope you have found it interesting.\n\nOn a lighter note, Kprawn has pointed out at the bitcoin forum ... "From the results so far, it seems as though Bitcoin users are a lot of American Men in their 30\'s working in IT."   :)': 1, 'maybe r/bitcoin users are american men in their 30s working in IT': 2, 'Hi Xekyo.  Thanks for your useful feedback on the survey.  \n\nI have analyzed your comments and updated the survey where appropriate.\n\nI am using Wikipedia\'s definition which quotes the European Central Bank and FinCEN.  By this definition I don\'t think Paypal is a virtual currency and Paypal themselves don\'t consider themselves to be a virtual currency.   And if for example respondents consider World of Warcraft units to be more popular than Bitcoin there is an option to register this answer.\n\nPeople don\'t need to know the total as the questionnaire asks for a percentage. Similar to the misapprehension that that taxes do not need to be paid on bitcoin transactions, the method of payment does not extinguish the legal duty to pay tax on transactions. I believe it will be quite possible in future to distinguish cross border transactions as IFS and similar accounting standards will likely regulate that company income statements and balance sheets will contain these figures.  If a Motorcar showroom in the Bahamas imports Jaguars from England using Bitcoin, they will still have to report the transaction and profits to the revenue service.\n\nI have changed question 12 to be consistent with other questions and now reads "Governments" plural.\n\nLegislation is now being introduced in a greater number of jurisdictions that Bitcoin exchanges should require identity checks on purchase of Bitcoins with fiat currency in the same way as anti money laundering legislation specifies reporting when cash is deposited with financial institutions.  An example would be a bank in the US needing to report specified deposits of greater than 10,000 USD in value.\n\nI have changed the wording of Question 15. In addition this question has  a \'don\'t know\' option as well as an "other" option. \n\n"Low transaction costs" and "Low cost for small transactions" is not the same.  Bitcoin has a low transaction cost for large transactions relative to other payment channels, but it can also be used for micro payments, as with many other channels on very low transactions values the transaction costs can be higher than the transaction value itself.  However I might alter the wording to avoid any ambiguity.\n\nIt is true that Volatility of Exchange Rate may well be considered an advantage by users that trade currencies, however most bitcoin users will agree that the speculative bubbles has a negative impact, and that a more stable price would be advantageous to the mainstream use and acceptance of Bitcoin.  The results of of the forum survey so far show this to be of 2nd highest disadvantage.  I have sent a similar survey out to Bank Managers in the United States and United Kingdom and these results show the volatility of exchange rate was considered the most important disadvantage.\n\nQ18 completion rate is exactly the same as prior questions with lesser options, and so there is no immediate need to alter this question. However I will likely delete one or two options that get no checks in order to reduce the overall size of the question.\n\nOnce again thanks for your feedback.': 1, 'FjorXD, thanks the suggestion. I have turned the link into a hyperlink.': 1, 'I have some beef with your survey:\n\n- You don\'t define what you group in "virtual currency". The term virtual currency may also apply to services such as Frequent Flyer Miles, AmazonCoins, or PayPal balance. It is more common to use "Cryptocurrencies" to refer to blockchain based systems and alternative approaches such as Ripple. Anyway, you should probably specify terminology somewhere.\n- In Question 9 you ask what percentage people expect virtual currencies to account for. I sincerely doubt that people have any insight into the total, nor is it possible to distinguish cross border transfers from other transactions in Cryptocurrencies.\n- In Question 12 you ask whether "Do you expect the Government[...]". Which Government? Mine, yours, governments in general?\n- Question 13: " Do you expect Governments will take a practical view on Bitcoin and minimise user registration with identity checks to be limited to original purchase of Bitcoin with fiat currency?" Don\'t know how that would be minimal. Also that cannot be enforced, because I could acquire Bitcoin from an individual or get paid with them. This question doesn\'t make sense to me.\n- Question 15: " If an organisation were to introduce acceptance of virtual currencies, select which of the following risk profiles you would consider best?" That obviously depends on what kind of organization, what relative amount of turnover happens in Bitcoin, and what stake the organization has in Bitcoin. The answer options don\'t reflect useful choices.\n- Question 16: Virtual currencies are not anonymous. They are pseudonymous and may be private. "Low transaction costs" and "Low cost for small transactions" seem to be overlap.\n- Question 17: Volatility of Exchange Rate may well be considered an advantage by users that trade currencies.\n- Question 18: This has way too many lines, and is missing the most important factor: The technical capability of "virtual currencies" to actually cater to a much larger usage. Also, there are very secure methods of storing Bitcoin already, the security deficiencies are introduced mostly by users. \n\nI felt that seven choices for the level of importance was too much in many questions. You should probably revise your survey some more, and perhaps consult someone with experience in crafting surveys to get some more input.': 7, 'Actually, I don\'t find that surprising: It is a tech innovation and such usually get picked up by the tech afficionados: People interested in Open Source, Gadgets, still somewhat idealistic and so forth. ;) Spells "young adult" and "nerd" to me.\n\nAs people frequently point out, Bitcoin isn\'t that widespread yet, the user profile will only change in later adoption phases.': 1, "Please make the link a hyperlink.
