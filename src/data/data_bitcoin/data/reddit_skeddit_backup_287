Treating bitcoin as a commodity requires every person who actively trades bitcoin to report their gains and losses from that activity just as they would by trading stock. There are many strategies one can employ when calculating gains and losses that can have very different effects on your taxes, so we recommend consulting a tax advisor when the time comes. \n\nIf you are a US citizen and you are not reporting these gains and losses, then speaking for myself, I strongly recommend you start. I just don\'t personally see the risk being worth it. \n\nRegarding some of the other comments in this thread, I would like to offer this perspective: there are various risks relating to storing crypto-currency, regardless of how it is stored. Keeping control of your private keys is a good option if you are knowledgable about securing bitcoin, actively maintain that knowledge, and disciplined in the protocols you follow. Some  will argue that is even more secure. There is nothing to argue with that point of view.  I personally keep my bitcoin at Bitreserve because I have first hand knowledge of our security practices, and I can honestly say we are doing everything I would be doing personally. Plus, by storing them in Bitreserve, I have the convenience of being able to access them anytime and anywhere. \n\nFor those like me who value this convenience, and who entrust their bitcoin with a third party, then I would encourage you to inquire about how above board the company is with regards to regulations and compliance. This is a highly regulated industry and bitcoin offers no way to avoid that.\n\nI share this because you asked if you should withdraw your coins from Bitreserve. What I can tell you is that at Bitreserve we are committed to playing completely above board, by the rules, and in accordance with any and all regulations we are subject to -- whether we agree with them or not. We do that because we firmly believe that is the best and most assured way to protect the assets our members entrust with us. With every release we are advancing our platform both in design and user experience, but also in security and in the ever-so-important area of compliance. \n\nFor example, soon we will begin requiring our US members to supply us with their social security number. Every once in a while a member comes forward expressing great concern over supplying us with personal information like this, no doubt because they worry about who we share it with, and what we do with the information. At Bitreserve we do not, and will never sell personal information. Doing so would violate almost everything we believe in. We collect this information not only because the US government requires us to do so in some circumstances, but because having this information allows us to increase the security of the network as a whole. \n\nHow does having my social security number enhance security you might ask. Well, I am glad you did. :)\n\nInformation such as a social security number allows us to further verify your identity, which in turn allows to be assured you are who you say you are, and that you are not trying to defraud us. The more we can fight fraud, in the many forms it can take, the more we can protect the assets under our care. And when fraud occurs, the better we can work with law enforcement to ensure that assets are recovered and perpetrators brought to justice. Furthermore, reducing fraud helps us reduce our costs, and the lower our costs become the more savings we pass off to our members -- something we are incredibly proud to have a history of doing in the two years since we began this endeavor. Because at the end of the day that is what it is all about for us: helping people save money, have quick and easy access to *their* money, and to so safely and securely. \n\nIf anyone ever has any questions about the information we collect, how we work with governments and regulators, or about security - or honestly, about anything, just ask. You can post on reddit, or contact us privately. It is everyone\'s right to know what their banks and financial institutions do with the information given to them. \n\n': 1, '^this.

Bitcoin banner that went viral last year).  \n\n> As such, she needed little encouragement to run with the Abbybitcoin idea and, indeed, to our amazement she built the website herself in almost a day.  \n\n> She launched with the full support of FTB members and contributors.  After an announcement that was made by herself on Reddit from the same account she used to post the birthday cake and WU sign, a number of press organisations then contacted Abigail as a result of her reddit post.  \n\n> As she had little experience dealing with press enquiries and was, frankly shocked they got in touch with her at all, the same FTB member that suggested the idea (who is skilled in PR and Media) then helped Abigail construct press responses (at her request) and advised her on the best way of dealing with reddit comments etc. \n\n> This FTB member basically performed the same duties any good PR/Media assistant would.  That FTB member also gave business advice, answered her bitcoin related questions and introduced her to a number of bitcoin contacts that helped find her new projects.\n\n> **At no point did he or FTB seek compensation for any of these efforts** and, any mention of FTB in her press coverage were the result of media enquiries at the shoots themselves (since it was FTB shoots she was on with our musicians when Coindesk and Russia Today initially visited her).  At this juncture, FTB was very much in stealth mode and all members had been instructed to keep the project under wraps.  As such, very few details were given to either RT or Coindesk.\n\n> FTB has had absolutely no involvement in any of the jobs that Abigail has been on as a result of her initial exposure.\n\n> It was a pleasure working with Abigail, and having her as part of the team and we would, without a single hesitation, work with her again.  We hope both FTB members resolve their relationship problems and are able to move on from this and find brighter days.\n\n> **Ultimately though, we would like to remind Abigail that her success has been the result of her own amazing talent and hard work as a photographer (as her testimonials will attest) and that she should feel absolutely no guilt for providing photography services to bitcoin clients that are clearly very happy with the work she does.

Exchanges have\npublished customer account balances as well as proof of ownership of Bitcoin\naddressed which allow for customers and the public to determine the Bitcoin\nassets of the exchange.\nIn this work we propose using an automated software-based audit to determine\nthe solvency of Bitcoin exchanges without revealing any private data.\nMethods are proposed, based on the Flicker Trusted Computing platform, with\nwhich the audit result can be verified and trusted to be correct. An architecture\nis proposed which allows for the computation to be split into individual\npieces which iteratively compute a subset of the complete input to overcome the\nmemory limitations posed by the Flicker platform. The verification methodology\nis expanded to cover the iterative execution scenario, allowing for customers of an exchange to verify the inputs to the audit.

It is one of the least populated states in Australia (holding only 2.18% of our entire population), and is the 4th most populous state with a density of 7.2 people per square kilometre.\n\nThe fact of the matter is we have guns, and lots of people that are more than willing to use them to kill others.

What it *does* do though is it minimises the instances of these events occurring and the damage that can be done. The laws have done a great job doing that. Making sure people are trained, of sound mind, safety minded, and have guns for the right reasons is not treating people like children. I think it\'s exactly the opposite, it\'s making sure the people that use guns know how to act like adults.\n\nAnd just so we\'re clear, I\'m not anti guns. I\'ve discharged a number of weapons in my time, from rifles, to handguns, both high powered and low caliber, even the good \'ol .303, I\'m not licensed either, but I know a number of people that own and use weapons. I\'ve shot at ranges, and at friends\' farms. One of my family members even owns several weapons and they are all secure, licensed, and safe.

I assume you meant the most deaths related to a gun related rampage?\n\nBut I digress since you can\'t really use Port Arthur as an example, since it\'s an outlier at best, ancedotal at worst. Gun control laws do very little to minimize those events. As you yourself have already stated, Australia has strict gun control laws yet these problems still happen.

It's our belief that RushWallet offers the greatest amount of Bitcoin security which can be obtained in 5 seconds, and that the KryptoKit Chrome extension offers the greatest amount which can be obtained within 30.  To get significantly more secure than either will require a dedicated piece of offline hardware--either an offline computer or something like Trezor.": 1, 'We also have a fight club': 6, 'You probably meant to write "POST".': 1, 'Dormant account that made one post and one comment six months ago.\n\nHEY GUYS LIBERTYX RULES': 5, '/r/girlsgonebitcoin': 1, 'https://bitcoinxt.software/\n\n:P': 3, 'LibertyX is GREAT!

However it is very poor practice to include such sensitive data as a password in the a \'GET\' request. While it cannot be intercepted, the data would be logged in plaintext serverlogs on the receiving HTTPS server, and quite possibly also in browser history. It is probably also available to browser plugins and possibly even other applications on the client computer. At most an HTTPS URL could be reasonably allowed to include a session ID or similar non-reusable variable. It should NEVER contain static authentication tokens."': 1, 'Thanks for clarifying.
