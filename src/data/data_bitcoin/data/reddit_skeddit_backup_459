CASEY\nMay 10, 2015 6:28 p.m. ET\nNasdaq OMX Group Inc. is testing a new use of the technology that underpins the digital currency bitcoin, in a bid to transform the trading of shares in private companies.\n\nThe experiment joins a slew of financial-industry forays into bitcoin-related technology. If the effort is deemed successful, Nasdaq wants to use so-called blockchain technology in its stock market, one of the world\xe2\x80\x99s largest, and potentially shake up systems that have facilitated the trading of financial assets for decades.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cUtilizing the blockchain is a natural digital evolution for managing physical securities,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nasdaq Chief Executive Robert Greifeld. He said the technology holds the potential to \xe2\x80\x9cbenefit not only our clients, but the broader global capital markets.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nNasdaq will start its pilot project in Nasdaq Private Market, a fledgling marketplace launched in January 2014 to handle pre-IPO trading among private companies. The platform has more than 75 private companies signed up, according to the company.\n\nPrivate companies typically handle sales and transfers of shares with largely informal systems, including spreadsheets maintained by lawyers who verify transactions by hand. Nasdaq wants to replace that process with a system based on bitcoin\xe2\x80\x99s blockchain technology.\n\nThe blockchain ledger is seen by some in the financial industry as the most compelling aspect of bitcoin because it can be used beyond merely buying and selling goods or services with a new currency.\n\nThe blockchain is maintained, updated and verified by a vast global network of independently owned computers known as \xe2\x80\x9cminers\xe2\x80\x9d that collectively work to prove the ledger\xe2\x80\x99s authenticity.\n\nIn theory, this decentralized system for verifying information means transactions need no longer be channeled through banks, clearinghouses and other middlemen. Advocates say this \xe2\x80\x9ctrustless\xe2\x80\x9d structure means direct transfers of ownership can occur over the blockchain almost instantaneously without the risk of default or manipulation by an intermediating third party.\n\nOne idea is that encrypted, digital representations of share certificates could be inserted into minute bitcoin transactions known as \xe2\x80\x9cSatoshis,\xe2\x80\x9d facilitating an immediate, verifiable transfer of stock ownership from seller to buyer.\n\nStill, bitcoin-based settlement remains untested in the real world. Regulators worry about the anonymous status of the bitcoin miners that collectively manage the system. It is conceivable that bad actors might one day take over the mining network and destroy the integrity of its verification system, some say.\n\nAlso, bitcoin\xe2\x80\x99s underlying software is unable to handle the massive increase in data storage that a Wall Street settlement system would require. While the software could simply be updated, implementation will require consensus among the many, far-flung miners.\n\nNasdaq Private Market is also a relatively small project for Nasdaq so any changes there aren\xe2\x80\x99t far-reaching. At the same time, the experiment is the latest example of large financial firms exploring the use of the technology.\n\nIn recent months, the New York Stock Exchange unit of Intercontinental Exchange Inc. announced an investment in the bitcoin-trading platform Coinbase; Goldman Sachs Group Inc. invested in bitcoin consumer- services company Circle Internet Financial; and big trading firm DRW Holdings LLC said a subsidiary had \xe2\x80\x9cbegun to experiment with cryptocurrency trading.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nMeanwhile, Digital Asset Holdings, led by former J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. executive Blythe Masters, is, like Nasdaq, developing a blockchain-based system for settling transfers of securities and funds.\n\nSome see the blockchain as a way to attain a long-held securities-industry goal of real-time settlement, shifting the current \xe2\x80\x9cT+3\xe2\x80\x9d structure, in which the final transfer of funds and securities occurs three days after each trade, to \xe2\x80\x9cT+0.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nReal-time settlement has been a goal of regulators and investors alike as it would reduce the risk of counterparty failure and free up billions of dollars of capital that is sidelined during that wait period.\n\nOliver Bussmann, chief investment officer of Swiss bank UBS AG, last year said the blockchain was the biggest disrupting force in the financial sector, meaning its success could potentially have far-reaching ramifications for banks, trading houses and others. His bank has since established a special blockchain lab to study uses of the technology.\n\nNasdaq named Fredrik Voss, a vice president, as its new \xe2\x80\x9cblockchain technology evangelist\xe2\x80\x9d to lead efforts to increase use of the technology.': 96, "I'm not sure what problem that solves, or how it would solve it.

Thus, as your finger cools down the spot you're touching, fresh heat rushes in from the rest of the cooler, while the heat in your finger stays relatively close to the surface. Thus, you cool the entire cooler by a few degrees, and very quickly raise the temperature of a small part of your finger by many degrees. Ouch.

Thus, it gets warm, but not super hot (if you put only a small piece of food into the microwave, it will also heat much faster than if you put a lot in). The food is not as thermally conductive, so the wood vs. metal thing applies again. Although your finger will hurt if you touch food that you microwaved for a while, especially food with a lot of water in it.\n\nIf you run the microwave without anything inside (which may damage it), something else will get hot (walls, air, magetron).

I predict alt coins will fix these problems, and we will carry on. Because BTC was the first doesn't mean its the best.\n\n1. SHA256. A single hash algorythm is shaky. Reason, if the hash ever gets broken, the coin is worthless. Not that its a bad algorythm, but hashes do get busted. for other applications SHA256 is fine. It can simply be replaced by the myriad of other hashes. Think this is a big deal? They specificly designed a new family called SHA3, as a backup in case SHA2(of which SHA256 is part) breaks. All other applications can easily change hashing methods. crypto currency cannot. No single hash based currency is really long term solid. The solution to this problem is something similar to the X11 seen in some alt-coins. This provides 11 hashes, so if one, or a few of them are broken, the coin lives. the chances of breaking 11 unlike hashes is infinitely smaller than breaking one hash. I find this acceptable\n\n2. growing size of the block chain. At a certian point it will get to large for the average user to store locally, and too long for new clients to download. relying on lite clients will severely reduce security, as it breaks the distributed model of BTC somewhat. Eventually it will get too large for all but the largest dedicated blockchain servers\n\n3. The mining dillema. Right now BTC is mined with ASIC. as long as its profitable(in the long run) to mine bitcoin, there is no problem. However, at a certain point, its no longer going to be profitable to mine at all. The reward will dip far below the cost of eletricity and storage for these power hungry behemouths, perminantly. At this point, people who paid thousands for there rigs will sell them, and the only people who will buy them are people who intended to perform a 51% attack.

I am on the side of decreasing the interval of blocks *if it makes sense*. I defer to people who are much more experienced and clever than myself to make those judgements. I have a feeling it's not as simple as we'd all like to think, just as increasing blocksize might sound reasonable but actually isnt a simple affair.\n\nAs for how much security, on my own blockchain we're running at about 70% of litecoin's hashrate, which considering is all ASIC based is pretty secure for scrypt, but that's really not the point of this discussion.": 1, "Blocks are generated like a poisson distribution.\n\nPut simply (in the context of mining), a poisson distribution is something where every second there's a chance of something happening (the generation of a valid block), the next second the chance of that something happening is the exact same. Depending on the chance of that something happening, you can very accurately predict the rate at which 'something' happens. (actual poisson distrubitions are a little more abstract, but ah)\n\nIn the case of bitcoin, the difficulty adjustments 'retarget' the rate at which blocks are generated to 10 minutes *on average*.\n\nWhen you monitor the bitcoin network and start to observe blocks being generated which, over a period of preferably a longer time - to eliminate 'bad luck', do not align with the targeted 10 minute poisson distribution, you can quite confidently state something has gone awry. Note that you will not only check to see if the average block time is 10 minutes, but also whether the rate at which they are coming in looks like a poisson distribution - which is key.\n\nWhat's gone wrong could be anything. One of those things might be that you are being fed blocks by a (rather large) attacker which has put your node in isolation, because blocks are coming in much slower than usual. It could mean a (large) miner is withholding blocks from the network, and is trying to perform a less-than-51%-attack (because blocks will come in very soon after another). It could mean you are poorly connected to the network. It could mean the network has legitimately been having an extraordinarily bad streak of luck (which given time is more and more unlikely).\n\nIn most cases a human operator could quite accurately pinpoint the exact problem and remedy it, but let's assume for a second you are - for example - an atonomously operating - ownerless - program - a piece of software - which depends and transacts on the blockchain. You will have no ability to intelligently determine the cause of the problem, or even the ability to know there is a problem without this method of detecting a dishonest or otherwise poorly performing network, nor remedy it, but you *will* know there is a problem, at which point you may scream murder and fire and act accordingly, such as cease your operation, be more cautious before accepting transactions, etc. - until the network looks healthy once more.": 2, '>> and they work just fine.\n\n"work just fine" is unfair because those quoted coins do not have the transaction volume of Bitcoin - the blocks remain tiny and therefore propagation latency isnt an issue.

There may be incentive attacks that open up due to larger orphan rate.\n\nThe risk of reorgs will increase so the number of confirmations required to be considered safe would go up considerably (10x?). My experiments with 24 second block intervals gives 100 orphans per day (measured, but also with much smaller blocksizes) and that a 10 block reorg is feasible.\n\nHigher orphan rate means wasted hash power and less security.\n\nReducing block rate would not result in linear throughput increase.\n\nRegardless of these thoughts, there may be a happy medium, for example 5 min blocks?

Because central mining pools don't suffer from orphans, you increase the pressure to centralize.\n\nSolo mining is pretty much unfeasible anyway.

Also, that trying to train a user-base or worse, a market, to behave differently to accommodate IT constraints is a Sisyphean task. There are probably hundreds of IT experts who are concerned about the block size limit, because they can see the risks in it, which they recognize from prior (usually bitter) experience.\n\n>And, this is where the role of Core Dev is crucial. If there are major efficiencies to be had, "low-hanging fruit", then it would be wonderful to see them go live and reflected in smaller blocks etc. But right now, we can only project forwards, from what is happening with the average block size\n': 3, "My take:\n\nThe limited block size advocates usually make these two points:\n\n* larger blocks will reduce the number of nodes. Peter Todd makes this point at 10:32, when he gives an example that if there were 1 TB blocks, the number of nodes would drop\n\nWhile this is certainly true in some scenarios, this is not necessarily the case under all conditions. It is entirely possible that a smooth run-up to 1 TB blocks could be associated with no change in full node count, IF the transaction data that the 1 TB blocks consist of represents real-world transactions that pay fees. The counter-acting force to reducing node count here would be increasing economic significance of Bitcoin as the block size increases. 1 TB blocks would mean 6 million tps, which is **60 times the current total transaction throughput of the world**. A Bitcoin blockchain that is used by a market 60 times bigger than the entire world economy would very likely have hundreds of thousands of larger parties that could both afford multi GB/s broadband connections, and have an economic interest in running a full node to validate their transactions.\n\n* For Bitcoin to remain decentralized, it needs to be possible to run a full node on a typical computer\n\nThis assumes that the percentage of end-users able to participate in the Bitcoin blockchain, meaning be able to use their own private key to create and propagate a transaction, is a less important quality of decentralization than the percentage of end users able to validate the Bitcoin blockchain. \n\nThis is because, ultimately, due to technological constraints, Bitcoin can only have two out of three of the following qualities: [consumer participation (access), consumer validation, global adoption](http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/35d9ek/the_scalability_triangle_we_can_have_two_of_three/). To choose consumer validation as the metric of decentralization means holding the assumption that under global adoption scenarios, it is more decentralized for everyone to be able to validate the Bitcoin blockchain than everyone to be able to use their own private keys to move BTC on the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nI would argue that those who do not directly participate in Bitcoin, would have little to no economic interest in validating the Bitcoin blockchain. If, due to limits on block space, only 50,000 bank-sized entities are transacting BTC on a regular basis, it's reasonable to assume that very few parties outside this set will bother validating the blockchain. \n\nA strong case could be made that it is more in line with Bitcoin ethos to allow end users to trust the mining collective that controls majority hashing power to provide accurate information on transaction validity, and be able to retain control BTC on the Bitcoin blockchain with private keys that they exclusively control, than to be able to trustlessly validate the blockchain, but have to trust a Trusted Third Party bitbank to honor their claim to BTC on the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nI think for network health, the most important quality is the scale of real world economic activity and the total fees paid, relative to the block size, rather than the absolute size of blocks. As long as the value and fee density of transaction data remains constant, I believe the network becomes only more resilient as block sizes increase. The Bitcoin core devs should reconsider the design goal of restraining the block size to allow a typical computer to run a full node, and consider a hard fork that removes the hard limit and replaces it with a mechanism to smooth out block size increases, and disincentivize low value spam/bloat txs, while allowing higher-value and fee-paying txs.": 5, 'That is correct, but the issue is not currently urgent, nor are the effects of increasing it well understood, there is a need for more research, not rushing headlong into a $3.2bn trainwreck.': -1, "Well, unless you know something about the design of bitcoin that no-one else does, I really dont know what to say in reply.

I'm sure there is no substance behind the statement, banks have never done anything wrong before. \n\n/s\n\n": 3, 'WASHINGTON\xe2\x80\x94Top executives from the biggest U.S. banks, concerned about anti-Wall Street rhetoric already bubbling up on the 2016 campaign trail, are working to push back against the prevailing narrative that banks are bad.\n\nSenior executives from seven of the biggest U.S. banks gathered or dialed into a March 31 meeting on the 51st floor of the Bank of America Tower in New York to discuss the upcoming election cycle and how the firms can counteract what they view as false and damaging statements about large banks, according to emails reviewed by The Wall Street Journal and people familiar with the meeting.\n\nThe effort underscores the degree to which Wall Street remains a political punching bag and a source of anger among lawmakers and the public nearly seven years after the financial crisis. Already, several presidential candidates have lobbed criticism at Wall Street and directly attacked big banks and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass) continues to exert pressure, warning about big banks\xe2\x80\x99 efforts to roll back financial regulations.\n\nThe banks aren\xe2\x80\x99t launching a new ad campaign or lobbying blitz, people familiar with the discussions said. And many bank officials are skeptical they can do much to counteract critics without triggering more damaging backlash.\n\nThe lunchtime gathering in March, organized by John Rogers, an executive vice president at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., and James Mahoney, Bank of America Corp.\xe2\x80\x99s head of corporate communications and public policy, focused on what various candidates have said on the campaign trail, which statements were troubling and how in the course of their regular communications and outreach work bank officials could set the record straight, according to one participant.\n\nThe discussion centered on finding ways to emphasize the positive role banks play in the economy and the changes big firms have made since the 2008 crisis, particularly outside the Beltway by engaging with local media, elected officials and community leaders, the participant said.\n\nIt is unclear if the banks will continue to meet on the issue, though further discussions were likely, said people familiar with the matter.\n\nThose participating included officials from J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., Morgan Stanley, Citigroup Inc., Bank of New York Mellon Corp. and State Street Corp. The Wells Fargo & Co. official invited was on vacation. Messrs. Rogers and Mahoney briefed chief executives of the banks and other large financial firms the following week during a gathering in Washington hosted by the Financial Services Forum, a trade group that represents the CEOs of the nation\xe2\x80\x99s 19-largest financial institutions.\n\nThe banks directed requests for comment to the Financial Services Forum.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLarge financial institutions are putting new rules in place, and they are less complex, less risky, and smaller than before the crisis,\xe2\x80\x9d Financial Services Forum spokeswoman Laena Fallon said.\n\nBank officials contend the criticism from candidates and others is unwarranted. The biggest banks have sold off businesses and retreated from riskier activities penalized by post-crisis rules and boosted capital cushions to historic levels. The 2010 Dodd-Frank law also put in place numerous safeguards against future bailouts, they argue.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are always discussions that go on about the industry. Are we more risky than we were before the crisis? Have we gotten bigger? Are we trying to repeal the legislation that changed the terms under which we operate?\xe2\x80\x9d Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan, who is the Forum\xe2\x80\x99s current chairman, said Wednesday at the firm\xe2\x80\x99s annual shareholder meeting. \xe2\x80\x9cBelieve me, this isn\xe2\x80\x99t the case.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBut Wall Street has struggled to get politicians of either party to embrace the message.\n\nAttacks on Wall Street have been most pointed on the Democratic side of the still-young presidential race. The jabs have come mainly from challengers to front-runner Hillary Clinton, and in some cases seem aimed at highlighting her ties to Wall Street.\n\nVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, a self-described independent socialist, followed up his recent entry into the race by introducing legislation to break up the largest financial firms whose failure would have catastrophic economic consequences. Former Gov. Martin O\xe2\x80\x99Malley, a likely candidate, also endorses dismantling big banks and wants to reinstate Glass-Steagall, the Depression-era law that separated commercial and investment banking whose repeal was signed by President Bill Clinton.\n\nMore worrying still for Wall Street is the pressure being exerted on Mrs. Clinton by Ms. Warren and the many progressives who continue to press the Massachusetts senator to join the race.\n\nMrs. Clinton hasn\xe2\x80\x99t gone after the banks directly but she has struck a strong populist tone since hitting the trail last month. \xe2\x80\x9cElizabeth Warren never lets us forget that the work of taming Wall Street\xe2\x80\x99s irresponsible risk taking and reforming our financial system is far from finished,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Clinton wrote in a laudatory piece about the senator for Time Magazine\xe2\x80\x99s list of the 100 Most Influential People.\n\nRepublican candidates have criticized the biggest banks as still too risky, as well. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, a top contender for the GOP presidential nomination and a former adviser to big banks like Lehman Brothers and Barclays, said during an April event at St. Anselm College in Manchester, New Hampshire that Dodd-Frank has led to \xe2\x80\x9cthe consolidation of assets in larger and larger banks,\xe2\x80\x9d and that the law probably made the financial system riskier, not safer.\n\nThe bigger banks face new regulations that are designed to mitigate systemic risk, \xe2\x80\x9cbut it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t look that way to me,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Bush said.\n\nFormer Texas Gov. Rick Perry and former Hewlett-Packard Co. Chief Executive Carly Fiorina, who declared her candidacy Monday, have both said the problem of \xe2\x80\x9ctoo big to fail\xe2\x80\x9d banks still exists, or firms so large and complex the government would feel compelled to bail them out because their collapse would damage the financial system.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI agree fully with Elizabeth Warren\xe2\x80\x94crony capitalism is alive and well,\xe2\x80\x9d Ms. Fiorina said in a May 6 interview on CNBC, invoking Wall Street\xe2\x80\x99s biggest critic.\n\n\xe2\x80\x94Christina Rexrode contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Victoria McGrane at victoria.mcgrane@wsj.com': 9, "They profited Billions and Billions and were fined less than the profits (just from the drug laundering of HSBC and Wachovia.)

If you can produce an input to a hash function that results in a 32 zeros at the start, this proves that you must have tried 2^32 attempts ON AVERAGE to find that input.  If someone wants to *check* that I did the work, they only need to compute a single hash to see how many zeros are there.\n\nA similar analogy, if I send you a video clip where I have 4 dice in my hand and I throw them fairly and they all land on 6, you can conclude that I must have tried ~1300 times on average to shoot that video, but you only need to watch 1 video to accept the proof that I did the work (ignore photoshopping in this analogy since there\'s no known way to cheat hash functions).\n\nThis process is essential to securing the blockchain.  Since it\'s a distributed ledger and an open network, anyone can try to write their own "fake" ledger which tries to change what happened in the past.  In order to prove which ledger is real, we accept the one that has the most computational work built into it.  Changing even a single byte of the blockchain would require re-doing all the computational work for every block that follows the change.  So this is why bitcoin is "trustless" because you can do some simple hash checks and confirm that the ledger was produced by millions of dollars worth of computing power and years of co-operation, so your node can easily find which chain to accept as the truth.  Anyone who wants to change the past will need to have more computing power than the rest of the network combined (a 51% attack).': 2, '>What is the relationship between the miner and the node?\n\nThe network is a collection of nodes, each of which is connected to a handful of peers. When a node receives a block from one peers, it relays it to its other peers.\n\nWhere a block comes from isn\'t important. What matters is that a new block gets relayed throughout the entire network.\n\nSome nodes go further, trying to generate a new block by finding a proof-of-work. A node that generates new blocks is a miner. The way in which a miner finds proof-of-work varies, but usually involves hardware running custom ASIC chips - sometimes a warehouse full of them.\n\nThis is the "solve the equation" part of your question. But there is no equation. It\'s more like a provably fair lottery. A random number is guessed and checked. A winning guess can be communicated and checked by the network in the form of proof-of-work.\n\nBetter mining hardware means more guesses and better odds of winning.\n\nThere is no special miner protocol that the rest of the network understands. There are only nodes.': 1, 'Yeah you have to win the block in order to get transaction fees.\nHow did you picture mining would continue when all bitcoins had been mined?\nYou have to have some transaction fees then.': 1, 'Miners need node operators to relay and broadcast the blocks they mine.\n\nNode operators need miners to move the blockchain.\n\nSo miners and node operators are complement to each others.

But it makes sense.': 1, 'A full node keeps track of the blockchain by downloading / storing blocks, finding the longest chain and validating all transactions within that chain to ensure the chain follows the rules (eg. no double spends, signatures are valid, coin generation rules are followed).  They also are responsible for tracking and relaying unconfirmed transactions.\n\nA full node + wallet is everything you need to be your own bank in a trustless way.\n\nMiners simply do proof-of-work, which is just the act of repeatedly altering a block template and checking its hash until the hash is below the target difficulty.  The miner will need to obtain the block template from a full node, because only a full node would be able to know which block should be built on top of, and which transactions are valid for inclusion in the next block.\n\n> Why can\xe2\x80\x99t a miner simply solve the equation, claim the reward but without doing any heavy lifting?\n\nNot really sure what you mean by heavy lifting.  Mining itself is the most intense and expensive part of the bitcoin network, so you could say that the miners are doing the heavy lifting.  In a pooled mining setup, only the pool operator needs to run a full node, and the pool can give out block templates to the miners.': 5, 'Miners verify transactions and nodes enforce the rules so miners can just do whatever they please.

You don't win a reward as soon as you find a proof of work.  You have to propagate that block to the rest of the network, have it accepted by others, and have the main chain continue on top of it, then you're paid.  Block rewards aren't spendable until after 100 blocks for this reason, because there's a chance that your block can be orphaned after you mine it due to a network re-orgnasation (someone releases a longer competing chain which orphans your block).  Also in step 1, the block header also contains a merkle root which contains all transactions in the block including the reward payment to the address of your choice.\n\nAnd the key to the last step is that the other miners need to accept the block and begin building a block on top of it (your block becomes their new previous block).  It's possible that someone could have found a block at the same time as you, so you might have half the network mining on top of yours and half mining on top of the other.  That will be resolved when one of the halves finds the next block and produces a new longest chain, then the other half will switch and orphan the other block.": 1, "You can prune because you have confirmed the transactions you're deleting won't ever again be referenced in the blockchain, so they won't be needed for future validation. \n\nWhen you bootstrap from nothing, you don't yet know anything about the blockchain. Those transactions that the pruning nodes deleted will still be necessary *for you* to calculate that very same state they have already arrived at.\n\nSPV nodes essentially already behaves like that, they trust the proof-of-work for economic reasons (faking the chain is expensive), but full nodes BY DEFINITION can't rely on that.": 3, 'Thanks a lot! Final question: what happens if there are only full nodes (pruned nodes) left and no more archive nodes?': 2, 'A full node means fully validating node, as in it fully validates the whole chain and tracks the UTXO set.

Those miners that do not include transactions will get slightly less money and thus competition should push them out.\n\nIt is a basic and important thing that blocks are more profitable when transactions are included.\nYou must remember these miners are paid in bitcoins for their work, why would they try to destroy the value of their payment?\n\nIt sure is possible to attack the network, but its not profitable.': 2, 'Thanks, yes, then the picture I have is correct. In my opinion the difference between a pruned blockchain (plus the last 1000 blocks with all the data) and an archive blockchain is not that big for a network as powerful as the bitcoin network. If that is true then we should really start moving to (semi) pruned blockchains because the burden of running an \xe2\x80\x9carchive node\xe2\x80\x9d for free, as I do, is becoming too big in the future especially with bigger blocks.\n': 2, '>  In a pooled mining setup, only the pool operator needs to run a full node\n\nIs that true?

It doesn\'t matter who or where announces it; the most important thing for the miner is that the rest of the network hears about it as fast as possible so that it will be accepted by the rest of the network and built on top of.  If their block is slow to propagate, then someone else might come up with a competing block at the same height, and "orphan" their block.\n\nThe owner of the block reward is already baked into the block template before the miners start doing any proof of work on it.  The miner could change this prior to doing their hashing, but then they\'re not generating PoW for the pool, they are solo mining.  Solo mining is fine but you\'re going to need a very high hash rate to ever find a block.  People mine in pools so that they can reduce the variance by getting paid out in small increments for their work, with the pool taking on the variance.\n\nThe mining pool will know if its miner is working for the pool of cheating by changing the payout address, because miners have to submit partial proofs of work back to the pool regularly.  That is how the pool knows what hash rate the miner is working at.

(Block headers only.) This\'ll take only a few minutes.\n* The protocol will be changed so miners have to insert the root of a tree of all unspent outputs in their blocks. You\'ll get one of these from an old (~1000 blocks deep) block, download all unspent outputs from the network, and then verify all later blocks using this data. Now you\'re a "semi-full node".\n* Then you\'ll very slowly download old transaction data in the background. Eventually (maybe after many months) you\'ll have downloaded and verified everything and you\'ll be a real full node.\n\nDue to pruning, downloading old transaction data will require only bandwidth, not much extra storage.

This breaks the network.\n\nThere are various things that you might think of to solve this problem, and they've probably all been thought of before. The most common first-impression idea is that you'll have miners decide it. (In fact, you may have been implicitly assuming that this is how it would work, but currently even if 99% of miners mine too-large blocks, they will be ignored by the Bitcoin economy.) The problem with this is that miners nearly *always* have an incentive to create larger blocks because it gives them higher fees, but they don't have much incentive to be worried about the long-term consequences of larger blocks. You should not be *prevented* from running a full node (the only type of node with any real security) because a handful of miners in China decide to mine blocks that are too large for your bandwidth/hardware to handle.": 2, 'Yep.

Most transactions would occur over layer-2 technologies such as the lightning network; allowing one to move value trustlessly without touching the blockchain, except in case of failure.\n\nPayouts to millions of creditors can happen without friction and essentially instantly over such networks, but on the bitcoin blockchain as it exists today? Nope.': 4, 'I purchased an item from a website about a week ago.  The website asked for my shipping address and then emailed me a public address to send the money to.  I included my order number in the message section of the transaction, but the vendor did not ask me to.

I also bought a Dan Carlin podcast and he just flashed the public address on the screen and gave me five minutes to pay it.  Both these methods are assuming that my transaction will be the only one of that amount in a recent time window, right?  What is the foolproof method?

Single miners must be running a full node.": 3, 'In the future, larger blocks will not have an increased risk of being "orphaned". That\'s a deficiency in the current network, and the solution is well-known. And mining a large block is no more difficult than mining a small block. So the cost to add a new transaction to a block you\'re working on will therefore be very tiny. Not zero, since the miner still has to do some work to *add* a new transaction, but very small. Pretty much any non-zero fee makes it worthwhile.\n\nIf there is really no demand for transaction space, then the blocks will remain unfilled. But massive cheap supply of anything tends to incentivize people to use it. This was seen with SatoshiDice, which unnecessarily filled up blocks because the fees were small enough that they could easily get their users to pay them. If block size was really unlimited, obviously blocks would not have infinite size, but I\'d expect them to become extremely large with all kinds of stupid things.': 1, "The math I'm doing on this is: finding a block in an hour are (myHash/networkHash)*6.

You download every transaction, and then you have to download it again when a block is published.

Quantum computing effectively lowers the search space for this algorithm from 2^256 to 2^128, and 2^160 to 2^80 through Grover's algo, which is still plenty secure.\n\nI find it extremely unlikely for Grover's (quantum search) algorithm to be applicable to find collisions for mining valid blocks, or retrieving a colliding (valid) script out of a P2SH/RIPE-MD hash.": 3, "I am not familiar with breadwallet, but wanted to address some of the general concerns with blockchain.info (not THE blockchain).  There have been concerns with wallets stored with blockchain.info, since they store the encrypted wallet private keys.

Hacking usernames/passwords would unlock the keys to your bitcoin.\n\nBreadwallet (and Mycelium/other wallet programs/apps) store the private keys on your device.  This means that the keys aren't stored on a remote and centralized system, so they are much more difficult for others to attack.  Certainly you must use safe practices on your device, but it is generally considered more secure than a cloud service, like blockchain.info, that holds this information.

On the other hand, more frequent blocks also incentivizes solo-mining, or mining at small scale somewhat. Could go either way.\n\nThat said, there's no point in changing the confirmation time IMHO.": 2, ">If Coinbase accepts one limit and Circle accepts another\n\nBut in this scenario there is no hard-coded limit at all, so wouldn't nodes just accept everything?
