I don't think anybody wants to go back to fixed exchange rates, so there'd be no need to set up a Bretton Woods style arrangement where everything is fixed to something else.\n\nBretton Woods as a topic, I'll add, is a very important and very neglected agreement. It shaped the post-War global order, and helped make the dollar the global reserve currency of choice. Bretton Woods is normally understood to have ended in 1973 with Nixon abandoning the gold standard, so its impact today is not very large.

The big banks do this with every small commodity market, there's lots of price manipulation that can go on when the players in the market have capital exceeding hundreds of billions, and the market moves by a few million or less a day. Losses incurred by unsuccessful manipulation are easily absorbed, and depending on the commidity the gains can be large on the geopolitical front (which is where big banks operate, don't fool yourself otherwise).\n\nWhat BTC needs, as a currency, is to start having necessary commodities priced in bitcoin.
