No, I don't think the average Joe is going to stop what he's doing in the middle of the day, sit down and read the **two** sides of the flier. In fact there's actually **two** double-sided hands outs that I created. The second one describes exactly how to purchase BTC. I'll post that as well. Luckily for everyone I guess is the portability of the said hand outs. I'm almost positive that most average Joes will be able to transport the two pieces of paper after they leave and hopefully take them home to read at their leisure if they're so inclined. \n\n>Not only that but the formatting is awful to the point of being unreadable. \n\nAs far as the formatting, I earned a decent salary in a graphic design studio after college for seven years, *however* the formatting was not a priority at all for these at *this* point as my computer recently went down so I used the best option at my disposal - Pages for iOS, so please bear in mind this program would not be my first choice to design with. That being said however, if it is so awful as to be unreadable, that's certainly unacceptable and I will address it as soon as I have the time to create my own vector graphics - going down to the Apple Store tomorrow. \n\n\nThanks again, you've been very helpful,  have a good one.  http://imgur.com/6swPYnk": 1, "absolutely not, a pamphlet has to be maybe 1/10 the length of what you've put. as a personal email to a friend, this would work great, but not as something to leave around for total strangers. could I have access to text forms of this to edit so I can show you what I think would be a more effective flier?": 1, 'http://imgur.com/fJR9Qa2': 1, 'No girl would read that': 2, '>could I ever lose money using it?

I should have waited to at least have the ability to use text boxes before posting my work. I posted it, you could say, prematurely because I'm most concerned with the content - all the information being accurate (if you can't read it, that definitely doesn't help though), as I'm certainly no Bitcoin expert like a lot of people on this useful sub are. \n\nI think this is a great and informative graphic (sorry I can't say I know who to give credit to for it), but maybe not so much for the Average Joe. I've been off these last 3 days spending my time at the most frequented coffee shop.  I talked to quite a few people and at this point I'm really surprised by the looks of utter confusion I got when I asked if they had heard of BitCoin - and from the whole spectrum of coffee shop goers. \n\nMy own father who turns 70 next month and I would easily say with confidence that he's typically more tech-savvy than people half his age, like me. He teaches Photoshop at the community college and yet he had no idea as to what a cryptocurrency is - I really refused to believe him at first. And the coffee shop crowd, I think it's fair to say are typically more tech-savvy than say Average Joe. One barista knew exactly what I was talking about - he was literally the only one who had even 'heard' of, let alone 'knows' about BTC - which I'll readily admit I'm hardly a novice at best. \n\nI printed and handed out somewhat simpler fliers I made on the 13th and 14th (just basic information and how to get started - and me going over the process) to anyone who showed any interest whatsoever, but I think the more- thorough How-To's I made today seemed to inspire the more interested to hopefully follow through (but who knows - personally I think people want to know more why they should get interested in BTC to the point of feeling compelled to tell others than just how to DL a couple of apps. \n\nMost of you would probably put my overall knowledge of the intricacies of cryptocurrencies maybe a hair above Average Joe. Which is why I posted these on here (with awful formatting and all) tonight - to hopefully gain a little more knowledge and to develop the best means of spreading it. \n\nLike I said, I love the simplicity and elegance of this graphic, but if you were to put it in front of my homeboy Average Joe - he wouldn't know what the fuck he's looking at. http://imgur.com/rqJMMuohttp://imgur.com/doddAae": 2}, ('Altcoin Devs: Please pick on the blocksize debate!', 0): {'Are you sure you are posting on the correct sub? :)': 2, "They've already been dealing with the issues that come with bigger or faster blocks\n\nSome altcoins with very big blocks or very fast times have already suffered DOS style or spamming attacks": 2, "People say shitcoin test things but they don't, they just pump and dump and don't give a shit": 2}, ('Low Bitcoin Volatility now : 1.12%', 78): {"We don't even have public IPOs every week.  You will have a valuable index in several years, but it's a little early to look to a cryptocurrency VIX at this stage.\n\nRight now, low volatility is the key for nothing more than disproving specious, myopic arguments that price volatility makes bitcoin undesirable as a store of value.\n  \nLow volatility just means that the speculative froth rolling boil has calmed to a simmer.  Mark my words: we have not seen the end of price volatility.    \n\nThere's something to the saying:\n\n>Don't argue with an idiot, they'll only drag you down to their level and beat you with experience.": 1, '[deleted]': 1, 'idealists...

With 14m and change bitcoin in circulation, the market cap is $3.5b dollars.  That's the low end range for a mid-cap stock.  \n\n$790m in VC money have been put into bitcoin related startups, and that investment is accelerating greatly.\n\nIf you break down that $790m in VC money, the majority of it has been put into payment processors, exchanges, wallets, and hardware plays.  Most of these companies succeed only if bitcoin is used as a form of currency AND they are successful.  \n\nThe financial services industry, and by that I mean all it (all types of banks, exchanges, hedge funds/ investment companies, brokerages, tax and accounting systems, payment rails/networks, government regulatory bodies / public costs) costs a LOT of money.  If you consider all of the costs, it's conservative to say that it consumes 10% of the world's productive capacity.\n\nBitcoin offers the potential to automate out most of the economic costs of the present financial system, which has about 10% friction with externalities like fraud (using this term very broadly), so why would VC's invest $790m in a system that's only valued at $3.5b?  VC's have invested over 22% of the entire market cap of bitcoin in companies that mostly offer services and technologies that will only be profitable if bitcoin use grows.  \n\nIf the price stays at $245, just in terms of comparing and contrasting the size of traditional financial companies to world gross domestic product, those VC's are guilty of some seriously irrational exuberance investing so much in such a small pond.\n\nIf that's the case, we are in for a major correction, because these startups are going to start going bankrupt (especially mining companies), which will put downward pressure on the price.\n\nIf that's not the case, the price has to go up or else the VC money won't earn a reasonable return.  \n\nI don't see room for a middle ground where the price stays where it is, even if there is intentional price fixing going on in advance of the CFTC getting up to speed or some other regulatory body jumping on this, perhaps prematurely.

If I set up payment channels, the settlement date better be years in the future and the total value of the encumbrance would have to be very high. I don\'t think that I want to have to commit thousands of dollars to a contract so that I can "enjoy" the benefits of bitcoin transactions.': 3, "With Lightning you still validate the blockchain, it's still trustless and decentralized. You broadcast your transactions to lightning instead and you don't get to see all the transactions going over lightning, just the settlements between hubs.\n\nLightning is in very early dev, but that's how it could work": 1, "Right now we aren't filling blocks and the price is $0.02. It has to increase by 500x for $50 transactions (500x 3 billion market cap btw is 1.5 trillion, more than apple and Google and Microsoft put together)\n\nEven in that glorious future (if it's $50 that means so many people want to be in a block they are actually paying that), you can rent and run your own lightning node if you want, or use a few trusted nodes, the locktime scenario is just a backup in case they screw you, which they have no incentive to, because of the locktime": 1, 'But the price is only that low because currently the real cost of running the network is subsidized by the block reward. The real cost of transactions even now is much, much higher, and as the coinbase reward diminishes that cost will either get picked up by the users, or the network security will severely decline. A future where there is a low block subsidy and the network is 500x larger will result in a fee much higher than $50, if we want the same level of security. Plus, Apple and Microsoft are just two companies, I am hopeful that our sights are set higher than the value of just two American companies.': 1}, ("YTCracker: Bitcoin Barron. (Old but worth sharing.

There is a *much* larger issue here though IMHO. Please see my comment here as it would be too much for me to re-type: http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/39txam/summary_of_block_size_debate_what_did_i_miss/cs7f11g': 7, "Saturating the internet isnt the first bottle-neck.  There are multiple: hitting performance limits of desktop CPUs, hitting memory IO limits, hitting RAM limits.  As I mentioned in my other post, people who you say are doing nothing have been working on these things, like 1000 man hours work over the last year.\n\nAnother limit is that there clearly exists a limit where Bitcoin is centralised to an extent that it doesnt make sense.  Bitcoin achieves many of it's useful properties from being reasonably decentralised.  Bitcoin decentralisation is already at a low point.  This is why I said we need also work on improve decentralisation.  There is work that can be done, there are simple pool protocol changes that can improve it by removing artificial centralisation that benefits no one, and is a historic pool protocol accident.  It wont make sense beyond a certain level of centralisation because the useful properties will be eroded, and at those centralised trust levels, there are cheaper protocols, like the ones banks use today.  I and others have been working on improving Bitcoin decentralisation in these ways.\n\nIf you're really really sure that it is 100% necessary and critical for bitcoin to scale to millions of micropayments per day, maybe you could go do a startup to compete with changetip.  Personally I think micropayments are quite interesting and might prove to be a new web content monetisation model that could be more effective than advertising.  When's the last time you clicked on a web advertisement?  That doesnt mean each second of each person in the worlds web viewing, you tube viewing and web clicks etc can be broadcast worldwide in an O(n^2) network.  Thats nonsensical.\n\nIt's just not plausible to anyone that we can keep broadcasting all transactions to some say 0.1% of users (being power users, businesses etc) if we get to global usage levels for stock markets, all cash, debit card, IoT traffic etc.  The bandwidth cost will exceed the payment value at some point along that path for micropayments.  While a given node doesnt pay it, it still cant work economically to cost more in bandwidth than a payment has value; indirectly we all pay for that cost.\n\nFortunately for Bitcoin enthusiasts, which presumably includes you as well as me, Bitcoin can scale much further and more efficiently with the addition of a native cacheing layer.  It preserves pretty much all of the properties of Bitcoin, and at a much better algorithmic complexity, so that we actually could do those per click, or per second micropayments on a global basis with everyone using it.\n\nI'm not sure why you're arguing with me, I'm trying to do those things.  It probably takes a small increase to create a bit of time for the layer 2 to get implemented, which I already argued is a good idea.\n\nBtw some of the people who have been working on Bitcoin are getting disheartened by uninformed demands for unilateral hard-forks and other divisive and clearly dangerous activities, to the point of musing if they even want to work on Bitcoin anymore.  So this kind of rampage of criticism is actively hurting it's own interests.  There really arent many people in the world right now with the knowledge and skills to do the scaling work to make Bitcoin reach the next level.": 2, "Yes we agree on the issue itself. We do not agree on the presentation.\n\nLook at the other post. There is no reason to call anything an O(n ^ 2) wall. \n\nIf you are indeed scared about *saturating the internet*, you are scared about Bitcoin's success. Economic factors will kick in to stop blocksize growth way before that.": 3, 'I disagree with most of the "reasoning" provided by Mike Hearn but I do support a block size increase.': 4, '> I know people are accusing Adam of putting Blockstream before bitcoin, or of having another hidden agenda. But I don\'t think that\'s the case.\n\nThank you.

That\'s an entitlement problem; the misguided view that you are entitled to everything ever created by anybody at a price point of your own choosing.\n\n> And in the end it doesn\'t really matter if you go for piracy or just use a more convenient competitor.\n\nThere are no convenient competitors in the world of digital piracy. You are literally copying intellectual content *for free*. No one can compete with that. Intellectual content would not be created in the first place if you can\'t make money off of it. Creators would have to beg for donations or go get another job and only create in their free time, because assholes think they\'re entitled to everything for free if it doesn\'t meet their "service" standards.\n\n> An analogy could be that someone is selling a product, but they aren\'t willing to ship the product but complain when someone else makes similar product and is willing to ship it.\n\nThis is why patents exist.

There is no reason not to pirate.\n\nThis is simply not true. There are plenty of incentives not to pirate. Actually there are *only a handful* of reasons *to pirate*. The most prominent one is the fact that "it\'s free", but I\'d argue that isn\'t the actual reason why people pirate stuff. Like surely *some* people will always pirate because it\'s free, but those people wouldn\'t buy your product anyway. At least you can hope that they like it, spread the word and someone else will buy it.\n\nYou know why I pirate movies? Because there is no way to even *buy them* in my country legally. And I just want decent quality content in english, ideally with optional original subtitles. But I can\'t even get that.\n\nAnother big reason people pirate things is DRM. It just fucks people over, especially in games.\n\nAnd that... I think that\'s pretty much it. Compare that to reasons not to pirate: It\'s hard. You have to find what you are looking for, verify that it\'s what you are looking for, find it in decent quality. It\'s risky because you expose yourself to shady websites and software and could potentially get malware. It\'s often time consuming, downloads tend to be slow and download sites shitty.\n\nYeah, if the official service is worse than that, then you as a company are SOL, but that\'s why I said it is a service problem and that businesses should innovate. Selling DVDs is just no longer relevant, how can you cry that noone buys them? I don\'t even remember when I last used a CD drive - probably a few years back.\n\n> The only endgame is everyone pirates, and tell me how that\'s going to work out.\n\nPeople have been pirating since the first stuff that could be pirated existed. The endgame is *this*. As in, there is no endgame. Some people will pirate. Some people won\'t. The world is not going to burn. And piracy has even gone down overall.

The temporary pay out can last for a set amount of time (producer does not receive goods until timelock passes) or indefinitely (token never expires in digital content or provides a decryption key).\n\nThat is entirely a smart contract.  If you cripple smart contracts to prevent DRM you, by definition, cripple smart contracts.  This is also a reason why Bitcoin is heralded as an excellent financial platform.

One solution to the debt spiral is to inflate the debt away (print monetary units to pay the debt), another is to repudiate it (bankruptcy).  Either one will work.\n\nUnfortunately, it is likely that Greece will do both.  First, repudiate the debt which "will kick them from the Euro" -- AKA their central banks will no longer be allowed to create currency to fund debt.  But physical bills don\'t magically disappear and so ppl can still transact in Euro (this is very important).  Greece will probably then print their own currency so they can inflate it to fund additional programs (my guess based on the politics of the empowered party), with the end result being a "socialist paradise" where basic amenities are unavailable like we see today in Venezuela.\n\nHowever if Greece repudiated the debt, and then used Bitcoin or Gold, Euro, or USD as its currency it would do ok.  The Greek government is currently running a surplus without the debt payments.  \n\nThere are long-term advantages to using Bitcoin over Euro or USD though.  In theory at least, the monetary units created by inflation of the USD are spent in the USA producing no net economic gain/loss in the USA in general (although some argue that the wealth redistribution results in net economic gain, and others in economic loss).  However, if Greece adopts the USD, then the 2% USD unitary inflation essentially becomes a "tax" on Greece which is spent in the USA.  Therefore, a fixed-monetary-base currency would be better for Greece, than in inflationary one whose new units are spent outside the country.  Of course, today Bitcoin is more inflationary than the USD so this argument mostly applies for the 10 to 20 year time frame.\n\nIt could be that the "plan" is to use the Euro without a Greek central bank.

The argument goes something like... if it is not free to run and you have to pay $6 a month or so then people would not run a node. \n\nYet almost no one runs a node as it is. Out of an estimated 3 million bitcoin users, only 6,000 entities do so. That is probably because to run a node is already inconvenient, especially when for most people there is no reason to transact from core in light of the many SPV clients. \n\nThe only entities left that are running a node are miners, businesses, researchers and hobbyists who need to run a node for whatever reason, rather than individuals who can choose whether to run a node or not. \n\nThe only way to increase the number of nodes therefore is to increase the number of entities which **need** to run a node. I don\'t see how the number of such entities can be increased under 1mb. In fact I can see it decrease. \n\nIf we look at the lightning network, for example, it has its own security and resource requirements. Some entities which would be running a node would instead run a hub, thus dividing the "resources" between hubs and nodes which one would think would lead to a decrease of the number of nodes. \n\nOn the other hand, if the blockchain was scaled, it can be used for more applications, thus it increases in value, thus the number of businesses increase, the number of miners who wish to invest in the infrastructure increase, all of which need to run a node, thus increasing the number of nodes. \n\nTherefore, I do not understand at all the argument that 20mb would increase node centralisation when it has the potential to do the opposite, but under 1mb I think we can be sure that the number of nodes will not increase, as the application of the blockchain is capped, and it might even decrease as resources are diverged towards other settlement layers.\n\n': 90, '> You certainly can increase the number of people who need to run a full node.

That is still not a reliable measure of the number of users, but it gives a more likely upper bound for that number.\n\nComparing transactions in the blockchain with the numbers released by BitPay, the largest bitcoin payment processor, stongly suggests that 90% or more of the former is not e-payments but something else.  The chains that the author excluded are only one of several kinds of "spam" and non-payment tranactions.\n\nBut even with all that "spam", the [estimated USD transaction volume](https://blockchain.info/charts/estimated-transaction-volume-usd?showDataPoints=false&timespan=2year&show_header=true&daysAverageString=28&scale=0&address=) has not been growing at all for the past 12 months, and is still 30% less than what it was in Jan/2014.\n\nQuarterly reports by Overstock, the only US company that publishes such data, shows that sales in bitcoin have decreased after the initial peak in early 2014, and they have stopped accumulating bitcoins.\n\nThe number of full nodes is shrinking, too.\n\nFact is, the bitcoin network is *not* growing, at least not as much as the transaction count plots suggest.

It means that either the transactions have become smaller as a whole, or the increase in the transaction count is mainly due to tiny transactions that are not economically significant.\n\nEither way, the discrepancy shows that at least one of the plots is totally misleading, and that they cannot be used to prove that the network is growing (or not).  One should look for other data, like [the BitPay traffic](http://www.ofnumbers.com/2014/12/19/are-there-changes-in-the-volume-of-retail-transactions-through-bitpay-this-past-year/) or the [distribution of coins by address](https://bitinfocharts.com/top-100-richest-bitcoin-addresses.html)  These metrics too are little more than hints, but they point to stagnation rather hen growth.\n\nAnother mega price rally is possible, but increasingly unlikely as time passes.

If you use your credit card at a store, like Target, you are running the risk of them getting hacked and someone else using your credit card.\n2. If you use your credit card at any business you are trusting them to charge you the correct amount and not re-charge you later (like when you "accidentally" sign up for a subscription)\n3. When you leave money in your bank account in fiat, you can easily lose money to inflation.\n4. When you use a credit card or debit card at a store you like or to donate to a cause you believe in, you are making the merchant or charity pay an extra 2 or 3% on the total bill. (Many stores don\'t let you pay with CC unless it\'s over a certain amount.)\n5. When you travel to any other country, your credit card will often by default will charge you usurious fees to convert to the foreign currency.\n6. When you pay with credit card or debit card, you are supporting a certain richest of the rich class by letting them be gatekeepers of all transactions, you are voting with your dollars that these people deserve to charge a percentage on all transactions just because. The dollars saved if you bypass those people and spend your money at small businesses will most likely go to support the middle class, creating a healthier economy. \n7. Governments often abuse their power to print money by borrowing a lot of money because they know if they get into serious trouble they can always inflate away their debts. The US for example spends $1 trillion every 4 years just on interest payments. Even if you\'re not a libertarian you could imagine how $1 trillion could be put to a lot of good use.\n8. If you use your credit card or bank card and forget or don\'t pay the full balance or overdraft your account or go below minimum balance: the bank or credit card company will charge you high fees for your mistake (these are a major profit center for them).\n9. Credit cards have statements that go to your home and are permanently saved. If you want to buy a gift for your wife without her knowing, you might need an alternate way to pay for something\n10. Banks have their own political agendas and can be pressured by the government. If you want to spend money on something that is against those agendas, like cloud storage space on Mega or a donation to wikileaks, You can\'t do it through your credit card.\n11. If you just want to pay money to your friend, try doing it with a credit card. Not possible.\n12. Credit cards reveal your personal information to merchants. Even though it\'s not always obvious it\'s happening: your name and address information is often being leaked to the merchant, so they can spam you or sell your data\n13. Sometimes you\'ll try to pay with credit card but it will be rejected for some reason or another even though you\'ve done nothing wrong. You\'ll have to "try another card". This problem will never occur with bitcoin as long as you can broadcast a valid transaction to the network.\n14. Credit cards can\'t be used for a wide variety of transactions. For example if you want to play online poker with your friends for $1 stakes, that\'s not possible with credit cards. \n15. Credit cards have very limited ability to have joint payment decisions. Let\'s say you want an account where you and your wife have to agree before spending a large amount, that\'s possible with an easy to use Bitcoin app for iPhone but not with credit cards.\n\nCredit cards have their uses, Bitcoin is not a full replacement for them, nor was it designed to be.

No embarassment either. \n\nThe issue is that while I think the business is not worthwhile to save in and of itself, I reason it's easy to PIVOT and turn it into something else. There's already foot-traffic here and the place is well known (if you are an actor in LA, you probably know of it). I discovered that running an itnernet cafe is a pain-in-the-ass and not worth running from an entrtepeneurship point of view, but I don't want to see it go because of all the red tape it takes to set up a business. There is a slight attachment to the area since I get a series of regulars around here. I just thought I would post up on reddit to get a different perspective.": 1, "This is very, very good advice. Thank you. \n\nThe place is not bleeding money (yet). It's basically breakeven, but if sales continue to plummet it will soon. \n\nAt the same time, this is very good advice and something I acknowledge. I've been an entrepeneur in some way shape or form for 14 years now (and I've failed almost all the time). But some of the takeaways I got from my experiences are:\n\n1) Everything takes longer/costs more money than you think\n\n2) Be wary of a business partner with bad credit. If he's bad with his personal money, he'll be bad with your business money\n\n3) Stay away from competitive industries (restaurants, coffee places, copy joints, etc). You'll be working like a dog for almost no profits. It's better to be an employee if you insist on working in these industries. \n\n4) Business plans suck. Yeah, use them to a degree but your plan should be more back-of-the-envelope calculations than anything else. If you put a lot of money on a business plan up-front, you'll notice that the real world will not conform to the business plan. I speak from both experience and from friends. It's better to be flexible to a changing situation than to be predictive. \n\nThat's off the top of my head. Maybe I'll write a blog post and put it on reddit one day. But yeah, Knowing how to avoid common points of failure is far, far easier than attaing success. I learned this the hard way. \n\nI still DO think that bitcoin is a good potential entrepeneurship opportunity though, which is why I'm trying to drum up some ideas with reddit.

I think I remember the "storeownerguy" from Rise, very cool! :D\n\nYea, I believe we\'re experiencing deflation right now (actually, inflation and deflation at the same time weirdly) so non-essential sales related businesses will start feeling it. I think you\'re right to bet on Bitcoin, though. Unfortunately, it will still be a tough slog as the market is still small comparatively. \n\nI would say re-brand as Internet Services & Cafe. It looks like you\'re high on the tech end so stick with that. You can keep the print/copy service to the extent it makes money, but pare it down to be lean. Ideally it complements any new direction you take. \n\nI think you want to provide computer services and currency exchange, heavy on the Bitcoin market of course. You have an advantage with a physical location for being more trustworthy. Forget the ATM and exchange yourself. Keep all the profits. Businesses are allowed to buy and sell virtual currency as long as it\'s for their own purposes/profit. Just keep all gains records for taxes.\n\nDefinitely market to the Bitcoin community. Get on LocalBitcoins as a permanent buyer & seller. Also join, start or sponsor a local meetup if you haven\'t already. List yourself on coinmap.org of course. It looks like you\'re in a decent position near the Burbank airport. You may also get 101 freeway traffic of people coming from LAX and the 405. Become the place to be for visiting the L.A. area just as that pita shop was in N.Y. You might carry some bare minimum refreshments ala Starbucks like Perrier, coffee, pure orange juice, maybe some cookies, and grilled cheese & ham sandwiches; nothing that needs a kitchen stove or anything, a microwave/toaster tops.  \n\nThat gives you two added ways to potentially make money in addition to what you now do. You might also offer VPN computer usage for anonymous Bitcoin gambling ([this](http://www.bakersfieldnow.com/news/local/New-computer-game-arcade-uses-Internet-currency-297599051.html) comes to mind), which should be fine as you\'re not operating any sites yourself, just renting a computer. :)\n\nThis is all stuff you can start doing almost immediately with little capital investment. Best of luck :)\n\n**EDIT:** I should say for buying/selling it\'s ok at the federal level regarding FinCEN. In New York it seems you would need a "bitlicense".

I can see there being legal trouble.': 5, "I like the advice given below, some very, VERY good points to consider.  Perhaps you could cater to the Bitcoin population without converting entirely into Bitcoin focus.  Kind of like a internet cafe that caters to Bitcoin users, but without targeting such a niche market, just focused on offering services that do.  Here goes some rambling of ideas that pop in my head....   \n   \nThe locker service is actually a great idea, really like it.  Will you need to get licensing as a transmitter for this? Likewise, additional security risks?  If this is a cheap integration, i personally love the idea.   \n    \nAs a tech based company, why not offer Bitcoin classes anyhow?  Perhaps since an ATM will be around, it would be cool to keep your current image, but be the heart of the Bitcoin ecosystem around you.  Promote and partner with businesses around you willing to accept Bitcoin.  Some low cost flyers targeted at the benefits for local businesses to accept, perhaps some educational nights for them. Also, perhaps around the ATM, a local directory for those businesses in the area accepting Bticoin so users are inclined to have a reason to try... Likewise, in return, those businesses can send their customer to the Bitcoin ATM in your location to load up.  \n    \n   \nI see ATM locations as a great place to get an ecosystem going, and if it's in your location it's up to you to get everyone involved for educational purposes.  I think this would be a great start and a low cost method of bringing clients, and establishing a presence in the surrounding community.  With a few retailers on board for co promotions you really extend your reach to their clientele, but also extend your clients to them.  Win win without converting completely, just widening your offerings and availability to those who want to learn.\n     \nIt's tough to know where to cut costs or look for revenue generation without understanding the business in it's entirety, but I know your oyster is going to be in local, highly involved marketing that distinguishes your brand from other internet cafe's in the area. A localized Bitcoin project (node or miner that brings people back to check on, perhaps somehow driven/funded by the local community for some sort of involvement prize) membership savings, coffee happy hours, computer time based happy hours, low ATM rate happy hours, loyalty coffee cards, computer time rewards, branded merchandise that receives a discount when worn to your location, unique drinks and lattes from the cup up, and utilizing the lowest cost methods to reach the most individuals living, and passing by the surrounding area... How is your shop front, space for appealing signage?  Perhaps a sidewalk in the front that can be utilized for additional signage or a catchy message with daily deals or offerings unique to the area...  I can imagine there is a bunch of competition in the area, establishing presence and culture around your brand is pretty important to standing out in the area... What is it going to take to get client A to tell friend B why your business is awesome, or unique.  \n\n  \nIn my mind, the first step is understanding how much revenue is estimated for each body that walks in the door.. is it lower than expected? Is there a way to increase this by offering a new fixed cost service, or product with great margins such as merchandise?   Maybe that number is fine and the focus needs to be devoted to bringing more clients into the door... Info nights, gaming nights, competitions, video screenings, seasonal promotions, perhaps a Bitcoin club which brings in local speakers... Lots to consider depending upon your current offerings and direction you wish to go, but i think you need to use your location to it's full potential. Maybe ask your clients how your team could improve.   \n  \nWish you the best... You are already miles ahead of lots of us.  An internet cafe is something I dream of doing in the future.  But I know that when you need to save coin, creativity is your greatest asset, just don't limit your offerings to something that might not appeal to current or future clients. \n\n   ": 3, '> I discovered that running an internet cafe is a pain-in-the-ass and not worth running from an entrepreneurship point of view\n\nWhat year did you set up this cafe? just curious\n\nWell having some bitcoin services could be interesting': 1, 'Offer mail drop services....': 1, "I took over my dad's failing printing company in 2006.
