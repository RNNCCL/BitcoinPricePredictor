Our website is similar to sites like Yahoo! Answers and Chegg.  But unlike those sites, ours integrates **bitcoin, litecoin, and dogecoin** tipping to encourage users to provide thoughtful answers to others' questions.  Tipping is completely *optional* \xe2\x80\x94 creating an account and using our site is *free*!  But we highly encourage tipping as a way to encourage people to provide thoughtful answers.  For example, if you want to know how far apart the Earth and the moon are, you can ask on BitAnswers and then offer a bounty of $1 or any other amount to get your question answered.  We are hoping that this makes it easier than ever for people to get their questions answered.\n \nAnyways, we are here again to announce some exciting news.  **We now have over 750 users!**  When we made our first announcement on Reddit a few weeks ago, we had only 150 users.  Because of the Reddit community's dedicated support, we now have over 750 users.  In just a few weeks' time, we have added 600 new users, which is super exciting!  We hope that this is a signal of more good things to come, and we really thank you for your support.\n \nAlso, we have made a number of improvements to the site based on your feedback.  First, we implemented a notification system so you know when your questions have been answered and when you have been tipped.  We are also making various improvements to the user interface so that it is more appealing and intuitive.  Furthermore, we have enhanced performance by making our website faster.  Also, the new mobile version of our website is a lot easier to use.  Follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/bitanswers) for news regarding future improvements.  Future improvements will include, improved spam filters, bug testing, and a new layout for our notification system. We welcome any feedback from our users since we are always looking for ways to improve.\n \nThank you for your continued support, and feel free to check out BitAnswers.

Now this is the **important part**, remember we have to keep the name "bitcoin" but make it somehow refer to another decimal unit. So we give the 0.001 the name "New Bitcoin".\n\nSo both units will coexist, the original BTC and "New BTC" which is equal to 0.001 BTC, but only "New BTC" will be used for daily transactions. So after a few years, people will eventually drop the "New" in "New Bitcoin" and will refer to it as just "Bitcoin". This means we will eventually go back to using just "Bitcoin".

It has a topology which is the way in which devices are physically connected to each other.\n\n- A mesh network is a topology of a *communication network*. Its a way of connecting physical devices together for communication.\n\n- A distributed system is software that coordinates over a communication network. Distributed systems have their own typologies which is the way in which the software communicates in order to coordinate which may be different from the topology of the communication network that those messages are being sent over. \n\nBitcoin as a network is just software. Sure it has to run on hardware and that hardware has to communicate in order for bitcoin to function but when you talk about bitcoin you are just talking about how the software interacts. \n\nBitcoin the network has a decentralized topology. That is any bitcoin client can send messages to any other bitcoin client so long as its a valid message. There are no central servers that messages have to go to first in order to be sent to the rest of the network. This is also called p2p software. So yes it is the same topology as bittorrent and it is the same type of network (a software one) its also the same topology as a mesh network but its not the same type of network (you are not talking about how hardware is connected together but how software is) \n\nThis distinction might get a little confusing when you consider that mesh networks rely heavily on distributed systems in order to function (you might have a bunch of physical devices that are capable of communicating directly, such as smart phones, but they dont until you have software on each of them that coordinates the communication: makes the device listen for messages and relay them) \n\n\n ': 2, "> Thanks, so Bitcoin isn't a true physical mesh network because for example when a node issues a transaction it has to rely on an existing network to carry this message and know where it needs to be sent?\n\nYep.\n\n>the Internet itself is a mesh network\n\nThe defining characteristic of the internet is that it is a network of networks. An *intranet* is a network that belongs to a single organization where as the *inter*-net connects networks from different organizations. So the defining characteristic is not topology exactly. You can have a completely centralized internet both in terms of hardware and software so long as different networks are being connected with it. I think whether the internet is a meshnet is dependent on what scale you look at it. It seems to me to be a bit of a mixture of centralized and distributed bits. I could say its [distributed but not decentralized](http://i.imgur.com/u6mkGfe.jpg) or somewhere in between.\n\n>The DNS servers just act as a digital road signs pointing out the way the packets of data needs to go, they don't physically transmit the data so it's still a physical mesh network that they're just an integral part of. \n\nI think of DNS servers more as telephone books and IP addresses as telephone numbers. The big difference is that there are far more devices out there than people and the locations are constantly changing for a lot of them. So not only would a phone book for servers be huge, it would be constantly changing. DNS servers solve this problem by having a fixed IP address so that everyone can connect to them and get the latest IP address of a server without having to download the whole record of every IP address. Packet switched networks direct a packet one way or another (or multiple ways) depending on its IP address alone since they dont know anything about domain names any more than automatic telephone switch boards know about the names of the people who use the telephone numbers they are switching the lines to connect.

Bitcoin-only: Buyer needs bitcoins to buy tickets. In this case no 3rd party involvement is necessary, event organizer only needs to install a piece of software which does it. In fact it is already possible through ChromaWallet, but UX is very bad. But it's something which can be improved, and even technologically-unsavvy event organizers will be able to use it.\n\n2. Legacy: Tickets are bought using fiat money, through centralized outlets. Event organizer sends tickets he have issued to an outlet, outlet sells them (distributing colored coins to buyers), and eventually sends money to the organizer. How is it better than Ticketmaster? Well, an outlet does just one thing (processes fiat payments, which we can't avoid in this scenario), and it should be easy to change them. So I expect that to become a commodity service.\n\nThird parties aren't inherently bad, they just shouldn't be allowed to become monopolists (at which point they can start abusing their position).\n\nE.g. in Bitcoin world we have Coinbase and Circle doing roughly the same thing. If Coinbase will start charging high fees, Circle will simply eat its market share": 1, "Ticketmaster already has a ticket auction service for event organizers and venues. In what ways would your potential solution be better than Ticketmaster's?": 1, 'The ticket seller will have to set up a server which will perform ticket authentication and facilitate exchange. It is definitely doable, but is associated with some costs (not just the server itself, but also a person which would keep it working and safe), and carries some risks.\n\nThe payment processing is the most problematic part. Let\'s consider two cases:\n\n1. Bitcoin-only. You only need a piece of software to do that, payments will go from person to person directly, and you will just update ownership database accordingly. The problem is that if your trade server is hijacked, attacker can do a lot of damage either by redirecting payments to his address, or by selling fake tickets. So it doesn\'t matter that your server never touches money, you\'re still risking an amount equivalent to trade value. Also note that running a server which facilitates exchange might be problematic due to regulations.\n2. Fiat currencies... Do i need to explain why processing user-to-user payments is problematic?\n\nSo this isn\'t something which a small, individual company would like to do. They would rather outsource it to a company which specializes in these things, which is how it works now: TIcketmaster, StubHub...\n\nBigger companies benefit from economies of scale, but they won\'t pass these savings on to customers. Also they might abuse their monopolist status...\n\nAnd in what sense would be a centralized system simpler?\n\nA solution like this would need authentication, ownership tracking and exchange components. In one case they are integrated with the blockchain and in another they aren\'t. It\'s hard to say what\'s simpler because you\'ll be reusing some existing stuff in both cases.\n\nSo the proposal is to outsource ownership tracking to the blockchain (instead of outsourcing it to big centralized companies). Then you also get authentication service for free (sort of): one can verify colored coin by downloading the blockchain.\n\nThis leaves us with exchange and sale services. Exchange can be done either in a decentralized fashion, or it can be facilitate by some party. It doesn\'t matter that much, because the blockchain-based ownership tracking system serves as a common layer, you can even mix and match.\n\nA centralized exchange has high fees? You go to another one, or do it in decentralized fashion.\n\nWhich leaves us with \'sale\' part, which can either be done directly by the issuer (i.e. auction service) or can be outsources to some centralized service which will buy tickets in bulk and then auction them.\n\nFinally, "they control".

It doesn't ask if it can or confirm that it's possible, it just explains that it happened. Even if that bank account doesn't exist, Coinbase's bank can only assume that the transaction was successful.\n\nThis is where the delay comes into play. For your bank to explain that the transaction was not successful, they must do the same thing in reverse whenever they get around to it. If the transaction was successful, they don't send anything back at all. To make matters worse, these transmissions only happen once per day in a large batch.\n\nTo put this to an example, here is the *best case* lifecycle for a transaction that fails that is sent on a Monday before the batch for the day has already been sent:\n\nMonday afternoon: Added to the daily batch and sent by Coinbase's bank.\n\nTuesday: Transaction is received by your bank. Failure message is sent by your bank.\n\nWednesday morning: Failure received by Coinbase's bank.\n\nThat is 3 business days right there, and that's the absolute best case scenario. If you miss the cut-off time for the daily batch, add an extra day. If a bank is in a bad mood, add a few more days.\n\nBecause this system only informs the sender of errors, not successes, Coinbase has to wait as long as the longest possible delay for hearing about errors before they can somewhat safely assume that the transaction wasn't rejected for basic clerical reasons (of course, reversals for things like unauthorized transactions can happen after a much longer period of time, but that's not the purpose of this specific waiting period).\n\nAs for bitcoin-to-fiat, it's possible that Coinbase doesn't keep much of a balance in their bank account (a very good idea, because you don't want all of your company's funds tied up if your ACH processor decides that they don't like you any more). As a result, their bank has to wait a couple of days to make sure that Coinbase really did have the account balance that they seemed to have when the transactions were originally requested. This is because any/all of the credits that Coinbase has pulled in during the past few days might not exist.\n\nCompanies like PayPal either segregate their sending account from their receiving account, or are trusted enough by their bank to be extended a line of credit should something go terribly wrong.\n\nFor more info:\n\nhttp://engineering.zenpayroll.com/how-ach-works-a-developer-perspective-part-1/\nhttp://engineering.zenpayroll.com/how-ach-works-a-developer-perspective-part-2/\nhttp://engineering.zenpayroll.com/how-ach-works-a-developer-perspective-part-3/": 2, "I was about to reply with those same links :-) I read those several months ago. \n\nI'm don't really care about the Fiat to BTC side. I can understand a 3 or 4 day delay. \n\nIt's the BTC to Fiat side that doesn't make sense. Coinbase should be able to upload their transactions to their ACH processor before 7pm and the USD be in the accounts of their customers by the next morning. \n\nEdit: For reference, I made a sell order at Coinbase on a Friday and it didn't hit my account until the next Friday. I called my bank and talked to the ACH department who informed that the first their system saw it was Thursday night during regular processing.

No, we have no idea what the relationship is, but we can be 100% sure that the correlation is *positive* -- that is, if the userbase of reddit increases, then the number of accounts must *necessarily* have increased.  Having established that the correlation is positive, reducing the rate of new account formation (assuming it\'s done in an independent way -- i.e. applied uniformly to all new accounts) will necessarily decrease the rate of new user adoption.  This follows trivially, because it sure as hell won\'t increase it.\n\nYour statement that "...the amount of \'accounts\' will be lowered, but this is a highly inflated statistic and holds no relevance to Reddit\'s or /r/bitcoin\'s actual growth." is completely and blatantly false.  If you define growth as user adoption (which is a completely reasonable metric) then decreasing the rate of account growth will *at best* not change the rate of user adoption ***if the new measures only ever stopped alt account formation and never hindered a legitimate user from registering*** -- which is a completely ridiculous scenario to begin with!\n\nI\'m even completely disregarding the fact that you are literally considering /r/bitcoin to be representative of all of reddit (which is ridiculous, because it\'s a subset thereof, and is certainly not characteristic of the entire site).  Contrary to what you may believe, what\'s bad for /r/bitcoin is not necessarily bad for reddit.  Alt account formation may piss off some /r/bitcoiners who think theirs is the only opinion to have ever been challenged on the internet, but the ease of account creation on reddit as a whole is definitely a reason for its past growth (lurkers convert to users more easily, alt accounts allow for all sorts of shenanigans like anonymous AskReddit threads, etc.)\n\nYou are wrong on so many levels that it stopped being sad and started being funny.': 2, 'this is actually an great idea, something like bitmessage could definitively reduce spam without censoring anything.': 3, "Reddit is a centralised service.

Human nature prevents most people who disagree from being nice about it, and ego usually prevents people in a place where everyone disagrees with them from being perfectly civil. \n\nWanting to keep open dialog with opposing viewpoints requires a fairly generous allowance for the unfortunate natural trappings of such disagreement.
