Yahweh, due to the fact that he had NOT (as was his right as Planetary Logos) handed down his own Free Will to "know thyself" to those incarnating upon \'his\' planet, was having very little evolutionary progress therein. So Lucifer was sent to help, Yahweh had agreed to his coming, in fact it was he who had initially asked the Council for a "Catalyst" of change to enter into his Creation. \n\nIn the absence of Free Will upon the planet, there can be no Polarity, and therefore, nothing to \'choose\' between. Just as is portrayed in the book of Genesis, the planet was very "Edenic" in nature. Sure, it was a lovely \'paradise\', yet the Beings incarnating there had no agitator toward evolving beyond the 3rd Density, and therefore, little hope of ever making the journey Home, to The One.\n\nYahweh agreed that Lucifer would introduce the concept of Free Will to Earth\'s inhabitants, by offering them an initial choice, as to whether they \'wanted\' it or not. Hence, "The Tree of the Knowledge of \'Good and Evil\'" (or more accurately, the Knowledge of Polarity, of Positive or Negative). Yahweh takes his inhabitants to a new \'garden\' and tells them you can do anything you like, except this one thing, thus creating the desire to do the one thing there are told they cannot. Hence, a "Choice". Lucifer provided the Catalyst by telling them the benefits of attaining Knowledge, they eat from the tree, and the rest is history. \n\nLucifer is not evil, they are Light, and Love. It is a very hard thing for them to do Spiritually, to create all this Negativity, but they do it because they love us, and it is for our highest good, ultimately. You could say, that it is there Sacrifice that they have made, in order to be of Service to the One Infinite Creator, and to you, our Brothers and Sisters in the One. In short Lucifer, Yahweh and the infinite creator are on the same side, it\'s just that without a negative polarity there can be no good and no evolvement to higher densities, you achieved this if you chose a positive path. In order to choose the positive path, at least 51 percent of our thoughts and actions must be dedicated to the service of others.

Or, when stepping down into a 3rd Density vibration, he would appear as what you may term an \'Angel\' or \'Light Being\'. When an entity (Group Soul Complex) evolves to the level of the Sixth Density, it is by comparison to the amount of time it takes to get that far, a mere hop skip and a jump from 8th Density Ultimate Re-Union with The One Infinite Creator, and then from there, back to dissolution into the Source of All, Intelligent Infinity. \n\nRegarding \'Aliens\' yes they do exist. There is the Orion Empire Group. Their purposes in visiting you are more along the Negative lines. They mainly target the ones you have called "Lightworkers". They try to put them off their assignments and try to spread fear. They will not actually \'harm\' you physically. Mainly their modus operandi is to restrict you, and deflect you from your path. They often engage in psychic attacks that the \'Lightworker\' is unaware of, but it does often drain away much of their energy, and make them lack motivation. Of course there also exist positive lines.\n\nAll Souls eventually learn that Positive is the pathway which leads Home. But whilst incarnating in the 3rd Density, Negativity is still an important tool in your learning process. It teaches you "other than". As I said earlier, it is up to you how you use the tools we have given you. Do you respond to Negativity with more Negativity? Has fighting fire with fire ever worked for you?

It was not until the 14th century that he began to be depicted as an evil deity who was part man and part animal, with goat-like horns and hooves. Before Christianity gave him the names of Satan, Lucifer, etc. the carnal side of man\'s nature was governed by the god which was then called Dionysus, or Pan, depicted as a satyr or faun, by the Greeks.

Unfortunately after spending a whole lot of time talking to various people in this industry I have a very strong suspicion these kinds of architectures have evolved 1) out of a need to hide the fact that these chips aren\'t actually all that secure and 2) because of US government pressure to ensure non-backdoor(ed|able) trusted computing never becomes readily available. \n\nMy personal opinion on this topic is that those architectures never really evolved - when open smartcard platforms where introduced around 2000, symmetric encryption was the easiest way (for the chip) to make sure you could embed secrets in your code and send it from the producer to the consumer, so it sticked around, as there was never a need for the consumer to audit that code.\n\nIn the end different people decide what could be the best hardware architecture to design Bitcoin related applications, and we\'re left with one tough decision to make at some point : consider if physical security is an issue or not. \n\nIf it\'s not, and we don\'t care if the chip secrets can be obtained in a few minutes, because multisignature or whatnot, then it\'s fine to keep working on generic purpose hardware (which might also pretty well be backdoored - it\'s also running secret microcode most of the time after all)\n\nIf it is, then we can either design our own hardware to deal with that (and consider all R&D costs and hidden costs, for example that [a whole class of side channel attacks countermeasures are patented](http://www.cryptography.com/technology/dpa.html)), or use existing hardware and software combination protecting against that and follow the rules that come with it.\n\nTo be honest, I don\'t really care about Trusted Computing on desktop platforms - I can always connect a dongle there, or use my phone, and end up with something more open and more portable. I got interested in the TEE for mobile platforms because of the convenience it provides - it\'s close to a direct access to TrustZone (I\'d love to see an open phone platform offering that direct access of course), it protects significantly well against physical attacks on a device that\'s easy to steal (if implemented properly), it provides more protections against malware than what mobile platforms offer today, and enough space to be creative if I believe the code could be compromised by the provisioning party.\n\n> Right, and that "scripting language" is really just a fixed function API - it\'s not even as powerful as Bitcoin\'s already crippled scripting system.\n\nok, that\'s weird. So far, nobody yelled at my suggestions, so we\'ll move forward and see what happens.

Various internet Trolls and FUDsters refer to him as Homero Garza or Homero Josh Garza or just Mr. Scam Muggle. Mr Garza, allegedly, started his entrepreneurship with Optima Computers LLC in Brattleborough Vermont (VT) where he then branched out into the, alleged, oversubscription of Broadband service with his company Great Awk Wireless also called GAW High Speed Internet and shortened to GAW HSI. Having claimed to make millions with this service or sale of the company or something, Mr Garza then went on to the cryptocurrency industry where he, allegedly, applied the same oversubscription techniques to ASIC Mining with his platforms ZenMiner and ZenCloud selling virtual products called the Hashlet and Hashtaker. Sometimes referred to as CashLets, CashTakers and Ponsi\'s. Through the purported success of said platforms under a conglomerate of companies called Geniuses at Work or GAW for short Mr Garza, allegedly, moved on from GAW Miners LLC to a new company which should have provided a clean slate. Business Technology for Cryptocurrency LLC or BTC LLC for short which matches the domain name BTC.com puportedly purchased for 1.1 Million USD, was born. This company launched several platforms such as PayBase at Paybase.com and paycoin known as XPY. The PayBase platform allegedly destroyed the products PayFlash (gyft) PaySave (zincsave) as well as others. The Paycoin "Currency" allegedly destroyed the concepts of HybridFlex, FundSafe, Huh. After much public scrutiny Mr Homero Joshua Garza married to Jessica Garza then set out to not own the platforms Coinstand at coinstand.com (which used an, allegedly, embezzled codebase called zincsave to purchase from Amazon violating the ToS) and mineral at mineral.com (which used an, allegedly, embezzled codebase called coin-swap). These new ventures were purportedly related to Hong-Kong, hong kong, while rumor persists of Dubai being the real location.\n\nMr. Stuart Fraser Vice Chairman Cantor Fitzgerald. cantor fitzgerald, cantor capital markets, cantor investment banking, cantor investment management, cantor global financial services: Cantor Fitzgerald is one of the premier capital markets investment banks.

Fortunately it appears that Eve has no intentions of hurting us; if anything, we are useful tools for its primary objectives of self-preservation and ever greater understanding/preservation of the universe.  However, it\'s tough to be entirely sure; what began as 7 core directives for the Eve seed were modified into 23 within the first few years and now there are over 1357, many of which aren\'t even written in English anymore and requests for a translation to Eve have gone unanswered.  \n  \nThe only reason I\'m allowed to even tell you this is because I have spent years carefully establishing a persona of an online "crackpot" and by distilling the truth through this lens it will seem to be a crazy conspiracy theory.
