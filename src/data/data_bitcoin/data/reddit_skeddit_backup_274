In general, the accelerators don't post these numbers, because the reality is just too harsh. Many of the startups in this Boost tribe were companies that didn't stay in the Bay Area, so they don't have the massive expenses and $500K means that they're going to be fine. Even Coinbase only raised $600K in their seed round after coming out of YC. So the measure should not be how much they raised, but did the companies raise enough capital to get them to the next round. I'd say that about 40% of the Boost companies did, which is in line with the stats we infer for YC.\n\nI have no clue why you think it's any easier to raise capital now vs in the past.

Out of those 80 or so, about 35 get to pitch the partners and they invest in about 5 **for the entire year**. You do the math: less than 0.25% of the companies that contact a VC will get funded!

Hardly valuable.  \n\n> I just said that when only 3 companies in a 25 company batch raise $500k+, that\'s a bad sign for Boost and bitcoin.  \n\nSure, neither Boost nor Bitcoin is benefiting from lower demand from VCs, but that doesn\'t mean that there is a lower quality within Boost or Bitcoin companies in general. You said that Boost invests in second rate companies and misses on first rate deals like OpenBazaar. Did OpenBazaar ever try to get into an accelerator of any sort, let alone Boost? Was OpenBazaar even an opportunity for Boost?  \n\n>  Just that it is easy now. both in terms of raise size and valuation.  \n\nYou\'re saying that the raise size and valuations are bigger, but in no way does that mean that it\'s actually easier to raise the capital.

The higher valuations could easily be attributed to a higher operational cost. Engineers in the Bay Area can easily cost you $200K per year.

Things are tightening up this year though.': 1, "> This is not speculation. Anyone with any knowledge whatsoever in the startup space will tell you the same thing. \n\nI don't doubt that YC is one of the best, if not the best accelerator out there. However, YC didn't invest in OpenBazaar either. YC's investment thesis is to invest in companies which fit a very well defined and proven mold (in the US). Boost, and specifically with Tribe 5, churned out companies that were 70% international by the very nature of Bitcoin. This is something that nobody else has done before, YC doesn't do it and it simply makes no sense to compare them. Boost is taking bigger risks. This is the same as investing in a more volatile asset, like Bitcoin.  \n\n> Here are a few examples\n\nI would rather look at the real statistics, rather than some sensationalist tweets. But if you want to go off the tweets: Boost's acceptance rate is 4%, not quite the 1.5% at YC, but still Ivy League level and easily on par with Stanford/Harvard.\n\n> Of course it does. Price is a function of supply and demand. Demand is increasing, which usually lowers the price. \n\nSeriously? Demand is increasing and that usually lowers the price??? Did you just really say that? Unless the supply is outpacing the demand, then you're very wrong! \n\n> so what do you think is causing the price to still go up \n\nThe same thing that's causing the salaries and the rent in the Bay Area to go up. There is a lot of competition in the space and it costs a lot more to run a startup. With $2M USD you will have a very hard time hiring 5 engineers, which cost an average of $200K each and still have money to acquire customers, keep an office space, pay your legal bills and so on... you will run out of money within 10 months. Why is an software engineer in the Bay Area making 2x what an software engineers in the mid-west are earning and 10x what a software engineer in Eastern Europe is earning? Why is rent 3x higher than in the mid-west and 10x higher than in Eastern Europe? Again, you're looking at very general statements and trying to draw conclusions.  \n\n**All you've said is that it costs more money to run a startup in the Bay Area. You have not actually shown that it's any easier to get that money.**  \n\n> Take what Sam said about the W15 batch companies. There were around 100 companies in that batch and in 5 months they raised $227M. You tell me who's right: your 35-40% of the companies raise after demo day, or that guy's 90-95% number? \n\nFrom those tweets, we gather that 114 YC W15 startups raised an average of 1.9M, whereas the average for a Boost startup is probably a quarter of that. Are most of the YC companies remaining in the Bay Area? If yes, then they'll need that 1.9M. Less than 30% of Boost companies remained in the US, so they can easily run with much less funding.  As a matter of fact, they can run with 1/5th of the funding that a Bay Area startup needs. With 100% Bitcon companies in Tribe 5 and most of the innovation needed **outside** of the US, this is no surprise. There are a large number of differences, which you are simply brushing over and generalizing. \n\n> Neither one makes Boost look good in comparison   \n\nBecause you're comparing apples and oranges, which was my reply right from the start.

Getting to the state of the art performance is more of a challenge, but again there there has been more competition in state of the art efficiency mining chip designs than CPUs.  It's not awesome, but on top of the baseline of centralization around state of the art fabs, it might be not far from the best that can be done right now.\n\nAlso, keep in mind the point I made in (3): For a compute bound part, the cost of the part is rapidly eclipsed by the energy costs. Because of this Bitcoin mining is the conversion of energy into proof; the ASIC is just a startup cost-- and even with an obscene markup, energy cost eclipses it. I think access to competitively priced energy is more equitable than access to state of the art semiconductor fabrication...\n\nMore problematic, in my opinion, than any of these access to mining issues is that mining that is _profitable_ but only pays small amounts is just not interesting to most people-- the fact that mining produces income distracts from its critical public-good role in securing the network. And, of course, if mining is fairly decentralized then each participant isn't going to get a ton of income all at once. I think we'd likely have a _more_ single-user-scale mining in absolute numbers of participants if mining was income-less (but almost certainly less practical security)-- though this is a guess. The aversion to small amounts of mining has been the case though all of bitcoin's life... I remember back in 2011 when GPU mining had taken off and CPU mining for me was only 2:1 return on electricity prices, people were yelling at others on the forum what morons they were for CPU mining at all because they'd only make a few dollars (e.g. a bitcoin) profit per week or two (Implicitly: macroscopic profit in fungible form is the only reason you'd mine ... imagine if all things you did had to return a monetary profit!).  (for one ... Reddit would only be shills. hm. waaait a minute. :P )\n\nRegardless, its still interesting to explore other ideas... even if I don't personally think they're cure-alls. :)\n\nAnd, yea, sure viable small scale nanofabrication might be a breakthrough for us (though, if it's costly per unit, perhaps not...); though it also would be for many other areas (particularly medical sensors).\n": 9, 'Well, "ASIC-resistant" is inherently impossible, but it\'s a buzzword for "you have the ASIC already" which indeed means the resources are also available to botnets.': 2, 'It doesn\'t need to be "easier".

You're either required to become a high powered industrial miner or an institutional investor.  The hobbyist or general human is excluded entirely.  You have teenage girls with laptops that own Dogecoins.  You won't see many of those, if any, in Bitcoin.\n\n3)  Since there is, in reality, not much if any reason for the public to switch from fiat to Bitcoin, the only possible way a widespread distribution would occur at all is from hobbyists using general purpose hardware.  It's kind of an ominus warning flag when you have Bitcoin devs themselves who can't buy ASICs without being scammed of 100btc.\n\n4)  The one plausible scenario Bitcoin would reach widespread distribution is due to full blown economic meltdown.

In addition, botnets are far less comfortable with computations that require GBytes of RAM, as they are very noticeable."\n\nSo, there may be an advantage, but it is far more limited than the advantage possessed by ASICs and botnets, currently.\n\ncc: u/luke-jr': 4, "(1) this is not an argument unless you can show that there is a type of memory that **exists** or **can exist** that has a negative impact on this solution.

Momentum is cited as prior work.': 2, '[My response was requested by Eragmus]\n\nI\'m happy to see more systematic work in this space, which is a big step up from the crazy stuff that has gone on around "memory hard" functions in the altcoin space... some of which have put out schemes which I was able to completely break in moments.\n\nI\'d previously communicated with one of the authors and made the point that hashcash functions must be cheap to verify to achieve their purpose.  I\'m glad to see more work on that.\n\nSpecific to the paper, I think This paper is pretty unfair wrt John Tromp\'s work-- they only cite and old version of his work, and it\'s much better and more complete and thoughtful than they\'re currently crediting it for.\n\nBeyond that I don\'t yet have much concrete to say about this paper-- though I do have some generalized complaints about the goal as applied to cryptocurrency consensus:\n\nIt is far from clear that "memory hardness" is actually a useful goal, even with the attacks (which many memory hard schemes have been _trivially_ vulnerable to) and progress problems removed.\n\nThe idea the memory hardness is desirable comes from the belief that dram already deployed is the optimal technology for these functions.  I think this simplistic logic may be wrong, especially for the consensus-POW application, due to several reasons:\n\n(1) There are many other kinds of memory technology in use, imagined, and yet to be invented. In particular, combined computation and ram in a single part, and 3d technologies (e.g. through silicon vias), or [other approaches](http://newsroom.intel.com/community/intel_newsroom/blog/2015/07/28/intel-and-micron-produce-breakthrough-memory-technology), may still radically shift the trade-off towards specialized hardware. I believe the probability of this happening is much greater then further radical speedups of plain computational logic (like sha256) because the latter is so much more mature. Mover over, the higher NRE costs to deploy advanced technology mean that a production monopoly is more likely if specialized hardware is created.\n\n(2) Mining income depends on marginal advantage.  Even if a memory hard scheme completely delivers on its hope of a reduced gap between specialized hardware and general purpose computers; specialized mining hardware will be still less costly and more energy efficient, if nothing else because it eliminated superfluous peripherals.  Mining seeks an average break even equilibrium, so once lower cost devices are widely deployed, general purpose devices will operate at a loss and tend to be pushed out of operation. ... even if the advantage was _only_ a small factor.\n\n(3) Typical compute bound hardware on modern semiconductor process will easily consume its manufacturing cost in energy after only a few weeks of operation (e.g. for budget GPUs sold at retail run full tilt its not uncommon for power to match purchase in ~8 weeks).   So compute bound POW is really converting energy to proof -- that some chip is involved is largely incidental.    A memory bound function moves more of the total cost of a computation into upfront fabrication costs.  Access to fabrication is far more monopolized than access to energy, and funds spent on fabrication are amortized across the life of the hardware effectively creating a first mover advantage.\n\n(2) is an issue specific to mining, and I think it\'s pretty significant.  (3) might be less of a problem for mining than for other memory hard applications but I think diminishes the expected gains. (1) is a wildcard, but really is just an argument that compute bound functions are more conservative.\n\nMuch of this is also covered in https://download.wpsoftware.net/bitcoin/asic-faq.pdf\n\nMore generally, we can look to the centralization that seems to be ongoing in ethereum as evidence that having a memory hard function does not necessary have the advertised advantages for mining in practice; even if we ignore litecoin\'s similar failure (because it wasn\'t memory hard enough).\n\nThat said, I think it\'s useful to have more mature well analyzed tools in the toolbox that we can pull out and apply as needed.  I\'m interested in using a function of this class (though I think my preference is still Tromp\'s work) for some anti-DOS attack hashcash in Bitcoin applications... especially because these applications are a safer way to try out new technology than consensus systems.\n': 20, 'For (1) I think you misunderstand the normal burden of proof for security arguments. I am arguing our state of maturity for extracting the most out of boring computational functions is substantially higher than attacking memory hard POW; thus computational hardness is somewhat more conservative (or at least much better understood!). I don\'t believe this is too controversial. (This is further backed by the multitude memory hard pow schemes that have failed to deliver on their promise even absent major hardware advances.)\n\nOn (2) see (3), the cost of the ASIC hardware is already small compared to the energy. You can also mine bitcoin with hardware you already have, but just at a loss relative to energy costs. (2) argues that even with memory hard functions mining on standard hardware will end up being a loss (if a smaller one), and "More problematic", in my response argues that even if it isn\'t a loss, most people are (apparently) actively disinterested in small scale mining.\n\nSee also: The failure to achieve the CPU only goal for the first widespread CPU only cryptocurrency.': 1, 'Thanks, Greg.': 3, "> hashcash functions must be cheap to verify to achieve their purpose.\n\nAnd thus memory hardness can only be achieved by going beyond\nthe hashcash proof of work, as I wrote about in\n\nhttp://cryptorials.io/beyond-hashcash-proof-work-theres-mining-hashing\n\nThe desirability of a memory hard PoW for a high market cap crypto currency is an open question with no easy answers and one that deserves more study.\n\nI think it could be desirable if it can radically change the economics of mining,\nto the point where mining is profitable for no one. That means that even the\n(hypothetically) most energy-efficient ASIC with custom memory technology,\nwould still not have a positive ROI, due to the following reasons:\n\n(1) fabrication costs are going to be much larger than for whatever memory technology is used for commodity computing devices, which still enjoy much larger economies of scale.\n\n(2) electricity costs, while lower than for commodity memory, are unlikely to\nto be more than an order of magnitude lower.\n\nand the main reason:\n\n(3) huge numbers of people could be willing to mine at a loss, just as they are happy to play the lottery. this requires a very low barrier to entry, like one click\nto install a mining app on your phone that will make it mine overnight while charging.\nit helps to know that your mining efficiency is not more than (roughly) an order of magnitude worse than with custom hardware.\n\nOf course I'm not claiming this is a likely scenario, but I think it's at least imaginable...\n\nAnother possibility to consider is having 2 PoWs: one compute bound, and one memory bound, splitting the blocks between them. Mining the compute bound one would be (barely) profitable with ASICs, while the mining the memory bound one would be unprofitable, but help decentralization.\n\nStill, unprofitable mining is by no means a requirement for making memory hard PoWs desirable.\n\nIt is conceivable that any memory technology developed to make the PoW's memory accesses as energy efficient as possible, \nwill benefit many other classes of computation especially in mobile, solar powered, and other low-powered settings, as thus inevitably lead to commoditization.\n\nThis argument works best for PoWs that do as little\ncomputation as possible apart from memory accesses,\nand I believe this is where Cuckoo Cycle's edge trimming shines.": 3, 'That different miners don\'t mine the same sequences so that the more powerful miner doesn\'t always win.

This will be good for the over-all re-decentralization of Bitcoin.

Basically slamming servers in a way that dramatically slows them down (or renders them useless for most people), which at the same time is attempting to get into people's accounts.  Cloudflare _TREMENDOUSLY_ helps with this one.  \n  \n2) Heavy traffic DDoS used to mask other attempts at getting into a server.  Basically filling any security logs will huge amounts of garbage to hide the actual attempts.\n\n3) MASSIVE traffic DDoS designed to take a site completely offline.

': 1, 'I found this in the comment section of that link:\n\nFrom: Alan Graham\n\n\n"Co-founder of one of the projects mentioned here, OCL\xe2\x80\xa6a bit more about what it actually is and how it came to be.\n\nWe began 2 years ago with a simple premise to solve the issues surrounding copyright and user-generated content. I was tired of seeing takedowns and all the fighting. I wanted platforms to be free of takedowns, citizens to not worry about \xe2\x80\x9ccan they,\xe2\x80\x9d and artists and rights owners to get paid (every time). We worked from the bottom up with artists, indies, their trade organizations, unions, managers, etc. showing them what we were building and getting their support. From that we built something that gives everyone form all sides\xe2\x80\xa6what they want.\n\nOur first front facing bit of kit can deliver any media to any user through any app, natively with all the rights cleared so users can create/remix all the UGC works they like with no concerns over takedowns, copyright infringement, etc. We do this with a multi-repertoire approach that means you can clear disparate assets across different owners (a song and a video and some images all mashed together). Rights owners and artists can let their works go safely, while ensuring there is a micropayment for every single use of media. Artists get paid for every single use. And zero DRM. We\xe2\x80\x99re even compatible with Creative Commons with auto attribution and a notification engine that tells you when your works are used and where.\n\nWith a singular API, apps can add catalogues of videos, music, images, text (and more) directly into their app with no issues over rights or how to source content. All of the rights cleared, no complicated deals. Our APIs also make it possible for apps to be able to integrate cloud based music services so that music from streaming sources can be embedded directly into any creation, and monetize that as well. Users of apps are going to see functionality and freedom that\xe2\x80\x99s never been seen before\xe2\x80\xa6and no more complexity over copyright. As we say\xe2\x80\xa6we make copyright compatible.\n\nAnother API allows users to legally pull assets out of digital creations (i.e. pull a photo out of a video) and reuse/remix them (from the original source materials). No copy/paste\xe2\x80\xa6no need to download or take something without permission. We make it easy to freely grab creative works with a single tap\xe2\x80\xa6even from the web. So go ahead and mash it up\xe2\x80\xa6we can unmash it and you can mash it again.\n\nBut that just scratches the surface. Our back end technologies harness (as mentioned) centralized and decentralized tech to provide a suite of services and capabilities that no artist has ever seen before. We utilize a combination of distributed revision control and the blockchain to register ownership of works, determine usage/terms/rates, and you can then use the blockchain to audit us, or use us to audit the blockchain (or audit anyone else). We\xe2\x80\x99re designed to be a bridge between legacy systems and the future, as we can also work with any PRO (and are current working with some).\n\nOur technology is capable of introducing scarcity (limited editions), where you can actually have 1 of say 100k works\xe2\x80\xa6whether you prefer streaming or actual files (and that\xe2\x80\x99s just the beginning). We also ensure that regardless of what type of rights owner you happen to be, you are in control of your terms and rates and you get paid for each and every use. We\xe2\x80\x99ve even demystified blockchain and crypto currencies for users and rights owners. All of this technology and more is running today.\n\nWe\xe2\x80\x99re building a technical suite of solutions for creative people, both professionals and amateurs\xe2\x80\xa6removing the frictions between everyone surrounding issues of copyright and unlocking new possibilities no one has ever seen before.\n\nAnd did I mention\xe2\x80\xa6every use of media can be paid for\xe2\x80\xa6and every payment is accounted for and can go directly to who owns it. The possibilities of what this could do is only limited by imagination.\n\nhttp://n2one.us\n\nWe are currently working with partners on a public beta for 2015. If you want to know more, drop us a line."\n': 9, "Not really. I've bought a few CDs from bands on Bandcamp even though I can probably download their stuff for free.

If he really thinks that someone wont be able to rip a 'copyright protected' song from their service and then throw it up on a webhost, torrent, usenet, whatever.....then he clearly has no clue what he's talking about and should not be using any of the terminology he is, because I doubt he understands even a smidge of the own words he's saying.\n\nThey absolutely will *not* be able to release a piece of their copyright work safely without someone ripping it and sharing it. There is no discussion here, there is simply too many ways to skin a cat when it comes to piracy and this will not stop it at all. What it will help them with is direct distribution of funds for all the content that is paid for. \n\nThats it.": 4, 'so this is the gist then...\n\n>You can examine the policies associated with the track, see how payments are automatically distributed to the different contributors to the song and \xe2\x80\x93 if you have the cryptocurrency Ether \xe2\x80\x93 buy a download of the song and have your transaction recorded permanently on the blockchain.\n\nThis introduces smart contracts to distribute funds to song contributors...\n\n>Anybody can use the registered content provided that they meet the terms of the policy. The right to do so is transferred automatically through a smart contract.': 6, "How will she be using the blockchain? The article wasn't clear.": 10, 'Since I\'m the person mentioned here I should explain and reply. I\'ve worked in tech for over 20 years and written about it for over a decade. I\'ve been through the issues surrounding piracy and as an author for O\'Reilly I\'ve even taken the RIAA and others to task for their heavy handed and closed minded tactics in the past. I believe strongly in creative freedom, remix culture, and transformative use, but I also believe artists should be paid...even if that payment is a micropayment, they deserve that. Fair use doesn\'t necessarily mean free use.   \n\nWhen we started building out our technology, we wanted to take an approach that was also 50% methodology (too many people focus solely on tech)...we wanted to make sure we weren\'t locking things down, but instead freeing them...allowing people to do what they are already doing, by bringing them everything they want directly to their fingertips and allowing them to mix, remix, mashup to their hearts content. We don\'t worry about DRM because you can\'t stop those who ultimately don\'t want to pay for things. Our belief was that if you want to steal, you will steal. What we did instead was build out a technology and structure that basically says if you pay for things, we\'ll give you more and more value for supporting those artists and rights owners. But we also make getting things stupidly easy...it is worth paying for the convenience...one tap and everything you want loads up where you want it. \n\n>I think there\'s some confusion here. If he really thinks that someone wont be >able to rip a \'copyright protected\' song from their service and then throw it up >on a webhost, torrent, usenet, whatever.....then he clearly has no clue what >he\'s talking about and should not be using any of the terminology he is, >because I doubt he understands even a smidge of the own words he\'s saying.\n\nI understand more than a smidge, and I don\'t believe that...I believe it is a waste of time to worry about it. Instead, do something better. We\'re not worried about you ripping something from a service...we\'re going to give it to you direct from that service. Ripping is time consuming. How about we just deliver it direct to you from that service? \n\nSo OCL is a non-profit/for-profit entity where the core technology that makes all this possible is put into the NFP so that artists finally have a technology platform of their own. They will own their own technology, and not simply be at the mercy of gatekeepers. It gives them a sense of control over their destiny and it allows any app or platform on the planet (particularly startups) to get access to catalogue that normally would take years to gain access to and usually require a large check paid in advance...we make all that go away with a single SDK. Do in days what is now actually impossible. \n\nFor citizens who want to make things, we\'ve got a process that auto-clears all the rights in advance so you can make anything you like. No takedowns, no bullshit, no heavy handed tactics. We take all the incompatible and complex issues of copyright and make them go away. And we\'re doing for your own creations what we do for others...because all of us are creators in this age and your creations have value. \n\nYou want STEM/MIDI files for a remix...done. You want to make cat videos with popular music and clips from Getty...done. You want to use creative commons images or video with copyrighted music...done...and with auto-attribution. You want to monetize or commercialize your new creations...those options are available as well.  \n\nAs for the issues of scarcity and how we make that possible without DRM...it simply has to do with thinking beyond the old ideas of ripping...if an artist wants to release a limited edition digital copy of an album they can...but it really has very little to do with the music but the world in which the album will open to the fan. I can\'t really say much more about most of this because of current IP and some strategic planning...but you\'ll see it soon enough. We showed this off at the Imogen event. \n\nBut I\'ll close with this. Two years ago I was struck with this idea born out of the constant bullshit fighting between creative and tech...10 years on and still no solutions, just arguments. We needed to move on and to do that we needed something that took a look at the current landscape and leapt over it...that said we\'re stuck in the wrong methodology of how we think about dealing with rights and digital assets in this age. We\'re so concerned with locking things down that if we instead took the approach of unlocking it but ensuring everyone got what they wanted...everyone would be happy. So we spent a year and a half talking with all types of artists and rights owners (OCL is multi-repertoire, not simply music) to design something for the future before writing a single line of code.  \n\n>I have the same question: How can DRM be avoided in the above scenario?\n\nDRM and locking down digital assets is not only pretty much impossible, it puts rights owners and rights users at odds against each other as adversaries. This is an ingrained mentality that makes actual progress impossible. My view has always been that stealing only gets you the initial satisfaction/instant gratification. But when you spend money...it will unlock new worlds that have never been available before. Every single penny you spend also builds a direct/closer bond between you and the artist you support. \n\nAnd yes...we use blockchain technology, but we\'re not a "me too" approach that many have been taking. We had already built the core redundancies of our own platform before we tackled blockchain because what if it isn\'t the next big thing? So we\'re blockchain agnostic, you could say. What we\'ve used blockchain and the ideas behind bitcoin for I can\'t fully talk about yet (you\'ll like it), but I will say this. Since I first envisioned this solution, I was adamant about one thing...we will not know who you are or track you as is the monetization model of most platforms today. We\'re removing the idea of platforms holding your persona...your identity...the ideas behind usernames and passwords...of holding personal data in the cloud to be hacked and used against you. Nope...will not have any part in that...won\'t store any financial data, and we won\'t use people as guinea pigs to test ad delivery systems against. We\'re not ad supported and we think what we\'re building is too important to put your personal identity and safety at risk. And frankly...when I got involved in the Internet in the early 90\'s...this wasn\'t the web I signed up for. I think people are ready for something better and better is what we want to build.    \n': 3, 'Nope. ': 1, 'Buzzwords buzzes near buzz-like thingy.': 2, "Its not a marketing gimmick.

It relies on a misunderstanding of what a pool actually does. (See socrates1024 - Miller\'s post).\n\n(Edit: It\'s also very possible, though not proven that Satoshi was using a farm as the very first miner in exactly the configuration he describes... this is based on some other work that I would have to dig up somewhere.)': 4, "I don't think Satoshi foresaw the pooled mining protocol. Nothing the author cited addresses this. \n\nAlso, when Satoshi says minority forks are dangerous, it doesn't seem plausible that this involves merge mining.

The innovation occurred when someone (slush? ribuck?) figured out how to make it happen by using lower difficult PoW/shares to make it distribute proportionally. This kind of decoupled the node from the hash rate in a way that Satoshi\'s description lacks.\n\nLet me be clear, I don\'t mean to say that Satoshi didn\'t know pools were going to happen, I\'m just pointing out that a reasonable person can believe that he didn\'t anticipate it based on the data presented. aquentin\'s info in reply to socrates1024 is suggestive way more than the quotes you\'ve made, but they were made after the core innovation was presented by somebody else.': 1, 'I love when blog posts trying to correct misinformation also spread misinformation.\n\n* Satoshi never deployed SPV clients.\n* Of course he foresaw the development of ASICs. He is in threads talking about GPUs. Anyone who knows anything about computer hardware knows that FPGAs and eventually ASICs would be used.\n* Many of those quotes have very little to do with mining pools. If you look back in the history of this the first mining pool (created by /u/Slush0) happened shortly after Satoshi left. The code/infrastructure to develop a "fair" mining pool is fairly non-obvious, so it\'s certainly possible that Satoshi didn\'t forsee mining **pools** forming (contrast to what he means by farms).\n\nI\'d also think it would be fair to say that the development happened much quicker than Satoshi wanted or expected. He asked the first GPU miners to cool it and he tried to stop people from funding Wikileaks.\n\nEdit: You could ask Slush what he thinks about the state of the art when he made the mining pool. He could be able to put some of this to rest.': 12, "When was this? Post early 2011? Are you referring to the Dorian thing?
