But conspicuously absent from that report is any mention of the number of national security requests it received.\n\nIn Reddit\xe2\x80\x99s transparency report for 2014, it indicated in a section titled \xe2\x80\x9cnational security requests\xe2\x80\x9d that it had received no National Security Letter during that year, or any order issued by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs of January 29, 2015, reddit has never received a National Security Letter, an order under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or any other classified request for user information.\xe2\x80\x9d The company also noted in the last sentence of that section, \xe2\x80\x9cIf we ever receive such a request, we would seek to let the public know it existed.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nNow, in Reddit\xe2\x80\x99s transparency report for 2015, that entire section is missing.\n\nHow NSLs Work\nNational security letters are written demands from the FBI that compel internet service providers, credit companies, financial institutions, and others to hand over confidential records about their customers, such as subscriber information, phone numbers, e-mail addresses, websites visited, and more. NSLs have been used since the 1980s, but the Patriot Act expanded the kinds of records that could be obtained with them. They do not require court approval, and, most importantly, they come with a built-in gag order that prevents the recipient from disclosing that they have received an order. This makes the government\xe2\x80\x99s use of them ripe for abuse; and indeed DoJ inspector general reports have uncovered abuses of the FBI\xe2\x80\x99s NSL authority.\n\nThe letters are one of the FBI\xe2\x80\x99s most powerful tools; but there is little oversight of them and they are rarely discussed inside or outside Congress. The public has become aware of only a handful of some 300,000 NSLs handed out over the last decade, and those became public only after the recipients launched legal battles opposing them. Although recipients of an NSL can challenge them in court, few companies that received one have done so.\n\nIn the face of gag orders, many companies have devised a method, called a \xe2\x80\x9cwarrant canary,\xe2\x80\x9d to notify the public that they\xe2\x80\x99ve received an NSL or FISA Court order without actually stating so\xe2\x80\x94they do this by including a statement in their annual transparency report that asserts they have not received any such order for that year. As long as that \xe2\x80\x9ccanary\xe2\x80\x9d keeps singing, meaning that it keeps appearing in a company\xe2\x80\x99s annual transparency report, the public can safely assume this to be true. But once the \xe2\x80\x9ccanary\xe2\x80\x9d falls silent in a transparency report, it\xe2\x80\x99s a sign that the government likely served the company with a national security order during the period since their last transparency report.\n\nAlthough gag orders can prohibit the company from saying in the positive that they received an NSL, the government can\xe2\x80\x99t force a company to lie, says Kurt Opsahl, deputy executive director and general counsel of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, which the company would be doing if it continued to publish a statement in reports saying it hasn\xe2\x80\x99t received an NSL when in fact it has received one. The concept of warrant canaries hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been fully tested in court, however, and companies could find themselves in trouble if the government decided to challenge them. Reddit is the first company Opsahl is aware of that has \xe2\x80\x9ckilled\xe2\x80\x9d its canary, if that indeed turns out to be the case. But he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t think Reddit is on shaky ground if it did indeed tell the public, in killing its canary, that it received a national security letter.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe question is whether the government could require you to continue to [state you haven\xe2\x80\x99t received an NSL] when that\xe2\x80\x99s not true,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cI would certainly argue that they cannot compel someone to lie.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAs for whether the government could go after Reddit for violating the spirit of the law?\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t get thrown in jail for violating the spirit of the law,\xe2\x80\x9d says Kevin Bankston, director of New America\xe2\x80\x99s Open Technology Institute.\n\nCompanies Push Back\xe2\x80\x94Or Try To\nReddit didn\xe2\x80\x99t respond to WIRED\xe2\x80\x99s request for comment. But in a discussion thread on the site today, Reddit CEO Steve Huffman, who uses the Reddit handle \xe2\x80\x9cspez,\xe2\x80\x9d discussed the issue of the warrant canary and the difficulty of not being able to confirm or deny whether the company had received a national security letter.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cEven with the canaries, we\xe2\x80\x99re treading a fine line,\xe2\x80\x9d he wrote. \xe2\x80\x9cThe whole thing is icky, which is why we joined Twitter in pushing back. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been advised not to say anything one way or the other.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHis reference to Twitter is about an amicus brief that Reddit filed earlier this month, along with several other tech companies, in support of Twitter.\n\nIn that case, Twitter is asking the government for permission to publish a transparency report disclosing the number of requests for data that it received from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court between July 1, 2013 and December 31, 2013. \xe2\x80\x9cTwitter does not wish to reveal detail about any specific order that it may have received from the FISC during that time period, but rather seeks to publish the actual aggregate number of [Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA)] orders received,\xe2\x80\x9d the amicus brief states. Twitter also wants the freedom to report that \xe2\x80\x9cit received \xe2\x80\x98zero\xe2\x80\x99 FISA orders, or \xe2\x80\x98zero\xe2\x80\x99 of a specific kind of FISA order, for that period, if either of these circumstances is true.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTwitter, and the signatories to the amicus brief, assert that the gag orders that come with national security orders violate the First Amendment \xe2\x80\x9cand to the extent the government relies on those provisions to prohibit Twitter indefinitely from publishing information about FISA orders it receives, those provisions are unconstitutional as applied.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThey\xe2\x80\x99re not the only ones who think so.\n\nIn 2013, a California district court judge ruled that NSL gag orders are an unconstitutional impingement on free speech, after one recipient of an NSL challenged it. US District Judge Susan Illston found that although the government made a strong argument for prohibiting the recipients of NSLs from disclosing to the target of an investigation or the public the specific information being sought under an NSL, the government did not provide compelling argument that the mere fact of disclosing that an NSL was received harmed national security interests.\n\nA blanket prohibition on disclosure, she found, was overly broad and \xe2\x80\x9ccreates too large a danger that speech is being unnecessarily restricted.\xe2\x80\x9d Illston ordered the government to stop issuing NSLs across the board and also ordered the government to cease enforcing the gag provision in other cases where they may already have been issued. However, the government appealed to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, which vacated her ruling and sent the case back to the district court last year. The case is pending further proceedings.\n\nIn their amicus brief in the Twitter case, Reddit and its co-signers urged the court to find that service providers have a constitutional right to report data about national security requests.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis question is crucial for all companies seeking to provide accurate, useful information to their users in the aftermath of momentous public disclosures about government surveillance that have undermined user trust in online services,\xe2\x80\x9d they wrote.\n\nAs the recent Apple-FBI case over the San Bernardino iPhone has shown, sunlight and transparency help produce a healthy and vigorous public debate about government surveillance activities that have long been in the dark.\n': 2, 'They are finally crosschecking IPs of deleted comments with gox and silk road accounts.?

I\'ll give likely a terrible description of what I thought I remembered reading a long time ago...\n\nEach transaction is recorded to a block, & each block is resolved approx every 10 minutes.  The last bit of information on one block links to the first bit of info on the new one.  After X number of blocks, the oldest blocks are reduced to just that little bit of information that linked them to other blocks.  After Y number more blocks, the bunch of "tags" from the reduced blocks become one "tag" at the end.\n\nIf this is the case, I wonder if it\'s not dictated by the number of blocks, but by the oldest stationary funds.  If Satoshi\'s bitcoins are never moved, maybe it never gets abbreviated?  If it has nothing to do with the oldest sitting funds, and there is a chain abbreviation, would that "tag" information be enough to establish ownership of those very old, unmoved, bitcoins?  Maybe there are some privacy advantages once the abbreviation begins?\n\nIf I\'m even close to right with my description, and this is a thing..  I am wondering if X amount of blocks have come & gone, and so there are now block "tags" in the chain, rather than entire blocks.  If so, have Y blocks happened, and many tags been reduced to one?  Also, if this type of strategy works, I wonder what would happen if the X, & Y, were adjusted, to give a >64gb, or >128gb, max blockchain size.\n\nIf we currently have 7 years of every single transaction, and there has been no abbreviation, will X come in 7 more?  It\'s not the size of the blocks that matter, right, but the amount of them?  So it should be a set amount of time.  If this is ever to happen, we can say that it\'s more secure to have >X full blocks in the chain, but then what is the right amount of blocks?  I\'m not suggesting bringing it down to 6 months.  I am not really suggesting anything.  Just curious about how it works.  Maybe it\'s currently set to be 150 years, so as to include every possible transaction of every living person?  I imagine that\'s not feasible.\n\nI just discovered last night that the blockchain has exceeded 64gb already.  It seems like it would be nice if we could cap that at 64gb, 128gb, or 256gb, just so that we aren\'t constantly having to upgrade the storage of our nodes.

If the propagation improvements the relay network offers were taken into account for their calculations, they would have arrived at a much larger block size than 4MB.  The relay network though, unlike thin blocks, help only miners and not nodes with propagation.\n\nThin blocks, while not as good as the relay network, are a protocol improvement.  Every miner and every node can use it, unlike the relay network.  It offers on average ~13X speedup of block propagation, and in conjunction with the libsecp256k1 verification and getblocktemplate speedups in core 0.12 (which the authors were not using) make blocks much larger than the 4MB concluded here possible at a protocol level.  These are technologies available today.\n\nShould note - thin blocks offer even better propagation speedups when mempools are better synced across the network.  If blocks were larger, nodes wouldn't need to be dropping mempool transactions and thus would be better synced with other mempools, and propagation speeds would improve even more with thin blocks.": 20, "> But if block sizes are so huge that I can't even process the blockchain without a 10-machine cluster in a remote datacenter, guess what?

With thinblocks deployed block sizes don't really matter that much as most nodes would have a majority (95%+) of the transaction already in their mempool. Not transmitting the whole blocks would make it way more easy to stay within 12 seconds (and thus the block size can be significantly raised).

Can also transfer to email address, but have not tried this yet\n\n- works great with the debit card.

Code arrived super fast\n\n": 3, 'Does it work in the US?': 1, 'I have problems with web and Android as well. BTC account is there on mobile but no cards. Balance is zero.
