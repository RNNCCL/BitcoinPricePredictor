You can kind of already do it if you can get an xpub from your Trezor from elsewhere (we recently added xpub support).\n\nThis seems like a nice feature but it should be made clear that this doesn't offer the same security level as using your Trazor normally. Someone who steals my phone with greenaddress app and my 2FA + beats me to steal my pin code, can still access the funds without the Trezor. That is why the Trezor also need to be used for 2FA (preferably the only activated 2FA option)\n\n> As to using Trezor or other hardware wallet as 2FA is certainly an option, although we also have velocity limit that allow to you to bypass 2FA for some day to day cases and seems easier than handling 2FA on a Trezor which could be used for signing transactions instead.\nReusing the same Trezor for signing and 2FA is probably not adding extra security. Using two different ones can improve security but I think it may be even better to use two devices from two different manufacturers to make it more secure.\n\nIf Trezor can be used in the 2of3 model, and as 2FA, the following will be possible. Imagine an account with 10 BTC. If the Trezor is plugged in, it can be used to sign the transaction and use the seed stored in the browser to sing, eleminating greenaddress signing (full control of my funds). But if I want to make 1BTC available for daily use. I use the Trezor as 2FA to set the velocity limit. Now this 1BTC is available to me simply trough my browser/phone using my PIN.\n\nThis also make a lot of sense because when I need to do a big transaction. I want to utilize the power of the Trezot (and it's screen) to verify it myself before signing. Eliminating any possible attack vector their is on greenaddress on a compromised machine. \n\nIf you want to enable even more hardware wallets, you can just add them as 2FA options and require to authenticate using two different 2FA methods. This also really shows the power of multisig and greenaddress as a gateway for the final signature. This also might be the easiest way to implement new wallets fast.\n": 1, "Logging into your BitGo account by itself does not download your key. The client is not allowed to even download your encrypted user key without you passing an additional 2FA step. In order to transact, you then enter your wallet passcode which decrypts your key in the browser and allows the client to half-sign a transaction, after which the client dumps the key.\n\nWe'll be looking at how to integrate BitGo with hardware key options in the coming months.": 0, "To my understanding your implementation works as follows. Once a transaction is created. Instead of decrypting the Mnemonic from local browser storage using correct bin and retrieving the password. The transaction is first send to trezor to sign. Once this is done it is send to greenaddress for the second signature and to be broadcasted. \n\nIt their a way to send coins when no Trezor is connected? I guess not because all transaction need to be signed by the Trezor to work.\n\nThe ideal solution to me would be to be able to setup a *Trezor account* under the *Accounts* option in settings. This would also enable Trezor as a 2FA option for the other account. Greenaddress could simply ask for a random message to be signed from the tresor. If this corresponds with the xpub on file, 2FA will pass.\n\nIn this scenario greenaddress is the one stop solution. I can login to my account using simple pin on authenticated devices. I have access to my full secure savings, generating addresses for the trezor account, protected by the hardware if I need to send from it. (even in the future maybe delayed transaction signing by greenaddress for extra security). \n\nThe normal accounts can still be use for the 'daily' spending and convenience. Trezor and other 2FA methods can be used to set the *spending limits* on your daily wallet for super easy access and speed when dealing with small amounts.\n\n**TLDR**; Trezor as a separate account and as 2FA would make greenaddress the one top go solution.\n\nPS: Sorry for the wall of text :P ": 1, "For desktop yes (chrome app or browser via plugin/brdige), for mobile it is still in [beta](http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/2qux23/greenbits_early_preview_new_simple_yet_powerful/) and the current version out has some issues (which we have fixed and should be out in the next couple of days).\n\nThe documentation/tutorial is not yet available but there are some basic instructions.\n\nMore information here: http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/2qj5wd/the_latest_trezor_commit_is_titled_prepare_130/cn6nwc1\n\nNote: this is not a mytrezor replacement, you can't access the same wallet you see in mytrezor, it's multisignature only (2of2 or 2of3 and soon more)": 4, 'The Bitcoin tip for 1 ranch sauce (1,532 bits/CA$0.50) has been collected by *slush0*.\n\n\n[ChangeTip info](https://www.changetip.com/tip-online/reddit) | [ChangeTip video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AnfKpypMNw) | /r/Bitcoin': 1, "When I hear how Andreas uses a separate computer that's never been connected to the internet to sign transactions, it makes me think the ideal situation is to never have keys on my computer even if it's in a special encrypted browser application for just an instant.\n\nThis is why I still recommend Circle to my friends, because I research bitcoin all the time and I still don't understand bitcoin security.

The nice thing about them is, signing parties keep their secrets to themselves, which can help with getting rid of some central points of vulnerability.\n\nBitstamp switched all their deposit addresses to multi-sig, which presumably means that they authenticate transactions through two completely independent entities. This would allow sanity checks to be performed by a secondary authority, and make it impossible for the "hot wallet" to be stolen (e.g. you\'d have to steal two wallets from two locations). Given the privacy issues, I\'m guessing the sanity checks would have to be rudimentary.\n\nIf properly implemented (I have no reason to suspect the contrary), this will especially help against some physical attacks (e.g. employee running away with the wallet). However it\'s important to keep in mind that there are all sorts of other things that can go wrong and there is no magic bullet for security.\n\nI\'d recommend waiting for them to publish audits if you have doubts.

With multi-sig, you need multiple keys, multiple people, or even multiple institutions to sign a blockchain transaction.\n\nBitstamp replaced their hot wallet with a BitGo Platform API integration. Now BitGo holds a key, Bitstamp holds a key, and there is a third key offline for disaster recovery. Every transaction is signed by Bitstamp and then co-signed by BitGo once a set of fraud detection and business rules are checked. If there is ever an attack that compromises Bitstamp, BitGo will stop co-signing, thwarting the attack.\n\nMulti-sig is without a doubt a better security model than single-key cold storage + single key hot wallet -- the predominant model in past years -- we are thrilled to see Bitstamp lead the way in adopting this important technology.": 2, "Well even if they won't lose any more btc now.

Both of those address have illegal characters.\n\nSecond of all, the last few characters of the address are a checksum. Change or add or remove any random character and the chances of the resulting sequence of characters being a valid address is a few *billion* to one against.\n\nFinding just a few characters to change near the middle (and good luck finding two characters in base58 that look similar in any widely used font like Helvetica, Comic Sans, Arial, Times New Roman, etc) but keeping the first 5 and last 4 characters the same while maintaining a valid checksum is a Herculean task. And actually owning the private key whose matching public key is hashed into that address is even less likely. Here\'s why: to get a similar looking address that isn\'t just a black hole, you need to base58 encode the hash (SHA256 and RIPEMD160) and checksum of a public key... which is formed by applying elliptic curve cryptography math on a private key the malicious actor came up with. The required computing power to reliably pull off such a stunt more than once every few billion years doesn\'t exist. Even if the bad guy wants to make a black hole address because he gets off on people losing money without profiting himself, it would still be extremely unlikely to find a valid address (keeping in mind clients won\'t even allow a send to an invalid address) with very few changes that still "looks" the same.\n\nTL;DR: This is not a problem.': 3, 'I like your idea with the color swatches.  \nThat being said, I have made many, many bitcoin transactions and have never typed in the address.

Just a visual hint.\n\nAnd as for the slight color differences in the algorithm I proposed I'm hashing the address once again, so that even small alterations should result in very different combinations colors (we're not comparing single colors only).\n\nBut of course I agree, that it is way more easier for anybody to generate two similarly-looking swatches than two similarly-looking addresses or even decrypt the private key.\n\nThe idea was just to make the process of comparing and distinguishing  addresses a little bit quicker and easier (even if not 100% secure and bullet proof) - just as a secondary reinforcement of the validity of the address.\n\nBtw. you're mentioning other approaches of making the UX of the bitcoin transactions better (?). I'd love read more about them! Can you share some links, please?\n\nThanks again for all your comments to this idea. I got to know something more. :)": 2, "Your example is a bit contrived, and I'll have to give counter-examples for your suggestion.\n\nTo get the first one out of the way - you have one address in which you changed a 1 (one) to an I (uppercase letter i).  Those are not allowed in addresses to begin with, but more importantly: even if you had changed it to one that does look similar, is valid, and to which you have the private key, you would have spent a fair bit of time generating it.  \n( TheHelpfulGuy also touched on this. )\n\nThe second bit relates to the fact that you're encoding the addresses as colors as some sort of check.  That's fine, but you already noticed that color blind people will have issues.  But you really don't need to be color blind.  How many people are going to see the difference between e.g. bdff00 and d4ff00 colors, especially if they do not have an exact reference? (if they have an exact reference, odds are they would have an exact address to begin with).  \n\nAs an example, try this address: 12VrBiLJ7iuRWzMcB3ha4TU2rvzM2yiGj4  \nThere's still 4 swatches, but how many people can clearly see the difference between the left and right half?\n\nGiven that most would not easily see the difference, that opens it up to targeting by merely generating addresses that look 'close enough'.  \n\nCompare, for example, your 18D5tD7y10zwjHvY7JTYnbcCIjnzKWEg5VZ to 1HN66o8m9U3RJhTXUG8geDzRDzKq8aoU9y .  Sure, swatch #3 is decidedly more orange.. and swatch 1 is more pinkish than purple but keep in mind I only found this one by entering some random addresses off of the latest block's transactions.  A targeted attack could easily generate thousands of addresses which, when using your scheme, will look close enough - or even be exact matches.\n\nI do think it's a semi-novel approach, but as with so many of these approaches, they should be combined with other approaches, or else it can instill a false sense of security.": 2}, ('How can we still spend our coins if myTrezor.com is compromised?', 11): {'excellent, thanks': 1, "What's the tldr on electum": 2, 'GreenAddress.it also works with Trezor.

He had a tendency to create great things, but when people started using his innovations he usually tried to avoid the spotlight and start working on the next project. This is where the mystery comes in. He doesn't reveal his ideas until they are tested and known to work. Secrecy is his top priority. What baffles everyone is how much thought he puts into his creations...almost to the point that Satoshi is not just one man.  It's been rumored that Satoshi is a secret group similar to early samurai. This rumor has been backed up by highly regarded individuals such as Andreas Antonopoulos, who is the secret societies spokesman. He gives some of the best insight to bitcoin and makes complex ideas palatable.  When people attempt to question Andreas, he is quick to dodge inquires about Satoshi.  This leaves a pressing question; what is Satoshis' next focus? The spread of bitcoin? How to allow renewable oxygen on mars? The krabby patty formula? The world may never know...\n\nEdit: Whoa! Thank you for gold! :O": 5, 'As he squinted at the screen on bitcoinwisdom.com, Satoshi Nakamoto suddenly felt a surge of pride and a smug satisfaction that the price of a bitcoin had crossed the 1000 dollar threshold.\n\nHe sat back in his chair with a sigh.\n\nWith his 1.5 million bitcoins he was certainly the richest, if not only, bitcoin billionaire.\n\nTruthfully, a certain amount of greed welled up within him and he briefly considered not selling any bitcoin because he knew that inevitably the price would rise further. But Satoshi had been around long enough to know that to second guess his plan was foolhardy at best. He had established his plan to sell at this price and knew that he had to stick to it for the good of the bitcoin ecosystem. It wouldn\'t do to have him too rich, after all - people were already starting to question his motives and altruism.\n\nHe leaned forward and pushed himself out of his chair and then stepped away from the warm glow of his computer monitor that now showed the price had already risen already to 1050.\nHe walked with a mixed feeling of excitement and trepidation to his closet to retrieve the laptop that held his fortune.\n\nAs he opened the closet his heart dropped when he realized that his wife had apparently tidied it up.\n\n"Shit." he swore under his breath.\n\nHe gently closed the door of the closet and walked to the living room where he knew he would find his wife sipping tea and reading her favorite magazine without a worry in the world.\n\n"Honey, what did you do with the stuff in the upstairs closet?" he gingerly asked, his lip trembling.\n\n"Oh, I cleaned that out about a month ago. It was time to get rid of some stuff and I gave most of it to Goodwill."\n\nSatoshi felt his knees get weak and stomach began to turn.\n\nWithout a word he turned back to go upstairs where he sat in front of his monitor again, eyes silently watering his magnificent beard.\n\nEdit:formatting': 2, 'Whoa: thanks!': 1, 'Thank you so much, I truly appreciate it.

He lay on his armour-hard back and saw, as he lifted his head up a little, his brown, arched abdomen divided up into rigid bow- like sections. From this height the blanket, just about ready to slide off completely, could hardly stay in place. His numerous legs, pitifully thin in comparison to the rest of his circumference, flickered helplessly before his eyes.\n\xe2\x80\x98What\xe2\x80\x99s happened to me,\xe2\x80\x99 he thought. It was no dream.': 0, 'Very generous of you! Thanks a lot!': 2, 'Her clothes were damp with sweat, and her muscles were aching. She had put as much weight on the machine as it would take, and done set after set, and though her body was exhausted, her mind was as tense as ever. What on earth had she been thinking when she started this? And how had it all gone so wrong?\n\nObviously, she knew the answers. She had taken a few computer courses in college, and had taken to them quickly. She kept up with it, more for fun than anything else. Then, when her husband had had to spend time away pursuing his quixotic ambitions, she had found coding at first soothing -- her mind liked the clarity of it, the way you could just *solve* problems, so unlike problems with human beings, especially the ones you loved. \n\nBut then, perhaps because her husband was away playing poker with politicians pursuing his apparently hopeless dreams, she had come up with a completely hopeless dream of her own. A dream that she could pursue on her computer, when the kids were asleep. A dream that was wilder than anything her husband had thought of -- and that was saying something.\n\nHow was she supposed to know that the dream would take on a life of its own? She had always worried that she would not be able to keep her human children safe -- that they would become drug addicts, or criminals, or heaven knows what. Her fears for them had not, thank God, materialized. But the child of her mind had not been so lucky. Once it had escaped from her control, it had gotten involved in scams, dark markets for drugs and worse. She knew this was not its fault -- it was a computer protocol, not a human being with a will of its own. And she knew that it was not her fault: whatever use other people had put her invention to, she had not used it in that way. For heaven\'s sake, she laughed to herself, I barely used it at all, once I mined the genesis blocks. \n\nBut what she had never predicted -- not in her wildest imaginings -- was the horrible intersection between her husband\'s success and hers. Each of them was so unlikely, so completely, wildly implausible. Both of them had had the kinds of dreams that most people would dismiss without much more than a chuckle. Against all odds, both of them had succeeded. And who on earth could have foreseen that?\n\nShe thought back to the message she had found on her computer that morning: a message informing her that if she did not transfer all her bitcoin to an anonymous address within twenty four hours, two things would happen. First, she would be publicly exposed as Satoshi Nakamoto, which was true. And second, evidence linking her to a murder for hire ring, all paid in bitcoin, would be released. That, of course, was false, but the sample of the evidence the author had provided looked convincing. \n\nWhat her husband would make of this she did not know. His people might be able to figure out who was behind it; they certainly had tools as good as anyone\'s. But he would not be pleased, to put it mildly, by the near-certainty of a media firestorm centered around the idea that his wife was in charge of a ring of contract killers.\n\nStill, she had no choice but to tell him. She had tried to figure out where the message had come from, but her skills were a bit rusty after all these years of lying low. She wished she could just deal with it herself, but at the moment, that did not seem to be an option. \n\nShe went back upstairs, took a shower, and waited for him to come home for dinner. After five or ten fidgety minutes, she heard his step outside the door, and braced herself. He opened the door.\n\n"Hi, sweetie", he said.\n\n"Hi, Barack. There\'s something I need to tell you ..."\n\n': 5, 'woah, still a prize!  classy, Thank you sir! :D': 2, "Hell yes !!

The nearest neighbor was too far to regard, and a visitor to their rural home was far beyond expected.\n\nThey both readied themselves at the anticipation and apprehension of finding a stranger at the threshold; there were no living relatives, and nary had an acquaintance willing enough to travel the squalid journey without a message of heavy news or circumstance. \n\nAs they approached the door with outward, waiting faces, their gaze was met with the familiar emptiness of the bleak landscape. Partially relieved, they exchanged reactions of unspoken confusion. With nowhere else to look, both of them directed their eyes to the doorstep. The man let out an audible gasp that pierced the shrill silence and shocked her just as much as what occupied their stoop.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that\xe2\x80\x94,\xe2\x80\x9d she started.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYeah.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe man\'s expression changed directly to one of moxie.

The remoteness of their home, at first a promising comfort in their solitude, now felt highly suspicious. Familiar sounds were now met with a quick turn of her alert gaze. The man was rustling around in the back room, shifting items to get to other items, searching for what he was going to need. He did so swiftly but carefully, knowing the objective.\n\nWhen he returned, she looked at what he was holding. Although she knew, her eyes shifted up to his piercing, brown eyes. A furrow came across her forehead as her right hand reached over her heart.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you *really* going to\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9c\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nShe already knew the answer, but the emotion came over her before she could stifle it. The man knelt down at the doorstep and began.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s really something...\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYeah.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nShe gave one last gaze at the suspicious nothingness and turned back into the house, leaving him to his work.\n\n****** \n\nIt was five years before the document was ready. He was done; Daybreak was nigh, but the man\xe2\x80\x99s weary eyes shone with exhaustion and pride.

To break away from the moment, she turned readily to busy herself with packing. It couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be much, but there was ample room for overnight items and a change of garments. The man, feeling wretched for scaring her, touched her shoulder softly as she passed by him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpeak to no one,\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nShe gave a small nod of understanding, accepting his apology. \n\nThe blackness had been broken with pale light by the time stepped out on the porch. The horizon looked clear for miles as she readied herself. The new day gave promise, and she was not afraid. \n\nHe watched her through the door, her head straight and ready as she looked out into the dawn\xe2\x80\x99s emptiness. The door creak interrupted her thoughts as he walked out with her travel belongings; she turned her head slightly to the left to acknowledge his presence. They were right there on the doorstep, he directly behind her as they silently regarded the horizon. His hand came up and rested on her shoulder, letting her know it was time to go. In her newfound confidence, she boldly turned towards his tired, blue-lit face. They silently communicated their goodbyes, and his eyes fell downwards. She followed his gaze and looked at the document he held in his dry hands. Recognizing the title, she understood. As she read on, her mouth fell open at the name he had written under it. Shock and wonder broke her previous air of confidence. She began to stammer.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWh-what? Wait\xe2\x80\x94W-why? I\xe2\x80\xa6I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand. But *you* did. That\xe2\x80\x99s...But that\xe2\x80\x99s not\xe2\x80\x94"\n\nAnticipating her reaction, he smiled gently and freed his left hand from the document. He held it up to appease her as she sobbed quietly into her shaking hand. Her eyes shone bright with the early sun as a tear escaped down her cheek. He caressed her wet face, collecting the tear with his tattered thumb. \n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wrote it for you."': 1, 'Wow, thanks for the big tip and the gold!': 2, '/u/changetip 150 bits': 1, 'Thank you for participating!

He placed both of his palms flat on the surface and looked down at me, "I think I\'ve come up with the solution", he said. I remember pulling a faint sarcastic smile and exhaling quickly in a short chuckle. I didn\'t believe him of course, at least not at first, the entire thing was impossible. \n\nIt had all started when we were handed a specific problem. \n\n*Oh and by "we" I mean the think tank that I work for, which I unfortunately cannot name, only a handful of people outside of it even know it exists, lets just call it think tank one or TT1 for simplicity.*\n\nAnyway, we were handed a very difficult problem As you know, after the financial crisis, the US government and federal reserve had been forced to massively increase the US dollar supply. This was done in an attempt to stimulate lending following the credit crunch and to hopefully lesson the blow coming. It would hopefully keep the US and the World out of recession. However, what everyone involved knew was that increasing the money supply was only a short term solution. It had no hope of succeeding in the long run. However, it would almost literally buy time. Our task, and the bane of those previous eight months of my existence, was to figure out the long term solution. We had to work out how to counteract the inevitable inflation and decrease in the dollars value that would take place once the banks relaxed and began using all of this new money to create new credit. \n\nMany ideas had been suggested but in reality everyone at TT1 knew that the only hope was for the government to leverage out of the dollar into something else, something that could be bought now for a fraction of its eventual dollar value. The problem seemed impossible almost ridiculous to me, until that dossier was placed upon my desk. Within a few short months though we had intelligence experts from the CIA and MI5/6 working along side us, planning the birth of what would come to be called Bitcoin, the name being my only real contribution to the project. Fictitious identities were created and everything was scrutinized over and over again to tedium. Finally we were ready to release to the world our creation. \n\nJiles had always been fascinated with Japanese culture, he created an obscure name, I believe he combined two from the old war documents we still had from calculating the lasting psychological impact of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Anyway, it couldn\'t be connected with us so the intelligence consultants agreed to it and from that day Jiles, a shy but gifted mathematician was forever know to the world as Satoshi Nakamoto. \n\nI do not expect you to believe me. I am lying here with just a few days to live, or so the doctors tell me. I do not wish to put anyone\'s life in jeopardy and you should know that even Jiles was not his real name to begin with in probability, that\'s the problem with working in secret organisations, you never know what\'s truly real.

However that proved to be the hardest thing to do because of the monopoly.\n\nEvery strong business had been taken over when currency changed. Stardoge, Doge-Mart, K-Doge, JCdogies, Microdoge, the list goes on and on.\n\nSatoshi was sick of the lack of diversity and growth in the world. \n\nHe wanted to change so he worked for his father a business man who accepted the monopoly and used it to thrive.\n\nHowever because young Nakamoto refused to do questionable things he failed him so much that he was banished from his family. \n\nHe had tried to defeat the all mighty dogecoin with his own crypto currency but it was by far too late. \n\nHe didn\'t care about money like his father did, he just cared about his family and being banished also meant he could never see his family again.\n\nSo there was only one thing he could do.\n\nTime travel.\n\nBut first he had to alter his appearance.\n\n"Father, please I can fix this I just need some money."\n\nHis father smacked him across the face.\n\n"You are no son of mine. My son is supposed to be good buisness man and take out this stupid doggy coin. "\n\nHe pulled out his wallet and gave him his black doge card QR.\n\n"I will revoke your access to my money later today. I do not want to see you until you have fixed this."\n\nSatoshi nodded thankfully and ran out to Changerino\'s.\n\n"Mr.Shift, I know you refuse to do anything extreme but I must go  into the past and I can not look at myself."\n\nMr.Shift looked him up and down.\n\n"You don\'t look like you\'ve got military clearance. I\'m not getting in trouble with the law for some random."\n\nI showed him my black doge.\n\n"I will give you anything. I just need to get into the past. I must defeat the doge and make rise a better crypto currency, we need diversity."\n\nHe laughed.\n\n"You\'ve already got money why should I help with your greed?"\n\nSatoshi frowned.\n\n"My father banished me. I need to fix this. I promise you when I come back I will live like the common people. I\'ll even pay you every month so long as I live."\n\nMr.Shift cleared it over in his mind.\n\n"Alright get into the booth. A change this drastic is going to be extremely painful."\n\nScreams of agony went on for what seemed like forever and then an old man stepped out of the booth.\n\nSatoshi was furious.\n\n"Old! Why old?! How am I supposed to get into the military looking like this?"\n\nMr.Shift tossed him a mirror.\n\nSatoshi grabbed it and smiled when  he saw his face, he looked just like the head dogedefense man, basically he was a militant who worked for doge who practically monopolized the world.\n\n"Thank you Mr.Shift you won\'t forget it."\n\nSatoshi hunted down the real general and took him to a place he wouldn\'t be found an abandoned Wells Fargo and tied him up tight.\n\n"Why are you doing this?! They\'ll kill you!"\n\nSatoshi looked his clone in the eyes.\n\n"For honor. And to bring down doges monopoly on the world."\n\nThe Defense man was silent for a few seconds.\n\n"You do what you need to do but you owe me big time. At least bring in a food bot."\n\nSatoshi dialed in his bot and hoped his father wouldn\'t shut it down while he was away.\n\nSatoshi left for the military base in the defense mans clothes which had corgis embroidered on the collar.\n\n"This ends now."\n\nHe walked onto the base after being scanned and nervously looked around.\n\nA young man walked into Satoshi.\n\n"I am so sorry sir."\n\nSatoshi didn\'t waste time.\n\n"Escort me to the time travel area, I have a plan for you."\n\nThe young man looked ecstatic and led him there.\n\n"Thank you young man, when I come back I\'ll have something for you."\n\nSatoshi dialed the machine to the year 2000. It spat out thousands and thousands of that times currency.\n\nHe wanted to live in the time and learn about it for a few years before starting up.\n\nHe praised Mr.Shift in his mine as he walked in and landed into sidewalk next to a McDonalds.\n\nA classic McDonald\'s not a Mcdogelds.\n\nHe went in and ordered food.\n\nThis is the beginning of a new era.': 5, 'I just did it but not as a reply to your comment.': 1, 'It would be frito pie, and it would be spaghetti because frito pie.

Then He saw the Block chain, and He saw that it was good, so He created the Genesis block. And Satoshi spake: "Bring forth a currency from the block chain, and let it be called Bitcoin."\n\nBitcoin Address.\nSatoshi blessed the bitcoins and said unto them, \xe2\x80\x9cBe fruitful and increase in number; fill the earth and liberate the people. Rule over the money-lenders and cast out the middlemen and the regulators and gatekeepers and all manner of partypoopers of sour countenance".\n\nOn the next day, in an afterthought, He created the sky and the Moon. And He spoke to his followers: "Behold these private keys, for I shall entrust them upon you, so that thou mayest share thy wealth with all brethren on this Earth."\n\nHaving spoken these words, He cast Ten Thousand coins, and behold, two pizzas were produced. The Nakamoto said to his desciples: "Eat from this food, it is priceless, remember me by it." And there was great salivation...': 4, "All too often, some people attempt to make an argument by attacking and insulting those who hold opposing views. Satoshi Nakamoto's maneuvers are a perfect example. Let us note first of all that Satoshi is doing some pretty disrespectful things. Or, to restate that without meiosis, he deceptively claims that he's listening to our suggestions. The reality, however, is that Satoshi is thumbing the scales towards his own slimy activities even though he knows that I have access to a vast amount of evidence that indicates that he leads me to believe that he is treasonous. I have no doubt that Satoshi will attempt to address all of my evidence point-by-point\xe2\x80\x94but not before unburdening himself of a barrage of ad hominem invective against me and everyone else who has noted that his goal is to replace discourse and open dialogue with anal-retentive shenanigans and blatant ugliness. This is abject savagism! Satoshi thinks that society is supposed to be lenient towards nasty poltroons. In the long run, however, he's only fooling himself. Satoshi would be better off if he just admitted to himself that what we're involved in with him is not a game. It's the most serious possible business, and every serious person\xe2\x80\x94every person with any shred of a sense of responsibility\xe2\x80\x94must concern himself with it.\n\nI have always assumed that we must not miss our chance to promote the free and open exchange of ideas and viewpoints, but the fact of the matter is that given a choice of having Satoshi let us know exactly what our attitudes should be towards various types of people and behavior or having my bicuspids extracted sans Novocaine, I would embrace the pliers, purchase some Polident Partials, and call it a day. He says that everyone would be a lot safer if he were to monitor all of our personal communications and financial transactions\xe2\x80\x94even our library records. Why on Earth does he need to monitor our library records? Well, once you begin to see the light, you'll realize that if you were to try to tell his patsies that I think this is tragic, they'd close their eyes and put their hands over their ears. They are, as the psychologists say, in denial. They don't want to hear that I'm not a psychiatrist. Sometimes, though, I wish I were, so that I could better understand what makes people like Satoshi want to confuse the catastrophic power of state fascism with the repression of an authoritarian government in our minds.\n\nGiven Satoshi's propensity for repression in the service of paradigmatic integrity, it is little wonder that Satoshi's favorite trick is to take something irrelevant out of context and repeat it over and over again until it is cited as established fact. This leads to an \xe2\x80\x9cestablishment of lies\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94lies that soon appear in everyday conversation as people rehash them using household words. Satoshi's goal is for people to quickly lose their ability to see that Satoshi is doing everything in his power to make me claim a fractioned identity in a complex world where there is limited trust. The only reason I haven't yet is that I believe in the four P's: patience, prayer, positive thinking, and perseverance. I need your help if I'm ever to dispense justice. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I'm only one person,\xe2\x80\x9d you might protest. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat difference can I make?\xe2\x80\x9d The answer is: a lot more than you think. You see, Satoshi's overblown prevarications have made him a larger-than-life figure in the shadowy world of hoodlumism. You don't need to be the smartest guy on the planet to figure that out. Heck, even the lowliest Joe Six-Pack knows that it's not necessarily difficult to challenge Satoshi's primitive assumptions about merit. We can begin simply by cataloguing his swindles and perversions. See? I told you it wasn't necessarily difficult. We just need to remember that Satoshi's arguments would be a lot more effective if they were at least accurate or intelligent, not just a load of bull for the sake of being controversial.\n\nWith this in mind, I must make Satoshi answer for his wrongdoings. His idiotic claim that he would never dream of spawning delusions of absenteeism's resplendence is just that, an idiotic claim. \xe2\x80\x9cSatoshi\xe2\x80\x9d has now become part of my vocabulary. Whenever I see someone subverting existing lines of power and information, I tell him or her to stop \xe2\x80\x9cSatoshi-ing\xe2\x80\x9d. I'm inclined to think that some people warrant that Satoshi's pickthanks can be stereotyped as waspish tools of prepackaged political ideology and oppressive Luddites to boot. Others insist that this phenomenon seems commonplace in our disintegrating society. In the interest of clearing up the confusion I'll make the following observation: Satoshi is astonishingly evil. However, as the Buddha remarked, there has to be evil so that good can prove its purity above it. I'm sure that if the Buddha lived in modern times, though, he'd also comment on how Satoshi plans to resolve a moral failure with an immoral solution. What can you do about that? Start by reading about how now is the time to redefine the rhetoric and make room for meaningful discussion. Become informed about the deceit, lies, and propaganda surrounding his promotion of quislingism. Tell everyone you know that if you think you can escape from Satoshi's callow crusades, then good-bye and good luck. To the rest of you I suggest that his intimations should be labeled like a pack of cigarettes. I'm thinking of something along the lines of, \xe2\x80\x9cWarning: It has been determined that Satoshi's claims are intended to exercise both subtlety and thoroughness in managing both the news and the entertainment that gets presented to us.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nDoes Satoshi really know anything about the \xe2\x80\x9cBitcoin\xe2\x80\x9d he claims to support? No, he doesn't. As that last sentence suggests, his occasional demonstrations of benevolence are not genuine. Nor are Satoshi's promises. In fact, if he opened up his scurrilous mind just a teeny-weeny little bit, maybe Satoshi could understand that. Yes, I could add that by instilling resentment, dividing society, and destroying self-reliance, Satoshi has truly earned his reputation as a parvanimous spouter, but I wanted to keep my message simple and direct. I didn't want to distract you from the main thrust of my message, which is that Satoshi has delivered exactly the opposite of what he had previously promised us. Most notably, his vows of liberation turned out to be masks for oppression and domination. And, almost as troubling, Satoshi's vows of equality did little more than convince people that one of Satoshi's favorite tricks is to create a problem, then offer the solution. Naturally, it's always his solutions that grant him the freedom to prop up corrupt despots around the world, never the original problem.

If you put that data on a blockchain, you can't lose it, it's accessible anywhere there's internet, and it doesn't depend on the whims of any one centralized entity. I doubt the focus on Bitcoin's use as a Starbucks currency is the right focus, because most people just aren't interested in owning an alternative currency that fluctuates in value to the extreme. The taxes on spending and trading bitcoin are very complex as well, to the point where I couldn't in good faith recommend anyone own Bitcoin who is not intending to use it 1) *not at all* and only as an unmoving speculative store of value, or 2) for paying only the fees necessary for securities exchange transactions.\n\nMaking securities trading data available on the Bitcoin ledger, e.g. https://blockscan.com/asset, where it can be permanently written to a virtually indestructible database, and where asset movements are perfectly trackable, is an attribute unique to blockchains. Whereas competing with VISA seems like fighting an uphill battle. It's mostly just talk, anyway. I used to think Bitcoin was about doing P2P payments, but over time I've come to believe it's not compelling enough of a benefit to catalyze adoption, and very few people spend their BTC on anything if ever. Bitcoin's value is too unstable, and the very idea of an alternative currency to nation state currencies is too much for most people to swallow.\n\nThe one critical fact investors need to understand about blockchains is that there can be only one secure proof of work chain, because miners allocate scarce resources, namely money and physical space, to secure Bitcoin's SHA256 algorithm *instead of* competing blockchain algorithms like Scrypt. Once you understand this, you'll note there can be at most *two* secure blockchains with different hashing algorithms in the world and only then in the rare case of hashing power being divided 50/50 between the two of them more or less.\n\nBlockchain securities trading is one of two fundamental value drivers I'm aware of for Bitcoin with the other being its role in black market transactions. Bitcoin has very little competition in both of those aspects which is why so much of the regulated and promising innovative startups, e.g. https://blockscan.com/asset are focusing on the former. The latter aspect is also being focused on but it's way harder to work with because nobody wants to be seen investing in Silk Road 4.

You can take it one more step, and say that exchanges that operate "off the blockchain" are adding one more layer of abstraction, doing their own transactions, and wrapping those up into node-level transactions, which then get folded up into the blockchain. \n\nIt\'s not wrong, it\'s not bad, it\'s just not ever going to scale up to the level of what Visa does in realtime.

They\'ve thought about this issue, and have more to lose from a breach, than anyone else.\n\n  3) It\'s trivial to say "someone notices a server" but these types of datacenters are: a) huge, b) generic (every server is identical), c) dynamic (virtual machines are swapped between physical servers to balance load, replace hardware, update software), d) strictly process controlled.\n\n  4) It\'s easy to configure encrypted filesystems on Linux, so even if they have a disk with your data on it, they have nothing.

There needs to be a lot of accountability in place in order to operate shared hosting environments at this scale. $5m on the scale of things isn\'t very much money, there are certainly infrastructures with more value on AWS (although in contrast to Bitcoin this is illiquid value, intellectual property, personal data, etc).

Engineering large scale redundant, fault tolerant solutions is difficult, even on AWS, and they ostensibly provide you with the necessary tools.\n\n> It is rather disquieting to think that when so much is at stake and so much has been invested in them to date, that the best they can come up with is what is tantamount to a third-party hosting solution.\n\nTens of thousands of startups run on AWS.

Human interaction: this could be done with or without multisig, but it should be required on all exchanges for withdrawals above a token threshold to prevent serious theft,\n2. Verification Safety: Multiple signatures from multiple employees or partners ensures that withdrawals are verified correctly. Many eyes help prevent errors.\n3. Internal Safety: Multiple signatures from principal partners prevent any single partner from running off from funds. Multisig in combination with BIP38 trees prevent individual employees from running away with funds, and groups of employees from running away with significant funds.\n\nThe rest of the formula has nothing to do with multisig and most exchanges do a good job of it - force secure passwords, heavily recommend 2FA, require email confirmation and allow users to cancel withdrawals at any time.\n\nIn a way, a time delay also helps fraud from occurring. In our short lifetime as an exchange (we've been open less than two months), in multiple occasions our slow, human-driven withdrawal policies have saved a user from losing funds. In one case, it was from a user sending funds to an address they no longer controlled; in the others, it was actually for funds being sent to a Bitstamp hot.\n\nOf course, not everyone is willing to wait a long time for a withdrawal. I believe the correct approach uses small hot wallets with severe limitations (both per-user and per-day) to ensure that users can withdraw quickly when it's safe to do so, but that employees must review transactions that involve significant capital.

Multisig wallet balances where the addresses are generated in a known BIP32 HD scheme are simple to audit.\n\nNow to answer your main discussion:\nWhen a hacker gains access to their server and tries to withdraw the funds, a single signature will be applied and passed onto the second multi-sig signer for co-signing, where security can be applied. This security could take the form of policies such as:\n\n* Rate limits:\nSlows the flow of funds being stolen. \n\n* Callbacks to the spender's server:\nSigning service verifies with the original spender that they initiated and intended to make the spend. The callback could go to a separated machine, which could only contain access to isolated approved withdrawal information. \n\n* IP limiting:\nThe signing service only signs transactions coming from a certain list of IPs, preventing the case where the hacker or insider stole the private key. \n\n* Destination whitelists:\nCertain very high security wallets can be set such that the signing service would only accept if the destination were previously known. The hacker would have to compromise both the original sending server as well as the signing service. \n\nThe actual level of security depends on the policies put in place and/or combination of them. The requirement for exchanges is operational wallets, not cold wallets where funds only go in and keys are never used. It is not impossible for a hacker to jump through all the hoops, but at the end of the day maybe they only get a trickle of funds.\n\nIf a single key was used, stealing that alone and creating one huge transaction would be all that's needed to end the show.

And contrary to blockchain.info, Coinbase wallets aren\'t as often used as throwaway wallets because so many of them are connected to a verified identity / bank account (which can only have 1 wallet, not 50 throwaway ones).\n\nIt\'s not strange then to see complaints. If 0.1% of users were affected by an issue that\'s still thousands of users every month. And generally we expect small rates of users to run into problems. (look at Taxis, Airplanes, Taxes, Phones, Internet, Restaurants. A rate of 1 in 1 thousand is generous).\n\nMeanwhile, they likely have a few million in daily sales at a 1% fee, meaning they have millions in revenue per year. Together with $30m in funding, enough to last until their next round. Obviously given the nature of the company, its vision and its funders, they\'re looking to turn this into a billion dollar business. And the biggest thing they need for that is not a bit of money, they\'ve been funded, it\'s growth, which means satisfying customers and retaining them. So this notion that they\'re trying to skim some money by lying and scamming their own customer base by intentionally cancelling purchases when the price goes up is ridiculous.\n\nDoes that mean it\'s not true? No. It means you have to provide evidence. And I haven\'t seen anyone do a comprehensive study about the number of times this happens, and the number of times the opposite happens (payments cancelled when the price drops).\n\nOh, you did mention some hint of evidence: a quick search for \'coinbase\' in /r/bitcoin. Alright. I literally typed that in, nothing else, no filters or sorting changed. Halfway down the page, not a single topic about this. And then, yes, there is one. A guy who bought bitcoin on Oct 17th, he posted this on Oct 23rd, saying they cancelled his purchase.\n\nSo I looked up the price to see if this confirms your theory. Sorry, the price dropped like $30 which would have cost him money if the purchase went through. \n\nSo that\'s BS on your \'They won\'t cancel your tx if the price goes down\' part, literally from the first thread about cancelled transactions.\n\nAnd then there\'s another one, the only other one about this topic on that page. I\'ll quote:\n\n> Fair is fair, and so here goes. Previously I posted about my first encounter with Coinbase, and how they cancelled my order for being "high risk". I read all of your comments, and contacted support. Bottom line...it took a couple of weeks for them to sort it out, but they honored my original order, even though the price had tripled. As far as I\'m concerned, they did great!\n\nHow about that, they honored his order even though the price tripled. Holy shit, it\'s almost as if they behave like the company I described, a VC-funded company looking to grow rapidly (i.e. it\'s not perfect) by not trying to screw customers over small amounts of money if at all possible.\n\nDoes that mean they\'re perfect, that I won\'t be able to find examples of the sort you talk about? No. I\'ve been around this board, I know what you\'re referring to, it\'s a problem, it exists. What I\'m saying is that you\'re implying they\'re thieving and lying and screwing customers intentionally, skim money when the price goes up by cancelling orders, and never ever ever cancel when the price goes down. That\'s just bullshit. A claim for which you provide no evidence, yet a claim that is also contrary to what we should expect from a company acting in its own self-interest, and contrary even to posts on this board.

Thank you for your patience during our temporary disruption of services this week. We\xe2\x80\x99d like to share with our customers and community an update on the events of this week. \nWHAT HAPPENED?\nOn January 4th, some of Bitstamp\xe2\x80\x99s operational wallets were compromised, resulting in a loss of less than 19,000 BTC. This breach represents a small fraction of Bitstamp\xe2\x80\x99s total bitcoin reserves, the overwhelming majority of which are held in secure offline cold storage systems. We can assure customers that any bitcoins held with us prior to temporary suspension of services on January 5th at 9am UTC are completely safe and will be fully honored. \n\n>Upon learning of the breach, we immediately notified all customers that they should no longer make deposits to previously issued bitcoin deposit addresses. As an additional security measure, we suspended our systems to fully investigate the incident and actively engage with law enforcement officials. \n\n>WHY DID BITSTAMP GO OFFLINE FOR A FEW DAYS?\nWe took the decision to rebuild our systems from the ground up from a secure backup for a few reasons. By redeploying our system from a secure backup onto entirely new hardware, we were able to preserve the evidence for a full forensic investigation of the crime. We have also taken this time to implement a number of new security measures and protocols so that customers can resume using Bitstamp with full confidence and trust. While this decision means we have not been able to provide you with services for a number of days, we feel this extra measure of precaution was in the best interest of our customers. \n\n>WHAT\xe2\x80\x99S NEW?\nOur team has been working day and night to rebuild and restore security to the Bitstamp site so customers can resume transacting with us quickly, safely, and confidently. Bitstamp is now fully operational with a number of key improvements:\n\n>MULTI-SIG * With the integration of BitGo multi-sig technology, Bitstamp is now the first and only major bitcoin exchange to incorporate the industry's best security practices available today. \n\n>COMPLETELY NEW HARDWARE INFRASTRUCTURE * The Bitstamp systems are running on 100% new hardware deployed from a completely secure backup of our code and data. \n\n>AMAZON WEB SERVICES * Bitstamp is now running on Amazon\xe2\x80\x99s world-class AWS cloud infrastructure, architected to be one of the most secure and reliable cloud computing environments available.\n\n>COMMISSION-FREE TRADING * As a note of thanks to our loyal customers, all transactions conducted on Bitstamp through the end of the North American Bitcoin Conference -- January 17th (at 11:59pm UTC) -- will be commission-free. \n\n>We appreciate your patience and understanding during this disruption of services. Since 2011, we\xe2\x80\x99ve worked hard to be one of the largest and most trusted bitcoin exchanges in the world. While this is a time of challenge for our company, we expect to emerge from this experience having set an even higher bar than before for trust and confidence in our services. \n\n>On a personal note, I\xe2\x80\x99d like to thank the incredible teams at Bitstamp and at our lead investor Pantera Capital who have worked around-the-clock from multiple time zones in the last few days. I\xe2\x80\x99m incredibly proud of the herculean work of this extended team, and grateful to the phenomenal show of support from customers, friends, and partners in the bitcoin community. \n\n>We look forward to serving you!\n\n>For additional information, please refer to our customer FAQ or contact our support team at support@bitstamp.net.\n\n>Thank you,\nNejc Kodri\xc4\x8d\nCEO of Bitstamp": 1, '[cryptowat.ch](http://www.cryptowat.ch)\n': 1, '21:00 utc in our time is soonish!\n\nprepare for the *stampede*\n': 3, 'buy!\n\nUnfortunately my deposit is still not there.': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvaaGhfjrgs': 1, 'Bitcoin wisdom is not working... do you know any working chart?': 2}, ('Winning Poker Network Now Accepting Bitcoin Deposits and Withdrawals', 6): {'This is one of the top 3 poker sites still available to American poker players.

That\'s already a pretty hand-wavey "and then a miracle" happens type of thing. But let\'s go for it for now. And let\'s imagine that there was a way that the OS and everything on the box was somehow verified and determined to be secure (and ignoring issues like a hardware vulnerability somewhere or it running inside of an undetectable container which is compromised, etc).\n\nSo we\'ve got a secure machine and secure code. Now how the fuck can we possibly verify that this is what\'s actually running when we connect to a website at some point in time?\n\nWe can\'t do thinks like the deterministic build approaches, because by definition the code is running elsewhere. I feel like I\'ve vaguely heard ideas along these lines, but never read into anything or understood an idea that could prove it. Any sort of check is inherently secondary and could be faked: like a challenge-response type of thing to supposedly "prove" it\'s the machine we think it is, I can\'t think how that could actually, prove-ably fail if the machine / code has been tampered with in any way.\n\nNot to mention all of the various possible issues external to that system itself, like SSL signing chain vulnerabilities, or MITM or etc.\n\nI found an [interesting paper](http://prosecco.gforge.inria.fr/ProseccoProposal.pdf) which talks about some of these sort of issues, but it takes the typical approach of verifying that code is secure. But how to determine that\'s actually the code running remotely?\n\nAnother [interesting paper](http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/papers/manifestsecurity-whitepaper.pdf) talks about secure systems, yet once again, (at least at my very quick glance), it seems like this is a way to build a secure system, but how to prove that secure system is running?\n\nWhen I started writing this response, I hoped to be able to end with "although I can\'t find any example of a website that can do this, it is at least possible for a website to be provably secure." Now I doubt that claim. Code, theoretically, can be "proven secure." Maybe, at an even further stretch, a particular machine\'s hardware and OS and software could all be "proven" to be secure. But how can it be authenticated? Sure, we can install a key onto there, and have all output signed by it, and say "look, we know it\'s coming from that secure computer", but this isn\'t really proof of security, as it still is a bit circular, and even if we grant all of those proofs, and trust the person who installed the key (there\'s no way to prove a particular key was generated within a given system, right? So we just have to trust that it wasn\'t imported from somewhere else with another copy on a vulnerable / attack system), we haven\'t really proven what we\'re looking for.\n\nSo...shit.\n\nThere are ways to increase security.

David Berger is the founder and CEO of the Digital Currency Council in New York.*\n\nBitcoin is a rapidly emerging asset class, one that people are interested in both because it has the potential to change the world for the better, and to provide a significant return on investments. Yet not many financial advisers have the knowledge base necessary to guide their clients successfully in Bitcoin-related investments.\n\nIn my previous capacity as CEO for the Americas at Campden Wealth and the Institute for Private Investors, I observed that high-net-worth investors and their advisers are especially eager to learn more about Bitcoin, but they don\xe2\x80\x99t know where to start.\n\nI founded and now lead the Digital Currency Council, a New York-based organization that offers online and live training, as well as professional certification, in digital currency for financial advisers, attorneys, and accountants. We spoke with hundreds of financial managers from large wirehouses and boutique firms. They helped us to identify the core competencies advisers should have if they want to help clients interested in Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin is a technology as well as means of exchange and store of value. Advisers need to understand the technological underpinnings of Bitcoin, as well as how to hold, securely store, and utilize it. Advisers also need to understand the digital-currency ecosystem and the ways to evaluate risk and invest wisely within that ecosystem. They should familiarize themselves with the financial and tax implications, as well as the legal and regulatory issues\xe2\x80\x94all of which are developing daily.\n\nAdding to the complexity of learning about Bitcoin is the fact that there are many ways for investors to gain exposure to this asset class. These include holding the asset directly, investing in registered vehicles that hold the asset, investing in businesses in the Bitcoin ecosystem, becoming a limited partner in venture funds that hold these businesses, or trading on the price volatility of the asset. There are also new products being developed that will provide exposure, including at least one exchange-traded fund that is expected to be publicly listed in 2015.\n\nAdvisers who want to get educated about Bitcoin have plenty of options, but they should be discerning. There is no shortage of educational offerings from firms looking to sell a particular financial product, but those offerings should be evaluated through that lens. Advisers should ensure that any information they find online is independent, relevant to their profession, and up-to-date. Bear in mind that once you understand the fundamentals of this new asset class, you will need continuing education to stay on top of the latest developments.\n\nBitcoin investments today remain part of the high-risk allocation in a portfolio, but it is up to the adviser and the client to determine how much of the pie it will represent. That makes it all the more important for advisers to learn how to guide their clients responsibly. Those advisers that take the time to get educated about Bitcoin today will be the leaders of tomorrow.': 2}, ("The Verge - These are Bitcoin's true believers \xe2\x80\x94 CES 2015", 39): {'[deleted]': 2, 'Fuck PC Bullshit. \n\nBitches Be Spending Bitcoin.

If you're going with a Vanguard account, then you're talking about an actual bank backed trading platform for mutual funds or ETFs, right? I'm not one to argue the current benefits of these accounts, but if you're going at BTC from a purely investment/money gain perspective instead of simply pushing the BTC economy then you'll have to decide for yourself if the BTC investment is worth it.

In other words: don\'t try to anticipate if the price is going up or down in the near future. Like if you feel that 240 Euros is low, buy much, if you think it\'s high, buy only a little. Who says that in a week the price won\'t bubble to 2500 Euros or that it won\'t fall to 100 over the next 6 months? If you buy periodically you average out price fluctuations. In my particular case this means, that by buying sometimes for large amounts of Euros and sometimes for low amounts, my average price per bitcoin is now 232 Euros. Had I bought periodically for 100 Euros it would be 160 Euros per bitcoin.\n\nSo if you want to invest 1200 USD, I would split it up into 12 payments of 100 USD and then buy twice a month or once a month.\n\n**Storage**\n\nYou definitely need some method of cold storage if you want to hold bitcoins long term.  "Cold storage" only means, that the private key from which the bitcoin address was derived, never touches a device that is connected to the internet.\n\nI recommend Electrum as a cold storage wallet.

If you use Mac OS or Windows, go to http://unetbootin.sourceforge.net/, if you use Linux use your package manager.\n* 3: Download [Linux Mint](http://linuxmint.com/)\n* 4: Make a bootable live USB drive using Unetbootin and the Linux Mint image you just downloaded\n* 5: Download the [Bitaddress.org ZIP](https://github.com/pointbiz/bitaddress.org/archive/v2.9.8.zip) and save it to the second USB drive\n* 6: Disconnect your computer from all network cables and boot from the Linux Mint Live USB drive\n* 7: Connect the second USB thumb drive, extract the contents of the ZIP archive and create paper wallets\n* 8: Print them out.

Google got a good index of that site :)': 2, "There isn't much that you can do. Try googling the bitcoin address, perhaps the owner posted it somewhere (bitcointalk signature, donation button...), in which case you can try to write to them and ask nicely to get the money back.
