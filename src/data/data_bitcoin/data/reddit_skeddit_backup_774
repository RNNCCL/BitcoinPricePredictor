The idea of storing value is that when you store value at very low risk, you\'re not supposed to be compensated very well for that - all you\'re doing is holding off spending for now. \n\nWhen you make the monetary supply nominally fixed, which is what bitcoin does by design, the force on the other side of the discount rate kicks in - innovation and the growth of the economy. In a "stable bitcoin world" (one where bitcoin is widely adopted, not fluctuating in price, and can be used for almost all transactions), once all the bitcoin is minted, an investor can capture the entire growth of the economy, with no risk, by simply postponing spending.\n\nIn sum - right now, just having the luxury to not spend your money right now earns you the risk free rate (let\'s call it 3% to be generous). In a stable bitcoin world, having that luxury earns you the indexed growth of the economy. \n\nSo, the answer to your question depends on what your projections of future global GDP growth are, and whether you think it\'s more fair/equitable/desirable for a currency to preserve buying power over time, or function as an investment vehicle.': 4, 'Congratulations, you\'ve figured out how to operate an economy free from the mechanisms carefully crafted over the years to encourage economic growth and dampen recessions/depressions.\n\nIf you can sit on bitcoin and get GDP growth, there is no need to invest in anything.  How would that be good for the economy??\n\nInstead of using the term "saving", you should use the term "hoarding".  In the current economy, saving means putting your money in the bank so it can be lent out to people who will invest it.  You can spend it later (and if the bank goes bust, there\'s FDIC).  \n\nIf "saving" means hoarding, that means the money is taken out of circulation, so GDP goes down (mathematically, it has to).  That\'s how you end up with a situation where factories sit idle, the workers are outside doing nothing, warehouses are full of raw materials nobody can buy, and would-be customers of the factory aren\'t buying anything because they\'re unemployed too, all because the only people with any money are /r/bitcoin, sitting in their mansions laughing, while the rest of the economy can\'t function because they don\'t have bitcoins to facilitate commerce.\n\nI\'m not doing any of this justice - you should read Krugman\'s stuff on this.  Or pretty much any economist in the world with any credibility outside of bitcoin circles.

Throw the drum into the ocean? Burn it? No. You just leave it and they begin to get hungry. And one by one... they start eating each other until there are only two left. The two survivors.

And from what I'm understanding Blockchain.info is still more secure then Electrum from a hackers  point of view": 2, 'When in doubt use trezor': 1, "If you're not confident in your digital security, there is some validity to your concerns that a local computer-based wallet *might* be less secure. Of course, you can secure your computer with a password, just like your phone, but if you have a malware infection on either your mobile or computer, your coins can be stolen.  \n\nThe advantage of a web wallet, like Blockchain.info, is the possibility of using two-factor authentication (2FA). If you aren't currently using this, you should definitely set it up. Two good 2FA apps are Google Authenticator and Authy. 2FA by SMS instant message is typically also available, but may be less secure. You don't want your 2FA device to be the same as the device you use to send bitcoins.  \n\nFor a local wallet, like Electrum, the first and probably best defense would be to use it on an operating system that is not as vulnerable to attack, and that means Linux. Microsoft OS's are the most vulnerable and the most targeted by hackers. Apple OSX is significantly better, but still targeted (Apple users tend to spend more and have more disposable income, hackers know this). The general thinking is, if you keep your computer secure, mobile OS's are newer and less hardened for possible vulnerabilities.  \n\nFor a couple of coins, I suggest looking into a multisig web wallet like [GreenAddress](https://greenaddress.it/en/) or [BitGo](https://www.bitgo.com/), as these should be equally secure from local or mobile as long as 2FA is used.  \n\nFor amounts closer to what you might keep in a savings account or more, some form of cold storage is best. A hardware wallet like a [Trezor](http://www.bitcointrezor.com/) might be simplest. Or you could look into cold paper wallets, or offline signing computers running Electrum or Armory.  \n\nEDIT: I should mention the although digital security is a concern for local wallets, the advantage to them is you depend less on centralized third-party providers to access your funds. If Blockchain.info's website goes down, it makes it hard to access your funds. In this respect a full-node capable local wallet like Bitcoin Core or Armory is the most decentralized, but also the most resource hungry and arguably the least user friendly.

However, that's a quite onerous task, probably stemming from a bad classification of bitcoins and many seem to not be bothered about such documentation.\n\nLast is refunds. Many merchants (like Overstock.com) continue to price products in dollars. If a refund is ever requested it's probably best to refund the dollar amount, possibly by the same method (bitcoin) requiring a re-calculation of exchange rate.

Say an address is used to pay someone known (eg. a business with your info) and then at another time is combined into a transaction with the address you desire to be secret - that associates them. A common way this happens is with "change" outputs, which feed btc back to your wallet and often get pulled into a new transaction. "Change" is easy to re-associate between trxs.\n\nYou need for every input to the trx to be "clean", only used once and from an unknown origin, and to make sure any change is not reused in an unrelated trx. Managing this requires careful attention. Some wallets offer "coin control" for this purpose but many  hide this mechanism for convenience.\n\nWeb wallets (like Coinbase) use common pooled addresses and so may or may not mix inputs in random ways. But this isn\'t useful anyway since they very obviously know who you are. \n\nIt is possible to make a wallet which combines inputs from unrelated owners. I think Dark Wallet may have some functionality like that but I haven\'t really researched what they\'re doing beyond obviously some mix capability.': 2, 'Your IP address is not in the blockchain.

If someone knew you used an address at one point, they MIGHT be able to do some investigation and find out where else you sent the money.

If the first node it's sent to is recording IPs for an authority then it could get captured.

If you run your own server then you can control that. Some Electrum servers and regular nodes offer Tor access. If you send through a web wallet then most likely your IP is logged.

Because gold and silver each provided their own unique utility, completely outside of their liquidity! And specifically, these utilities are mutually exclusive, and could not ever be merged into one using physical metals. That utility is their mass/price ratio.\n\nIf I wanted to buy a car, I would have to carry maybe 20oz of gold down to the car dealer - which is feasible. If I wanted to make this same purchase with silver, I would need to carry 65 times more silver, probably in a wheel barrel because I don\'t have a car yet!\n\nIf I wanted to buy a coffee, I could purchase it using 1/10th of an ounce of silver, which is still a manageable, verifiable, and gives reasonable tactile feedback.

Network effect: It's been hard enough creating mainstream adoption for a system as massive as Bitcoin, let alone some obscure startup coin that probably doesn't actually differ all that much more in the eyes of your average layman (who doesn't  understand Bitcoin to begin with). \n\n2.)

Eg:, Fedcoin, JPMorgancoin, Currentc, GoldmanCoin, whatever, et al... Goto 1. ": 1, 'If there is a good enough "technical" feature, I find it likely that Bitcoin will be able to adopt it. Hard forks (changes that break the network\'s compatibility with older software) are indeed a very big deal, but I expect these changes to take years to decide anyway. In theory, altcoins help this process by testing out new functionality, but I\'ve yet to see a readily implemented feature I\'d want to see in Bitcoin. Privacy enhancing ones would be my first candidates when they are deemed good enough.\n\nIf they work, sidechains (alternative networks that can use Bitcoin\'s money supply) can be used to implement some features that are not really very backwards compatible with Bitcoin transactions. They can also be used to test some slightly different economic models that would be impossible to achieve consensus for in Bitcoin.\n\nOne abstract category is radically different economic models (I currently can\'t think of) that can\'t be implemented satisfactorily as a sidechain. Something like this will have a chance replace Bitcoin, and I don\'t see a problem with it.\n\nAnother scenario is something in Bitcoin suddenly breaking. I think the community has demonstrated that it can recover from software bugs, but what if a weakness in the signing algorithm is discovered? While I don\'t expect an immediately failing fundamental component, unheard of things happen. Current options are still limited to an immediate hard fork, which would cause a lot of disruption. Sidechains might help with this as well. This is also a reason to have altcoins, maybe not a clone like Litecoin, but radically different ones that have replaced many/all components of Bitcoin.\n': 2, 'It doesn\'t bother us because you don\'t just have to offer a slightly better alternative to Bitcoin to overcome the existing network effect. You have to offer something EXTREMELY superior. And when that thing comes, yes, if it\'s compatible with Bitcoin\'s ideals, it\'s possible to hard-fork Bitcoin to incorporate whatever it offers. It\'s also possible for us to switch to it after it gets moderate success...you don\'t have to "predict" whether it will get adoption or not. Finally, the sidechain/treechain models apparently offer a way for Bitcoin holders to temporarily take advantage of an important feature in an alt-coin which isn\'t available in Bitcoin (disclaimer: I haven\'t had time to become fully educated on this topic yet.)\n\nAll in all - we have nothing to worry about from competition, in fact, the existence of anything superior to Bitcoin will make the world a much better place whether you\'re in on day zero or not, the same way Bitcoin already is.

Inflation just *doesn't* have that direct a tie to monetary base, which your last plot makes blindingly obvious.": 1, "Because 99% of the people in this sub have no idea how monetary policy and economics in general works. The last graph simply shows the expansion of the monetary base (which a lot of people here seem to be confusing with the money supply) provided by the federal reserve. They purchased securities from banks (in this case mostly mortgage backed securities and t-bills) in order to increase their liquidity. Now that these banks hold large amounts of excess reserves they're better able to provide credit to consumers. The problem is simply expanding the monetary base doesn't incentivize banks to make loans, it simply provides them with the liquidity to do so. Combine that with the fact that the federal funds interest rate is so low, banks are just sitting on reserves because it is cheap for them to do so and they aren't confident in the current and near future state of the economy to be making a lot of loans. So the solution to this problem and what the federal reserve has been doing since 08 is begin charging interest on excess reserves (at a rate of .25% which will probably go up as the economy continues to improve). This discourages banks from sitting on large amounts of reserves and encourages them to make more loans to consumers or other banks that would like to provide credit but lack the liquidity. \n\nIn short expanding the monetary base has little correlation to inflation, as it simply increases liquidity of institutions at the cost of equity. The only way this has an effect on inflation is if the banks utilize their increased reserves to make a shit ton of risky loans which increases the money supply. We can clearly see this is not happening (not that we would expect it anyways, as it would be a good way for a bank to drive itself into the ground), in fact we face the exact opposite problem. Banks are still afraid to issue credit, even though it is cheap.": 1, 'Some relevant [graphs!](http://imgur.com/a/2xnkv)\n': 46}, ('Hodl tight.

Bfx has a peer 2 peer lending / borrowing system to provide liquidity for shorts (and leveraged longs).

You pay interest on the swap you use set by the swap offerer. The chart represents the total sum of all active swaps. The green area represents all USD swaps used for long positions. The two red areas represent btc/ltc swaps used in short poisons. As it is hard to compare Btc/Ltc to USD I made a chart where the shorts are converted into USD equivalent. There are also chart displaying absolute btc/USD/ltc totals on other pages.

While there are many versions of journalism sites for Bitcoin, several podcasts for all types of alt-currencies and the like, the modum operandi of most users is to go to 3 or 4 sites, at best, and take whatever they say with complete abandon rather than double-check.\n\nThis is a *huge* problem.\n\nThere\'s this little index, which admittedly isn\'t perfect but will serve to illustrate my point, called the [Press Freedom Index](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_Freedom_Index) or PFI for short.\nIt\'s used to measure problems of diversity of information, independence of medium, versatility of points of view, etc. It\'s a good way to measure whether your journalism media is good or bad in your country. Let\'s take the country where I live, Chile, as a quick example of what would qualify as "problematic" in this system.\n\nChile has a few major journalism publications. El Sur, El Mercurio, The Clinic, El Mirador (which is online only) and Radio BioBio Chile being some of the most prominent. We also have a few national TV channels: TVN, Canal 13, Mega, Red TV and ChileVision. You may be wondering why I chose those particularly to talk about.\n\nSee, that\'s the thing. These are practically the only ones anyone gives more than five minutes of attention. There are others that exist, and are certainly filling enough of a niche with the public to warrant their continuous publication, however, they will never reach a high enough point to compete with the other ones.\n\nThese major publications are also severely (and rather insultingly so) political. Out of the 10 I mentioned above, 8 are what you could call "Right wing" owned, some of them are owned by the same people when you go into analyzing where they obtain their resources, and politicians have had stock, relatives, or complete ownership of them in the past. A quick example of this is former president Sebastian Pi\xc3\xb1era, who used to own ChileVision but had to sell it off when he entered office, though that didn\'t really take away the bias the network had for him.\n\nTo illustrate the point even further, El Mercurio is part of an enterprise called Mercurio S.A.P, which owns El Mercurio, La Estrella (a more localized paper), El Sur and El Austral, all of which are very popular papers which are read all over the country. They are also, arguably, connected to La Tercera, which is Mercurio\'s direct competition, so to speak.\n\nThe Clinic, which is one of the very few that isn\'t really that heavily interconnected to "Right Wing" tendencies, is unapologetically Leftist, and is also known mostly for very crass, borderline parody articles which are more about taking away prestige from political figures rather than understanding the problem at hand. Other journals also attempt to follow and fill this category, making a small portion that is contrary, but no less problematic.\n\nAll 17+ million chileans go for these news sources, all of which have been shown to collude, share or deny information in tandem, have the same owners and interests or have heavy political connotations that cripple their journalistic integrity over the years. This doesn\'t mean that all their journalists or all their work is for naught, but it is severely problematic in the long run either way.\nNow, let\'s take this situation into Bitcoin. \n\nConsider, for a moment, where people obtain their news sources about Bitcoin, and particularly, what the possible connections between all of them are. \n\nWe have about... I\'d like to ballpark this and say 5 major publications for Bitcoin, ranging from podcasts to youtubers to proper journalism sites, all of which have been shown to be interconnected in one way or another. Most of them have high stakes in the technology and economy of Bitcoin, thus providing a bias that is odd and yet very clear for even a passive observer. For that matter, the surnames of these people has practically become synonym with Bitcoin in several locations.\n\nWe have several which share writers and owners, all of which can also be found, from time to time, at the Bitcoin Foundation, which feels terrifyingly close to El Mercurio S.A.P, which is seen as the big head honcho of journalism down here.\n\nWe have a small, but still noticeable amount of journalists, bloggers and podcasters who board the issues of Bitcoin with more humor and parody than there really is any need for, and in many cases are overtly political with their ideals. Much alike what is going on with The Clinic at the moment. \n\nAll of these sites also see themselves in the conundrum of catering, having to go and run ads for similar, if not equal companies to what their competitors have to go for in order to sustain themselves. \n\nNow, I don\'t want to go into details, mainly because this post has gone on too long already, and some of you are smart enough to fill in the gaps yourselves. If we take Bitcoin\'s sphere of journalism by the standards of the PFI, we have a severely problematic system that requires a lot of fixing, and fast.\n\nA full disclosure as well: I am the owner and producer of a small podcast myself, and I always finish the podcast with the same idea: **Research, discuss and share whatever you find about this topic**.

CoinDesk allegedly ignores comments, is implied to be in cahoots with crooked cloud miners, censors/deletes comments for articles, profits from advertising, has faulty price index algorithms, creates Nermins aka journalists which are fictional... I could go on and on. Not a single compliment that isn\'t followed by a "but...". And this from CoinDesk, who you say you "respect"?\n \nThe alleged disservice CoinDesk does to Bitcoin is lost and will soon be the MySpace to your Facebook it seems. Although you have no income you vaguely talk of *"monetization with bitcoin enabled technology (being easier to implement than (they) would think"* and chastise cookies, email address databases, Google Analytics and the despicable practice of a media publication selling ads! But that\'s not your style! Your investors will reap the rewards of the dis-serviced CoinDesk readers; fantastic for a company two paragraphs earlier claimed it was working for no income.\n \nBut thankfully your moral compass allows you to service the richest people with the best mobile devices (you got that data from where? Google Analytics? Say it ain\'t so Mahatma!). Because the third world with their poor cities, 3G non-smart phones - the unbankable - why on Earth would Bitcoin\'s potential apply to the country of Africa? But I digress, you have no proof of any accusations, but surely your background is in the scope of arguing this. It\'s not like astronauts who are actors; you\'ve got to have some credentials, so let\'s hear your wisdom\'s genesis and nurturer; what are your credentials?\n \n**"I am not a journalist** *and my company wasn\xe2\x80\x99t even founded to be media outlet"* - agh, ok, go on: *"but it happened to be an easy thing to do and it supports our more important R&D efforts."*\n \nPhew! Thank god it\'s not for the integrity, but for your *"more important R&D costs"!*\n*"We made a decision to do it with integrity and I hope we can hold ourselves to this standard always."*\nI\'m lost.\n*"We have also made mistakes..."* Oh, mistakes! I\'m glad you recognize these things happen. Sometimes sources get misquoted, or the source is a liar (CNN are just as guilty for reporting OJ Simpson was innocent?), and sometimes, people have no info if sources or proof, which is where we can agree - people who report in a manner emulating journalists but have no facts to back their opinions, or require disclaimers in the heading, are low-lifes. So tell me about these pieces of evidence you have disproving the alleged fake CoinDesk journalist\'s report...\n \n*"how he got them (the photos/quotes), I don\xe2\x80\x99t know and if they are real I don\xe2\x80\x99t know."*\nAnything else?\n*"I have suspicions about (their) practices and social media followers, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t have the data to say anything."*\nCmon, give me something here!\n*"I have noticed and documented issues with his reporting over the past year and a half, but in business you should never speak bad about a competitor, so I bit my tongue."*\n \nThat takes character. That seems at odds with your "theses" though.... how can you rationalize this?\n*"We are tiny compared to (CoinDesk) and do not have access to (their) resources."*\n \nOh my.\n \nLet\'s report on your open-letter calling for community boycott of your competitor shall we?\n \n*"Your reporting is not accurate, how can I trust your data?"* you ask Coindesk. I often trust the time on the TV even if CNN fudges the facts. It\'s math. But proof is not something you have much of. Can I ask you, likewise; *"Your reporting is not accurate, how can I trust your data?"*\n \nOh and you believe cloud mining is a scam? Based on what? Proof? Or is it proof that may turn out less black and more gray as details emerge? Because journalists acting on information usually can\'t give a post-mordem dissection. They have sources, they report the news, and then you come by and point out how clear your 20/20 Hindsight vision is? But you\'re not a journalist. You\'re a cancer to Bitcoin growth. Your yearnings for new world order are not welcomed by me. Nor Nermin, I assume. But I\'m just glad you\'ve got so much integrity to remain anonymous while you call the plays from your quarterback armchair. \n\nIf you love Bitcoin then do something for it; realize your chance of winning an all out war on fiat and banking systems and privacy may be slightly less favorable than introducing technology without the diatribe. I think you need a reality check. Pull your head out of the chat rooms and see the responses average Joes have to your anarchistic machinations. I assure you, Joe doesn\'t want a new world order, no more than I want a Bitcoin fundamentalist zealot assuring me salvation lies in the hearts of the good people of the "Bitcoin community" and that he\'s keeping the conglomerate Goliath honest. *"Nothing is more important than code hygiene and accurate data when it comes to bitcoin."* ED: Also: *"Don\xe2\x80\x99t forget, both gold and bitcoin are open source."* ([author](http://web.archive.org/web/20140406235231/http://www.ihavebitcoins.com/featured/bitcoin-versus-gold/)\nUh, huh.\n \nYou want cloud hashing miners punished? And it\'s CoinDesk\'s job? After all, journalists pushing regulatory practices and risking law suits isn\'t what you volunteered! Oh no! That\'s CoinDesk\'s job! If the "community" backs you you\'re right, if not you say you\'ll apologise for being wrong. The community disagrees and you\'re wrong? What?\n \nBut we\'re off topic; because this is just a veil for your self-appointed noble quest to send an open letter (vs, you know, like email) to decry ethics, and honor and everything else you have none of. An angry, little man who hides behind half-remembered libertarian quotes (and possibly a few unopened boxes of [Seroquel](http://www.seroquelxr.com/) is all you are and I think you should accept that whatever your business is, it\'s bound to fail.\n \nWhat is your company, if I may ask?
