It\'s actually much more serious than that.\n\nYou see, generally the the easiest way for an adversary to compromise the security of a cryptosystem like OpenPGP isn\'t to crack the cryptography itself, obviously. What\'s much, much easier is to simply **impersonate** the source of some signatures or messages, by using a keypair that the adversary generated and controls. Anybody (even you!) can open up GPG and create a key pair that claims to be owned by the Electrum developer(s), with their email address and everything. The only difference is will be the key data itself - and the fact that the adversary controls the private key. This can even be done by software automatically, on the fly, as a download is being transmitted over the internet!\n\nSo, in this case, if the adversary wanted you to run a compromised version of Electrum, all they have to do is alter the file on the download source to their own, malware version, or otherwise redirect the link to their modified copy. If they can do this (and many of us know how frequently websites can be hacked in such ways, or how simple it is for a VPN, proxy, Tor Exit Node, or even another person using the same WiFi connection as you can alter the website contents you might see), then it\'s a simple matter of replacing not justr the Electrum download, but **also** the signature and public key that are provided - with ones generated by the adversary, to make the download *appear* legitimate. In such a case, you might download Electrum, try to "verify" the signature, and be prompted that you need the associated public key (with a particular ID or fingerprint). So, you then go back to the website, or fetch the relevant public key from a keyserver, import the key, and then the signature from "Animazing" verifies "perfectly!"\n\n...The only problem is, **that** "Animazing" is actually the NSA - or perhaps a cybercriminal.\n\nThis is the classic "Man-In-The-Middle" attack, and it is a very serious problem - and very difficult to solve. It exists in more or less the same form for almost every single kind of communications security in the world, from OpenPGP to HTTPS to TextSecure and so on.\n\nHTTPS "solves" it by having Certificate Authorities that attest to which keys are actually legitimate for certain websites, though this relies on the CAs being trustworthy and immune to hacking. OpenPGP systems, on the other hand, decentralize this process, and use the [Web of Trust](http://www.rubin.ch/pgp/weboftrust.en.html). This can be much better for security, but counts on the users to do a great deal more in order to achieve that security, like sign each other\'s GPG keys, and even participate in some [keysigning parties](http://www.cryptnet.net/fdp/crypto/keysigning_party/en/keysigning_party.html) (which can be a lot of fun!).\n\nHowever, some assurances can be gained by comparing the Fingerprint of a provided public key from multiple sources and over multiple media. For instance, here is a signed statement of the fingerprints that **I** have for ThomasV and Animazing\'s keys:\n\n    -----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----\n    Hash: SHA512\n    \n    pub   4096R/0x2BD5824B7F9470E6 2011-06-15\n          Key fingerprint = 6694 D8DE 7BE8 EE56 31BE  D950 2BD5 824B 7F94 70E6\n    uid                 [ unknown] ThomasV <thomasv1@gmx.de>\n    sub   4096R/0x1A25C4602021CD84 2011-06-15\n    \n    pub   2048R/0x22453004695506FD 2013-01-15\n          Key fingerprint = 9914 864D FC33 499C 6CA2  BEEA 2245 3004 6955 06FD\n    uid                 [ unknown] Animazing <animazing@gmail.com>\n    sub   2048R/0x44D2C3E8F607BDEC 2013-01-15\n    -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\n    \n    iQIcBAEBCgAGBQJVXdtyAAoJEJdH3pe6/Nu5oGcQALp7CGqBvG65XmZ79jEG5wvi\n    jwj0oKtl52HzZSHWaMk2R0lpQFQjEs/V6zdG7iTELo90faIK2jRA+mua/agzsjsJ\n    luKfDiYy29UhOdQV20XYQHfbSyvK3+MTqQ17nUnbZb+mfi57dJOfFSTopKe9ERIO\n    U6nNTHPqAX4YYfugDfMkEZHw0j2ZwFqVUFGAKV7Y4bsm+VyZj7M11XxqL/zAkZL4\n    1hS/+w/Ee47wVjJcDSJX/+ZCsskC3KVy3CUw7LrX08OwAZlMxJjMWifCNKpPJ+/j\n    grtBON69dLCLPU62meFjiOgoVbR3yAfTJG3YjRev6k4qnZYoMxwLKTPTXiThJtA8\n    DGExG2luSzCa08IqUKscKwXV5yp4AO629r/D3k26ezpm2YrrwQ68LaNw0VslcSwv\n    Bn7a02TXIWqJxDv1TbIEkIfLgluc2j1iBkw/fR2rxSraDgt2RkKCX+k/n2mlrByS\n    KFH7TWsQbUDXP8e+PCcFIsReFQdUk+W70IV61WzMvyIO0SHP9HXAkH3/qjj7WvAu\n    M6o3qeFaSILdObvH9d+S5QugVxZKgFx1y5tAdY1OYnDnDFhlVgVLTVlFj8Qe2Gvp\n    Mc8ONvJL+k2hCPO4k6Odbw7HWIlSyHjT3Hfxo8w1cBijAyy1o2hCGUSiYz7uX34+\n    iV9Os+Ju2dtT/Xd1rqUx\n    =JayD\n    -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\n\n...But who am I, and what\'s to say that **I\'m** not working with compromised keys?

So now, our adversary would have to not only intercept the key you get from the Electrum site, but also what you might see on the HTTPS reddit and KeyBase sites - a significantly more difficult task (though not impossible!). This is still not nearly as good as a direct WoT link from you to ThomasV and Animazing, but it is probably good enough for most people\'s purposes.\n\nTL;DR: Please learn about the importance of [Key Trust](http://www.rubin.ch/pgp/weboftrust.en.html) and understand that those warnings that GPG gives you are much more serious than whether or not the signer is trustworthy or not - it might be a man in the middle!\n\n-----\n\n**EDIT:** Once you have sufficient confidence that a given public key (like Animazing\'s) in your keyring is "trusted" to you, you may Sign that key Locally with your own GPG key, to avoid being warned about it in the future, and to help ensure that it will not be substituted on your own device at a later date. On the command line, this is done like:  \n\n`gpg --lsign -u YourEmailAddress@mail.org Animazing`\n\nWhere `--lsign` signifies a **L**ocal **Sign**ing operation, that is, one that won\'t be shared with anyone else or uploaded to any Keyservers. This is your own "vouch" for the authenticity of that key, and that it does in fact belong to who it claims to belong to.\n\nThis process is also possible through GUI programs, like Seahorse, Kleopatra, Enigmail, GPA, GPGTools, etc.': 12, "If I download over https from electrum.org, doesn't this already ensure that the content provided is signed by and thus provided by electrum.org?\n\nIs there any added security in checking and trusting animazing's (third party?) signature?": 3, 'Cool\n': 1}, ('Bitcoin Balloon Giveaway, find and win \xc2\xa320 of BTC', 8): {}, ('Hierarchical deterministic Bitcoin wallets that tolerate key leakage (short paper)', 67): {'[deleted]': 1, "I haven't read the paper yet but off the top of my head it seems a major benefit would a reduction in the size of a stealth address. \n\nCurrently we have to use two keys (scan and spend) to avoid keeping the keys to the coins unencrypted. \n\nWe could derive both keys from a master public key and have the wallet store the child scan private key unencrypted but the key leakage prevents that. \n\nShould this work, we could use a single public key for stealth addresses making them much shorter.": 8, 'Aha.': 1, 'What is the m of O(m) size of a mpk?': 1, 'The use case you describe was the inspiration for payment codes.': 2, 'Coinkite emails all the master public key in plain text to every user.

In a _hierarchical deterministic (HD)_ wallet, child private keys are generated pseudorandomly from a master private key, and the corresponding child public keys can be generated by anyone with knowledge of the master public key. These wallets have several interesting applications including Internet retail, trustless audit, and a treasurer allocating funds among departments. A specification of HD wallets has even been accepted as Bitcoin standard BIP32. Unfortunately, in all existing HD wallets\xe2\x80\x94including BIP32 wallets\xe2\x80\x94an attacker can easily recover the master private key given the master public key and any child private key. This vulnerability precludes use cases such as a combined treasurer-auditor, and some in the Bitcoin community have suspected that this vulnerability cannot be avoided.We propose a new HD wallet that is not subject to this vulnerability.Our HD wallet can tolerate the leakage of up to _m_ private keys with a master public key size of _O(m)_. We prove that breaking our HD wallet is at least as hard as the so-called \xe2\x80\x9cone more\xe2\x80\x9d discrete logarithm problem.": 15, 'Any decendant ': 1, "Bullshit where's mine": 2, 'He gets a "bitcoin expert" flair.

': 4, "Is there any reason you'd want to give away the master public key?": 2, 'You get a "Paycoin Expert" flair instead. :P': 7, "Isn't that what hardened derivation is for?": 2, 'It doesn\'t-- as there are many ways a hardware wallet can have design flaws or random errors which compromise the key. Timing and power sidechannels, firmware glitches, bad nonce handling... all things that have happened in production. Eventually we\'ll see malicious hardware wallets which intentionally leak the key in the nonce-sidechannel. The important thing to keep in mind is that any HD wallet is effectively a _single_ key, and prudent key management suggests that it is not best to use a single key for everything and all time.\n\nRather, it doesn\'t give a benefit in terms of number of lost keys or data size over having just N different keys (though it does have greater flexibility in which losses it covers);  and it only covers a set-in-advance finite number of lost keys; which is why it wasn\'t previously considered interesting by people who were aware of it.\n\nThere aren\'t that many applications where you will leak one or two but will be _absolutely sure_ to not leak three (or similar). And of the cases where you would be, you could usually just use N separate chains.  That said, there probably are some applications.\n\nContrary to your suggestion, lack of interest from hardware wallet makers would likely make a BIP easier. The ideal amount of interest in a BIP is "a few parties", too many interested parties and the risk of deadlocking increases.  Though my own interest would be gated by a clear understanding of an application which is significantly improved-- at least in the version of the paper I read before I wasn\'t too excited about the applications, and the improved robustness is pretty fragile in the context of the suggested ones.\n\nOTOH, I sometimes wish I\'d specified public derivation in that way regardless-- it\'s over-used in places where it doesn\'t really provide value commiserate with the risk; if it had a minimum 4-dimension key the larger size would bias people towards using hardened keys where they could, and the extra tolerance to leakage might someday save _someones_ bacon. Now that the non-robust version is widely supported, getting people to adopt a longer pubkey string to improve their vulnerability to fringe risks that they hardly understand would be a tough sell.\n': 2, '\xf0\x9f\x92\xa9': 4, 'The same as this?  Almost but not quite; though it may be just as good for many applications.\nThere are two very different kinds of HD wallet described by BIP32.  Hardened and Public-derivable (I\'ll call PD).  Both are logically "single keys" in that loss of the master key loses the wallet.   PD has a surprising and very unwelcome additional behavior that if you lose the private key of the public children of a PD key (along with the chain code)-- e.g. by exporting it, or by using a signer with a bad nonce procedure-- then you lose it\'s master too. You can go up the chain!.   Hardened doesn\'t have this issue, but other people cannot generate pubkeys for you on your behalf with hardened.\n\nWhat this paper is about is about using N parallel PD keys such that you can leak _any_ N-1 of the child private keys without compromising the PD master.  It makes it work like the hardened but preserving public derivation so long as your leak is under the threshold.\n\nThis is better than having just N separate PD keys, in that with N separate keys leaking a single key immediately leaks 1/N of all your derived keys. It is still not as secure as hardened (esp since I think for most applications you can be confident that you\'ll leak NONE (e.g. no way to export provided) or MANY (export provided), but in between thresholds are harder to achieve.).. but it preserve the public derivation property-- which is nice, but potentially overused.\n\nI introduced the public derivation concept to address a specific use case: merchants needing to generate unique addresses from a webserver-- in order to track which users have paid-- while keeping private keys offline to prevent retroactive compromise and without needing to continually top-up the server with keys. For this application its security limitations are well worth the benefit. For other applications, the tradeoff is less clear. Unfortunately, most wallets implementing BIP32 only allow the user to use non-hardened keys.\n\nThe fact that PD is being misapplied may make schemes to make PD stronger more interesting.\n ': 3, "Why's your name have books": 2, 'At first, the problem with this scheme appears to be the need to maintain multiple private keys.

You need a lot of stamina (VC) to pull this through, and even if you do, I think you\'re way too early to approach these organisations top-down.\n\n\nTop-down... The most aggressive blockchain startup I\'ve "experienced" so far is Ripple, and they too are having difficulties getting through the doorstep:\n\n* Generally, the management level of financial institutions\'s have a weak understanding of what the blockchain can be used for, even less so colored coins. The traction the blockchain\'s gotten lately isn\'t because it\'s a neat architectural pattern, it\'s because of VC attention.\n\n* Everybody in this sector are busy meeting new regulatory rules \xe2\x80\x94 I\'ve never seen this many compliance-driven projects before. There simply isn\'t any room for anything else.\n\n\nAt least I _think_ that there\'s not one company selling blockchain solutions that can stand on it\'s own legs. I would even like to doubt anyone of them has a paying customer on any level deeper than building a proof of concept.\n\n\nThere are other ways into an enterprise than through management. If you\'re going down that road; as long as your business model is closed-source, your biggest challenge is procurement management.\n\n\nI wouldn\'t look so much at what others are doing, because so far, none of them has a track record worthy of copying.\n\n\nLastly, some constructive criticism \xe2\x80\x94 take it or leave it: In conjunction with management\'s weak understanding of the blockchain and colored coins, I would probably have a pass at your home page along with a good copywriter. I understand that you want to be general, but instead of going for every target group, you risk missing them all. I miss real world examples of what you\'re trying to solve.

Our research demonstrates that this was not the case. Using a bespoke web crawler, we downloaded all drugs listings on Silk Road in September 2013. We found that a substantial proportion of transactions on Silk Road are best characterised as \xe2\x80\x98business-to-business\xe2\x80\x99, with sales in quantities and at prices typical of purchases made by drug dealers sourcing stock. High price-quantity sales generated between 31-45% of revenue, making sales to drug dealers the key Silk Road drugs business. As such, Silk Road was what we refer to as a transformative, as opposed to incremental, criminal innovation. With the key Silk Road customers actually drug dealers sourcing stock for local street operations, we were witnessing a new breed of retail drug dealer, equipped with a technological subcultural capital skill set for sourcing stock. Sales on Silk Road increased from an estimate of $14.4 million in mid 2012 to $89.7 million by our calculations. This is a more than 600% increase in just over a year, demonstrating the demand for this kind of illicit online marketplace. **With Silk Road functioning to considerable degree at the wholesale/broker market level, its virtual location should reduce violence, intimidation and territorialism. Results are discussed in terms of the opportunities cryptomarkets provide for criminologists, who have thus far been reluctant to step outside of social surveys and administrative data to access the world of \xe2\x80\x98webometric\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98big data\xe2\x80\x99.**\n\n': 3, 'See the very first comment on the first article:\n\n>"That\'s a reasonable concern, though it didn\'t do the defense any good in court. Judge Katherine Forrest rejected the argument on a technicality during the trial, and so the defense was not allowed to explore this line of questioning."\n\n>It\'s more than just a little technicality. Ulbricht refused to state that the server that was hacked (if it was hacked) was actually his. You can\'t claim that your privacy rights were violated if you won\'t acknowledge that the search was of your property. From the linked article:\n\n>"Defendant has\xe2\x80\xa6brought what he must certainly understand is a fatally deficient motion to suppress [evidence]," the judge writes. "He has failed to take the one step he needed to take to allow the Court to consider his substantive claims regarding the investigation: he has failed to submit anything establishing that he has a personal privacy interest in the Icelandic server or any of the other items imaged and/or searched and/or seized."\n\n>That argument may seem like a Catch-22. If Ulbricht were to claim ownership of that server he might have incriminated himself. But Forrest writes that Ulbricht could have nonetheless claimed the server in a pre-trial statement that couldn\'t be used against him as evidence. "Defendant could have established such a personal privacy interest by submitting a sworn statement that could not be offered against him at trial as evidence of his guilt (though it could be used to impeach him should he take the witness stand)," she writes. "Yet he has chosen not to do so."\n\nThe comments section is full of people taking apart the claim that this was in any way a precedent, novel, or wrong.\n\nThe second article doesn\'t seem to claim any new precedents were set; it just says\n\n> We may see a lively, dramatic and precedent-setting trial.\n\nThe third article doesn\'t really say what precedents it\'s talking about, and if it\'s talking about locating the server, I already dealt with that above.': 7, "Is he asking for help researching Bitcoin, or being a service provider?

Wardell (1978a) estimated that practolol, a drug in the beta-blocking family, could save ten thousand lives a year if allowed in the United States. Although the FDA allowed a first beta-blocker, propranolol, in 1968, three years after that drug had been available in Europe, it waited until 1978 to allow the use of propranolol for the treatment of hypertension and angina pectoris, its most important indications.\n\nand\n\n>Gieringer (1985) used data on drug disasters in countries with less-stringent drug regulations than the United States to create a ballpark estimate of the number of lives saved by the extra scrutiny induced by FDA requirements. He then computed a similar ballpark figure for the number of lives lost owing to drug delay:\n\n\n>>[T]he benefits of FDA regulation relative to that in foreign countries could reasonably be put at some 5,000 casualties per decade or 10,000 per decade for worst-case scenarios. In comparison, it has been argued above that the cost of FDA delay can be estimated at anywhere from 21,000 to 120,000 lives per decade. . . . Given the uncertainties of the data, these results must be interpreted with caution, although it seems clear that the costs of regulation are substantial when compared to benefits.
