Clearly, there is precedent, based on Silk Road, that a website operator who is profiting off the sale of illegal narcotics is liable for the actions of the site\'s users. Perhaps they even show some emails where people flagged some questionable items and you took no action, thus furthering the conspiracy.\n\nFYI, this scenario isn\'t unsimilar to what is happening with FedEx right now. Is FedEx an illegal narcotrafficking organization that happens to also deliver legitimate packages, or vice versa? The Feds seem to indicate the former.\nhttp://benswann.com/fedex-indicted-on-15-criminal-counts-for-drug-trafficking/\n\nBtw, I\'m not on the "Free Ross" bandwagon. I think if the government legitimately makes its case, then Ulbricht can expect to go to jail for a very long time. A reasonable person could anticipate that this would be the result of running a site like Silk Road, and indeed, it appears that through the actions and comments Ulbricht made, he in fact anticipated that this could be a potential outcome. \n\nHowever, the methods the government used to find and bust Ulbricht (i.e. illegal hacking of a foreign server? NSA internet traffic data?) might be in question, and if legitimized through this trial, set a dangerous precedent for the use of government power in regulating the Internet. Personally, based on what we\'ve learned from the NSA, it seems that this power has no bounds. Coupled with the fact that most of our digital lives occur on someone else\'s server these days (Google, Apple, etc), and the boundless nature of federal criminal law, won\'t this make all of us criminals if the government decides we need to be?\n\nAnyway, I\'m not sure if you\'re just trolling at this point, but I think your question was legitimate, so I\'ve done my best to answer it. I do think this trial has implications for what we are allowed to do on the Internet, and the government\'s limitations on stopping us from doing those things.': 1, 'Thanks gwern!

They can\'t be fired or have their salary reduced except for gross misconduct. So theoretically, they are impartial. While you might take issue with the politics of some of these judges, in theory they are not corrupt individuals.\n\nThe truth is, I think it is our fault. We have ceded our political system to a two party duopoly that doesn\'t really differ in their fundamental approach to these things. We\'re too busy eating nachos and watching Desperate Housewives to give a fuck what is happening in our government. That is why this shit stays the same.

Accepting Apple Pay requires only that a business accept credit cards and have a working NFC terminal. Pretty much all of them already accept credit cards, and almost all of those will soon upgrade to NFC-capable terminals, if they haven\'t already. In other words, in the next couple of years, you\'ll be able to use Apple Pay pretty much everywhere. Being "cross-platform" doesn\'t matter when most businesses don\'t use iOS/Android/Windows Phone to accept payments but rather specialized POS equipment from IBM, Toshiba, etc.\n\n> Banks don\'t want to give Apple a cut of THEIR fee, Apple wants their own fee ON TOP of the regular banks\' fees.\n\nWell, no, that\'s just straight up wrong.

Find a single example of any bank raising their credit card fees to pay for Apple Pay.\n\n> I know this is hard to grasp as an Apple fan, but seriously, it\'s not the next big thing.\n\nI actually never said it was.

If 1% of miners accept transactions with essentially no fee and 99% of miners only accept transactions that are high enough to pay for their current costs plus a little profit, then at least some users will send transactions at the lower fee level to save money. But since adding just one more transaction is nearly free, the latter group of miners will constantly want to accept these cheaper transactions as well to make a little more money, and I'd expect the percentage of low-fee miners to gradually increase. So I expect the actual transaction fee to move toward the cost of adding a transaction to a block, which is almost nothing, and certainly not enough to support sufficient network security.\n\nWith very large blocks, miners need to think about rejecting transactions purely to convince people to pay more, and this probably won't end up working (as mentioned above). If miners can only include so many transactions, then this creates actual competitive demand for block space. With small blocks, miners will include the highest-fee transactions, and the fee varies only according to the demand at the time. There's no guarantee that the price arrived at through competition for block space will be correct, as it is entirely unrelated to the amount of network security that Bitcoin users need or desire. But it makes it likely that at least the most efficient miners will make a profit, which is maybe not the case with large blocks. A really conservative strategy for managing the max block size would be to keep the max block size small until we're sure that fees are high enough to support sufficient network security, and only then carefully increase the max block size.\n\nI'm actually not really worried about this, though. I think that miners will find other ways of making money, and even if the market totally fails, assurance contract donations can probably handle it well enough.\n\n> What if the the market-set block size is so big that only Google can afford to run full nodes?\n\nThis is my main objection to unlimited block sizes. Every full node must download every transaction. If normal people can't do this, then they can't be full nodes. If there aren't enough full nodes, then miners don't have any incentive to follow the rules.\n\nImprovements in the Bitcoin software/network can improve this somewhat, but this technology *doesn't exist yet*. Even the fairly well-planned methods of improving things are known to only take us so far. Making it so that full nodes don't have to download every transaction would require some sort of secure distributed verification system for transaction data, but a complete solution for this isn't yet known to computer science. Removing the max block size now because we hope that technology will expand sufficiently in the future is reckless.\n\nIt's annoying that the max block size is required, but we just have to deal with it.

Decentralized consensus doesn\'t have many of the benefits that centralized systems have and transactions sent to a decentralized network have to be worth enough to not be a DoS vulnerability to miners and full nodes. If someone wants to make 20 cent payments to someone and there is a 5 cent fee, that may be too much. The solution is to move to a centralized service (as they have now with their fiat currency) to pay them.\n\nKeeping Bitcoin decentralized is inherently expensive and decentralized currency is a luxury that only those who can afford the fee (maybe a few pennies) can enjoy. \n\nIt is unfortunate that we may not be able to give trustless currency to the poor, but at the same time it is unfortunate that we can\'t give them all iPads to make their transactions on...\n\n>What\'s the use in having Bitcoin if you can\'t use it to pay for products and services without going through a regulated, off-chain intermediary?\n\nIf the merchant accepts Bitcoins then you can pay them..

Instead, the stadium leaves the unsold seats empty.\n\nLikewise, someone unwilling to pay miner fees will go to the low-priced miner with their transaction. Of course, if they do this, the transaction might take hours to clear instead of minutes. If high-priced miners also accepted the low-priced transaction bids, then there\'d be no incentive for customers to pay higher transaction fees -- everyone could just \'wait for the last minute\' and get the low-priced unsold slots in the high-priced miner\'s transactions.\n\nThis is why, as a miner or operator of a mining pool, you set a minimum transaction fee formula, and you stick to it.': 1, "Except why would I as a user share the high-fee transaction request with the low fee miner?

The others will be left out.\nIf this does not lead to a massive civil unrest, and countries are still standing, there is no way to put labor-tax on them. The only way a govt is going to get tax income is by utility-based tax ( e.g. payment for removing trash, the internet-of-things can greatly help there), so in my view, govts should prepare with lowering or removing labor-tax and shift to utility-tax before the great transition.\nAfter this we will be having a very small govt who hopefully are not capable anymore of war mongering with printed money. a bright future may be around the corner in the end.": 3, 'To answer your fist point: IMO the ones left holding the bag are the largest holders of fiat, namely banks and forign debt holders like China.\n\nSecond point: World governments will stop waging wars as the reason behind wars in 21st century is in access to cheap money via inflation.
