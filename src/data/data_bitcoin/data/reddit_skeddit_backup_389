It gives people little to no incentive to choose government cryptos over bitcoin.  Also within 5 - 10 years bitcoin should be considerably bigger and more developed, which would mean it should be able to out compete any government crypto.\n\nThey only advantage the government might have is guaranteeing their crypto, but considering that is one of the big issues people are having with fiat, I don't foresee it being much of an advantage.

For example, for every generator, UPS, PDU, and power receptacle inside a server rack, there exists a second generator, UPS, PDU, and receptacle that is fed from an entirely separate power system. This guarantees that should one or more devices go offline, it will not impact the successful delivery of power because everything has an online backup. When done right, this is what represents a fully redundant 2N power system.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N%2B1_redundancy\n\nN+1 redundancy is a form of resilience that ensures system availability in the event of component failure. Components (N) have at least one independent backup component (+1). The level of resilience is referred to as active/passive or standby as backup components do not actively participate within the system during normal operation. The level of transparency (disruption to system availability) during failover is dependent on a specific solution, though degradation to system resilience will occur during failover.[1]\n\nhttp://supportdatainc.com/why-choose-us/fully-redundant-data-center-power\n\nN+1 Backup Generators\nOnce the power transfer switches sense a decline in power from the local utility, they automatically signal diesel-powered generators to start up and switch power flow to the generators. In the few seconds between the decline in power from the utility and switch over to our backup generators, our UPS units are supplied with power through a battery system that ensures the power supply to servers is uninterrupted.\nShould any generator fail, there are additional backup generators that kick in automatically to keep power supplies flowing. And if by any chance there is an extended power outage, on-site diesel generators can run indefinitely. Servers are fed by multiple uninterruptible power supply (UPS) units with redundant and instant failover coverage should any single UPS unit fail.\n\n\nAt the end of the day, unexpected shit happens.

By outlining the actual costs the original article is referring to, we see that they\'re just using scare tactics to inflate "the cost of powering 1.57 American households" to make it seem that Bitcoin is not viable. Something tells me there is a lot more electricity just powering ATMs in the world than there is in Bitcoin mining. This isn\'t to say that both these activities shouldn\'t continually be improved, but it\'s not a detrimental cost at present. People are still finding it a profitable activity to mine, just by virtue of mining itself. Thus they will still do it. Now, if their ability to profit were to die off tomorrow, then we\'d see a similar sharp decline in people who were still mining. So what I\'m saying is that while it is a problem, and it does cost too much, it\'s not a problem that can\'t be solved. It\'s not a problem like the original article is saying it\'s a problem. There are many things which we once lived without which use more electricity than 1.57 American households.

While you can loan bitcoin there\'s little incentive to do so because of the deflationary effect of price. So don\'t loan money, but do loan assets.\n\nOne example that many have drummed up before:\n\nPurchasing large assets like a house without borrowing would become tricky, but not impossible. It would have to be done with a different type of contract similar to "rent-to-own" rather than a mortgage contract. Except most of those "rent to own" contracts today doesn\'t work because they don\'t give partial ownership of the house, which is where scams happen, and laws allow the scam to be legal.\n\nBut assume rent to own is legal, and well protected by law from scams, and you can own a portion of the house. Then the time-money valuation is irrelevant because you temporarily own the house from nothing - the same as making a mortgage loan from a bank using FRB style \'money multiplying\'. If you can\'t pay the rent, then you take it to court to resolve ownership by selling it to a new owner, who will pay out a rent-to-own a % to each owner of the house. Or the original owner can opt to buy it back at a different rate depending on contract.\n\nIf you pay your rent, you\'ve paid a settlement to a % of the house.\n\nYou can still do ordinary rent if you don\'t want to buy, and I would presume it would simply involve paying less than the market rate of a buy-to-rent.': 1, 'Any larger, or too large for the average person to download... Would banks censor your spends with 1.01 MB blocks?': 1, "> Mortgage contracts just don't work with a deflationary currency\n\nQuite simply not true.": 1, "For what reason? To mine empty blocks on the headers? That's just as bad for other reasons.": 1, 'Exactly. Only thing is . . . \n\n> Bank is free to loan out your deposit and do whatever else with it.\n\nBanks don\'t loan out deposits and they don\'t need deposits to make loans. When a bank gives you a loan, say of $100,000, they simply say, "Now we owe you $100,000." That\'s it, no actual money is transferred or dealt with and they don\'t need any money to say they owe you.\n\nOf course, cash is helpful to have in case account holders ask for it, but most cash doesn\'t come from deposits anyway. Cash comes mainly from central banks printing it and giving it to the private banks. And, in fact, most deposits are just the transfer of IOUs from one person\'s bank account into another person\'s bank account. That is what happens when you use a credit card, for instance. \n\nPeople consider banks\' promises to pay money (i.e., the money "in" your bank account) to be just as good as money itself. That number on your computer screen that shows you have $23,001 dollars in your bank account (and really means the bank owes you $23,001) is considered to be the same thing as $23,001 in cash. And other people will accept payment in the form of these bank IOUs, it isn\'t as if you need to turn your bank IOUs into cash whenever you intend to pay someone. So when a bank just types in a new number into someone\'s account -- i.e., gives that person a loan -- it is effectively creating money.\n\nIf banks find they are lending so much money that the amount of money they owe people dramatically exceeds the amount of cash they have on reserve, they simply call up the central bank and the central bank sends them more cash. \n\nSo the days when private banks needed deposits in order to do stuff with that money are long gone, that\'s not how modern banking works. ': 2, "Yeah that's a pretty huge problem. Usually, Greece (and Italy, Spain, Portugal) would've devalued their currency with slightly above average Euro-zone inflation, making it cheaper and thus more attractive for tourists. That aim runs completely counter to Germany's trade surplus of $250 billion, which benefits massively from a strong euro. \n\nCurrently tourism is about 18% of Greece's GDP. The measures that the other Euro-countries want Greece to introduce (increased VAT) is just malicious. I'm not surprised negotiations ran aground on that point. ": 1, '> Bank deposits are bank\'s money.\n\nOnly a small fraction of it, since a bank uses the money coming in to pay their own obligations (customer requesting cash, borrowings from the central bank and other banks). When you deposit $1,000 with a bank, the next guy in line requesting $1,000 from his deposit might get the very same bills you just gave to the teller before. Banks are required to keep only a small reserve. Essentially this system is a shell game, where cash is used as a medium to transfer deposits. If all customers requesting a payout of their deposits, even every sound bank will go bankrupt in no time, since the reserves are way smaller than the sum of all deposits - the classic bank run.\n\n> Bank is free to loan out your deposit and do whatever else with it.\n\nCommercial banks do not loan out deposits, they create credit from collateral. If you get a car loan, the bank simply increases the balance on an account and they get the title in return. The money is then transferred to the car dealer. If the car dealer has an account with the same bank, the bank does not need even cash. If the dealer has an account with another bank or wants cash, the bank needs reserves with the central bank (redeemable for cash) or cash in the vault. Cash in the amount of the loan will leave the bank, but all other banks are doing the same: creating loans and paying them out, so cash from other banks or cash deposits come in too. In average the net cash outflows are only a small fraction of the loans - cash that remains in circulation. Of course there are rules and regulations, how much a bank is allowed to create, they need a certain amount of deposits and reserves for it, but essentially the banks inflate the money supply by creating loans. You can see that when tracking the monetary aggregates (e.g. M2-M0, deposits which come back from loans are growing). When a loan is paid back, the bank reduces the amount from its balance sheet, they "destroy" the credit, which they created some time before. If demand for loans is growing, the money supply inflates, if the demand for loans is shrinking the money supply deflates (what the central banks are fearing and fighting).': 12, 'Delays on the order of a few seconds can eat up the entire profit margin of a miner.': 2, '>Bank deposits are bank\'s money. No longer yours. You have a claim on your deposits which the bank has to pay when presented. But that\'s the little bit people forget, they think they have "their own" money in the bank. They don\'t.

Bank is free to loan out your deposit and do whatever else with it.\n\nWhat you\'re describing is called counter party liability. \n\nBut bitcoin isn\'t immune, if you don\'t have electricity and Internet you can\'t transact.

The situation now is that there were these economic ties put into place on the surface with no promise of actual underlying support between the players should anything like this go wrong, so now we see Germany acting in its own best interest because it simply doesn't want to carry the rest of the EZ, in particular Greece, anymore.\n\nThis cannot work long term.

The rupiah has become one of Asia\xe2\x80\x99s worst-performing currencies this year, depreciating around 7% against the dollar.\nENLARGE\n\nBank Indonesia says the prohibition against foreign currency in domestic transactions is intended to reduce reliance on the dollar and other foreign currencies and mitigate against capital outflows. According to Bank Indonesia, transactions within the country in currencies other than rupiah amount to $73 billion a year.\n\nPrices for all goods and services will need to be quoted in rupiah only, a measure that will affect prices for hotels, rents and professional services, such as legal advice, insurance and accounting. For instance, around 80% of office rents are paid in U.S. dollars.\n\nCompanies fear they will be forced to bear the cost of the rupiah\xe2\x80\x99s volatility and haven\xe2\x80\x99t been given enough time to set up new accounting mechanisms. As is often the case with Indonesian regulations, the law empowering the ban was passed several years ago but implementation has only been announced over the past three months.\nAdvertisement\n\nBill Sullivan, a legal adviser to the mining, oil and gas sectors at Jakarta-based law firm Christian Teo Purwono, said companies are being forced to rapidly put in place complicated arrangements, adding to their costs.\n\nThe shift comes at a time when President Joko Widodo\xe2\x80\x99s government is struggling to draw investment to help fund infrastructure projects that are badly needed in this Southeast Asian nation of 250 million people. Economic growth has hit a six-year low and confidence in the current government\xe2\x80\x99s ability to manage economic policy has slumped.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can only implement this policy when the exit rate risk is relatively small,\xe2\x80\x9d said Muhamad Chatib Basri, a former finance minister and chairman of the Mandiri Institute, a research think tank affiliated with state-owned Bank Mandiri.\n\nPeter Jacobs, a spokesman for the central bank, said Bank Indonesia would consider allowing companies more time to put the rule into effect on a project-by-project basis.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf there are corporations that have concerns about transactions about any problems related to this, they can write us a letter and we\xe2\x80\x99ll see the possibility to give them a delay,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\nThe regulation, introduced in April, included exemptions such as export and import transactions and international financing where the lender and borrower are in different countries. Legal advisers say the rules lacked clarity and left companies with questions about what exemptions might apply to them. The bank issued a subsequent circular earlier this month, but hasn\xe2\x80\x99t granted any delays.\n\nAffected businesses say they are trying to minimize the impact of the regulation by building in market-based adjustments to help offset the rupiah\xe2\x80\x99s volatility. Some property companies are considering a dollar-linked rupiah rate that changes with each billing cycle.\n\nMr. Sullivan anticipates that equipment suppliers and others will increase their prices in rupiah to account for the risk of depreciation. That won\xe2\x80\x99t be good for those needing those services at a time when industries such as mining and oil and gas are increasingly worried about costs, he says.\n\nA person familiar with the negotiations said companies aren't necessarily opposed to the regulation, but they need less of a \xe2\x80\x9clight switch\xe2\x80\x9d conversion and a more staged implementation. Others say gray areas need clarification and that there needs to be a better understanding of how penalties will be enforced.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBasically, we support the Bank Indonesia policy, but we need guidance from them for the existing contracts,\xe2\x80\x9d said Budi Setiadi, vice president for government regulations at PetroChina, a state-owned Chinese firm with several oil and gas blocks in Indonesia.

The bank has been examining use case scenarios where a large bank like Citi can transact with smaller local banks without worrying about risk or requiring cash collateral and performing immediate FX transactions.\n\n\nThis exists already, and it\'s called Ripple.

When I did that I thought of two things. First I thought of how Bitcoin is direct, cutting out countless middlemen. All of those middlemen have to drive to work, run heat or AC, use electricity in their offices, executives to fly around on private jets. A quick Google search told me VISA employed more than 8,000 people directly in 2008. That doesn't include all the staff at banks (call centers, compliance departments). To get the real carbon spent on a transaction you would need to account for many more things. You may possibly even include things like printing and shipping plastic cards and the extra receipt paper it takes to print duplicates for stores to retain a signed copy.\n\n\nThe second thing I thought of is how we are shifting from burning fossil fuels to more renewable resources on a global scale. In the decades to come energy is going to become more abundant and much cleaner. To me this is not a theory but a fact. If you wanted to start your own research on this a great place would be to read Abundance by Peter Diamandis & Steven Kotler.
