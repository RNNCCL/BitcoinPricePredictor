You go to a large room full of people, some of which want to buy snickers, and some of which want to sell snickers. Everybody takes out a small piece of paper and writes the value that they are willing to sell/buy their snickers for. Then, you place all the buyers on the left side of the room, and the sellers on the right side of the room, and sort each group into a line by the price on their piece of paper. When finished, the buyers form a sorted line with the guy willing to buy for the most at the front of the line (Sellers will obviously favor this guy since he's willing to pay the most). The guy at the front of the sellers line is willing to sell for less than all of the other sellers, so the buyers will obviously favor him first. \n\nNow, lets say the first buyer (offering highest price) is willing to pay $1.00 for a snickers bar, and the first seller (offering lower price) is willing to sell a snickers bar for $1.10. There is a *spread* of 10 cents here, and nothing happens until either a seller gets tired of waiting for his desired price and walks over to the front of the buyers line and sells to him at his price, or a buyer gets tired of waiting and walks over to the sellers line and buys at the sellers price. \n\nNow, imagine that some dude friggin loves Snickers bars, and he doesn't really give a damn what price he pays, he just needs $1000 worth of snickers NOW. So he goes to the front of the sellers line, buys all that dudes snickers for the cheapest possible price ($1.10), then moves up to the next guy who is selling at a slightly higher price ($1.15), buys all his snickers and proceeds to move his way up the line. What is happening to the price at which one can now buy snickers? It's shooting up very fast because some guy keeps buying them at higher and higher prices, leaving only the dudes in the back of the sellers line who were selling for much higher.\n\nNow, the sellers farther back in the line see this crazy guy buying up the line, so some of them take out their pencils and erase their original price, replacing it with one much higher, hoping that the buyer will keep buying and eventually buy their snickers at an even higher price and make more money. \n\nThe crazy snickers dude eventually stops buying and the sellers are now selling snickers at $5.00 a pop for the cheapest offering at the front of the line. Now imagine what would happen if this guy turned around and sold all his snickers to the buyers in like manner. The price would drop as he eats up each buyers offer in the line and works his way to the back of the line where buyers are only willing to pay $.10 for a snickers bar. \n\nThe key point here is that the current price for any good is simply the last price at which it was bought or sold in a market where people are able to choose whatever price they desire.

Let me know if I say something dumb.\n\nTo operate a full node, we could require the operator to send an arbitrary amount of Bitcoin to a time-lock transaction. Let's say we choose 0.1BTC. The operator sends the 0.1BTC to an address under his control. However, the coins are only spendable after, let's say, 1 year. \n\nThe transaction contains an IP address, declaring which node is making the payment. When our clients connect to a node, the node sends us a signed message using the key to the time-lock transaction, and we can check that their IP address matches in the blockchain. This method ensures a node operator cannot use a single payment to fund infinite nodes just by sharing their private key to all their nodes. We can ensure that their is 1 payment for every node. Bringing thousands of nodes online to attack the network would require a ton of Bitcoins, so this would be very expensive. Currently, it doesn't cost anything to launch such an attack.\n\nWe would need a special transaction type for nodes to declare a payment and IP, so that it's easy for a client to search the Blockchain for valid IP nodes just by filtering that transaction type. It doesn't matter if the operator tries to double spend the payment, because our clients will check the balance of the address containing their IP. If the money disappears, we don't connect to the node.\n\nIf a node's IP needs to be changed, then they would just declare the change with a new transaction (without having to pay again). All that matters is that a node only has a single IP address, it doesn't matter how often they want to change it.\n\nIf an attacker tries to gain a large number of nodes to attack & devalue Bitcoin, they would be destroying their own node investment, because they can't sell those locked coins.

I.e. there is a massive difference between Linden dollars, Starbucks points and Airmiles when compared to a decentralized system.  \n\nVirtual currencies have been around since the first internet games and their centralized nature means they are of no credible use in business value transfer.  Digital currencies are however and they are not confined to the virtual community like the original virtual currency definition stated.  A Casascius coin is an extreme example how bitcoin still holds value outside of the bitcoin network.\n\n\n\nSecondly, I\'d disagree with this statement "*Indeed, M3 might be a better reference, given that M1 as a definition of a country\xe2\x80\x99s money supply focuses on the role of money as a means of exchange, whereas virtual currencies are hardly used for payments at all.*"\n\nBitcoin is clearly an M0/MB valuation as it is the base/finite resource where all units can be accounted for *without any fractional banking*.  Interestingly the ECB doesn\'t appear to publish this M0/monetary base value for the euro.\n\n\nTo obtain a Bitcoin M1 valuation would be meaningless since bitcoin banks (places that hold a persons private keys and therefore that client\'s funds) have no obligation on any reserve rate.  Going back to my original point, a bitcoin bank that practised fractional banking would move from using a tangible digital currency to a virtual one for use at only that particular bank.  Here they can quote whatever valuation they like since they control their own worthless currency now as long as all their clients don\'t ask for their money back.  \n\n': 22, 'Thinking inside the box:\n\n> However, a major incident with VCS and a subsequent loss of trust in VCS could also\nundermine users\xe2\x80\x99 confidence in electronic payment instruments, in e-money and/or in specific\npayment solutions.\n\nThat\'s kind of a bold statement from an entity where its president noted: \n"Within our mandate, the ECB is ready to do whatever it takes to preserve the euro.
