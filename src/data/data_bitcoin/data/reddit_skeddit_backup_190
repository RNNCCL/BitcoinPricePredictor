Because everybody responds with something that I consider to be inapplicable.\n\nBasically bitcoin can either be a peer-to-peer payment system forever, or it can be what we\'ve been hyped up to believe it could be. A replacement for the current financial industry. \n\nThe financial industry has all kinds of products and services. Escrow. Accounting. Mortgage. Stocks. Banking. Investments. You name it.\n\nThese are mature industries. They are mature products and services. They\'ve got sometimes millions of customers. They\'ve got feature sets that are extremely varied and unique. They need to do a lot of different "things".\n\nReally in my opinion the biggest problem facing bitcoin right now is this question: is bitcoin going to be a peer-to-peer payment system or is it going to replace the finance industry? So what\'s the next step? You ask if it\'s even capable of doing all the things these mature services need it to do. And it can\'t. So the next step is asking: what about on the layer above? Side chains. Well there\'s nobody building anything. \n\nBitcoin is suitable as a peer-to-peer payment system. But it\'s being looked at by mature players in the finance industry and being found lacking. Not just as far as speed. But also features. Functionality. Flexibility. The things they need to do, to carry out their business. \n\nSupposedly there could be an entire industry of financial products and services on the layer above bitcoin. But nobody\'s doing jack shit. We\'ve got coinbase. And Bitpay.  Etc.  Lightning.  MasterCoin was supposed to do this.  It was a flop.  Counterparty isn\'t doing anything interesting as far as I can see.  BitWage is the closest thing I can think of to what I\'m referring to. A payroll service. On the Blockchain. Why aren\'t there 1000 more of these start ups right now? It\'s been seven years.\n\nThe bottom line is this: if we have any hopes for Bitcoin to stay relevant in the finance industry as more than a peer-to-peer payment system, shit better start moving quickly. Otherwise it\'s going to get passed up. And it\'s going to remain nothing more than a peer-to-peer payment system. \n\nI\'m not trying to make Bitcoin something that it\'s not. But people need to stop talking about it taking over banks, and replacing the evil corrupt finance system. Because that\'s a bunch of bullshit. It can\'t do that. Physically it wasn\'t made to do that. And I would have some hope that it could take over finance if somebody was actually doing\xe2\x80\xa6 Anything\xe2\x80\xa6 On the layer above. But nobody is. So it\'s not going to take over finance at this rate. So we need to stop saying that altogether. It\'s setting expectations that will never be met.\n\nThat\'s my point. That\'s why I keep complaining and kicking and screaming here. Everybody says "chill out, we\'ve got plenty of time". Well if we wanted to replace the financial system, we don\'t have plenty of time.

Our transaction is 500 bytes.  What is the minimum fee the transaction should pay for a rational miner to include it?\n\n>* 500 B / 1,000,000 Bps = 0.0005 sec added to time to send block to 1 peer.\n\n>* Better send to 8 peers at least to make sure you aren't sending to a malicious node.  0.0005 s X 8 = 0.004 extra sec to propagate.\n\n>*  Extra 0.004 sec means a 0.004 s / 600 s = 0.000667% increase in orphan rate.\n\n>*  0.00000667 X 25 BTC per block = 0.00016670 BTC is your expected long term loss from including a 500 byte transaction.\n\n>*  A 500 byte transaction should pay a 16,700 satoshi fee for a miner with 8Mbps upload to include it, or 33,400 satoshi per kB.\n\n>Interestingly, this minimal fee cuts in half along with the halvings.  This calculation makes the assumption that you are sending your block to 8 peers, when in reality miners are using a relay network amongst themselves to cooperatively decrease their orphan rates, which I assume is why we see an average transaction fee much lower than that.  \n\n>Is there anything wrong with this calculation?\n\n>Edit:  Bitcoin Core's default behavior as far as I know is to upload to all connected peers simultaneously rather than 1 at a time.  Would doing them 1 at a time be better for miners or does it work out to the same propagation time when accounting for the whole network?\n\nIt's also important to note that orphan blocks do not decrease mining revenue as a whole. They decrease an individual miner's revenue. For every block that is orphaned another is accepted, so a high orphan rate won't impact mining revenue of the industry.

So your new transaction, paying fee *x* will want to be greater than *p(25+nf)*. But *f* is greater than *x* too (assuming you include transactions in fee order, and ignoring different size transactions), so *f* is greater than *p(25+nf)*, and rearranging gives *f* greater than *25p/(1-np)*.\n\nMaybe more interesting, it also gives *n* less than *1/p-25/f*. Plugging in p=0.004/600, and f=17500 satoshi (current prices from statoshi.info), n has to be less than 7143, which means blocks should be under about 3.5MB. More fees would justify bigger blocks, but the relationship isn't linear -- small increases in (average) fees rapidly increase the number of transactions that are worth including under this framework, up to a maximum of 150k transactions (75MB blocks) -- transmitting a 75MB block at 8Mbps takes 1m15 though, and doing it to 8 peers takes 10 minutes, so the analysis has probably already broken down at that point...\n\nI think weak blocks improves things by a factor proportional to how much easier it is to find a weak block -- ie, if you've got a 15/16 chance of finding a weak block that includes the additional transaction before the real block, you've only got about 1/16th the chance of your block being orphaned due to the extra transaction that you would have had without weak blocks.\n\nI'm not sure if you can reason about IBLT in this framework.

I do not like RBF at all.  I have been happily, successfully accepting bitcoin in my business for 2 years now.  I've never had a problem.  No double spends, no malleability issues, no stuck transactions.  Just a smooth business process.  \n\nWe have signs up indicating we accept bitcoin and this has led to many discussions with people wanting to know more.  I have introduced quite a few new users to bitcoin and had some interesting debates.  People want to use their bitcoin and we are one of the few places in Thailand where they can do it.  Some people have traveled from Bangkok, a two hour drive, just to spend bitcoin with us.\n\nAs a retailer I know that accepting 0 conf transactions is essential.  A 10 to 30 minute wait to accept a payment is totally 100% not viable.  The very small risk of a double spend is easy for me to accept.  It has never happened so far and we have done hundreds of transactions, most people would not know how to do one and even if they did would not wish to rip us off.  \n\nRBF changes all that.  Now anyone can easily initiate a double spend and quite likely pull it off.  Obviously this is going to impact us negatively.\n\nThe argument that bitcoin is not a good vehicle for retailers is rubbish.  It has been a great vehicle for us and just our small business has introduced many new people to bitcoin and generated plenty of new business through bitcoin.  Why would anyone want to destroy that.  \n\nI have been introducing bitcoin to new merchants and almost have a POS provider here convinced to include bitcoin.  Explaining the risks that RBF creates is a deal killer.  Imagine explaining to a new merchant that the customer can just resend a new transaction and send the money back to themselves after they leave the premises. \n\nPeople can get a bit lost when I explain bitcoin as it was before RBF but once they see how simple it is in action are usually OK.  Telling them that they will have to be cautious about RBF transactions, use software than can see them coming, reject customers who send them, possibly have to explain to customers why they are unacceptable, get the customer to send another rbf transaction to reclaim the bitcoin and then resend a non-RBF transaction to pay . . .  Well that is not going to happen is it.  It will place bitcoin directly in the too hard basket for most people.\n\nMy big selling point to merchants is simplicity, no charge backs, no fees and no fuss.  RBF completely destroys my pitch.  Our staff who handle bitcoin transactions know what to do to accept the payments.  They have no knowledge of how it really works though.  They just do step 1, step2, step 3, done.  There is no way they could understand RBF and how to mitigate the danger or what to do about it.\n\nI have an open mind to lightning and side chains and will happily implement them if they work through a simple process.  Right now they don't even exist and are clearly not an option so why the hell are we destroying a major use case for bitcoin (retailers).  I just don't get it and I am very pissed off about it.\n\nMy strategy (as you asked) is to continue as we are accepting 0 confs.

A zero-conf tx and the tx spending it can both get mined in the same block and it's not an issue.\n\nSo you don't need to wait for a confirmation before spending money.  However, some wallets will block you from doing it, so that you don't try to spend double-spends or other transactions that will never confirm.\n\nAnd some merchants (or other recipients) will not consider the payment as having gone through until you get a confirmation.  For example, most exchanges don't credit your account until 3 or 4 confirmations, to protect themselves against double spend attacks.\n\nOn the other hand, some merchants and services accept 0-conf just fine -- Bitpay for example clears the payment immediately, and whenever you pay somebody who uses Bitpay as their payment processor, you see that Bitpay marks it as paid as soon as the transaction gets broadcast.\n\nSo the technically correct answer is you can spend a 0-conf transaction right away... but the practical real world answer is it depends on your wallet software and who you're sending the money to, and how they deal with 0-conf transactions.

It is called "notional" because it is exactly that - fictitious. It will never swap hands. To illustrate this, here\'s how a simple interest rate swap would work.\n\nBank A wants protection in case interest rates rise. Bank B is willing to bet that they won\'t. To bet on this outcome, they agree that, once a quarter, they will "swap" (hence the name) interest rate payments on a notional value (typically $100k by default). Bank A pays bank B a fixed interest rate on that notional 100k - let\'s pretend 3% - while bank B pays bank A the average LIBOR rate of the last 30 days before payment day.\n\nSo, every quarter, banks A and B get together. They take that $100k notional value, multiply it by the interest rates, and then that\'s their payment to each other. Let\'s pretend that LIBOR is at 1%, while the fixed rate is 3%. \n\nBank A pays $100k x 3% - aka $3k - to bank B. Bank B pays $100k x 1% - aka $1k - to bank A. Total net change is $2k. Bank B is winning.\n\nLet\'s pretend that LIBOR rises to 5%.\n\nBank A pays $100k x 3% - aka $3k - to bank B. Bank B pays $100k x 5% - aka $5k - to bank A. Bank A is now winning.\n\nWhat you\'re doing is counting the notional value. Let\'s pretend Goldman has 50 such contracts. You\'re saying "Goldman is exposed to $5 million in derivative deals!" But that number has no meaning in a risk sense, because the bank will never, ever, pay the full notional value. It never changes hands.
