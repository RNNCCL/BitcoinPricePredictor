We've had a surge in interest the past 24hrs. \n\n- From our perspective, a zero-trust model is still an abstract. We've presented an intuitive TTP oracle service that is only used in the case of default (< 10%), in which we use the XBX 2-HR TWAP as an independent reference rate to calculate settlement. The other 90% of the time the counterparties can settle independently. We hope this will help to make the case for using oracles in general (TTP or distributed). We believe there's a huge opportunity for TTP oracles in the future, but we also acknowledge that the TTP oracle model is not for everyone. Our target customers are mostly commercial / institutional clients, so the TTP model works for them.\n\n- We're waiting for the market to create an appropriate system architecture for the robust ecosystem of (distributed) oracles. We're still supporters of the Codius project and like what Bitrated is doing (personally, I've been an Bitrated agent for the past several months). We're also very excited about OpenBazaar's proposed oracle service. We try to stay as informed as possible with the latest oracle projects and plan to support integration with those distributed models as best we can, especially if the demand is there. \n\n- Thanks. We started Hedgy based on first principles. To us, the forward contract represents that first principle with respect to OTC markets. As far as the product roadmap goes, we're currently working on an API that will help us listen to our users better. Bitcoin volatility is still a major problem and we believe we can help commercial entities solve that problem with smart contracts. Beyond bitcoin, we see a lot of opportunities to introduce the smart contract oracle method as a solution to counterparty risk in the FX and P2P lending markets.\n\n- As far as other oracle entities goes for us to be measured against, I mentioned a few organizations above that have taken a more distributed approach. Our friends at Mirror now seem to also be working on a TTP oracle service for OTC trading. Again, we try to stay informed on market developments as best we can, but it's hard to keep track. Please let us know of any other companies/entities working on oracle projects that we haven't yet mentioned.\n\nAppreciate the questions!": 1, "This seems different from the usual idea of a smart contract, which requires a robust ecosystem of oracles to avoid centralization risk in determining the truth.

I find a counterparty and set up a forward contract to sell 2 bitcoin at $1000/bitcoin 30 days from now on Hedgy.\n\n- How much would I deposit into the 2-of-3 multisig?\n- How many dollars would my counterparty deposit with Hedgy (or some other third party)?\n- If my counterparty didn't pay the full $2000 as deposit, how will I get my full $2000 if the exchange rate declines and the counterparty refuses to pay the difference?\n- If Hedgy goes under or loses the counterparty deposit before the contract expiration, what are my options?\n\n": 3, "1) You're mixing up losses due to uncollateralized exposures and losses (or lack thereof) due to collateralized exposures. Funnily enough, Lehman went bankrupt because non-mark-to-market assets (subprime ABS) were matched on the liability side with short-term collateralized borrowings. Had Lehman's liabilities been unsecured/uncollateralized in nature (and long enough in their maturity), it might not have gone under.\n\n2) BNYM is a tri-party repo agent.

See my responses to your questions below.\n\n- We require at least 30% deposit of the notional value in bitcoin (BTC) from each counterparty (ie: 2.0 BTC would need at least 0.6 BTC margin)\n- We don't take custody of fiat, but your counterparty would directly wire you the $2,000, once you've delivered the 2.0 BTC to your multi-sig smart contract (in addition to the 0.6 BTC). We provide notifications when funding of BTC is delivered, but counterparties must independently verify delivery of fiat. \n- Smart contracts cannot be independently executed without at least 30% margin in BTC. If your counterparty were to fail to deliver the $2,000 wire transfer at contract expiry, then this would be a case of default in physical delivery. You would then request net settlement and the counterparty's margin (in BTC) would be awarded to you to make up for the change in the exchange rate. This method helps to reduce counterparty risk.\n- If Hedgy goes under, then counterparties can use their mnemonic passphrase to settle their contract(s) independent of Hedgy.\n\nHope that answers your questions!": 2, 'No specific expert on Lehman but within the financial system (i.e. all their deals with JPM, MS, etc.), OTC derivatives were collateralized in 2008.

OTC you are contracting directly with a counterparty, whereas on an exchange your principal is the exchange themselves, and they are effectively taking on the counterparty risk.\n\nI have long argued that most (if not all) of the sites where you can trade bitcoin are not exchanges at all, for exactly that reason. They are simply matching buyers and sellers in OTC trades. The risk of your counterparty walking is entirely yours.\n\nThat's how it is in traditional futures trading, it seems it would be helpful if Bitcoin traders understood this.\n\n": 1, '- Why should anyone trust your oracle?\n- What is the planned system architecture for the "robust ecosystem of oracles" ?\n- The forward contract is interesting, not novel, but good to see someone finally implementing ideas that have been around for so long, what other products are in the line-up to "prove out use cases"?\n- What other companies/entities are you going to be measuring up against to know that you are "setting industry standards"?\n\nThanks, Head of Product.': 2, "Totally get how that is - I'm working on launching a site and it never ends.

The derivatives counterparties that want to collateralize don't have any problems doing so (therefore your service doesn't help them) and the ones that don't want to, well, they don't want to (so your service is irrelevant to them).\n\nActually the collateralization of derivatives between banks works so well that the Lehman bankruptcy was pretty much a non-event in that space.

One chain is the v4 chain, for the BIP065 tests. That chain is/was the longest in terms of the number of blocks, but most of the blocks were mined at very low difficulty and so it is not the chain with the most valid work.\n\nWe haven\'t found any block explorers yet that are consistently following the BIP101 tests.\n\nAs for the block time, arrival time difference: that\'s mostly my doing. One of the "features" of testnet is that after 20 minutes, the block difficulty gets set to 1. This timer is based on the timestamp of the block, not the clock of the recipient of the block, which means anyone can mine a block in a second by setting their clock 20 minutes ahead. The limit of this behavior is 2 hours, because a node will reject a block if its timestamp is 2 hours ahead of the receiver\'s clock. To try to minimize this issue, I set my mining server\'s system clock to 1h55m ahead of real time. This mostly worked for us, and is effective at preventing others from mining free blocks on top of mine, but if a peer has a system clock that is more than 5 minutes behind, they will reject the block. That has happened on several occasions, and has made the tests messy.\n\nFYI, I will not always be posting or reading /r/bitcoin about this because of the censorship on this forum targeted at one of the pieces of software that was used during this testing.
