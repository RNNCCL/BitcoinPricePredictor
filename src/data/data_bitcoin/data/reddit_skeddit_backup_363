Which also means we can have 1 firmware for setup and 1 firmware for operation, getting rid of the code size limitation that was one thing preventing us from implementing BIP 39 on the device itself. The other one was SHA 512 speed, which has been improved a lot as well, now we can stretch the mnemonic in 3 minutes 30 seconds, which is acceptable for setup.\n\nSo with the next version, the device will mix user and device entropy to generate a "swapped" 24 words BIP 39 mnemonic.

That\'s really as hard as it gets.\n\nHow is this different from a wallet? Well, not all wallets contain a full copy of the blockchain. Lightweight clients just connect to a database somewhere in the cloud instead of storing it locally.\n\nYou don\'t need a terribly powerful system to run a node. There is some talk about utilizing Raspberry Pis as full nodes. Probably the biggest issue is hard drive space. The blockchain file is currently 38GB and growing at a very fast pace. Given the ever increasing number of transactions year over year, we could be talking about hundreds of GBs in a short period of time. Also, if a device is terribly slow, it might have high latency -and if too many slow devices crowd the network, it might slow the whole thing down. But I don\'t really know the specifics.\n\nAt the point that the blockchain starts consuming all of our hard drive space, no doubt we will have a new update to Bitcoin Core that allows different bitcoin nodes to hold different portions of the blockchain. "Merkel Trees" or "Pruning" are the words that get thrown around in this particular discussion.\n\nSo why is it important to run a full node if you can? Because bitcoin maintains its robustness by having a favourable ratio of honest bitcoin nodes to hostile bitcoin nodes. If the honest get lazy and some really organized attacker starts running a lot of nodes, he/she/they could try to distribute false blockchains, or attack our anonymity by recording the origin IP addresses of every bitcoin transaction.

The truth is he studies and writes about money for a living and probably knows more about it than almost anyone else on the planet. Specifically, he thinks about money in an abstract way as shown by [his Baby Sitter Club](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=2&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CCUQFjABahUKEwi8nvfX3eLGAhVL1h4KHXkxA2k&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.slate.com%2Farticles%2Fbusiness%2Fthe_dismal_science%2F1998%2F08%2Fbabysitting_the_economy.html&ei=7UCpVfzzNcuse_nijMgG&usg=AFQjCNGlrYl8xD5rw-nAT7lkSYIs2x1GnQ&bvm=bv.97949915,d.dmo) thought experiment. His focus on Japanese deflation in the 90s and international trade before that had him doing a lot of thinking and writing about how different currencies work against each other. While he may not get the technology behind Bitcoin (which is important for him to get), he understands money.\n\nIt\'s also important to understand the context he answers these questions in: basically "will Bitcoin replace the USD"? \n\nAnd it\'s important to understand context of what Krugman has been writing about in economics lately. In the midst of people who are against "printing money" and the acts of the Federal Reserve, he\'s basically defending the fact that recent Fed acts have had a stabilizing effect on the economy, prevented a deflationary spiral, and haven\'t raised inflation like people worried. If USD were more like Bitcoin (with no levers to raise the money supply), the 2008 recession would probably have been a lot worse. \n\nHe\'s also recently writing about Greece a case where their inability to control their money (cause they use Euros instead of their own currency) has caused major issues over there. While Bitcoin might be a good investment vs the drachma if it came back, Bitcoin couldn\'t have done anything to prevent what happened to the Greek economy.\n\nSo Krugman sees a currency with no monetary controls and no inflation and (rightly in my opinion) argues that it\'s not better than government-backed money. So systematically it\'s not better to him. And he thinks credit cards are good enough, so from a consumer standpoint it\'s not better.\n\nI agree. However, it doesn\'t mean that Bitcoin is useless. There is a need and use for non-government backed money like this, and it can live in harmony with USDs, Euros, and other money. I wish Krugman did more thinking about how Bitcoin could exist alongside other currencies, similar to gold reserve or other transactional assets.\n\nKrugman\'s concerns are still important for people to address:\n\n1. How is it easier to use than credit cards?\n\n2. What "backs" it if not the faith of a sovereign nation or a useful resource like gold?\n\nI would argue these answers:\n\n1. Sometimes you want to use digital "cash" vs digital "credit". Also lower fees are important on everyday credit card transactions (0% vs 3%) but are important in remittances (5-10% vs 30%).\n\n2. The public ledger is a useful system for verifying ownership of other things outside of Bitcoin and we\'ll ultimate find the systems built on top the blockchain useful enough to warrant keeping the system running which will provide a base demand for Bitcoins.\n\nTL;DR: I think Krugman is a smart person, and we should spend more time trying to win him over to our side instead of just vilifying or ignoring him.': 3, 'what the bitcoin community and even satoshi failed to specify is what bitcoin actually is. the differentiation between *money* and *currency* is quite elemental.\nsatoshi used the term *currency* in his whitepaper - this is from an economics perspective extremely problematic.\n\nkrugmans argument (and I think most economist share this argument) is that a *currency* is backed by governments force to ask for taxes in *that specific form currency* - for more information see modern monetary theory: http://neweconomicperspectives.org/modern-monetary-theory-primer.html\n\nbitcoin would do better to call itself at best *cash* or maybe even better *money* - this would help to get some serious discussion with economist.\n\nkrugman at the same time would do better to inform deeper about bitcoin because some of his assumptions are at best based on misconceptions about bitcoin or at worst wrong. he definetely lacks vision and has a status quo bias. \n\nat the same time I feel terribly ashamed for the people calling him a clown.

If the government decides to debase the currency, *the value of your dollars decreases*.

In fact, I would argue that, since no one person or organization can hyperinflate bitcoin, that bitcoin is *more* secure than the dollar. \n\nThe only thing securing the dollar\'s value right now is its network effect. When bitcoin\'s user network rivals that of the dollar (if that ever happens), people won\'t be claiming that it\'s laws that give a currency its value, which is ridiculous on its face. Dollars had value as gold certificates long before they were accepted in payment for taxes; otherwise they would not have been acceptable in payment of taxes. \n\nThe fact that dollars still have value despite not being backed by anything is simply a relic from the days when it *was* backed by gold. The only thing keeping the dollar alive today is the gigantic global network of users and the lack of any *other* asset which is spendable in so many places. That is, a currency is a network of individuals who have agreed to pay each other\'s debts. Since the dollar is the largest such network, it makes sense to join and participate in the network, because this maximizes your options for reimbursement when you provide value to someone else in the network. This "chicken and egg" effect is what keeps the dollar strong. It\'s just like any other network, like Facebook or owning a telephone. And like Facebook, bitcoin can steal the dollar\'s (MySpace\'s) network once people realize that it\'s fundamentally superior. \n\nMy point with all this is that, if bitcoin\'s network and technology mature to the point where millions of people all over the world are accepting it, the fact that dollars are accepted in payment of taxes in America will be proven irrelevant.

Bill Gates isn\'t dumb. He doesn\'t have a limited view of what computers can be used for. Krugman isn\'t dumb, and doesn\'t think that the internet "isn\'t viable". He makes his living mostly on the internet these days, and while he\'s as fuddy-duddy as anyone his age, he\'s generally more forward thinking than his peers (he\'s a fan of Asimov\'s Foundation series and Psychohistory).\n\nHis last prediction from that article is telling about what he was up against in terms of the mentality of people toward the internet then (emphasis mine):\n\n> Sometime in the next 20 years, maybe sooner, there will be another \'70s-style raw-material crunch: a disruption of oil supplies, a sharp run-up in agricultural prices, or both. And suddenly people will remember that *we are still living in the material world and that natural resources matter*.\n\nBy 2005, the Internet hadn\'t really changed things as much as it has in the 10 years since. And in that time I think Krugman has realized how the internet is important and also where it\'s not important.\n\nEdit: [Krugman\'s response to the 1998 comments coming up recently](http://www.businessinsider.com/paul-krugman-responds-to-internet-quote-2013-12).\n\n> First, look at the whole piece. It was a thing for the Times magazine\'s 100th anniversary, written as if by someone looking back from 2098, so the point was to be fun and provocative, not to engage in careful forecasting; I mean, there are lines in there about St. Petersburg having more skyscrapers than New York, which was not a prediction, just a thought-provoker.\n\n> But the main point is that I don\'t claim any special expertise in technology -- I almost never make technological forecasts, and the only reason there was stuff like that in the 98 piece was because the assignment required that I do that sort of thing. The issues about Bitcoin, however, are not technological! Everyone agrees that it\'s technically very sweet. But does it work as money? That\'s a very different kind of question.\n\nWith regards to Bitcoin, I think he\'s just not thinking about Bitcoin as a technology at all. The typical questions he deals with day to day are like:\n\n* Should the US go back to the gold standard?\n* Should Greek leave the Euro for their own currency?\n* Should country X stop tying their currency to the USD or the Euro.\n* Should the US raise or lower interest rates.\n\nSo when Bitcoin comes up, it\'s natural for him to think "Should Bitcoin replace other currencies" instead of "how will the technology behind Bitcoin disrupt money". I think he doesn\'t even address Bitcoin on the level it needs to be and probably doesn\'t think he\'s equipped to judge the technology. \n\nDespite his fondness for Asimov (or maybe because of), he probably like most people suffers from linear thinking vs exponential thinking and doesn\'t really account for the fact that technological advances of all kinds are likely to happen more rapidly going forward. \n\nBut even then things will probably happen slower than us optimists think. Bitcoin probably isn\'t going to replace USD over the next couple years, or couple decades. And while it\'s likely to grow into something really big, and Krugman jokes about the price being a bubble, I think that\'s more to due with his inability to gauge investments (he doesn\'t tackle stock or company valuations either -- he\'s a macro guy).

And because we publish a real-time accounting of obligations and assets in our reserve, anyone at anytime can confirm that Bitreserve is solvent**. We are finally giving people a safe and transparent alternative to where and how they hold their money and we are competing against the legacy financial system on the stewardship of this money.\n\n> We are also fully committed to respecting the privacy of our members and **do not sell any of our member\'s data, nor do we have any intention of doing so in the future**."\n\nhttps://support.bitreserve.org/hc/en-us/articles/205290895-How-does-Bitreserve-make-money-': 1, "You understand it perfectly. We offer ZERO cost forex. No tricks. No small print (although we do have rate limits which might impact high volume traders). There is ZERO spread. There are NO FEES. It is all part of our mission around resetting the world's expectations around how financial services should be run and how much they should cost the everyday consumer. It is amazing though - people are so accustomed to the status quo, that believing much less accepting that we can manage to do this for our customers is an anathema to them. \n\nWe all understand why foreign exchange costs money, why spreads exist, and what counter-party risk is all about. But to the everyday person on this planet, foreign exchange costs and fees have a disproportionately negative effect on us. When I send money overseas, forex fees suck a tremendous amount of value from what is ultimately received. That sucks if you are a poor family in Guatemala, and all you were doing is sending $100. And don't get me started on Western Union fees, oh boy! The point though is this - we believe the simple service of taking dollars from someone, and delivering pounds to someone else should not be a profit center for the company. We can and therefore should give that service away for free. So we do. \n\nWith that in mind, if you are a currency speculator, a professional grade exchange might still be a better option for you, since you can leverage your investments, trade on margin, and be un-impeding by rate limits, etc. If you are a hobbyist speculator, Bitreserve might be perfect for you. And if you are simply trying to send $100, or hell, a $1,000,000 to someone overseas and be assured that 100% of what you sent, arrives at the other end, well then, Bitreserve was designed specifically for you. \n\nIf you are a business, or an institutional trader that wants to take advantage of our FREE PLATFORM, but at higher limits, etc. then please contact us.
