Typically, this is just some data which makes the "challenge" script evaluate to true.\n\n- An output can only be spent by an input which correctly solves its "challenge".\n\n- There are multiple [types of challenges](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Transaction#Types_of_Transaction). The most common one is called "pay-to-pubkeyhash" and is what Bitcoin clients put in outputs when sending to Bitcoin addresses which start with "1".\n\n- A "pay-to-pubkeyhash" challenge is solved by a "solution" script which supplies the correct public key and signature.\n\n- Note: challenge/solution are not standard terminology. They are called scriptPubKey/scriptSig in the real world.\n\nThe insight behind "segregated witness" is that "solution" scripts in inputs end up taking a lot of space in blocks but could be transmitted separately, permitting more transactions to fit in 1MB blocks. That sounds like a tautology (hell, why not take out more stuff as well) but what makes "segregated witness" interesting is that this would be possible to achieve without a hard fork (that is, older bitcoin clients would keep working fine even if they are running an older version of Bitcoin). \n\n"Segregated witness" outputs would use a new type of "challenge" script which only consists of data (a version number and a serialised "challenge" script). Those "challenge" scripts would be considered solvable by anyone according to old Bitcoin clients but new rules would be introduced to define what "solves" them. Without getting into details, those new rules would involve obtaining the "solution" script (aka "witness data") separately and making sure it solves the serialised "challenge" script. \n\nAs soon as a majority of miners have upgraded to this newer bitcoin version, only transactions which obey the new rules will make it into the blockchain and people can start using this new type of output without risking them being spendable by everyone.\n\nAs an added bonus, transactions spending those new types of outputs won\'t have any signature in them solving the infamous transaction malleability issues.': 2, "There's been a thread a day about this.

The signature part is the authorization to move the funds. Currently they are bundled together, however this causes some problems, like people messing with other people\'s transactions or their transaction id by republishing them in a different format. \n\nSegregated witness fixes those problems through a reorganization of the transaction data that standardizes away the different formats. \n\nAdditionally, there are ways to transmit signature validity that don\'t take up much space at all, so this means that if every transaction uses sigwit maybe 2-4x transactions could fit in the same bandwidth we have today, and I think validation would go faster too.

Nobody wants to get goxxed and users are always sceptical.\n\nIn my opinion you should never store your funds at some other place than your own wallet for an extended period of time. That\'s why I like OneHash so much because you only deposit money per single bet. So you don\'t have to create an account and deposit god knows how much in order to start playing. You want to bet on an event, you send them your money, event is over and they send you back your winnings, simple as that. You might want to try it out as it\'s not that big of a deal, they have a policy that the minimum bet can be 0.001 BTC and that\'s it. One of the things that generally repels me is that you have to create an account in order to try a service out. Or for example if you want to buy bitcoins at coinbase you need to supply them with your id and stuff. I don\'t like that, so OneHash is nice to be a bit different and allows people to just pop in without the need to create an account, deposit a lot of money etc.\n\nI think we\'re still in the "early adopters" stage and we probably still will be in that stage for 2-3 more years, but with time the companies behind those services will become more reliable and stuff.

It does add a lot of uncertainty though, which is why I thought user vs user bets would be better arranged in a maker/taker sort of way (offer up odds and others can choose to take the other side).

I deal with this every day since I've moved from the US to the UK due to my wife's military orders. They should be refunding the 3.1 BTC.  \n  \nThe exchange rates for currencies are changing every day. If I purchase something online that shows a price in GBP, but it's pulling from my US bank account/credit card, it converts the $ into GBP at the current exchange rate. If I later wanted a refund, they would refund the GBP into $ at the current exchange rate. So, say something cost 30 GBP on day 1, that could equate to $45. If on day 3 I needed a refund, they would refund 30 GBP, but that may only be $44 on that day due to the exchange rate.  \n  \nSince those currencies fluctuate small amounts over relatively short periods of time, there's not too much of a difference. With BTC still being in flux, it can make a difference, and in this case an unfortunate one for Newegg.

The *work* required to get the initial bitcoins was so low that early adopters amassed hordes. Artificial scarcity is just a method to protect the early adopter holdings, it has no basis in any coherent monetary science. *Money* scarcity is related not to an artificially imposed limit but to productive assets backing new issuance.

I agree that in a fiat system, money is just a transfer medium, labor and assets are the value.  So your goal is either maximize labor productivity or acquire assets which generate income. Because sitting on money does nothing for you. In a bitcoin system, bitcoin is the value asset.  So if I have bitcoin why spend it. What i need to do is get more to further restrict supply or incentivize others to bid up the price. But there is no mechanism in a fixed currency economy to really increase the value of your fixed supply by consuming because of transaction costs and the feedback loop of the value of the currency increasing at the same rate the economy expands.\n\nEveryone knows this, if Bitcoin economy grows to 20 billion, from now, then my holdings will be worth 5 times more, so I need to get more bitcoins.  In a fiat system it doesnt work like that. Supply grows to match demand, so in constant terms you Dollars will either by the same product or decline in value, so you need to get a hold of tools that will allow you to keep pace with the expanding economy.\n\nThe only economy that is exists in bitcoinland is bitcoins, producing bitcoins or selling bitcoins. Nothing else exists.  And everyone know that producing bitcoins is a money loser unless you have a scheme to offload the cost of production to someone else and you simply reap the reward.\n\nBitcoin supply is fixed so any increase in  real demand has to be met by an increase in real price.  So my incentive is to sit on my coins and do nothing and wait for the price to go up. Which is what the majority of Bicoiners do. Its also why mining is a losing game, miners are not producing any real ROI, via bitcoin reward, they are running a option system by borrowing at low rates, exploiting borrowing or crowd sourcing from the public to acquire capital at near zero cost to sell the public bitcoins.  The only reason mining is profitable is by offloading all the costs to the public in 3 ways.\n1. Stealing from the public outright through fraud, by having the public finance the capital investment. KNC, Butterfly, etc.\n2. Borrowing from VCs or Zero rate loans\n3. Exploiting Power Grids. Mining has moved to china because there is no regulations and stealing electricity is  easy.\n4. Or running a loss, because you will make money in the future from appreciation, but in that case you should;ve just acquired bitcoin.\n\n\nI still believe bitcoin has a function as an independent store of value. But just like gold economies, these values are transient because its only needed in times of disruption to the productive economy. \nPeople think gold was pushed out by governments, but gold was pushed out because its a terrible technology in a modern financial system.\n\nWhen the productive "real" economy is functioning you want to have assets and labor.\n\nI get you man, still holding my bitcoins though.\n': 2, "> Transferring wealth from 1 group to another.\n\nHas happened regularly in human history.

We know that the first ever bitcoin transaction was made between Satoshi and Finney.

In this way bitgold evolved in to bitcoin. Technically one could argue that therefore Satoshi was not one person, but a combination of both Szabo and Finney and maybe others.
