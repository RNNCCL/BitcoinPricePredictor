I, certainly, am much happier that my home mortgage is in fiat, instead of BTC.\n\n\nBut if large-scale loans, like mortgages, were denominated in bitcoin, what would that look like?\n\n\nTo remain competitive in this context, banks lending in BTC could lower their interest rates, effectively compensating for the deflation. And just as banks estimate the ROI of their loans relative to inflation, they could equally do so, relative to deflation. If deflation were to be particularly extreme, one might imagine a competitive bank offering a negative interest rate.  (Not unlike Switzerland or the ECB have done.)  But this is where this idea seems to break down. Would a consumer-facing bank ever have the incentive to offer a negative interest rate loan, when they could just keep the BTC instead for a higher growth rate? More broadly, can effective lending happen in a highly deflationary currency?\n\n\nFor much of AD history, gold has been a popular currency.

By setting the limit to 1MB, practically anyone with any device was able to fully participate while protecting the growing network from potential DoS or otherwise harmful attacks.\nNow, we're about to bump into this limit for what appear to be legitimate reasons; the network has grown such that 1MB blocks are justified.\n\nBecause this limit was imposed so (relatively) long ago, while the network has grown so much in the past few years, the rule has become a rather pesky limit which is now hard to get rid of in a way everyone agrees is the best or correct way to do.\n\nBecause nobody, nor a strong majority, for now, agrees what to do; nothing happens. This is both one of bitcoin's strengths, aswell as (in this case) its weakness.\nThe problem we're bumping into is that the network, by its own rules, will only permit about 3-4 transactions per second. Ideally, judging by what most agree with, we should be able to do much more, in order to accomodate much more activity and provide more value and utility to the network.\n\nThe solution is to change the rules we all agree exist and are valid. But this presents us with another problem, which we refer to as a 'hard fork'; we'll be changing bitcoin in a way it isn't compatible with the way it used to work, which means we'll make previous versions of the protocol incompatible with the new / proposed versions. Anyone running an older version of the bitcoin protocol / software will (assuming a hard fork) be discarded from the network (as far as their participation goes), which is a big problem considering bitcoin is supposed to be a network which doesn't require you to conform to anyone's thoughts or ideas or rules.\n\nIf we can agree on a way to change the rules such that everyone is happy (which many people are working on) or can at least accept the way we change things; nothing bad will happen. But so long as we are not in agreement in the way we will change things (if at all) we will only fragment the network and the community if undesirable changes are continued to be pushed.\n\nEventually though, this problem will be solved and put behind us, one way or another.\n\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/376s09/mentor_monday_may_25_2015_ask_all_your_bitcoin/crksw22\n\n----\n\nSome (concrete) options that are on the table now are the following:\n\n----\n\nBIP 100 - The current limit imposed on the network enforced by the entirety (nodes, miners) shall be removed, and replaced by a miner-enforced soft-fork mechanism which makes miners the deciders (through voting) on when and by how much to increase the block size limit. A (historic) hard limit of 32 MB remains and must be removed through (another) hard fork later down the line. This proposal will likely provide organic growth of the block size limit with the network's adoption and miner's capability to deploy hardware, but nodes must yield the consensus-enforced control they have on the network and in (arguably extreme) scenario's be unable to cheaply validate the network and blockchain.\n\nhttp://gtf.org/garzik/bitcoin/BIP100-blocksizechangeproposal.pdf\n\n----\n\nGavin's doubling schedule\n\nThe block size limit is to be increased to 8MB and will double every 2 years after that. Nodes remain in control of enforcing this consensus rule, but whether or not this rule is too optimistic or pessimistic (whether the limit increases keep up with network and hardware capability growth fast enough, or not fast enough) is completely unclear (and unpredictable). The limit, in this proposal, does not organically grow with the network, it grows at a predetermined rate (which may be wrong). This patch has been deployed in the (rather controversial) Bitcoin-XT fork which is maintained by Mike Hearn rather than the Bitcoin core developers which have created and worked on all previous versions of Bitcoin Core and the bitcoin protocol. This hard fork would be done at a (rather low) 75% miner agreement threshold, if a fork happens at this threshold and nodes, merchants, businesses have not adapted to this version we'll be heading into a very turbulent time indeed.\n\nhttps://github.com/gavinandresen/bitcoinxt/commit/821e223ccc4c8ab967399371761718f1015c766b\n\n----\n\nDo nothing.\n\nThe limit shall remain at 1MB, blocks will likely fill up, causing transaction fees to rise and a fee market to come into existence.

They simply can't all be done on one blockchain - **they have mutually inconsistent requirements**.\n\nWhat the main chain can (and must) do is provide the anchor for all this. The gold standard which backs all the others. Crucially, the others can have all sorts of functions and trade off security, speed, decentralisation, volume as required. But their security all ultimately depends on (and is limited by) the security and decentralization of the parent chain.\n\nFrom that perspective it seems obvious to me that we should prioritise the security and decentralization of the parent chain. That doesn't rule out 20Mb blocks (there must be some block size that is too small for the parent).

Or do you mean the removal of currency out of the system, while overall value remains the same, thereby increasing purchasing power over time and encouraging saving?\n\nThey both result in the same, but are fundamentally different in concept.\n\nTo clarify: the former can happen in bitcoin through organic growth and increasing + productive economic activity in the ecosystem, the latter *only* happens when currency (both fake, like in fractional reserve banking and real, like people losing coins or intentionally destroying them) is removed (or in the case of fractional reserve banking; repayed) from the system.\n\nIf deflation happens because of increased productivity (the former) then that doesn't necessarily mean loss of profit for those participating in the economy: the economy is essentially running more efficiently than it was previously; no value is lost, only gained. Businesses can now sell more (increased productivity), for less (resulting deflation), but with equal (or likely higher, because deflation is lagging) profit. The ability to pay off debt or the ability to lend is not affected for this reason.\n\nIn the case of the latter, however, the economy *loses* value, it contracts, because previously existing currency is being removed from the economy. Profits go down and it's getting harder to pay off debt. This is what happens with the euro, usd and most fiat currencies which bear with fractional reserve banking when we're talking about deflation (when debt is repayed: currency disappears), it also happened in bitcoin when gox went sideways; they were essentially running a fractional reserve bank and all creditors immediately had their currency disappear.\n\nTL;DR\n\nIf we're in a deflationary situation due to economic contraction: lending and the ability to pay off debt is badly affected.\n\nIf we're in a deflationary situation because of economic growth and increased productivity: lending and the ability to pay off debt is not affected.": 1, "That doesn't address the fundamental question though.\n\nIf deflation were steady at say 10%, why would any bank want to issue a consumer loan at less than 10%?\n\nThrough fractional reserve lending, sure;  a 1% rate could still be very profitable.

In January, a problem in the system linking accounts at Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, the country\xe2\x80\x99s largest lender, with securities brokerages, disrupted Rmb4.9bn in fund transfers, affecting nearly 55,000 customers at 90 brokerages.\nBank-IT-spend-chart\nAs regulators make ever growing demands on banks to provide them with vast amounts of data for everything from stress tests to anti-money laundering checks, banks are racing to keep their systems up to speed.\nDeutsche Bank insiders blamed its failure in this year\xe2\x80\x99s US stress test on years of under-investment in IT that made it unable to meet US regulators\xe2\x80\x99 demands.\nConcern is growing about cyber security after a string of high profile hacking attacks, such as last year\xe2\x80\x99s theft of data on 76m customers from computer systems at JPMorgan Chase.\nExecutives say this focus on cyber security is a catalyst for change, pushing banks to simplify and upgrade their IT systems. \xe2\x80\x9cMaking something secure requires it to be consistent and clean and up to date and well managed,\xe2\x80\x9d says the US tech executive.\nJames O\xe2\x80\x99Neill, senior analyst at Celent, predicts that within a decade most big banks will have switched from using costly mainframe computers for overnight processing of customer data to using much more flexible cloud-based services.\nIf nothing else, the shortage of developers trained in the Cobol programming language that drives most bank mainframes will force them to make the switch. Australia\xe2\x80\x99s CBA has moved to a cloud-based system, while Deutsche recently outsourced many of its applications to a cloud provider.\nBank-IT-spend-chart\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe story about legacy systems impeding innovation is a bit oversold,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr O\xe2\x80\x99Neill. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not saying they will go on for ever, but they have done a pretty decent job of supplying new products and services.\xe2\x80\x9d\nLike many sectors, however, banks are realising the need to harness the power of \xe2\x80\x9cbig data\xe2\x80\x9d to offer better digital services to their customers.\nMr Michael at KPMG says his banking clients know the stakes are high. \xe2\x80\x9cThey have seen what technology has done to music and home shopping and so far they have been relatively slow to adapt \xe2\x80\x94 but the longer they wait the harder it will get.\xe2\x80\x9d\nAdditional reporting by Ben McLannahan, Emma Dunkley, Jennifer Hughes and Gabriel Wildau\nBBVA tackles the US via digital banking\n \nFrancisco Gonz\xc3\xa1lez, the former software engineer who is now chief executive of Spain\xe2\x80\x99s BBVA, is scathing about the messy compromises that many banks make to patch their IT systems together.\n\xe2\x80\x9cMost of the banks have started at the rooftop. How did they manage to work without the foundations and the floors? Just middleware \xe2\x80\x94 more spaghetti on the spaghetti.\xe2\x80\x9d he says in an interview with the Financial Times.\n\nAfter rounds of acquisitions, many large retail and commercial banks are tangled up in legacy systems which run the risk of breaking or presenting opportunities for intruders to gain access.\nAt the same time, banks are building on more features because they need to present an attractive digital product to consumers. At the same time, financial technology start-ups are nibbling away at the business, presenting what Mr Gonz\xc3\xa1lez asserts is an existential challenge for lenders.\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy view is that many of them won\xe2\x80\x99t make it,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cThey don\xe2\x80\x99t know that. That is my opinion. We are ahead of the pack and we aspire to be the disrupter, coming from the conventional world, the banking sector.\xe2\x80\x9d\nBBVA has spent more than \xe2\x82\xac850m annually on technology for the past few years, including the painful and expensive decision to replace legacy systems \xe2\x80\x94 Mr Gonzalez\xe2\x80\x99s loathed spaghetti \xe2\x80\x94 with a modern data centre.\nThe chief executive now feels ready to tackle the US, where he has the country\xe2\x80\x99s 33rd largest bank by assets, branded BBVA Compass, which last year acquired Simple, a digital bank. The bank\xe2\x80\x99s active Silicon Valley ventures arm has also invested in Coinbase, a bitcoin platform.\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor us the US is the most promising market,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the largest market in the world, one of the most digital societies in the world, and the retail banking system is quite a bit elementary.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe gap has to be filled by someone and we want to be one of the guys. BBVA Compass is the platform. We need to be a digital challenger in the States,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have installed all the platforms, and we can connect start-ups to it. BBVA Compass will roll out a complete universal bank in the digital world.\xe2\x80\x9d\n': 8, 'CHUP': 1, "it's like online banking. it's cheaper and more accessible than traditional. same goes for blockchain against online banking. the downside is that it comes with a learning curve for an average customer. banks are really starting to see bitcoin as a way to cut down expenses.
