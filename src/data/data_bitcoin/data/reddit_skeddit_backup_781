For middle amounts you should use desktop client (Bitcoin core is one option, Electrum is another). For huge amounts Bitcoin Trezor is certainly good idea (it protects coins even when computer is completely compromised).\n\nThe most important thing you should understand is that using Bitcoin is not about accounts. When you install desktop client, you immediately have empty wallet set up.\n\nIn case of Bitcoin core, you can click "Receive Bitcoin", fill in description and it will create you unique address. You can have as many addresses as you want. Using different addresses can help you protect your privacy.\n\nThere are services which store Bitcoins for you but beware - they are in control of your Bitcoins! You need to trust them or don\'t store huge amount of Bitcoins. One of them is changetip which makes it very easy for you to send coins to other users. I have only small amount of Bitcoins stored in my changetip account for security reasons.\n\nGood luck and feel free to ask if you have other questions!': 1, 'changetip here': 1, "you can make an alias on blockchain.info by going to account settings. its under the personal tab.\n\nchangetip will accept your tips for you automatically if you have an account.

I have maybe $5 on changetip so im able to tip people whenever I want.\n\nThe rest of my bitcoin that I have are held on blockchain for spending money, using say the gyft app. The bitcoin I am holding onto (for the future) is stored on bitgo.\n\nIt's a good idea not to have all your eggs in one basket.
