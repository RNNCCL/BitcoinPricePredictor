Until yesterday, even Brian Armstrong, CEO of one of the biggest bitcoin exchanges, *legitimately believed* that miners had full control of bitcoin. From there, he came to the conclusion that the miners were in some way giving up this control to the development team.\n\nAlthough his wish to have the miners reclaim their power seemed noble, it turns out that he was really advocating for a hostile attack by the miners without even realizing it.\n\nHopefully, the debate can now move forward in a way that everyone can agree with.": 1, 'Why are we even having this argument?  It\'s all semantics.  Users and miners have a mutualistic relationship.  Neither is in "control" they are co-dependent.

It's one line of code.  Hundreds of altcoins have implemented a higher effective block size with faster blocks, none of them have been attacked in the way the devs are worried about.

Some (profitable mining) coins have a 2 second block time, orphan rates are 20% and they haven't been bandwidth attacked.\n\nI don't think the devs are very interested in data.  If they were, they'd see that mining decentralization has *increased* over the past couple years despite block size doubling approximately every year.  Not decreased.  And orphan rate has stayed about the same since 2009.  The real world data is conclusive, bigger blocks are not a problem.  \n\nI guess segwit is cool.  But it only increases tps by 1.6-1.8X.  That's less than the most conservative BIP, Garzik's 2MB proposal.  I still support it because I support anything that increases throughput, but segwit is the lamest increase ever.  And by the way, I don't think it should even be called a soft-fork, that seems like a technicality definition.

Even over an unreasonable length of time (say, months), this quantity can\'t compete with the 15 million+ coins currently in circulation.\n\nIn fact, in my view, miners don\'t really own Bitcoin at all. They merely own the *option* to buy ~25.01 Bitcoins at price X (where price X becomes "the" expected price of Bitcoin, every two weeks). Miners have to pay their power bill, of course. Even if the power company accepted Bitcoin, it doesn\'t make the bill go away.': 4, '> It\'s one line of code.\n\nThat\'s not what the technical debate is about.

Come to think of it, it\'d probably be helpful if they did try that. That way, we\'ll have real data to talk about for that attack.\n\n> I don\'t think the devs are very interested in data.\n\n>> Hence the personal attacks against the developers.\n\n.\n\n> mining decentralization has increased over the past couple years despite block size doubling approximately every year.

If full nodes are no longer able to validate transactions and must upgrade to do so then it should be considered a hard fork.\n\nIf that\'s the case, would that technically mean that you got the hard-fork blocksize increase like you were asking for?

The relay network has helped a lot.\n\nIt might be semantic, but I don\'t think it\'s pointless because I think it\'s deceptive calling it a soft-fork to gain acceptance.  Technically we could do the same thing with transaction data itself, throw it all in an extension block linked to a merkle root in the coinbase.  Old nodes would still validate the coinbase-only bitcoin blocks but would be unaware of the real transaction data and that would be technically a "soft-fork" but old nodes would be rendered useless.

Like you said, the original question and answer is part of "a pointless and semantic debate". I agree, so let\'s not waste time with it. But for that to happen, we need people to stop bringing it up. Hence this post.': 3, "> Anecdotal, but from what I've seen is all but the devs agree that a hard fork max block size increase must happen.\n\nIndeed, so if the devs end up agreeing with that, I don't think that there will be any pushback from the other stakeholders. The problem is that they don't agree with that. Because this is a highly technical issue, I think that many of the people that make up the other stakeholders would be right to be wary about proceeding without the dev team's support. What the people who are arguing that we should proceed anyway seem to be saying is that deferring to the development team for a highly technical issue is wrong. Hence the personal attacks against the developers.\n\nInterestingly enough, the tactics that *do* work are exactly what you think they would be: presenting data to the developers to convince them that they may be wrong. That's exactly what the Scaling Bitcoin conferences were all about. And out of that conference, we got a softfork method of implementing Segregated Witness, which also happened to give us the opportunity to effectively raise the blocksize via a softfork while we are at it. Unlike extension blocks, it's not even that big of a deal to do it this way, since SegWit is such a great addition to bitcoin on its own that it would make sense to add it even without the blocksize debate.

This is true notwithstanding OP\xe2\x80\x99s unsupported and bold assertion that **"It can be done."**\n\n>History suggests settlement systems must start out as widely accepted payment systems. Before gold was used for settlement, it was a widely accepted form of payment. US dollars had to be backed by gold to gain adoption as a payment system. Digital US dollars had to be fungible with physical currency. Today, despite the fact that it\xe2\x80\x99s no longer backed by gold, the US dollar is used for settlement because it\xe2\x80\x99s widely accepted for payments.\n\nThis is an inappropriate comparison.  The US dollar is not a settlement system; It\xe2\x80\x99s a currency that settlement systems settle in.  Gold is not a settlement system.  It\xe2\x80\x99s a currency/money.  The settlement systems are either hand to hand exchange (which can\xe2\x80\x99t be done with Bitcoin because it is not physical), or all of the huge financial industry mechanisms built to transfer these assets.  Bitcoin, however, is both a currency and a built in payment network that handles payments and settles them with blockchain \xe2\x80\x9cconfirmation.\xe2\x80\x9d  The best ideas that presently exist are to still use the Bitcoin payment network and settlement system (confirmation) while adding another payment network that is not limited by the constraints of the legacy.  The latter (lightning network, if you will) will be a payment network, but it will not require confirmation for every payment.  However, users will have the option for confirmation if they so choose.\n\nSo this conclusion really is without understanding (or is duplicitous):\n\n>It\xe2\x80\x99s possible that Bitcoin might find adoption as a settlement system without first gaining widespread adoption as a payment system, but I think it\xe2\x80\x99s unlikely.\n\nThe aim should not be to promote the adoption of Bitcoin as a \xe2\x80\x9csettlement system\xe2\x80\x9d or a \xe2\x80\x9cpayment system.\xe2\x80\x9d  **The aim is to promote Bitcoin as a currency/money** (store of value, medium of exchange, and ultimately a unit of account).  The blockchain with its concomitant payment system (i.e. settlement system) is the first step in that aim, as it provides an immutable record.  This allows for the use of the currency as a store of value and a limited payment system.  The next step to make Bitcoin (the currency) adoptable is to increase the number of payments the system is capable of handling.  This could be done by clumsily increasing the cap, but this comes with costs and still leaves the system too limited for mass adoption.  Or, a new payment network can be built that relies upon the legacy system for it\xe2\x80\x99s settlement properties, but is not constrained by the need to confirm every transaction.  The latter could allow payments that exceed those of Visa, while the former (simply raising the cap limit\xe2\x80\x94even at the most aggressive estimates of what the network could sustain today) will still only allow for 100s\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s not scalable.  AND it leads to centralization.\n\n>Those that argue that Bitcoin should only be used for settlement are really saying that they don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99s possible for a decentralized cryptocurrency to process a high volume of transactions.\n\nNobody is suggesting that Bitcoin (the currency) should only be used for settlement (as gold was once used only for settlement of USD transactions); what is suggested is that blockchain confirmation should be used for settlement.  Accordingly, those with the idea of building the second, more capable, payment network are, in fact, saying that **they have found a way to have a decentralized cryptocurrency that CAN process a high volume of transactions.**\n\nI have to question Stephen Pair\xe2\x80\x99s motives in this article.  It seems clear to me that Bitcoin has two meanings (Bitcoin the currency and Bitcoin the system), and assuming that he is a smart guy (a reasonable assumption), he must know that he is mixing Bitcoin the system with bitcoin the currency to lead to fallacy.  He suggests that some think that \xe2\x80\x9cfrequent payments should be assisted by third parties,\xe2\x80\x9d and if this is the case, Bitpay would be well positioned to prosper if the Bitcoin payment network were greatly constrained.  Accordingly, it seems that he may possibly be engaging in a bit of doublespeak to say that he wants to see Bitcoin remain decentralized cryptocurrency (while able to handle large amounts of payments), BUT while actually advocating for solutions that will weaken the decentralized nature and still require third parties (Bitpay?) for mass use.': 10, 'Good write-up.': 3, 'Since when were u elected to speak on behalf of everyone?\n\nRegardless, its not the number of people who decide, Bitcoin is not a democracy.

Before gold was used for settlement, it was a widely accepted form of payment.\n\nThis completely garbles the point. Gold wasn\'t used as a **non-settlement** payment system first; it was used as cash, direct payment with no counterparty risk - complete and final settlement such that you don\'t actually need the word "settlement"!. \n\nThe concept of "settlement" only arose after secondary payment layers on top of gold (IOUs, certificates) became commonplace.': 26, "With gold, settlement and payment are one and the same.

You can open a channel - worth 1 BTC - with Starbucks by paying them 1 BTC of your own, and getting back 0.99 BTC. Starbucks doesn't need to match with 1 BTC of their own. 0.01 BTC goes to Starbucks for your coffee, and 0.99 BTC goes back to you.

Bitcoin is currently in the process of being valued by the free market (aka price discovery).

A Bitcoin run by a cartel of miners can have a perfectly uncorrupted ledger and function normally. It just stops being very interesting if it turns out to be a psuedo-centralized blockchain.\n\nThe reality is that Bitcoin has had a massive shift towards mining centralization in China. These are the four main points on the issue I posted in the last big thread we had on here:\n\n1) The government subsidized power that enables Chinese farms to operate with extremely low overhead.\n\n2) The fact that due to 1) and other factors(hardware manufacturing is probably one), mining continues to centralize in China.\n\n3) Many technically inclined people whose opinions I respect have suggested that larger blocks will contribute to further mining centralization due to the Great Firewall slowing the relaying of their blocks. Since Chinese miners are pseudo-segregated from the rest of the world, this results in them being more likely to build off of each others blocks since there's no firewall slowing their domestic connections down. Some people believe that bigger blocks will actually re-decentralize Bitcoin mining though, because of the Great Firewall. If that's so people should be bringing this issue to the forefront and debating it, it's a big deal.\n\n4) China has an authoritarian one party government. In the future they may have reason to believe that the existence of Bitcoin is at the very least assisting in capital outflows, and what they might view as harming their economy. There are many different situations that could result in the Chinese government seeing Bitcoin as a threat. We know that a single entity controlling 50% of the hash is a huge issue were it to occur, and the idea that the Chinese government might one day decide to take control of mining farms on their soil isn't exactly the most far fetched idea.": 4, "> In this state Bitcoin is arguably a failed project from a decentralization perspective.\n\nI'm going to parrot what I always say in this context. Just because 90% of mining power is in the hands of 10-20 people does *not* have anything like the same implications as having a currency under the control of central banks. The difference is openness. All transactions are broadcast in public, verified in public. Miners can censor, if they collude, but they would do so at enormous risk to their own business **because we would all see it immediately**. This is *nothing like* current payment systems, where you cannot route around the censorship, and have no option to fork. The threat of a radical fork hangs heavily over the heads of any set of miners who decide they want to censor Bitcoin transactions.\n\nEven with relatively high mining concentration, it's still decentralized because there's no *enforcement* of that particular concentration - it can change at any time. Meanwhile there *is* enforcement of honest behaviour.\n\nOf course I don't mean to imply that there is *no* issue with mining being in too few hands, but only that it's nothing like the same kind of problem as is considered by people who are not thinking carefully. And the fact that we allow competition and the best mining to rise to the top is exactly what's allowed Bitcoin to achieve such a ridiculously high level of security against *external* attack.

Also, it is rather rare for Core to access these files except for the few highest-numbered ones, and when it does it usually reads them sequentially.
