In response to the economic crisis, and the limitations imposed by the government on their ability to make bank withdraws, there have been reports that many Greeks have begun using the digital currency Bitcoin.  Bitcoin also continues to grow in popularity with many Americans.  What, if any new regulations do you think should be imposed on Bitcoin and other digital currencies?  What, if anything, does Bitcoin's raising popularity say about the public's view of the Federal Reserve's conduct of monetary policy? \n\nThe federal banking agencies generally have limited authority over the operation of digital currency systems.  For example, the Federal Reserve's authority over digital currency products is limited to its authority over a supervised entity that issues or exchanges digital currency or clears or settles transactions related to digital currency.  Where a banking organization supervised by the Federal Reserve provides services to a business or individual that is an administrator or exchanger of a digital currency, the Federal Reserve seeks to ensure that the banking organization fully complies with all applicable regulations, such as the Business Software Alliance requirements, and is adequately addressing risks posed by this type of activity.  Other federal and state regulators may have different authority over digital currency products or participants specific to their mandates. \n\nThe costs and benefits of developing new statutes or regulations related to digital currencies should be weighed carefully.  New regulation, such as the creation of special licenses for digital currency providers may work to strengthen the soundness of virtual currency schemes and increase public trust in the products, as some may refrain from investing in or using digital currencies due to a perceived legal uncertainty and/or lack of consumer protection.  On the other hand, new regulation would need to be flexible enough to address effectively the evolving nature of digital currency systems and technology while not stifling innovation. \n\nIt is important to note that bitcoin and other digital currencies are only the latest of many innovations in payment systems.  Any new statute or regulation should consider digital currencies in the context of these other innovations to assess if digital currencies pose significantly different or greater risks that would warrant new statutes or regulations for a specific innovation in the payment system.  We do not interpret bitcoin's popularity as having a relationship with the public's view of the Federal Reserve's conduct of monetary policy.

I'm always interested in the tech, so I took a look at (what I could see) of their technical infrastructure:\n\n* UI is very neat and clean - using ReactJS & Webpack to split assets into commons bundles and per-page bundles to keep the loading fast and individual payloads small. This is a very good sign that they have a competent frontend team.\n* Design is great.\n* Features appear very complete. They have individual controls for the types of emails you want to receive, comprehensive security controls, and forced 2FA. Integration with Authy was completely painless; entered my phone number and got a notification in less than a second. Well done.\n* Appears they're using Webpack even for the image assets, so they have hashed filenames - could be wrong on this. Needs a tweak as it appears to be producing new hashes for the same content, causing a redownload of images.\n* Using React will pay off dividends in the future as they iterate on their infrastructure. The version they're using is old (released nearly a year ago).\n* Controller architecture appears to be very similar to angular/ruby controller/service arch, not something like [Flux](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/flux-overview.html). Still tenable given the low complexity of the site.\n* There's some bundle bloat. They're including React along with jQuery and jQuery UI, inlined fonts, Highcharts, custom SVG and more. Some optimizations could be done here but at least it's being cached well. Production optimizations don't appear to be turned on for React.\n* Debug calls are making it into the bundle - Gemini devs, if you're reading this, see [strip-loader](https://github.com/yahoo/strip-loader).\n* Some stringified Sass code and comments made it into the bundle. Looks like they're reusing code by parsing the Sass variables with a regex. To be honest, interesting solution and code reuse (single source of truth).\n* Some routes need conditional rendering, like [this one](https://exchange.gemini.com/register/institution/thanks) so you can't just navigate to it.\n* Uses proper [Content-Security-Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/CSP/Introducing_Content_Security_Policy) headers, without `unsafe-eval` or `unsafe-inline`! This is great. Most exchanges do not do this. If there is an XSS vulnerability this can be a big help on modern browsers. Unfortunately it makes a lot of exceptions for external services such as Google Analytics & Google Ads (?)\n* Uses [Strict-Transport-Security](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/HTTP_strict_transport_security) - great.\n* https://static.gemini.com is AWS CloudFront - looks good.\n* Uses typography.com webfonts - this is not good and has been known to cause loading problems on some sites. Aesthetic only. No reason not to self-host webfonts if you're going to use them. Other webfonts are inlined which is good/bad (faster initial load, slower reloads due to lack of caching).\n* Looks like BitPay integration is on the way.\n* Not sure what backend tech is behind the Nginx proxy. It's not leaking a Server header which is good.\n* They're serializing and re-sending the entire page's state every 10s. This is a bit wasteful and could be optimized by using server push via websocket. \n* They're using raven-js/[Sentry](https://getsentry.com/welcome/) for client-side error logging. We use this too and love it.\n* API is almost a direct copy of Bitfinex's API, with some understandable technical fixes (e.g. finex has very inconsistent date formats). Of course, no lending/margin API calls because Gemini doesn't offer that.\n* No WebSocket that we could find; to get real-time data, either they have something that's partner-only or you just have to pound the REST API. I see engine.io/socket.io code in the bundle but it's not being used yet. Probably will go live Thursday.\n* Available [Sandbox](https://exchange.sandbox.gemini.com/)! We don't see this on nearly enough exchanges. Aside from [our own](https://testnet.bitmex.com), it appears the only other exchange doing this properly is [Coinbase](https://public.sandbox.exchange.coinbase.com/). Bitstamp, Bitfinex, Kraken, OKC, and 796 do not provide testing environments. Aside from making this much more difficult for developers, it hints that development may be more ad-hoc than is acceptable for an exchange.\n\nOverall what I've seen of their architecture is a breath of fresh air and much better than most. They clearly hired capable devs. I'll definitely be giving it a try on Thursday.\n\nEdit: Also, a great way to take a look at how it works, for the curious: [Download the React-Devtools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi?hl=en) and [inspect the page](http://i.imgur.com/5V3XZAU.png)!": 50, "Sometimes even with DKIM and SPF it takes some time for a new mail server to build up a positive history.

This is what I feel (a longer post is there on my blog if you desire):\n\nWhy use Raspberry Pi for the hardware when I can so the same using my own computer or a laptop? Why would anyone in their right mind pay 400 dollars for a raspberry pi + an API wrapper?\n\nThe 21Inc Bitcoin Computer is a fully functional bitcoin miner, a full bitcoin node and a micro-payments server. It has been rightly pointed about by many others that it is not economical using it as a standalone bitcoin miner \xe2\x80\x93 one source says you will be able to mine only $38 worth of bitcoins a year, and even that is not certain. 21 Inc has also acknowledged this fact. Another source says that the hardware included with this device is only worth $250 and thus the $399 is actually the price of the hardware + the included API and micro-payment server.\n\nIn my view the aim of 21 Inc is to enable hobbyists and developers come on to the blockchain and start using the (21 Inc + bitcoin) ecosystem to create applications and trade on it via micropayments. 21 Inc is maybe aiming to create a bitcoin platform on which a lot of applications are built using their APIs. If there are a lot of people having the 21 Inc device, it would be very easy for them (with the right kind of applications built on top) to transact with each other using bitcoins for micropayments. At this point in time, to my knowledge, there is no single platform which enables bitcoin transactions using a standard API which allows applications to be built on top of it without charging any transaction fee (happy to be corrected if wrong).\n\nOk so why not build a library of APIs and publish it instead of selling a piece of hardware? The issue with that is that it will have to integrate with a host of bitcoin wallets where the end users will end up paying a transaction fee. It will still not address the issue of privacy and anonymity (as the wallet provider knows who you really are).\n\nIf this device gets smaller and faster (which it should with time due to Moore's law) then you could potentially plug it to your cellphone or refrigerator as a USB drive and thus enable e-commerce on this basis.

People might not hold Bitcoin unless they feel confident others will want it someday (and they were able to interact with such people).  Speculation is a key catalyst for starting that process.  The fact I can buy some, I don\'t even really care to use it or not, in the hopes that it will be worth more, actually benefits you even if you just want to use it and never hold.  The more valuable it gets, the more liquid it becomes, and the more you are able to buy with it without moving the market.  Right now, if you wanted to spend $1M in Bitcoin, it would have significant impact in the liquidity.  If Bitcoin had a $1T market cap, it would be a drop in the bucket.  This benefits all users.  Getting mad that someone is getting rich is silly - they actually help you, even if you are upset they don\'t really want to "use" Bitcoin.': 1, 'Those long sync times sound like a bug or misconfiguration.

It is currently limited by the transaction confirmation time and risk of double spending fraud. There are ways in which this could effectively go down to near zero in the future, like with a widespread use of financial instruments with which to hedge the whole exposure to bitcoins that are being used for trade (from the moment a purchaser gets BTC to the moment the merchant or payment processor gets the desired currency), but this is not a reality today. I think this would require large quantities of BTC being available for borrowing, and many BTC speculators/savers investing significant portions of their BTC into such instruments (trading liquidity for yield). Then all BTC exposure would be borne by speculators and the use as a medium of exchange would have no impact on the price.
