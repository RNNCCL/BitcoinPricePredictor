When you have an account system where a user can login to your own secure website, that's when you stop doing security-sensitive things via email. You simply flag the relevant accounts in the database. You then email them to login. You then build a popup with a button that says 'generate address and return bitcoin', they press it, the logged in user gets checked against the database, a flag is found for his account, a new address is generated and the relevant bitcoin is returned to him.\n\nIt's secure, it's user-friendly, it's easy. \n\nWhat you don't do is go against your OWN security policy ('we will never ask you for your password') which is a definite no-no, because it makes void your entire policy and user agreement if they policies are broken whenever convenient. And it destroys the entire notion of 'NEVER', because the next time someone mails him, he'll think 'never doesn't apply, and I didn't get burned last time, it's probably okay'.

Usually there's zero oversight like that. Every employee gets an email address and they can simply send these messages. Hell there usually is limited oversight on creating and deleting new email addresses, and autonomy over your own email box is standard at most companies that don't have elaborate corporate policies on this.

I\'m especially on board with civil disobedience. . . but these things are all done frequently already, and have little impact, if not counter-productive results.  And why?  Because too often, the people doing them don\'t have the correct intellectual framework backing up their very visible and public action; and they are usually barking up the wrong tree completely (see: occupy wallstreet).  Civil disobedience is primarily a PR campaign anyway. . .everything essentially comes down to making the wider public aware of and sympathetic to your cause.  Your cause against police brutality fails, if you protest and rage and get one police department to fire or indict one of their own, or even change their policies. . . because the wider institutional problem still exists (i.e. government monopolizing law enforcement).  When you protest racial inequality, and even if you get laws passed enforcing some kind of racial equality; it fails, unless the culture and mindset of the wider public at large has changed.  Child labor ended in the U.S., not primarily because of the protests or even the laws (which were passed long after most egregious child labor had ended); it ended because the people of the united states became economically productive enough to not need to send their kids to a factory, but instead sent them to school.  Pot prohibitions are finally beginning to be repealed. . . not because of the protests themselves, only a little due to the long-running and widespread use of pot despite prohibitions (i.e. civil disobedience). . . but primarily because people are now becoming educated and aware enough to see that they were lied to about the dangers of the substance, and that the consequences of prohibition are far worse than any of the consequences of use of the substance (both through understanding the medical literature, and by seeing the reasonable and responsible use of the substance by all the civilly disobedient people).\n\nEverything fails against the might of overwhelming public perception and/or ignorance.  Democratic republics exist because that is what people overwhelmingly believe is the most beneficial (or only) form of workable governance over society.  Monarchies existed because people believed in the divine right of kings.  No amount of sabotage or protesting would have, or is going to change that.  Only workable alternatives, for people to be able to view empirically as a workable alternative, and education regarding the theoretical virtues of rule by the people over rule by a dictator. . . only by witnessing the prosperity of places like Hong Kong and Singapore, and seeing ZEDEs and seasteads and secession movements produce freedom and stability; and by people being educated in correct economics; will the wider culture and attitude change towards the necessity of monopoly states.\n\nSimilarly, prohibitions against bitcoin and onerous regulations and taxes will not cease, but will only grow worse; so long as public perception and culture are turned against cryptocurrencies.   And just to be clear, I\'m not one of these people fretting over and clamoring for "mainstream" adoption of Bitcoin, nor am I too terribly concerned with its public image right now.  I understand that world events and undercurrents of decentralization are increasingly pushing people towards black markets, and default civil disobedience anyway.  Governments and TPTB are making their own bed, and creating their own downfall.  What will be built up in the wake of it all, depends entirely upon the mindset of people at large.  As governments drive people more and more to black markets, and the need for anonymity tools, and for monetary independence, they will necessarily see and be educated in how non-state solutions work (such as bitcoin for money, and blockchains as part of private law and arbitration). . . and as the world recovers from the inevitable destruction caused by statism; they may not be much wiser from a theoretical standpoint, but they will have learned to defer more to market-based solutions, rather than state monopolized services.\n\nThere is no quick or easy road to enlightenment.  But the world is getting better overall (even if it is sometimes two steps forward one step back), and the people building tools to help people help themselves are the one\'s doing the most to make it better.\n\nDisobey immoral and counterproductive laws. . . by all means.

': 1, '[deleted]': 2, '>I think it contradicts what you said.\n\nHow does the fact that child labor is more prevalent in agriculture (and not surprisingly corresponds with looser restrictions) contradict what I said?\n\n>You said child labor was going to end anyway because it wasn\'t necessary anymore, yet the one area that wasn\'t covered by child labor laws is still well known for abusing child labor.\n\nI think it was obvious from the context that I was referring to the really nasty, brutish sort of factory work which we would recoil at now.  And that\'s the point, we recoil at the thought of sending our own children to do such hazardous work. . . .and we\'re wealthy enough not to.  Unless of course, you are asserting that 1. if child labor laws were repealed right now, that people would start sending their children to work in dangerous jobs en masse, and 2. that the parents of the children who sent them to work in factory jobs throughout the 19th century and before hand were simply ignorant monsters. . . . both of which assertions are ridiculous and you\'re living in a state-indoctrinated fantasy land if you believe this.  \n\nIn any case, when parents did or do send their kids to work, could it possibly be that the opportunity costs of not having the children go to work were worse?  Something tells me you\'ve never been really, really hungry in your life.  I have.  I\'ve also worked on farms as a young kid.  Now I don\'t know what labor laws there were or weren\'t that might have specifically "protected" me from doing such labor. . . but I can tell you right now, that as begrudgingly as I did that work, it was better for me than the alternative.  Obviously, certain types of jobs have different demands, like farm work, and certain people in certain industries are still not wealthy enough in general to afford to completely forego the use of their children (or other peoples\' children) as hands on the farm.  There\'s also an ingrained culture there, and I\'m sure that had a lot to do with the successful lobby for leniency on child labor in agriculture.  A lot of children still work in other fields too: acting in television and movies, newspaper routes, etc.  Are these exploitative?  Would these kids or society as a whole be better of if they were simply prohibited from working at all?  Why would we think that a central agency could make that choice better than the children and their parents?  \n\n>The only way something like child labor is going to end completely is through laws, \n\nWell, I never said that general prosperity ended or could end child labor completely. . . more importantly, I\'m not so sure that ending it completely is a good thing.  You seem to be, again, completely ignoring that less than 7% of children were in the workforce by 1930, 8 years before the fair labor standards act was passed.  Now how did that happen?  There were a few other state-level laws, but nothing comprehensive or thoroughly enforced and certainly not nationally.  But what there was in spades was a national revulsion towards the practice of putting kids in these unsafe jobs, and many movements to get laws passed.  You see, the laws didn\'t pass first, thereby forcing prudence upon a monstrous and greedy population of child abusers. . . .rather, people desired and demanded a change in conditions, thereby prompting the laws; which were largely only ceremonial by the time the laws passed.  Not surprisingly public will to pass and universally enforce such laws was lacking until such time as the economic necessities which prompted the conditions in the first place were largely alleviated.\n\n>because there are always people who are willing to exploit whatever means necessary to make a buck.\n\nYes, this is the very simple-minded retort of the state-educated mind who can\'t see 2 steps past the unholy spectre of greed.

When Visa charges everyone a 3% fee off the top to cover their insurance risk, this means that people consume fewer goods (since everything they use their card for is 3% more expensive either because the customer pays it upfront or because the supplier eats the fee and can produce fewer goods, shifting their supply curve upward as in the case of a classical pigouvian tax).  There is no deadweight loss of bitcoin due to thievery, unless perhaps maybe it is the case that people are so put off by bitcoin thievery that they fear even using it.  That might be the case, but that is a technical hurdle that is clearly being overcome slightly more every day as companies like Circle and solutions like multi-sig become more accessible.  Moreover, this isn\'t really deadweight loss... it\'s more like "bitcoinweight loss."  The reason is that the money people decide not to spend with bitcoin (due to fear of thievery) will be spent in dollars, stimulating the economy by an equal amount.  The only time this would be damaging is if someone only used bitcoin, but we can assume if that\'s ever the case, common hackers will no longer be an issue [such as in the possible case that hardware wallets are integrated into cellphones].\n\n\n*** only in comparison to other media of exchange.

I was replying to a guy who thinks bitcoin is going to make banks obsolete.": 2, 'That is non-obvious.': 1, 'The reason Factom uses tokens (we call them Factoids) is to represent and exchange the rights to obligate the protocol to record an entry.   If you have a Factoid, you will be able to require the protocol to record your entries.  And some sort of limit is required if you are going to avoid a protocol filling with useless spam and DOS attacks.\n\nRequiring users to have Factoids to use the protocol would force everybody to have to buy Factoids to use the protocol.  That might be a big win for us behind the protocol, but we don\'t want to force people to hold Factoids.\n\nSo how can we avoid a token, and still avoid spam and avoid requiring our users to have to buy our token?\n\n**Of course, we could centralize Factom.**  That was my original design.  Then we could accept Bitcoin or even dollar payments, and place entries into Factom.  This would utterly destroy the protocol, because no matter what, people do not want a centralized system with centralized points of failure if the protocol is going to be central to their business.\n\n**Or (being from Texas) we could do a "two step"**. We added to the Factoids the idea of Entry Credits.  We have a special transaction to convert Factoids into Entry Credits, and assign those Entry Credits to a specified public key.  These Entry Credits are non-transferable, and non-refundable.  Entry Credits are required to create chains and add entries to chains in Factom.  Entry Credits are only useful to create chains and add entries into Factom.  Oh, and to have a voice in managing the protocol.\n\nEntry Credits provide nothing more than access to the protocol.  They cannot be traded.  They are clearly not an appcoin.\n\nThe Servers that collect and record entries are voted into the Federated Server pool by those people actually using the protocol (Have Entry Credits or have purchased entries).   These Federated Servers are paid in Factoids to run the protocol by the protocol.\n\nNow here is where it all gets interesting.\n\n**The servers in the Federated Server pool have Factoids, and users want to put entries into Factom**.  Yet for the most part users *don\'t want Factoids*.  They just want to *use the protocol*.  \n\n**Users can buy Entry Credits with Bitcoin** from the Federated Servers.  Entry Credits assigned to the public keys provided by the Users.\n\nFactoids get paid by the protocol to the Federated Servers, who then sell Entry Credits, effectively returning the Factoids to the protocol.  Now clearly such servers will want to take Bitcoin over other payments, but that will be up to the servers.  Furthermore, the Federated Servers might rather sell the Factoids to a store to handle sales and such.  The Federated servers can do so, because Factoids are just tokens.\n\nWithout Factoids, we can\'t set this up.  Bitcoin has to go to a specific address.  How do we create a protocol that distributes such payments without central control?  Without Factoids, we cannot reward servers for simply participating in the protocol. \n\nAnd without the Entry Credits, we cannot shield users from the underlying tokens.\n\n**Factoids+Entry Credits both allow decentralization, and avoid users from having to mess with the appCoin.** So what we have done with Factom is our best effort to balance the need for a token to build a decentralized solution, with the need of our users to avoid any exposure to the underlying token.': 1, 'I prefer Bitcoin :)': 2, 'Yes, it is programmable digital cash. But it has no credit mechanism. You can build a "bitcoin bank" as in a bank which deals in bitcoin. It could even make bitcoin loans, charging interest in bitcoin. It could pay interest on deposits in bitcoin. But that function - credit - would be another layer above, just as it\'s another layer above deposits today in US dollars.\n\nClearly bitcoin and the technologies around it could, and probably will, create very different types of financial institutions, for example using proof of reserve, and using multisignature to create new security options. But Bitcoin *itself* doesn\'t replace the bank - in the literal sense of an average person taking all their savings out of a bank and putting it in (even a cold storage) wallet, it was never designed to do that. It was designed as cash.\n\nSome people *might* use it like that, as a souped-up, improved version of putting money under a mattress.

Projects that can be funded get done, those that can not get funding don't.

Going forward, the rewards are paid out to insure those running the protocol are paid the majority of the factoids very quickly.  And the architecture is uniquely designed to support store front interfaces that eliminates the need of customers to hold factoids.\n\nIn the end, we will not have a position relative to Factom that has any advantage at all built into the protocol.  Our software license is the most open possible.  The only rewards anyone will have is just some of the factoids which itself will be openly disclosed.  Everyone contributing will get a share.

This surprised me, and to be frank I don\'t believe it. But I don\'t care much, and haven\'t continued to say that the the issue was raised because Bitcoin core\'s updates disrupted patches viacoin was carrying it, despite the appearances.\n\nThe situation is really simple: I wrote the patch for Bitcoin, I suggested that /u/btcdrak rebase it to Bitcoin master to familiarize himself with it and the code in question. (and of course to ensure there would be another set of yes on the code) While going through that process he realized that design changes to the consensus critical code had been made that meant the patch wouldn\'t *mechanically rebase* cleanly. So he explored it on Viacoin - which has been following Bitcoin master on nearly an up-to-date basis and has 1:1 code compatibility - to see how the patch could be rebased. Again, Viacoin wasn\'t carrying this patch before - I could have just as easily posted to bitcoin-development saying "Hey! I\'m not sure all these changes are a good thing." - but I thought giving some context by referring to a specific case where it caused an would be useful. I\'m rather annoying that\'s being used as the basis of yet another silly Bitcoin-vs-alts argument.\n\nThere\'s no pull-req against Bitcoin Core yet because our plan was to add enabling it as a command line option - not as a softfork yet - so potential CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY users could easily test their code and try out applications using the feature. I just haven\'t gotten a chance to write that. You\'ll note that I was trying to *avoid* controversy by not making BIP65 a pull-req right away back when I proposed the feature, as I wanted to set the right tone that it wasn\'t to be a feature I was trying to get adopted quickly, and I wanted it to go through a proper period of review.\n\nAnd stop trying to imply I\'m not supporting work towards a consensus library. Hell, as far as I know I was the first person to suggest the idea in the first place and argued for it quite strongly as a way to decentralize and depoliticise Bitcoin Core development. My post to bitcoin-development quite clearly supported it and suggested a less risky way to implement one than the approach being taken that I think would better balance benefits and risks.

(I did not "predict a blockchain fork on twitter") That got followed up by a throwaway account making lots of rapid-fire accusations and noise in the same thread - I\'d suspect the same person. Then you have /u/nullc repeatedly misstating the situation in the thread, for instance by trying to portray the situation as one of Viacoin having difficulty with merging changes, when we\'re quite clearly concerned about overall development practices and the risks being taken with regard to consensus-critical code.

I will not use any browser based wallet that generating private key in client side and will not suggest it to others.": 1, 'you\'re thinking of it more like bitcoin wallet -> bitcoin wallet.\n\nwith Circle(who i like), you\'re ASKING them to withdraw it to a wallet of your choice. if they decide "no" for any reason(legitimate or otherwise) then the answer is "no."\n\nObviously with an actual btc wallet/key they would have no control here.': 1, "Well it really depends on your political ideology towards money. Blockchain.info doesn't store your keys exactly, it's more like an online interface to self-stored keys. That sits well with a lot of the bitcoin crowd who enjoy this financial autonomy, it's politically a statement that says 'I control my money'.\n\nBut to say it's therefore decentralized or the most secure is nonsense. Blockchain.info is a centralized service with lots of possible weak points. It's not infallible just because it doesn't store keys. And it's not like you don't put 100% trust in Blockchain.info either everytime you use them. If they changed their website to actually save keys on your next login, they'd get access to millions of dollars before anyone would find out. We trust them not to do this everytime we use the service, exactly like Circle. We trust them not to mess up their code so that we have secure keys (they messed this one up just last week), just like we trust Circle not to mess up their code.\n\nThe difference is that if Circle did this because of a rogue or a careless employee, you're insured for that. If johoe stole all the money at blockchain.info, you'd be fucked. At Circle? You'd be insured.\n\nOf course the difference is also that if the US government appropriates Circle's database and gives them a gag-order, they could steal all our money and we wouldn't know what happened. While at Blockchain.info, they could appropriate the database, but they couldn't steal money. They could require blockchain.info to save keys though and give them a gag order that they were doing so, and blockchain.info could choose to close down the company instead. In that scenario, Circle isn't the best choice. \n\nBut one can wonder how likely that scenario is. I'd say you have much more to fear from an employee fuckup like happened last week, or an employee theft, both like happened every single year with Mt. Gox being the biggest fuckup ever, than the US government seizing Circle's private keys.\n\nUnless you're Snowden or a criminal, and in that case you probably want to run Armory on a cold storage laptop anyway, so the blockchain vs circle discussion doesn't seem relevant here. If I was either of those two, I wouldn't touch blockchain.info or circle.\n\nIn other words, I'd suggest anyone, personally, to just use Circle or Coinbase for your hot wallet, unless they have a reason to hide something (which is perfectly fine), in which case I'd suggest Armory or something rather than Blockchain.info, but bc.info isn't a bad choice either. And for your cold wallet where you keep 90% of your funds or whatever, also use say Armory. But that's me. And I say this with lots of respect and admiration for blockchain.info, I like them, they've been hugely instrumental, but it's got an uninsured point of failure that Circle doesn't have and we've seen this last week. \n\nSo I keep 90% of my savings cold, with personal responsibility and autonomy, and 10% in my hot wallet insured with Circle. I fully appreciate that this is a personal choice, in a different situation I might have chosen entirely differently but this works for me.\n": 1, 'Oh really? How do you know this? Just curious since you seem so sure that "Bam, your bitcoin is gone if Circle decided to"': 1, "Intent don't mean they can achieve it ": 2}}}
