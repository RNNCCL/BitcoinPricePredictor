It is technically possible to embed files (smallish ones, not videos) in the blockchain, but that's expensive and wasteful.\n\nWhat *is* more practical, and you may have heard about this and misunderstood it, is to timestamp data in the blockchain. You take a large file, and make a sha256 hash of it; that's only 32 bytes but is effectively a unique 'stamp' of that file - no other file would generate the same hash. You can then embed that 32 bytes of data in the blockchain and by doing so, prove that you had access to the file at that point in time. This kind of thing could be useful for property rights, among other things.\n\nBitcoins are not sent over the blockchain; Bitcoin transactions are embedded in it, which transfer property rights over specific chunks of bitcoin from the owner of one private key to another. Basically.": 9, 'It\'s difficult to answer in a very general way. But, consider that historically ownership was controlled by violence. More recently, we have had various social contracts - still backed by violence. The concept of \'rule of law\' - with laws being set by some kind of modulated \'voice of the people\', ideally. This new approach is more \'rule of algorithm\'. To the extent that the Bitcoin blockchain cannot be shut down, it is a new way of defining ownership; my ownership of a particular chunk of bitcoin is not assessed by any government and cannot be (short of a complete shutdown of modern communications technology). Think controlled by the strong -> controlled by the elected -> controlled by no one.\n\nIt has become trendy to say "it\'s not Bitcoin but the blockchain" that\'s important. I *mostly* disagree, although it\'s a complex issue. The missing part of the discussion is the consensus mechanism. Bitcoin only gets the magical "consensus between untrusted participants" through its proof of work consensus mechanism, which itself works because of the incentive structure. Take out the incentive structure and you lose the consensus without trust property, which means that all you have is a big distributed database where you have to trust the participants in some way. A \'blockchain\' in that case is just a fancy version of a linked list. A lot of the people who say "it\'s not Bitcoin but the blockchain" are looking at it in a very shallow way.\n\nYes, smart contracts are interesting but not in themselves world changing because they still need to be enforced.

But because this event would more than likely bankrupt most people, they are not confident they can do without it.\n\nIt's all about isolated confidence for a merchant.

Double-spends after 30 seconds are very hard to pull off.\n\nI had a problem with using numbers as probabilities without justification.\n\nIf I were to ask "how many merchant transactions have been reversed ever", it\'s likely under .1%. So that\'s your prior for any given transactions being reversed. You\'d need significant evidence pointing towards a transaction being reversed before you get anywhere near 50%.\n\n(You may be confusing it with the probability of a double-spend succeeding after a given length of time, which is easier to calculate, given their hashing power. See e.g. https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1946jp/how_to_calculate_the_probability_of_a_double/.)\n\nBut if an attacker has a 50% chance of double-spending, say, that doesn\'t mean there\'s a 50% chance of any transaction being reversed. If only 1 in 100,000 customers (say) had enough hash rate to attack, then the probability of any one transaction being reversed is 1 in 200,000.\n\n>It\'s all about isolated confidence for a merchant. We are not trying to raise concerns about bitcoin transaction security as a whole, simply explaining in a basic way the process of how merchants can evaluate the risk in a method they already understand.\n\nThe thing is, you aren\'t giving probabilities, you\'re giving made up numbers. If you want probabilities, you should give a number much closer to 0%, to reflect the real probability. There\'s also a cost to carrying out a fork attack, which is huge compared to any individual transactions that would be taking place through chainpay.\n\nLook through https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Double-spending and all the papers linked from there to get a better understanding of the real probabilities of success and the likelihood of reversal.\n\nIf you are talking about probability of an attack succeeding  conditioning on someone trying to reverse a transaction, then you need to both make that clear, and make clear assumptions about how much the attacker is putting into it.\n\nOh, and one thing I didn\'t comments on before:\n\n>By understanding all the factors involved, there will always be a miniscule probability that a transaction could be reversed. The only way to clear this completely is have a level of trust that exists outside the Bitcoin network, a guarantee from the company handling the payment that even if a disaster befalls the Bitcoin network, or a very small probability of a transaction failing actually occurs the merchant will be protected.\n\nSo now I\'m being pedantic, but even if chainpay gives a guarantee, there\'s still a chance chainpay goes bankrupt and doesn\'t pay it.

": 4, "Most videos have a habit of complicating an actually very simple process.\n\nMining in a single sentence:\n\n----\nMiners hash continually changing block headers using SHA256 until the resulting hash is lower than some threshold value, which will make it a valid block.\n----\n\nSHA256 is a hashing algorithm. You can think of hashing as encrypting something with no decryption key in existence: it's a one-way street. The resulting hash from SHA256 *over* arbitrary data (which results in 256 bits of data) is unpredictable, meaning the chances of the first bit being 0, is 50%, the first 2 bits being 0 is 25%, 3 - 12.5%, 4 - 6.25%, etc.\n\nIt follows, that if you want a hash with 4 leading zeroes, you'd have to do roughly 16 hashes over random data before you have a decent chance of *randomly* finding a hash which has 4 leading zeroes. Essentially, this is what mining is. We're looking for hashes with a shitload of leading zeroes (put simply). Currently we're looking for about 65 or so leading zeroes before the network agrees the block is valid. This means you need to do 1/0.5^65 hashes before you have a decent chance of finding one. So about ~3.6*10^19 hashes.\n\nThe data you're hashing are the block headers, these are 80 bytes of data containing some values: block version number (4 bytes), previous block hash (32 bytes), merkle root (32 bytes, combined hash of all transactions), a timestamp (4 bytes), difficulty/bits (4 bytes, which you can calculate the threshold value from) and a nonce (4 byte number which increments after every hash). Changing a single bit in the block headers (from either the nonce, merkle root and/or timestamp headers) will change the resulting hash completely. Typically what miners will do is increment the nonce, hash, check if it's valid, and repeat (until it's valid).\n\nThe other thing that miners do is verify transactions and process them into the block. This is reflected in the merkle root in the headers. (Note: Transactions do not have to be between 2 parties, they can be anything.)\n\nHere's a mining simulator which could help you visualize the whole thing:\n\nhttp://jornc.github.io/bitcoin-transaction-explorer/": 5, "Mining does both.  And critically, it needs to do both (as well as get produce a reward).\n\nWhen a block is mined, all included transactions and a reference to the last block are locked in.  Thus an ordered list of transactions is created.  Everyone can see this list and then agree that Alice did pay Bob 2.13 bitcoin on July 4th, 2014 (as an example).\n\nSolving the hard math problem (SHA256 hash with many leading 0s to be exact) proves that 'a lot' of work was done to extend the list of transactions.  Without this, anyone could create their own list (Charlie could say that Alice actually paid _him_ 2.13 bitcoin on July 4th, 2014).\n\nAnd the reward for mining encourages people to try and be honest - as you can make more money from mining 'honestly' than you can from trying to thwart the system.": 1, "coyno is a service to help with your tax report, I don't know much use it has as a watch only wallet. but importing your xpubkey is something useful, i'm not sure if www.coinreporting.com offers this": 1, "> There's almost zero developer support for Gavin's proposed 20MB block size limit,\n\nI'm personally in favor of a more gradual increase in block size, such as doubling every 105,000 blocks (~2 years), starting with the next reward halving.  That's easy to program, and allows miners to gradually shift to fees as the block reward goes down.\n\nThat would take us to 2 MB in about 2016, and 16 MB in 2022.

There are "core developers" which have major influence on what the software powering the Bitcoin network does, and there are ecosystem developers, programmers that create software and services that run on top of the network, like exchanges, wallets, or providers like BitPay. \n\nThere is differing support community wide for Gavin\'s proposal, with many ecosystem developers, who are as key as core developers, in clear support. Within the group of core developers that have push access to the Github code I don\'t think it\'s accurate to say there is zero support. It\'s more accurate to say there is not yet (and may never be) unanimous consensus it\'s the right thing to do. It doesn\'t take unanimous consensus to make a change.

BIP 32 and related standards proposals are not implemented consistently across wallets yet. So even if a web wallet does offer this feature, there\'s no guarantee that that extended public key you export can be used with the Web wallet.\n\nEven if such a service were available, you might want to consider the privacy implications of using it.

How can a protocol, which is not an entity b a means of messaging between entities, escrow anything? It cannot. BUT! what a protocol can do is define a means of creating an irrevocable bond. Traditionally, we use escrows to make bonds irrevocable. But in the case of Ethereum et al we are using a byzantine-fault tolerant consensus system to ensure that the bonds made between any mapping of the system\'s users will be honored.\n\nSo, for starters we are discussing bonds which are peer-to-peer, not escrows which **require** an intermediary.\n\nSecondly, this bond does not require a store of value be defined within the protocol. It may be that the value bonded is external to the smart contract system. It is true that this is a weaker form of smart contract, but it is still a protocol that provides the means of verifying the performance of a contract.

I can tell you with much higher certainty how many Bitcoins will be mined. \n\nYou will not get a better result than this and you need to stop blowing the topic out of proportion. It is not a problem, so stop trying to make it out to look like it is.\n\nEdit: You also need to appreciate that Bitcoin\'s rise in value will have huge knockon effects for the rest of the Bitcoin economy. It encourages investment, greater liquidity, spending, etc. More coins being dumped also cools heads and stabilises speculative buying. The Bitcoin economy will grow in fits and starts, I doubt it will be a steady rise for many years but it is demonstrably evident that Bitcoin\'s volatility has lessened over the years.': 2, "This is a solution looking for a problem.  You never even elaborated on how they get put back into circulation.  Are you just going to award 12 year unspent outputs to a miner on the next block after the 12 year period hits?  Don't you think the possiblity of 1M of Satoshi's bitcoins back into circulation at the 12 year mark would create volatility in itself?  This also could create extremely bad behavior of miners.  Refusing to process transactions containing large unspent outputs if they are nearing the 12 year mark.": 4, "I've been reading through them, it seems pretty similar to the flak I'm getting here as well. People get very defensive about this. It looks like I'm not the first to think of this, though. \n\nWhether or not my idea for fixing it is a good one, I'm still looking for an explanation as to why lost coins are not a problem. In bitcoin, so many coins were mined initially that are now presumed lost that they make up large chunks of the total amount in circulation. \n\nI think the amount of insecurity that introduces into the market is a bad thing. \n": 1, 'I understand you have best intentions here, but in reality you are (unnecessarily) opening a can of worms.\n\n> I don\'t know what you mean by lost coins not being a problem - I spelled one out in my original question: it undermines trust in the system for average users. In what should be a trustless system, that is bad because they don\'t have confidence in the system itself. \n\nYou seem to want to protect the community at the detriment of the individual. IOW, you are implying that the individual should submit to the community. I.e. the communist model. If people don\'t like Bitcoin there are alternatives, no-one is forced to use the Bitcoin system.\n\n> Market price of this uncertainty is already built into the price of bitcoin - but how? People who doubt that all coins are lost and could flood the market at any time are going to value coins less - having lost coins affects the market by reducing the price of bitcoin based on the uncertainty. Remove the uncertainty, the price should rise.\n\nAccording to that logic farmers that strike oil on their property should surrender their gains as it was not deserved or anticipated, otherwise the oil market will be in chaos. Does that sound fair?\n\n> Exactly. I\'m talking about lost coins and the ability of the average non-technically inclined user to trust a system - its the question of whether a coin is lost or simply being held that this idea was meant to address. \n\nThings stabilise, the Bitcoin market is small (but much bigger than it used to be). Every currency fluctuates, and every stock changes in value, nothing is fixed, or guaranteed to be stable. You will not get a fix for this. And anythting that purport sto be a fix is usually something that takes freedom from others "for their own good".\n\n> That\'s not a feasible scenario. Just make the time limit like 20 years or something. You think miners are going to ignore transactions with associated fees to wait 20 years in hopes they\'ll recover a coin? \n\nMiners will take advantage of the situation. Once they see old coins move, unless the user pays exorbitant fees that outweighs the miners incentive to avoid processing the transaction, they will dump it in preference of the funds going back to the block reward mining pool. It doesn\'t matter what the limit is. \n\n> It wouldn\'t be "their money being messed with." Rather, it would be a feature of bitcoin. Think of it like an expiration date. People know that to keep their money they have to use it at least once per decade - or whatever. Also, telling people to start an alt is pretty condescending. Not everyone is a computer programmer, and no alt is ever going to supplant bitcoin, because bitcoin has prime mover advantage.\n\nRead the threads. No-one likes people suggesting these kinds of changes and you can be guaranteed that any controversial change will be rejected. Fluffing it up as "once a decade" or whatever is just as bad. Imagine a massive amount of coins, in ten years expire, more than ten times the current market cap of the Bitcoin economy, is released to miners. What do you think will happen then? Your idea injects economic uncertainty and chaos. It is absurd and foolish. And no I\'m not being condescending about suggesting an alt, if you think the idea is viable, you should make an alt, programmer or not if you think it will be more successful long term then see it through. Pay someone to make the changes, crowd-source it, if you can\'t then it\'s obvious that people don\'t want that kind of system.\n\nIf that doesn\'t satisfy you and you absolutely must have a cryptocurrency here and now that more closely matches your needs, try Ripple.': 2}, ('[List] Twitch streamers that use BTC/ChangeTip', 87): {"Please add what they stream, I'm not gonna visit 20 streamers without knowing what they cast.": 1, '[deleted]': 0, 'The Bitcoin tip for 3,747 bits ($1.00) has been collected by *natmccoy*.\n\n\n[ChangeTip info](https://www.changetip.com/tip-online/reddit) | [ChangeTip video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AnfKpypMNw) | /r/Bitcoin': 1, "Well you can look for certain games on twitch, why can't we look for people who like and use bitcoin?": 1, 'I stream from time to time on twitch and have a link for bitcoin donations.

I\'m not a black market participant, but I love financial privacy and I think that all people should have it. People will paint whatever picture they like about bitcoin, some are very passionate about turning people away from it. Sometimes I think they have good intentions, like trying to steer people away from get-rich-quick schemes and the lottery. (But I think it\'s futile to steer people away from that because playing the lottery is beyond logic. Still, if someone is being scammed, I am not in favor of blaming the victims  - we have to go after the scammers. But bitcoin can be very strongly anonymous and draws in scammers and get-rich-quick types. Even if someone is not very into get-rich-quick schemes, they often get bitcoin and wish it could "work for them" so they wind up wildly increasing their speculative risk / gamble, and go for bitcoin denominated loans, altcoin trading, bitcoin trading, bitcoin denominated stocks, "Initial Coin Offers", and things like that and maybe don\'t realize that having bitcoin is not that kind of game.)\n\nAny crypto currency that took over black markets would be huge.

I\'m in it for the crypto, the math, the computer science, and the left-libertarianism (Freeeeeedom!)\n\n> If an anonymous altcoin takes over most of those markets, might that help protect bitcoin from government repression?\n\nMaybe. But it might also take some of the mask of of government oppression. Bitcoins or an altcoin with unbelievable privacy, could make life better or honestly make it worse. A technology might get forced on people where it becomes very hard to detect bribery of politicians, or where they can loot the treasury of a country and there\'s no where to turn to to find the money or get it returned. Everyone may appear to have no financial assets but somehow still be wealthy tax-evaders like Greece. Government tax collectors might practically become like the old Roman tax collectors and their shakedowns and take tribute from regional places rather than try some kind of "Just" taxation. Who knows? Bitcoin might make the State *more* repressive. If they can\'t print money out of thin air, government might literally just become thugs that tell you to hand over some bitcoin or else you wind up in a prison cell, beaten up, or disappeared. Not exactly a wonderful world!

But for alt-coins I like right now the coins that use ring signatures.  Usually they are cryptonote clones like Bytecoin, or Monero.  I prefer [ShadowCash](http://shadow.cash/) because it is not a clone and is instead a unique implementation built by the devs.  \n\nAlso ShadowCash has the best of both worlds.  It has a transparent chain like Bitcoin, and also an anonymous token that uses ring signatures similar to cryptonote. The anonymous tokens exist in a type of 2-way peg to the main chain, similar to a sidechain.  This also has advantages because it can plug in with existing infrastructure much easier.  This is why for example shapeshift.io has added ShadowCash, but they have not added cryptonote coins yet.\n\n From my understanding the zkSNARKS are a type of cryptographic argument of knowledge that provides the best anonymity.  But right now SNARKS are still in development and not fully trustless. The SNARK technology is still advancing to overcome some obstacles.  Since ShadowCash uses tokens, it may be much simpler than other coins to slot SNARKS in in the future for an even greater level of anonymity.  SNARKS for example allow you to keep hidden the actual amount being sent as well, and they provide better anonymity. \n\nAnother good thing about ShadowCash is that it has a much simpler to use wallet than other coins like Monero.  Monero are still working to develop user friendly GUI wallets.  Shadow has a pretty cool wallet and is the first HTML type wallet I believe.  They have encrypted messaging within the main wallet similar to bit-message.  Also they have an in wallet block explorer.  They have said they plan to launch a decentralized marketplace similar to Open Bazaar within the wallet soon as well.  If they can deliver on that, it would be a pretty amazing project.
