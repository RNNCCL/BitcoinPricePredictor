Answers to some questions:\n\nSummary of the solution at [Slide Share](http://www.slideshare.net/AndyPhillipson1/accept-bitcoin-with-ingenico).\n\nThe solution is available immediately for Ingenico's North American region.  We can service terminals in other regions on demand however we need to obtain the appropriate application signing kit from Ingenico to make the application available in other than NA terminals (there may be a delivery delay here but we are scaling to other than NA geos on demand).  This is a global solution with only our need to sign the application for use in terminals not specifically setup for the NA region.\n\nBitPay can source terminals for your business, install software and configure the terminals for your BitPay merchant account and ship the terminals to you. Each terminal will have a cost associated with its acquisition and setup.  The cost is based on volume; please contact us for specific pricing.\n\nSteps to get setup.\n1. Setup a BitPay merchant account.\n2. Contact BitPay to order terminals.\n3. BitPay ships installed and configured terminals to merchant.\n4. Merchant requires a hard wired Internet connection and power at POS locations.  Plug in, power on, accept bitcoin!\n\nThere is no requirement to engage a PSP or agent but if your business does have a PSP then please inform us and we will attempt to work with your PSP at your request.  \n\nThere is no requirement for the terminal to host any other payment method (e.g., credit card) or for a CC processor to even be involved (this, of course, may depend on your PSP).  The Bitcoin solution works stand-alone.\n\nIf your terminal is a slave to a POS system then we need to know if the POS/terminal can be setup such that the terminal can obtain a direct connection to the Internet (bitpay.com). The terminal must have a direct Internet connection (terminals may proxy through a host).\n\nWe think the best, most cost effective solution is to use the Ingenico iCT250 terminal.  It has good screen resolution for QR code scanning and has an integrated paper receipt printer.  At the conclusion of a sale you can optionally print a complete receipt for your customer.  The receipt has everything the customer needs to reference the sale and request a refund if needed.\n\nFeatures:\n\n* 3 steps to complete a sale, (1.) key in amount of sale, (2.) issue request for payment from BitPay, (3.) customer scans QR code to pay.\n\n* Optionally print a customer receipt at conclusion of sale.\n\n* Highly configurable customer receipts (e.g., print your store name, etc.)\n\n* Print a listing of all sales for the day; great for reconciliation without having to go to bitpay.com (optionally go to bitpay.com to access your order history).\n\n* Handles multiple local currencies simultaneously (tx 1 in USD, tx 2 in EUR, ...)\n\n* Accepts customer tips using amount or percentage of sale (just like the BitPay Checkout App).  Very usable for restaurant sales!\n\n* Employee safe; pin protected setup/configuration.\n\nIf you're using a tablet or mobile phone hosting the BitPay Checkout app then the Ingenico terminal may be a great substitute.  The terminal is easier to use, easier to secure, and less likely to grow legs or be used for gaming ;-)\n\nHope this helps everyone - and thanks for your interest and support!": 69, '> And more fiat dumped for bitcoin (in order to use this).\n\nWhat incentive is there to do that?': 1, 'Have a taste of this instead http://i.imgur.com/7drHiqr.gifv': 3, "I cannot find anything at all on Bitcoin on Ingenico's website.\n\nedit: Nothing about this on bitpay.com either.": 3, "Sooo I take it this would require NFC since the vast majority of these terminals don't have any capability for reading QR codes?

For instance you could have a mobile wallet like [Bread Wallet](https://itunes.apple.com/app/breadwallet/id885251393) or [AirBitz](https://airbitz.co/#app) as well as a wallet on your computer like [Electrum](https://electrum.org/#home) for example.\n\nMost good wallets will have some kind of back-up options which could involve saving an encrypted file, writing down a set of phrases, etc. It's up to you to make sure you are familiar with your wallet's back-up procedure and that it's implemented.\n\nIn order to actually buy Bitcoin, there are different options which you can find here:\n\nhttps://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/\n\nCoinbase.com, Circle.com, LibertyX.com, Bitquick.co, and LocalBitcoins.com are pretty popular and reliable options, although again, it's best to buy your bitcoins then move them to a wallet you control.\n\nHere's a few bits to get you started down the rabbit hole :)\n\n/u/changetip 5000 bits\n\nOnce you get these in your ChangeTip account, try moving some of them to a few other wallets you've setup, that will help you understand better. Then once you get the hang of that, you could start checking out other nifty services like [Fold App](https://coffee.foldapp.com/), [Purse.io](https://purse.io/), or try winning more Bitcoin playing [Chopcoin.io](http://www.chopcoin.io/) for example... or sit on them and hopefully watch the price rise over time :)\n\nLet us know if you have further questions.": 4, "I'd recommend doing two things:\n\nInstall Mycelium app. It has pretty decent security and a great HD backup feature, so you know you will always be able to recover your private keys if disaster strikes.\n\nRegister with a site where you're able to buy bitcoin easily like Coinbase, Circle, Bitstamp, Kraken or similar. Do a little research beforehand as to which exchange has the best service for your specific country.\n\n\nBuy a some bitcoin, transfer to your Mycelium wallet and off you go!": 1, '/u/goldencelery, NimbleBodhi wants to send you a tip for 5000 bits ($1.24).

Most merchants already have a stand beside device and are locked into contracts with it. This is not a way to upgrade those devices to support bitcoin, its a replacement for their existing stand beside that adds bitcoin support.   \n\nThis makes it easier for new or out of contract retailers who decided to add bitcoin to go through that process.': 1, 'Pretty nice to be honest, especially the "requires no extra hardware" part, since current payment terminals can easily cost up to $2000 apiece. \n\nGreat work, BitPay.': 2, "It's strange why this requires a graphics display.

I didn't explain why I don't think it's that impressive and based on the article, it seems we are aligned. Here is where I'm not impressed. \n\nTL;DR They allude to the device being able to be used as the single point of electronic payments (both cards and bitcoins) which is technically possible, but realistically they have just ported their check out app to a traditional payments terminal and left it to the merchants to ask their PSP to support it. \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3nqbpd/pointofsale_giant_ingenico_rolls_out_bitcoin/cvqrw27\n\n>BitPay can source terminals for your business, install software and configure the terminals for your BitPay merchant account and ship the terminals to you. \n\nThis statement tells me that the realistic use of this device is to provide a terminal that only accepts bitcoin payments. This is because in order for this device to be used for card transactions with PINs, the PIN debit key (the key that encrypts the PIN for the debit/check card) would have to be injected into the devices by the Payment Service Provider (PSP)(or 3rd party of their behalf). Bitpay is putting less focus on working with PSPs than it is on being a one stop shop for a payments industry device with software to allow bitcoin payments. \n\n>Each terminal will have a cost associated with its acquisition and setup. The cost is based on volume; please contact us for specific pricing.\n\nHere is a gotcha which means it's probably very expensive to purchase one of these for the sole purpose of accepting bitcoin payments. \n\n>If you're using a tablet or mobile phone hosting the BitPay Checkout app then the Ingenico terminal may be a great substitute. The terminal is easier to use, easier to secure, and less likely to grow legs or be used for gaming ;-)\n\nSo here we have the actual value proposition of the device. BitPay check out app on a traditional payments terminal. \n\nIn order for a merchant to use this device as their single point of electronic payment acceptance, BitPay needs to build relationships with PSPs and work toward getting their app installed on the device when it's ordered from the PSP (PIN debit key already injected).\n\n": 3, 'Excellent article.

He would not be able to use the BitPay solution, at least not according to the slides. The slides show the customer's smart phone looking at a QR code on the POS terminal. The problem is that the customer and his smart phone will be in the main dining room, while the POS terminal is in another room where the bar is located.  Also, there needs to be a convenient way to enter a tip from his smart phone and this has to make it back to the merchant so that the server can get the proper payout.\n\n": 2, "But these challenges of working with PSPs don't always exist. The reason it's a problem here is because they are working with a stand beside payment terminal, meaning, it's not integrated into the POS (although it can be). \n\nThe home run would be to integrate with a POS system (the computer part of the payments tech) instead of the device where a PIN is typed (the PIN Pad). That way, they can support bitcoin payments without the need to work with PSPs at all. They would however have to work with a POS manufacturer. ": 1, 'My understanding is that all the merchants out there, even just the ones using Ingenico terminals, still have various payment services providers (PSPs) who would have to specifically choose to offer Bitcoin integration and push it to their client devices for what you describe to work. A Bitpay account is needed so that the terminal knows who to talk to (thus, why it needs a direct connection to the internet) and so that Bitpay knows who to pay (what business, what bank account).\n\nBitpay is also customizing the software on these devices themselves (loading their own app), thus why the suggested route is to order a terminal from them.

Either people who, stole a wallet or purse that had gift cards in it, stole a credit card and bought gift cards, or flat out ripped off gift cards from someone like a school mate or family member. \n\nThe legitimate people that saw the sign and thought what a cool idea and actually wanted to get rid of their pottery barn gift card realized very quickly that it was a ripoff. The fees were anywhere from 20-50% of the balance depending on what retailer the gift card was from. Nobody that didn't look like a meth head used this program.

Sorry I took so long to respond. Here goes.\n\nI\'ll assume you have bitcoin in a mobile wallet for brevity\'s sake.\n\nAt Starbucks, or before you arrive, visit https://coffee.foldapp.com on your phone. Log in with Twitter or Facebook, or "anonymously".\n\nAside: Anonymous logins keep us from seeing any personal info (other than what every other site sees, and your bitcoin address when you pay). But it relies on browser cookies, so if you clear yours a bunch it can be extra work.\n\nChoose an amount you want to spend. Say, $5. You\'ll see a QR code and payment details requesting $4 in bitcoin. This is where you get the 20% discount.\n\nTap the code or one of the other links, and you\'ll be taken to your mobile wallet, with the amount prefilled. Pay, and go back to youre browser- and you\'ll see a Starbucks voucher.\n\nPay at the register (there are front-facing scanners for the barcode) and enjoy your coffee.

I asked the barista about it and she basically said they served starbucks coffee and got starbucks promotional material but there was no official connection.  Furniture and theme was very similar.": 7, 'It\'s not scalable, if 1% of starbucks customers used it the demand for starbucks gifts cards would increase such that it\'s unlikely foldapp would be able to profitably offer a 20% discount.  The "innovation" of foldapp is about the discount market for gift cards and has very little to do with bitcoin.': 4, 'Not to be pedantic, but if you look, it\'ll say something along the lines of "whatever cafe, proudly serving Starbucks". They just partner with companies like Albertsons or Barnes and Noble who have a cafe, but generally wouldn\'t want a third party business having a presence in their store. It\'s not a traditional franchise, since they\'re not claiming to BE a Starbucks, but you\'re right that the marketing material does seem to confuse a lot of people.

Use the tagging feature in Reddit Enhancement Suite to stay on top of this sort of shit.': 0, "> $12+B a year of gift cards accumulating in purses and drawers is a huge opportunity.\n\nYeah, but what portion of that $12B are actually chains vs small businesses?  Every mom and pop in the country has gift cards now, and you're never going to be able to use the long tail.  And then of that $12B, realistically some huge number of those get lost/forgotten about, not just voluntarily unspent.  \n\nI'd be shocked if your realistic addressable market size were much more than $1B or so. Then capturing some 1% of that would probably be a smashing success.\n\nLike the above poster said, it's really not that big of a market.  There are many other players in the unused gift card space, and have been for years.  On the surface it seems like a ridiculous opportunity because of all the unused cards, but like the parent said, it ends up being thieves and drug dealers.
