The Trezor hardware wallet does basically the same thing but will safe you minutes in doing a transaction.\n\nSome notes on other options. \n\n* Use of Armory Wallet might also be good. But this requires running a full bitcoin node and is overkill for most people. Only look into it if your going to store A LOT of bitcoins. Armory Wallet also needs to be used with an offline PC/liveUSB\n\n* Paperwallets is also an option if you want to store bitcoins in a physical medium. These wallets also need to be created on a offline PC/liveUSB. You can create multiple small wallets and load them when needed to your online hot wallet. Mycelium has support for this feature. \n\nEndnote: Remember that if you make a backup of you keys/seed to never put it on a online pc unencrypted.

The carriers shouldn\'t be interfering in the first place. If you want updates you can switch to another ROM like Cyanogenmod. \n\nRegarding secure isolated software, I\'ve been thinking about similar solutions like that. A secure device which can use hardware switches to disable access for the main OS to the screen and all sensors in order to prevent stuff like spying on the input by listening to the accelerometers, etc. And to prevent "phishing" from malware it would need something like its own LED to signal when it is active and in exclusive control of the screen. ARM already has a mechanism for running software in a way similar to this, which potentially could be used.\n\nOne of the problems with this approach is however that most types of TPM\'s are designed to give the manufacturer control over the user, not to give the user ultimate control.

This is why there are some projects to bypass the internet, e.g. via small dedicated satellites. Another method could be the use of self-organizing adhoc peer to peer networks that propagate information via multiple hops and cannot be censored. With these methods transport delay and Bitcoin propagation times will increase significantly.

On a per-block basis the chances are nearly equal. It's just that twice as many blocks are created in the same span of time, so naturally there will be twice as many orphans.\n\n> But it isn't really the hashing power that makes it secure, is it?\n\nYes it is. That's the fundamental security model of the block chain. Every confirmation adds another 10 minutes worth of hashing power to your transaction security. The more confirmations, the less likely it becomes that this transaction ever gets reverted.\n\nMost exchanges wait for six confirmations to be absolutely sure nobody can undo the transaction.

They overcharge, they don\xe2\x80\x99t really innovate, and they give preferential treatment to big business. For about 10 years, there has been the alternative idea of mesh networking, where we get rid of ISPs and, instead, have Internet messages relayed directly \xe2\x80\x94 person-to-person, laptop-to-phone-to-laptop. Theoretically, this completely solves the problems caused by ISPs. So, why hasn\xe2\x80\x99t it succeeded?\n\nThe reason is that inside of one city, it works fine; but when you need to send a message, say, from Toronto to Sydney, that\xe2\x80\x99s 15,000 kilometers, or 45,000 cell phone and laptop hops, even with optimal hardware. Even that assumes there are nodes going all along the ocean. It\xe2\x80\x99s obviously far too slow and expensive.

Anyone can charge for being a relay node for other people\xe2\x80\x99s messages. And if I want to send a request to some server, I run a graph-search algorithm to find the shortest, cheapest path. So, if you pay a few microcents per kilobyte, your messages get transferred. If you have a phone, you can participate in the network and get a few cents an hour. Large companies can also participate. I could start a company whose sole purpose is to run and maintain a single wire going from Vancouver to Melbourne and collect fees off that. If my wire is the fastest, cheapest way to get messages over, people will use it. If I filter traffic from Wikileaks, then Wikileaks users can just use someone else\xe2\x80\x99s wire instead.\n\nThe result is maximum modularity, minimum barrier to entry, an optimal marketplace.

Anyway shouting doesn't just mean paying - it means 'buying a friend x', usually a consumable good like drinks or dinner, just because a friend is being a friend... Shouting someone is only used amongst friends/family and typically not random strangers (unless you got deep pockets, but there's a different term for that).\n\n\nThe idea I want to use here is to not treat the bitcoin you give as a repayment for the goods received (I mean you can but that's very calculative of you :D), but as an IOU ledger to return the favor later, so that you can remember who to treat (say, if you have a forgetful memory, but I don't, and I want to use this as an experiment to increase bitcoin adoption).\n\n\nBehind the scenes, you ARE giving them money. So when you return the favor & ask for those bitcoins back, there is no economic loss (sans exchange loss/gains and probably the price of the drink/dinner) between your friends - you paid for a friend's food and received bitcoin in return. Next time he/she shouts you again you give 'em some coins again.\n\n\nAnd they can't cheat you by topping up the wallets for more 'favors' that you don't remember - because they're giving you, well, real money.
