Instead, it waits until you authenticate yourself to the bank, using whatever means you normally use (two-factor authentication, whatever). It sits in the browser, so it sees the HTTPS session unencrypted. You enter a command to transfer, say $100 to Alice and the malware changes it to tell the bank to send $1000 to Bob instead.\n\nEven worse, it modifies the information that the banking site is showing you, so what you *see* in the browser is that you have sent $100 to Alice - while the banking site is trying to tell you that you have sent $1000 to Bob.\n\nEven better, it has mobile components infecting Android and Symbian phones when you connect them for syncing with the infected PC. If the bank informs you about the transaction you just conducted via SMS, the malware component on the phone intercepts that SMS and deletes it.\n\nCompared to that, modifying the Trezor firmware image on-the-fly is pretty trivial.

The software processes themselves could be compromised completely, for years, in a blanket dragnet fashion, without anybody knowing. This could be by the data center operator, by an intelligence agency. I hope you have been keeping up, because these things aren\'t "conspiracy theories" anymore, just routine.\n\nAs such, all information about every transaction can still be linked and traced in a blockchain. It is analogous to taking the paper out of a shredder and simply using a program to put the whole document back together.\n\nEvery transaction you send with darksend requires LUCK to not be compromised. And you require that luck to persist until infinity. That is a poor system. The other side of the debate even reinforces this luck, you can get any darkcoin developer to show you a nifty graph of the chances your transaction is compromised, based on how many masternodes were bad actors. Luck.\n\nNow back to the minority masternode operator that doesn\'t use a data center and instead uses a personal PC. Now you are trusting this person to not be data mining for themselves. Hm.\n\nIf you are interested in private cryptocurrency, Monero and Shadowcash are good candidates. They have their own development paths.  Darkcoin is an evolutionary dead end, at one point they were going to implement technology that shadowcash uses (zero knowledge proofs), at one point they were going technology that monero uses (ring signatures and stealth addresses), but each and every time they failed and opted for the masternode dilemma.\n\nIncentivized nodes are a great idea that darkcoin brought to the table!

If we have broad adoption of Factom, then this would be a very, very expensive attack.\n\nFurther, it is unnecessary.  Factom allows you to write to any chain you wish.  So writing your malware into some chain maintained by /u/kenCode doesn\'t require you to elect a server into the Federated Server Pool just to write your entry.   \n\nBut here is the kicker.  The client software using this chain would almost certainly require a signature that requires a private key that the attacker simply doesn\'t have.  So writing your entry will do no good, as anyone iterating over the chain will see that your entry doesn\'t validate, and they will ignore you.\n\nKeep in mind, Factom doesn\'t do much of anything.  It simply allows users of the protocol to create Factom chains, and then write entries to those Factom chains.   It doesn\'t validate, verify, or censor.  That is all done client side.\n\nThe power here is that you must attack the client.  Attacking Factom doesn\'t buy you anything.': -1, "How exactly would this stop malware?

Network participants have a list of unspent outputs, which needs to be accessed very fast, to know, whether a spent is valid or not.\n\n2. Full nodes usually store each and every historical transaction, even if it was already processed.\n\n3. In theory, and this is on the way, participants could "forget" about those outputs that were already spent, basically keeping only the list of unspent outputs, and optionally the recent, or all historical transactions.\n\n4. In the early days, data was encoded as Bitcoin address, which can never be spent, because no one has the private key for it. This is toxic and bloats the "list of unspent outputs" for eternity.\n\n5. State of art is that data is encoded in multisig outputs, where the sender holds one private key to redeem that output, and the other ones embedd the data. This is not toxic, because once this output is spent, it vanished from the list of unspent outputs, and may also eventually be forgotten as well.\n\n6.

': 2, 'Vision for bitcoin beginning to fade\n\nIzabella Kaminska\n\nCryptocurrencies stormed into the public consciousness in November 2013 when the price of just one bitcoin broke through the $1,200 level.\n\nThe activists promoting the new breed of people-issued money claimed it would replace inflationary central-bank currency, enabling consumers to bypass the high commission charges and regulatory restrictions of traditional banks.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt gives everyone in the world access to finance and the ability to transact with each other,\xe2\x80\x9d says Chris Ellis, one of the early supporters who always believed bitcoin\xe2\x80\x99s potential was in democratising finance for millions of unbanked people. \xe2\x80\x9cThe only barrier to entry is the use of a network-enabled digital device like a smartphone or a computer. \xe2\x80\x9c\n\nBut one year on, and despite growing popularity with retailers such as Expedia, Overstock and IBM, an FT look into digital currencies as part of the \xe2\x80\x9cDemocratising Finance\xe2\x80\x9d series shows that things have not turned out as the community intended.\n\nBitcoin prices have collapsed in recent months. For most of January they traded below $250, incurring heavy losses for those who bought in at more frothy levels and challenging the profitability of the businesses involved.\n\nMessage boards once filled with enthusiasts now feature critical voices that question the system\xe2\x80\x99s long-term viability and structure.\n\nBitcoin was the brainchild of the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto presumed today to be the nom de plume of a group of secretive cryptologists.\n\nIt was supposed to provide a way to sidestep third parties \xe2\x80\x94 banks and other foreign exchange providers \xe2\x80\x94 and create an alternative system that could essentially be run by users themselves.\n\nBut its anonymity gained it a reputation as the currency of choice for drug dealers and money launderers, while its volatility brought it to the attention of speculators.\n\nGradually companies are starting to accept bitcoin but its use is limited to a few global corporations and some local businesses keen to jump on a trend.\n\nThere are still concerns over whether mainstream adoption can ever happen in an environment where message-board commenters claim \xe2\x80\x9cconsumer protection is non-existent\xe2\x80\x9d and where price volatility turns even a coffee purchase into an unpredictable expense.\n\nThe high-profile scandals of the past year have included the $620m collapse of the Tokyo-based currency exchange Mt Gox, the theft of $5m coins from Bitstamp, one of the key exchanges based in the UK, and several small-scale frauds, hacks and embezzlements that drain funds from users.\n\nThe bitcoin system processes about 100,000 transactions a day compared with Visa\xe2\x80\x99s 150m. But only about 1 per cent of the bitcoin total represents actual buying and selling of goods and services, with the rest linked to spam, money laundering and double counting, according to Jeffrey Robinson, money laundering expert and author.\n\nMost of all, the newly disillusioned bitcoin community is confused about how a system that was supposed to be decentralised and owned by no one has ended up being anything but.\n\nTim Swanson, a consultant to the industry, says bitcoin is too complex to achieve that goal. Rather than eliminating the need for third-party agents, he says it has spawned a whole industry of people needed to process it.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you introduce third parties it defies the point\xe2\x80\x89.\xe2\x80\x89.\xe2\x80\x89.\xe2\x80\x89All it does is create an extra cost,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cYou just end up replicating the old system, but without the features that provide functionality for customer service.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBitcoin fees for users are low. But they are in effect subsidised by speculative buyers. If prices fall, Mr Swanson warns that fees will rise, making it less competitive versus traditional payment methods. He estimates that the true cost of each bitcoin transaction is $15-$20.\n\nThe smart money, according to one developer of a rival system, was never invested in bitcoin directly but in the supporting infrastructure. These businesses could one day be redeployed to new and improved cryptocurrency systems or even to traditional currencies.\n\nMeanwhile, a growing number of bitcoin intermediaries are moving to work within the established financial market.\n\nCoinbase, the San Francisco-based start-up that lets people store, send and accept payment in bitcoins, has launched its own US dollar wallet service and broke records in January when it raised $75m from investors including the New York Stock Exchange and several banks.\n\nThe presence of traditional financial services companies and figures was interpreted as an indicator of growing investor interest in mainstream applications of the digital currency.\n\nBut some banks worry the technology could become too expensive, especially if speculative flows are removed or the cost of regulation is factored in.\n\nRichard Brown, executive architect for banking industry innovation at IBM, says: \xe2\x80\x9cThere are lots of claims made for this technology, many of which don\xe2\x80\x99t stand up to scrutiny.\xe2\x80\x9d': 6, "FT knows who butters their bread and it's not the blockchain.": 2, "They're _barely_ conceding the point that the watering down of bitcoin value by mining seignorage, creates new coins, which at market value, for the number of transactions included in a block, makes it like there's a 'virtual' cost per transaction.\n\nBut of course what these munchkins fail to realize, is that bitcoin holders know that, and hold bitcoin anyway. It's already factored into their demand.\n\nWhat they can't quite realize is that getting in and out of bitcoin to and from fiat, if you do it right, can be less than 1%, and the transaction in bitcoin is nearly nothing.\n\nIf you wanted to, if it's rational for you to, you could choose to mine bitcoin. Or don't, no one is making you.\n\nIf you wanted to, if it's something you want to speculate on, you could choose to hold bitcoin.

Ethereum (still not released yet) is trying to build a tree chain which allows people to basically run decentralized applications. So like, with bitcoin the miners process transactions. In Ethereum what they're aiming for is a situation where you could pay to have the miners execute any program coded into ethereum.\n\nOne advantage to having all of this variety is that each of these currencies are a bit like an experiment.
