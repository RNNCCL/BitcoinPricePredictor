": 18, 'lol Windows XP.': 21, "I switched to GNU/Linux 5 years ago; nevertheless, I'm going to defend WinXP here.\n\nYou assume that OS security is the duty of the OS vendor. This is reasonable, as user doesn't have to know anything about security. And so running an OS which doesn't receive security updates anymore is, indeed, risky...\n\nHowever, an OS which regularly receives security updates is not necessarily secure. And hence security depends on user's behavior to a large degree.\n\nWInXP had so many bugs and fundamental security flaws that its users had no choice but to learn about how it works under the hood in more details and secure it themselves.\n\nThe general idea is that if you disable a certain OS component (which you don't use), then you don't really care if it is patched or not.  In other words, you can try to eliminate possible attack vectors instead of eliminating software vulnerabilities.\n\nAnd this is actually quite feasible.\n\nWindows XP received hundreds (or even thousands) of security updates, but almost all of them fix attack surfaces which can be actually disabled or eliminated:\n\n1. Networking.\n2. Standard (pre-installed) software.\n3. Windows Explorer.\n4. Autorun.\n5. Software already running on the system.\n\n3-5 can be addressed in a trivial way: if you do not use removable media, do no download and install any new software, it cannot bite you. 2 is trivial as well: if you don't use software which comes with Windows, it is dormant and cannot bite you either.\n\nAnd a trivial solution to 1 is to not use any networking, but that's not fun.\n\nNetworking, in general, has enormous attack surface. But it is very easy to eliminate it: disable all Windows-specific services.\n\nTCP/IP implementation by itself is OK, it is fairly compact so it wasn't that hard to secure it.\n\nHowever, Windows also runs a number of services and protocols, e.g. for discovering computers on LAN, browse their files, offer your own files for browsing and so on. And all of this is implemented in a very complex way, and is thus full of vulnerabilities.\n\nSo the thing is, if you only care about browsing the internets, you can disable all this shit altogether. All you need for browsing is outgoing TCP/IP connections.\n\nSo anyway, if we're betting on fully patched Windows 8 in default configuration vs. _properly secured_ WinXP, I would bet on WinXP any day (until a critical TCP/IP vulnerability is discovered).": 3, 'Pictures of Putin on a bear.': 3, 'AKA an escrow.': 1, '"Suspicious transaction"\n\nHmm...': 7, 'One has to maintain standards :)': 9}, ('How can I double bip38 something?', 1): {"Yeah don't do that.

The reason it takes 2-3 business days is the "unautomated clearing house" still exists to handle paper checks, and they are still on a daily clearing cycle.\n\nClearing is how banks settle with each other for the payments due between them.  A paper check is an "order" to pay money, it is not actual money changing hands.  The actual transfer of funds happens at the clearing houses, most of which are Federal Reserve District banks.\n\nBanks total up all the incoming and outgoing payments for the day, and calculate a net amount going in or out.  The clearinghouse opens a special account for the day, and the banks sending more outgoing, send their net to that special account (using wire transfer or other secure system).  The clearing house then wires all the banks who are owed incoming amounts out of that account.  Theoretically this "clears" the account - it ends up with zero balance.  In practice there are some glitches to iron out manually.  Once the account is zeroed, it gets closed.  Then they open a new account the next day.\n\nThe reason banks do it this way, is otherwise every bank would have to pay every other bank directly, for 9000 transfers per bank.  With a clearing house, each bank only does one outgoing or incoming transaction a day.\n\nOnce everything is electronic, they could speed up the clearing cycle to hourly or faster, or eliminate it entirely (9000 direct transactions is not too much for computers to handle).': 1, 'Celery, very slow though': 1, 'Try it again.

To me, bitcoin was clearly intended as a technical experiment to test whether (block reward)+(proof of work)+(longest-chain-wins) would motivate people to mine and protect the public ledger.

Either the value of each coin needs to go up, a lot, or the fee per transaction will need to jump to a non-negligible level...\n\nCompare that to a system with stable block awards - we\'d never have to worry about miners lacking incentive to mine.

Furthermore, your statement of:\n\n> "...especially since he settled on it before having any experience with Bitcoin on a live network..."\n\ndoes little to validate your claims, for two specific reasons.\n\nFirstly, having settled on a block finding time prior to live network analysis, does not suggest the 10-minute time parameter was arbitrary.  Many of us make non-arbitrary decisions frequently, before testing.  We\'re able to do so from the body of experience we bring to the task, in addition to estimates performed in advance.\n\nSecondly, you don\'t know that Satoshi "settled on it" before the network went live.  He could have easily coded it for 10-minute blocks, then brought the network live, to see how well it functioned.  Who\'s to say he didn\'t monitor the performance of the live network\'s 10-minute finding time, only to "settle on it" afterwards?  There\'s no evidence that any of this was arbitrary.

Another way is to build a network on top specifically designed with scalability in mind. That\'s what Lightning Network is about.\n\nThe proposal extends the hub-and-spoke micropayment channel system described here:\n\nhttps://www.mail-archive.com/bitcoin-development@lists.sourceforge.net/msg06576.html\n\nUnder hub-and-spoke, the hub can steal the payment. However, the damage is limited if you\'re only sending a micropayment through the channel. If the hub refuses to forward the payment, you just disconnect and find a more trustworthy hub.\n\nBut hub-and-spoke can be used to solve a slightly different problem - keeping transactions off the block chain, yet securing them cryptographically and with enforceable contracts, and ultimately settling them on the block chain. The example of an exchange comes to mind.\n\nWith larger payments flowing through the channel, you need to trust the hub not to steal them. The Lightning Network solves this problem by making it impossible for the hub to spend the payment. The payer and intended payee negotiate an offset to the hub\'s key pair before making the payment. Only the intended payee can unlock the funds.\n\nThis is somewhat analogous to the way stealth payments work. Payer and payee negotiate an offset to a key pair. The payer pays to the offset public key, but can\'t unlock the payment. Only the payee can do that.\n\nTo get this to work, we need to fix malleability.

There is a reason why Developers should *not* be in control of product development priorities, naming, feature lists, or planning for a product. That is the job of the sales, marketing, and product development teams who actually *interface with the customer*. They are the ones who do the research and know what\'s needed for a product. They are the ones who are supposed to decide what things are called, what features come next, and how quickly shit gets out the door.\n\nBitcoin has none of that. You\'ve got a Financial product, being created for a financial market, by a bunch of developers with *no* experience in finance, and (more importantly) absolutely *no way* for the market to have any input or control over what gets done, or what it\'s called.  That is crazy to me. \n\nLuke is a perfect example of why you don\'t give developers control over *anything* other than the structure of the code. \n\nThey are not supposed to be making product development decisions. They are not supposed to be naming anything. And they definitely are not supposed to be deciding "what comes next" or how quickly things get done.
