I think the calls you want are getblock which will list all the transaction in a block, and then gettransaction which gives you the tx info.  You have to turn on the -txindex option though for the gettransaction calls to work.\n\nIt will be *very* slow to pull out all transactions though.  If you want to do it faster, you might need to find some code for parsing of the raw blockchain.\n\nBTW, your single line format doesn't seem to cover the structure of transactions.

We have always accepted these requests and it has been our pride and joy to witness the rising number of groups calling themselves the Bitcoin Embassy.\n\nIt has recently come to our attention that a group using the website bitcoinembassy.io claims to own the trademark to the Bitcoin Embassy name and logo, as reported today by Coindesk.

You do not need anybody\xe2\x80\x99s permission to start your own Bitcoin Embassy, certainly not from bitcoinembassy.io which, in any case, does not appear to be a real legal or formal entity.\n\nWe consider any attempt to trademark the Bitcoin Embassy name or logo a violation of the Bitcoin community spirit.\nWe have no issue whatsoever with having a website being a registry of institutions called Bitcoin Embassy, but we do have issue when the operators of such websites insinuating to have a monopoly over the brand that we have worked so hard to build.\n\nWe hope this is only a misunderstanding but we would like to clarify once and for all that\n-any group can call themselves a Bitcoin Embassy\n-there is no official Bitcoin Embassy network whose membership requires endorsement\n-there is no trademark over the Bitcoin Embassy name and logo, namely the \xe2\x80\x9cB\xe2\x80\x9d surrounded by laurel leaves, which we created in 2013 and which we did not trademark\n\nFor any questions or details, you can contact me at francis@bitcoinembassy.ca\nFrancis Pouliot,\nDirector of Public Affairs at the Bitcoin Embassy': 3}, ('Do you think you were scammed by GAW?

The increased currency risk could lead to the network being used for transmission, but everyone trying to hold bitcoins as short as possible, driving the currency into the ground.\n* While it is hard to effectively forbid use of Bitcoin, it is comparably easy to forbid shops from accepting it. Such regulation could drive Bitcoin into blackmarkets, making them much less attractive for most organizations and individuals.\n* Overt miner centralization could give a minority of the mining power the ability to block further development of the Bitcoin protocol, or in turn, a mining majority the power to dictate protocol changes.\n* Just because it is better in many aspects than other payment networks, doesn't mean that it will ever breach the mainstream.

If you use a payment processor such as BitPay, they check with multiple nodes, whether the transaction was received as well.

An unlimited number of blockchains can be started. If they all had an equal market share then the market share per chain would go to 0.\n\nBut Bitcoin isn\'t just the blockchain technology, it\'s also the network. Bitcoin has a much bigger network effect than any of the other blockchain based currencies. It has better development, stronger security, more liquidity, more infrastructure, more investment and more mindshare than all the other cryptocurrencies combined.\n\nThe difference that Bitcoin\'s network makes is evidenced by the fact that it has a market cap 59 times larger than the next blockchain based runner up, Litecoin.\n\nAs long as Bitcoin maintains a strong network effect, and until an altcoin comes along with a killer feature that Bitcoin can\'t coopt, Bitcoin will maintain the lion\'s share of cryptocurrency value.\n\n> And this is not just theoretical (though there is considerable theory behind that assertion).

No risk in that.": 3, "> Unfortunately, this is not how valuation processes work.\n\nHow do they work?\n\nIf bitcoin has any usefulness then there will be people willing to buy bitcoin so they can use it. However much those people value the use they get out of it divided by the number of units in circulation determines the fundamental value.\n\nExample: In 2013 there were [$26.7 billion in remittances to the Philippines](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remittance#Top_recipient_countries). Let's say, for the sake of an example, that bitcoin captures 0.1% of that. That's $26.7 million/per year. Let's also say that one round trip takes three hours: three transactions (from an exchange to a sender, from the sender to the receiver, from the receiver to an exchange where it is immediately sold to the next sender) at six confirmations each. At this fastest ideal all bitcoins would make 2922 trips per year (365.25 day in a year * 24 hours in a day / 3 hours per trip). At a maximum of 21 million bitcoins in existence that would be a volume 61.362 billion BTC transferred to the Philippines per year. ($26.7 million/per year)/(61.362 billion BTC/year) = $0.000435/BTC (low *but not zero*)\n\nThese numbers, of course, are not reality. Bitcoin may capture more or less than that, this is only one market, and the velocity will be much lower than that. Whatever the exact numbers are, though, as long as there are some people using it, there will be a non-zero floor.\n\n> As for remittance in particular, it's been shown that the actual costs of remittance when you do not hold on to the coins is still more expensive due to exchange fees on either end.\n\nSource?\n\nBitcoins can be bought from Coinbase for a 1% fee and sent to the Philippines and converted to Philippine pesos for free using rebit.ph . 1% total fees looks pretty competitive for remittances.\n\n> Some companies are burning through VC to hide exchange fees in their services, but that is not sustainable or actual value for the technology.\n\nTaken on its own burning money like that is not sustainable.

The exchange can be hacked and your funds lost or stolen, also the custodian could become insolvent with the dropping BTC price and decide to stop redeeming NuBits. Recently the NuBits peg was reported broken on CCEDK due to some error, possibly with the custodian's liquidity bot.

So it is likely the absolute value will continue to decrease except when new audiences are found, where tinier and tinier bubbles form.

Plus, rebit does indeed have fees for the bank transfer or pick up location that is significant (you only have no fees if you want to drive all the way across the country to get to their main office, where they offer a free pickup).  Additionally, the main office pick ups are still a part of the VC funding eating, as is the general no fees marketing of late - it's advertising money, basically.  They regularly work at 1-2% fees.\n\nThe reason that remittance must be more expensive with Bitcoin is because you have added layers over a common core cost.  You are still moving physical legal tender on both sides.  These are bank transfers and an exchange fee.  With Bitcoin, though, you have two exchange fees (one on each side) along with the bank transfers on each side.  Exchange fees are exchange fees - they are the cost of currency store and handling the transfers.  There is no way you can get cheaper with the same overhead plus more.  Plus there is of course the Bitcoin transaction cost (very small of now, but affect on inflation).\n\nThe reason people thought remittance might be useful was because of the low transaction cost in current Bitcoin.  But that is only if the Bitcoins are held onto on both sides.  That doesn't help pay for goods in 3rd world countries, it is volatile and sinking (because pure speculative value is unstable and has equilibrium approaching 0), and does not solve any issue that one would remit money for.\n": 1, 'You could try bitreserve.org which allows you to swap BTC for GOLD, EUR, USD...

Those are all possible in trusted networks, and typically are far easier and more secure.  You do not need the untrusted computing network for transaction security or escrow, which has existed for years, and cryptographic algorithms for signing PoE existing in many forms (the service linked, in fact, makes no essential use of blockchain technology).\n\nAs for remittance in particular, it's been shown that the actual costs of remittance when you do not hold on to the coins is still more expensive due to exchange fees on either end.  If you do hold Bitcoin as your value store, then you must deal with the volatility and decay-to-zero and over long periods will have remitted little (effective fees grow approaching full transact).

But if, due to anonymity, I can't determine the customer's location, then I have know way of knowing whether to apply the rules at all.\n\nAnd that's the fundamental problem with making the /seller/ completely liable on a transaction whose intent, initiation and mechanism may be largely controlled by the buyer.
