People take the train to get from point A to point B (bitcoin transactions send money from person A to person B). \n\nIf less than 100 people arrive at the train station every 15 minutes the train carts can easily carry all those people to their desired location. But the moment more than 100 people arrive before the 15 minute departure time not everyone is going to be able to get on the train cart to get to where they want, they will have to wait for the second train to pass by. If thousands of people are arriving at the train then some people might have to wait for 10 train carts (150 minutes) to arrive before they get a chance to board the train. \n\nAs bitcoin becomes more popular and more people are sending more and more transactions per second 1MB blocks aren't big enough to fit all those transactions on the blocks that are solved an avg of every 10 minutes. Hence some people will have long wait times to get their bitcoin from point A to point B. increasing the blocks from 1MB to 20MB would be like expanding the train carts from allowing 100 people to 2000 people.

If someone else has lengthened the chain but you aren't aware of it, you are wasting effort.

Sure, blocks would take 40 minutes each at first but eventually (~two months after the hardfork) difficulty would adjust and v.old blocks would continue to be mined at the rate of one every 10 minutes.\n\nSo if mining v.old were to continue, and a market exists for those newly mined coins -- anyone with bitcoins that existed prior to the fork would be wise to capture the spending power of them on both v.old as well as v.new.

We don\'t make any effort to stem the flow of transactions. What happens when there are more transactions than a particular user\'s network can handle? Do we start limiting the throughput of the network just because a few people out there can\'t handle more than 5 or 6 transactions a second? Do video game producers limit the size of their games so that they\'ll run on a 486? No, of course not. We are honest about what it takes or MIGHT take to run a particular application, and put the onus on the user to ensure he can handle it. In the case of Bitcoin, we just start telling people, "Look, if you want to run a full node great, but you may occasionally see really big spikes in bandwidth and have to download a really big block. Because of economic forces, it\'s unlikely to happen very often, but it might. It\'s a system that is always on, always growing, and we do not place artificial restrictions on that growth. If you don\'t think you can handle this, don\'t run a full node. There\'s always SPV clients out there for those users who can\'t handle a full node."\n\n> With an explicit max block size, programmers can use simpler, more efficient, and more reliable data structures (e.g. static monolihic buffers, instead of dynamically allocated and segmented ones). \n\nSo we really want a system that\'s tailored to lazy developers? It\'s entirely possible to handle unpredictable datasets safely. Database designers do it all the time. The blockchain is just another kind of database.\n\n> They can also tell users how much memory they need to have in order to run the software, and guarantee that it will not run out of memory in that case.\n\nSee my first point about this..  Just tell them to expect the unexpected, and write the software to handle these situations cleanly.\n\n> A static max block size is also a security measure. Suppose that 10% of the nodes are known to be running on computers that have only 8 GB of memory and no swap memory. Then a malicious miner with (say) 1% of the total hashpower could try to mine blocks with 9 GB of bogus transactions. After about 100 trials he will succeed. Then those 10% of the nodes will crash, while the other 90% will acept the 9GB block as valid. From then on, those 10% will be permanently unable to process the blockchain, unless their memory is physically expanded.\n\nIf the software is written to handle large blocks cleanly despite resource limitations, this issue goes away. There\'s no hard and fast rule that says the block has to be stored entirely in RAM as it\'s downloaded and verified. The software can be written to do some swapping. And you can make the same argument about hitting the limit of some poor user\'s disk drive. If a user wants to run a full node, he must have the ability to expand his capacity to handle it as needed.\n\nAlso, in order for a rogue miner to be able to choke the network, he not only has to FIND a block, he must propagate it before it can be orphaned. If relays set limits on the sizes of blocks they are willing to propagate, a rogue miner might not be able to get his block out there in time to do any damage.\n\nAll of your arguments in favor of a hard limit on the block size seem to be addressable through other means.

In fact, they are incentivized to keep blocks as small as possible so that they can upload them as fast as possible and as many relays as possible can propagate them. \n\nThe "incentives" argument only works when applied to miners as a whole.  One specific miner may have external incentives to sabotage the network.  For most kinds of attacks, the incentives will result in *a majority of other miners* deflecting the attack.  But in the "oversize block" attack, the block size will be such that the majority of the miners can handle and accept it, but smaller nodes and clients will not.\n\nI do not know whether such an attack could disable a miner -- specifically,  the master computer of a mining farm or pool, which assembles blocks to be mined.  (I believe some miners use a Raspberry Pi for this purpose.) I suspect that this task does not require it to download full blocks created by others.  But, if they do have to download other blocks, then a rogue miner would have an incentive to mine an oversize block: it will knock out some competitors. \n\n> They have the tools to do this now, with a configurable size limit that\'s kept intentionally low by default. As we saw with the recent stress test, most of them are actually using the configurable limit rather than the max limit.\n\nThat is the mex size of blocks that the miner will try to mine, and it must be less than the hard limit of 1 MB.  In the current protocol, any block larger than 1 MB is invalid by definition, and will be rejected by all players who respect the protocol.\n\n> Relays can be given a similar tool (if they don\'t already have it) to stop or at least slow down the spread of megablocks. They don\'t HAVE to relay a block they think is too big.\n\nBut what is "too big"?  If each node has its own definition of "too big", it is still possible that the majority of the miners will accept and include in the blockchain a node that is too big for some nodes to handle.  Those nodes then will be permanently unable to process the blockchain.\n\nEven if all nodes think that a block is "not too big", the block may be too big for clients who need to read the blockchain in order to sync their wallets. \n\n> You\'re comparing apples to oranges. There is a maximum packet size yes, but that does not limit the amount of DATA that can be exchange. \n\nA 1 MB block size limit does not limit the number of outputs of a payment; clients only need to break the list of recipients in to several chained transactions each fitting in one 1 MB block (or 750 kB, to be considered by most miners),\n\nA 1 MB block only limits the number of trasnctions per second because all transactions are serialized through one logical "gate" (the blockchain) and the block rate is intentionally limited to 1 block every 10 minutes.  Making block size unlimited in order to get around these design limitations is a hack that will create more problems than it solves.  Instead one should be working to increase the mean block rate, and reorganize the blockchain so that each player only needs to dowload a small part of it.': 1, '> Are you a programmer? Or just an "ideas guy"? ;-)\n\nI\'m not a programmer on the scale of Gavin or others, mostly because I discovered while studying computer science in college that I hate debugging code, but I do some software development, and I have been on the operations side of software development houses, learning and witnessing what is possible and how to tackle these types of issues for over 20 years.\n\n> No computer can process unlimited blocks.\n\nNo, they will hit hardware limits eventually. But a computer PROGRAM can process unlimited blocks if it treats those blocks as a data stream, or uses swapping techniques to load only the portion of the block it is examining into RAM while the rest sits on the disk. I don\'t claim that it\'s easy, just that it\'s possible.\n\nBut that\'s not really the issue you\'re concerned with. The issue that bothers you is that miners might be able to produce a block that\'s too large for small users to handle it. \n\nThat\'s certainly a technical risk, but they are not incentivized to do so. In fact, they are incentivized to keep blocks as small as possible so that they can upload them as fast as possible and as many relays as possible can propagate them. \n\nThey have the tools to do this now, with a configurable size limit that\'s kept intentionally low by default. As we saw with the recent stress test, most of them are actually using the configurable limit rather than the max limit.\n\nRelays can be given a similar tool (if they don\'t already have it) to stop or at least slow down the spread of megablocks. They don\'t HAVE to relay a block they think is too big.\n\nIf we make it intentionally hard to get a large block propagated, and set reasonable defaults on the configurable limits, then we can allow large blocks, because we can be relatively well assured that miners won\'t produce blocks that are TOO large.\n\nAnd as the size of the network grows, and hardware technology advances, we can adjust those defaults upward without a hard fork.\n\nEdit: I should also point out that 1MB blocks are already too big for some computers. You couldn\'t run Bitcoin Core on a Commodore 64 or an Apple II+ with a 2400bps modem. So where do we draw the line? And just because most computers today can handle 1MB blocks, do we cripple the software to 1MB (or 20MB) just because that\'s ALL computers today can handle? We\'re building a protocol that\'s supposed to scale as hardware limits expand. But we\'re putting in a soft limit to prevent exactly that! And even the 40%/yr approach requires us to guess now at how fast hardware will be in the future. What happens if we get some quantum leap in hardware capabilities 5 years down the road that lets of break out of Moore\'s Law and we get a 5000% capacity boost? Do we have to hard fork again to adjust and keep up with the new baseline? Wouldn\'t it be preferable to just adjust some config settings?\n\nEdit: \n> That is the same reason why the internet has a maximum packet size valid for everybody. As soon as two or more computers need to communicate or share a common database, it is necessary to specify a common maximum size for the messages and entries.\n\nYou\'re comparing apples to oranges. There is a maximum packet size yes, but that does not limit the amount of DATA that can be exchange. It simply establishes a method for breaking up large data sets into smaller pieces so they can be handled. You\'re really illustrating my point that computers can handle unlimited data sets if care is taken to do it right.\n\n> How will a guy know whether his computer is good enough to run as a node?\n\nA C64 or Apple II+ with a 2400bps dialup connection probably could have handled the first couple blocks (I don\'t know, maybe I\'m exaggerating a bit). A 386 could have handled blocks for awhile as well. At some point, some computers will stop being able to handle the block chain. We can say for certain what is required to reach the current block. And going forward, even if we remove the hard limit, we can still say within a margin of error what will be required. If a really big block makes it into the chain and doesn\'t get orphaned, well, then that\'s the new minimum limit.  But I think that if we allow relays to limit propagation, we can stop that from happening without requiring a hard limit on the size of blocks.': 1, "> I personally would much prefer to see hardware limits act as the bottleneck than to introduce an artificial bottleneck into the protocol that has to be adjusted regularly.\n\nThe software and protocol are TECHNICALLY capable of scaling to handle the world's entire transaction set.

The rationale you gave - the supply of euros falling - is the monetarist, Friedman explanation for inflation and deflation. There are other reasons for those monetary phenomena to take place. In Europe, deflation is being caused by an economic contraction coupled with investor uncertainty which suppresses investment and spending. In other words, the euros which are being printed are largely being hoarded, so the supply of euros is being outstripped by the demand for them.\n\nWhat matters for inflation and deflation is the delta between demand for a currency and the supply of it, not absolute amounts of currency being printed.

Why exactly do some people say it needs to be increased and what are the drawbacks ?": 4, "The maximum block size (it's a maximum, blocks may be smaller) puts a limit on the amount of transactions that can be included in a block. Since blocks are added every 10 minutes on average, this determines the maximum transaction rate of the network.\n\nIncreasing the maximum block size would allow for larger blocks and more transactions to be included, which is important if Bitcoin is to gain more widespread adoption.\n\nOpponents of the idea of increasing the maximum block size state that with an increased maximum block size, the requirements on bandwidth and storage space for running a node will increase, which will make it more difficult for individuals to run a full node and which might harm the decentralized nature of the network.\n\nHowever, increasing the maximum block size doesn't immediately increase the the actual size of the blocks. Most blocks don't reach the 1 MB limit today, they won't suddenly be much larger if the limit is 20 MB instead of 1 MB. The average size of blocks should increase gradually as Bitcoin becomes more widely used. But with storage space of harddisks still growing steadily, it is expected that even with increased block sizes, it will remain affordable to operate a Bitcoin node.\n\nAlternatives to raising the block size limit that are being mentioned regularly are so-called offchain solutions, where a large part of the transactions are processed internally by a single party and the blockchain itself is primarily used for bulk settlements. However, this setup also threatens the decentralized nature as the parties that broker the offchain transactions have control over who gets to do what, just like banks do now.\n\nAnother proposed solution is the concept of sidechains. With sidechains, there exist several coexisting blockchains with different rules and properties that are linked to the Bitcoin blockchain and where one can exchange coins on a sidechain for bitcoins and vice versa. This however doesn't really reduce the storage space requirement, it only moves some of the load from the main Bitcoin blockchain to the sidechains, but these need to be stored regardless (and ideally by as many people as possible to ensure the system remains decentralized). An added bit of controversy is that some of the Bitcoin Core developers are employed by Blockstream, the company behind the concept of sidechains.\n\nFinally, there are those that agree with the need to increase the maximum block size, but have different ideas as to what it should be increased to and if there should be automatic periodic increases (for example +10% every year) or not.": 3, "Sidechains aren't a scaling mechanism.": 1, "Pro-raise: More transactions per second possinble.  \n\nAnti-raise: Increased resources required to run full nodes(that enforce consensus) and mining can be more vulnerable to centralization/censor pressure.  \n\nTons more e-ink can be spilled on it, but that's the basic fundamental tension.": 1, 'Thanks.

It needs a hard fork and that is inherently a bit risky.  For myself, I think that if we are going to need hard forks at some point, it might be best to go through that now.  But I change my mind all the time - is it better to get bitcoin settled first, so there are wider interests invested in ensuring it works?\n\n2.  More deeply, I think the objections of the core devs are that there is a fundamental problem of correctly incentivising transactions.  At the moment the fees are far lower than the true costs -  not just of making the transaction, but of preserving it for the future so the outputs can be used (spent).  Holders of bitcoin massively subsidise the network, as the value of their bitcoins is diluted each time a miner gets a block reward.  Lots of people think a large proportion of transactions are spam that is enabled by this situation.  From this perspective, raising the block size allows this inefficient practice to continue.  People who take this position think the blockchain itself shouldn't be used for all the transactions everyone wants to make - but that it should be the authoritative settlement ledger, with the bulk of transactions occuring in off-chain systems, such as Lightning, which are much more efficient and better suited to large volumes.  Leaving the blocksize at 1Mb will focus everyone on developing those solutions - which are arguably essential for the future of bitcoin.  For myself I agree this has to be the way things go - but I'm unsure of whether the timing is right to force the issue now.  After all everyone is accepting that transactions are subsidised by mining just now - and I don't see that becoming a really serious problem in the near future.": 1, 'For $120 it better be the best-damned security in the world, considering I can walk to any bank and open a free checking and savings account which I never have to worry about, ever.': -1, "Nodes verify and relay.

I don't know who he thinks he is, or what has gotten into him. I've been finally browsing other posts in the Mailing List too, and Gavin's attitude has been more and more prevalent. He sounds like a bully, and as if he thinks he is CEO rather than an equal member.\n\nFYI, here's something that's really worth examining, in case you missed it. Adam Back of Blockstream posted his thoughts here:\n\n* https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/37vg8y/is_the_blockstream_company_the_reason_why_4_core/crqdnoo\n\nMore specifically, he linked to what looks like a very creative 'compromise' solution:\n\n* https://www.mail-archive.com/bitcoin-development@lists.sourceforge.net/msg07937.html\n\nI was considering making a thread out of this, but I don't know how to title it and describe it. Also, if you scroll down to the bottom and look at the 3 responses, Gavin did respond and his response was utterly arrogant and passive-aggresive and implicitly dismissive of the opinion of Adam Back and co. (as eloquently expressed in the former link I posted above) that decentralization and cheap-to-run nodes is core to Bitcoin's ethos and cypherpunk philosophy (which is espoused by Blockstream).\n\nThoughts?\n\n*edit:*\n\n/u/finway brought 2 links to my attention, posts by Mike Hearn in response to Adam Back's idea. It helps provide more perspective and is quite valuable in understanding the situation better.": -2, "> And with 2400 tps what is that going to do to the size growth of the blockchain? \n\nHaving the full block chain available is a rather dangerous addiction. Satoshi talked about pruning in the very initial paper about Bitcoin - before even the code was written.\n\nBitcoin can be pruned now, and it needs to change eventually to have UTXO commitments or ZK-proofs of wellformed-ness (though these are right now moon math) or similar so that you can run a node it in eventually (almost) constant amount of space.\n\nOr maybe not, because disk space gets so cheap it doesn't matter. \n\nBut if it matters, please do not cripple Bitcoin the transaction network because you are all clinging to 'I have all transactions available'.\n\nLike with 1MB, people got used to 'we all need all transactions all the time'. If people are going to become stuck on those issues, Bitcoin *will* die.": 1, 'Eight. 8MB, do I hear four?\n\nEdit: That all of the sudden you guys are happy with 8, should make you think about what is the right number and why? _____ likes it is not a good reason.': -1, "The original whitepaper, *of course*.\n\nThere's even a web conversion of it now:\nhttp://nakamotoinstitute.org/bitcoin/\n\nThe code to prune is a lot more recent and by Peter Wuille, I think.": 2, 'its not planned economics.

The upgrade could increase the base size to buy us the time. Miners would contribute 1 satoshi to their 'right size' with each transaction.
