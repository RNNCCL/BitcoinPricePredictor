Something like flexcap is probably a good idea in the long-run, though I'm not sure that the current proposals guarantee Bitcoin's long-term security. Probably this requires a lot more research. The hardfork proposal that BlueMatt et al. will present later this year as a result of their Hong Kong agreement might be uncontroversial enough to get sufficient agreement.\n\nIn any case, almost all hardforks *can* be done as softforks instead. SegWit is one example of increasing capacity without a hardfork, and in a very non-disruptive way. A hardfork would in many cases be cleaner, but if it ends up being the case that sufficient consensus is basically impossible to achieve in most cases, the prospect of relying entirely on softforks doesn't worry me at all. Possibly, hardfork-type changes in Bitcoin will almost always be done first as a softfork, and then the softfork will be made simpler and more efficient in an uncontroversial hardfork later.

But it\xe2\x80\x99s a hard message to communicate to an industry by and large blinded by love for the notion that a riskless system is just around the corner. Blockchain has become a siren song.\n\n> Luckily, there are some who seem immune to the enchantment and offering a more realistic take on the potential of the technology.\n\n> One such fellow is Larry Tabb, with 20 years of experience building financial markets clearing, settlement, cash management and accounting software. Tabb recently put out a report identifying some of the core challenges facing the roll out of blockchain.\n\n> One of the core issues being:\n\n> Ownership and identification, and why real-time settlement poses major hurdles for a financial system that depends on anonymity and obscurity for liquidity and efficiency, but also a broker network which can identify parties on a need to know basis when necessary.\nAs Tabb states:\n\n> If we have a brokered market but have securities registered to their owners, then we either need back-to-back trades, and risk having brokers perceived as front-running, or move into an ID market, which impacts liquidity and hurts firms that would prefer to stage anonymous. And if we get rid of brokers, then it becomes virtually impossible to hide anything, unless we go to completely anonymous; while there may be brokers and clients listed on the blockchain, no one sees anything when using the public blockchain (which regulators surely won\xe2\x80\x99t like), and if we use a private blockchain, the owner of the private blockchain would be in complete control, as they would be the only one with any information.\n\n> Other issues then include:\n\n> Securities lending and information leakage \xe2\x80\x94 the inability of investors to sell securities quickly on news events even if they are lent out, because they have to be repatriated first (discouraging stock lending in the first place). And information leakage that they are planning to sell because securities are being recalled.\nForeign exchange \xe2\x80\x94 time-zone differences which impede real-time settlement in general.\nAllocations/confirmations/block process \xe2\x80\x94 you can\xe2\x80\x99t easily fragment large purchases for liquidity reasons if your name is attached to every trade, opening the door to information leakage. Then there\xe2\x80\x99s the issue of aggregating small trades into larger blocks, because an immutable, immediate ledger would prevent cost-averaging for group transactions.\n> Physicals \xe2\x80\x94 All physical certificates would have to be banned, especially if they still carried legal rights to ownership, because it would be impossible to physically keep up with the settlement process.\nNetting \xe2\x80\x93moving to blockchain would prevent netting and thus require the processing of up to 2.9m more settlement records a day. Not efficient. Especially if you require consensus for everyone of those trades.\nTechnology infrastructure \xe2\x80\x94 record keeping isn\xe2\x80\x99t everything and blockchain doesn\xe2\x80\x99t solve or improve on the ability to manage accounts, drive P&L, calculate risk etc.\nConclusion?\n\n> While bankers would love to eliminate settlement risk in the system, the idea of adding literally tens of millions of additional settlements would arguably bring us back to the paperwork crises of the mid 70s, which was the driving force to create clearing houses in the first place, says Tabb.': 1}, ('Mentor Monday, February 29, 2016: Ask all your bitcoin questions!', 10): {'Thanks!

He does this all of the time, and uses that slide as a justification for why the blocksize should actually be decreased!\n\nProbably the biggest thing I hope to accomplish is to show that opening and closing channels just once every six months, simply will not work.\n\nIf I had a sufficient background in mathematics, maybe I could prove it that way. \n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_flow\n\nBut, instead, I'm just going to simulate it.  It is my 'intuition' that if a massive number of people were trying to access the bitcoin blockchain just twice per year, the *average* mempool backlog would probably be measured in weeks.  And, of course, if transactions are backlogged by weeks, the entire concept of the LN simply doesn't even work.\n\nObviously the *real* solution to these problems is a combination of both on-chain scaling combined with off-chain scaling.\n\nHowever, how can we have a sensible conversation when core devs are claiming that none of this is even a problem!?\n\nIf, it turns out, that the realistic use case is for every person to have four channels open, and with them averaging opening and closing a channel say once every few weeks, then let's run those numbers.\n\nIf that is the realistic assumption, great, let's work with those numbers.  However, I have had extensive and exhausting conversations with core devs who swear that one channel every six months **IS** the realistic use-case.\n\nAt any rate, a simulation that actually attempts to shove as many people as possible onto the LN has real value.

The middle graph, labelled "Less Decentralized" is the same but with 2 edges added, eliminating the single point of failure.\n\nAny way I look at it, the middle graph is more decentralized.  Same vertices, two extra edges, no more single point of failure, sounds good to me.  It\'s not like you\'ve got one vertex with an outsize degree; there are lots of vertices with degree 5 on the top graph, all of which are unaffected by the addition of 2 edges.\n\nI\'d also argue that the bottom graph, labeled "centralized", is actually MORE decentralized than the one on top!  Sure, there\'s that vertex at the top with degree 13.  That\'s a lot, and maybe that gives a bad gut-feeling.  But as in the middle graph, it\'s a *superset* of the top, only adding edges and reducing points of failure.  \n\nPeople might argue "but there\'s this supernode / hub / evil central node in the middle!"  Which is true but all the other edges are still there.  If in the bottom graph many of the edges had been eliminated and the *only* path was through that top supernode, I\'d agree it was more centralized.\n\nThe larger problem is we don\'t seem to have agreement on what "decentralized" means in mathematical terms.  Everyone (or almost everyone) seems to agree that decentralization is good and centralization is bad, but without clear measurements of centralization people can get stuck in unproductive arguments despite wanting the same thing.\n\nNot that I\'m suggesting such a clear measurement or index.

It seems counter-intuitive that something where other people find out about my blocks slowly actually hurts others.  The amount of time to find a block is the same no matter what but propagation is slower.\n\nLet's say there is a world where 60% of the miners are very well connected to each other (maybe they are the same pool, and pretending to be several pools), and 40% are not.  But the 60%'s blocks take 2 minutes to send to the 40%.\n\nIn this case, when the big pool finds a block, the 40% is still working on the previous block.  The small pool finds a block that is very small and fast to propagate, and send it to the 60% during this 2 minute period.  But the 60% ignores it, since it already has a block of the same height, instead building on the block it already found.  So the 40%'s block gets orphaned.  On average, the big pool will find the next block, and then the small pool keeps building a chain that it knows about, until the small pool finally finds out that the big pool is ahead.\n\nThus, the small pool, even with fast propagation, loses.\n\n>As mining becomes less profitable, it seems that it would naturally become more centralized. Already, I can't mine on my CPU and so mining requires a great accumulation of resources...a 'centralization' of resources. \n\nYou are confusing specialization and investment with centralization.

Since the cost is approximately zero, miners acting individually and selfishly will choose to include as many transactions as they can.

(Actually, you can often guess these without downloading all of the data, but that's an optimization for later.) Once you know the transaction hash, you can check your mempool to see if you already have it. If you don't have it, you request it from one or two peers.\n\n> My hunch is that this would help initial sync (bitcoin currently has trouble with saturating your connection)\n\nNo, it won't help with initial sync, as that is limited by your CPU and disk accesses. Bitcoin will already download different blocks from different peers during initial sync, and there's no benefit from improving the granularity size with blocktorrent in that case.\n\n> 2) might help with the great firewall (but that's not a guarantee).\n\nIt's pretty much guaranteed. GFW-crossing performance is one of the main design goals of blocktorrent. UDP transmission is the main technology that provides for that, since the issue with the GFW is that the packet loss causes TCP's congestion window to shrink to nearly zero size.": 7, "Sounds pretty complicated, but if it works out better, great!

Saying that the relay network is decentralized is like saying a bitcoin network in which there were only one active miner is decentralized -- sure, it might be theoretically decentralizable, but in practice it is not.\n\nIn practice, due to the lack of self-organization, it takes a lot of work to set up and keep a relay network running, which is why there is only one.\n\n> Getting the lowest latency (thus most fair) block propagation while preserving bandwidth efficiency requires more than a smart protocol.

It's pretty simple to switch the UDP socket with a different transport socket later, or to encapsulate it in a socket that includes custom congestion control logic.\n\n> basically his answer was that proverb about hammers and nails\n\nA lot of the advantages and optimizations of blocktorrent come from using the merkle tree structure as the index of chunks instead of hashing every X bytes. This allows you to avoid downloading transactions that you already have in your mempool, and also gives a great way to make use of weak blocks by referring to a weak block's internal node (which would imply a 2^n sized set of transactions) plus some diff. It also makes it feasible to make almost every single UDP packet fully independent and verifiable, which makes packet loss almost irrelevant in terms of how much it delays the transfer.
