It's an extremely fair trade-off in terms of the raising of barriers to read access, for the increase in maximum tx throughout (20X increase from current limit, to a maximum capacity allowing economy 40X larger than current size, without reducing end-user write-access).": 1, '\xe0\xb2\xa0_\xe0\xb2\xa0': 3, 'Yes, but the video does present one solution. Others will also emerge (like Lightning), and be improved upon. Necessity is the mother of invention. The important thing is to keep the foundation/core solid and free from centralizing influences.': 1, 'there is a difference though, at least one i mean, which is that centralized miners are a bigger problem than some "federation" of servers .. but trustless servers, which can\'t steal your money and have to compete with one another.': 2, 'This feels like deja vu. Have we had almost this exact conversation before already? Lol.\n\nAnyway, I completely disagree with this characterization of "I think a basic consumer broadband subscription letting someone run a full node with 80 GB left over is pretty good." -- As I explained before to you, or someone else, that is not how the real world works. I, and *most* other rational economic actors, am not going to pay $100/month for my home internet connection with a 250 GB cap, and then host a node and lose 68% of the bandwidth paid for so that, in effect, I paid $100/month for only 80 GB of data. You can try to justify it here as being "pretty good" and an "extremely fair trade-off" but I absolutely don\'t see it that way; and, I\'m saying that being a total supporter of Bitcoin!\n\nSo, this is about making a choice.\n\n1) Aim for a lower max blocksize limit that is correspondent with the state of bandwidth today (and if scaling for the future, scale that limit according to the real growth in bandwidth) in order to maintain decentralization of nodes on the network. Or, 2) Forget about having an illusion of decentralized nodes and say upfront you are OK with a more centralized Bitcoin network with an order of magnitude fewer nodes.\n\nThis was the point illustrated by the video.\n\nOn the other hand, there is an argument that was made to me, something along the lines of this: if 1% of 500,000 users = 5,000 nodes, but Bitcoin scales 10x or 100x, then even 0.1% (order of magnitude smaller proportion of people hosting nodes) of 5,000,000 users = 5,000 nodes and 0.1% of 50,000,000 users = 50,000 nodes.\n\nSo: (much) larger blocks --> (much more) onerous bandwidth requirement --> more scale (more users supported) --> (paradoxically) more decentralization of nodes in the Bitcoin network\n\nI like this argument, and it does make sense. It feels a bit like the currently successful model of the few-in-number altruistic (or just rich? who knows) torrent seeders with high-powered internet connections, who submit most of the content and also seed that content to others.\n\nBut to be safe, the question to fully understand is what parameters will get us 10x or 100x more scale, and whether those parameters still keep node hosting decentralized enough to allow the 0.1% or higher proportion to be in effect.\n\nAlso, there is the consideration that it may not be a linear relationship that 0.1% of users will be hosting nodes. It\'s possible another \'drag\' (besides internet bandwidth requirement) on node hosts is that most new users will be \'pure consumers\', instead of the early adopters right now who are still quite interested in the technology and the underlying systems.\n\nEither way, this video illustrates the issue very, very well, and it\'s a pity it did not gain more upvotes so that it could help more people understand the issue and be more informed in the discussion.': 1, "That is suspiciously well-produced for a video created in 2013, long before the debate became intense.\n\nAnyway, the original purpose of the 1 MB limit was to prevent DOS attacks, and was intended to be raised as the total size of legitimate txs approached 1 MB per 10 minutes. If the 1 MBers want to turn Bitcoin into a lightweight network that only large banks can afford to write to, they need to get consensus from the community to change Bitcoin's vision.": 1, "> within data usage caps of many consumer grade broadband subscription offerings in the US\n\nActually, that's the problem; the data usage cap is not sitting there for sole use by a node. My cap with a 105/10 Mbps connection is 250 GB. No way will I run a node if it means having only 80 GB bandwidth/month left over for my internet activities.": 1, 'Decentralized and unusable to most of the world ': 2, 'FYI:\n\n* 1MB blocks require 8.5 GB bandwidth from a node in 1 month.\n* 20MB blocks require 170 GB bandwidth from a node in 1 month.': 0, 'I download more than that watching Spongebob.': 2, 'Thanks for the details.

If even in this category, a significant, albeit small, percentage of people would run a full node (the only cost is less data available for other application, which is a burden, but not THAT bad), there will a huge number of people with higher grade broadband subscriptions (data caps of 500+ GB / month) that will be able to run a full node relatively easily.\n\n>So: (much) larger blocks --> (much more) onerous bandwidth requirement --> more scale (more users supported) --> (paradoxically) more decentralization of nodes in the Bitcoin network\n\nYes exactly.\n\n> It feels a bit like the currently successful model of the few-in-number altruistic (or just rich? who knows) torrent seeders with high-powered internet connections, who submit most of the content and also seed that content to others.\n\nGood analogy.

Building on top of the Blockchain however is still too complex to understand and time consuming for the majority of developers. By releasing the Blockstrap application stack and API, we\'ve lowered that technical barrier and empowered the next generation of developers and startups to get creative and start experimenting on the Blockchain.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBlockstrap features a developer friendly API,  HTML5 Blockchain framework that supports Bitcoin, Litecoin and Dogecoin and their corresponding testnets. With several financial and non-financial application examples for use or inspiration.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Blockstrap stack uses an HTML5 framework to communicate with other APIs and comes with a jQuery plugin and full suite of JSON-driven, frontend HTML components. The package allows developers to conduct URL routing, browser-based data caching and dynamic templating for all six blockchains, while using only the core components for framework forms, with a deterministic HTML5 wallet. It also allows developers to create new web applications by extending the core through hooks and filters in much the same way that WordPress is used by current web developers."\n\nHope this explains better what the course is about !\n\nSame course in the cities London, Berlin, Prague, Barcelona go to: http://blockstrap.com/en/events/\n': 3, "After party eh :D, i'll surely think about it!": 2, 'In the bitcoin ecosphere we have various skills and levels of competence.

Miners have their own interests which are not completely aligned with those of the nodes and the users; we should not give this single group complete power.\n\nDepending on the demand curve for transactions, miners may want to reduce the limit so that tx fees will go higher, resulting in greater revenues.

Normally, it would be difficult for miners to be anti-competitive, because each individual miner acts according to his own interest rather than that of the group (tragedy of the commons).

Those miners in favor will switch over...\n\nYou can already  cast your vote by starting to run an XT node as many of us have.  Already there are over 130 XT nodes running.": 1, '> Once XT nodes are > 51% of all nodes running then the block size limit will automatically increase for the XT nodes. \n\nNodes running Bitcoin-XT are needed only to make sure the chain with the big blocks gets relayed.   It doesn\'t matter if only 20% of nodes are Bitcon-XT that\'s likely still  enough that blocks on the "big blocks" chain will propagate to other peers and eventually to miners. \n\nWhat matters is how much mining is on Bitcoin-XT.  But a simple 51% majority of mining shouldn\'t be enough.  There needs to be near universal acceptance.  Gavin had described an nVersion supermajority of 80% of the past N blocks (e.g., 1,000) reporting support for big blocks (i.e., mined by Bitcoin-XT) before the first big block will be accepted.\n\nThe thing is, even with 80% on Bitcoin-XT, that\'s probably not going to be enough to avoid the risk of "catastrophic consensus failure".': 1, '[deleted]': 2, 'aaaaand im getting downvted. \n': 2}}}
