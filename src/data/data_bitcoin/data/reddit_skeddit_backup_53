People all over the world (or in this case computer processing power) are attempting to win the Bitcoin Sudoku Block challenge faster than their peers.  Solving the puzzle fastest wins the block reward, which consists of freshly generated "coins" plus the transaction fees from network use.  The puzzle gets increasingly complex based on how quickly the puzzle was solved...think Sudoku with extra rows and columns.  The target length of time for solving those puzzles (blocks) is every ten minutes.  If the puzzle is solved faster, it adds columns and rows, if the puzzle takes longer than ten minutes, it subtracts them.\n\nEveryone has a shot at winning the puzzle fastest, which is the lottery aspect...even a minuscule amount of processing power could theoretically win, but as the complexity grows astronomically, it is less and less likely, which is why most miners nowadays "pool" their resources (processing power) together in an attempt to win the reward as a group, then split up the winnings based on how much each "worker" (computer) had contributed.  There are more and more instances though, of miners with insignificant computing power throwing caution to the wind and solo mining, attempting to win the entire reward of one block for themselves, even with the math overwhelmingly not in their favor, much like a traditional lottery.\n\nWhile the hardware has cycled from cpu to fpga to gpu, and finally now to ASIC\'s, what they all do is essentially try to solve the sudoku faster, the ASIC or Application Specific Integrated Circuit is now designed to do nothing but this specific computation, and they are now in the process of refining those chips often, squeezing out ever increasing "hashpower".  Hashing is essentially the math problem the computers do to solve the sudoku challenge.  The more hashpower, the higher your chances of solving the block.\n\nBitcoin is hard-coded with 21 million bitcoins available for mining at a very constant rate of every ten minutes, some of the coins are distributed.  Every four years the number of coins created in a block reward is cut in half.  We started at 50 coins per block and this year some time mid July we will experience our second halving, bringing us to 12.5 bitcoins per block, which effectively makes bitcoins 4X as hard to get, compared to their starting point where people could earn blocks with their laptop cpu...something miners consider a distant dream despite it only being 8 years ago that it all started on a dusty little crypto messaging board.\n\nAfter the initial distribution of 21 Million coins...the network will pay for itself with fees generated by the network being used rather than new coins, which is why the coins can currently be divided with by up to 8 decimal points (with the potential of adding more decimal points in the future as deemed necessary).  Thus fractions of bitcoins will be used, rather than whole bitcoins, because if the system survives until ~2140 when all the coins will be minted, the value of an individual bitcoin will be astronomically higher than it is today.': 2, 'thats pretty damn good. :)': 2}, ('BTC Exchange which works for New York customers?', 0): {'LibertyX ': 1, 'Gemini is licensed in the state of New York.\n\nhttps://gemini.com/.': 2, 'Thanks folks.

Then there's the technological problem - if someone comes up with a quantum computer (likely a state actor), they may suddenly have control of the network.

Why don\'t we have hyperinflation? \n\nBecause the velocity of money collapsed after the financial crisis.\nhttps://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/MZMV\n\n\nPre-2008, most economists trusted the old intuition that when central banks print tons of money, it devalues the money and you get inflation.  That\'s true...if the printing of "monetary base" translates into more "money" (M2).  But that requires that the velocity of money stay constant (or at least not collapse sharply).\n\nSo why did the velocity of money collapse?  Probably because it was artificially inflated by excessively optimistic consumers and banks.  Banks were making loans like crazy and consumers were borrowing like crazy (via home mortgages, credit card debt etc).  Because of the fractional reserve banking system, when banks make loans, it actually *creates* "money."  This is how "money" can rise faster than the "monetary base."\n\n\n': 1, 'http://bitfury.com/content/5-white-papers-research/pos-vs-pow-1.0.2.pdf\n\n\n >5 Conclusion\n\nCurrently, there are several digital currencies implementing some form of proof of stake consensus including  Peercoin, Nxt, Novacoin, BlackCoin and BitShares. However, **pure proof of stake approaches pose substantial  security threats** that cannot be recreated in proof of work systems (including Bitcoin). **These problems are  inherent to proof of stake algorithms, as proof of stake consensus is not anchored in the physical world** (cf. with  hashing equipment in proof of work).\n\nThat is why virtually all of currencies relying on proof of stake use additional mechanisms to address security  issues. For example, the initial distribution problem can be solved by using a timeconstrained version of proof of  work; double-spend attacks can be prevented by including information about recent blocks into transactions. Still,  these improvements can be seen as ad-hoc and incomplete. Unlike proof of work, proof of stake consensus  is not objective; the state of a PoS system cannot be reliably determined by new users based solely on protocol  rules and a list of blocks and other network messages obtained from peers. In order to prevent long range forks  of the blockchain, a proof of stake system needs to implement weak subjectivity by combining protocol rules  with  social-driven security. The social component of PoS systems weakens their decentralization and  mathematical soundness. As Vitalik Buterin puts it [20], \xe2\x80\x9c[A]ll \xe2\x80\x9cpure\xe2\x80\x9d proof-of-stake systems are ultimately  **permanent nobilities where the members of the genesis block allocation always have the ultimate say.** No matter  what happens ten million blocks down the road, the genesis block members can always come together and  launch an alternate fork with an alternate transaction history and have that fork take over.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n   A recent development in proof of stake are delegated systems. While these systems solve several major  problems with the straightforward PoS implementations, they are not yet widespread, making it difficult to  evaluate their security. Nevertheless, delegated PoS solves the \xe2\x80\x9cnothing at stake\xe2\x80\x9d problem and prevents short  range attacks on the system.': 5, "The issues you talk about are relative. The issue with fiat and fractional reserve banking is it require 2% exponential growth at any cost.

When economists discuss money, they talk about the "monetary base", which multiplied by the "velocity of money" yields what we think of as actual money: "M2."  By encouraging people to hold on to money (like by increasing real interest rates), the velocity of money falls and M2 decreases.

Call me pessimistic, but renting 51% (for a short period, at least) does not seem unthinkable to me. Stratum pooling is essentially this.

This is the genius point that made Bitcoin possible from bricks that are decades old tech. Pooled mining respects this only in the proper sense of pooled mining, which is what p2pool or GBT do. However, many so called "pools" are truly not: What *stratum* does is more like buying hashing power in exchange for a reward.\n\nWhen I say that "farm operators react" I mean that they can choose to mine at a pool or another or on their own. They do have to recoup the costs of their expensive miners, as well as future profit expectations, so they will react if they see that they are contributing to an attack, but it could take several confirmations for this.\n\nOne nice and reassuring empirical observation about Bitcoin is that the security (the target difficulty) appears to follow the price.

Ultimately, it wasn't the longest chain that won, but a rollback and and patch to the new Bitcoin code that maintained backward compatibility with the old chain.\n\nSo...

Since more than 51% of the hashing power is available for hire (this is what stratum pooling means) one could probably do a 3-confirmation attack for as little as 200 BTC or less, and maybe before farm operators are able to react against.\n\nAt longer timescales (e.g., 24h) we are probably safe, but only if we take into account the community reaction with the possibility of hard-forking back to safety.\n\nBut there is always a trade-off. Million dollar valued transactions could be safe with many confirmations, but billion dollar ones could still be at risk. The problem is that colored coins decouple their value from the underlying BTC value.

Gaining access to a fiat bank is relatively trivial.  A large percentage of the employees at any particular bank have access to every piece of information relevant to your account.  So what keeps them from stealing it?\n\nFiat bank money transfers are reversible.  If the transfer is a theft, the receiving bank will simply reverse the transaction after being informed.  Similarly, if you transfer money illegally from a fiat bank to paypal or coinabse or wherever, the bank will simply reverse the transaction.\n\nThis is what makes bitcoin so much less secure than fiat for most consumers.  If a thief steals your bank deposit, it might take a couple months, but 99% of the time you'll get your money back because the bank can simply reverse the transaction.  In contrast, once a thief steals your bitcoins, they're gone.\n\nSo what about your link?  The Russian hackers success wasn't that they stole the money, that's easy.

What comes next?](http://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21694528-era-predictable-improvement-computer-hardware-ending-what-comes-next-future)\n\n> But now, after five decades, the end of Moore\xe2\x80\x99s law is in sight (see [Technology Quarterly](http://www.economist.com/technology-quarterly/2016-03-12/after-moores-law)). Making transistors smaller no longer guarantees that they will be cheaper or faster. This does not mean progress in computing will suddenly stall, but the nature of that progress is changing. Chips will still get better, but at a slower pace (number-crunching power is now doubling only every 2.5 years, says Intel). And the future of computing will be defined by improvements in three other areas, beyond raw hardware performance.\n\n[After Moore\'s Law](http://www.economist.com/technology-quarterly/2016-03-12/after-moores-law)\n\n> \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a law about Moore\xe2\x80\x99s law,\xe2\x80\x9d jokes Peter Lee, a vice-president at Microsoft Research: \xe2\x80\x9cThe number of people predicting the death of Moore\xe2\x80\x99s law doubles every two years.\xe2\x80\x9d But now the computer industry is increasingly aware that the jig will soon be up. For some time, making transistors smaller has no longer been making them more energy-efficient; as a result, the operating speed of high-end chips has been on a plateau since the mid-2000s (see chart). And while the benefits of making things smaller have been decreasing, the costs have been rising. This is in large part because the components are approaching a fundamental limit of smallness: the atom.\n\n[Moore\'s Law Hits the Roof](http://www.agner.org/optimize/blog/read.php?i=417)\n\n> Through the last 40 years we have seen the speed of computers growing exponentially. Today\'s computers have a clock frequency a thousand times higher than the first personal computers in the early 1980\'s. The amount of RAM memory on a computer has increased by a factor ten thousand, and the hard disk capacity has increased more than a hundred thousand times. We have become so used to this continued growth that we almost consider it a law of nature, which we are calling Moore\'s law. But there are limits to growth, which Gordon Moore himself also points out. We are now approaching the physical limit where computing speed is limited by the size of an atom and the speed of light.\n>\n> Intel\'s iconic Tick-Tock clock has begun to skip a beat now and then. Every Tick is a shrinking of the transistor size, and every Tock is an improvement of the microarchitecture. The current processor generation called Skylake is a Tock with a 14 nanometer process. The next in sequence would logically be a Tick with a 10 nanometer process, but Intel is now putting "refresh cycles" after the tocks. The next processor, announced for 2016, will be a refresh of the Skylake, still with a 14 nanometer process. This slowdown of the Tick-Tock clock is a physical necessity, because we are approching the limit where a transistor is only a few atoms wide (a silicon atom is 0.2 nanometers).\n\n[The chips are down for Moore\xe2\x80\x99s law](http://www.nature.com/news/the-chips-are-down-for-moore-s-law-1.19338)\n\n> Next month, the worldwide semiconductor industry will formally acknowledge what has become increasingly obvious to everyone involved: Moore\'s law, the principle that has powered the information-technology revolution since the 1960s, is nearing its end.\n\n> That agenda, laid out in a report5 last September, sketches out the research challenges ahead. Energy efficiency is an urgent priority \xe2\x80\x94 especially for the embedded smart sensors that comprise the \'Internet of things\', which will need new technology to survive without batteries, using energy scavenged from ambient heat and vibration. Connectivity is equally key: billions of free-roaming devices trying to communicate with one another and the cloud will need huge amounts of bandwidth, which they can get if researchers can tap the once-unreachable terahertz band lying deep in the infrared spectrum. And security is crucial \xe2\x80\x94 the report calls for research into new ways to build in safeguards against cyberattack and data theft.\n\n> These priorities and others will give researchers plenty to work on in coming years. At least some industry insiders, including Shekhar Borkar, head of Intel\'s advanced microprocessor research, are optimists. Yes, he says, Moore\'s law is coming to an end in a literal sense, because the exponential growth in transistor count cannot continue. But from the consumer perspective, \xe2\x80\x9cMoore\'s law simply states that user value doubles every two years\xe2\x80\x9d. And in that form, the law will continue as long as the industry can keep stuffing its devices with new functionality.': 4, "Yes, miners do.
