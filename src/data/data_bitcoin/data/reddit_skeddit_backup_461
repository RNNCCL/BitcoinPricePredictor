The more zeros needed the more permutations it will statistically take to find a suitable hash.

However, anyone who simply wants to *check* the hash (proof of work) only needs to calculate one hash.\n\nI\'ve used sha1() because it\'s easier in this example.

A nonce of 19 got me 2 zeros, is that acceptable since it has at least 1 or does it have to be exactly one?': 1, 'First the miner takes a list of unconfirmed transactions that they want to put in the block (they can choose this.. they can be any transactions so long as they are valid).  Then they build a merkle tree from that set.  The merkle root goes into a "block header" which also includes a timestamp, a reference to the previous block, a nonce field, and some others.\n\nThen, in order to make the block actually valid, they need to add proof-of-work to it.  This is just a proof that a whole lot of computation was expended on that block.  They do this by varying the block header (via the nonce field and merkle root) until the hash of the block header is a sufficiently low number to meet network difficulty.  Then the block is valid and will be broadcast to the network.': 2, 'The transactions are all in the block.

When you find a hash with one leading zero, then you just created a block.\n\nWhen you find it, you tell all your friends that same data so they can verify it. If they try and use the same nonce you found, they might try and change the subsidy to their own name and collect the funds, right? Well, that changes the hash output too, so it doesn't work.

I know when I add a key to my wallet it takes like 20 minutes to rescan and find all past transactions for that address, so I'm sure my client isn't receiving a new transaction and scrolling back through everything to see if it's been included in a past block.\n\nNow maybe it doesn't have to do that. Since the output attempting to be spent is linked to the original TX its from, you would only have to scan blocks since that point maybe? But if it was an output created in one of the first blocks, today that could take awhile to process.

This is a value that when inserted into the header causes it to give a hash value within a target range. The nonce is a "proof of work".\n\nTo answer your questions, yes, miners decide which transactions go into a block. This is done before the proof of work is calculated.': 1, "It depends. This example is a very simplistic explanation of what's actually going on. \n\nBut now that you have the concept of multiple leading zeros in your head... imagine how much more difficult it may be to guess a hash with three, four, or twenty leading zeros.

(yet we can still maintain 10 minute block times)\n\nThe reason for these leading zeros is it give the protocol the ability to adjust the difficulty, based on how much computing power is being applied to block creation. Blocks being created too fast? Then let's calculate a target difficulty to have more leading zeros - that should slow the buggers down. Blocks being created too slow? Then let's calculate that target difficulty to have less leading zeros to speed it up.

A hardfork for every increase of the max block size is not desirable.\n\n* We don\'t know yet if there will be demand in the future for Bitcoin to support microtransactions on a large scale ("pay for my coffee with Bitcoin" for 1 billion people).\n\n* Increasing the cost to run a full node will reduce the number of nodes and makes Bitcoin more centralized.\n\n* Increasing the max block size will make running a full node more expensive because of increased bandwidth and computational resources that are required. \n\n* Raising the max block size has limits because of processing and bandwidth constraints.\n\n* As technology progresses, larger blocks can be supported in the future for the same cost as today (bandwidth becomes cheaper).\n\n* A sudden large increase of the max block size is a large functional change and therefore carries risk.\n\nTherefore, I think that a moderate but still exponential increase of the max block size would be the best solution for the intermediate term. For instance, a one-time increase to 5 MB followed by a 40% increase per year. That will increase the max block size tenfold in two years, and hunderfold in 9 years. It\'d amount to about 400 tps in ten years from now, and over 2000 tps in 15 years. For comparison, VISA handles 2000 tps on average.\n\nMy solution would therefore be to hardcode this moderate exponential growth into Bitcoin. We can be reasonably sure that it is a safe rate of increase, since a 40% growth is well below Moore\'s "law". Also, it creates a predictable growth, and it avoids hardforks.\n\nThis does not take other advances into account such as the lightning network or sidechains. These technologies basically defer settlement and can greatly increase the capacity of Bitcoin on their own. They may or may not be succesful - but their goals might change as capacity of Bitcoin keeps increasing exponentially over the years.\n\nOn the short term, these new technologies may be crucial to increase the capacity of Bitcoin if adoption spikes. Long term, they might be useful for instant payment confirmations or implementation of derivative contracts that generate thousands of small cash flows between parties.\n\nUltimately, if bandwidth cost keeps falling, Bitcoin as a widely adopted payment system used to pay every single coffee on the blockchain is very possible. It may however take 20 years to achieve.\n\n': 3, "That's because they want you to like them.

Most of that use has been by bitcoin investors who want to show support for it, not by people who find it actually useful.  This level of use does not justify its price nor the 600+ million of VC inestment. (Revenue from that usage would be at most 30 million dollars per year.)   Price volatility is one of the main obstacles to that use. Volatility comes from the fact that the price is speculative, which comes from its pretense of being a store of value and a profitable investment.\n\nAs a store of value: it has failed terribly in the last 15 months, bringing big losses and much grief to many people who believed that claim.  Unlike a private or Treasury bond, there is no one who is bound to return at some future time the value that was invested in it.  The future value is supposed to come from its demand as a means of e-payment; but it cannot become that if everybody hoards it.  There is no solid argument that says that it will be worth anything 2 years from now, much less that it will retain its current price.  The current state of the bitcoin economy is quite unlike the past, so the fact that it has survived for 6 years does not say much about its chances of surviving for the next 6.

There is no analyisys that authorize the claim that those millions will one day come back to those investors, except if one assumes that there will be more new investors in the future who will be willing to put even more money into the system, with no better assurances of return.\n\nIn summary, bitcoin is failing at its original goal, as well as the two others that were tacked onto it; and the speculators, hoarders, and entrepreneurs who are pursuing these two spurious goals are the main obstacle for the original one.

What if, rather than deal with the issue at the protocol level, we deal with it at the source of the problem -- the wallets.

Consequently, lots of unspent outputs just don't get used, and are left lying around until some point in the future.\n\nWhat if we started designing wallets to consolidate unspent outputs? When selecting unspent outputs for a transaction, rather than choosing just the minimum number from a particular address, why not select them ALL? Take all of the UTXOs from a particular address, send however much needs to be spent to the payee, and send the rest back to the same address as a single change output? Through this method, we should wind up shrinking the UTXO database over time rather than growing it with each transaction.\n\nThe vast majority of users are running one of a handful of different wallet apps: Electrum; Armory; Mycelium; Breadwallet; Coinbase; Circle; and maybe a few others. The developers of all these wallets have a vested interest in the continued usefulness of Bitcoin, and so should not be opposed to changing their UTXO selection algorithms to one that reduces the UTXO database instead of growing it.\n\nEdit: After-thought. Even though these types of transactions would be larger, the fee could stay low. Miners actually benefit from them in that it reduces the amount of storage they need to dedicate to holding the UTXO. So miners are incentivized to mine these types of transactions with a higher priority despite a low fee.\n\nEdit: After-After-thought. Relays could get in on the action and enforce this type of behavior by refusing to relay or deprioritizing the relay of transactions that don't use all of the available UTXOs from the addresses used as inputs.

This seems very restrictive. If the content is dynamic giving the user the newest content might be simpler and better.\n\nThe above two points are for a different use case I had in mind: blockchain-based login.\n\nHere\'s how it works:\n\n 1.  Client makes an HTTP request for /resource\n 2.  Server responds with 402 and the usual X-SWM-* headers, plus a domain name and a login token\n 3.  Client makes a payment\n 4.  Server receives the payment and "activates" the login token\n 5.  Client includes the login token in a cookie for its next and subsequent requests\n\nThis is a variation of the original scheme, but it\'s more suitable for accessing unlimited amounts of paid content on a given domain for a given period of time (i.e. the `validity` field in the ticket object). In other words, it\'s just a way to log users in using the blockchain. It\'s not really "paid content," because the payments are really tiny. It\'s more of a spam/DoS-prevention thing. You don\'t have to create an account on a website anymore; you\'re identified by your Bitcoin address, and your login token is something you actually bought (which means no need for CAPTCHAs!).

An upvote is something you have to buy, so the server first returns 402, then the client makes a payment (out of band, i.e. on the Bitcoin network), and then server "publishes" the upvote for the client to "consume."

If all transactions that happen in Xapo\'s, Coinbase\'s, Changetip\'s etc. databases would take place in blockchain, Mike Hearn\'s Crash Landing scenario would already have happened https://medium.com/@octskyward/crash-landing-f5cc19908e32\n\nThose companies (Xapo, Coinbase, Changetip...) don\'t use their own databases because of blockchain\'s capacity limitations or because they shun blockchain. They use their own databases because it is more convenient in their case. They can for example store cold wallet in a secure place and only move "database-bitcoins" when transactions happen between the accounts that they control. Only when transactions go in and out of their system they broadcast it to blockchain.': 2, 'It seems like the current active bitcoin devs are in favor of losing global adoption (of the blockchain itself, not of bitcoin as a community).\n\nI think the issue is that Bitcoin is the type of project that succeeded in spite of itself.

We need computers and networks capability to grow faster than the usage of bitcoin, which is impossible to predict. So the devs say, either A: well we need to offload the bitcoin work to these super nodes and keep mainline bitcoin the same, or B: well we need to make everyone into a super node and eliminate mainline bitcoin\n\nThere\'s no clear answer which is right, which is why there is the debate. With the web analogy, it turned out the web was good enough for desktop apps, but sucked for mobile. We can\'t predict the future, we can just analyze the present and make guesses.\n\nIt\'s pretty clear though that soon we will need super nodes. By default it looks like the super nodes will be outside of the bitcoin mainline, which is why the general community of bitcoin isn\'t generally in favor of that, they have a vested interest in seeing bitcoin be the end all be all.

The rewards don\'t even fully go away for 100 years. Also the current fees aren\'t so insignificant. The fees are currently 1/100 of the block rewards.

Global access to the network, because everyone can benefit from hard money that is not tied to a government. (See Greece, Argentina, etc..)(Large blocks + Lightning network where applicable)\n\n\nIf we're forced to use lightning networks, because direct access to raw bitcoin is too expensive, due to small blocks, then we will be living in walled gardens designed by Coinbase(banks 2.0) and governments.\n\nCensorship can happen at the mining level to some extent, but its a free market with balancing economics. Boom and bust cycles.  Centralization during big technology/energy advances, then decentralization as the competitive advantage plateaus and profit margins shrink.   It's a self balancing system.   Not everyone can run nodes, it's not economical. However, any businesses that deals with bitcoin should run a node to ensure network integrity and to have a vote.\n\nAs far as fees, miners just need to start playing with them to see how much we are willing to pay for transactions.  We pay the default fee today, even though blocks aren't full.  Raise the block size to 100MB, and the same will be true.  We pay, because we value the utility of bitcoin.

Technically, you can open one, but do you foresee doing 200+ transactions in your channel to make it worth it?  Probably not.   That leaves entities like wallet providers, exchanges, ecommerce and governments to create them.   Essentially, they must aggregate together huge chains of transactions and settle on the blockchain.  That's the only way to solve the scaling issue using small blocks.  Raw bitcoin essentially becomes a settlement network that is too expensive for you to use.\n\nMy conclusion is that you won't be able to donate to Wikileaks, because Coinbase, who has been closing accounts on people who that use darkmarkets, wont have them on their whitelist, due to government coercion.\n\nThe governments are moving into this space pretty quickly and when they see that they can have a part of crafting the rules of the road, then you can bet they will.\n\nPart of my extrapolation has to do with using chain analysis software and seeing the clusters of darkmarket activity.
