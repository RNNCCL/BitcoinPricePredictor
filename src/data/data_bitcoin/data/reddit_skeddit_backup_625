In cases of allocation like this the bank is merely a custodian and has no ownership of the bill. If the bank goes under you are still getting your safety deposit box content out \n\nExample of nonallocation: You deposit a $20 bill into your checking account. You don't expect to see that exact bill again, you simply expect the bank to owe you $20 worth of bills when you ask to withdraw. So the bank was allowed to take that original bill and mix it up with others and in the future can hand you any $20 bill to pay you back. In cases of non allocation like this you transfered ownership of the money to them and it will be subject to higher priority creditors if things go bad.\n\nEvery major exchange operates like the latter and not the former.

In fact many of these large exchange wallets have been identified by the community.\n\n>2) Do exchanges admit to doing this openly?\n\nI\'ve never seen one claim to the contrary, and some have done "proofs" by showing they have control of huge wallets, which would be indicative that they are in fact putting customer deposits all together instead of keeping each deposit separate of all the rest. \n\n>3) Would this practice be legal?\n\nIt absolutely would. There is no law in place anywhere the big exchanges are located that addresses this for them. This is even legal for traditional currency exchanges and is a pretty important legal condition for how they operate. ': 1, ">I was referring to them taking some portion of the customers' coins and using it on other things (i.e. business development, salaries, legal, lending it out etc.)\n\nAs was I. So lets pretend a company has been good about separating deposits from operational expenses, but it was still not allocating deposits(it was tossing them into big wallets). And then lets pretend that due to mismanagement they default on those operational expenses and get taken to court over them. \n\nNow it's no longer up to the company how things are paid for, it's up to a court. Since they were not allocating deposits the court must consider those deposits property of the company and therefore eligible to be used to pay back creditors, and that's exactly what the court will do. It will order those reserves tapped to pay back higher tier creditors and it will leave customers with less money. \n\nThat's why it's important to care about the rest of the budget sheet for these exchanges, because if those other parts of the budget sheet get bad and a court steps in that court is going to be using those reserves to pay salaries, utilities, lenders etc etc, entities that have higher priorities than depositing customers.

Obviously you'd think banks/investors etc. would want to avoid too much exposure to this, but a couple things got in the way.

On the other, loan originators/mortgage holders had incentive to pump out as many mortgages as possible and then usually sell them off. \n\nNaturally, many of these were eventually defaulted upon and the sub-prime sector collapsed. This alone probably wouldn't have killed the market, as sub-prime only made up something like 20%. The problem being leverage and derivatives, as these sub-prime loans were packaged into mortgage-backed securities/derivatives/instruments and the collapse of the sub-prime market compounded through the economy. \n\nThis led in part to the wide-spread liquidity crunch on top of the housing bubble collapse etc. etc. which killed spending/investment into a nasty feedback loop.

But it\'s at least plausible and it seems clear the defense is trying to establish this, so maybe there is something to it. And perhaps they even have some cards they haven\'t turned over yet that would make this scenario look even more plausible.\n\nAnyway -- Previously some people were speculating that MK may have tipped the feds off about RU, just in order to get immunity from prosecution on MSB crimes and/or perhaps even to take the heat off of himself as the alleged DPR.\n\nThat would certainly fit with what Dratel\'s cross-ex has so far revealed: that Karpeles was the primary suspect for years, by multiple different DHS task forces, until they all suddenly congealed around RU as the perpetrator a little after they leaned on MK with the asset seizure and then got his lawyers to start talking.\n\nHowever, according to the [prosecution\'s letter to the judge regarding the Rule 807 Testimony](http://ia600603.us.archive.org/21/items/gov.uscourts.nysd.422824/gov.uscourts.nysd.422824.154.0.pdf), although MK\'s lawyers offered for MK to meet with the Baltimore Office DHS US Attorneys in Guam and give the name of DPR in return for favorable treatment (with regards to the 18 USC 1960 money service business law / US bank account asset seizure stuff), this meeting never occurred:\n\n>However, the meeting never materialized. SA Der-Yeghiayan was never told what specific information Mr. Karpeles had available to provide concerning Silk Road or what the provenance of it was. \n\nWhich would seem not to support the theory that MK tipped off the feds about RU, or tried to scapegoat him, or otherwise snitched in exchange for immunity.\n\nBUT THEN... further on in the document it states:\n\n>Several days after the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s arrest on October 1, 2013, which was publicly disclosed the following day, the U.S. Attorney\xe2\x80\x99s Office for the Southern District of New York (\xe2\x80\x9cUSAO-SDNY\xe2\x80\x9d) was contacted by Mr. Karpeles \xe2\x80\x99 attorney . The attorney offered to forward records associated with a certain suspicious MtGox account that he stated he had previously sent to AUSA2 in USAO-Baltimore. \n\nSo it seems that although there was no Guam meeting, MK (through his Mt Gox staff or lawyers) did indeed *send* information to the Baltimore office -- prior to RU\'s arrest -- about a Mt Gox account that could be traced back to RU. \n\nMoreover, [Exhibit E in the letter to the judge - an email from MtGox regarding the suspicious account](http://ia600603.us.archive.org/21/items/gov.uscourts.nysd.422824/gov.uscourts.nysd.422824.154.5.pdf) references a meeting in Baltimore with feds:\n\n> " As we described to you during our meeting in Baltimore, it has been possible to open a MtGox account without providing verification materials." \n\nWhich means some sort of deal having took place between the Baltimore Office feds and MK is not wholly precluded. \n\nAlthough there was a seizure warrant against Gox subsidiary Mutum Sigillum\'s US dollar assets (~5.5m I think) based on contravention of 18 USC 1960 and other statutes, AFAIK criminal charges have not been brought against MK for 18 USC 1960 violations (although this statute does carry fines and up to 5 years imprisonment, in addition to triggering asset seizure). \n\nSo one explanation for no criminal charges against MK is that there was a deal struck. Another explanation I suppose could be that there is a corporate veil protecting MK here. Or simply that the case is seen as difficult to prosecute (Asset seizures are a much lower evidentiary standard than criminal convictions). I doubt extradition would be an issue though, Japan and US have a [bilateral treaty](http://internationalextraditionblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/japan.pdf) which includes "46. An offense against the laws relating to the control of exportation and importation or international transfer of funds" and "47. Attempt, conspiracy, assistance, solicitation, preparation for, or participation in, the commission of any of the above mentioned offenses "\n\n\n\nNow, **IF** MK was the primary DPR, as well as running Mt Gox, that would have given him enormous leverage over both the bitcoin market, and over the finances and financial records of a large percentage of people conducting bitcoin commerce at the time (since Mt Gox was basically the only BTC exchange during SR1\'s tenure). Mt Gox would have been the premier clearinghouse for tying real world identifiers (National ID documents, emails, login IP addresses) to bitcoin addresses. So **IF** MK was the primary DPR, who bought SR from Ross anonymously, he may have had a huge information asymmetry compared to the seller, and had a trivial time figuring out Ross\'s identity which he then held onto as a trump card in case of attention from the feds.\n\nEven if MK had nothing to do with SR in reality, this doesn\'t preclude that he made some sort of deal with the feds in order to get the MSB criminal charges dropped. MK could have leveraged his position as an information broker of tying bitcoin addresses to identities/aliases to gain favorable treatment.\n\nIt\'s also possible that the feds still suspect Karpeles and that a secret precondition of his immunity was also freezing Mt Gox\'s bitcoin assets while Ross\'s case is ongoing. This would explain the missing Gox coins and makes more sense than that amount getting lost due to transaction malleability. I think some people on this sub have advanced the suspicion before that Mark is under a gag order and the coins are really under the control of the feds as part of their ongoing Silk Road investigation. \n\nIn support of this, the feds did [justify their seizure of Gox\'s bank accounts](http://www.deepdotweb.com/2014/01/13/last-year-mt-gox-seizures-linked-to-silk-road-in-fed-testimonies/) in part by saying they were moving  finances into the Silk Road, and that the seizure was actually a part of the ongoing SR investigation!\n\n\n\nBut, this is all pure conjecture and I\'m not sure I really believe anything I just wrote, just fun to speculate about.\n\n\nEDIT1: Thanks for gilding my wild conjectures, whoever it was.\n\nEDIT2: MK is in thread, [Oh hi Mark](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=ISXiFJS9D5A#t=2), please don\'t sue me for libel': 13, "It was an account under a different name (see [Docket 154](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/24900303/1-14-cr-00068-KBF-154.zip) [Exhibit E](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/24900303/1-14-cr-00068-KBF-154/154-5.pdf) where you have a copy of an email from MtGox's lawyer sending said information to Turner).\nI learned of Ulbricht at the same time as everyone else, when his arrest made the news.": 11, "> It should be noted that the defense could probably subpoena the Baltimore HSI agents to testify.

Hardware Backdoor's are real and more prevalent than you can imagine. The only way to be sure you aren't susceptible is to design and build your own CPU and computer system. Fabricating your own silicon chips is a surprisingly simple process, as all you really need is some sand.\n\n*    Once you've hand manufactured your CPU, Motherboard, RAM, and IO devices, you'll need to write a C compiler that will compile down to your CPU's native language. Writing your own compiler will keep you safe from the Ken Thompson Hack.\n\n*    Create a simple OS that you can use to access the internet. Some people might suggest using Linux, but there are 9,868,933 lines of code in just the Kernel, most of which you won't need, and personally verifying every line for rootkits might take a bit longer than you have the patience for.\n\n*    Create your own bitcoin client. Satoshi's client could possess hidden back doors, or they could have been introduced since his departure. The classic create-a-currency-to-compromise-a-users-computer-attack is devastating, and we can't rule Satoshi out. Bottom line is that you cannot be sure.\n\n*    Dig a very deep hole into the earth, and surround it with at least three feet of re-enforced concrete. Place your custom PC in there. Thermal imaging attacks can easily penetrate the walls of your home, and reveal your private keys to any wayward onlooker, or high tech peeping tom. A sufficiently deep hole will also protect you against common keystroke sound vibration attacks. Also, if you've had any help so far, this hole will double as their grave. Loose ends are security holes.\n\n*    Before generating your public private key pair, carefully run your hands over your head to ensure that you don't have any suspicious electrodes attached to your skull. Mind Reading technology is real.\n\n*    Once your wallet is setup, Quantum Encrypt it so that any attempts to access it will immediately destroy the information.\n\n*    This is the most important: Never leave your re-enforced hole in the ground. Leaving your hole makes you susceptible to the highly effective (despite what Bill O'Reilly would have you believe) water-boarding-private-key-extraction-attack.\n\nSource: [A long time computer security expert](http://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1e4b9s/the_only_truly_secure_way_to_use_bitcoin_from_a/)\n": 6, "It's a joke account who rewrites your comment to be less dickish.

In fact, fractional reserve banking was really just an intermediate step on the way to what we have today.\n\nImagine your scenario with Bitcoin where people started trading virtual bitcoins as if they were good as bitcoins themselves, and the issuer of those virtual bitcoins then said, "you know what, everyone would be better if we just got rid of Bitcoin entirely and just used our virtual bitcoins instead!" Say everyone agreed to this. That would be closer to what we have today with fiat money. \n\nPeople are under the slightly mistaken impression that fractional reserve banking still exists because there is a reserve requirement, where banks are required to have a certain amount of money in the account with their respective central bank which acts as the base money. Instead of gold, or in your example bitcoins, they have an account at the central bank and the money in there represents "real" money somehow. The idea is that the central bank can alter the reserve ratios and therefore limit how much fractional reserve lending occurs. \n\nThe reality, according to a [recent report from the Bank of England](http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Documents/quarterlybulletin/2014/qb14q1prereleasemoneycreation.pdf), is that reserves at the central bank are really only for the purpose of intra-bank transactions. That is, when banks transfer money to other banks, it happens through the accounts held at the central bank. So if bank A owes bank B money the central bank can simple deduct it from bank A\'s account and type it into bank B\'s account. The larger the bank, the more money it will require be held at the central bank for simple utility purposes, not because the banking system is trying to act as if gold still exists. \n\nThe only thing limiting lending at this stage is essentially market forces and central bank monetary policies. The Bank of England, for example, has no formal reserve requirements. The limits from fractional reserve lending are really a thing of the past. \n\nThere is also the view that banks require a certain amount of deposits on hand in order to create new loans. But bank deposits are actually simply a record of how much the bank owes to other people. That is, bank deposits are not an asset for banks, they are a liability. Banking doesn\'t work the way it used to, where banks require us to put money in them so they can lend out that money to others. Banks don\'t need deposits, they create them (when they make loans). \n\nBanks create deposits when they make loans, and since almost all of the money in circulation is in the form of bank deposits, it means almost all of the money comes with corresponding debt, debt that usually includes interest. Since the amount of debt equals the amount of money in existence, if all of the debts were repaid there wouldn\'t be any money left. Worse, since most of that debt comes with interest, there isn\'t actually even enough money in existence to pay back all of the debt. And, finally, because all money is created as debt . . . there never will be enough money to pay back our debts. \n\nThis is why the fiat money system requires constant inflation, because inflation makes it easier to pay back loans, and because a constant supply of new loans is required to create new money - money that is needed to pay back existing debts - if the situation should ever turn into deflation were people couldn\'t pay back their loans or take out new loans, the whole system would collapse. \n\n\n\nhttp://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Documents/quarterlybulletin/2014/qb14q1prereleasemoneycreation.pdf ': 2, "Did you read your comment?

In other words you cannot avoid making backups.

So then the money supply has to be adjusted by the government and/or the central bank to save the economy. The less disruptive way to do that is to bail out the failed bank, essentially making those virtual dollars into real ones. Resulting in a situation were banks can create money at will, money on which they collect interests.\n\nWith Bitcoin this could happen too if people's perception makes those virtual bitcoins valued as much as bitcoins you control yourself. This would enable fractional reserve, and eventually economic crashes. Although in such a crash, no one will be able to bail out the bitcoin bank and the economy will suffer proportionally to the size of the bank. And eventually people will learn not to trust banks.

If that's what concerns you, don't worry about them stealing your money or something. I'd trust them with all my BTC, they've never stolen any coins or taken any non responsible decision as far as I'm concerned. \n\nHowever what you can't make sure when you're buying a mining contract is that it's ran legitimately. That's why I think it's always not that of a good idea to invest into such a thing (besides all the unpredictability with the difficulty etc that could make it useless in just two difficulty shifts). Even if the mining operation is controlled by someone like cryptsy, it's still hard for them to prove that they're not a ponzi scheme. And to this point, only the operations above have proven that they're not in fact ponzi schemes. Maybe zeushash too [but](http://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-miner-zeushash-faces-cloud-service-shutdown/) ... \n\nThe *legit* ones though still put more risk towards the side of the investor, and don't seem that of attractive when compared to shady alternatives. \n\nIf what you're looking to do is to diversify your assets, you should really look to other alternatives. Don't be fooled by the shiny word **mining**. Other investments can earn you a faster ROI with less risk of loosing your initial input. Take trading of (almost) any kind as an example out of the many other alternatives.  \n\nTL;DR You shouldn't be worried about the mining operation you're invested in being ran by a non reputable company, the state and business tactics of the entire industry of cloud mining is what's more worrying.

Bitmain for example is one company I would consider likely to be legitimate, and the 500 TH project worked out just fine.

I invested half of it into MN already and I'm in a nice position because the price of MN has increased in value a little bit in the last couple days. My plan was to invest the full $1000 in MN and lay back and watch the value of MN and btc rise while I accumulate btc every single day with my shares. Any thoughts about my plan bro?

There are several scenarios, ideally the difficulty could stay the same or even drop and in that case those plans might have the potential to keep spewing bitcoins at you for years but that seems unlikely. Mining plans tend to lose value over time (take cex.io's case as an example look at where the buy for Gh/s price started and where it ended) all because of the difficulty increases. \n\nIf you're comfortable with all this and still think that this investment will earn you a ROI over time then keep your mining shares without worry.
