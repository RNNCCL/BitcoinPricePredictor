What needs and is happening is more wallets and services being brought online that are color aware. The reason we highly suggest the use of ghcloud for asset management is the fact that its not hosted anywhere but on your pc, you have full control over the private keys, they use blockstrap to relay txs to the network so nothing is ever hosted anywhere but under your control.

Let's discuss", 12): {"In that regard, the blockchain is like a public locker room in a library, or a maildrop shop; and an address is a single locker compartment in that locker room, or a single maibox in that shop.  Your key gives you possession of what is inside the box, but not ownership: it does not prove that you are the legitimate proprietor.  \n\nYour property is defined by your government. It is what your government thinks that you have the right to posses; and the rights that you have are those that your government is capable and willing to enforce, with its police, courts and (if necessary) guns. \n\nTo get possession of some bitcoins you only need to get them into an address whose private key is known to you and nobody else.  To get ownership, you must do so in a way that your government approves.\n\nGovernments generally do not approve theft; that is, when someone takes bitcoins (or anthing else) from their current owner, without the latter's permission. (Indeed, governments were invented precisely to curb theft.)   Even if a thief gets possession of your bitcoins, they remain your property, and your government is bound (at least in theory) to try to get them back into your possession, and punish the thief.\n\nGovernments also do not approve if you take possession of some bitcoins without paying any taxes that may be due on them.  From their point of view, the tax due is property of the government, not yours; and so they will use their power to get that money to the rightful owner, i.e. themselves. \n\nThere are other ways of gaining possession of bitcoins that governments do not approve, but they may vary from government to government.  \n\nWhile your government and your country's  laws determine whether you are the owner of some bitcoins, when they get stolen you may find it hard to convince the government that (1) you are indeed their legitmate owner, that (2) the coins are no longer in your possession, and that (3) they are in possession of the thief.  For (1), you will need at least some receipts, emails, screenshots, etc..  For the (2) and (3), I have no idea how you could do it.\n\nTLDR: The blockchain only establishes the possession of bitcoins, not their ownership.  The latter is defined by a government and its laws.
