Number one on that list is going over 51% as it has a significant impact on price, especially if the 51% is sustained or grows.\n\n- Most of the miners you see on the [hash distribution pie chart](https://blockchain.info/pools) are pools. That means that they are collectives of independent miners working together. If the pool operator goes rogue then those miners will start to move away from that pool to other pools as it affects their income. The best example for that is GHash.IO, who went from 50+% down to 15% right now. \n\nDon't let that chart fool you. There are a LOT of mining outfits and all of them are in it for the money, plain and simple. Anything that affects them will be dealt with. If a pool operator, or a cartel of pool operators tries to force a protocol change or starts to block miners from moving their funds, then the participants of those pools will move away.\n\nThe power over bitcoin isn't as concentrated as you make it out to be. \n\n": 0, 'The fundamental principle of the bitcoin protocol is that clients always assume the longest consistent chain that they see is the true one.

I don't mine but I do know financial market participant behavior. You nailed it. ": 1, 'Ok, just to be clear.  Lets say the normal blockchain is A, the cartel blockchain is B.  What would occur is the core devs (gavin andressen et al) would implement a new algo via a software update and hardfork.  This would mean that a new version of chain A would exist after the hardfork lets call that chain C.  This chain would only be minable via the new algo.  So the cartel cannot add blocks to this chain, only chains A and B in your example. ': 1, '> the core devs would just change the mining algo\n\nThis also requires a hardfork?  Old nodes will not recognize the new blocks as valid.': 1, 'The paper makes two unproven claims:\n\n> **There are only two manipulations a controlling pool could attempt**^(1): refusing to validate specific transactions (which prevents people from sending bitcoins between addresses) or reversing transactions the pool sends during the time it is in control. **Such actions would likely lead to a huge decline in the value of bitcoin, if not a complete collapse of the entire system.**^(2) So would it be worth it for a pool of miners to manipulate the blockchain? \n\nFor many bitcoin users -- including the Chinese day-traders, who currently define its price -- a moderate degree of "manipulation" may be irrelevant, or even perceived as beneficial.  For example, the majority cartel may decide to "rewind" partially the blockchain in order to undo transactions that were determined to be thefts or huge blunders.  Or it may starve a mining center operated by a terrorist organization.\n\nWithout that second bolded premise (2), the conclusion of that section does not follow.   It *may* in fact be worth for a majority cartel to manipulate the blockchain.\n\nAs for the first bolded premise (1), the cartel can also use its transaction blocking power to force clients to upgrade to a modified protocol.  For example, it could change the protocol so as to postpone the next block halving -- and the consequent fee increase -- for several years.

The core devs just need to release a hardfork update, and new blocks would be incorporated by people mining the new algo, whatever that is.

Precisely because miners are financially motivated, not ideologically motivated, it is quite possible that a majority cartel will want to use the power that they have to increase their revenue.\n\nThe price will not necessarily crash to zero if the protocol changes, just as the dollar does not crash to zero when the government bails out banks or prints extra money.  Suppose the cartel wants to keep the block reward at 25 BTC indefinitely.  Would that cause users to jump ship?  Only ideologues care about the inviolability of the protocol.  The day traders who set the price will not care. People who use it for payments will not care.  Long-term investors may be scared, but they will continue holding as long as the current price stays well above their investment price.  Depending on the change, the effect on price may even be positive; e.g. the change could prevent a drastic reduction of the network\'s capacity.\n\nMiners in a pool that is part of the cartel will have to choose between staying with the cartel, and support the protocol change (which presumably means more revenue for them too), or deserting and keep mining the "orthodox" fork, and then risk having their blocks orphaned and/or their rewards frozen by the cartel.\n\nAs for Ghash.io, they may simply have split the pool into 2-3 pools that appear to be independent, but in fact are still owned by the same group.': 3, 'Yes of course.

The blockchain technology on the other hand is a genuine breakthrough that will continue to have value even if Bitcoin were to collapse. Mind you I'm not talking about separating Bitcoin from the blockchain. You will always need an incentive structure to make a blockchain self sustaining.": 3, "> Proof-of-work-based blockchain security relies on economic incentives. \n\nYes, it does, but the incentive doesn't have to be by creating new currency tokens.\n\nThe blockchain is just a very good record-keeping system.  Notaries and county courthouses have been validating records for centuries for a fee.  A blockchain substitute for legal records can operate via the same kind of fee as the incentive.  Finding block hashes then is just an overhead cost, like buying file cabinets to store paper records.\n\nAn internal incentive, like bitcoin uses, makes starting up easier by attracting miners.  But record-keeping in general is a vast part of the economy.  There is plenty of external incentives if you have a system with better features.

Or vice versa. You can't seperate them. Bitcoin is the only incentive to keep the blockchain alive and decentralized. ": 3, 'I don\'t think they say otherwise, to me obvious by the fact that they use the word "pegging". You can\'t get Bitcoin out of the blockchain, and you can\'t secure the blockchain without the incentive of Bitcoin. They are inseparable. Haven\'t seen any comment from Blockstream conflicting with this viewpoint.\n\nSay, you created a multi-sig address scheme controlled by a few people, and through that created a separate transaction mechanism using units pegged to the value of bitcoins. It could be something like a more secure ChangeTip, or a federated side-chain. Now, the coins are "locked" in the Bitcoin blockchain, and the unit-of-account is being freely traded. Is it really Bitcoin though? Looks to me like IOU\'s.\n\nTheir current proposal is considering proof-of-work as a sort of multi-sig that has dynamic members, thereby doing away with trust in pre-determined entities. It is similar in nature to what we call trustless in the context of Bitcoin, in that you trust in the incentives, not people. I don\'t claim it will work (have debated this and saw the missing pieces), but I don\'t see how they make grandiose claims about the nature of bitcoins either.\n': 2, 'As it has been said before, bitcoin (as everything else) can fail.\n\nThe concept will live on forever though.': 0, 'Basically, blockchain technology is out of the bag now.

The important part is existence of a common currency which is used for transaction fees.\n\nBitcoin PoW consensus mechanism works when there is a constant and relatively predictable stream of rewards which are there to be claimed by any miner who produced proof-of-work.\n\nNow imagine that miners are rewarded via some kind of private deals. You can't analyze such a system, and thus you can't trust it. Who knows, today miners keep the network secure, tomorrow they'll help to facilitate an attack.\n\nIf miners' incentive structure is not well-understood, you'll be better off with a network of non-anonymous notaries.": 2, 'Like Jesus and God.': 1, 'Then why the fuck do the Blockstream people say otherwise?

I don't think so. Bitcoin has so much momentum and it's still dynamic, still being developed and improving, I don't see any other cryptocurrency displacing it anytime soon. But sure, it's possible.\n\nBut the blockchain without any cryptocurrency? No, the concept of the blockchain is based on an incentive structure which requires there to be a token that has value: the cryptocurrency. Removing this token would pretty much alter the concept of a blockchain to the extent you should probably start to call the whole thing something completely other than a cryptocurrency powered blockchain.": 1, 'for now its the only incentive, there are already other products being developed using blockchain technology that have nothing to do with Bitcoin.\n\nhttp://storj.io is one that comes to mind.': 1, 'bitcoin can fail, cryptomoney can go on.\n\nIt does not even have to be blockchain based technology, if ppl can solve what bitcoin solves without block, e.g. say the unit of ledger goes by transaction.\n\nHowever, if bitcoin does not fail and such technologies are to be invented, they will never surpass bitcoin.': -7, '244 bits /u/changetip (sorry, my last ones before I redeposit).': 2, 'Blockchain can fail, but not bitcoin.

My current co-packer facility does what is called "hot filling" of bottles, which essentially sterilizes the glass as it fills at 205\xc2\xb0F (just below boiling).  Unfortunately this makes the filling of PET type bottles impossible, as it\'d cause the plastic to melt, or risk contamination.\n\nThe alternative is for me to use HDPE bottles (that milky white plastic in milk jugs)... which is what I use on my 1/2 gallon commercial size. However it won\'t look right for the small ones. I want people to be able to see my product.\n\nWhat I am going to have to do is save some $$, and find a filling facility that can run PET bottles through chemical / gas sterilization (usually ammonia) and a dryer before filling.  This is the same process the "big companies" use before filling Soda bottles or Heinz ketchup bottles.

They essentially ship a pallet to these warehouses, and their orders get pulled and packed with other international bulk-rate goods that all go overseas together.

However, "store of value" is a slightly misleading name for this utility. It is more common to call similar things of value *collectibles*. People collect things like: gold, silver, old cars, rare paintings, rare stamps, gems, ... Different collectibles have different liquidities, gold is probably the most liquid collectible at present.\n\nI strongly object against saying that "gold is backed up by fiat money", though. That is mistaken. Even if fiat money lose their value in hyperinflation, it is not likely that gold experiences the same crisis together with the fiat money.\n\nWhile bitcoin is currently used (to some extent) as a medium of exchange, its main utility is the same as the main utility of gold: it is collectible. The problem is that many people call this use (in case of bitcoin) "speculation", mistakenly thinking that when you do not buy bitcoins to immediately spend them for goods, you are a "speculator". The reason why this is wrong is that *speculation* is defined as short-term trading. Any long-term usage does not fit the definition.': 2, 'Well, this is only a part of the story. If you want to take a "red pill", you can go futher.

Some properties can be considered intrinsic, but not this one.\n\n> I didn\'t write anywhere that "scarcity" is a intrinsic property of gold.\n\nYes, I know, but you proposed gold has "intrinsic value", which, since the value is based on scarcity, implies that scarcity would have to be intrinsic.\n\nIn contrast to gold, bitcoin does have intrinsic scarcity, because it has been designed to be scarce.': 1, '> Intrinsic value for you is a inherent purpose to achieve a goal (scarcity of Bitcoins for instance).\n\nA little misunderstanding. I claim that bitcoin does have intrinsic scarcity, because it has been designed to be scarce, scarcity is its design, i.e., intrinsic, property. You can examine bitcoin and find out it is scarce, because that is a part of bitcoin specification, a part of what bitcoin is. However, the other necessary requirement to have a value is to be useful, and nothing has "intrinsic utility", since utility is how people use the thing, which is always extrinsic to the thing itself. Nobody really knows (we may only guess) how will people use gold 100 years from now. Therefore the economic theory argues that bitcoin (as well as everything else) does not have intrinsic value.\n\nedit: add explanatory note': 1, 'You didn\'t understand what I wrote.

Notice that scarcity is not intrinsic to gold. It is a property you cannot detect however thoroughly you examine a gold bullion.\n\nBut I didn\'t write anywhere that "scarcity" is a intrinsic property of gold.

This is what gives Bitcoin a certain intrinsic value as real resources were consumed to create it.

If bitcoin price were lower it would follow that many miners would turn off, driving the floor down.  \n\nAll that $80 represents is a very rough estimate of the energy cost per mined coin.  Network energy consumption was substantially lower when price was lower and there was less mining activity.  \n\nPrice could fall below $80 and some people would still mine.

But it's not wasted, it's all used for securing the blockchain.\n\nFun fact:\nEven at 80MW - 80,000 kW/h - at $0.15 per kWh, the power usage is $12,000 per hour or about $288,000 per day.\n\nSo with 3600 coins mined per day, the reward for keeping the blockchain secure, the power at least, is $80 per coin.

Also, the finance sector of the world is millions of times bigger than bitcoin. Probably billions or more if you include HFT.

Decentralization is expensive.": 2, 'It depends on how many coins were mined for $80 / piece.\n\nWhat if 75% of coins get mined at that price?

There are some major economic implications to running older generation hardware. The question is -- does this reflect reality? My guess is that it could easily be off by an order of magnitude in either direction.\n\nCalculations like these are sensitive to what hardware is really being run.

They both do *about* 0.5w/gh at the wall. Bitfury, however, doesn't sell their miners to the general public. Their current gen chips are known to have similar efficiency to spondoolies/KnC chips, but they have the ability to underclock to an even higher efficiency if necessary (less hashrate, but much less power draw). \n\nNext generation chips are all speculation, but I'll just fire off the rumours being discussed in mining subforums. ASICMINER is estimating 0.3W/Gh by Q1 2014, Bitfury is speculated to produce 0.1W/GH in a few months [citation needed], and KnC is **claiming** an efficiency of 0.07W/GH with their next gen sometime in the future. Cointerra also claims to have a high-efficiency miner coming to market--but don't believe those assholes. \n\nEdit: Also, any hardware above 1.5w/gh is starting to become unprofitable to run, once you factor in hosting costs.

Not everyone is going to break a profit.\n\nRealistically, the cost of mining a coin is likely substantially higher than $80.  It would follow that the marginal cost for each new bitcoin is probably much closer to the current market price.  As price drops, inefficient miners are going to drop out of the mining game.
