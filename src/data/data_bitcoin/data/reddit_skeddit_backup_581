Companies like Apple are very good at doing this on a number of their products, hence why every year the company profits go up.\n\n2) it can lower the sell price, and make the product available to a wider market. With more people able to buy, the company is able to sell more. An example of this is Ford at the beginning of the automotive revolution, hence their profit goes up.\n\nIts up to a company to decide the right balance between the 2 options.\n\nHowever, both of these things relies on the ability of consumers to have available funds to buy. With controlled inflation, people are not encouraged to hoard, and are enabled to borrow if they need/want to. With deflation, people are encouraged to hoard, and are discouraged to borrow, even if they need to. You can grab a piece of paper and make a table/matrix, and work out the perato superior choices)[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_efficiency]. With consumers, it doesn't matter what price your cellphone will be next year, people will forgo buying it if they feel discouraged from buying, sounds kinda obvious right? On a macro-scale, without people buying things, new industries will have a tough time trying to convince investors (who would already be discouraged from investing under deflation) to lend them money to take the chance on selling a new product that consumer dont know yet if they want. \n\nTo address your example of cheaper smartphones every year: thats (depreciation)[http://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/depreciation.asp], ie the utility lifecycle of a tool (smartphone) only goes for so long, knowledge of this encourages buyers to seek out a newer version at the end of the products lifespan, however they are further encouraged to make the deal if the item is cheaper this year than it was the last year they bought the product. So a company tries to meet this expectation by being technological progressive each year, if they dont, then competition will do it and consumers will go there instead. So two things at play: 1) the company is able to lower its cost of production by technological and strategic advancement and 2) the electronics industry tends to choose #2 from above and tries to make the product cheaper so that they can sell more to more people.
