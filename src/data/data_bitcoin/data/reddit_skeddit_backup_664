There is no limit to how much btc you can send to your Bitreserve wallet once you become a member. There is a limit per transfer of 50btc. But you can transfer 50btc X whatever you want. When you send BTC to your dollar (or euro, pound, yen, yuan, gold card), we convert it at the prevailing spot rate to the fiat or commodity (gold) value you chose. You are no longer exposed to btc volatility.\n\nHere's a quick example. Let's say you have 100 btc sitting in your coinbase account and after the bitstamp imbroglio you decide that you only want to hold your btc with a financial service that is real-time transparent so that you know your value is safe (Btireserve is the only one that has a real-time proof of solvency-- we are overreserved in fact).\n\nYou open a BR account at bitreserve.org and send 50 btc to the btc address of your dollar card and 50btc to the btc address of your gold card. Once the bitcoin network confirms the btc transfers, we credit your dollar card with 50btc x the prevailing btc/usd spot rate at the time of the confirmation and we credit your gold card with 50btc X the prevailing btc/usd/gld spot rate. On the back end, we sell your btc and buy dollars and gold, which we hold in our reserve. \n\nIf btc subsequently goes to $2, you are not impacted. And you can spend btc right from your USD and GLD cards on Bitreserve. Whenever you feel like it, you can convert value on your USD and GLD cards back to BTC, just by transferring value to your btc card.\n\nLet's say you transfer those 100 btc to USD and GLD when btc is at $200. If it goes to $100/btc, you can then purchase twice as much bitcoin (or more depending on how GLD moves against USD).\n\nWith Bitreserve you can flip back and forth as many times as you want with no settlement delays. Our forex commissions are very low and we are committed to driving them lower and lower. We currently charge .45% to convert btc to usd and 2.4% to convert btc to gld. Our forex commissions cover our volatility exposure as we execute the value conversions and reallocate assets in our reserve.\n\nI hope this answers your questions and that you will become a Bitreserve Member. We've seen a lot of btc come over in the wake of this Bitstamp hack. I suspect that our real-time transparency is something people are going to be valuing more and more.

But there is also many rewards/benefits for moving value into Bitreserve: 1. hold your bitcoin anyway you feel comfortable--five currencies and gold with many more currencies and stores of value coming in 2015--but still spend it or send it on the bitcoin Network from any store of value (e.g. send bitcoin from your gold card), 2. instant value transfer between BR members in any currency, including bitcoin, 3. real-time transparency of all our systems liabilities and assets.\n\n>Really just another middleman between you and a bitcoin exchange.\n\nA middleman, true, but very different from the traditional finance sector middlemen because, being a cloud-based service, we enable free and instant value transfer, low-cost value conversions, and we do it all with real-time transparency. We aspire to extend bitcoin's primary benefits--fast, cheap value transfer and real-time transparency--to all stores of value, not just bitcoin, and to make moving the value instant and free.

I'm going to review our FAQ to make sure this is clearer. We currently generate revenue from forex commissions, but this is not our long-term business model. In a few years, once we understand our liquidity needs very well, we will invest some part of the reserve in yield-bearing cash equivalents. For example, if we have an aggregate of $1bn in our members wallets, we'd invest a portion of the $1bn we hold in our reserve in T-bills.  Because we write out every change in assets in our reserve, everyone will know that we're doing this.\n\nCryptographic proof works for our bitcoin assets in our reserve that substantiate the value of the aggregate bitcoin held in our members' wallets. In addition to a quarterly reserve audit, we're working on other real-time proof of non-bitcoin assets in our reserve.  \n\nThanks everyone. I find your community inspiring.

Instead of disintermediating banks, Crypto 2.0 will disintermediate all kinds of other services - including servers.\n\nAs we're not selling anything or asking the community for money, I have little problem pointing out that my company, Eris, has released a free to use, open-source DApp platform (not a cryptocurrency) which will allow people to build [blockchain-based applications](https://blog.erisindustries.com/products/2014/12/27/step-by-step-eris/). The blockchain component is based on Ethereum tech - except entirely free of charge, no token purchase required. \n\nThe blockchains hold the application logic, and devs can roll as many chains as they like, over which they are free to set any parameters they wish and are in total control, without paying us a dime. We've also got some useful dev tools, including a comprehensive smart contract testing environment called [EPM](https://epm.io) which will allow you to test your smart contract suites pretty straightforwardly.\n\nFeel free to [try it for yourself](https://decerver.io/tutorials). The platform's built to work with Bitcoin (and BTCD so you can run a full node on it); any other protocol (e.g. HyperLedger or BitTorrent) can be integrated into it by simply writing a module wrapper (it's modular). Our first DApp (coming out in two weeks or so - we'll be open-sourcing the code the moment it's done) will be a distributed YouTube with a Bitcoin payment module - just a few steps away from doing full-on Bitcoin-enabled distributed DRM.\n\nWe of course have our [own subreddit as well](http://reddit.com/r/erisindustries) for any specific discussion on what we do - no need to clog up /r/bitcoin going forward!": -3, "We're being more conservative, and doing the work to put the code and protocols through rigorous security review before launching.

Churn is the rate at which nodes (machines) leave the network. In a datacenter, nodes leave when there is a hardware fault. In a P2P network like storj, people who rent out their hardware can simply decide to stop cooperating. Or maybe their power goes out, or they reboot, or they just don't want to leave their machine running all the time. At any rate, churn in a P2P network is orders of magnitude higher than in a datacenter. This means storj must distribute their data to a larger number of machines to ensure the same number of 'nines' (e.g. 99.999% availability).\n\nSo what storj is doing is exactly the same as what S3 and Dropbox do, but only with more expensive hardware, on a really shitty network (the internet), and with huge amounts of churn.

If nobody's sharing drive space because prices are too low, prices rise and incentivise other people to join the network.\n\nAs to why you'd want all of this P2P, there's one huge advantage that's worth any other sacrifices made: nobody else can look at your data but you. Nobody can prevent you access to your data. Celebritygate, or the fappening, or whatever you want to call it as an example, would never have happened.

Completely decentralized file sharing, websites, applications, pretty much anything could use storj.\n\nTo the traditionalists if current cloud services are by default more superior explain why bitorrent is still faster than any cloud storage solutions. As to the churn that is reduced by the monetization using storjcoin. Drive share users are encouraged to upgrade their hardware and to keep sharing by the people who are paying to use the service.\n\nThe biggest risk I see for Storj is its dependence on The bitcoin blockchain and its slow block confirmation time. But that risk has already been addressed, I believe, by early statements by the Storj team not ruling out going to a custom coin of their own if they run into any issues.': 6, "What browser/os are you using?

I will personally benefit by helping promote bitcoin world-wide and elevating bitcoin to the next level by helping the foundation publish standards and certifications in our industry. Not only will my personal bitcoin holdings increase in value, but I will achieve a sense of personal pride in what I helped the industry accomplish through my efforts.\n\nThanks for guiding my personal reflection on these points!": 1, "I do derive benefit from my non-profit work, yes, but I do not derive income from them.\n\nThe benefits I get are the same benefits everyone in the bitcoin space gets.

It was easy to create a coin, pre-mine the coin, Pump it and dump it.... After a while, the Alt community caught on, and avoid pre-mined coins for the most part. There are ways around this....hidden premises or fucking with the set amount of coins after initial releases.    \n\n\n  \n There are Altcoin devs that are pure, and not scam artists, but  Pump and dump groups are really common and known in the alt community.

Then slowly pump the price, and volume while praising the developer and the coin.   \n  \n Innocent investors see the new coin with high volume and a rising price, The Dev checks out, because he's not apart of the scam. So, everyone invests thinking this is the next great coin. The pump group spikes the price then dumps.   \n\n  \n This happens just as often as scam coins. I liked a lot of alts, and still own a few, but I no longer invest, because these pump groups ruin coins and the reputation of alts.

Single anonymous developer who refuses to collaborate with others.\n2. Developers who make claims about their technical ability which don\'t match reality, or make false claims about other coins. For example, claiming to have fixed bugs in the source they forked but being unable to name any such bugs or the fixes, and handing out forum bans to anyone who asks about this.\n3.

Failure to even make enough changes that their coin is sufficiently different from the one they forked, leading to cross-contamination between clients and blockchains which harms both coins.\n6. No source code revision history, just point release tarballs or no source at all. Usually done in order to hide the fact they\'ve made little to no changes beyond the inept search-and-replace.\n7. Claims such as "P2P distributed exchange" or "guaranteed price floor" or other features which are mathematically and/or economically impossible.\n8. Claims that built-in taxation and/or premine (which goes directly to the developer) will be used to promote the coin, stabilize the price, or protect users - even though any such "coin protection fund" would instantly crash the market if liquidated for use.\n\nThere are at most four altcoins which are (probably) not scams and have enough community activity to survive.
