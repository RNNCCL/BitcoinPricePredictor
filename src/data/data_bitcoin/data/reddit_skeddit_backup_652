In 2014 it lost more than half of its value against the dollar, beating even Ukraine\xe2\x80\x99s hryvnia and the Russian rouble. But measured by the number of new books it has inspired, bitcoin is top of the pile. Nearly 200 titles about the crypto-currency came out last year, according to Amazon. Another dozen will hit the shelves in the coming months.\n\nBe warned, though, some are pretty bad. Brian Kelly, an investment manager and talking head on CNBC, takes several stabs in \xe2\x80\x9cThe Bitcoin Big Bang\xe2\x80\x9d at explaining how the crypto-currency works, only to confuse the reader with his odd metaphors: \xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s call the first bitcoin a socialite named Genesis.\xe2\x80\x9d Dominic Frisby is a comedian and a financial writer who in an earlier book outed himself as an anarcho-capitalist. In \xe2\x80\x9cBitcoin: The Future of Money?\xe2\x80\x9d he suggests that bitcoin will change the world as we know it because governments will be unable to raise money for long wars if the currency is widely adopted. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is a force for peace,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr Frisby insists.\nFor any book on bitcoin to be worth reading, though, it has to delve further: into the crypto-currency\xe2\x80\x99s ideological and technical roots, for instance, or what it adds to the narrative of money, or even what its economic and political impact may be. The currency\xe2\x80\x99s dollar price may be three-quarters down on its peak, but the underlying technology also provides plenty of intellectual fodder\xe2\x80\x94and is unlikely to go away. So there is plenty to write about if you are serious.\nPaul Vigna and Michael Casey, two journalists at the Wall Street Journal, are certainly serious. In their new book, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Age of Cryptocurrency\xe2\x80\x9d, they don\xe2\x80\x99t waste time projecting millenarian political beliefs or searching for bitcoin\xe2\x80\x99s elusive creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, though they argue that the crypto-currency\xe2\x80\x99s quasi-religious \xe2\x80\x9ccreation myth\xe2\x80\x9d has been an important factor in creating a community around the project. Before he went offline in 2011 without leaving much of a trail, Mr Nakamoto had cleverly combined ideas developed by others with his main invention: the \xe2\x80\x9cblockchain\xe2\x80\x9d, a public ledger of all bitcoin transactions. The blockchain lives on the system\xe2\x80\x99s global network and is maintained and protected by \xe2\x80\x9cminers\xe2\x80\x9d, operators of specialised computers who are rewarded with bitcoin for their efforts.\nRather than begin their book with a breathless account of how bitcoin could change everything, Messrs Vigna and Casey start with a brief account of the centuries-old debate about the nature of money. The \xe2\x80\x9cmetallist\xe2\x80\x9d school sees money as a commodity, a thing with its own inherent value\xe2\x80\x94which governments should leave alone as much as possible. By contrast, \xe2\x80\x9cchartalists\xe2\x80\x9d view money as a complex system of credit relationships, which allows value to flow within a society. For these people currency is just the token around which the monetary system is arranged. And governments have a role to play in managing this system and thus the economy.\nThis philosophical division is also present in the debate about bitcoin. Libertarians treat it as a scarce commodity that needs to be \xe2\x80\x9cmined\xe2\x80\x9d (to create bitcoin and maintain the blockchain, miners solve mathematical puzzles, meaning that bitcoin is willed into existence by burning energy\xe2\x80\x94see article). But for a growing number of geeks and venture capitalists bitcoin is less a currency than a technology that can be used to transfer money and other assets cheaply and securely.\nMessrs Vigna and Casey predict that bitcoin\xe2\x80\x99s main calling will indeed be as a disruptive payment system. Before the crypto-currency, societies had to rely on banks and other centralised institutions to keep track of payments and guarantee the financial system. This position as gatekeeper has allowed these institutions to capture much economic rent. The blockchain technology cuts away the middlemen by taking over the role of ledger-keeping. \xe2\x80\x9cAt its core, crypto-currency is not about the ups and downs of the digital currency market,\xe2\x80\x9d the authors write, but \xe2\x80\x9cabout freeing people from the tyranny of centralised trust.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThe book is at its liveliest when it discusses the potential impact of bitcoin. The currency may not be a must-use in rich countries with well-developed payment services, but it could help the poor world\xe2\x80\x99s 2.5 billion unbanked to connect to the formal financial system (the book opens with the story of an Afghan woman who gets paid in bitcoin for the articles she writes for an American website). What is more, because no one controls the blockchain it has already become the foundation (\xe2\x80\x9cplatform\xe2\x80\x9d in the parlance) for a growing number of start-ups. And the technology may also undermine other centralised institutions in the \xe2\x80\x9ctrust business\xe2\x80\x9d, such as stockmarkets, or give the sharing economy a boost (some have speculated that in future taxis may be not only self-driving, but self-owned\xe2\x80\x94meaning they are effectively owned by the blockchain).\nWisely Messrs Vigna and Casey do not predict that this will happen overnight, or that the technology is a panacea. Bitcoin and other crypto-currencies will continue to grow, they write, not alongside the offline world, but attached to it, with institutions and businesses adopting it to suit their needs.

Often in software engineering the hardest problem is that "right" is not well defined-- but for a mathematically defined system, right can often be much more clear cut. One thing we do is reason from the mathematical description, we can apply algebra to infer other things about what we\'re computing: E.g. for integers A,B, C if we\'re computing C = A + B then we also know that C must be greater than or equal to A and B; and we can review and test for this truth to hold. (Of course, this requires a fair degree of understanding of what we\'re actually implementing.)\n\nFor some kinds for functions (polynomal functions) their behavior can be completely comparison tested by testing them at a \'relatively\' small number of values because no two different non-trivial polynomial functions can be the same at more than a number of points determined by the order of the function without actually being the same function.

You might find a presentation on some of the work I did on another project informative: https://www.ietf.org/proceedings/82/slides/codec-4.pdf\n\nYou can test for unknown bugs by testing for criteria which must hold true universally, and then testing on inputs constructed to trigger bugs abstractly, which is precisely what we did here. Single components can also sometimes be tested for unknown issues by exhausting all possible cases (again, with invariants and/or alternative implementations to establish the ground truth). You also aren't limited on testing invariants on the outputs, about 7% of libsecp256k1's lines of code are test instrumentation which check invariants inside functions.\n\nWere this not so, you wouldn't see this OpenSSL CVE, since we found it by applying the same tests to OpenSSL as libsecp256k1. (Testing can also find the problem with a single implementation because they also tested the agreement of a plain multiply-a-number-with-itself with the optimized squaring operation-- an example of a universally true invariant: x*x == x^2 for all x).\n\nThen there are tools like whitebox fuzzing, where the execution of the tested software is monitored and the system searches for test inputs that exercise more of the software's functionality. \n\nTesting approaches do not replace review, careful conservative construction, or formal proof. They are necessary, but not sufficient. They do, however increase confidence and provide clear evidence of a useful process.\n\nTesting can be relatively inexpensive for the amount of reliability it provides-- even extensive, thoughtfully constructed tests--, and well constructed tests can also help compensate for fundamental weaknesses in review and formal proof (which both suffer from perception biases, since proof criteria or review are all conducted by humans who may make errors in common).\n\n> I'm also curious why Peter Dettman isn't mentioned here.\n\nBecause the page is thanking outside contributors.

We wouldn\'t be doing it if we didn\'t consider it important.\n\nBitcoin core has particular consistency requirements which are basically unique due to Bitcoin being a cryptographic consensus system. What would be a ordinary "bugfix" in normal crypto library  is potentially a fatal bug-introduction for Bitcoin.  It\'s unreasonable for us to expect random software to meet our determinism demands. (for example, if this broken squaring operation were used in pubkey decompression _fixing_ it in an uncontrolled manner would expose the network to a risk of an attacker triggered consensus fork: Not just hypothetically, I created an exploit; it just doesn\'t work because of a missed optimization in OpenSSL).\n\nBy specializing on just our needs we\'re also able to achieve much higher performance, and that performance can turn around and be used to improve decentralization or add security in other ways (e.g. constant time signing).\n\nWe\'re also targeting a higher level of publicly visible correctness assurance than we\'ve generally seen elsewhere, hopefully one that doesn\'t at all depend on "authored by super diligent folks", because even super diligent folks make mistakes (see also the supercop/ed25519 having a similar carry bug). Some of this is just planned and not materialized yet, because the library is still a work-in-progress.\n\nIt\'s hard to express this succinctly for someone not involved in it. Maybe some numbers will help,  in the libsecp256k1 codebase 22% of the lines of code are tests. 7% of the lines of code are assertions (sanity checks run during testing to increase the testing power). 8% of the code-- some of the gnarly parts comparable to the part that was broken in OpenSSL-- comes along with manually verifiable proofs of correctness and somewhat more of the code have been machine proven to be free of some classes of error. In the last two months I\'ve probably put in over 20,000 cpu hours of testing on random and quasi-random test cases myself. We\'ve had at least 5 contributors who\'ve reviewed (parts of) the system closely enough to spot problems, many crypto software projects are just one or two person shows.  I\'m sure you can say cumulatively that something like OpenSSL has had much more work poured into it, but this is work that has all been very focused because the library does just a few things and not thousands of things; and we\'re planning on doing more of it: We don\'t yet think it\'s well tested enough to use in Bitcoin core except for signing.\n\n\n\n': 26, 'This post is by nullc so reading is yes.': 10, 'hero': 2, 'You heroes who do work on the core code deserve more than I can give!': 7, "That code may be too slow for the non-static parts of our test to be very effective, as seems to be doing all operations with affine coordinates. Though it appears to be focused on signing and signing is less critical because it can be validated and (in the case of Bitcoin applications) is validated before transmission (and I suppose the host not the device is doing most of the pubkey generation).\n\nIndependent of the testing, the code you linked to appears to be have a very large timing and power sidechannel-- e.g. timing alone should directly read out the hamming weight of the DSA nonce, even worse than OpenSSL.

If things must be done multiple times, then it\'s more costly to run. I think, generally, our security is more limited by decentralization than conventional crypto or software issues.  This is why performance is at all interesting to use for libsecp256k1: more performance means more decentralization, it also means we can have things like protection against timing attacks without making it unacceptably slow.\n\n': 19, "I basically responded to this at http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/2rrxq7/on_why_010s_release_notes_say_we_have_reason_to/cnitbz3\n\nAlso, the main thrust of this post is that the test in the replacement found bugs in OpenSSL is a good indicator.

Then I had a good teacher and thought I could at least manage math. Then I hit number theory for a cryptography course and I realized I don\'t understand anything.).\n\nJust because something is open source doesn\'t mean it\'s going to get a thorough and adequate review, which is nullc\'s point.\n\nThis needs to be understood so that the public will demand this and support developers who can do this. People need to be aware that there\'s significant effort required in this and a significant opportunity cost in not doing something else which will just pay them directly.\n\nI\'m being hypocritical in writing this rather than going and donating but I just wanted to tack on here to re-emphasize the point: review should not be taken for granted. "Open source" is not magic. If you don\'t know who the developers are, what they have done, what they think the current weaknesses are, etc., then you don\'t know how reliable the code is.\n\nThe is one of the major things that kept me out of bitcoin for years; I kept meaning to try to really read and understand the whitepaper thoroughly (still not done) and I kept meaning to read the code (still not done). And I knew that even with that, I wouldn\'t be able to fully understand the code, in particular because of the cryptography, and have assurance from my own knowledge that it was correct. So I just have to trust "it\'s worked so far; it\'ll probably keep working", but this is an argument from ignorance. The truth is, the more bitcoin grows, the more incentive there will be to find a vulnerability in it. And even if all of the math is entirely correct, the smallest quirk in implementation along the way can allow for vulnerabilities.\n\nSo we must remain vigilant and support our developers as best we can. We must prioritize technical correctness even at the cost occasionally of slower development otherwise or slightly lagging UX. We must make sure that the constant stories of "bitcoin got hacked" do not become accurate.\n\nBecause that has always been and still remains the greatest threat to the system in my opinion.

This is what OpenSSL does, and at least when also faced with a cache flush probing it _still_ managed to leak keys with a few hundred signatures (https://eprint.iacr.org/2014/161.pdf).

Smartcard vendors implement their own cryptography with full visibility into the hardware at the transistor level and below in order to gain robustness there.

These payments are **signed** to show the world that they are authentic, and **signatures** have a unique *secret key* that prevents others from copying them.\n\nThe wallet program tells the computer how to do these signatures. Nowadays, wallets use a general code (**openSSL**) for this. The openSSL makes a lot of tasks (other than signing bitcoin transactions); in fact it is used almost everywhere on the internet. This is good and bad. It is good because it means that a lot of smart people are watching the code and making sure that its **signatures** cannot leak the *secret key*. But it is bad, because some specific risks and flaws get diluted among the huge set of features, and sometimes these specific features are very important for Bitcoin.\n\nThat is why /u/nullc and other Bitcoin developers are creating a new program that does these **signatures**, but only in the specific way used in Bitcoin. The tradeoff is that less smart people will be watching the code, but the good part is that concentrating on the Bitcoin specifics leaves less vulnerabilities (risks) of leaking the *secret key*, which is what we ultimately want.': 2, "Of course not, it's a mailing list! https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/ietf-smtp\n": 12, "I should clarify that I mean that patching Dogecoin to bring it in line with 0.10 is being worked on, and libsecp256k1 is therefore part of that.

It\'s composed of lots of different miners with different values, any of whom could leave the mining pool at any time, at no cost.\n\nSecond, aligning economic incentives matter more than sheer numbers. Having lots of different parties doesn\'t matter, if they all disagree with you (for example on the issue of "should bitcoin be 51% attacked").  If you answer "no" and all miners answer "no", and won\'t change their mind, then you are safe even if there\'s only 2 miners. Conversely, if you answer "no" and 51% of them answer "yes", you\'re screwed no matter how many of them there are. In reality people do change their minds. But having more parties involved does not necessarily mean it\'s less likely a majority of them will change their minds. If collusion becomes economical, then collusion could happen on any scale.': 6, '[deleted]': 2, 'True.': 1, 'How can you say PoS is decentralized with a straight face?': 4, "Bitcoin only has checkpoints as an anti-DOS measure, so of course we don't mind.

If the miner has a large stake of BTC, they might be economically motivated to not attack the network, but the same can be said for a PoS system. In fact with a (non-delegated) PoS system that is even more true since you need to have large stake in the system to produce blocks in the first place.\n\nBut the miner may not have any stake in BTC (they could sell all of their BTC for fiat as they mine it). In that case, they are only economically motivated to not attack the network (or rather not allow the network to come under attack) because they want job security. They want to make sure there still is a valuable network on which they can mine. But the same can be said for the delegates in DPOS. They are earning good money producing blocks and they do not want to ruin the network because then they would be out of a job.\n\nSo despite miners voluntary leaving THE largest mining pool to one of the other large mining pools, I don't think the vast majority of miners are altruistic enough to refuse to participate in the top 10 largest mining pools for the sake of decentralization.

If this assumption is wrong feel free to correct me.  Many people believe the free market doesn\'t lead to optimal outcomes based on historical (and present-day) evidence.  You mentioned healthcare so I will use it as an example, but this argument applies to the existence of profit incentives in all the systems you mentioned due to fundamental contradictions between profitability and the services provided.\n\n\nWhile having healthcare not controlled by a single group of people is indeed a rationally noble goal, until we see a system presented able to do so it\'s merely a pipe dream.  The free market is not a one-size-fits-all solution to these problems.  For example, I strongly disagree with for-profit health insurance.  And I do not believe the market is an efficient or effective way to realize not-for-profit health insurance in the absence of regulation or external intervention.\n\n\n\nIf someone creates a fair system for not-for-profit health insurance where payouts are demonstrably need-based and pay-ins are equal for all, I would support such a system.  I do not believe the market is capable of creating one due to the fact that it is more profitable/"rational" to let someone die than not if you expect them to cost more than they input. Not to mention that it is profitable to use insurance pools to speculate, as health insurance companies like Aetna and United currently do (in billions of real-estate, stock and bond investments, etc.)  And thus our only shot at such a system is currently having a public option.  Note that this still doesn\'t mean healthcare is controlled by the government, merely that the government is a participant in the ecosystem, competing and integrating with private industry to provide a service that corrects a market failure.  This is contrary to money, where one government group that is not even fully accountable to any elected government (the Federal Reserve) wholly owns and decides all monetary policy for the entire world.\n\n\nBitcoin on the other hand is the world\'s first not-for-profit monetary system - while its participants profit according to their participation, this profit is entirely transparent and accountable.  There is no central controlling entity able to make decisions for the entirety of the Bitcoin network drawing a profit, and the core development of the protocol  proceeds according to the wishes of the majority of its stakeholders democratically (through updates).  Miners profit not *because they control the Bitcoin network* but *because they provide services to the Bitcoin network\'s users*.    When such a system is presented approaching the challenges of healthcare, I will support it wholeheartedly.
