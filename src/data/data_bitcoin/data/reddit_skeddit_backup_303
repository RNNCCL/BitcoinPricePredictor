Even the fee market concept fails to prevent this. Individuals can not simply increase their fees to any level - a government attacker can, and so a government can just keep forcing the other users transactions out of service. A government attack, could destroy the utility of the system for a sustained period - that would probably kill it.\n\nFortunately, it appears that governments either do not see Bitcoin as a threat, or see an opportunity to co-opt it for a cashless society - with strong tracking and hence taxation advantages to them. Many well connected people are also now understanding the genuine advantages that the blockchain technology can deliver to moribund but essential parts of our finance system. \n\nSo there is also an incentive to generate a supportive view of all things blockchain - and that indirectly includes Bitcoin. You have probably noticed the shift in the propaganda slant in this direction in the MSM.\n\nIt means that even if volume growth forces the gradual centralisation of the validating and mining nodes, Bitcoin will still remain viable (useful to governments, hence supported, or at least ignored, by them) - and for the libertarian minority in the world, there will always be privacy solutions layered around the Bitcoin network.\n': 1, 'Your proposal is simple, but it\'s not flexible enough.

If we cannot scale quickly enough to handle massive adoption, we miss our moment.\n\nFacebook went from a few million users to a billion users in a relatively short period of time.  If they had massively failed to support that sudden growth, they would have never achieved their current dominance.\n\nI therefore propose a solution that is simple, flexible, and can scale quickly.  Each miner "votes" in each block on the next max blocksize value.  At each difficulty adjustment (roughly every two weeks) the median of all votes during the prior period becomes the new max blocksize.\n\nYour proposal also does not distinguish between spam and adoption.\n\nUnder my scheme, if some country announces that they\'re adoption bitcoin as their national currency, the miners can make sure we\'re ready for the sudden growth.  But if the transaction load is just fee-free spam, the miners would not have an incentive to grow the blocksize to support it.': 1}, ('Princeton University is offering a course on Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Technologies on Coursera.

For example, a currently popular view of proposition bets, the "prediction markets" view, often treats prop bets or idea futures as purely information-distribution mechanisms, with the only incentives supposed as the benign incentive to profit by adding useful information to the market. This fails to take into account the incentives such markets create to act differently outside the market.  A "prediction market" is always also one that changes incentives outside that market: a prediction market automatically creates parallel incentives to bring about the predicted event. For example a prediction market on a certain person\'s death is also an assassination market. Which is why a pre-Gulf-War-II DARPA-sponsored experimental "prediction market" included a prop bet on Saddam Hussein\'s death, but excluded such trading on any other, more politically correct world leaders. A sufficiently large market predicting an individual\'s death is also, necessarily, an assassination market, and similarly other "prediction" markets are also act markets, changing incentives to act outside that market to bring about the predicted events."

Migrating from GLBSE to other exchanges was a major PITA.\n4. 2012: Several smaller exchanges e.g. Litecoin Global / BTCT / BitFunder appeared and hosted assets migrated from GLBSE. At that point people understood an importance of having some sort of an independent owner registry which can be used for painless migration. Companies listed are mostly mining operations, mining equipment manufacturers, but also some startups not all of them are Bitcoin-related.

In both cases the companies were actually registered and there was some linkage between actual equity and equity on these exchanges. Also some companies, e.g. ASICMINER, demonstrated the viability of the concept by paying significant dividends to investors.\n6. 2013: The first token crowdsale: Mastercoin.\n7. 2014: Collapse of previously promising IPOs: CoinTerra went bankrupt, NEO&BEE turned out to be a scam.

So if we get back 5,000 responses, we generate 5,000 blockchain receipts and anchor them into the blockchain with a single transaction. Here's how it works:\n\n* We generate a hash of every record submitted to Tierion.\n* We place these hashes into a queue.\n* Every ten minutes, we construct a Merkle tree of these hashes, publish the root in a Bitcoin transaction, and generate a blockchain receipt for every item in the tree.\n\nEach blockchain receipt contains all the information needed to verify the timestamp and contents of the record. This allows us to secure millions of records in the blockchain with a single hash. Otherwise we'd be limited to Bitcoin's current seven transaction per second limit.\n\nBlockchain receipts are portable.  Other systems can verify the data by looking up the Merkle Root in OP_Return of a specified bitcoin transaction and using math to validate the receipt. There is no dependency on the system that generates the blockchain receipt.\n\nNo altcoin is needed.\n\nWe've created a standard protocol called [Chainpoint](http://tierion.com/chainpoint) for recording data in the blockchain and generating blockchain receipts.

We can see very quickly who is wagging who.': 1, 'This is *technically* incorrect, which makes it one of the more questionable choices of the BIP.

The likelihood of certain attacks drop because we have criminal justice systems. \n\nFor instance, we have 2 bugs in bitcoin.

It can be between two coinwallet employees then. You also don\'t seem to realize that intent is not everything especially regarding UK law.\n\nI can intentionally be a dick and drive everywhere at 25 MPH, however there is no law against it regardless of the queues that might build up. I can openly state my intent is to back up traffic but it doesn\'t matter because THE LAW HAS NOT BEEN BROKEN.\n\nJust like in this case.

Intent is mostly irrelevant until it gets to court.\n\nLike i have said elsewhere if i setup a webserver on some ancient kit but have an I.P logger attached and it falls over you can\'t go after people for just visiting.\n\nIf they were malforming transactions or doing something to circumvent controls then you might have a case. It is completely irrelevant what the white paper says because for there to be a criminal case to answer in the UK some entity needs to have been harmed. The bitcoin network as a whole can not be used, OP could try for disruption to his business but again that would be very shakey ground and would likely have to go to a civil case.\n\nYou can\'t argue because they are not spending on goods and services one minute then get all excited when people use bitcoins blockchain for storing information on diamonds etc. Luke-Jr\'s storage of bible verses is enough to get it tossed out on that technicality.\n\nI honestly don\'t know where you are from but I am guessing U.S?

Anyhow if you think a crime has been commited feel free to phone the UK police. Given it is a criminal offense it will require police action first to gather the information and then hand over to CPS who will decide if it is in the interests of the people to prosecute further. It won\'t cost someone in the UK anything except time so maybe one person spouting about how unfair it is in this sub should ring through to the police.\n\nOf course they won\'t though because just like anything bitcoin a tiny number of people do something (like yourself) and everyone else sits on the sidelines alternating between hype and claiming oppression.\n\nAny other financial would have adapted after the first "stress test" by not doing so under UK law you also risk the case getting thrown out.

There exist many attacks that have no good solution to them. DoSing the system out of capacity is one of them. All possible outcomes are bad, the absolute best that can be achieved is failing in a slightly less bad way.\n\n> Once we start replacing this armor by "law and order" we have already lost, since a real criminal would not care about the law\n\nReal criminals very much care about the law, when it catches up with them.\n\nLook, every financial system in existence relies on a combination of defence and attack. Defence: security systems to make criminals lives hard. And attack for when those defences are occasionally breached, to set expectations.\n\nWhen attacks are free you will eventually lose because no defence system is perfect, nor can it be without making something so hard to use nobody wants it.

Even if they're paying for it, you could argue that if a large enough percentage of miners are stealing theirs - they are vicariously liable or accomplices in a crime? You'd have to find a utility company or landlord who'd be willing to press criminal charges and/or sue based on that theory - and worse, you'd drag down miners with you.\n\nIf you want to keep examples uncontrived and confined to TCP/IP traffic, arguing that Coinwallet is breaking the law here would be like me saying that CNN is liable *to me* for the Scientology website exceeding its bandwidth after breaking the Tom Cruise video and *paying Scientology for both the video and the privilege of linking to Scientology.org*. In reality they didn't pay for it, of course, because this idea of Coinwallet breaking the law is more contrived than any of the previous examples.\n\nOr for another example, consider a sort of call-in music show on TV where you can vote for the next song by SMS (costing a few satoshis).

Heck, even at 10 minutes you see blocks mined with no transactions because it takes a few seconds to verify the previous block and issue new work to miners.\n\nAll of this for what? You get faster confirmation times, but confirmation is already plenty fast. It's orders of magnitude faster than credit card transactions become irreversible. And this doesn't solve any of the debate either. You still have to decide how much faster the blockchain's size can increase, when the block time changes, how much of a consensus you need for the new rules to go into effect, who decides when the time changes, and so on.\n\nI don't mean to be excessively negative, but I don't see enough of a positive to this idea to offset the negatives of it.

There are many many transactions per block.": 2}, ('Bitcoin network stress test to be held next week', 1): {}}}
