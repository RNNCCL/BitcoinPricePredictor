At least now we have choice. ': 2, ">#1 KEEP YOUR COMPUTER SECURE\n\n>Having a clean operating system is the foundation of good security. The majority of hacks that I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen tend to target Window\xe2\x80\x99s users and it has the most viruses in the wild. Anti-viruses aren\xe2\x80\x99t always 100% effective and they can slow down your computer. That said, it\xe2\x80\x99s better to run one than to not run one.\n\n>Many people use Windows because it offers a wider selection of programs. If you do decide to use it, perhaps have a dedicated computer exclusively for crypto. If you\xe2\x80\x99re surfing the internet with a Window\xe2\x80\x99s computer then you should keep your crypto related activity separate. Macs tend to be more secure and Linux is considers to be the best option. This is the main reason why most servers in the world run on the Linux operating system.\n\n>#2: UPDATE YOUR COMPUTER REGULARLY\n\n>Updates often fix bugs and security vulnerabilities so it\xe2\x80\x99s important to run them as often as possible. Open-source software tends to have frequent updates because there are more eyes auditing the code. People sometimes procrastinate updating their computers which leaves them susceptible to hackers. When vulnerabilities become known, many hackers will create viruses to exploit them.\n\n>#3: USE STRONG PASSWORDS\n\n>Brute force cracking is the most common way for thieves to get access to your account. People often make the mistake of using really simple passwords like \xe2\x80\x9cMickeymouse123\xe2\x80\x9d. Another common mistake is to use the same password on multiple accounts.\n\n>The best passwords are at least 16 characters long with a combination of numbers, letters, capitals and symbols. If you find this too difficult to remember then perhaps use a sentence that\xe2\x80\x99s at least 20 characters long.\n\n>#4: USE TWO-FACTOR AUTHENTICATION\n\n>In the event that your password gets cracked, 2FA will still prevent the hacker from accessing your account. This is an additional level of security that generates a secondary password from a phone app or text message. Not only does the attacker need to steal your password, they also need physical access to your phone.\n\n>Two-factor authentication is an absolute must for using cryptocurrency exchanges. You may also want to consider using it for your primary email address as well as any websites that you own.\n\n>#5: DOUBLE CHECK ALL URLS\n\n>You can have to most air tight security in the world but if you send your coins to a fake website you\xe2\x80\x99ll lose your money. There are many fake websites that mimic genuine crypto sites yet they change one letter of the domain name in order to trick people. You want to always double check the url and never send money to a site that\xe2\x80\x99s not encrypted with https.\n\n>#6: DOUBLE CHECK THE CRYPTO ADDRESS\n\n>When you\xe2\x80\x99re sending bitcoins to somebody it\xe2\x80\x99s always important to double check the address. Human error is also a common mistake and crypto transactions are irreversible. There are also some new crafty viruses that change the address on you when you copy and paste it into your wallet. There\xe2\x80\x99s even a nasty chrome extension that changes the QR code in your browser. \n\n>#7: USE A HARDWARE WALLET\n\n>Bitcoin has great hardware wallets like Trezor, which provides the security of cold storage with the simplicity of a hot wallet. Cold storage is considered the best practice for keeping your private keys secure but can sometimes be time consuming to implement.\n\n>Paper wallets aren\xe2\x80\x99t reusable and can be vulnerable when swiping the keys into another wallet. Hardware wallets may be the perfect tool to help boost mainstream user adoption because they\xe2\x80\x99re safe and convenient to use. \n\n>#8: BE CAREFUL OF COUNTERPARTY RISK\n\n>Bitcoin traders need to use exchanges in order to make money in the markets. Crypto exchanges have a history of losing or stealing people\xe2\x80\x99s coins so they actually pose one of the biggest risks. If you are an active trader then there are a few things you can do to reduce the risk. \n\n>Don\xe2\x80\x99t keep coins on an exchange when you\xe2\x80\x99re not actively trading\n>Only use 20-30% of your coins for trading\n>Diversify your coins amongst several exchanges\n>Always research the exchange to make sure it\xe2\x80\x99s in good standing with the crypto community\n>#9: BE CAREFUL WITH DOWNLOADING TOO MANY WALLETS\n\n>There are new altcoins being released every week and it\xe2\x80\x99s not always possible to audit the code for security vulnerabilities. Some of these wallets may contain malware that can steal private keys form other wallets. The more wallets you download on a computer the greater the chances are of getting a trojan horse. \n\n>#10: BACKUP YOUR PRIVATE KEYS\n\n>Too many people have lost money as a result of forgetting to backup their private keys. If you\xe2\x80\x99re running a core wallet then save regular backups stored on a usb key.\n\n>Some wallets like Electrum and Trezor can generate a 13 or 24 word seed that can restore all your addresses. Make sure to write these down somewhere safe and do not keep a digital record of them.\n\n>#11: USE DIFFERENT ADDRESSES FOR EACH TRANSACTION\n\n>Blockchains are pseudonymous but your transactions can still be seen on the public ledger. To increase your privacy you may want to consider generating a new address every time you receive coins. This will help obfuscate your transactions on the network.\n\n>#12: ONLY USE PHONE OR WEB WALLETS FOR PETTY CASH\n\n>Phones and web wallets tend to be less secure than core wallets and cold storage. Many phones have vulnerabilities due to app permissions and web wallets tend to store your private keys in your browser. It\xe2\x80\x99s much easier to steal private keys from a phone or browser than it is from encrypted core software or cold storage. Consider your phone like petty cash that should be spent on smaller transactions as you go about your day.\n\n...and it's just that simple!!\n\nSeriously I just have my dirty statist fiat direct deposited into my bank account and I never have to think about securing it, and that's true whether I'm holding it or trying to send it somewhere else.

Is this a preference or a necessity?\n\n>What attracted me to bitcoin is having a decentralized alternative that can actually send payments more efficiently. \n\nIt seems to me like you've got a pretty tough row to hoe if you're going to make the case that Bitcoin is more efficient than fiat.  Bitcoin is *horrendously* inefficient; it can only manage 3-or-so transactions per second, it's scraping up against that cap, and everybody's been wringing their hands for *years* about how to fix it.  Visa handles [about 6,400 transactions per *second*](http://financialcryptography.com/mt/archives/000547.html), and it's not even at capacity; that's just as many transactions are there currently are for Visa to handle.  That is literally a difference of orders of magnitude.\n\nBitcoin is decentralized, sure, but efficient it is not.": 2, ">Have we learned nothing from history?\n\nWe have; that's why deposit insurance exists, it's a big part of why the federal reserve exists (to be a lender of last resort to banks experiencing a run), and it's why financial regulation exists.

Your assets can be levied at any time. \n\nWith bitcoin you can send a million dollars instantly to anyone for 10 cents. Show me any option in the legacy system that does this faster, cheaper and without friction.
