Because money in the legacy system is created through lending, obviously bitcoin doesn\'t fit well into that paradigm. He then makes the mistake that many people make where it is assumed that bitcoin represents a devolution back to the monetary paradigm that predates modern banking, whereas the opposite is the truth: bitcoin represents an evolution up from modern banking, a new paradigm. \n\nDouble entry record keeping is not the paradigm Bitcoin and blockchain needs to replicate, it is the paradigm that is being replaced by this new technology. In short, the blockchain is as great an advance in monetary history as double entry book keeping itself was. \n\nDouble entry is ultimately a system for reducing the risk of accounting errors that are possible since each accounting entity is responsible for their own bookkeeping. Indeed, the modern banking system derives out of the fact that every accounting entity is disconnected from the next and therefore turns trust into the fundamental "commodity," as it were, underlying the financial system. You can know if your own sheet is balanced, you cannot know that of your peers. This is ultimately the root of the concept of creditworthiness. \n\nBecause everyone\'s accounts remain separate and each accounting entity must to some degree trust the next, the most trustworthy accounting entity\'s credit become the base money of a society. This entity is usually the government. \n\nCentral banks must keep their own balance sheet to maintain the value of the currency. This value does not derive from the currency being "backed" by anything. Most central bank credit is backed by government debt. Government debt, on the other hand, is only repayable in central bank credit. So ultimately the base currency is not backed by anything. But that is not to say that the purpose of the central bank\'s balance sheet to promote confidence like some sort of cheap parlor trick. \n\nThe purpose is to control the money supply. Since each credit (money) has to be balanced with a debit (government debt), the amount of currency cannot theoretically exceed the amount of debt created by the government. Likewise with regard to money created by commercial banks which is created through lending. The amount of money created cannot exceed the debt of borrowers. \n\nPut simply, without the balance sheet money would very quickly become worthless. But this is only in a system where money is bank credit. All money needs in order to be valuable is to be useful (i.e., for payments and liquidity) and to be scarce. The only reason the current system uses bank credit as the form of money is because banks are required to use money in the legacy system, for storing it, receiving it, and spending it. \n\nThis need for banks to store, spend, and receive money all derive from the fact that each financial entity is disconnected and dependent on their own balance sheet with no guarantee that their peer is creditworthy. Therefore we must collectively utilize trusted third parties to facilitate the use of money. Furthermore, since digital transfer of money in a system of independent accounting entities has only been possible through the sending of IOUs, this system would be entirely impossible without trusted middlemen. \n\nBecause banks are required to use legacy money, money creation takes place through bank lending. Naturally this has given rise to many economic theories that wrongly assume bank lending is intrinsic to money creation and economically necessary. The reality is that is only true in a system where there is no global shared ledger and entity\'s of trust are required middlemen to bridge the chasm between everyone\'s independent accounts. \n\nBecause banks create money through lending, and lending is how banks make money, if money wasn\'t destroyed upon loan repayment the supply of money would not remain stable. You can\'t have banks simply creating more and more money without the old money offsetting this process by being destroyed. But that does not mean that money intrinsically requires this property of coming in and out of existence. That is only required in a monetary system in which lending is the means of creating money. Ultimately, all that is required is that the supply remain stable. \n\nWhat a blockchain represents is the possibility that everyone can share the same ledger and that therefore the need to balance ones own books is no longer necessary. Cryptographic proof guarantees that each accounting entity\'s books add up and are visible for everyone else to see. There is no need for double entry because there is no possibility of accounting errors. \n\nThe value of a currency in a blockchain, like bitcoin, derives from the same place any currency\'s value derives from: its utility and limited supply. Since the supply of Bitcoin is mathematically guaranteed, the idea that the currency needs to be backed by something that limits that supply disappears. The need for the money to be created via the process of exchange for something else of value still applies to maintain the underlying economics of the system (i.e., if mining was free everyone would do it and the value of the currency would drop), but ultimately currency creation will cease and the miners, who are really facilitating the transactions, much as modern banks do, will simply be paid via fees. Since the money supply will be stable and money creation will cease, there will be no corresponding need to destroy money in order to keep the supply stable and the value intact the way there is in the legacy system. \n\nThis creates the fear of something looking a lot like the gold standard. That view misunderstands how blockchains, and in particular Bitcoin, work. Money creation in a Bitcoin monetary system will not happen through the creation of new bitcoins, nor will it happen through the lending of credit backed by bitcoins. Money creation will happen through the issuance of independent monetary tokens that will be issued on top of the bitcoin blockchain. These tokens will inherent all of the properties and security of bitcoin and anyone will be able to use, store, spend, and receive them as easily as they use bitcoin, but these tokens will be independently controlled and issued by whatever financial entity chooses to create them.\n\nThat is to say, a public blockchain like Bitcoin allows anyone to create money. Since this power will no longer be exclusive to banks, and the need for banks to store, receive, and spend digital payments disappears, any business or community can, in theory, create their own independent money systems to finance themselves and lend money. These monies will be easily traded for other tokens, including bitcoin. \n\nBecause of the proliferation of tokens which will have variable use, the value of those tokens will always fluctuate with respect to the rest of the economic ecosystem. If your business grants advantages to users who use your token, then the value of that token will depend on how successful your business is. Investing in the token will be a form of investment in the company. The distinction between equity and money will blur as anyone\'s equity can trade with as much liquidity as base money. \n\nAll of this is just to give a sense of how blockchain technology is most definitely not just a return to some kind of digital gold standard, and over the coming decades will prove to be a dramatic shift in monetary history. Yes, the supply of Bitcoin is fixed, but we are not talking about a national currency here, we are talking about a new global monetary order. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n': 1, "He's trying to compare Bitcoin to a bank.  Bitcoin is not a bank or a company and is not meant to approximate one.\n\n>The consequence is that Bitcoin appears to be a claim on nothing at all. \n\nA bitcoin is indeed a claim on nothing at all, in the exact same way that a silver coin is a claim on nothing at all.  The silver is valuable because the physical properties that it has cause people to agree that it is useful as physical money.   Bitcoin is valuable because the mathematical properties that it has cause people to agree that it is useful as digital money.   Bitcoin is independently mathematically (cryptographically) verifiable by anyone who wants to verify it.  Therefore bitcoins can be sent from any person in any country to any other person in any other country over the internet without requiring a trusted bank or company in the middle.  Because of this, people value bitcoins.  A bitcoin is not a claim something else.

Craig Wright took the Bitcoins that he had mined offshore. At the time, it\nwas worth 3-4 cents. The total value of this was around $5000. He then started up W&K Info\nDefense LLC (W&K) with Mr Dave Kleiman. W&K was an entity created for the purpose of\nmining Bitcoins. Craig Wright is a forensic computer expert. He is constantly updating himself\nattending courses, workshops and training sessions. He is also a university lecturer at Charles\nSturt University and conducts courses. He even provides services to some Australian\ngovernment agencies including the ATO and the Defence Force. However, this is all done on a\nvery high level.\n Craig Wright had mined a lot of Bitcoins. Craig then took the Bitcoins and put them into a\nSeychelles Trust. A bit of it was also put into Singapore. This was run out of an entity from the\nUK. Craig had gotten approximately 1.1 million Bitcoins. There was a point in time, when he had\naround 10% of all the Bitcoins out there. Mr Kleiman would have had a similar amount. However,\nMr Kleiman passed away during that time. He was a war veteran; he was wheel chair bound.\nThe deed between Craig Wright and W&K was created in 2012. W&K gave Craig Wrights rights\nto the Bitcoins and he has used the Bitcoins to do all this stuff.\nMr Kleiman and Craig Wright decided to start up W&K because they both wanted to get involved\nwith Bitcoins. They recognised that this industry was not regulated and they wanted to start up a\nregulated Bitcoin bank. They knew they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t do this in the US so they wanted to do this in\nAustralia.\n\n* Before engaging in Mark Ferrier\xe2\x80\x99s services, Craig Wright had\nconducted lots of checks on him and everything came up clean. So in essence, Craig Wright\nwanted the banking software and Mark Ferrier wanted Bitcoins.\nAround mid-July/August, Craig Wright released funds from an entity located in the UK to MJF\nConsulting. This was all going through a server located in Central West Africa.\nMark Ferrier was then arrested in September 2013.\n\n* AM: We should have all the documents already provided on our systems. I have a question to\nask. Were actual Bitcoins physically paid to MJF Consulting or Mark Ferrier?\nJC: Yes. We paid Bitcoins to him. We paid the Bitcoins to where he directed for the Bitcoins to\nbe paid into.\nAM: Just to confirm, was it actual physical Bitcoins that was paid?\nJC: Yes.\n\nEDIT:\nI titled this undisclosed because they never really seem to mention a figure for the transaction.
