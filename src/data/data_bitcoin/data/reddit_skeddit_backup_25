That is what zero percent interest rates means. The US "recovery" -- which is really just the massive inflation of asset prices -- has been the result.  \n\nFree money thus far has had the effect of concentrating wealth to the top of society. That is because the bankers and financial elites are the ones who get to borrow at near zero percent and use that money to invest in other things in order to make themselves even richer. When rich people are all collectively doing this you get a rise in the value of all the things rich people buy, e.g., stocks. \n\nSo you have a kind of ponzi-like situation in which everyone knows that the cheap money means asset values are guaranteed to keep inflating because everyone is borrowing and then using that borrowed money to invest more. Since everyone knows everyone else is doing this, they know the prices will keep going up, and since they know the prices will keep going up, they keep borrowing, and since borrowing is free there is no reason not to. \n\nSo all the value is being sucked out of society into this massive inflation of things rich people buy and then all the elites, living sheltered from the rest of society, declare the amazing job the Fed has done and the success of the economic recovery (which politicians like Obama are quick to embrace). Then they all scratch their heads wondering why Donald Trump is the Republican nominee and why Bernie Sanders almost defeated Clinton. \n\nWhat we have is a massive amount of inflation that is all concentrated around assets. Since these aren\'t measure by the inflation indices such as the CPI -- which focus on the prices of things consumed by middle income people -- the tendency to believe that the rise in asset values reflects an underlying strength in the economy, after all, that is generally how people view rising stock prices. \n\nThe reality, however, is that the legacy monetary system is being used to facilitate a massive wealth transfer from the poor and middle class to the wealthy, and then the media sells this wealth transfer by calling it the "economic recovery." \n\n': 4, "There isn't going to be the need for middle-men to connect lenders to borrowers. The peer-to-peer revolution will, with time, obviate that need. Even investing in companies won't require third parties, as the stock will exist on the blockchain and dividends will be paid directly through the stock to its corresponding bitcoin address (or whichever base currency the stock token is issued on). \n\nThis vision of connecting lenders-to-borrowers is actually profoundly promising for society. I think today's situation is one where the bankers are the primary lenders, there really isn't the peer-to-peer situation people imagine there being. \n\nPeople imagine that most citizens lend their money to banks and then banks, in turn, lend that money to borrowers. That would imply banks function to connect lenders to borrows. But that's not how it works. All banks are worried about is the balance sheet, measuring their assets against their liabilities. When banks create loans, the loan represents the liability, the borrower's promise to repay the loan represents the asset. So whenever a loan is created, it is always balanced with a corresponding asset at the moment of its creation, therefore there is no need for a bank to ever borrow money in order to give out loans. \n\nI think this is somewhat confusing to people because they don't commonly understand that banks create money in the form of bank deposits. Mechanically speaking, a bank doesn't need to have any money whatsoever to create a loan, they just type it into their computer and it appears in your account. Of course, in the old days when cash was what everyone used, banks needed to get a hold of real cash, and that is what has given rise to the common perception of how banks work and the idea that they function to connect people who have too much cash with people who have too little. When banks can create money because it is digital IOUs the way it is today, that system breaks down, banks don't need your digital IOUs because they can create them themselves.\n\nI would argue that many of the problems we are facing in society that revolve around the financial system stem from this corruption that has happened with modern banking that is ultimately due to the digitization of society and the absence of corresponding digital money, where I am defining money as an instrument of final settlement like cash. Because we have lacked digital money, we have had to rely on digital credit instead and that has given banks tremendous power since they are the creators of digital credit. This transformed them from being facilitators of the economy, from being institutions that helped move money around, to becoming a massive collective leech upon the society and the economy as most money turned into credit and essentially became indebtedness to banks.\n\nIn my view, digital cash promises to dramatically restore the financial system, and the entire economy, to sound footing in which the economic prosperity of one person directly translates into the prosperity of another, like a well-oiled machine. It is exciting!  ": 2, "The problem isn't the banking it's the fiat money.": 1, 'You make it sound like the banks aren\'t made up of people. You never said anything about giving away money to *everyone* for free! \n\nBut let\'s say they did do that, they did give it away to everyone. What would happen isn\'t all that different than exactly what is happening today. There would be massive bubbles in prices being created everywhere as everyone simultaneously borrowed money to buy things. If everyone can simultaneously afford the same home, the value of that home is going to go up! Many people would buy houses and electronics and things they could only possibly repay by reselling the purchased items at a higher price than they bought them for. Fortunately, with inflation out of control, reselling things at a higher price would actually be possible, as long as the bubble lasted. \n\nBecause everything, other than money itself, would be going massively up in value, people who weren\'t investing their money to keep up with inflation would be screwed and would be forced to borrow more money just to get by, putting it all on the credit card. Then someone would default and the bank\'s balance sheets wouldn\'t add up and they would stop lending. Without the banks lending more money for free, everyone who needed the free money to rollover their debts would default. The value of money would begin to rise as people could no longer get it cheaply and the real value of everyone else\'s debts would skyrocket, causing massive defaults across the board. The whole economy would collapse. This is precisely what happened with the housing market bubble on a much smaller scale. And it is exactly what is happening now with speculative assets like stocks, only we are still within the bubble. \n\nThe *only* difference is that in today\'s scenario, the free money is reserved, as you said, for the rich, for the bankers, so the speculative bubbles being created is concentrated primarily around things rich people buy. It is still going to devastate society when it collapses and is really no different in its basic chemistry than the hypothetical scenario of free money for everyone, only that would be more extreme. \n\nSo it isn\'t fair to say I\'m "wrong."

This is honestly rarer than it seems in the Bitcoin space so you have my respect for doing this.\n\n3. App opens: wow. This looks incredible and has clearly changed a lot since I last used this. The software looks very intuitive and I can immediately see what I need to know. There is almost no learning curve for using this app.\n\n4. Lets try sell some Bitcoins.

A huge strength of this design that didn\'t immediately stand out to me before is how easily it can support a huge number of currencies (and payment options.) Since you\'re using collateral to enforce trades with Bitcoin, there\'s no smart contract code needed to be written for every special currency (which may not be possible anyway.) To highlight this -- the software supports both Ethereum and Dogecoin using the exact same contract code which are both completely different. So long as you can get a send address -- things can work from virtually any wallet, too. This is definitely quite interesting and reminds me a lot of BitHalo-style game theory.\n\nOverall, I am quite impressed. I\'ve never particularly been a fan of using collateral for contracts like this but I do see the benefits of doing so. Very nice work. Bitsquare may just be the ShapeShift of p2p currency exchange.\n\nEdit: obvious downsides -- Bitcoin is needed for every trade to serve as collateral. This means that if the user doesn\'t already have Bitcoin (quite likely if they\'re trying to purchase Bitcoin!) then they won\'t be able to trade. So this does make the software quite a lot harder to use and potentially inconvenient.\n\nUnfortunately, so far there\'s been no easy way to integrate USD/BTC without requiring the person to send their entire passport to some exchange to get "verified" and this might just be the nail in the coffin when it comes to adoption ... I really have no good suggestions for solving this problem.

Bitcoin is about monetary freedom, direct peer-to-peer exchange, and decentralized power. Coinbase is diametrically opposed to all these, it is about surveillance and censorship over what you can do with your money. It is about third-party control over your money. It is about centralized power, and this is particularly reinforced by their endorsement of big blocks and the centralization pressures that would come with that. Put simply, Coinbase is about turning Bitcoin into fiat money, and while all fiat exchanges suffer from this pressure, Coinbase embraces it with evil pleasure. I think many in the community were willing to overlook the faults of Coinbase as par for the course when dealing with the legacy system and government. But when they came out so ferociously against the core devs I think it shook everyone up and made us wonder, appropriately so, what this company is really all about. \n\nMtGox was vital to Bitcoin's early adoption, it was a necessary evil. But make no mistake, it was evil, and the same is absolutely true of Coinbase. This necessary evil that Coinbase represents becomes addictive because of how easy it is to use, that is what draws in so many users who otherwise would be too intimidated by bitcoin. But just like MtGox which gave Bitcoin a very tarnished reputation, Coinbase has been slowly and surely corrupting the very soul of Bitcoin by hooking users into an addiction to the very things Bitcoin is designed to free us from and eroding Bitcoin's fungibility. I genuinely consider Coinbase to be one of the greatest threats to Bitcoin's long term success, and the threat is only larger precisely because of the crucial role they play in Bitcoin's early adoption. This is, again, no different than how MtGox was a threat to Bitcoin's long term success and its collapse set bitcoin back significantly. We as a community need to wean ourselves off of this addiction and promote, encourage, and help finance those companies and DAOs that offer fiat exchange services in ways that don't undermine bitcoin's basic integrity. \n": 8, 'And I think you need to take some classes, read a book, and ask yourself "Is Coinbase Bitcoin?".

That\'s not sustainable. Starbucks issues $4B yearly in gift cards. If it follows a similar trend to the rest of the gift card market, 10% of those cards go unspent each year- probably more, because Starbucks does a great job marketing its program to rewards co\'s, etc. That means $400M a year that could possibly be bought in unspent Starbucks cards. We\'re building our business on other retailers as well, though, and across the US market, there\'s $120B in gift cards sold per year.\n\n*What\'s happening right now*\n\nWe haven\'t hit the limits of the market yet at this price point. We have, however, had trouble matching supply with demand on the tech side. It takes more work for us to process and transfer cards ourselves, and we don\'t have the throughput we need (yet).\n\nWe\'re planning to alleviate that by letting the discount slip when our inventory is low, and taking liquidity from other exchanges- and if those are out, we\'ll pull wholesale cards (similar to Gyft or eGifter). If we do that naively, we\'ll pay the same as a consumer would- but because we\'re a bulk buyer, we command better rates with both exchanges and issuers.\n\nSo, back to your question about exchanges offering 20% off at Starbucks. There\'s been a squeeze on the market the past couple months, including bulk buyers (possibly Starbucks themselves?) taking liquidity. Still, CardCash typically offers 11-12% off when they have inventory. They\'re charging an additional ~6% for payment processing (on both sides of the tx), + whatever their take is. That\'s 18% right there in our model.\n\nIf you want to keep track of this stuff, there are liquidity tracking sites (eg https://www.giftcardgranny.com/buy-gift-cards/starbucks/) that help give you an idea. Once you\'ve spent some time in the space, though, you realize that the public "order books" are a small part of the total liquidity, that the visible market is easy to manipulate (as we\'ve seen these past couple months), and that issuers are actively interfering and occasionally even quietly partnering with the exchanges.\n\nAnyway, I know this went on kind of long. Just realize our goal is to give bitcoiners the best the market can offer across retailers, maximizing their purchasing power-  not just a discount on their morning coffee.': 2, 'Where do these cards come from?
