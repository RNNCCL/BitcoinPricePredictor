I believe just the silk road was doing $40 million /month when it was shut down. And when you handicap for market cap, that ratio is hundreds of times worse.\n\n\nAs for transaction cost, I could drive 10 miles to a bullion dealer and get $15k worth of gold bullion today for a 2% spread.

So you get $1,440,000 total, that's the miners' revenue.\n\nIf their profit margin is 10%, the cost of mining is $1296000.\n\nNow let's say Bitcoin price goes to $500, now the revenue goes to $1,800,000. But initially the cost is the same, and thus miners get 28% profit margin.\n\nHigher profits attract more miners, difficulty rises, total cost of mining rises.

Let\'s say we are sending 150 GBP (so 145 GBP with OrbitRemit)\n\n145.00 = **4,815,542.89 VND**\n\nIn UK there are several ways to buy bitcoins, according to: http://bittybot.co.uk/buy-bitcoins-uk/ currently 239.27 GBP is the cheapest:\n\n150/239.27 = 0.83587578885\n\n In VN there seems to be 2 exchanges:\n\n* https://www.bitcoinvietnam.com.vn/index.php?lang=en (Sell: 7,719,700 VND - Fee: 0.001 % + 42,800 VND)\n* https://www.vbtc.vn/Home/ChangeCulture?lang=en-US (Sell:7,100,000 VND)\n\nSo Bitcoin Vietnam seems the cheapest:\n\n0.62690684164\\*7,719,700\\*0.99999-42,800 = **4,796,684.35 VND**\n\nSo OrbitRemit indeed seems slightly more cheap in this situation. Since they have a flat fee of 5 GBP for smaller amounts BTC will be cheaper. We can solve this by some math: (x-5)\\*33210.6406 = x/239.27\\*7,719,700\\*0.99999-42,800 I am just putting this on wolframalpha for solution: x = 130.09 So for amounts of 130.09 GBP or less the BTC way is cheaper, for higher amounts OrbitRemit is cheaper (at -this- moment.)\n\nA few considerations:\n\n* Maybe it is cheaper to convert GBP to EUR and send a free SEPA transfer to one of the "real BTC exchanges". I am not sure what the cheapest way to buy BTC is in the UK.\n* In the future there might be more competition in Vietnam for bitcoin "exchanges" which could give better prices.\n* The "cheapest way to send money" seems to be different all the time in my experience, so keep looking for cheap and good solutions, no matter if it is with bitcoin or not :)\n\n**TL;DR** it *looks* like sending from UK to VN is cheaper with bitcoin for amounts of 130 GBP or less, and cheaper with traditional way "OrbitRemit" for higher amounts.': 12, "This thread has been linked to from elsewhere on reddit.\n\n\n - [/r/BitcoinInternational] [Huge milestone for us: Our Bitcoin Remittance startup Rebit.ph just fulfilled more remittances in just one day today than in our entire first month combined. : Bitcoin](http://np.reddit.com/r/BitcoinInternational/comments/2nntue/huge_milestone_for_us_our_bitcoin_remittance/)\n\n\n*^If ^you ^follow ^any ^of ^the ^above ^links, ^respect ^the ^rules ^of ^reddit ^and ^don't ^vote ^or ^comment. ^Questions? ^Abuse?

Many of them won't be encumbered by excessive regulations.

You can enable it or leave it disabled. Even if you enable it you can choose to use the key file button or ignore it. It simply appends a hash of the keyfile onto the password. The password is used to AES encrypt the seed but not generate the seed.\n\nI don't believe there is any process memory protection in Electrum as it's written in Python and even though I've been through much of the code I've never noticed anything like that. It's a good idea that I don't know anything about. Maybe I'll dig around and see if there is a way to implement that for Electrum. I don't know if root is needed for accessing arbitrary memory in Linux but if so then an easier approach would be simply patching the Electrum source with a couple lines that send the seed upon decryption. That would be trivial with root access. \n\nI have considered writing Electrum seed store and signing code for a PIC microcontroller so that it could be self-built and programmed as a tiny Electrum dongle. I have past experience to do that but so far have not decided to commit the time. It would cost a hobbyist about $2 to make their own. It could work with a plugin for Electrum so that new wallet software need not be written. Use Electrum as watch only wallet (with MPK) that needs special dongle to sign trxs. Dongle optionally gens seed from static ram noise, gives MPK to Electrum via plugin, and signs trxs via plugin.\n\nI know there's Btchip and others but so far I haven't bought in mostly because I just don't really trust them yet.
