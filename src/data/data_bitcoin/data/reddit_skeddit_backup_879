In bitcoin we choose the right chain by selecting the one with more work. We dont need to trust anyone. In proof of stake you cannot really do the same because you dont know if the chain is signed from past or current owners and you need some sort of federation system.\n\n\n\nFirst of all there is a group trying to hard fork bitcoin planned in 2016 with bitcoin transaction history.\n\nHere is the link http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.5741\n\nProof of stake has multiple issues. The first two are technical and th last two are economical and debatable\n\nTechnical\n\nThe first is history attack.\n\nIn bitcoin we say it is trustless because you can join the network and be presented with many bitcoin blockchains. How do you choose the right one without trust? By choosing the one with most amount of work thus it is trustless\nWith proof of stake if you choose the right chain to be the one with most stake signed it has the following issue. A past stake holder / group of past stake holders / exchanges / casinos etc that had enough stake at some point in the history can go sign another chain with more stake and present you that chain. Which one you choose? Well you dont know thats why many proof of stake coins have forks and end up with checkpointing by devs or web of trust solutions and thus cannot be trustless. This problem can be fatal since it can reverse the entire history of transactions\nAnother issue is the nothing at stake problem.\nSay you are signing a chain as a stake holder and two appear. How do you choose which one to sign? Well since there is no cost a rational staker will sign all to maximize their chance earn money! In bitcoin they have no choice but to choose the one with most work so that they dont waste resources.\n\n\nEconmical/political problems\n\nAnother problem is that is much easier to identify the biggest stakers by governments/other organizations and target those individuals to comply with their demands.\n\nAnother issue is wealth concentration. Users are giving fees to large stakeholders basically to sign their transactions making the rich richer and hindering the growth of the economy. That argument is debatable though.\n\nLast one is that all PoS coins rushed to distribute their coins to go to PoS only benefiting the early adopters and panishing the rest. This supposed to be solved by early adopters distributing the coins to late adopters. That is not a good model and looks like ponzi thinking. Ideally you want noone to exit the economy.

This gave law-enforcement agencies a direct financial incentive to take more stuff, and led to what the Institute for Justice (IJ), a libertarian law firm, calls "policing for profit". In 1986 the federal Asset Forfeiture Fund took in $93.7m; by September 2013 the Fund held more than $2 billion in net assets. Some of those funds are disbursed to local law-enforcement agencies. As Sarah Stillman noted in her outstanding article on forfeiture abuses, many police departments depend on forfeiture funds to fill budget gaps, which further increases the incentive to snatch (for some, this is a feature, not a bug).\n\nhttp://www.vice.com/read/bad-cop-blotter-asset-forfeiture-the-cash-cow-of-the-drug-war': 7, 'Well said.': 2, "If people could sue for the damage the police does, the police folk would actually have to think before doing this stuff.

Well, just double the length of the ECDSA private key used could royally screw the attackers up, at a cost quite manageable(twice the ScriptSig length), giving us ample time to migrate everyone into QC-resistant digital signature algorithm like NTRUSign, or Lamport's signature while they chase us.": 3, 'Quantum computing will pose a risk for everything not just bitcoin.

Once the address has sent bitcoins, all the information a quantum attack needs to rob you becomes available.\n\nOnce a quantum attack occurs it should be widely known.': 6, 'Well, there is a common misconception as what bitcoin already can. Bitcoin features a pretty awesome programming language (ok, not touring complete, but enough).\n\nIt is common to say "bitcoin uses ECDSA" and you "send money to an address". Both is not the full picture.\n\nThink of it more like that: Each transaction you make is like putting a pile of money on a table and putting a piece of paper on top of it that holds the rules under which this pile of money can be claimed. Almost all piles in existence have pretty similar sounding texts on them. "This money can be spend by whomever is capable of proving that he holds the private ECDSA key to a public key of which the hash is XXX". But there are much much more things that could be written on that piece of paper. Multisig (own n of m keys in that way) or stealth addresses are just two examples. When people came up with stealth addresses there was no need to fork bitcoin, they lie within the possibilities of the script language that bitcoin already has.\n\nAnd if ECDSA becomes unsecure and a new private public key pair algorithm comes up you would just write that on that piece of paper. Old piles of money would still have the old papers on them but it is possible to move them to a new pile under new rules.\n\nOk, there are some minor details. Writing the whole set of rules to check keys on that paper is lengthy and it is inefficient to have that on each of the piles (although possible as far as I can see) so it might be a good idea to add a new command to the script language that goes "check the key according to algorithm YYY". For convenience. And adding such a command would be undisputed. But that\'s about it then.\n\ntl;dr Yes, I know what forking is. I stand by what I said.

Is is because of the anonymity of them?', 0): {'TL;DR - lots of people are not aware that they have a speculative currency and that they\'re needed to increase the perceived value of said currency in order to cash out ("future\').\n\nBitcoin can work, but as it chugs along I\'m legitimately surprised at how infrequently this aspect is discussed. As it stands now, Bitcoin is not something even close to spendable without proactively looking for places to use it. It\'s the biggest sales pitch of recent history, but it may work because the salespeople don\'t realize they\'re the pitchers. ': 1, ">Why do bit coins have a future? \n\nWe live in a super fascinating new era where ubiquity of Internet access is gaining momentum and considered a human right by many nations of the world. I suggest you read the Satoshi White Paper. \n\nBitcoin was the first of its kind, it has momentum to gain traction on the uphill battle of the technology adoption curve. Other coins probably aren't going to gain on the market cap of Bitcoin because they don't have the same large talent pool, no unique value-added features, etc. Besides, Bitcoin is adaptable. Policy can be modified. Features can be added. Bitcoin is open source and influenced by the majority but ultimately controlled by a trusted, voluntary, suitable benevolent dictator much like Linux is controlled by Linus Torvalds. \n\nBitcoin was the first digital currency to solve the legendary problem of electronic money. It indiscriminately provides a secure, decentralized electronic ledger as a public good. A ledger as means to plan resource utilization is the value of that money really is.  The legendary problem of electronic money is that computers are very good at making copies of things. So, Bitcoin exploits this by putting copies of the ledger everywhere using a distributed hash table--the Bitcoin Blockchain.  Because it is everywhere on the millions, billions(?) of computer systems of worldwide volunteers, it can not be destroyed.\n\n Bitcoin uses breakthrough mathematics (a fraction of one human lifetime old) called elliptical curve encryption to solve the problem of trust. The problem with trusting a central authority leads to abuse, exploitation and anger. Large systems like government and corporations are self-evidently highly susceptible to corruption. No human or computer can break the encryption of Bitcoin. You would need a computer the size of the universe to get a fraction of the way through the keyspace until max entropy is reached--so very likely impossible to crack. The one controlling the private key of a Bitcoin public address is the one who controls spending (subtracting) from the ledger balance. When you own Bitcoin, you really own the private key--power to spend the Bitcoin value on the ledger for that public address  (account).\n\nBitcoin has a built in monetary policy to limit the supply. The amount of Bitcoin which can be mined is predictable and awarded by luck. The reward amount decreases every set number of blocks (about every 4 years) until every Bitcoin possible is mined in 2140.  Deflation is a reward to give incentive for adoption. \n\nBitcoin has enormous value added service as a system of programmable money. Tip bots, micropayments, peer to peer finance, international remission, and the upcoming fad: business to business remission. Bitcoin adds value of removing corruption because the ledger is publicly available for reading. Money on the Bitcoin ledger can be traced, tracked, followed, audited, and accounted for. Bitcoin has potential to end war, poverty, and economic dishonesty.\n\n>Is it because of the anonymity of them?\n\nBitcoin is pseudo-anonymous. If you can remove your personal identity from being tied to a public address, you are anonymous. That's easier said than done considering how much info you have to give to trade fiat for BTC most efficiently. \n": 1, '/u/Banana-Man asks on the top trending reddit and  he got more than 550 answers! :-)\nto the moon!': 1, 'No. \n\nThink about the internet.. It allowed communication to become decentralized. We no longer get our media from the top down necessarily, as we can converse peer to peer on the internet, among other things. That breakthrough in communication changed the world. \n\nThere is a small but arguably the most important subset of information that has so far not been able to be decentralized. That subset is value / money. Until bitcoin we had to rely on centralized corporations / institutions (central banks, banks, credit processors, corporations) to make financial transactions on the internet. Now we have a decentralized system to store and transfer value on the internet in a decentralize way, making central banks, banks and credit processors irrelevant. \n\nIn my opinion bitcoin is a bigger breakthrough than the internet itself. We now have a distributed, decentralized ledger of wealth that solves the problem of fiat currency being watered down through inflation while at the same time allowing transactions to occur faster, more securely and for a tiny fraction of what it cost legacy systems. \n\ntl;dr bitcoin is the internet of money and is a breakthrough for civilization.

But I'd definitely say that they're less expensive, quicker and easier than Coinbase, perhaps not by an order of magnitude (10x), but that's besides the point.\n\nFact is, a lot of first time buyers at Coinbase spend a few days waiting for their bank transaction to clear, for their account to be verified, then pay 1% in an interface that already, despite being pretty sweet, isn't as simple as that of Circle, who offers instant and free purchases and a telephone service for anyone who has problems.\n\nIt's a game changer. The big difference is that Coinbase has 1.6m wallets and Circle is in closed beta with problably no more than 25k at this point.\n\nIt doesn't take a genius to figure out that if Circle had 1m users who called the company once a year on average, and make 1 bitcoin transaction a week and 6 buys a year, that it's expensive. That means on workdays you get almost 4k phone calls a day, say a call takes 5 minutes, that means 300 hours per day of employees manning the phone at $15 an hour, is $1m a year in costs. It means you process 50m bitcoin transactions (average fee at 10c) per year at $5m, and it means you process 6m buys, with ACH transactions costing 25c that's 1.5m a year. In other words, you need to generate an average revenue per user (ARPU) of about $7.5 per year to break even on some of the basic services they offer. \n\nNow the ARPU for google is close to $30, but Facebook is close to $3 or so, Paypal sits at about $35. Circle of course has no revenue, but it's small, so it can do this. Coinbase with 1.6m wallets would be out over $10m each year if they did the same, so of course they're not as good. That's why they have a 1% fee. If an average user buys $1k of bitcoin, that's their $10 ARPU right there to cover a lot of their operations. And the 1% is both for buying and selling, combined with their merchant services, they can be profitable and grow quick. But it does mean they can't be as good as Circle who are offering a slick, free and instant service unseen anywhere else.\n\nOf course Circle is looking to do innovative stuff. Over time, big complaints get worked out and a support center develops to the extent that phonecalls become less needed, shorter and less common. Over time the protocol will provide ways to push costs down, and various alternative blockchain-based payment channels will reduce fees. Over time the amount of buys will likely become bigger and less frequent and more peer-to-peer, reducing banking fees. So Circle has a very good chance of building this free/instant service out to millions of users without going bankrupt.
