For example, I could send 10 bitcoins to an exchange, day-trade it making 10 trades per day for 6 months, and then take off all the bitcoins I earned or that remain.

I think it\'s likely that liquidity deficit is still being felt. 400 million USD in bitcoins and god knows how much in USD/other currencies disappearing from the Bitcoin market is incredibly bad. I\'m sure we lost thousands of Bitcoin enthusiasts, speculators and regular users with the abolition of Gox.\n\nEven in light of that, I\'m actually very impressed by how it has picked itself up and soldiered on regardless. We have dozens of exchanges, hundreds of ATMs, brokers all over the world, and lots of innovations reaching maturity now that were still only concepts a year ago, so I for one am in full agreement with Brock, Bitcoin is, even in light of significant setbacks, is growing and being adopted more and more. The fundamentals are far far stronger than a year ago, but people are still blinded by price movements as being some kind of indicator of the health of the Bitcoin economy, it\'s ridiculous. \n\nIn the context of the valuation of the Australian dollar, economists are actually complaining that the dollar compared to the USD is too high and needs to go down for the economy to grow more stably, which just goes to show that skyrocketing price =/= good for the economy, same goes for Bitcoin, this will keep the money circulating to more hands the more it is spent, since many holders are spending/selling and once they have taken safer positions, the price will level, and new speculators, seeing the floor has been hit, will buy, etc. etc. This honestly shouldn\'t surprise anyone.\n\nI think everyone is just expecting too much, too soon and continually cease to see the bigger picture.': 28, "If you look at the chart you've linked elsewhere, you'll see that the total amt. of bitcoins transacted has been flat for longer than a year - it hasn't gone up at all, [even during previous bubbles](https://blockchain.info/charts/estimated-transaction-volume?timespan=2year&showDataPoints=false&daysAverageString=1&show_header=true&scale=0&address=).

But I'd put 90% of my bitcoin on the bet that they aggregate their sell off. It's extremely unlikely that everytime you send bitpay bitcoin, they send that bitcoin to another party for cash. Much more likely is that Bitpay sells their coin on an exchange (requiring no blockchain transaction at all) and then takes all bitcoin revenue for that day and forwards it to the exchange to top up their account once a day. Same idea for private non-exchange deals.

Even if this was the case (I'd have to look into it), it'd likely be a signal that bitcoin is shifting from just being an asset class (people trading only $250 or $1000 or $10k worth of coin for speculation) to something being used on a day to day basis (people buying pizza delivery online for $20, people buying some bedsheets for $30, or a new harddrive for their PC for $80.) Looking at the trend of bitcoin adoption (mostly focused on online commerce and remittance) that seems in line with expectations.": 6, 'It\'s not just "price vs. usage," but "all the money entering the Bitcoin ecosystem vs. usage" that is revealing.\n\nBitcoin has this interesting dynamic where making money off BTC price appreciation doesn\'t always mean buying bitcoins directly. For many at certain times, it means buying mining equipment. For others it means starting a miner manufacturing business. And for others it means investing millions in Bitcoin-related startups. For still others it means quitting their job and using their savings (which they otherwise would have invested into BTC) to support themselves while they work on Bitcoin projects full time. Depending on the conditions and your expertise, any one of these could at times be a more efficient way of getting bitcoins. For example, you may end up with more bitcoins if you spend $50,000 on starting a business in the ecosystem than if you just bought that many bitcoins. Or you may make more money if you spend it on mining equipment, provided you have the expertise required. \n\nThe point is, what should be compared is usage vs. the total money flowing into the Bitcoin space, and only if certain conditions are met is this money flow reflected substantially in the price. The conditions would be, for example, the startup and mining sectors becoming saturated. Then the full force of those exponentially increasing fresh flows of fiat hit the exchanges directly.\n': 2, 'yep!': 1, "> based on what information are you sure \n\nI'm not sure. Just like that I'm not sure you're not president obama chatting on reddit about bitcoin transactions. But experience and common sense tell me that it's quite unlikely.\n\nSimilarly, experience and common sense tell me most transactions are not incoming/outgoing to/from exchanges. Most people trade on an exchange many times over after depositing before withdrawing. Just ask anyone, run a poll if you want. Those who buy and withdraw from an exchange tend to do buy in bulk, e.g. they'll buy $500 or $5k and then withdraw, and then spend that in small amounts here and there, like sending a friend money for some beers he bought you, ordering pizza online or buying the humble bundle. Just looking at typical exchange behavior, people make many more transactions than deposits/withdraws.\n\nIt's like playing a game of poker. You buy $100 of chips once, you play poker for a few hours, you move those chips around a shitton of times, and then you withdraw once. I don't have to present any data to know this is true, it's just typical behavior. Nobody buys chips, plays one hand and withdraws. Similarly nobody deposits bitcoin, sells it on the exchange, buys it back on the exchange, then withdraws. It rarely happens, typically someone will deposit, daytrade for sometime and then withdraw. \n\nAnyway, perhaps more interesting to you are processor numbers. Bitpay said earlier this year they process over $1m (maybe 1.2 or 1.3m) of transactions daily, in March or so. So I think half a year later, $1.5m is a very cautious low-ball figure, considering their merchant numbers grow by about 300% year over year, and they've added a few billion dollar retailers since then. They've also had a $160m valuation as a company in May. Coinbase is similar, same valuation, same number of merchants, but more billion-dollar retailers. A $1.5m figure is likely, too.\n\nSo we get $3m from them, and then there's loads of other smaller payment processors. A big one (Mollie) in the Netherlands, a big processor in Japan, one in Australia, and various in Latin-America and Europe. I'd say between the lot of them, $6m of daily processing is again a very cautious figure.\n\nNow the amount of transactions daily sits around 60k. If you'd imagine that the average purchase at one of these tens of thousands of merchants is $50 (between a $15 pizza or a $500 Playstation or $1k macbook air at Newegg or Tigerdirect), that'd mean that these payments would comprise of about 50% of transactions. Add to that some betting, some non-payment processor payments, some on-chain trading like localbitcoins or mycelium, and all this to/from exchange activity is really negligible. \n\nAnyway these are all rough numbers, but I don't think anyone thinks the majority of bitcoin transactions are to and from exchanges. There's nothing to suggest it, and there's a lot of data to suggest otherwise.": 1, "As usual, you're making a succession of good points.  Thanks.": 1, 'Except total number of bitcoins actually transacting is flat. And their value is down. All this means is that more small transactions are taking place.

Hence the increase in transactions, that's my point.": 1, '>That which does not kill us makes us stronger.\n\n>--Friedrich Nietzsche\n\nHe was talking about states, but that\'s because "complex systems" wasn\'t a thing yet. That\'s why you hear "it\'s actually a good thing" so much.': 1, "> is that better for you?\n\nIt's not about what's 'better' or 'better for me', it's about what is true. You simply stated something that is outright false.\n\nNow you adjust it and conclude that the daily amount of volume is lower than 10 months ago when bitcoin was in the middle of it's biggest hype bubble ever. I'll grant you that's factually true, but no conclusions can really follow from that because if you look at the charts, that's simply the history of bitcoin. For example, take last year September, bitcoin was way down around $20m daily compared to earlier that year of $60m daily. But that point was a temporary spike, a bubble. To have concluded then that bitcoin wasn't trending up but down would be foolish, and indeed it trended back up to a point where we now see early 2013's bubble be a typical day. \n\nSame with January 2012. Temporarily spiked to $10m and then fell to 0.5m and grew very slowly back to 5m in the 12 months after. In September 2012 the daily value was $3m, obviously DOWN from the $10m but OBVIOUSLY trending up, and up from a year ago. It'd be silly to cherry pick that bubble and use that as a benchmark. \n\nIn short, if you really want to take the graphs and look at the numbers you can see that the trend line slopes up in the long-term view. Of course you can pick and choose cherry picked peaks and troughs like you're doing picking 10 months ago as a bubble moment, and now. But that'd show a very myopic picture.\n\nAnyway we can agree to disagree I guess. I'll say this, bitcoin transactions are way up year over year, are lower than the temporary hype bubble of late last year, and daily usage and transactions are also way up perhaps with smaller transactions, which indicates growing consumer level adoption rather than a focus on bitcoin solely as an asset class investment opportunity.

Only direct buying contributes to price rises. \n\nThis suggests that as long as money continues to flow into some sector within Bitcoin, the price will eventually follow suit. \n\nCase in point: this year we've had tremendous investment by venture capitalists and miners, but dull price action. The money spigots have simply been redirected. When they turn back to buying bitcoins, watch out! Once the startup field and mining sector are temporarily saturated, that stream of interested VCs and miners will become a stream of direct investors. And then once the price has risen too far, people will again be incentivized to focus on startups and mining. \n\nEDIT:*Of course it's more than that, in effect, due to variance, equipment costs, time investment, expertise limiting the pool of people who can mine, delivery issues, etc. The point of crossover where the cost to mine a bitcoin rises to the level that it becomes cheaper for a typical new entrant into the Bitcoin space to buy bitcoins directly rather than mine them will be significantly lower than the market price.

Also there are already quiet a bunch of merchants that provide sizable amount of discounts for Bitcoin purchases, which means that by easier access to Bitcoin, mainstream consumers will have a valid reason to acquire coins just so they can purchase products and services on a discount. Increased liquidity and mainstream recognition MIGHT lead to lower volatility which in turn will strenghten the core functionallity and ideology of Bitcoin as a currency.\n\nThere are only just a few things I'm still concerned of.

All I have to say about Circle\xe2\x80\x99s official public launch is that it is worth the wait.  \n\nThe company is launching its site to the masses and internationally today, available in English, Spanish, German, French, Portuguese, Japanese and Chinese - enough to initially cover 40% of the global population.  Its account balances will render in over 160 different currencies, responsive to the individual user\xe2\x80\x99s IP address, and the same deposit and withdrawal limits will apply for all new users.  Circle will slash or eliminate its $10 sign-up bonus, but that is AOK to me given the company\xe2\x80\x99s continued commitment to fee-less transactions.  \n\nFor a sizable portion of the Bitcoin early adopter crowd, Circle won\xe2\x80\x99t feel like bitcoin, it will feel like banking 2.0.\n\nAlthough anyone will be able to open an account with an email address and phone number, Circle\xe2\x80\x99s international users won\xe2\x80\x99t be able to connect bank accounts just yet.  They will, however, be able to deposit money for a small fee from any Visa or Mastercard card.  Perhaps more importantly, users will be able to send bitcoin to new email addresses or user anywhere in the world via the company\xe2\x80\x99s beautiful, confidence-inspiring web wallet.  Circle seems content to launch internationally and on-board early adopters before unveiling formal banking partnerships \xe2\x80\x94 an intriguing strategy.  The second that Circle signs a deal with a bank in Latin America or Africa or Southeast Asia, free international remittances could actually become a reality.\n\nThe company\xe2\x80\x99s mobile wallets are also \xe2\x80\x9cimminent,\xe2\x80\x9d and I was shown both the Android and iOS apps during my visit to the company\xe2\x80\x99s rapidly growing office in Boston.  The Android app will be full-featured from Day 1, while the iOS app will not allow deposits or withdrawals due to the App Store\xe2\x80\x99s policies.  \n\nCEO Jeremy Allaire was characteristically tightlipped about specifics regarding his company\xe2\x80\x99s underwriters (\xe2\x80\x9cthey are highly rated\xe2\x80\x9d), banking partners (\xe2\x80\x9cwe have a great US partner; not ready to talk about international banks yet\xe2\x80\x9d), future products (\xe2\x80\x9cwe are focused on this initial roll-out\xe2\x80\x9d) and KYC/AML policies (\xe2\x80\x9cwe\xe2\x80\x99ve spent a lot of time on this during the beta\xe2\x80\x9d).

Additionally, do you accept pre-pay and/or gift Visa cards? There is a lot of hype in the media saying that you do, but it didn\'t seem like people who said they tried it had consistent results.

(Circle)\nOct 08 08:41 AM\nHi,\nGreat question. The way to add funds to you Circle account is to connect a US bank account or credit/debit card, but these accounts have to be owned and operated by you, plus associated with your address.\nThis means that pre-paid and/or Visa gift cards will not work. Unfortunately, Paypal doesn\'t work because they do not link to your identity in the same way that an official banking institution would.\n\n-->I have also heard that there is a rumor that Circle accepts prepaid and gift cards. This is false. Circle does not support them.<--(my emphasis)\n\nI completely understand why this would be helpful for you to turn ebay cash into bitcoin, but neither gift cards nor paypal will work with Circle.\nLet me know if you have any more questions. Have a great day!\nApril\n\nOct 08 06:27 PM\nOk,\nThanks for the update on the rumor(s)- you might want to let Reddit /bitcoin people know that because it is being circulated there widely. Meantime I just want to double check a few things:\n\nYou are aware that your service allowed me to add my PayPal card. And just in case you\'re not aware, it\'s a Mastercard debit card funded off of cash already sitting in the account, which does require bank account and other identifying info (SSN) to open, etc... and can be used both for running standard MC debit/credit-style (ie they require your signature) transactions. It\'s embossed with my name and everything lol. So not sure why you guys won\'t take these if you take regular credit cards since this can only use confirmed funds I\'ve already either earned via eBay sales or deposited from my bank account, there\'s no credit option (Paypal has other cards/lines of credit but this is the MC card running off the cash balance in their account only).\n\nSo question two: will a pre-pay Visa issued with my name embossed, mailed to my address, by a bank work? As opposed to the non-embossed drug store kind?\n\n3rd question: If none of those work, can I use an online bank account to deposit from (and I assume, withdraw to)? To be honest, I don\'t want to give over my \'good\' bank account info with all the (no offense) bitcoin scammer start-ups that suddenly fold, taking everyone\'s bitcoin, etc.. But would be really happy to have a way to make some of my online income into bitcoin safely.\nThanks for your time! :)\n\nApril M. (Circle)\nOct 09 11:23 AM\nHi,\n1) It seems that some cards can be added, but the charges won\'t go through. This will change, to avoid the confusion.\n2) Unfortunately, no prepaid Visa will work either!\n3) I completely understand your hesitation to provide, in your words, a "good bank account," however we must build mutual trust in order to process transactions. Circle takes it\'s security and identity confirmation very seriously, and -->without a bank account that is connected to you, we cannot process transactions.<-- (again my emphasis)\n\nIf you do not feel comfortable, let me know if there is anything else that I can provide to make you confident that Circle will protect all information that you send our way.\nHere to help,\nApril\n\nOct 09 02:46 PM\nHi again,\nSo just to confirm (because I wasn\'t sure from your last response)- an *online* bank (US) is(? or isn\'t?) ok to add? I don\'t want to go to the trouble to set one up to have it rejected by Circle again.\n\nFurther, are ALL MC and Visa branded (US) credit and debit cards accepted? Or is there a list somewhere of what is/isn\'t allowed? If the first part of this question is true, then PayPal\'s debit card should work, correct?\n\n..basically I\'m looking at a situation of limited credit, I only have my PayPal account, my bank account and he ability to get pre-pay Visa cards etc.. I\'m not interested in building trust (that\'s accomplished when you guys are around for years and don\'t scam by saying you were \'hacked\' while making off with everyone\'s bitcoin - IMHO- again no offense), I\'m interested in finding a legitimate platform that would facilitate straightforward buying/selling as you advertised extensively in the media before your opening.\n\nThanks again for your help, I would appreciate a clear answer to the questions above as it seems there\'s a lot of people in the bitcoin community wondering the same things I am right now ;)\n\nApril M. (Circle)\nOct 09 02:53 PM\nLet me try again :)\n1) "Online" bank account is a bit of a vague term. I know that Simple Bank, an online bank, works. You would have to try it to see if we accept it.\n2) Mastercard and Visa US credit and debit cards are supported, but not prepaid or gift cards, even backed by these institutions. \nI hope this will work for you!\nApril\n\nAs you can see, I incessantly annoy her with my questions but she never addresses the fact (AFAIK been using them 10ish years)- PayPal MC debit card IS a regular MC card (not pre-pay/gift), it DOES require bank and SSN ID info to open etc... If there is chargeback risk with all cards, it is actually prolly a bit less with PayPal who is very strict about holding (your cash) funds til they clear, especially with newer users. She implies you can add at least the online (as in, no brick and mortar presence) bank Simple Bank, but then is vague immediately after. Is she saying you must have a bank account added to do any transaction? I wasn\'t aware of this if so- or maybe they invented this policy in the last 72hrs also? lol :P \n\nAlso I highlighted where she negates the \'rumor\' they will take pre-pay and gift Visa, although later I found someone quoted a Circle officer saying to (at least the tech) media, that they would be taking them. Not sure if this really helps because they are so vague/make it up as you go about their rules, but maybe it helps save others banging their heads against the Circle wall. YMMV! :)\n': 2, 'Awesome!

All transaction and configuration messages are signed by the sender and verified by the receiver. Each message contains an embedded HMAC OTP, to prevent message replay. The device can only respond to these predefined messages. Others are rejected. An authenticated device could be driven by malware.
