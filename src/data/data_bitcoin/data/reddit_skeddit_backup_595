Initially enough BTS worth 300% of the value of the shorted BitAssets needs to be locked as the collateral backing the short.

These incredibly *conservative* limits mean undercollateralization occurring should be an *extremely* rare event; hence why it\'s called a black swan event. \n\nThe black swan event refers to BTS value dropping a lot in a very short amount of time such that the margin call, which is triggered by the collateralization level falling below 200%, isn\'t able to sell BTS for the BitAsset fast enough to cover the entire debt before the collateralization level drops below 100%. \n\nIf you actually study the mechanics and economics of the system you should find that it all makes sense.

We call this a black swan event and you can learn more about it and how BitShares resolves the issue [here](http://bytemaster.bitshares.org/article/2015/01/27/BitAssets-and-Black-Swan-Events/?r=arhag).\n\nRegarding the "catch" with Nothing-at-Stake:\n\nFirst Nothing-at-Stake is an [overblown issue](http://bytemaster.bitshares.org/article/2015/01/08/Nothing-at-Stake-Nothing-to-Fear/?r-arhag). Nothing-at-Stake claims that anyone can produce a block at virtually no cost and therefore a user cannot know what the true consensus chain is. So let\'s clarify that definition.\n\nIn DPOS, *anyone* can\'t produce blocks. Only individuals (called delegates) who have been legitimately voted in by the stakeholders can produce blocks. If these delegates are active in the present time, they do have something at stake (their jobs that reward them with BTS). They are not allowed to double sign blocks and if they do, that cryptographic proof will be spread and stakeholders will vote them out.\n\nBut Nothing-at-Stake claims that old delegates could also produce blocks (and these old delegates who are not currently active would have no job to lose) and also old stake (say an attacker purchased previous stakeholders\' old private keys for very cheap since they no longer give access to any funds) can create a fake blockchain from some fork point in the past where they vote in fake delegates and continue the fake blockchain from there.\n\nThe important thing to note about these attacks (called long-range Nothing-at-Stake attacks, or LRNaS) is that the fork point occurs in the distant past (certainly older than the chain reorganization limit, which in BitShares I believe is 16*101 blocks or roughly 4 hours). Therefore, the only users who could be confused by this fake blockchain are those who have been offline since before the fork point and are now trying to resync. The appropriate thing for the client to do in this situation is to recognize it cannot resolve which of these chains is the correct one and ask for manual intervention (requires the user to input a trusted checkpoint into the client obtained via their social network of trust).\n\nIf this fallback to a social network of trust for resolving consensus was easy to initiate, then the entire system would be worthless (the blockchain would be under constant DOS attacks). The point of blockchain technology is for consensus to be maintained automatically to save users the trouble of achieving consensus the old-fashioned way. The good news is that pulling off a LRNaS attack is not trivial. It takes time to purchase all those old private keys, or to coordinate with all 101 retired delegates that were active at the same point in the blockchain history and convince them to all collude against stakeholder interests (even though their real identity might be known). \n\nThis means the fork point for LRNaS attacks will realistically be many blocks older than than the present head block. As long as clients sync frequently enough that they do not get stuck on such a fork, automated consensus can be maintained. I would argue that it is unrealistic to assume that the fork point for a LRNaS attack can be any more recent than 3 months in the past. Syncing once every three months is not a huge demand on the user.\n\nWhat about if someone has been offline for longer than that point or is syncing from genesis? Well there may still not be any fake blockchain attacks, and so syncing can continue as normal. If there is such an attack, the client can recognize this since we assume that information is difficult to censor on the p2p network (I am assuming the internet connection isn\'t completely compromised) and warn the user that they are stuck and need a trusted checkpoint to continue. Often times that trusted checkpoint will already be included in the client they installed (and this is not a centralization risk because other users with a synced blockchain can audit the code and detect if developers tried to sneak in a false checkpoint) and so the user doesn\'t have to do any work. But if the trusted checkpoint in the client is too old (e.g. the fork point is 4 months old but the trusted checkpoint in the client is 7 months old), then the user will need to get the trusted checkpoint through other means to continue syncing the blockchain.\n\nGetting this trusted checkpoint again does not require centralized trust. If you poll N people with reputations who are unlikely to collude together to defraud you, and they all give you the same block hash for some specific recent block, then you can be very confident that is the truth.\n\nSo at the end of all this we have given up strong objective consensus for weak subjectivity, we are exposed to a higher risk (compared to PoW) of being tricked onto a fake blockchain via LRNaS if the user\'s internet access is completely compromised and isolated, and there can be *rare* situations where the user is required to fallback on their social network of trust to resolve a fork and continue syncing the blockchain.\n\nSo why do we put up with this rather than using PoW? Many reasons. First, the cost of security with PoW is ridiculously high. If Bitcoin used DPOS it could take the nearly $280 million it spends on securing the blockchain and use almost all of it for other productive things like improving code, marketing, or just returning it as dividends to BTC holders. Second, PoW tends to [centralize](http://bytemaster.bitshares.org/article/2015/01/09/How-to-Measure-the-Decentralization-of-Bitcoin/?r=arhag) hashing power because of economies of scale, while DPOS does not suffer from such centralization because it allows users to *delegate* stake to delegates using approval voting (which is, by the way, the core reason for why DPOS is actually [more decentralized](http://bytemaster.bitshares.org/article/2015/01/07/The-Most-Decentralized-Proof-of-Stake-System/?r=arhag) than other PoS system). Third, the consensus model of DPOS allows block intervals to be reduced down to 10 seconds while still allowing users to have very good confidence (in less than 20 seconds) that their transactions will not end up on an orphan block, which makes the network operate very quickly and allows trading on the decentralized exchange to be tolerable to traders.': 2, '\nStill calling it BTSX, but overall a good article.
