Once mixed, they go back to your "spending pocket". Furthermore, you could have it set up so that all outputs of the coinjoin transaction have just a few denominations. For instance, I could send 2.57384092 coins as an input, and get back as outputs like:\n\n2+5x(0.1)+7x(0.01)+3x(0.0001)+8x(0.00001)\n\nThe small difference 0.00004092 btc, which would identify you, could be left as miner\'s fee.
