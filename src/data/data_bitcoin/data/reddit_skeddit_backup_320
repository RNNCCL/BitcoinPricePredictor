For this reason, until there is a more significant solution (e.g. "timestop" or other mining infrastructure penalizing attackers), LN should be used for everyday payments (what you\'re willing to keep in your wallet), with larger payments being on-chain (larger payments should probably be on-chain no matter what anyway, as they\'re directional flows that might be one-time payments larger than any channel you have open). Irrespective of your view on the block size debate, LN solves a space which is not well-served by on-chain bitcoin of decentralized instant payments and/or micropayments (the price of a coffee and below).\n\nHigher fees and temporarily overloaded mempools/blocks with non-malicious counterparties isn\'t a problem in LN, though.

I will clarify it, but only after I explain at length why I reject the whole premise of the question.\n\nThis used to be a technical debate about block sizes. We were presented with two bad choices: Keep it at 1MB which is obviously too low, or increase to 8MB/20MB which is obviously too high (obvious to me anyway). As a community we\'ve failed to reach a compromise, and I think that if more people pushed for a reasonable number like 3-4 MB in the short term (including also Gavin and Mike on one extreme, and Peter on the other), things would be different now.\n\nGiven that compromise failed, Gavin and Mike went ahead to push Bitcoin-XT, and now the real issue isn\'t about technology, it\'s about the philosophy of Bitcoin evolution. To me, Bitcoin-XT represents a somewhat reckless approach, which in the name of advancement shatters existing structures, fragments the community, and spins the ecosystem into chaos. Whereas Bitcoin Core represents a frigid approach, where no technology improvement will ever be made because consensus can\'t be reached, and where we can\'t do anything about the fact that we can\'t do anything, because of the delegitimization of attempts to change the status quo by forking and letting the best currency win (and make no mistakes, there *will* be many necessary technology improvements down the road; the block size limit pales in comparison).\n\nBoth choices are bad.\n\nI had plans once to write a paper about the game-theoretic aspects of changing the Bitcoin protocol, the contingencies in case of a fork, and how the mere threat of a fork can create a Schelling point which would prevent it from happening. I regret never getting around to it, because it might have been illuminating in the current debate. (For that matter, the other paper I had plans for writing was about transaction fees and how they relate to things like a block size limit; I regret that too, but again the block size is no longer the real issue).\n\nBut anyway, I do strongly believe that the *possibility* of forking Bitcoin - even if at first it has no consensus - is vital to Bitcoin\'s health, growth and survival. It\'s the glue that holds everything together and makes sure the Bitcoin economy has a say in case something goes wrong with the development. Ideally a contentious fork would forever remain a theoretical possibility - but if it is possible it means it can happen, and that\'s what we\'re seeing right now. Rejecting a fork on the grounds that it\'s a fork is wrong.\n\nOf course, there are reasons to reject Bitcoin-XT on the grounds that its timing and method are wrong. The objection to the technical change was too strong to just gloss over it. We\'re definitely not anywhere near the point where Pieter, Greg or Wladimir can be conceivably considered rogue and we should break away from them. Mike and Gavin have, quite arrogantly I would say, assumed that this is just like any other software change and that virtually everyone will just automatically follow them, where the reality is far from it. They didn\'t properly consider the consequences of making this move without enough support. (They might reply that they have been fighting for this for a long time and exhausted all other options, but I don\'t accept this - they made many attempts at persuasion, but not enough at compromise).\n\nSo here we are, having to choose between two bad alternatives. The mere act of choosing commits, in my opinion, the logical fallacy of privileging the hypothesis. There are millions of possible approaches, and "someone" out there restricted them to just 2. Most of the decision process (culling from millions to 2) was made for me and I\'m left rubber-stamping one of the choices that remain.

So we can only speculate based on the style and contents.\n\nFirst, after trying hard to understand the alleged security risks of large blocks, and finding only evidence to the contrary, I believe that they are just baseless FUD.  I understand the harm that congestion would cause and several reasons why the "fee market" would not work; and I see that either the Blockstream devs do not understand those problems, or do not care.   I can see that Blockstream plans of pushing all p2p payments to the LN would be the total negation of the reason why bitcoin was invented in the first place.  And more.  And I believe that Satoshi is more intelligent and has a better grasp of networks and social/economic games than all of the devs, especially the Blockstream guys, and is sensible enough to worry about the users experience.  Thus, I find it totally absurd that he would take the side of the Blockstream devs against Gavin and Mike.\n\nSecond, more along that line, the launching of BitcoinXT is nowhere as disastrous as the message makes it seem.  Other events, like the concentration of mining and the off-chain services like Coinbase and web wallet services like Blockchain.Info were much more serious threats to the project.  It was the Blockstream devs who painted the "hard fork" as a terrible risk for the future of bitcoin: not because they think it is, but because it threatens to take control of bitcoin\'s future away from them.  In fact, technically, there is no substantial difference between a "hard fork" (like BitcoinXT) and a "soft fork" (like BIP66).  In both cases, after the change is enabled, there are two versions of the protocol, one strictly more restrictive than the other.  What happens next depends only on how much hashpower each version has.  It makes no difference whether the more restrictive version is the new one or the old one (which is how soft and hard are distinguished).  The difference is only historial and psychological: it depends on which version the speaker is rooting for.  So, technically, the BitcoinXT fork is no more risky than the BIP66 one, and will be executed in a more responsible and competent fashion (with a grace period between the voting and the actual change, and alerts for clients to upgrade or downgrade).  And I am sure that Satoshi understands that perfeclty well.\n\nThird, while the low-level details of the style may match Satoshi\'s (I am not an expert to say), the higher-level ones are quite unlike the posts that I know.  My impression of Satoshi is a mature computer scientist, not just a good programmer but familiar with statistics, math, and networks; probably with experience in industry, that taught him how to interact with people productively in a work environment.  He was usually very dry, impersonal, and technical in his messages, even in the rare occasions when he seemed really upset (as when someone suggested connecting bitcoin with Wikileaks).  In contrast, this message is extremely emotional and dramatic, appealing to sentiments rather than logic.  Although he claims that bitcoin is not to be property of any personality, he contradicts that by intervening in a political squabble and by declaring the experiment a failure -- as if it was his role to do that.\n\nFourth, the message contains many memes that are characteristic of the Blockstream camp:\n\n> "*I designed it in such a way as to make future modifications to the consensus rules difficult without near unanimous agreement*"\n\n> "*Bitcoin was designed to be protected from the influence of charismatic leaders*"\n\n> "*its effect on the security of the network*"\n\n> "*we should take more time to come up with a robust solution*"\n\nThe first one, in particular, totally contradicts what I understand of Satoshi\'s thinking.  In his design the system *had* to be robust against change, but *because people would gain more to play according to its rules, anonymously and independently* -- not because of some social process.  By assuming that the survival of bitcoin was meant do depend on the players communicating, and getting to a consensus on some forum, the author of that message shows that he failed to understand the most important aspect of bitcoin\'s design.  Thus, a change was supposed to be adopted if and only if the players saw advantage in doing so, on their own. \n\nBut the following sentence is a dead giveaway:\n\n> "*If two developers can fork Bitcoin and succeed in redefining what "Bitcoin" is, in the face of widespread technical criticism and through the use of populist tactics*"\n\nThis has "Blockstream" written in capital letters all over it.

I had hoped the debate would resolve and that a fork proposal would achieve widespread consensus.  However with the formal release of Bitcoin XT 0.11A, this looks unlikely to happen, and so I am forced to share my concerns about this very dangerous fork.\n\n> The developers of this pretender-Bitcoin claim to be following my original vision, but nothing could be further from the truth.  When I designed Bitcoin, I designed it in such a way as to make future modifications to the consensus rules difficult without near unanimous agreement.  Bitcoin was designed to be protected from the influence of charismatic leaders, even if their name is Gavin Andresen, Barack Obama, or Satoshi Nakamoto.  Nearly everyone has to agree on a change, and they have to do it without being forced or pressured into it.  By doing a fork in this way, these developers are violating the "original vision" they claim to honour.\n\n> They use my old writings to make claims about what Bitcoin was supposed to be.  However I acknowledge that a lot has changed since that time, and new knowledge has been gained that contradicts some of my early opinions.  For example I didn\'t anticipate pooled mining and its effects on the security of the network.  Making Bitcoin a competitive monetary system while also preserving its security properties is not a trivial problem, and we should take more time to come up with a robust solution.  I suspect we need a better incentive for users to run nodes instead of relying solely on altruism.\n\n> If two developers can fork Bitcoin and succeed in redefining what "Bitcoin" is, in the face of widespread technical criticism and through the use of populist tactics, then I will have no choice but to declare Bitcoin a failed project.  Bitcoin was meant to be both technically and socially robust.  This present situation has been very disappointing to watch unfold.\n\n> Satoshi Nakamoto': -2, 'Yes.

I really don\'t know who to believe, but it really concerns me when people say that XT is basically an altcoin trying to hijack the Bitcoin network.\n\n"I\'m just a regular somewhat tech savy bitcoin hobbyist by the way, so the technicals of this debate are beyond me.\n\nBut what I want to know is, if we are going to use XT, who can then change or manipulate it latter on? will "consensus" (whatever that means) need to be used again for another change? Will this switch to XT centralize power into fewer hands, ie a few developers? If that\'s the case I want nothing to do with it."\n': 2, ">But what I want to know is, if we are going to use XT, who can then change or manipulate it latter on?\n\nSame as with Bitcoin Core - anyone. You can fork XT if you don't like how things are going.\n\nThe question is, who will follow you?\n\nPart of what's been happening with the block size limit discussion is that those in favor of an increase are trying to persuade a sufficiently large portion of the community that the change is both essential and urgent.\n\nWhoever can do that can change Bitcoin.": 2, 'When you accept a payment, you\'re accepting a digital token. It\'s like a metal coin in that it can be exchanged, but it\'s made of bits rather than atoms.\n\nOne way a digital token differs from a metal coin is *chain of ownership*. That means you can trace the history of previous owners back to a block subsidy payment. The chain of ownership is really a chain of transactions, each of which references a previous transaction. The last user on the chain owns the coin.\n\nIt\'s a little like the way provenance works in art. You can see the previous owners of a work back to the original artist. That provenance makes the work more valuable.\n\nArbitrarily throwing out blocks would lead to broken chains of ownership. Suddenly, many coin owners couldn\'t demonstrate an unbroken chain of ownership.\n\nThat said, there is a way to remove unneeded transactions called "pruning." Pruning eliminates previous transactions in a chain of ownership after it\'s been assembled and validated. The effect is to remove some, but not all of the transactions in a given block.\n\nThe price of pruning is interoperability. A node that prunes can\'t show another node the full chain of ownership, making synchronization more difficult if widely implemented across the network.': 1, "Bitcoin's killer app that gives it mass appeal will probably be something when people use they don't even know they're using Bitcoin, like how people using the web don't know they're using TCP/IP.": 1, 'Well the Bitcoin Bowl was a pretty damn big publicity stunt if you ask me, organized by BitPay.\n\nhttp://www.wsj.com/articles/bitpay-to-sponsor-st-petersburg-bowl-in-first-major-bitcoin-sports-deal-1403098202\n\nedit: just saw the paywall -_-\n\nclick the first link in google:\n\nhttps://www.google.nl/search?q=BitPay+to+Sponsor+St.+Petersburg+Bowl+in+First+Major+Bitcoin+Sports+Deal ': 3, 'Some miners could handle blocks which others may not.

The output will be JSON that encodes outputs, from which you can read payment addresses and amounts.\n\nCore can notify you when a new block is received using blocknotify:\n\nhttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=448565.0\n\nOr you can poll for new blocks. Either way, you can read the ID of the tip with:\n\n    $ bitcoin-cli getbestblockhash\n\nThis returns a block ID. Using this ID, you can read its transactions:\n\n    $ bitcoin-cli getblock <id>\n\nwhere <id> is the block ID. The returned JSON object contains an array of transaction IDs stored in the "tx" property. Using this array, you can iterate over each transaction ID, looking for an output that pays you.\n\nTo read confirmed transactions by ID, you\'ll need to enable txindex:\n\nhttp://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/35707/what-are-pros-and-cons-of-txindex-option\n\nAfter enabling txindex (and possibly using the -reindex startup flag if running headless, or agreeing to reindex if running the GUI), you\'ll be able to use getrawtransaction to read confirmed transactions the same way as you did with unconfirmed transactions.\n\nFrom the tip, you can read backward to the parent block using the previousblockhash property. Keep scanning backward until you get tired or find a transaction paying you.\n\nAs /u/Yoghurt114 points out, you can import addresses in a watch-only sense, but that takes about 10 minutes for each one on my system and IMO simply isn\'t practical.\n\n': 3, "The difficulty is irrelevant to the vast majority of network participants. Only miners care about it because their profits are directly affected by a change in the difficulty.\n\nThe block size limit is relevant to both miners aswell as nodes - a block size limit offers nodes a measure of certainty and predictability over whether or not they are able to realistically validate the blockchain some amount of time later. Without a limit, or an unrealistically high limit, nodes can't do this - they would be left to trusting the remainder of the network to do validation for them, which is a relation against every measure upon which Bitcoin has been created; *decentralized* peer-to-peer money; money *without* trust.": 6, 'I have some coins.

Blocksize testing happens - oh look that's an issue\n\n2. Bitcoin core sits on their asses\n\n3. Gaven + Mike team up to try and light a fire under their asses to fix this issue before it becomes a problem by introducing XT. \n\n\nThe problem I have with this is that I can see the Bitcoin core perspective as more valid then what Is trying to be done with XT. First of all, the blocksize issue doesn't appear to be an imminent threat causing mass devastation/interruption. Though I agree it could. evidence of this was seen with the stress tests causing backlogs of blocks, raising fees, unconfirmed blocks TEMPORARILY.\n\nthis was artificial traffic bought with a price. we aren't at a place yet were the network vitally NEEDS an upgrade due to natural traffic. But, we will be.\n\nWith that said, I think choosing XT RIGHT NOW and the risks associated with that kind of choice are greater then the risks associated with waiting for the Bitcoin core devs to implement a solution that everyone can agree on. We have time is what I'm trying to say.\n\nAnd until there is an actual prolonged distribution in service that causes doubt, XT will remain a choice of last resort, for me (currently. please try and change my mind), and others I'm sure.\n\nNow my hope is that Gavin and Mikes intentions with XT are to try and motivate the core team to do something, not to make an alternative Bitcoin where there is less decentralization where they become king makers. \n\nIf the first intention is true, then I can see its merit from a Machiavellian perspective. But this isn't Florence, this is bitcoin. going rogue and injecting that kind of energy into the space should only be done as a last resort. And perhaps it has and is.\n\nThat's my layman analysis.\n": 1, "There's no cryptographic proof it was Satoshi. And it doesn't read like Satoshi.": 14, "Yes, BIP100 proposes this.\n\nThe problem with this proposal is (warning: opinion piece) that this leaves the adjusting of the block size completely up to miners. They can still skyrocket the allowed maximum block size to thresholds where fewer and fewer nodes are able to validate, albeit very slowly.\n\n^(BIP100 does have a 32MB hard limit that is already present as a p2p message size limit, but I'm gonna disregard that for this concept, which I think itself puts too much control in the hands of miners)": 1, "You're probably at least half right.": 2, "What you're describing is a legitimate threat, and it's at least partly addressed by BIP70:\n\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0070.mediawiki\n\n> 3) Resistance from man-in-the-middle attacks that replace a merchant's bitcoin address with an attacker's address before a transaction is authorized with a hardware wallet. \n\n*(read: SSL and certificates)*\n\nPopular wallets support BIP70, and popular payment processors such as BitPay and Coinbase (and others) do aswell.\n\nHowever, if the entire server used to process the payment (which is not necessarily the 'storefront server') is compromised... Well then anything can happen. But in many cases you'll be able to detect something is awry, such as that the entity you're sending money to is not the entity it's claiming to be (just like you can detect your internet connection to your bank, while internet banking, is insecure - the browser will tell you). Typically it'd be possible for you to prevent paying a fraudster by detecting an illegitimate transaction process.\n\nBut disregarding any of that, worst case is that you'll make a payment to fraudster, where the fraudster essentially tricked the processor into believing the fraudster's address was legitimate. In that case the fault is clearly the processor's. Through BIP70 you are given a proof of payment:\n\n> Secure proof of payment, which the customer can use in case of a dispute with the merchant.\n\nThis proof proves your payment was part of a legitimate transaction with the merchant, which you would then use to resolve the dispute (legally or otherwise).\n\nTL;DR - Using BIP70 you'll be able to have reasonably secure transactions between merchant and consumer, and you'll have more legs to stand on in case of failure (from both the merchant's as the consumer's perspective). *Not* using BIP70 or a similarly secure payment protocol (in which you fetch the address you're paying to out-of-band in some way that's secure) is vulnerable to all of what you're describing, and more.": 7, "Thank you for the explanation. If miners could dynamically grow or shrink the blocksize, within fixed margins, wouldn't the network adjust when it's possible or required to do so? Leaving the ordeal we are stuck in behind us?  ": 1, "The point of bitcoin is a decentralized money anyone can participate in without trusting anyone. That last bit means you need to be able to validate the system is working correctly *yourself* (with no dependencies on anything) by verifying that the contents of the blockchain follow the consensus rules (such as the amount of coins in circulation, or that coins haven't been spent twice). If you aren't able to validate the blockchain, then there's no point in using bitcoin over anything else. The ability to validate the system is what makes bitcoin a special thing.\n\nHaving no limit to the size of blocks means there is nothing stopping miners from making arbitrarily large blocks such that this ease of validation no longer applies. Effectively, you could end up at a point where you're *trusting* miners to play nice and honest. An introduction of trust is detrimental to Bitcoin, therefore an elimination of the limit altogether is thought to be bad.\n\nNow, technology is continually improving, and the bitcoin userbase appears to be continually growing. So a static limit of 1MB is probably not the right value to have going forward: it's becoming easier to validate while the demand for size in blocks is increasing and supply is not. That's a meh.\n\nSo, already there's (at least) 3 variables here (ease to validate and block space demand/supply), and countless more perspectives on what those variables mean, which makes for an impossible equation to solve. This last bit makes the debate political rather than technical, which is the reason we've been experiencing the excruciatingly painful debate of the past few months, leading to terrible bias, 'sides and camps', prejudicial and wrong assumptions, poop fights and attempted censorship, heroes, villains, leaders and leavers.\n\nSo, that.
