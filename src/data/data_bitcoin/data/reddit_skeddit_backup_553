For a designer to make a successful contribution to an open source project they have to commit to it for the long haul. And it is a long haul - years of dedicated effort constantly tweaking and refining.\n\nDesigning at a professional level for desktop applications, as I'm sure you're aware, is a lot different to knocking up some HTML/CSS/JS in jsFiddle and seeing how it works in FF/IE/Chrome. at the very least you need to be sure that your design will work across several versions of each operating system. You'll need to know the limitations of the UI library that the developers are using.\n\nThings get more complication if the application has global scope, like a typical Bitcoin wallet. It has to meet accessibility requirements (physical and visual impairment), language (LTR/RTL, glyph rendering and variable phrase length) and culture requirements (don't show body parts like eyes or thumbs up as that can cause offense). \n\nTo be truly part of the wallet development team the designer must provide a careful analysis of user workflow so that user can reliably achieve their objective in a secure and reliable manner. Many designers would be scared off by the above list of requirements in a day job, let alone giving up that expertise for free in the evenings.\n\nThat said, we always [welcome polite and constructive feedback](https://github.com/bitcoin-solutions/multibit-hd/issues) to improve our work.": 4, "> If you visit the MultiBit HD (beta) website you'll see that it is made with HTML5/CSS3/Bootstrap/Responsive design.

Doing this increases the number of customers you will attract and the volumes of revenue they will feel comfortable sharing with you.\n\nDoing this directly contributes to your bottom line.\n\nWhen you are a couple of security nerds who get together to build a project you feel excited about which will have certain functional design goals, then every minute of your time is precious and gets dedicated to those functional design goals. There exists virtually no overlap between infosec training and UI/UX training, so nobody on the team has any experience with "squarespace templates", and quite probably can spare a lot more time than the $100 monetary cover charge to participate in that. Besides any $100 they *have* is first better spent on bits of hardware to test their software on or remunerating individuals who might contribute. Pen testers and hosting fees and such.\n\nAnother consideration is that design represents surface area of attack and that this is a piece of security software that is unusually allergic to attack. You want to use a pretty cross-platform framework for drawing windows? Well it turns out your Framework X dials home for updates constantly or to load dependent libraries or to assert DRM etc, which becomes a potential malware vector. That concern may weigh more heavily on websites and web wallets, but I\'ve run into it hundreds of times and I don\'t even *code* anything related to Bitcoin yet. :P\n\nBut at the end of the day what it all boils down to is "twice the number of users for your web wallet does not double your revenue". Your capital is nothing more than developer excitement and time donated, so you\'re going to get software that realizes that excitement for those specific people instead of software that panders to the needs of unwashed users.': 1, "Someone has to say this:\n\n1) Developers don't value design. Sadly, many think that it's something trivial that's added on top of their work - like adding a new coat of paint and some artwork to brighten up a room.\n\n2) Developers have a hard time understanding users. They're so focused on the underlying code that they have difficulty thinking how users will perceive their product. \n\n3) Making things simple for users often makes the backend more complicated. Developers don't want to make their life more difficult to implement what they view as a minor improvement to their application.\n\n4) Many designers suck at design. They wrongly view themselves as artists. They don't learn how to code, can't understand the problems of developers, and often produce designs that have no regard for the constraints of the underlying technology.\n\n5) Very few managers are both designers and developers. They are unable to provide the leadership needed to bring both teams together. They often create a culture where one aspect of a project dominates the other and breeds conflict.\n\nThis is my perspective based on nearly twenty years of designing, building, and marketing software products. \n": 2, "Don't give them instructions.

I think that\'s the underlying point that you\'re missing by getting hung up on whether they are deflationary or inflationary.\n\nRegardless of whether a currency is inflationary or deflationary, there is a market cap, and you only hold a small percent of that. The question you should ask is: "Who controls whether my piece of this market goes up or down in value?"\n\nWith dollars, the answer is the federal reserve, who can be heavily influenced by Congress to fund the latest American political BS.

Deflation, on the other hand, means that individuals have no reason to spend or invest more than they absolutely need to - contracting the economy (due increased saving which serves as a leakage to the economy).\n\nTo better explain it, Wikipedia has a good page on one of these effects (known as the paradox of thrift). Essentially it describes a situation where increased saving across an economy actually leads to a decrease in overall growth and, in turn, total savings.\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox_of_thrift': 1, "I think you're confused.  This is not a zero sum game like poker.  We are basically creating more wealth, not stealing it from others.  Inflation is what steals wealth from others by devaluing the money.  \n\nLibertarians want competition and free markets.  We want different currencies to compete against each other.  This is the most healthy thing and leads to more wealth for everyone.  Maybe an inflationary currency will be better, maybe a fixed currency is better.  The market will decide and determine what is best.\n\nStatists want centralized control over money with central banks. This leads to a monopoly and the money creators creating all the wealth for them and their cronies, at the common man's expense.  If Bitcoin were to succeed it could create a redistribution of that wealth away from the statist monoply men and towards the common man.\n\nAlso you are probably confused on the definition of inflation/deflation.  The true definition of inflation is an increase in money supply, and deflation is a decrease in money supply.  People have gotten confused over the years and now they refer to prices as inflation or deflation.  This shows the common misunderstandings people have about how economics works.\n\nHere is a video by peter schiff illustrating this point about what the real definition of inflation is: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jehln2l6ws&feature=youtu.be&t=1m49s\n\n\n\n": 2, 'Your premise is not correct.

Then pressure builds until there is so much resistance that the tech is changed completely or a new tech comes along that changes the game entirely and creates a new era in power decentralization. \n\nDecentralization always gets overrun with centralized control.  But the further technology goes and the longer you measure the trends the direction is ultimately towards more robust, universal, and uncompromising decentralization.  This stage will likely bring on the birth of many different inter-networks that do not rely on each other and do not speak the same language.  And I think it will also likely be the final push to encrypting communication protocols from the ground up, making much of the centralization obsolete.\n\nEdit: Bitcoin, maidsafe, bittorrent, and storj are great examples of the push to make the problem obsolete just as its getting real control.  These things present wildly more difficult challenges to the powers that be and they *already* exist.\n\nSecond edit: re-reading my comment I realize i implied centralization happens due to direct intent to control and this is actually rarely the case.

We preferred to have a working product that solves user\'s needs, even if it meant going with a centralized model.\n\n> does it require us to trust you or your company?\n\nPartially. Every action you make on the website is signed by your key, which is managed using client-side technology. This means that we cannot rate users on your behalf, accept contracts for you or even update your profile (if we did, we would not have a matching digital signature to authenticate it, and users could easily tell that it did not originate from you). Additionally, we cannot touch any user funds, intervene in any trades, or change the trust agent\'s decision.\n\nWhile we did our best to minimize trust and are not aware of any other web-based service that matches our level of trustlessness, there are three main things that still require trusting us:\n\n1. You need to trust our servers to serve you with the correct JavaScript code that matches the published open-source repo.\n\n2. Currently, Bitrated servers as a CA for your identity\'s public key.\n\n3. Censorship on the information published on Bitrated might be hard to detect.\n\nAll of these issues are things that we heavily considered, and we do have proposed solutions that are planned to be implemented in the future. The ["Trustless Server Model"](https://www.bitrated.com/security#trustless-server-model) section of our security page has some more information on that.': 1, "Yes, rating systems (like any other system that's highly depended on user-generated content) indeed have a strong network effects factor and do suffer from a chicken-and-egg problem.\n\nBut Bitrated is not just a rating system, and the other features that it has could help it build up adoption and bootstrap the rating system. Primarily:\n\n1. The payment system provides buyer protection and is useful to consumers as a standalone service, regardless of the reputation system. Users coming for the payment system are likely to start adding ratings as well.\n\n2. The reputation system allows users, as an opt-in, to leverage their existing online persona and past internet activity into measurable reputation. We're using that to help build trust and bootstrap the system while reviews and vouches are getting built up.\n\nThanks for the excellent question!": 5, 'This is the third time this has been posted (not the exact link) and every time I ask the same question (they answer every time but someone needs to ask):\n\nIs this decentralized and does it require us to trust you or your company?': 1, "Indeed they would!

By making trusted identities harder and costlier to obtain, we could make the cost of gaining trust and defrauding users higher than the potential returns from doing so.\n\nAn attacker on the Bitrated platform would find it quite challenging to create new trusted identities every other day and throwing them away, because it requires non-trivial time and effort. While many honest users have an established online persona and trust relations with other trustworthy users, attackers would find it harder to keep creating new trusted Internet personas (a 5 years old Facebook account is rather scarce and near impossible to obtain on a large scale) and getting vouched from other trusted members.\n\nIn addition, consumers can decide to only deal with merchants and agents that have a real-world identity attached to them, giving them legal recourse in case of fraud. This all depends on the market\'s demands and market forces.\n\nFinally, you seem to be talking mainly about the reputation system, so I answered primarily in regards to that, but the payment system also makes it non-trivial for a single attacker to fraud users.
