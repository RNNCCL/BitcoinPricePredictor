': 1, 'Well,  it is a very important difference for companies, legislators, law enforcement, etc.  -- and for individual users.\n\n"Your property" is what your government thinks that you have the right to possess.  It is the Law that specifies when and how the ownership of something changes (most commonly, when the two parties trade it, both willingly and well informed).  There are various systems to record ownership of various kinds of things (such as Land Registries for real estate, car registration databases, stock ownership registrars, etc).  A person who claims ownership of something is expected to use those systems as proof of it, or, at the very least, provide a store receipt, or testimonials.\n\nIf someone else takes possession of something that you own, but by means that the law does not recognize as valid ways of acquiring ownership (for example, by stealing the thing, by fraudulent trade, or by forcing you to sell it under threats of violence), then you have the right to go to the police, and they are supposedly obliged to use their power to take the thing from the possessor and return it to you -- because "ownership" means "legal right to possess".\n\nThe two things -- ownership and possession -- usually go together, so that people may confuse them.  Your bank statement, for example, shows the money that you "possess" (in some sense), but is not a proof that you own it. What proves that you own that money (in some sense) is the paper and digital trail of the transactions through which you acquired that money, that show that you did so legally rather than by stealing it, selling drugs, extorting people, etc.. \n\nOne of the problems for bitcoin\'s acceptance is that the transactions, by themselves, do not leave enough paper or digital trail to prove ownership.  Thus, when someone takes possession of your coins through theft or other crime, you may not be able to prove to the police that the coins are your property, and that they are not proeprty of the thief.  You may be even unable to prove that you had possession of the coins when they were stolen, that you don\'t have possession of them now, and that the thief has.\n\nThat is good for criminals, but is obviously not good for victims.   Now imagine, for example, a bitcoin exchange trying to prove to the police and to their clients that they lost the coins because of a hacker attack, and not by a "self-hacking".  Imagine a company that holds bitcoin trying to get insurance against theft.... ': 2, '> showing what I own\n\nActually it shows what you ***control***.  Like the key to a bank safety deposit box, your knowledge of the private key does not prove that you ***own*** the coins at the corresponding address; it only enables you to move them elsewhere.': 1, "eh, that's a distinction without a difference. For the purposes of casual conversation when discussing bitcoin, either word would work fine.": 0, '> So how does that work with the divisibility of bitcoin? Each coin has a million unique serial numbers? Or is it only assigned when I split one?\n\nEach coin has a specific value assigned. So like a $1 bill and $5 bill are both bills, they have different values. Likewise, a 1 BTC coin and a 5 BTC coin have different values (100000000 and 500000000 respectively).\n\nThese "coins" can *only* be spent/consumed - not split, sent, etc. When your wallet wants to send a smaller amount, it must consume/spend the whole coin and have the transaction\'s outputs create two (or more) smaller coins of combined value less than or equal to the consumed coin\'s value. Each of these new coins created is unique, not associated to the old spent coin, and have their own serial number and redeem script.\n\n> Lets say you send 1 BTC to my address. If I split that and send 0.5 bitcoin to another address, what happens to the original serial number?\n\nThe coin with the original serial number ceases to exist entirely.\n\n> If someone sends me a 0.5 BTC transaction so I again have 1 BTC in my address, do I have 2 separate half coins, or do they merge to create a new serial number?\n\nAgain, addresses do not hold bitcoins. Even if someone sends you 0.5 BTC twice to the same address (which only works by accident - individual addresses are not intended to be used more than once ever), your wallet contains two unrelated* coins valued at 0.5 BTC each.\n\n\\* While the coins are themselves unrelated, they can be proved to be controlled by the same wallet using blockchain forensics.': 1, "> knowledge of the private key does not prove that you own the coins at the corresponding address; it only enables you to move them elsewhere.\n\nThat's what ownership is.\n\nBTW are you the same guy who trolls the wall observer thread on the forum?": 1, 'Bitledger would be a good name for the blockchain if it ever needed a re-brand.

The balance of a wallet is the sum of all coins it knows how to spend.\n\nAn address is merely an opaque, encoded token that tells the sender how to produce a redeem script that the recipient's wallet knows 1) how to spend; 2) what the purpose of the transaction is (who it is from, what it is paying for).

These fluctuations are natural in a new currency and at the same time absolutely essential to its survival.  Manic speculative bubbles are what attracts the mainstream.  If you look up Bitcoin on Google trends the graph representing searches of the term "Bitcoin" is identical to bitcoins historic price graph.  Not a coincidence.  These surges in attention bootstraps Bitcoins momentum.  In time, the market for Bitcoin will gain enough liquidity where huge buys and sells will have only a small effect on the price.  May take a few years but it will happen.  In the mean time I look at Bitcoin as a superior store of value.

Don't worry.\n\nWhen you will use Bitcoins, you will learn more and more about that. Is there any specific term you would like me to explain?": 5, '/u/changetip 1000 bits': 5, "I'll have to check that one out. Thanks for the suggestions!": 1, "Thanks for the input. While I can see your perspective, I still think the WeUseCoins videos (original and even the updated one) are the shortest and most direct on-ramp videos to capture initial interest. Although it's true that Bitcoin is truly a ledger, and that the concept of digital tokens is a further abstraction, many may not yet have realized that all currencies are truly just ledger systems. For these uninitiated, relating Bitcoin to something physical that they are comfortable using and exchanging (cash) may still be a more accessible approach. Like it or not, the model is inherent in the cryptocurrency's name  Bit**coin**.\n\nPersonally, I haven't yet encountered particularly serious confusion from these competing explanations, but I do try to mention that Bitcoin's many characteristics can be thought of in a variety of ways. Perhaps I'll try to touch on the differences in approach the next time I make the suggestions.": 3, 'Let me try giving a simpler explanation. The problem with digital money is that digital stuff can be reproduced at basically no cost at all. I can, for example, send you a photo in an email, and it doesn\'t cost me or you anything. With physical stuff, that\'s not the case. I would have to buy the paper, pay for the ink, pay for the postage to send mail you the pic.\n\nSo you have this problem with digital money being reproduced, and the way companies like PayPal have solved is they have a database of usernames and passwords and dollar amounts, and when one person sends money to another, they go in their database and make the change. Simple.\n\nThe problem is then you have to trust PayPal, and moreover, PayPal becomes a political target. It can control what kinds of transactions occur, so it can be politically manipulated into limiting the types of transactions that a powerful person or group doesn\'t want to occur.\n\nFiat currency has a different issue -- the money supply is controlled by governments who can print as much or as little as they want, and a lot of the time, politics can cause the money policy of a government to run counter to what\'s best for its people.\n\nSo if you want to make better money, you need have to decentralize everything.\n\nWhat the bitcoin protocol is in the literal sense is a piece of code that networks all those running it. The code propagates a math problem, and everyone in the network ("miners") has the chance to guess what the answer is. \n\nWhen one node in the network guesses the right answer, it sends it out to all the other nodes, and if they agree, the answer is accepted, and the code makes a note that the node that got the answer has X more bitcoins ("block reward").\n\nFinally, all the while that nodes are trying to guess the right answer to the math problem, they also are holding the database of addresses and the amount of coins that each address holds, and they are listening for new transactions. These transactions are shared between the nodes and recorded into a new block once a miner solves that block. That block is then stored in the blockchain, shared by all miners and is protected by the profit incentive of all miners as changing the blockchain would require all miners to agree on the lie, and in the long term, that lie would undermine trust in the network, causing bitcoin to lose value.': 2, "In a nutshell, Bitcoin is a digital crypto-currency backed by Proof Of Work concept of mining. If you don't care about the technical details of Bitcoin, just think of bitcoin as a commodity that can also act as a currency.\n\nIt has hundreds of advantages over regular banking. Some of the main ones are:\n\n1) International. Bitcoins are borderless and can be transferred to any country.\n\n2) super low transaction fees regardless of the amount of BTC transfered. (~$0.02).\n\n3) Decentralized\n\n4) Limited supply (there can never be more than 21 million Bitcoins)\n\n5) Not controlled by any banks or governments.\n\nFor more info check out /r/bitcoinbeginners and /r/BitcoinWiki's wiki page.": 17, 'No problem, I thought of something to tell you about your new bits. Since they were just sent to you they have a kind of low priority, which means that if you send them you will have to compete with all the other transactions to be included in the next block. That is where the fee comes in.\n\nLet\'s say you send a transaction that is both new and has no (or a low) fee sent with it, it won\'t be included in the next block, so you will wait for another block. Again, maybe a bunch of transactions came in with fees and your transaction is bumped to the next block. Your transaction could be left hanging for weeks until you resend that amount with enough of a fee to be included into the next block.\n\nHowever, if you do not send a transaction now and hold the coins for months or years, your bitcoins become \'old\' and you will be able to send them with no fee. Also, they will be included in the next block with high priority. The algorithm is out there. This concept is linked to "Bitcoin Days Destroyed."\n\nImportant caveat: This only applies if your coins are being managed by your own wallet software and not a third party such as changetip, coinbase, exchanges, etc. If you keep your coins in the control of a third party, you can generally send with no fees whenever you want. But then you run the risk of not controlling your own funds, and that leads to Mt.Gox.': 5, "You just explained something flawlessly, and I just sat here with my eyes glazed over. I apologize.

The probability of all Bitcoin owners (those with a financial interest) , simultaneously, all choosing to inflate their holdings and wealth away by making a change to the core protocol to allow for, say, 50m bitcoins instead of 21m, is infinitesimally small and negligible.\n\nConsensus (objectivity) is why there can\'t be more than 21m.': 4, "I've stopped recommending the WeUseCoins video because I think it does more harm than good.

What is mining BTC and what does it to? When mining [as another user referenced, gold] you may find hidden things. Is this the case with Bitcoin as well?!': 5, "you're probably better off learning about mining and other technicalities through online resources, they'll be more thought through than Reddit comments.": 3, 'I\'ll give it a try if you don\'t mind. Before everything though, mining is a bad analogy for what\'s happening but unfortunately the name stuck.\n\nTo understand it in a fundamental level, you need to know a bit about how Bitcoin works and what problem it solves.\n\nNow, we have a network of computers telling each other what transactions they are making. X goes to Y, Z goes to A, etc. Obviously transactions are much more complex, but it doesn\'t matter.\n\nWhile broadcasting everything like that on the Internet is sufficient for everyone to know about these transactions, we still need a mechanism to order them. Furthermore, what if someone sends two conflicting transactions to two different parts of the network?\n\nWe don\'t really care *that* much about which transactions are better or more authentic, and we can\'t really tell that much without getting involved with meatspace. We just want there to be a consistent record of transactions so that we can move on.\n\nNow, if we make a bundle of all transactions we have heard about recently, check for internal consistency, call it a **block** of transactions, and put them in a database, would it work? It would be a consistent database in itself, but it wouldn\'t be coherent with the rest of the network. Not only ordering will be different everywhere, conflicting transactions will be recorded differently everywhere. If I tell one part of the network that I send A to B, and the other part that I send the same A to C, there can\'t be a consensus on what there is in A, B or C.\n\nIf only there was something DIGITAL that could NOT be replicated. Everything digital can be copied, right?\n\nNot exactly. There is a process we call **proof of work** that lets one make a *statistically* convincing claim that they have spent some level of computing power on a computation.\n\nSo if we can start with different parameters, each of these parameters will give different results showing the respective work that is spent on them. These proofs of work can\'t be copied from one parameter to another.\n\nIn Bitcoin, these parameters are the blocks themselves (remember the bundle of transactions I mentioned above). If you have a block and the proof of work that fits the network\'s criterion (which is called the **difficulty**), you have "mined a block". This proof is obviously calculated by a group of computers.\n\nCompeting to replace a proven (or "mined") block of transactions requires someone to make their own proof. Since blocks themselves have a reference to the blocks that come before them (for the purpose of ordering), the required computational power to invalidate a chain of blocks becomes harder as new blocks are mined.\n\nIn the end, we have a chain of blocks (the **blockchain**) that contain an internally consistent list of transactions and proof of work that would require an immense amount of computing power to forge.\n\nBut, why the word "mining"? Now, this system requires some sort of "reward" in order for people to spend all that computing power. Hence the transaction fees, which go to the entity which comes up with the valid block.\n\nAlso, since we are booting this system from scratch, we need to get these tokens distributed somehow. What better way than rewarding them to early miners to get it going? This part is what resembles mining the most.\n\nThere are other intricacies about mining that fit together well to form Bitcoin, but I guess this is already long enough.': 7, "Thank you.

If they have a backdoor they can either derive the private key from the public key, or from a signature, or from multiple signatures. The secp256k1 curve is an odd one in the bunch (because it's a very simple curve), but, unlike many others, the NSA did not create it.\n\nIn most bitcoin transactions the public key is not exposed (they are hashed using SHA256 and RIPE-MD) until the coins that are protected by its corresponding private key are being spent. For some (older type of) transactions, the public key *is* exposed, so if the NSA (or anyone) has a backdoor, they could potentially steal all of those coins. If they can derive a private key quickly (in seconds), then potentially they could also attempt to double spend any 'modern' transaction spenditure, which would be bad. But in any case, if it happens, then everyone will know, the NSA will have exposed their biggest exploit ever to hit the public, be hugely discredited, we will switch out the algorithm for another and be mostly fine (as far as the network itself goes). So far, the NSA or some other bearcat can only steal coins.\n\nAs for inflating the currency: No. This would imply they can either trick us into creating more coins than blocks allow, which is easily checked for and network consensus rules forbid, or they can somehow create valid blocks using a flaw in SHA256, which will be corrected fairly quickly after the next difficulty change. Whatever the case, there can never be more than the hard limit of 21 million coins because it simply is not allowed by the network consensus rules.\n\nAs for destroying, yes, they can destroy coins just like you and I can - if they are the owner of those coins.

Chain A **does not** evaluate the "full" rules of chain B; it only evaluates the "longest proof of work" rules. So if you can 51% attack chain B, you can in fact either (i) give yourself coins out of nowhere on chain B, and import them into chain A until chain B\'s "bank account" on chain A is completely drained, de-facto "stealing" everyone else\'s coins on chain B, or (ii) take out your own coins from chain B honestly, then double spend chain B to get your coins back on chain B, and repeat (with the same eventual result of stealing all the chain B coins).

This delay, incidentally, further increases the perception of stability. As long as the price change is always in one direction (inflation), and it is because it is controlled by the central bank, the delay allows for a continual wealth redistribution toward those who first receive newly created money since they receive the new money before prices have adjusted upward and prices don't actually adjust upward until they spend it. When they spend that new money, everyone else sees a loss in the value of their money as new money increases the overall supply. The amount that everyone else loses is the amount that the initial spenders of the new money gain.
