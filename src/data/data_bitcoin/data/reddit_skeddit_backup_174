This is just an added security feature to give more confidence to zero confirmation transactions. If the majority of miners choose to enforce this rule then users can be statistically more certain that a double-spend won't be performed on an unconfirmed transaction.\n\nThat's not to say that the majority of miners wouldn't change their minds and stop enforcing this rule. But after a sufficiently long history of seeing this being enforced in the longest chain of valid blocks, a user could be fairly confident that such a pattern will continue to hold.

I suppose then you're gonna say that some nodes would see transaction A first, and others would see transaction B first, due to unpredictable network propagation. But since transactions generally reach at least 90% of all nodes within 5 to 10 seconds, you could say that any transaction within a window of 10 seconds from the first transaction is valid.\n\nThis would mean that as long as a merchant waits 10 seconds after seeing the transaction achieve 90% propagation, it can be considered safe and not double-spendable after that. The only way you could replace a transaction after it has achieved 90% propagation is to replace it with one that doesn't change or modify the ouputs.": 1, 'Okay, so why do we need bitcoin or blockchains at all then? Why not just use that system? ': 1, "I don't see how implementing this idea could be a bad thing. It only adds an additional layer of protection onto what is already there.": 1, 'Okay, I agree that every node sees transactions in a different way, so you cannot agree on "seen order" to a very high accuracy. However, nodes should be able to agree on "seen order" to within 30 seconds accuracy (due to statistical average propagation speed). So for example:\n\nNode1: sees txA at 23:00:00 UTC\nNode2: sees txB at 23:00:05 UTC\nNode2: sees txA at 23:00:25 UTC\nNode1: sees txB at 23:00:29 UTC\n\nAt this stage both nodes could agree that either txA or txB are valid (even if they have different outputs from each other), and would choose to mine the one with the highest fee. They can agree on this because for each miner, even if they had different clocks in different time zones, the time between receiving the two transactions was less than 30s. For Node1 it was 29s and for Node2 it was 20s. They wouldn\'t be able to agree on the order of the transactions, but that doesn\'t matter here.\n\nNow if a little bit later both nodes see a third transaction:\n\nNode1: sees txC at 23:00:35 UTC\nNode2: sees txC at 23:00:40 UTC\n\nAt this stage both nodes can agree that txC was seen after txA and txB, because both of them can see that the time elapsed between receiving the first tx and the last tx was greater than 30s. Now if both nodes agree on a consensus rule here that txC may only add an input, and not change outputs, it allows users to fix "stuck" transactions while at the same time preventing double spends of unconfirmed transactions that have been seen for longer than 30s.\n\nFrom what I understand, transactions typically reach 90% of nodes within 5 to 10 seconds, so waiting 30 seconds is quite a conservative value to use to be "extra sure".\n\nIf the nodes disagree on enforcing this as a consensus rule then there would be a fork, and then may the best side win. I think it should be in every miner\'s best interest to enhance the protection against double spending of unconfirmed transactions in this way, as it would increase confidence in the network and enable use cases that rely on zero confirmation transactions being at least partially trustworthy (such as in a coffee shop). This would be positive for the price and longevity of the network.\n\nWithout this, I would have to wait in line at the cashier for 10 minutes for every point of sale purchase I make, which seriously reduces the utility of bitcoin, which would also be bad for miners.\n\nWith the current Opt-in-Full-RBF in Core, I can guarantee that wallets will be developed which make double spending transactions trivial, people will start using them, and that will instantly lead to a lot of bad press that we can\'t afford right now and would seriously harm the prospects of bitcoin becoming mainstream.\n\nThe convenience of "simply reducing your change output" is not worth destroying the viability of accepting zero confirmation transactions.': 0, 'The whole "90% reach within 10 seconds" (whether this is true or not, I didn\'t check) applies only for NON-doublespends. When double spending is happening, you will only ever see one of them.\n\nTrying to "fix" this is just a waste of time, since Lightning provides instant confirmation.': 2, "It can't be a rule because different nodes shall receive transactions in different order.

But I think you\'re talking about a different kind of double spending now. You\'re talking about the kind of double spend where the attacker sends the double spend only to a colluding "bad" miner, in which case the likelyhood of success is limited by the hashrate of that miner/pool. Of course there will never be a way to entirely prevent that kind of double spend attack. The best defense against that type of attack is to ensure that mining never becomes too centralized and that no mining pool ever becomes "too big".\n\nThe kind of double spending I was talking about is the one where the attacker simply broadcasts another transaction to the whole network, but with a higher fee. If we can measure and determine a reliable metric for how long a transaction takes to propogate to 90% of the network, then I think my proposal is still worth considering.\n\nOf course Lightning is still a brilliant idea that should be worked on, but I don\'t see why we shouldn\'t try to make the underlying settlement layer (Bitcoin) as safe as possible without it. IIRC another problem with Lightning that nobody seems to be too worried about is that you need to "freeze" or "bond" some of your money away in one or more (probably many) payment channels for it to be useful and not everyone will have the requisite cashflow to be able to afford that.': 0, 'Yes, a greedy miner could choose to ignore this consensus rule and include the double spend transaction instead in order to claim a higher fee, but as long as they remain in the minority, then the honest side of the fork would remain the longest.\n\nEdit: Spelling': 1, 'Bitcoin uses a Proof-of-Work for distributed consensus, which is the mechanism by which the double spend problem was solved.

Nevertheless, the fundamentals, development, & market acceptance will ultimately determine whether or not I am a winner (i.e., if Bitcoin goes to $50,000 each and Monero is worth $500 or even eventually overtakes Bitcoin then that\'s cool too, and is a "bi-winning" scenario for both Monero & Bitcoin "hodlers" lol).\n\n3) Not sure if I will "give up" on Monero based on its price since good things can be undervalued for a long time before being recognized by the market (i.e., I plan to continue buying even if it drops).

Customers aren't going to want to wait around for 10+ minutes, so you might just have to accept the risk that someone might try to double spend what they paid you with a higher transaction fee to have it processed sooner, cheating you out of the transaction.\n\nEDIT: Looks like someone did something like this for their pub's POS.

An OB store that hosts lots of people's product is a OB version of Etsy or Ebay. OB is a p2p version of http which is already a distributed/decentralized system. If you don't understand why Ebay is making you pay for access to the network they have built, then you will be very confused when your project fails. If any store achieved scale in OB, I guarantee, they would charge people to sell on that site, because... it costs money to both maintain network and build it in the first place.

You could take down nearly all the node operators, and your access to Bitcoin and its entire transaction history would be completely uncompromised. Moreover, you could simply connect to a peer and get that entire transaction history yourself if you were worried about it being shut down. In OB, if an user\'s "store" is shut down, the content can no longer be accessed. This is trivially censorable.\n\nSeriously guys, we spent years talking about how the efficiency of Bitcoin is that it is not censorable. Censorable by whom? Did you think we were saying it isn\'t censorable by Theymos? Or did you think that we were saying it isn\'t censorable by the government. Because if it\'s trivially censored by governments, it\'s censorable. And that is what OB is.\n\n> The Silk Road was able to be shut down because it physically existed in one location.\n\nEvery store on the OB network persists in one location. It is on your node. That is it. So if it were for drugs, all that would mean is that every store owner is another Ross Ulbricht. The risk of being the marketplace owner is lifetime in prison. If you want to gain from network effect, you will find, very soon, that people will start to make destination stores on OB - much like Amazon. I\'m telling you, OB will never get big enough to see that, but it\'s absurd that you would think that the great invention here is that everyone can keep running their own store. It will very quickly, if it gets any scale, start to look just like the web. Lots of individual stores, a few megastores like Amazon. Good luck. And just like Amazon, if the government wanted to shut it down, it could.\n\nYou need to realize that OB is distributed like the internet. But the stores themselves are not distributed. So what you have is a distributed network (like http) that connects to individual stores (like websites). OB is programmed in UDP, not I2P. It is not able to be put behind tor with ease or speed.\n\nFinally, centralization is not "superior to centralized models" except in cases where the externality you are dealing with is burdensome regulation. This means that these stores will only find efficiency if they are selling goods that you couldn\'t otherwise buy through centralized means easily. So... my guess is that New Hampshirites will start to buy all their Raw Milk on OB.
