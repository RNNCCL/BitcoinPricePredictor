Whether or not this is using a tactical nuke to hammer a nail, I can't tell.\n\nBut also - they see the embedded mining as making various costs of using the device completely transparent - they'll all reduce down to an available resource like available cpu - i.e. mined satoshi.  It's this latter part I just don't get...  What other device resource loses power when more and more devices connect - i.e. the difficulty scaling in bitcoin mining?  What if the difficulty goes so high that my embedded chip renders my device unable to perform these applications because I'm no longer mining enough satoshi?

Alternatively, we can run numbers the phone is only mining when it\'s plugged in.  \n\n* Qualcomm Quick Charge 2.0 passes up to 3A @ 12V or 36W, far greater than typical chargers which do [1A @ 5V = 5W](https://www.qualcomm.com/products/snapdragon/quick-charge). Running off charger power alone for 12 hours a day (plug it in when you get home from work / overnight), the phone will mine [0.00084302 BTC a day](http://www.coinwarz.com/calculators/bitcoin-mining-calculator/?h=163.63&p=36&pc=0.10&pf=0.00&d=48807487244.68140000&r=25.00000000&er=234.52000000&hc=0.00). This is about 20 cents, with electricity costs at 5 cents.\n\n* 21\'s mining model is [25%-75% split](http://www.coindesk.com/21-intel-bitcoin-mining-strategy/). Running off a complete battery charge yields 1/8th of a penny of income for your smartphone (worthless), whereas a 12-hour on-charger mining stretch yields 5 cents for your smart phone ...at the cost of 5 cents of electricity. \n\n* Seeing as how the amount of coins mined is utterly insignificant, how does it amount to any meaningful sum worth using or billing for? 5 cents a day * 30 days is $1.50 of microtx\'d calls or cellular data a month. What is that, 30 minutes of calls, 10MB of data? T-mobile charges [$3/mo for 30 minutes of calls alone](http://prepaid-phones.t-mobile.com/pay-as-you-go)\n\n* Accordingly, how do these insignificantly amounts come close to recovering cost of subsidizing these devices? If $1.50 is mining revenue a month for end user, then 21 receives $4.50. Let\'s say it costs $50 to manufacture one of these "cheap" phones that have Qualcomm quick charge and one of the fancy mining chips inside. It\'ll cost damn near a year of faithful charge-mining to break even alone on that cost. Nevermind what happens within a year to mining difficulty.\n\nNone of this is anything remotely sensible to a business model. \n\nMaybe we should move onto the numbers for 24/7 appliances to turn into electricity hogs.': 3, "And yet, this kind of scheme is precisely how most smartphone sales are undertaken today. Very few people actually pay up front for their iphones or Samsungs. They pay cheap up front, in exchange for committing to pay monthly bills. In fact, this credit thing is how most capital goods are paid for in modern societies. Homes, cars, washing machines, laptops and smartphones. People love to spend future money now. This 21 thing is very much the same principle.

I bet they are building a software stack around this too.  I bet they are also including a mining chip, but the play isn't to compete cost effectively, it's either to create really friendly mining software to standardize the transaction confirmation rules to bring down confirmation times de facto, or to create a network of nodes/pools/mining operations that observe certain rules that support micropayments and other types of functionality.\n\nThe last one has to be handled delicately or they could end up drawing the wrath of the bitcoin community.
