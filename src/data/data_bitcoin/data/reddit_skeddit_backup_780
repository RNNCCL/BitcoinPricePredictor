There is no backing for bitcoin because there is no need for it to be backed. It is a decentralized form of value transfer. A value that will always be able to propagate globally at any point in time needs no strict backing, as backing implies there is a force behind it. With bitcoin, the force is negligible because anyone with a copy of the ledger can validate a value transfer. The ones who can validate it first get a small reward, but the reward is only the ability to move more value amongst the network. People will argue "there is no intrinsic value." Please, what causes intrinsic value of gold? Aesthetics? A limited supply? There is no intrinsic value in anything except bitcoin, as bitcoin is fundamentally designed  to be a value transfer protocol where none of its value can be artificially inflated or counterfeit. This means that once you have them, nobody can take them if you lock them up properly. What could be more valuable than something you can trade to others that can never be taken from you by force, that is, if anybody even knows you have them?\n\nTL;DR \nBitcoiners gonna bitcoin, no stoppin us now\n\nEdit.

You can\'t just redeem a dollar for one can of whoopass. So when people say "fiat currencies are backed by force", they\'re using a much less precise definition, something more along the lines of "fiat currencies derive their value from the threat of force by their issuing government".\n\nSpecifically, the issuing government demands tax payments from anyone who engages in trade or owns property within that government\'s claimed territory, and demands that those payments be made with that government\'s currency. Anyone who refuses will have their property forcibly seized, as well as possibly being beaten, jailed, or killed. In practice, this has usually been sufficient to create demand for fiat currencies, giving them enough value to act as a usable medium of exchange.\n\nWhen skeptics say that "bitcoins aren\'t backed by anything", they\'re using the same definition of "backed by" as in "fiat currencies are backed by force". They\'re saying that there\'s no mechanism by which bitcoins can gain the initial value needed to be used as a medium of exchange. They of course have to ignore the fact that bitcoins have been successfully used as a medium of exchange for several years, by hundreds of thousands (if not millions) of people, and in the meantime their value has climbed rapidly. The skeptics see this as some kind of mass delusion-fueled fluke, and expect that bitcoins will lose all of their value just as soon as everyone comes to their senses.\n\nSo what did give bitcoins their initial value, though? While it may not be the only mechanism in play, one that\'s been identified is that Bitcoin (the system) is a unique payment system with some extremely useful features:\n\n* Value can be transfered quickly over great distances via a communications channel\n* The system is global; payments can be made to any account holder, regardless of national borders or political situations\n* It is highly censorship-resistant; there is no mechanism within the system to block payments or freeze accounts, and there is no central entity that can be targeted to shut down or corrupt the system\n* Payments can be made with a high degree of privacy; there is no need for payer or payee to identify themselves\n* If secured properly, accounts are highly theft-resistant; it is much harder to steal well-secured bitcoins than to steal cash or gold\n* Payments are non-reversible once settled; settlement occurs quickly (compared to established systems)\n* Transaction costs are low (compared to established systems)\n\nHowever, the Bitcoin payment system only allows transactions to be made with units of its native currency, bitcoins (note the lowercase). In order to benefit from any of the aforementioned features, one has to first acquire bitcoins. Even before the infamous "Bitcoin Pizza" transaction, early speculators saw the potential of this system (or maybe just blindly gambled on it), began buying bitcoins (using Paypal, cash in the mail, etc) from others who had mined them. These buyers gave the coins their initial value, making it feasible to trade them for other valuable goods.': 2}, ('Prove you are Brazilian and I will send you the tips I got :)', 16): {'[deleted]': 1, 'Moro num pa\xc3\xads tropical / Aben\xc3\xa7oado por Deus / E bonito por natureza.\n\nThat was how Brazilians used to identify themselves in the past. @hgfernan no Twitter. 8-)': 2, 'The Bitcoin tip for 1 sacol\xc3\xa9 (1,023 bits/$0.35) has been collected by *AdrianoOliveira*.\n\n\n[ChangeTip info](https://www.changetip.com/tip-online/reddit) | [ChangeTip video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AnfKpypMNw) | /r/Bitcoin': 1, 'My brand new four month old niece is half-Brazilian, does that count?': 1, 'The Bitcoin tip for 300 bits ($0.10) has been collected by *tiercel*.\n\n\n[ChangeTip info](https://www.changetip.com/tip-online/reddit) | [ChangeTip video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AnfKpypMNw) | /r/Bitcoin': 1, 'It counts ;) 1 sacol\xc3\xa9 /u/changetip': 1, '/u/bitcoinusuario, duduqa wants to send you a Bitcoin tip for 750 bits ($0.26).
