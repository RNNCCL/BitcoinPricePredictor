Here's a variation you can use to minimize the USB risks:\n\n0. Install Tails onto a DVD to avoid even booting through USB. This means you're only using USB to store a master public key and transactions.\n1. Only use a USB drive that you bought and unpackaged yourself. Never use a drive obtained from a third party. Never use your USB drive with another computer.\n2. Create your unsigned transactions from Tails in online mode. This uses Tor, which hides your real IP address from the server - a privacy bonus.\n3. Reboot into Tails in offline mode to sign the transaction.\n4. Reboot into Tails in online mode to publish the transaction.\n\nIn other words, your online and offline computers are the same computer. The online mode uses Tails with an internet connection. The offline mode uses Tails without an internet connection.\n\nThe threats you face are that an attacker can use badusb to get ahold of your seed, execute a man-in-the-middle that changes a payment address, drops a change output so you pay a huge miner fee, etc.\n\nHowever, this is unlikely to happen using the system described here. You'll only ever use the USB drive within a Tails instance. That means you start a fresh OS from DVD every time you insert the USB stick into your computer.\n\nThe only way to install a badusb exploit on the USB drive is to download it while running an online Tails session. You won't be browsing random sites in this session, if at all. This only leaves the Electrum server itself and Electrum as an attack vector. Always possible, but not very likely. If Electrum itself is compromised, no amount of security on your end can fix it.\n\nThere is one possibility that this system can't protect you from. The video mentions badusb infecting built-in USB devices, such as a keyboard or camera.\n\nIf your hardware is infected this way, then Bitcoin security is the least of your problems.\n\nThe ultimate countermeasure in this case is to buy a brand new computer with a DVD drive and use it for online/offline Tails sessions.\n\nBeyond this, we get into the realm of tinfoil hats.\n": 1, "I don't think you understand cold storage.

She had no clue, it was the first she heard of it. She was from the islands off of Ecuador but recently moved to the mountain area.': 3, '*Edit: Update: Seems like the Ecuador central bank currently does this with USD which they don\'t issue themselves. My answer was already assuming the next step - when Ecuador central bank does the same with a new sef-issued money.*\n\nThis money is "real money" ,i.e. "central bank money" (M0 money supply), unlike bank deposits ("M1-M0" money supply in technical terms).\n\n1.) About today\'s traditional bank deposits:\n\nToday, a positive balance in your bank account at a private bank means that there is a liability of the bank to pay you this amount in cash. Unfortunately, due to the fractional reserve system, only a small fraction of this money is backed by real cash - that\'s why there is always the danger of a bank run in our today\'s money system: If all people suddenly decide to withdraw their money, every(!) bank would go bankrupt (also those with very healthy balance sheets). This is the case for virtually ANY bank in the world. This lies in the way the banking system itself works. So today\'s traditional bank deposites are NOT "real money" like cash, but only liabilities (i.e. IOUs - the private bank owes you this amount of cash)!\n\n\n2.) About the new digital money:\n\nNow, the new accounts are bank accounts that people have at the CENTRAL BANK, not a private bank! You need to understand the role of central banks, private banks, and how the fiat money system works, to understand that this is macro-economically a really fundamental difference:\nThe central bank itself is the issuer of physical cash (=real money "M0"), and the new digital bank accounts at the central bank are also holding "real money" (M0). The central bank does not run a fractional reserve system (that\'s the definition of central bank, the central bank gives credits to private banks, not to companies or people; if it ran a fractional reserve system, it wouldn\'t be a central bank any more). So every dollar (or whatever the monetary unit) in the digital new central bank account is backed 1:1 by physical cash, it is real money (M0) just as much as paper cash. By definition of how this works, a bank run is *impossible*, i.e. if all people decided to exchange their central bank electronic money for paper cash - no problem - it can be done - because it is the same thing by definition.\n\nParadigm change:\n\nIf more and more parts of the economy (people, companies) adopt this digital central bank money for daily business, it means that there is more and more "full money" around, and less and less fractionally backed money in accounts of the private banking sector. This has pros and cons. A PRO is that there is no risk of de-stabilization of the system and crash of banks by bank-runs. The CON is that this money does not circulate in the economy while it is held in the people\'s bank accounts at the central bank. Note that this is fundamentally different from private banks, where cash deposits are used to give out more credits to the world.\n\nSo, every paper cash dollar that a customer brings to the new central bank\'s digital account is withheld from circulation in the economy in the same way as if the customer put the paper cash underneath the matress. On the other hand, if the customer brings the 1 dollar to a private bank, the private bank can use this to give out credits. Depending on the fractional reserve rate (e.g. USA 10%, EU 1% [was 2% until 17 January 2012]), each such Dollar (or Euro) can be used to give out credits at a value of much more than just  one Dollar (US: 10$, EU: 100$, in this example), which increases the "M1" money supply in the economy! So there is a built-in LEVERAGE in money supply (M1) w.r.t. what central bank issues (M0) and what actually ends up to be in circulation (M1).\n\nSo, macro-economically, there is a huge difference. The step of introducing this sort of money (electronic "real money M0" for everyone, not only for private banks like until now) can perhaps be seen as a first step of a longer plan of abandoning the fractional reserve banking system altogether in Ecquador.': 8, "As of yet they are not promoting it. They told me that they have plans for a major promotional push later this year (I don't know when) and as I said earlier, this government very effectively communicates its messages when they want to. Not sure if they will incentivize it's use with discounts etc.  ": 1, "A lot of people I asked hadn't heard of it either. Though the government has a very powerful propaganda machine so I'm sure that whenever they decide they want everyone to know about it, they will. ": 6, 'OK, point taken.  It is however still quite different from "new digital currency", as it has often been called in the media.': 1, 'No. You are making a fundamental mistake: the central bank of Ecuador does not issue any money; they use the US dollar. \n\nThese new "digital dollars" might or might not be backed by real M0 dollars. Most likely, only a fraction will be.': 3, 'Technically, it is fundamentally different from PayPal.\n\nIt is central bank money (compare: "M0 money supply") in a digital/electronic form for everyone. Up to now, the only M0 money (central bank money) that is for everyone\'s use is cash, whereas electronic (or digital) central bank money only exists in the from of "bank accounts" that private banks have at the central bank. If a normal person or company wants to have "real" central bank money in another form than cash, it is just not possible until now. If you bring your cash to a private bank, you exchange the real money ("M0", or "central bank money") for a liability (IOU) of the private bank to pay you this amount as cash. So why would you do that? Because cash can be physically stolen or get burnt in a fire, and also banks give some (tiny?) interest. Disadvantage are risks of bank runs or something like "Cyprus 2013".\n\nSince today, every Ecquadorian has the posibility to possess real "M0" money in electronic form.\n\nThe payment aspect is just another side-aspect. Of course, if somebody has a central bank money account for this money, it makes sense to develop a smartphone app for easy online banking and transfer (or "payment") of this money from one such account to anohter, and it makes sense to provide tool like point-of-sale software for merchants, or APIs for websites, to support payments from/to these new accounts.\n\nBut all this is about central bank money, which is different from Paypal, which opoerates on the traditional digital  "IOU money" of the private banking system.\n\n*Edit: Seems like the central bank currently does this with USD which they don\'t issue themselfes. My answer was already assuming the next step - then ecuador central bank does the same with a new sef-issued money.*': 13, 'Great post.

He is a lawyer, very interested in cryptocurrencies and securities, and he has got me doing some research on the future economics of Bitcoin.  \n\nI also happen to have studied and followed Ecuador\xe2\x80\x99s economy for decades now, even lived there for a few years, getting to know Mr. Correa.  \n\nI liked the article in the Guardian (congratulations), and some of the discussion.  But there are some points that are not being fully understood, particularly on how Ecuador\xe2\x80\x99s electronic money relates to crypto (or digital) currencies.  They are actually on the opposite ends of the spectrum.\n  \nEcuador\xe2\x80\x99s electronic money is fully controlled, even administered, by the Central Bank, using a centralized ledger.  It is essentially now a state monopoly in the electronic transactions space. There are all types of limitations, even on the amount of individual daily transactions.   It is backed by, and can be convertible into, US dollars that will be deposited in the Central Bank.  \n\nBitcoin, on the other hand, is a decentralized system, with its own digital currency, not backed by any other asset.  The blockchain is available to all nodes, and has incredible innovation potential.  It is not limited to pre registered participants using electronic equipment; it is in fact a system for peer to peer transactions, where a peer can be an electronic node.  It is a totally different concept. \n\nTwo interesting points raised in earlier comments that should be clarified.   First, the electronic money is fully convertible into US dollars, at parity (1:1).  The key issue is whether that parity will be maintained.  For many years, President Correa has been against the dollarization, but has been unable to change it.  The electronic money could be a vehicle to undo the dollarization, if the parity is broken.  But, it is doubtful that would happen in the foreseeable future.     \n\nSecond, all dollars used to open an electronic money account in Ecuador will be deposited in the Central Bank.  Yes, the $$ leave the banking system and become an asset of the Central Bank (with a corresponding liability in the form of the electronic money).  So, you can say that the Central Bank will now be in direct competition with the rest of the banking system, as the electronic transactions increase.\n\nThe key issue is how will the Central Bank manage its assets or how will they employ those dollars, received when people open an electronic account.  If they hold them in the form of actual currency, then it is easy to understand how the electronic money is fully backed.  But, if the Central Bank lends those dollars, let us say to the Social Security system, then the backing of the electronic money becomes the ability of the Central Bank to collect from the social security system (or any of its borrowers).  \n\nThere is a lot more to this interesting introduction of centralized electronic money in Ecuador.

Some of them are conveniently comparing their online margins with Western Union\'s offline margins to showcase a huge savings.
