By default, for US customers, your balances are held in USD and stored in an FDIC insured bank account.  You can also go into the app settings and change your currency to BTC.

No. Despite even a catastrophic result from raising the blocksize limit, I believe Bitcoin has the power to fix the error and rise again. Hopefully, reguardless of the path chosen, we can come back together as a community focused on making money a sovereign right once again.\n\nNOTE: Im not putting anyone down for having a different opinion than me. ': 1, 'I strongly believe it is': 1, 'Yea but does that "money" do everything? Or just operate as a currency? What about stocks? What about markets? Humans by nature want to simplify everything, but that doesn\'t mean everything can simplified as much as we hope... so where does that all come into play with this whole "We only need Bitcoin" theme I keep seeing.\n\nDid we only need Gold? Silver? Rice? No because all of these had their pros and cons and Bitcoin will be no different in my opinion, just cause it\'s programming doesn\'t mean it will be perfect. I don\'t see how Bitcoin can cover all the markets, stocks and currencies of the world in one little clean and tidy downloadable network. Lets be realistic please.. Bitcoin is going to need helpers to do these things aka "altcoins". And don\'t even start with side chains please.\n\nBut the guy does make plenty of good points about buying and selling of goods and I tend to agree with him there.': 1, 'Are you so sure about the adaptability and anti-fragility in the light of the current blocksize debacle? ': 1, 'You see bitcoin has a thing called the network effect which means that a thing with less users than the nintendo virtual boy will last forever for some reason. ': 0, 'The value added by Bitcoin is so great, and it has such a far lead ahead of all of the other cryptos that right now it is clearly the winner.\n\nThat combined with the adaptability and anti-fragility means that even if someone wanted to destroy it, they probably couldnt': 2, "All the altcoins provide no advantage over Bitcoin that can't be done with Bitcoin itself now or in the near future.\n\nWhy split our energy if we can move forward as one to make the world a freer place?": 1, "Wasn't there like iraqi dollars or something before that? I remember early adopters mentioning more than a few times that they looked into other currencies beside Bitcoin, which all died.": 1, "I would never say other alt coins don't have a chance. But if I had the option to bet and put my money on a particular coin I would always put it on bitcoin at this time. \n\nWhy???  Bitcoin  has what we call the network affect it was the first mover into the market and that is where 95% of the companies in the cryptocurrency space are building there products. Someone can build a better Facebook,  the hard part is getting everyone to switch over.  Alot of people complain about the censorship of r/Bitcoin.  Goodluck getting everyone to switch. \n\n": 1, "If it can't get consensus it's probably not good enough.\n\nOr someone can run that feature on a Sidechain later if there is a demand.": 1, 'Best answer:  http://blog.oleganza.com/post/54121516413/the-universe-wants-one-money': 4, 'Do you really think the core scaling roadmap is compatible with network effects accruing solely to bitcoin? ': 1, "I'm not. But I'm so keyed into this world that I'll see the usurper coming.": 2}}}
