Bitcoin requires infinitely more trust than US banking.  If Citibank screws me, I at least have a legal system to turn to.\n\nAs for what bitcoin was designed to address - it\'s a long list of stuff.

Of course bitcoin *could* make changes to improve these issues, but bitcoin has so far failed to.

': 7, 'Settlement in bitcoin takes 10 minutes when blocks aren\'t full.  There\'s nothing to prevent a spam attacker from filling up blocks with spam as has happened a few times now.\n\nYour example of decentralization in action only seems to occur when one mining pool exceeds 35%+ of hashing power.  People complain about how US banks are "too big to fail" but they\'re nothing compared to the centralization in bitcoin mining.  I\'ll say it again.  Bitcoin is much more centralized than banking and much more brittle.': 1, '>First, the "lack of trust" idea with bitcoin is just wrong. For large parts of 2014, the majority of hashing power was controlled by just 2 pools. Even today, the majority of hashing power was able to sit on a single panel at the recent scaling conference. We are all trusting 3-4 miners with the entire bitcoin network. And currently, they\'re all in China, not even subject to US court systems. These miners could decide to do whatever they want, and it would even be legal.\n\n>Call me crazy, but I trust a consortium of banks subject to laws far more than I trust a group of 3 or 4 privately held Chinese banks that can screw us over without even breaking any laws. Bitcoin requires infinitely more trust than US banking. If Citibank screws me, I at least have a legal system to turn to.You completely misunderstand the mining situation if you think that mining pools are equivalent to miners, and then further that these miners are the equivalent of Chinese banks.\n\nSure when you frame the narrative like that I suppose I\'d rather trust US banks over Chinese banks. But that isn\'t remotely the situation.\n\nRemember when Ghash.io approached 50% of the hashrate and began announcing that they would willing attempt to gain greater than 50% of the hashrate? The actual miners decided this wasn\'t acceptable and pointed their machines at other pools. Ghash is tiny now in response to its irresponsible business decisions. That is decentralization in action.\n\n\n>As for what bitcoin was designed to address - it\'s a long list of stuff. Some of that stuff bitcoin does well (like being disinflationary). Other things it does poorly: like being used for cheap and quick transactions. During the spam attack a few months ago I had transactions that sat at zero confirmations for 24+ hours. Of course bitcoin could make changes to improve these issues, but bitcoin has so far failed to. So now there\'s talk of using the lightning network to address this, and the lightning network will be controlled by a single privately held monopoly. Again...I\'d prefer a consortium of banks to a single company setting prices on transactions. \n\nThe fee\'s in bitcoin are still much smaller than CC processing, and bitcoin transactions have the benefit of settling ownership of an asset whereas a CC transaction does nothing of the sort. Settlement in bitcoin takes 10 minutes, your bank doesn\'t settle your CC transactions every 10 minutes. Bitcoin transactions are more comparable to bank settlements than CC transactions, and 3rd party networks, additional layers, on top of the bitcoin settlement layer will be more comparable to CC transactions.\n\n\n>The disinflationary nature of bitcoin (versus fiat) is indeed very attractive in concept. But consider this: over a decade of moderate inflation, the US dollar might lose 50% of its purchasing power. In contrast, we\'ve seen bitcoin lose 70%+ of its purchasing power in a single year. \n\nBut the difference is that the US dollar is designed to lose 2% per year. It is openly declared. Whereas Bitcoin is designed to reign in on inflation. It doesn\'t mean that every year bitcoin is destined to outperform fiat, but if bitcoin has any value in the future its trajectory in the long term is only up. This doesn\'t mean that bitcoin is destined to succeed, just that, if it retains value in the future, it is much more likely to vastly increase than to decrease to a non-zero number.\n\n>You mention that a private ledger can be changed by privileged entities. A private blockchain could be set up so that past entries can\'t be changed by anyone. And future entries of bitcoin can also only be changed by privileged entities. Again, only miners who successfully hash a block get the privilege of making an addition to the blockchain and today it\'s basically a dozen entities who ever have a shot of doing that.\n\nYou are misunderstanding or obfuscating the difference between a privileged ledger and a permission-less ledger. On a privileged ledger, only authorized entities can participate in the act of mining/making an addition to the blockchain.\n\nOn a permission less ledger anyone, anywhere can participate in making an addition to the blockchain. You can even manually enter hashes and hope to get lucky! \n\nAnd again, a single mining pool often represents many, many miners. In the past, miners have demonstrated their ability to decentralize from pools that get too large. It seems the trend continues.\n\n\n\n\n\n': 1, 'Sure, unless banks invent bitcoin IOUs the same as they did with gold (this is pretty much what the lightning network, or Ripple, or Stellar, does).

They basically sell a service of confirmation and they have some fixed costs (hardware) and variable costs (electricity, rent), well and both those costs basically don't depend on how many transactions you include in the block. So I think another example might be more fitting here - wholesale price vs. retail price. If you sell something in big quantity - you can give discount to buyer, this is how it works as you get bigger volume and better turn over.

(In absence of a software hard limit, nodes choose what acceptable size they will relay and add to their chains)\n\nIf enough of them reject a block of inappropriate size then that block likelihood of being orphaned increases. \n\nBut of course if this happened miners may start using the relay network to tell each other of new blocks and going around the economic majority.  In that case we would need to rely on the fact that a miner wishing to sell their mining load will have problems transacting with an exchange which did not recognize their chain as the longest. \n\nTherefore a miner breaking from the consensus of the network would find it harder to operate, giving nodes some what of a veto power over the power of miners. ': 1, 'I see that as a complimentary to the current possibility of parties "buying votes" by paying miners to filter out transactions or buying their hashpower.  If anything, it levels out the playing field.\n\nAt the end of the day, miners are doing nothing more than throwing money into a void to secure bitcoin (and guarantee consensus) if you subscribe to the notion that how they effectively do so is largely irrelevant, then does it matter whether they are burning money in the form of power or rent costs or bribery?\n': 2, "But that's not how mining works. Relay restrictions aren't consensus rules, they are just incidental network topography. ": 1, 'Good paper. \nI believe they are right. Though perhaps we need not stop the propagation of blocks that we don\'t "vote" for, only deprioritze their transmission over ones that we as a node support. \nPerhaps instead of just an INV a version number was also sent to listening nodes. That way nodes can be selective and prioritize the blocks they ask for without being oblivious to their existence. (And falling prey to the problems the paper spoke to)\n': 1, 'I\'ll agree to that. \n\nBut the problem now is that while the economic majority may want more transactions per sec or bigger blocks, they cannot exert any economic pressure onto the miners that would make them lose money. \n\nWith a way to filter blocks (which presumably won\'t be used often), the economic majority may have that necessary veto power over a bad actor miner, which gives me the belief that we could safely drop artificial block limits completely, and let free markets decide. \n\nAt the very least it puts a somewhat unknown cost to attacking the network (non mining nodes) by causing large storage implications for everyone at the miners own expense. (Say, if a three letter agency decided to start mining but do it in order to have an effect on the stability of the network). \n\nYes it will be a game akin to Wall Street HFTs.  Nodes with better connectivity would have more weight to their veto power.  But keep in mind there is an economic limit to bandwidth so it is not free, and the market forces that would drive nodes to improve their bandwidth in order to have their veto power weighted more is a positive virtuous cycle. \n\nIn all honesty I don\'t know all the ways that this could be manipulated, but it seems to me that in the worse case scenario we would end up with the system we have currently, simply by allowing nodes to set a priority of block versions that they will relay.  Let\'s assume that block versions were secure (and that creating one with Bitcoin version A could not be forged by Bitcoin version B) then a node could say, relay A blocks with no delay while penalizing every other version with a delay. \n\nThe penalty setting would only effect the ability of the node to relay the block by adding an intentional delay to answering a peers request for getdata. It doesn\'t mean that the node will not store the current block that they have heard about nor does it mean that a node can flat out deny the blocks existence.  The time to delay the block transmission can be tuned to match a fraction of the average time between the last 100 blocks or something, the intent is to delay this "unwanted" block version so that a competing version of block has a good chance to be found in the meantime. \n\nIn the worse case where the economic majority is split 50/50 over which version it prefers then the network block time will effectively double (with each side delaying the other sides blocks) which will slow the network for a while until a clear miner majority of block version is agreed upon. (Determined by block version the nodes with the most convectively prefer)\n\n\nDoes this make a hard fork more clunky? Yes. But in the current scenario where hard forks are decided upon by less than 10 people in the world who run 90% of the hash power, the cost in efficiency loss of a hard fork to converge on a decision is outweighed by the fact that the economic majority can have a say at the table.  The alternative is to just hope that all major nodes start mining themselves, which is a tough solution give that will put economic demands of a payment processor above and beyond the capital needed to run a pure mining operation. (Which implies they will never be able to have as much hash power as a pure mining op)\n\nJust a rough idea at this point. But if you think it has merit I will work on it and propose it to the dev list. \n\n': 1, "I agree with the fact that forks are the best way to express a free market opinion on the ruleset of the network.  The issue is that for a lone solo (non-mining) node, we don't get to vote in a hard fork --unless-- we have this mechanism of block selection which will allow each of us to 'ratify' the miner vote, in a sense.\n\nI make the assumption that miners that contribute their hash to a pool don't care too much about their vote -- which I think is a valid assumption given that they don't care enough to run their own node anyway. \n\nIn this system, miners vote by creating blocks supporting a particular version of Bitcoin, nodes ratify the votes by prioritizing relaying of the blocks to the ones that they vote for, and pool hashers give up both rights to vote or ratify.  \n\nI'm not sure if sybil attacks on nodes would be a problem, given the _power_ of a node in its ability to ratify is determined by its connectivity in the network topology, (with nodes like coinbase and bitpay having bigger representation, due to the number of users which they proxy for).\n\nI do realize that this is somewhat different from the network in which Satoshi envisioned where propagation of blocks through the P2P network is unfettered and unencumbered (and for every new suggestion there is bound to be someone who will quote Satoshi's 'original view') but to answer that criticism, Satoshi also probably didn't foresee the separation of mining from nodes in the first place, so we are already in uncharted waters in terms of incentive alignments and a tweak to level the balance of powers may be needed.": 1, 'Also, keep in mind that nodes can only filter on block version. Not the miner that mined it. The point is not to allow for censorship. The point is to show preference/support for a particular consensus rule set (say one that allowed a bigger blocksize or a certain OP code etc)': 1, "and while we are on the topic of differences, currently there are about 10 votes you need to buy to own all the hash power on the network (give or take some flex given pool user slippage)\nIf you wanted to 'buy votes' of the nodes you have at least 4-6k nodes that you would need to buy, and have a good idea of the network topology in order to make sure that you could eclipse the blocks of your competitor.\nIts quite a feat, akin to trying to successfully double spend": 1, "By the same argument that you trust miners not to collide to destroy the network they rely on, giving nodes a say in the game doesn't change the economic reasons why people will want to help the network not hurt it. ": 1, "Or you realize that maybe you are mining on a minority fork, and it is starting to hurt your orphan rate and thus bottom line, and you are compelled as a miner to join the majority.  I see this as a 'soft' solution to the problem of a contentious hard fork. (which would be needed in the situation where the network is actively being co-opted by aggressors.)": 1, "> Satoshi also probably didn't foresee the separation of mining from nodes in the first place\n\nYeah that's what I meant by non-mining nodes being a strange thing.\n\nWIth node ratifying, doesn't it just become a game of which implementation can find the fastest path through the collection of nodes accepting its blocks? It's unclear to me how that would work out, because any nodes that were slow or topologically near the edges of the network graph would have very little say, whereas nodes at pinchpoints near the oceans like New York, LA, Tokyo, etc. with low latency and high speed would matter a lot. Correct?\n\nIt seems like as long as each implementation has plenty of nodes in support of it, the race would come down to some minor factors affecting top speed and highest connectivity, a bit like with high-frequency trading on Wall Street where the game becomes to get your connection to the main hubs as fast as possible. ": 1, "It seems that academics don't agree.\n\n> In  the  case  of  transactions,  stopping  the  propagation  is  a reasonable trade off, that protects the network from transaction spam,  at  the  expense  of  individual  users.  **However,  in  the case  of  blocks,  stopping  the  propagation  is  not  reasonable**.

What you are proposing would break bitcoin. It would eventually boil down to a perpetual fight between miners on whose last block is valid, the orphan rate for everyone would probably skyrocket and cause constant forking slowing down the network while transaction didn't confirm, because blocks kept orphaning constantly, the network would be almost unusable, and the price would probably crash. ": 1, "I would like to see this put into the base node implementation of core, then, after which, I think I will sleep soundly knowing that if any party tries to usurp the network, be it a large group of miners, or developers, or govt, the economic masses have a say in controlling how much their influence can affect the network as a whole.\nI hope that this shouldn't be a contentious change with any of the current competing schools of thought.": 1, "I think there are other problems, but strictly you just need to have the chain that most people are working on.

It needs to happen though (i.e. banks need to experiment, push the envelope and see where they get to -- it\'s good for the entire ecosystem, even if it is a temp drain on resources).\n\nAs it stands, I think it\'s vapourware anyway. They don\'t have anything yet. They\'re just getting banks to sign agreements that say not much more than, "we\'ll work together", "we\'ll share IP", "we won\'t disclose anything". They\'re right to get the banks onside first but sooner or later they need to show a product.\n\nSome of the big ticket issues are around antitrust and the creation of joint and several liabilities. In my mind, the issues are 10x worse than e.g. perceived regulatory or reputational or technical concerns with using Bitcoin\'s public chain.\n\nThe concept of a share private chain is also fundamentally flawed. Assuming trust from the outset makes securing the network incredibly hard. You have to account for everything from banks that fall out with each other (think 2007 when banks suddenly stopped lending to each other because they simply had no idea who was solvent/insolvent (or perhaps more accurately, which insolvent banks the governments would support)) to employees being compromised or e.g. selling read/write access on the black market. Then there are the myriad regulatory concerns in all the relevant jurisdictions.\n\nTrying to get everyone on the same page and actually launch the thing is also monumentally difficult.\n\nWill be interesting to see where they come out.\n\nI did find it interesting that R3 is part of the initiative recently announced by The Linus Foundation. Does R3 even have a product?': 1, "Well for starters what if you aren't allowed to use R3?  Which most people in the world won't be.  Or if you want to pay someone in a different currency?  Or if you aren't in the US?  Or if some sherriff in Massachusetts decides what you're doing is immoral?  Or you want to keep your wealth in something which won't be inflated by future decisions of people you can't influence?  Or you don't want your payees selling your financial information to someone else?\n\nOr you don't trust the banks who fucked the world over and got away with it and are presumably fucking it over again in some new way we haven't found out yet?\n\nR3 is just the existing system with a bit more efficient internal processes.  It is not a competitor for bitcoin any more than the existing system.\n\nedit: *or what if you actually want to control your own money, rather than depend on the permission of others to use it*": 2, 'I think that you are right that there would be alot of issues for them to overcome but when it comes to the banks and greed I would not put anything past them: They have realised the potential here and will definitively make a worthy effort.\n\nI think getting a product ready today will be the smaller task, I think the details between the banks will be harder. \n\n': 1, 'The benefit is the banks can clear with each other faster.\n\n': 1, "Why wouldn't the R3 solve it as good or better than the blockchain?": 1, 'Banks doing business with each other moving funds can do it faster and verify cheaper.': 1, 'The R3 blockchain token, if it even has one, can be listed somewhere in the middle [here](https://coinmarketcap.com/2)': 1, 'Like it or not, people trust banks, or most people do, they leave their money there and do alot of other important business trough them.\n\nVisa and mastercard is only a small part of the whole thing and I think a sidechain on R3 will solve whatever issues they have, or not who knows.\n\nLedger or not, they see the blockchains potential and do what they always do, secure their positions and block change that would be harmful to them.\n\nPeople on the street will never have any Idea of the difference between permissioned and permissionless blockchains.

Their project is boring as hell.": 2, "The R3 chain won't be a public chain though. It'll be a big intranet that their banking partners alone will be using together. That means the safety of an intranet instead of the blockchain... Lol; that oughtta last long.\n\nAnd even if safety were to be acceptable somehow, being an intranet means there are no actual benefits... Customers would be using the same old fiat in the same old ways, no programmable money, no microtransactions, no borderless innovation, no github filled with 4,000+  developers adding to it whenever they have an idea, basically nothing that anyone likes about bitcoin.\n\nThe two just aren't in competition. At best, R3 is going to lower costs of banks internally without changing what banks can do from the customer's point of view, and frankly that's just not good enough for 2016.": 2, "They would not offer almost everything that the Bitcoin blockchain offers because they don't want to give up control of their network to a decentralized, public system. \n\nSecurity theatre only works when your adversary isn't more powerful than you.

Interbank transfer reconciliations.  Of course Visa and Mastercard could solve that problem too, but a shared ledger cuts them out as middlemen.  \n\nMy question is, how *exactly* does a permissioned, shared replicated ledger work at the technical level?  Bitcoin's permissionless blockchain's core mechanic is that anoymous nodes in a distributed p2p system compete to solve otherwise useless puzzles that in this particular use case serve to secure the system, and in return are awarded a scarce token that may have some value some day.\n\nThat's presumably not needed in a permissionless, non-anonymous ledger though, so what new core mechanic replaces it?  I know research is being done on it in various places, but have any proposals/whitepapers been published yet?": 1, "Most people will have no clue of the difference between BTC and R3 than the difference the marketing and propaganda to them.\nThey just want to do their shit as friktionless as possible while grabbing a beer on the weekend, the do not have the same insight and disdain about the banking system that most people here does.\n\nWhy would people want to use R3? they don't care about R3\nThe banks will use it to make transfers cheaper for them and faster for the customer anyhwere in the world the customer will get most of the blockchain benefits without knowing why.\n\nThe banks will then create regulations that makes sure that use of another blockchain for the same purposes as they use it for will be impossble to comply to unless you are a big bank.\n\nHopefully Bitcoin will continue to exist in the perifery but I am sure the big banks will do everthing in their power to take over all the important functions of it and more. For a fee from the user ofcourse": 1, 'I think they will be in competition, why would they not offer almost everything that the Bitcoin blockchain offers?\n\nThe safety will be the illusion that the consortiums efforts to secure the network will be better and more secure than the miners securing the bitcoin network.\n\nI think they can make it safe enough but as long as the perception of safety for R3 is bigger than for the Blockchain, that is all that matters.\n': 0, 'My question is what problem R3 is solving that visa and mastercard does not solve already ?': 2, '> consortium of trusted established big banks securing the R3 chain\n\nI wonder what established big bank have such international trust.\nCompanies owning a ledger who got the most trust in the previous age were called "Visa" and "Mastercard".
