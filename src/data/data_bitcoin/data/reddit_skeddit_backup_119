I would assume you\'ve now got the answer to why your fees were not estimated correctly and it\'s either that armory wasn\'t able to correctly estimate them (armory\'s fault, not the bitcoin network as a whole nor specifically a block size issue), or perhaps you had it configured incorrectly (same applies).\n\n\n> As for the factual claims made, that the fees for a transaction were in the $10 range which is a complete game changer for bitcoin\n\nYour transaction was, I believe **150x** the size of the average transaction, included many party multi-sig too correct?  Are you suggesting that if the block size was increased that the fees for a transaction such as the one in question would be significantly different?  I don\'t think that has been established as some fees would presumably still be required, certainly for large transactions as the halving is coming.   A 150x average size transaction would still presumably not be free and may still be substantial as the network does need to pay for it\'s own security.  90kb is after all a substantial chunk of even a 2Mb block (~4.5% of it).  So that is the first reason to redact it.\n\nAlso, what would this transaction have cost you at a bank?  Is it even possible?  What are the other possible alternatives and their associated costs?  I don\'t think $6 for what you are doing is a game changer or even remotely unreasonable but I\'d love to hear your perspective on it.  If there are no practical alternates that is a 2nd reason to redact the claims.\n\nMy main beef: your post was alarmist and sensationalist.  You clearly didn\'t know how to estimate fees nor did you pick a wallet (or have it configured correctly) to properly estimate them for you so you over estimated them.  Then you seemingly presented it as if it was a normal transaction, not something incredibly unique and as if the sky was therefore falling: \n\n["Here\'s a transaction with a ten-dollar transaction fee. **This the bitcoin you want? Cause this the bitcoin you have now.** (More in comments)"](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/429ek5/heres_a_transaction_with_a_tendollar_transaction/)\n\nI think the spirit of that post, in light of the discussion, the recent revelations about calculating fees. alternate wallets that do estimate fees better, the specifics of your transaction and your interaction with Armory support, begs a formal redaction or at least clarification.  Considering the /r/btc crowd jumped all over it in their echo chamber I would think you\'d want them and other newcomers to bitcoin to have the most accurate information possible.  It\'s the responsible thing to do to help people more accurately understand this historically important technology especially in light of the very heated and important debate that is and was going on at the time of your post.\n\nI expect posts like yours in /r/btc, but not from someone like you that seems so centered and rational.  Your post could have easily been presented in the form of a question rather than an emotional call to arms and I would have had no problem with it and would have helped to the degree I am equipped to provide help (as I did after first responding in kind).

I other words consumer pays $200 for Devalt drill to use for 15 min.  There is no incentives for Devault to build quality drill, thus the heavy user gets taxed, and subsidies the rest of the production as he needs to buy drills more often.

This is totally wrong; no trust is required. The worst someone can do is make you unable to get your bitcoins back until nLocktime expires.': 2, 'It\'s  not just Bitcoin, but distributed technologies in general.\n\nConsider a "MakerNet" of people who make physical things by collaboration, either manually or electronically.  Let\'s say you want a table.  You obtain the design files from the designer.  This is then sent to the woodworking shop, who in turn sends orders to the lumber yard and hardware supplier.  Payments are via escrowed Bitcoin transactions as each person does their part of the task.  In a fully electronic version, all this is automated once you click on "buy this table", it just shows up a few days layer.\n\nNow extend the MakerNet to cover all kinds of goods and services, and Bitcoin balances move around between network nodes.  People who want to invest in the network can buy shares in automated equipment the same way they buy a table, or buy a whole machine and become one of the operators.  New production machines are built the same way as tables - a buyer sends an order to a manufacturer, who in turn sends orders for parts and materials as needed.\n\nBanks are mostly cut out of this process, because they are just not needed.  Now further transfer ownership of machines as needed on a liquid market.  When I make a piece of furniture for myself in my own basement workshop, there is no income to be taxed.  If I use a Computer controlled (CNC) [router](http://www.multicam.com/images/router/1000classic.jpg) that should not change, neither should it change if the router is somewhere other than my basement.  As long as I own it while I am using it, it doesn\'t get taxed.  Buy it when you need it, sell it off again when you are done.  Construction companies actually do this all the time, but Bitcoin and smart contracts can reduce the overhead for buying and selling, so you can own the router for just the 5 hours you need it to make your table parts (or whatever)\n\nThis not only disrupts banks, but the whole income tax system.  Making things for yourself with automated machines on a small scale may not be as efficient as mass production.  But you are also not paying for stuff with after-tax income after it has been marked up a few times by middlemen, and with interest added on afterwards if you finance it.': 5, '> It is well-understood knowledge that a dollar printed in 1970 does not carry the same value as a dollar printed in 2015.\n\nThat is nonsense, or at least wrongly stated.

This is similar to how normal SPV Bitcoin clients work, but the paper notes that further additional information can be included with the transfer in order to make that process even more robust, but that's just a detail.\n\nIn any case, it is not envisioned that 2-way pegs be used regularly or for small transfers, both because trusting the validity requires waiting a not-insignificant amount of time (perhaps a few days) and because the SPV-proofs are not-insignificant in size (though the whitepaper describes a pretty interesting way to make them quite compact).\n\nInstead, it is intended that large transfers be made, and then people on both sides of the peg can simply trade their coins nearly instantly using an already well-established, robust, trustless method that works *today* across blockchain systems that are not even pegged:\n\n* **the Atomic Swap** (which is also described in the paper).\n\nWhat makes the atomic swap even more useful for pegged blockchains than for non-pegged blockchains is that there is no volatility in price (because the tokens are pegged), which greatly simplifies the market for (*i.e.,* the organizing of) swaps.\n\nGreat.\n\nNow, how does a blockchain system check an SPV proof? Well, a new system created specifically to be a sidechain certainly can be programmed from the start to understand them, but what about Bitcoin, which was designed before the concept of an SPV proof was even developed? There are 2 approaches:\n\n* If (or when) Bitcoin's script language is finally made just slightly more powerful (perhaps even as powerful as it was when Satoshi first released it), then it will be possible to describe the validation process using just Bitcoin's script; that is to say, if the Bitcoin world ever wants even slightly smart contracts, then that implies the Bitcoin world wants to allow for the permissionless creation of symmetric SPV-proof 2-way pegs.\n\n    Such improvements to Bitcoin's script can be introduced with a soft fork.\n\n* Because 2-way pegs are awesome, and are clearly the future of the Internet of Money, it would be silly to require the overhead inherent in describing them with generic Bitcoin script primitives; instead, it makes a lot more sense to build that description directly into Bitcoin by creating a script primitive dedicated to SPV-proof validation.\n\n    Such augmentation to Bitcoin's script can be introduced with a soft fork.\n\nOf course, a soft fork is not quite permissionless to deploy; it requires significant approval from the Bitcoin world, and it's difficult to get that approval unless the correctness of a plan can be demonstrated. Yet, how can there be such a demonstration unless there are implemented sidechains with which real-world value can be experimented? Simple:\n\n* **the Federated Peg**\n\nThe insight here is that any missing functionality in Bitcoin's script processing can already be provided permissionlessly by a third party, *and* that this third party need not be particularly trusted. The paper thus describes what is called a federated peg, which not only can provide arbitrarily distributed trust, but also allows for users in the Bitcoin world to send and receive transactions from others without even realizing that the coins are making their way through a 2-way peg! (It merely appears that coins are being sent through a multisignature address.)\n\nThe federated peg is actually suited to private blockchains that are interesting to a consortium of mutually distrusting organizations (*e.g.,* banks). It's also an excellent way to bootstrap and maintain a minimum degree of security for a sidechain that is ultimately meant to transition to a symmetric SPV-proof 2-way peg in the long term.\n\nHence, using the federated peg will allow for a nascent Internet of Money to begin to develop, proving the worth of sidechains.\n\n**tl;dr:** A 2-way peg can be made arbitrarily secure, can be deployed permissionlessly already, and won't even be an issue for everyday use between \\[important\\] sidechains, anyway.": 3}, ('BitHub Africa\xe2\x80\x99s Founder: \xe2\x80\x98Achieving the Dream of Global Inclusiveness\xe2\x80\x99 with Bitcoin (Exclusive Interview)', 4): {}, ("Can't we do something about ethereum spammers?", 2): {'Is there something going on over there at ethereum thats causing this garbage?

I will add an update to my article to reflect the information you gave me. I was not aware of the $200 gain threshold with currencies. As I said in my article I'm not a tax professional. I just know that treating it as stock for reporting but treating it as currency in usage is blocking adoption for many users I talk to. Whether it benefits from long-term reduced rates or not, the focus appears to be keeping people focused on long-term, slowing the number of transactions, slowing the adoption rate, making it cumbersome to use, and killing adoption quietly.\n\nAnd could you point out exactly what you disagree with in my article? I don't see where I endorsed one over the other, honestly. The fact that I listed them both as options is the first key that I at least find the offerings themselves to be likable to some degree. I tried to be impartial and give an initial impression of them. I listed Libra Tax first simply because I had to choose one with which to start and then the other always gets compared to it. From looking at the offerings, primarily the layouts and wording on the sites, my initial impression stands.\n\nThe Libra Tax front page talks about the tools they offer, their About page with names I can look up on LinkedIn goes straight into what makes their team knowledgeable, and they have a section dedicated to offerings for individuals right at the top under Products. This gives the impression that they know what they are talking about and they give me what I need to do my taxes. One thing I really didn't like, which you were kind enough to point out, is that they don't list prices right on their page... anywhere. That makes me not even want to bother signing up because it usually means it's outrageously expensive. The $19 to $49 price really isn't that bad, to be honest. At least on the surface, anyway. But what that $19 to $49 buys you is the important part.\n\nThe BitcoinTaxes front page does have a link on the front that says Free, which is certainly a selling point. But the front page talks about if you're looking for a tax professional or are a tax professional. Then more about being a tax professional. There is then a list of tools but by now I have the impression that they are for a tax professional to use while they are doing my taxes. Over and over again, down the front page, this is the case. And there is no About page at all. Why should I trust the writers of these tools to be knowledgeable on taxes or Bitcoin? And, to top it off, there is a giant disclaimer at the bottom that I'm potentially getting financial and tax advice from a place that doesn't stand behind their financial and tax advice. Not to mention that there is an entry in the FAQ that BitcoinTax is not a tax prep service and to call the third option I listed, Tyson Cross.\n\n**tl/dr: Libra Tax looks like tax professionals who dabble in Bitcoin writing software tools for individuals. BitcoinTaxes looks like Bitcoin professionals who know software writing tools for tax professionals.**\n\nWhile this may be a case of a mistaken impression, and I'm really truly guessing that it is based on other things I've read about it, it is indeed the impression that is given. But I had to dig up other reviews and screenshots to get past the impression the page gave me. To be much more clear on the subject, I'd like to point out that **what I've written here is not even a finished review. I don't want to give readers some kind of a bad impression of either service at this point.** My regular readers know that my educational articles tend to work off impressions because I simply point out services, features, tools, gadgets, etc. and gloss over them. As is always the case, my educational posts are almost always followed up with in-depth reviews of each service I talk about in the future, with which these impressions can be corrected. And, with tax season rapidly approaching, I do plan on doing a more in-depth review of Libra Tax and Bitcoin Taxes very soon. I really want to try out BitcoinTaxes, as well as Libra Tax, this year. At that time I will write a much more fair review of both services.\n\nAgain, I really like the look of the BitcoinTaxes service and I'm excited to try it out. Thank you for taking the time to read my article and correct me on wrong information. I am open to suggestions and constructive criticism. In that same spirit I hope you take what I've written above as constructive criticism and not some kind of attack on you or your service.": 1, "You compare Bitcoin to foreign currency in your article, but don't mention that fiat has a $200 gain threshold.

You are trusting an (often anonymous) third-party, much like typical fiat banking. So the benefit of running a full node is all the benefits of using Bitcoin: decentralisation, trustless, irreversible, etc.\n\nFurthermore, if the economic majority fail to use full nodes, they are effectively "hard forking" Bitcoin to a completely rule-less system, and the longest mined blockchain, valid or not, becomes Bitcoin.

Note that the concerns against raising the block size *still do apply* with segwit, and miners should therefore soft-cap their blocks below 1 MB even after it is deployed. However, while a hardfork requires consensus, the same is not true of the softfork, so those of us who might be concerned cannot prevent the limit increase via segwit.\n\nLightning only transmits transactions between a subset of the network in most cases, so blocks will be magnitudes smaller.

You can\'t "commit" a zero-confirmation transaction.

Here\'s why: There is *nothing* you can do to prevent a miner from replacing a zero confirmation transaction. You can\'t even force a miner to adhere to RBF rules. Any one of them could download the source and tweak the RBF related code to whatever they want. RBF is simply codifying the most likely choice the miner will make. \n\nIt isn\'t that the devs don\'t understand that people want immediately committed transactions. It\'s that there is no known technical solution to this problem in a decentralized authority system. Furthermore it can be difficult to explain *why* this is, especially to a non-technical person. "Well, it\'s up to the miner." is just going to prompt more questions. RBF is much easier to explain "if you submit two transactions the one with the higher fee is chosen".

The protocol cannot force the miner to choose any transaction over another. RBF, non-RBF whatever. The choice is entirely up to them. As I mentioned in the comment, there is nothing preventing a miner from downloading the latest source and altering the transaction replacement logic to whatever they prefer. Providing any illusion to the contrary, such as opt-in RBF or the "commit" button you\'re suggesting, is completely misleading.\n\nThere is no known approach for immediate confirmation transactions in a decentralized authority cryptocurrency system and discovering a method to do so would be as ground breaking as bitcoin itself. This isn\'t to say I believe it\'s impossible. I\'m just saying it could be another 10 years until someone figures out how to make it work.\n\nIn the mean time, it\'s a fact that the miners make the choice.
