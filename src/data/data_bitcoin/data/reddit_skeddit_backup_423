If a recipient (Bob) misses some transaction hashes, he will request them over existing connections from the same peer and all other peers (however, he most likely have already received all transactions that Alice knows about while she was mining). In case of (a very rare) collision in a 8-byte prefix for one or more transactions, Bob would iterate over all possibilities to reconstruct a matching merkle tree.

Out of laziness, theoretical computer scientists later decided that finding the asymptotic behavior was the end goal of analysis.  \n\nI have seen programmers waste months, or maybe years, because of this vice of theoretical computer scientists.

But while the asymptotic cost of the k-d tree method is O(log n), the logarithmic behavior only starts to apply when n is much larger than 2^d; until then, the k-d tree method ends up looking at almost all n strings, so it is no better than brute force search...': 1, "Given that there is no useful theory for the latter, wouldn't you say it's harder?": 1, 'Fascinating work with Schnorr signatures.': 3, 'With respect to the profession comment.. it is perhaps because the scaling behavior of actual algorithms  is very important to software engineering; but that question doesn\'t really have that much to do practically with Complexity Theory as a mathematical pursuit-- just in the way you relate axiom of choice and chemical engineering. That is one of the reasons why I like talking about NP in terms of probabilistic checkable proofs; which makes the disconnection with concrete problems more clear.\n\nLets narrow the scope to one way functions, instead of all of asymmetric crypto, for a moment. You can think about one way functions just as an abstract mathematical construct. From those you can think of a "signature system" as an abstract mathematical construct.  And define a game, where the attacker wins if he can forge a signature with more than negligible probability, and we assume the attacker and defender have polynomial bounded computation. Can a "signature system" exist where the defender wins against any polynomially bounded attacker?  If the answer is yes then this implies P != NP.   Is this a practical question? No.  It\'s a mathematical abstraction from a practical question, which might or might not tell us anything about practical concerns.  I think many people think of cryptography as something has been nicely solved, so that point that it\'s not possible to make "provably secure" even as a purely theoretical construct without strong assumptions, is pretty interesting; and maybe good cause to go and ask yourself why you believe what you believe. :)\n\n\n': 1, 'Proving a cryptosystem secure is not "harder than solving P vs NP".  The two problems have no relation.  P vs NP is about the asymptotic complexity of  functions on infinite domains, as the arguments tend to infinity.  Cryptosystem security is about concrete complexiy of functions on finite domains. There is no useful theory for the latter.': 2, "Well, thanks for the reply, but I still don't see a connection between asymmetric crypto (or any *practical* computing problem) and asymptotic complexity theory. \n\nAccording to the latter, every function (even the Machine Halting  predicate, even functions that cannot be defined mathematically) can be computed in O(1) time if the domain is restricted to a finite set, even if bigger than the number of atoms in the universe.\n\nThe connection exists only if the practical problem is modeled by a function on an infinite domain; and even then, depending on the extension, the function may be O(1) or uncomputable, or anything in between.\n\nI have come to the conclusion that students in Computer Science courses generally hate Complexity Theory, no matter who teaches it or how, for that reason: teachers tell them that it is fundamental to writing good programs, but the students can fuzzily perceive that it is totally irrelevant.  \n\nIt is as if chemical engineers had a course on the Banach-Tarski paradox, and were told that it was fundamental for their profession since it showed how to make the necesary amount of any substance...\n": 1, 'Yea, my point wasn\'t that proving that asymetric crypto is impossible implies P==NP, but rather, proving it _possible_ implies P != NP, which-- absent a very careful dodge with definitions, it probably would imply. Thats why I was describing cryptography as in some sense harder, privileging P!=NP since basically everyone believes that to be true, and pointing out that we could prove P != NP and still have no idea if our crypto was secure; but if we has some useful scheme for secure asymmetric cryptography we would have shown P!=NP question as a side effect (again, barring definition dodges). \n\nDepends on how you define "public-key cryptography".  There is a broad class, including signatures, which "merely" need one way functions and not a full trapdoor function. There is no proof of the existence of one way functions, and if you can prove one exists then you prove P != NP (but again, P != NP doesn\'t imply one way functions; the relation only goes one way).\n': 1, 'The problem is that Bitcoin\'s reference client has already been implemented and is running the network.

Not the question "is arbitrary system X secure" but "is any useful and secure asymmetric cryptosystem possible _at all_ or can we expect that any will eventually be broken by some smarter algorithm".\n\nWhat we\'d like is to be able to show that, without any strong assumptions, that for your candidate system the attackers work necessarily grows asymptotically faster than the defenders; which requires their tasks to be in different computational classes. Having achieved that, as a matter of engineering we can wax over most uncertainty about constant factors by adding a bit more size to result in a cracking problem which cannot be computed in the physical universe, as we know it.\n\nA more useful definition of NP in the context of computational complexity theory are decision problems which constant size probabilistic checkable proofs that allow deciding them (probabilistic) in polynomial time. A proof that P==NP would show, among other things, that the oracle access to the proof adds no asymtopic speed-up, and that all decision problems was still decidable in time.\n\nMaking it more concrete,  say you have a decision problem like "For parameter X where X is the X-th twin prime, and C is smallest CM discriminant trace 3 elliptic curve with order (lower prime) over field (upper prime), and G is a fixed arbitrarily selected generator of the group, Is least significant bit of the discrete log of H(G) with respect to G zero?" and you can prove that this decision problem cannot be decided by any algorithm (without oracle access) with polynomial time in X, then we you have proven that P != NP _and_ we can use that to build a cryptosystem which is secure without any strong cryptographic assumptions.  I confess may not be completely necessary that this is the case, in that there could be some definition of a assumption free secure cryptosystem which somehow dodges proving that P==NP alone the way-- formally proving otherwise would be quite a result (but would also likely required a very unusual definition). But the questions are more related than you\'re giving credit, much of what we for in establishing strong assumptions for cryptosystems really would imply P!=NP result if they were proven sound.\n\nAnd my goal there was really to just shake people out of thinking that you can just assume cryptography "works" in any kind of strong sense; by comparison with a related problem that people understand is surprisingly hard to answer. We suspect it does, but it doesn\'t and no one is likely to prove any time soon that it does.

': 2, '> Having achieved that, you can wax over most uncertainty about constant factors by adding a bit more size and resulting in a cracking problem which cannot be computed in the physical universe, as we know it.\n\nBut, as you know, even if the cost of computing a function is proved to be superpolynomial in "almost all" cases, it does not mean that it is secure in practice.  The costs 15 n^log ^log ^log ^log ^n and 2^n-1024 are superpolynomial, whereas n^500 and 2^1024 n are polynomial; now plug n = 1024 in that...  The reason why P vs NP is such a baffling problem is that the P and non-P classes are indistinguishable if the functions are restricted to any finite domain, even if it is "practically infinite" like n < 10^500.\n\nMoreover, public-key cryptography depends on the existence of trapdoor functions of some sort.  It has been decades since I looked, but AFAIK the existence of such functions has not been proved, either in the asymptotic or in the practical sense.  Is this true?  If so, perhaps we will find out one day that every function that can be computed in time t(n) can be inverted in time at most t(n) log n, or something like that...': 1}, ('Ecuador is Trying to Quit Dollarization by Introducing a Government Backed Cryptocurrency', 0): {}, ('Do Not Use OKCoin: Too Many Red Flags, Withdraw Your Funds ASAP', 199): {"Yeah, and as I came to find out there definitely was things being hidden from me/us. \n\nYeah, the OKC situation is unfortunate, that's for sure.
