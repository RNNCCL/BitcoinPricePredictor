No, that is not my contention at all. Nor was it the point of the discussion. \n\nYou need a license, to show that you are complaint with state regulations and laws that prevent murder and pedophilia.

They are as regulated as it is reasonably possible based on existing interpretation of laws.\n\nNY and CA have been considering additional licenses for bitcoin businesses, that could be more stringent, or different, from the MSB regulation.  But they haven\'t enacted them yet.  In that process, they could also decide that only those bitcoin regs apply, and thus the MSB regs are irrelevant for a bitcoin / USD exchange.  Therefore a bitcoin company saying they were regulated as a MSB would be irrelevant.\n\nThus, from their perspective, Coinbase is not regulated as a bitcoin exchange, since those regulations don\'t exist.  And they are hedging on whether they think a MSB license is enough.\n\n\n  \n\n': 1, 'One man\'s "money laundering" is another\'s "free trade."

': 1, 'I was at this presentation in San Antonio and the title is very misleading. The questioner was asking about their plans for the currency in-game and Bitcoin was brought up almost as an aside or joke, albeit in a fairly positive way. \n\nIt is still relevant and significant, because the creator, Chris Roberts (the creator of the Wing Commander series) has made the most successful kickstarter ever, with over 70 million pledged by the backers. There are no big time publishers of this game.. it is a purely crowdfunded masterpiece whose demand is derived from what the player base themselves want to see.\n\nAfter the conference I got to thinking, with all of the uncertainty surrounding in game currencies and particularly with the advent of a huge market for trading virtual "in-game" currencies for real life money, would it not make sense to finally put one of these games\' currency systems on a blockchain? \n\nLet\'s assume that CIG (the game producer of Star Citizen) decided to create its own crypto currency (lets call it the UEE credit for example, and yes, I have made a changetip moniker by this name and use it to tip in the Star Citizen reddit sub), they could mathematically prove where all of the transactions are going, and preempt fraud and hacking/dupes with this kind of money. \n\nThis kind of system would allow for a more robust in game economy; one that is based on verifiable currency, rather than relying on the developer to inject random and possibly massive amounts of virtual currency at a whim. You would allow for mathematically provable scarcity, which would, along with overwhelming demand for ships and items sold by the game itself, generate value as a medium of exchange to the participants. It would also make it easy to securely transfer credits offline, through Bitcoin-like wallets on your phone. \n\nFurther, this kind of currency, because it is blockchain based, would allow for NPCs (non player characters, or computer controlled characters for the uninitiated), to possess verifiable amounts of currency themselves. This would allow for interesting scenarios where NPCs could have their own virtual wallets which grow or diminish based on their behavior, and you could see bounties generated for them if they adopted piracy and so on. Ships could trade currency with one another, and exchange value based on pre determined conditions. There are so many incredible possibilities. \n\nOne thing that amused me about Star Citizen was seeing a lot of the concept art include "banks" in the far future in them. With a Bitcoin like currency, money would simply be a content type, like an MP3 or text message. This is one of the most fundamental things that, to me, was a revelation in discovering Bitcoin.

Without a cartel in place this might even be unavoidable in my view. \n\nMy analysis is that if the blocksize is increased the bitcoin network becomes much more vulnerable. The low blocksize is a sort of fail-safe that guarantees that the fees remain at a resonable level. \n\nLet's assume the we implement the proposed blocksize increase. The miners are heavily invested in mining hardware and will protect their profits. Their ability to act in the best interest of the network is limited because they have invested (often with borrowed money) into mining hardware. If their profit margins are threatened, they will eventually be forced to turn off their mining rigs. Before that though, they will start include every transaction with a fee regardless if it is below any self-imposed threshold, because they want to stay in business as long as possible. This in turn will make the transaction fees plumet, resulting in even less profits for the miners. In this scenario the difficulty will fall rapidly, making the network vulnerable to a 51% attack. This is the endgame scenario I described in my original post. \n\nThe nightmare scenario above is not possible with scarce block size. Because then the miners will have a guaranteed income (transaction fees), determined by a demand vs supply of block space. \n\n>It will only approach zero if users don't see value in paying fees.\n\nAre you saying that Bitcoin users are willing to pay a premium fee to protect the network?

This allows them to price the confirmation times according to the urgency needed.

If miners can't figure out a way to make charge for these services and stay in business, then bitcoin fails.  It has nothing to do with artificial scarcity of block size.  \n\nThey must charge for their services.

The point I\'m stuck at is how this fixes anything. Transaction N is still vulnerable to double spending, so norisk either has to trust the customer and accept a 0 confirmation transaction into the multisig wallet as valid, or has to wait for the appropriate number of confirmations to prevent a double spend. Likewise, the merchant has to trust the norisk service and give service based on a 0 confirmation transaction m, or wait for the appropriate number of confirmations to prevent a double spend. It seems like not only would this mean there is still a wait for confirmations, but this service doubles the wait time because norisk service can\'t put up the collateral needed for the "0 confirmation" acceptance of payment by the merchant until m1 is certain to have funds, and the merchant isn\'t going to trust that the collateral has been put up by norisk with no confirmations if they\'re smart.\n\nplus, couldn\'t a malicious seller drain norisk\'s funds by refusing to sign any transactions moving funds out of wallet m2?

Each Bitcoin is divisible to the 8th place, ie 100 Million Satoshi makes one Bitcoin. If a single coin becomes to scarce/expensive everyone could use millibits or bits instead. ": 3, '> It does not!\n\nIt does actually, you\'re simply not looking at it from the right perspective.\n\nIf you want more money circulating in the economy to satisfy growth you can do one of two things (or both). This example works better with gold than fiat so lets use that as an example when we compare it to Bitcoin.\n\nYou can either:\n\n 1 Add more gold to the economy. Mining gold, like Bitcoin\'s block reward, adds more units to the economy and as long as there is steady demand to meet that increase in gold/bitcoin, the prices remain stable. This means you need to trust someone to add/remove the right amount of money at the right time though.\n\nOR\n\n 2 Increase the value of the money supply by increasing the value of each already existing unit. For gold this gets tricky though as even though less gold will buy you more, it can only be divided so far until it becomes unmanageable. If an ounce was the unit of account it could only be easily divided down to 1 gram (1/1000th) before it becomes prohibitively difficult to divide further. With Bitcoin, if the value of each unit goes up, the divisibility is not a problem at all and it can be happily segmented to a 100,000,000th (one hundred million\'th) of a unit so adding extra bitcoin units into circulation is not a problem at all via this method (or I should more accurately say activating dormant bitcoin decimal places for the pedantic). All you\'re really doing is activating dormant decimal places that were already there but were never used as they held little to no value when the value of each bitcoin was low. Divisibility can easily increase the number of usable units in circulation so the extremely small units (unused decimal places that have no useful value now) that lie dormant can be used as Bitcoin\'s value increases. Essentially the Bitcoin network already has a massive supply from it\'s inception, it contains all the units it will ever need for it\'s lifetime, it is just that it lies in this dormant state, either through the unutilised decimals, or via block rewards that are not yet in circulation, it is up to the market to infuse those decimals with value so that it can cater to the growth of the Bitcoin economy.\n\nThis increase in value encourages people to sell/spend as they can do more with less with the increase and this will eventually get recirculated to those that don\'t have any Bitcoins but want to acquire some. For this reason among others this is why Bitcoin is a better form of money than gold as it\'s divisibility is far more flexible than gold\'s is.\n\nAs adding more bitcoin units to the economy is fraught with difficulties because the network is designed to be completely autonomous and decentralised, adding more Bitcoin to the network via the block reward is nigh on impossible, so Bitcoin\'s only option then is to increase the number of units in circulation via increasing the value of each bitcoin, so that the extra decimal places gain sufficient value that they can be used for commerce. This approach also ensures that people are encouraged to continue using/saving/promoting Bitcoin usage as they will be the main benefactors of Bitcoin\'s growth into the future and this also helps prevent further coin loss by giving the increase in value to those that already know how to hold/secure their coins.\n\nThis is how you increase the money supply without ever needing to directly increase the money supply, it does away with needing a bunch of know-it-all suits saying "this is the best direction for the economy moving forward" and then inadvertently destroying the market with their politically driven manipulation.\n\n': 2, 'Right.  So it makes perfect sense.  I was equating money = value (as it does).  So the same value (money) will be represented by less of the currency (bitcoin).  So instead of more whole units of currency (bitcoin) being created to become generated in coinbase transactions, which will then need to be circulated from the top down, whole bitcoins will be subdivided futher if needed and simultaneously enrich all current bitcoin holders instead of just those generating the currency (like the FED does now.)': 2, 'Do the math.\n\nIncreasing divisibility does not alter what percentage of units existing holders have.\n\nIncreasing money supply does.\n\nThey are NOT the same.': 1}, ('Terrible experience with lieferservice.de (via Bitpay)', 7): {'well, i CANT share that view. i ordered 30x times via that service with ZERO problems.\n': 0, "ordered many times with lieferservice.de and bitcoin and never had any problem.

PPCoin\xe2\x80\x99s proof of stake algorithm works as follows. When creating a proof-of-stake block, a miner needs to construct a \xe2\x80\x9ccoinstake\xe2\x80\x9d transaction, sending some money in their possession to themselves as well as a preset reward (like an interest rate, similar to Bitcoin\xe2\x80\x99s 25 BTC block reward). A SHA256 hash is calculated based only on the transaction input, some additional fixed data, and the current time (as an integer representing the number of seconds since Jan 1, 1970). This hash is then checked against a proof of work requirement, much like Bitcoin, except the difficulty is inversely proportional to the \xe2\x80\x9ccoin age\xe2\x80\x9d of the transaction input. Coin age is defined as the size of the transaction input, in PPcoins, multiplied by the time that the input has existed. Because the hash is based only on the time and static data, there is no way to make hashes quickly by doing more work; every second, each PPCoin transaction output has a certain chance of producing a valid work proportional to its age and how many PPCoins it contains, and that is that. Essentially, every PPCoin can act as a \xe2\x80\x9csimulated mining rig\xe2\x80\x9d, albeit with the interesting property that its mining power goes up linearly over time but resets to zero every time it finds a valid block.': 1, 'unicorns and rainbows': 1, "I'm sorry, but what guarantees 1 BITUSD = 1 USD?": 3, 'I think the white paper explains it best: http://whatisbitusd.com/whitepaper/\n\nThe TL;DR version is that the smart contract backing it holds 300% of the value in locked collateral.\n\nWhen/if two-way pegging to PoS chains becomes reality then bitshares will likely become a bitcoin sidechain and bitBTC wont even be needed, you can just trade bitUSD against real bitcoin\n\n\n': -1, "Real answer: I might be mistaken, but I think there's an internal alt coin that backs bitusd.

You also seem to have misunderstood what nullc and sipa might have to "gain" by keeping the size as is. Sidechains use the same commodity as bitcoin and thus there is no financial gain seeing as no one is selling anything. \n\nI would like to agree with Gavin mainly because it would be nice to scale the blockchain (convenience "argument"). I also find merit to his points in his blog about this very issue. On the other hand I also respect the opinions of nullc and sipa and thus I will reserve my ultimate opinion on the matter until more clear arguments are presented and more actual testing has been done. The very core of the issue is that in order to decentralize the blockchain a lot of people will have to be able to run a full node - this can only be accomplished if the full node can run on standard equipment. It will make sense to raise the limit on the block size to a equilibrium between block size and "enough nodes". What the block size for this equilibrium is is to be discussed and will even change when equipment changes.\n\nI hope we in the future will see main-chain off-loading onto off-chains so the main-chain won\'t have to bother with unimportant transactions. But for now I am happy with the work of Gavin and I am constantly reminded of why he was the best candidate to take over the project for Satoshi - Gavin will do what seems to be best for bitcoin now and in the immediate future - he is not held up by "perfect solutions" and neither does he propose implementations that are not completely thought through.': 10, 'If bitcoin is hard forked, the miners will be the ones deciding which fork they will follow.
