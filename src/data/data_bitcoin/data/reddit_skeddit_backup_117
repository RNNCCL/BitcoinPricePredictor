Values flow out of many various things in various proportions: speculation, store of value, medium of exchange, hobby interest, etc.\n\n> Is Bitcoin a settlement layer?\n\nBitcoin can be used as a settlement layer, it's not its only use case but it's a very narrow use case that should be one of the more reliable ones because of its narrow requirements set.\n\n> Can a cartel of miners force a change to the protocol (like increasing the 21M cap) ?\n\nYes, for some users. There are many users of Bitcoin who only use what are called SPV clients, these clients do not check rules like the 21M cap and they can be forced into increasing the 21M cap. However SPV users can also switch their software to a different client that is not vulnerable to this issue.\n\n> Can all improvements be made via soft fork?\n\nTheoretically anything could happen via a soft fork, although not purely through a soft fork, users would also have to be complicit in a change. So a hard fork will never be necessary, however at some point it might be the best option on the table.\n\n> When will fees be absolutely needed to secure the Blockchain ?\n\nAfter 2024 we should hope to see fees starting to carry some of the reward burden, but it will take 100 years for the rewards to disappear completely and the miners depend absolutely on fees.\n\n> Can fees pay for Bitcoin security without a block size limit in the protocol ?\n\nThere is no clear answer to how exactly fees can pay for Bitcoin security. In general it's thought that we can use the fee mechanism to provide for security but the details of how we do that are not clear.\n\n> What is Bitcoin road map, in your view ?\n\nThe goal of Bitcoin is to provide a money networking layer. I don't see any specific road there, because there is no central coordinating force guiding us along a path. We just have to fix problems as they come along and hope that people who work with Bitcoins can make money for themselves and improve Bitcoin for end users at the same time.\n": 4, ">As for the roadmap, they've already posted that on the bitcoin core website.\n\nLink ?": 1, 'These are good questions.  I am not a core developer, but I will attempt to answer them nonetheless:\n\n> * What give bitcoins their value (speculation, store of value, medium of exchange, other) ?\n\nThe value given to Bitcoins, the first mover in the new cryptocurrency world, derives from perception and the market, i.e. the amount that people are willing to buy and sell them at.  The market is comprised of individual selfish actors, each of whom may have wildly different modes of value determination, and unknowable alliances and collusions.  The reasons mentioned in the question are significant for some segments of the market.  Also fear, hype, greed, and many other subjectives.  But as a market, buyer and seller need not agree on (nor even discuss) value determination.  So you would have to poll them individually.  This is the literal answer.\n\nOn the other hand, *I* believe Bitcoins are valuable because they represent an innovation grander than any that have graced humanity for millennia.  We\'ve cured diseases, split the atom, gone to space, and directly harnessed the power of the giant fusion reactor in the sky.  The Internet (and radio and telegraph before that) connected the world, and smartphones put it in our pockets, in our ears, and on our wrists.  \n\nBut not since the origin of spoken and written language have we faced such a major evolutionary stepping stone as now.  Distributed ownership and consensus via blockchain and proof of work (the core innovation here) changes the game.  Within 50 years, our society will be transformed by this.  When the Internet was new, it was hard to understand the implications it would have.  People laughed, but look at what it did to the music industry, book stores, financial services, and more within a decade.  This is bigger.  It\'s hard to imagine now, but our entire evolving notion of time and reality are likely to adapt around these new concepts.\n\n\n\n> Is Bitcoin a settlement layer ?\n\nBitcoin can be a settlement layer.  But more importantly it\'s a foundation.  Like TCP/IP, all of our higher layer applications relating to distributed ownership and consensus will be built on this.  When TCP/IP was invented, nobody had World of Warcraft or Facebook in mind.  But they were built on top of this protocol (and other layers).\n\n\n\n\n> Can a cartel of miners force a change to the protocol (like increasing the 21M cap) ?\n\nYes.  This would create alternate chains (fork), and participants (miners, merchants, users, ...) in the network might choose to follow only one or even both of the forks.  At this point the protocol changed, but the original one still exists.  Parallel timelines.\n\n\n\n\n\n> Can all improvements be made via soft fork or will a hard fork be necessary one day ?\n\nDrastic changes require hard forks.  Hard forks are dangerous.  Bitcoin can evolve without hard forks.  But it might be necessary at some point to hard fork (e.g. major SHA-256 vulnerability found).\n\n\n> When will fees be absolutely needed to secure the Blockchain ?\n\n> Can fees pay for Bitcoin security without a block size limit in the protocol ?\n\nI actually didn\'t fully understand what these questions are getting at.  I\'m assuming "fees" refers to transaction fees here, and that this concerns incentives for miners as the block reward shrinks over time... I suggest rephrasing and clarifying these questions a bit.\n\nOn the topic of fees, however, I will say that the current typical fee of 0.1 mBTC (~USD $0.05) is orders of magnitude below the true value of what Bitcoin already provides in a transaction.  And, related, I also see no problem with a fee market evolving.  Markets (as opposed to centralization and democracy) are the essence of decentralized game-theoretical systems like Bitcoin!  Anybody who doesn\'t grasp this is missing the big picture.\n\nIt\'s true that higher fees will make fewer people send trivial amounts of Bitcoin directly on the blockchain.  This is not a problem.  They will have other ways of transacting, e.g. side chains.  The Bitcoin core developers have a detailed roadmap for increasing throughput, scalability, and resiliency.\n\nThere is some concern that blocks are quickly going to become constantly full, the transaction mempool will grow and grow with unprocessed transactions, and Bitcoin will fail under its own weight.  Absurd.  Worst case, press around increased fees leads to even more demand for Bitcoin (e.g. "they must be pretty valuable if people are paying $100s just to move them around!").  This is just the beginning.\n\n\n\n\n\n> What is Bitcoin road map, in your view ?\n\nI leave this to the core developers to answer in detail.  But the roadmap should focus on maintaining resiliency, fungibility, decentralization, and security.  It should grow the capacity and capabilities of the network methodically.  We are still at the beginning, and decisions we make now will have lasting impact.  We\'re building the scaffolding for the future of reality.\n\n\n\n\n': 1, "> What give bitcoins their value (speculation, store of value, medium of exchange, other) ?\n\nThat's something you should research for yourself, there's no authoritative answer that would suffice, only personal opinions.\n\nAs for the roadmap, they've already posted that on the bitcoin core website.": 0}, ('Recreating Google\xe2\x80\x99s PageRank on The Bitcoin Blockchain', 8): {}, ('I observed the number of repositories on Guthub mentioning Bitcoin and after the huge increase (link), the growth rate is slowing, should we worry?', 0): {}, ('Bitcoin Group IPO Offer closes today at 5pm, 25 Jan 2016', 1): {"The Bitcoin Group team have invested years of their lives in Bitcoin and persisted with trying to become the worlds first bitcoin mining IPO on a major stock exchange.

The next in sequence would logically be a Tick with a 10 nanometer process, but Intel is now putting "refresh cycles" after the tocks. The next processor, announced for 2016, will be a refresh of the Skylake, still with a 14 nanometer process.

Like today we have limbo transactions from people who used tiny fees, the solution for them is either stop doing those tiny fee transaction or to submit using a reasonable transaction fee. By the way this would happen even if there is a natural limit to the block size, like if over a certain size the orphan risk gets too high.\n3. When does it stop being a current bottleneck though?

The cost will be driven down to the marginal cost of production. This is small(er) but non-zero. Miners will restrict block size by including as many transactions as is profitable. I.e. block size will be limited by the miners, as profit maximisers, without a production quota set by the devs.\nMiners will act to maximise *the sum* of fees, which is not the same as raising the *minimum* fee.

No because that is how mining was designed to work: rewards are supposed to drop!\n5. "The economic majority favors rash action."

Why not have Reddit users vote on whether to make the screen bigger?\n\nWhy doesn\'t Twitter do the same?  Why not have Reddit users determine whether or not to increase the character limit above 140?\n\nThe answer--quite unintuitive--is that voting is a terrible way to decide *most* things.  That\'s right, **voting is awful for most decisions**.\n\nWhy?  That\'s even more unintuitive: it\'s because voting is costless.  Let\'s unpackage that a bit:\n\nWhen I buy a car, I pay $30K.  If I buy a great car for me, I capture all the benefit of that decision.  I get to drive it.  I get to feel good in it.  Nobody else does unless I let them.  If I buy a crappy car, I capture all the downside of that decision.  I\'m the one stuck with it, making the repairs, suffering its shortcomings.  Nobody else does.\n\nWhen I vote, I pay very little.  Let\'s say I\'m in a big family of 10 brothers, all of whom will be driving the car we buy, and which car we buy will be determined by a vote.  We will contributing $3K each.  I have way less incentive to research the various car brands/models, try to find the cheapest deal, read consumer reports, test drive each one, etc.  Same with each of my brothers.\n\nIf I vote well, I\'m not the only one who benefits--all my brothers do.  In other words, I capture 1/10th the benefit of a good decision.  If I vote to buy a crappy car, I\'m not the only one who suffers--all my brothers do.  In other words, I capture 1/10th the downside of a bad decision.\n\nIn this scenario, voting will yield way worse of a decision.  There\'s little upside for me in making a good purchase and little downside for me in making a bad decision.  \n\nThat\'s why voting is a terrible way to make most decisions.  And why markets are better.

There is a collection of proposals, some stemming from a p2pool-inspired informal sketch of mine and some independently invented, called "weak blocks", "**thin&nbsp;blocks**" or "soft blocks".  These proposals build on top of efficient relay techniques (like the relay network protocol or IBLT) and move virtually all the transmission time of a block to before the block is found, eliminating size from the orphan race calculation. We already desperately need this at the current block sizes. These have not yet been implemented, but fortunately the path appears clear. I\'ve seen at least one more or less complete specification, and I expect to see things running using this in a few months. This tool will remove propagation latency from being a problem in the absence of strategic behavior by miners.  Better understanding **their behavior when miners behave strategically is an open question.**\n\n* This sort of thing is mentioned further in the [capacity scaling FAQ](https://bitcoincore.org/en/2015/12/23/capacity-increases-faq/#weak-blocks-iblts):\n\n    > *Weak blocks and IBLTs just say \xe2\x80\x9c2016\xe2\x80\x9d in the roadmap schedule.

The last thing you need is for you to drain $1,000 monthly for the price to crash down once again. Like you said, you want to keep it small. I'd say around $5-$20 monthly would do the trick. Just keep in mind to stick to that agenda. \n\n* I'd suggest bimonthly, at the most, you transfer half your wallet's balance into a hard storage, such as Bitcoin Core, or a virtual vault found in sophisticated wallets like Coinbase. This way, you can still have a considerable amount of money to use in your wallet, all ready to go, but have most of your money locked up and protected(ish). \n\n* If you can, one of the best ways you can invest into Bitcoins is by becoming a miner.

If the demand grows quicker than throughput then the fees will rise and the Lightning Network will get traction. Nobody opposes the Lightning Network, but the block chain capacity should not be arbitrarily constrained.\n\n2) It is better to have a fee event after Bitcoin becomes the mainstream and the block reward becomes negligible.\n\nIf the fee event happened in 2009, Bitcoin would never get traction. The block reward is here to subsidise the transaction fees. Higher the fees -> slower the adoption -> higher the risks of holding bitcoins.\n\nAmount of work needed to secure the network doesn't depend on amount of transactions in block. More transactions in block - lower the fees per transaction for the same level of security.\n\nNegligible fees won't kill Bitcoin, but slow adoption due to the artificially constrained capacity may give an advantage to altcoins.\n\nSo it is better to have a fee event as late as possible.": 4, 'We will inevitably have a "fee event" (thanks Garzik for the scare phrase soundbite) at some stage in the Bitcoin\'s network future, unless it fails miserably and becomes entirely unpopular.

After we demonstrate/debug/test the network functioning in fee-paying mode and much of the ancillary surrounding wallets and upper layers have been prepared to handle such events then we are in good shape for the future. If it is by then demonstrated that raising the max_block_size is safely within the current technological limits of the day then we may not have another "fee event" for years but will be better prepared in the case such a future outcome arises, predictably or unexpectedly. It will be another belt to the braces of the max_block_size bitcoin already possess. A functioning fee market infrastructure held in reserve is another level of robustness for the medium term and something that is inevitably necessary to develop/implement for the long term transition to fee driven security model anyway.\n\nWe should not put this off, bite the bullet and do this now, design for success.': 5}, ('Probably the first Youtube video on bitcoin', 0): {}, ('BitFury vs BTCChina Pool, neck and neck', 3): {}, ('Weekly Bitcoin Show - Any Interest?', 7): {'would love to watch this :) goodluck ': 1, "Yes, what we mean is that because bitcoin is a worldwide currency, that means people don't need bank accounts or PayPal to use Bitcoin and therefore watch your videos.
