Humans forget passwords all the time, which is especially relevant when that password may not be used for years until the backup is finally needed. Furthermore, it is very important to us to encourage users to create backups in a way that their heirs will be able to recover their wallets in the event of disappearance or death. Any backups that require the original user\'s memory will result in permanently lost coins.\n\nMany users want BIP38 encrypted backups because they want to limit single-points of failure -- i.e the backup being found by an unauthorized person. BIP38 enable a kind of 2-of-2 backup: in order to restore your wallet, you need a piece of paper and a piece of information in your brain. Armory achieves the same goal but without user\'s memory, by providing fragmented backups. You can make a 2-of-2 backup which is a safer version of BIP38 encrypted backups. In fact, a 2-of-3 or 3-of-5 is even better, as it adds redundancy in addition to security.\n\nWe understand this doesn\'t necessarily meet 100% of use cases, but we also find it our duty to help guide users to best practices that ensure both security and "continuity," especially since many of these aspects of using and securing bitcoins are non-intuitive.': 2, "It's not as simple as you make it sound.

We do not trust wallet timestamps because it is unverfied meta data. If we had a reliable way to verify it, we wouldn't just use it to skip scans on fresh addresses.

It\'s speculative on my part, but hear me out and see what you think. In late 2014, when a bitcoin was still worth way in excess of $300, I estimated that $225 was the minimum price for mining to be economically viable. Since then, the price has fallen and has remained in this range since mid-January 2015.\n\nIn the meantime, the amount of early-stage investment going into Bitcoin has more than tripled--$344 million YTD compared to $103 million for the same period in 2014 (source: CoinDesk).\n\nIn late 2014, a prominent Bitcoin miner who had earlier in the year raised $20 million announced that they had raised an additional $20 million to fund operations and projects. I didn\'t understand the announcement at the time, but it stuck in the back of mind. In January 2015, a big retail cloud mining operation (who I suspect is closely aligned with the prominent miner, above) announced they would "pause" mining operations. The price was around $300 at this time.\n\nIn hindsight, I wonder how these people knew the price would not recover. And all the seed and VC money coming in--where were all these funds being deployed?\n\nSo, it comes back to $225. At this price, all miners commissioned prior to late-2014 are loss making (except those that get free electricity). That\'s more than 250 PHash of processing power made obsolete and replaced with new-generation miners. At today\'s hash rate of 325 PHash, I estimate around 300 PHash is new hardware deployed since late 2014. At $600/THash, this is worth around $180 million.\n\nIf I take this question further, what kind of investor goes into mining to break even. That is, sell all the mined bitcoins to recover operating costs, leaving zero profit? Aren\'t these guys supposed to the the "smart money?"\n\nNow, think back to the prominent miner (and many like him). In today\'s context, when they raised additional capital to "fund operations," they knew the price would come down. That money is allowing them to pay the bills while retaining bitcoins.\n\nDue to shallow trading volumes, big investors have decided that mining is the best way to acquire large amounts of coin. And in order to bag the biggest share of the mining reward, by eliminating most of the older (amatuer) miners, they use their funds to manage bitcoin supply and depress prices.\n\nWhat this means is that some very important and rich groups are vying to acquire as many coins as possible. Could this be an indication to some sort of future for Bitcoin? Does it mean those holding bitcoin will also benefit from these long-term trends?\n\nThere are two risks to this strategy:\n\n1) Bitcoin flops and disappears from the face of the Earth. Having the smart money onside has its benefits.\n\n2) Bitcoin takes off too early. Organic demand grows, pushing the price up. Those holding coins now will benefit most.

And once you do understand what they mean, what Bitcoin means, Attraction Amplified. So after lurking for a while and learning the basics, I came to this simple conclusion. I wanted it. But I honestly couldn't justify out right buying it.\n> \n> So I set myself a goal. I\xe2\x80\x99ll try earning just .1 bitcoin. Looking back, this took me way too long because I sticked with the faucets and paytoclick sites for way too long. But once I got go my first .1 BTC in February of 2015 I set myself a new goal.

I discovered the wonderful world of multi-sig addresses, and the benefits they offer for security. I\xe2\x80\x99ve also learned how to store the backups for these in exotic offline devices like calculators and digital cameras. I\xe2\x80\x99ve even attended a Bitcoin ATM release event, Cool stuff.\n> \n> **Conclusion:** Bitcoin is simply amazing and amazingly simple in its simplicity. Overall it\xe2\x80\x99s been a fun experiment, and I\xe2\x80\x99m glad I did it, but this is definitely not a method for everyone. Buying from an exchange or ATM is much faster to acquire BTC.

Whoever made the page should regenerate the charts with the "volume in currency" button checked for a more accurate analysis.\n\nIt is also worth noting the absolute sheer volume difference between USD and all the rest of the currencies.

Because they can\'t "vote with their node", as they\'re being asked to do today with BitcoinXT, the opinions of the true economic majority wouldn\'t matter.': -7, "He wasn't making an argument, therefore it's not an ad hom. He was just giving you advice.": 1, 'X-posting this from [other thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3ajkbp/finally_discussions_of_whether_bitcoin_should_or/csdirr1):\n\nOP\'s entire premise is based on a strawman argument. That the limit ought to be raised doesn\'t mean it\'s safe to lock Bitcoin into 8GB blocks in 2037. That many years ahead in the future, SO MANY things will have changed, with Bitcoin and with the world, and no one can predict those changes. They can at best make you "feel good" about them, and assuage with very high figures, here\'s what\'s 99% good to happen, here\'s what\'s 50% good to happen.\n\nIn this case though, the decision being made potentially results in cataclysmic failure of Bitcoin to remain free of state control, which is to say the entire point of Bitcoin\'s decentralization is being put at jeopardy. How soon could cracks in Moore\'s Law or Nielsen\'s Law lead to dramatically less true P2P participation in the network? No one can know for sure, and that\'s where you lose everyone in the XT camp. They think true P2P participation is doomed, usually because they can\'t imagine Bitcoin QT being user-friendly. There\'s no reason why it can\'t be made to function similarly to AntiVirus software. Imagine: if average internet connection speeds really *are* 140 MB/s in the year 2037, fantastic. At those rates, you could sync the entire Bitcoin blockchain in 6 minutes flat. And before then? You could use SPV mode. After? You could decide pruning is for you, and now the cost incurred on your home desktop is truly minimal.\n\nBut that is all speculation on my part. Predicting great technological boons in the future is easy, what\'s hard to get 100% right 100% of the time, is the timing of any of these events. It\'s like predicting the price of Bitcoin. No one has any clue what the price will be in 7 days, but we can get together some tea leaves, and feel pretty good rubbing our hands together over the Magic 8 Ball. TA doesn\'t even make sense in financial markets. Past trends are not predictive of the future. Why does it make sense to do that with Bitcoin, **when the very reason for the block size limit is to vaccinate Bitcoin against the type of attack that makes running full nodes impossible to do on home computers**.\n\n> And there rests the burden of proof\n\nNo. Block size limit isn\'t about active attacks, it\'s about managing risk for when attacks do happen, which can\'t be predicted, and certainly not when we\'re predicting 20 years out from today.\n\nThat your home computer can\'t keep up with 8GB blocks hitting it every 10 minutes using today\'s hardware is common knowledge. What Gavin\'s proposal does is it sets a ticking time bomb. Now, before the year 2036 Moore\'s Law or Nielsen\'s Law may show some cracks. Nothing is set in stone, we just have past data trends, but trends are not predictive. Yet demand for an international currency of fixed supply could have surged by 2036, in which case we will be left with a network outright *impossible* for any medium sized business, let alone an *individual*, to handle on a home computer.\n\nWhat does that do to Bitcoin as an evolution of currency?\n\nIf only ISPs can run Bitcoin because it was "attacked" by foes or by natural user demand after unvaccinating itself against just such an attack, is that the bedrock of the true evolution of currency? I contend that NO, it is very much something different from the evolution of currency. It\'s something that started nice, but didn\'t quite get all the way there. Maybe it wins a silver metal, but a *more* trustless currency has more intrinsic value. I am willing to say such a currency engineered by /u/nullc would be superior to any currency sufficiently large as to be *inaccessible* by the common man on a home computer.\n\nOutsourcing to some intermediary is great when it saves resources, but it isn\'t worth basing your currency on that. In the worst case scenario, this intermediary is SkyNet. All manner of attacks become possible if, failures for Moore\'s Law to hold or cracks in Nielsen\'s Law rear their ugly hands. There are no guarantees in life.': -2, "It's 8MB. Where has 8GB come from? You will not be downloading 8MB every 10 minutes. 8MB is the maximum size.

If the vouchers are easily tradable then unwilling recipients can sell them on the open market, and people who wanted to shop there anyway can now buy the store credit at a discount, even if just a small one. Effectively the wealthier gift-givers are subsidising poorer but thrifty shoppers.\n\nAnyway if this logic holds together it means there may still justifiable value in issuing gift vouchers if you can incentivise (I have no idea how, or if this format makes it easier) existing customers to buy sufficiently more of them.\n\nIt may be cheaper to administer the scheme this way, although I'm struggling to imagine that overall it would offset the income from unspent cards.": 2, 'I absolute love this idea, however the way Gyft has implemented it, it\'s less likely to take off.\n\nThe most important thing is that the transferability of these tokens is severely limited.

No amount of money stands even a slight chance against this. Inflation is a big deal in conjuction with the tax system, as it is strategically produced and given to particular entities that are functional/essential to the system as a whole. Someone who owns 2/3 of all the bitcoin would be like an extremely limited reserve with no power to gain value back. The money would be best spent on creating mechanisms which gain ownership of the means of production, as the means of money isn't accessible to people via bitcoin.

The basic point is that the computer makes electric noise of many kinds, and this noises changes based on what the computer is doing, and from that an attacker who can observe the noise can decode the operations and learn about the secrets that it handling.\n\nMore precisely;  Modular exponentiation (for RSA, or point-scalar multiply for EC) uses some analog of  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Egyptian_multiplication (sometimes just that exactly or some fancier version the basic understanding is the same) as the basic secret operation.  \n\nThere are two operations, double and add (or square and multiply by the base in the exponential case), and the pattern they're performed in just depends on the secret key being used.  So the processor will cycle between doubling and adding and each take a relatively long amount of time, and each will have its own electrical signature because the pattern of operations inside it is quite different, just like a printer may sound different feeding from the letter tray than from the envelope slot.\n\nCalibration for individual machines should not be required-- if there are two distinct patterns at all, you classify into two groups and then one is used for zeros in the number and one for ones. If you got it backwards, just reverse the two.  You would probably want some knowledge of the software in use as there are multiple ways to order the algorithm, though manually inspecting the trace can usually tell you a lot about the algorithm.\n\nKeep in mind that once you think you have a decode you can simply test against the victim's public key to see if you're right. This also means that you don't have to successfully read every bit: if some were ambiguous you can try nearby variations until you get it.\n\nCareful software design can greatly reduce the emissions by making it so that the operations the computer performs are almost exactly the same regardless of the secret key, e.g. by performing both the 0 and 1 operation for each bit and then conditionally swapping or copying the correct value. Alternatively the values can be pre/post scrambled using additional secrets with cheap blinding operations that themselves have little to no noise signature.\n\nUnfortunately, it's difficult to be secure against a sufficiently well equipped  attacker (e.g. one that can connect high resolution probes directly to the power) and it's also very difficult to tell how much a particular implementation is leaking on particular hardware without carefully examining it with expensive test equipment... at least once you've gotten past the most gross implementation stupidity.

Thus the motive of eliminating the total BTC in circulation by killing me is moot.": 1, ">Once there is an ASIC\n\nI could see that.. but than you are talking about building up a system where each person needs to own this dedicated chip in order to use it.

If the difficulty is high enough it should give the first person enough chance to confirm a redeeming TX in the blockchain before someone else cracks the nonce puzzle and starts racing to break the link. However, when participants see that a person has broadcast a claiming transaction it is in the participants best interest to start working on the next IV as soon as possible: why - because in all likelihood they might not be able to double-spend (which still requires being able to -start- with a correct nonce -and- do the 5 minutes of hashing when they do.)\n\nSo the competition here is really what makes the timechain attractive to participation and unattractive to cheating, but in reality the length of the time-lock and even the currency might need to be adjusted to avoid this problem. I mean Peter Tood did recently convince F2Pool to accept replace by fee which makes this proposal potentially less rewarding - however the timechain\'s native currency isn\'t effected by these issues because its based on signing with the private key which is only available if you break a link and replace by fee won\'t work with this custom currency.\n\n3 second propagation + rejection for later signing with same key + hash-based proof of work = a blockchain simultaneously protected by the timechain -and- normal hash-based mining.\n\nAs for the -if they keep the private key part-: the answer is smart contracts. With a 3 of 4 multi-sig account where 2 of the keys belong to the owner, 1 to the recipient and 1 that is one of these "exchange" private keys - even if the exchange kept the private keys they could not use it to steal any money. So unless the exchange was also starting these contracts they would lack the leverage necessary to steal coins.\n\nIn a nutshell: there\'s no economic advantage to the exchange to potentially sabotage its future business by keeping keys around to be stolen when it can be empirically proven there is little benefit to doing so (with exceptions mentioned in the Uptrenda paper with a rogue exchange - but the general business logic still stands.)': 1, "Why wouldn't a thief have their own GPU cluster to break the timelock in the same amount of time as the business?

So in fact, I do have to trust that the other participant is an honest person (and not colluding with the escrow agent).\n\nI think you\'re still missing the point of the timechain. The idea is that a reputable agent securely builds a timechain and that after release - there is no way to disrupt the basic behaviour of the timechain even if the reputable agent were to be completely controlled by an attacker (or even disappear entirely.) So timechains only need to be generated security **once** and their basic behaviour is guaranteed for an entire *year* or longer depending on how long you make the timechain. Contrast this to an existing system: how would you do it? You would have to keep private keys around on a server and perpetually provide an active function to ensure those keys stay safe - could you guarantee it wouldn\'t be hacked for an entire year? Well the timechain can because it removes the need for third-party involvement by converting third-party trust into a deterministic data structure based on a chain of hash-based time-lock encryption keys - which is genuinely a huge improvement in security. \n\nAs for the trust problems: you\'re 100% right. This system does not offer verifiability. It\'s designed specifically to be used by reputable agents for their own services in order to keep their keys safer - however using the approaches I described in my paper can allow third-parties to use timechains and reduce the impact of trust by using multiple timechains to encrypt plaintext and threshold schemes for contracts. The trust problem still isn\'t solved but its impact is greatly reduced.\n\n> But my analogy with centralized exchanges wasn\'t about a centralized exchange getting hacked. It was about a centralized exchange acting maliciously. When exchanges get hacked, its usually not clear whether it was an inside job (ie. exchange acting maliciously) or whether they were simply incompetent. If the mechanism depends on the exchange acting competently, that implies they must be trusted to act competently/non-maliciously. So its not accurate to call it a trustless mechanism.\n\nI can\'t speak for every exchange out there but one of the reasons I\'m building the timechain is so I don\'t have to worry about having my refund system hacked. I can simply build a timechain on an offline GPU cluster, stitch the links together myself, discard the keys, and use that structure to provide a reliable refund system without having to rely on oracles to provide that functionality (whose private keys would otherwise have to sit around on servers the *entire* time.)\n\nIf an exchange wants to act incompetent and keep keys around unnecessarily that\'s up to them - but it isn\'t a counter argument for why timechains aren\'t a useful data structure or why they shouldn\'t be used - especially given that the systems that would most benefit from timechains require trust anyway.\n\n> But it does rely on humans, because there\'s no way to verify that they actually deleted the keys after time-locking them. You have to trust that they did so.\n\nYou also have to trust that the companies you do business with every day aren\'t going to run off with your money. It\'s the exact same thing: there is no reason to keep keys around with the timechain and having the possibility of services misusing it isn\'t an argument against the timechain itself. It\'s an argument against human stupidity which is ironically the main problem the timechain can avoid.\n\n\n> Thanks. It is much easier to poke holes in proposals than it is to present solutions. What\'s most difficult is to recognize valid criticism and acknowledge where one went wrong. From what I\'ve seen, people who can do that end up going much further than those who are attached to their ideas and can only respond defensively, particularly in this space (where there are so many shysters). Experts (which I am not) won\'t waste their time writing feedback to someone who will just blow them off anyway, but they will privately tell others what to ignore and what might actually have promise.\n\nAnd I appropriate it. It\'s not always fun having to receive negative feedback but its beneficial since that\'s how you learn and improve your ideas.\n\n> I think your description of a Timechain DAC sounds similar to a sequential proof-of-work blockchain, especially if it has its own native currency. And I think it could have uses, but time-locking private keys to cryptocoins is not an appropriate use case (too many flaws, masked by a rube goldberg design). The silver bullet for decentralized handling of private keys is fully homomorphic encryption. Short of that, utilizing SNARKs would be more practical (there\'s a already a library), and on more solid crypto foundations. Even the thoroughly vetted SNARKs were only recently found to have a potential vulnerability.\n\nThe last time I looked into homomorphic encryption it was literally too slow to do anything with. There\'s a lot of cool stuff in cryptography at the moment that would make the timechain obsolete if it were practical today. Things like indistinguishably obfuscation, for example, would allow you to create DACs that run themselves and do everything from use human bank accounts to hiring staff - and you could allow anyone to run such a DAC without trust ... but that\'s a long way away. I\'ll take a better look at your suggestions when I next get chance (but I\'m convinced it won\'t provide the same benefits as the timechain because I\'ve looked into this already.)\n\n> If it were easy to mash-up time-lock crypto with AES chains to get a silver bullet for secure decentralized private keys, then what\'s with all the research on FHE and SNARKs? My guess is that in order to tie up all the loose ends of time-lock chains and get a scheme that\'s actually secure, you\'d end up with something that looks much more like SNARKs or FHE. Not some clever way of stitching time-locks. Right from the start, trying to design a scheme for time-lock chains flies in the face of the cardinal rule: "Don\'t roll your own crypto." Don\'t even modify a crypto scheme, and certainly don\'t compose them like legos. Its fighting an uphill battle, pissing into the wind.\n\nYou could have said the exact same thing about the probability of having functional p2p money in 2008 (and in fact many people at the time did) - but the ingredients to build Bitcoin were available for years before it was built and cryptographers missed it entirely. So why did they miss it? Because not many people were focused on the field and not many people brought the same perspective that Satoshi did to the problem. Had an actual cryptographer tried to solve the problem - they probably would have ended up going no where because POW is considered very ugly by most cryptographers. So in answer to your question I think its perfectly possible the timechain could work and there\'s nothing novel about the crypto - it\'s quite literally just hashes, hash chains, hybrid crypto, and digital signatures.\n\nGranted, I admit the odds aren\'t in my favour for the crypto being bulletproof and I\'m certainly no cryptographer - but much of what I\'m doing is not without precedent. Hash-locked contracts have been around since 2014 for example, and there\'s no problem there. In fact one of the ways Bitcoin protects public keys and redemption scripts is with a similar hash-based approach to my own ... but obviously the overall system will still need to be vetted by people far more knowledge about cryptography than myself.\n\n\n': 2, "The solution you propose doesn't work for secure cryptocurrency exchange.

The timechain is a chain of encryption keys that can be used by anyone to encrypt information for a certain period of time - exactly how long depends on how far up the chain the keys are as each key is spaced 5 minutes apart. The timechain is also a DAC or decentralized autonomous corporation - it gives financial rewards to participants for breaking links in the chain which simultaneously releases the secrets needed to decrypt information.\n\nBy breaking links in the chain you consume 5 minutes of computing resources to be able to derive the encryption keys - which is what keeps information encrypted for a certain amount of time. When a link is broken - it also releases a puzzle to the rest of the network. The first person to solve the puzzle receives what input to use for their 5 minutes of computing resources - this is what keeps the process fair. If the first person to break a link receives the starting value for the next link then they can just keep breaking links and steal all the currency. The timechain solves that problem with mining - a very similar process to how Bitcoin does it. So our native currency with the timechain is Time (physically - since its a real cryptocurrency and ah metaphorically too.)\n\nWhy does this matter? Because as it turns out you can solve a number of important problems with the timechain. For example, if you want to do smart contracts like micropayment channels, cross-chain contracts, or anything with a refund protocol you actually can't in Bitcoin because of tx malleability - and even if you fixed that you're still screwed for alt-coins.\n\nAnd what about security? We all know exchanges and wallets suck - even with multi-sig. Keeping private keys around all the time just isn't a good idea. A much smarter idea would be to store money over time. If money wasn't all available at one point in time it would be much harder to steal.

So in fact, I do have to trust that the other participant is an honest person (and not colluding with the escrow agent).\n\n> And your analogy here with centralized exchange doesn\'t really make sense: it\'s obviously in every businesses best interest not to be hacked and lose all their customer\'s money\n\nBut my analogy with centralized exchanges wasn\'t about a centralized exchange getting hacked. It was about a centralized exchange acting maliciously. When exchanges get hacked, its usually not clear whether it was an inside job (ie. exchange acting maliciously) or whether they were simply incompetent. If the mechanism depends on the exchange acting competently, that implies they must be *trusted* to act competently/non-maliciously. So its not accurate to call it a trustless mechanism.\n\n> We\'ve suggested the timechain as one possible way to help these businesses stay secure without having to rely on humans or software (which can easily fail) \n\nBut it does rely on humans, because there\'s no way to verify that they actually deleted the keys after time-locking them. You have to trust that they did so.\n\n> Even though you do seem a bit critical you have given us valuable feedback and we made changes to our design based on what you said (to help solve the double-spend problem) - v2 of the paper coming soon.\n\nThanks. It is much easier to poke holes in proposals than it is to present solutions. What\'s most difficult is to recognize valid criticism and acknowledge where one went wrong. From what I\'ve seen, people who can do that end up going much further than those who are attached to their ideas and can only respond defensively, particularly in this space (where there are so many shysters). Experts (which I am not) won\'t waste their time writing feedback to someone who will just blow them off anyway, but they will privately tell others what to ignore and what might actually have promise.\n\nI think your description of a Timechain DAC sounds similar to a sequential proof-of-work blockchain, especially if it has its own native currency. And I think it could have uses, but time-locking private keys to cryptocoins is not an appropriate use case (too many flaws, masked by a rube goldberg design). The silver bullet for decentralized handling of private keys is fully homomorphic encryption. Short of that, utilizing SNARKs would be more practical (there\'s a already a [library](https://github.com/scipr-lab/libsnark)), and on more solid crypto foundations. Even the thoroughly vetted SNARKs were only recently found to have a potential vulnerability.\n\nIf it were easy to mash-up time-lock crypto with AES chains to get a silver bullet for secure decentralized private keys, then what\'s with all the research on FHE and SNARKs? My guess is that in order to tie up all the loose ends of time-lock chains and get a scheme that\'s actually secure, you\'d end up with something that looks much more like SNARKs or FHE. Not some clever way of stitching time-locks. Right from the start, trying to design a scheme for time-lock chains flies in the face of the [cardinal rule](http://security.stackexchange.com/questions/18197/why-shouldnt-we-roll-our-own/18198#18198): "Don\'t roll your own crypto." Don\'t even modify a crypto scheme, and certainly don\'t [compose them like legos](http://www.cryptofails.com/post/121201011592/reasoning-by-lego-the-wrong-way-to-think-about).

The whitepaper only said "a list of external time-lock providers", this timechain blogpost expands on that.\n\nThe uptrenda design is basically similar to lightning.network micropayment channels. But in order for lightning hashed time-lock channels (HTLC) to work, bitcoin tx malleability needs to be fixed, and preferably a new opcode, OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY, as well. (Note that bitcoin already has support for nLockTime, which is a tx field. nLockTime is used in the current micropayment channels, but the ways nLockTime can be used are limited because its a tx field, not a script opcode. The new script opcode would enable fancier uses of nLockTime.)\n\nTimechain gets around the requirement that tx malleability be fixed, by the use of some crazy new chain where people use GPUs to do the recursive hashing required for time-lock encryption (time-lock encryption has been around for a while, first proposed in 1993, when it was called "Timed-release crypto"). So rather than set up micropayment channels secured by the bitcoin tx field nLockTime (because again, advanced use of nLockTime channels would require fixing tx malleability and adding a new opcode), Uptrenda proposes to set up micropayment channels secured by multi-sig oracles acting as intermediaries to this crazy new Timechain thing.': 8, 'RTFA': 1, "\n>This is a good thing.
