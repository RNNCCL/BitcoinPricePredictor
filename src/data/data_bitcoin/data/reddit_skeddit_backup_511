Whonix in the other hand is entirely sandboxes. It runs two VMs, one VM runs TOR and a connects to your network and creates a local TOR proxy (the gateway). The gateway has two network adapts your NAT and a virtualized integral network. The other VM (workstation) is only connected to a virtualized internal network. This means the OS of the workstation (or any other VM configured to the same internal network) is entirely sandboxes to TOR so every app is forced to use TOR and even malware would only get the IP of TOR. Configuring proxy settings in the workstation for apps is still used for stream isolation. Whonix devs have a port prepared for Bitcoin (you must install client and configure it).

The Government LOSES money by not making arrests and seizing the property of non-violent drug dealers.  That's the only reason the DEA has salary - its to continue to repossess the money and possessions of drug dealers.  By using Bitcoin and taking Cash out of the equation, the DEA now has a much harder time tracking criminals to prosecute and seize - by Seizing silk road (illegally I might add) they have now seized a list of drug dealer aliases AND the funds they had in escrow on the SR website. I'd imagine they wanted to work with Ross and to convert SR into a honeypot - Im sure Ross was like 'fuck that' and they didn't take to well to it.
