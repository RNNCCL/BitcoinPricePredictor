There are some free notaries right now on OpenBazaar.': 2, 'Why shouldn\'t a paypal account be risk free? We pay PayPal their processing fee ostensibly for the protections they provide. Just as I use my credit card because of both the protections it provided and the rewards they give. That is the entire purpose of credit cards (compared to cash, checks or debit cards)\n\nI would vote that you a page from the collective wisdom of the Bitcoin developers and early adopters - NEVER sell an irreversible payment instrument (Bitcoin) for consideration which is reversible (ie PayPal, credit card, check). It\'s really that simple. \n\nthete are plenty of avenues to sell Bitcoin for cash, eBay just isn\'t set up to be one of those venues. \n\nExamples:\nif you buy gold from me on eBay, I can ship that hold to the address that eBay has verified as being yours, and if I ship it to that address, eBay will protect me in case a scam was being pulled - say you were out of Towm and your house sitter got ahold of your eBay and PayPal credentials. You dispute the purchase and im out both the money you that gets charged back And my gold. But since there was no way for me to know I wasbeing scammed (after all, I sold gold to a buyer with a positive feedback history And shipped it to the address that every one of that buyers previous purchases were shipped by ton. In that case eBay has my back. \n\nNext, same situation, Except your house sitter messages me on eBay asking me to ship to a different address. If I ship there, even with tracking, and you despute the charge, I\'m out of luck. Reasoning being that if a hacker could get in your account And bid, they can also send messages, but they can\'t change the mailing address for you that eBay has marked as verified. By me shipping to a messaged address rather than a verified address, I\'m taking on risk thAt eBay won\'t cover. \n\nNow for cryptos. The transaction is all electronic and until or unless eBay starts maintaining a verified Bitcoin address for each buyer, there is absolutely no way them to verify that the shipping info that was provided to me actually came from you, or if you are in control of the address that was sent to me. \n\nYou dispute the charge and me showing that the transaction occurred on the blockchain does nothing to bolster my case. It shows I sent coins to the address that was messaged to me, but not that those coins were sent to you. \n\nThis is Why eBay should be remiss about allowing the sale of crypto currencies on their site, except where usually safeguards they put in place are meant to protect the buyers, this time it would be to protect the sellers. Because whether it\'s a buyer filing a dispute with PayPal or with their crrdit card issuer, it\'s far too easy for a seller of cryptos to wind up the transaction with neither money in hand nor their bitcoins. \n\nSo what if they shoulder the risk and allow the sale of cryptos for payment via PayPal? Then every person with stolen credit card info will flock to the site and buy as many coins as they can get. Sellers transfer the coins to them and then credit card holders dispute the fraudulent charges, causing dozens or even hundreds of Bitcoin sellers complaining and dragging their name through the mud... "I sold my bitcoins on eBay, only to have the payments charged back months after the sake. eBay/PayPal totally screwed me." \n\nThe system they set up works great for physical products but it is abysmal for virtual products. That\'s the logical outcome.
