I\'ve reserved commenting in this block size debate so far, because I couldn\'t see any technical reasons for why there should be a block size limit or not.

Hashes are only calculated for the header anyway - so whether you're using a CPU, GPU, FPGA or ASIC, they all work only off of a very small amount of data that can represent just a handful of bytes or all the storage capacity in the world.  \n\nMiners do care, on the other hand, about the block size in terms of their network bandwidth.  A Chinese pool in particular has mentioned that their current internet bandwidth was not sufficient to handle 20MB, but they'd be sort of okay with 8MB.  You can do some searching around for the details of how truthful this is, including a fair bit of analysis and recently some statements with regard to bandwidth rollout in China accelerating making it a non-issue even if they couldn't just pay out of their own pocket for a more decent pipeline out of a rural hydropower location to a proper hub.": 8, "Ok, that's a good answer though.

I had hoped the debate would resolve and that a fork proposal would achieve widespread consensus.  However with the formal release of Bitcoin XT 0.11A, this looks unlikely to happen, and so I am forced to share my concerns about this very dangerous fork.\n\nThe developers of this pretender-Bitcoin claim to be following my original vision, but nothing could be further from the truth.  When I designed Bitcoin, I designed it in such a way as to make future modifications to the consensus rules difficult without near unanimous agreement.  Bitcoin was designed to be protected from the influence of charismatic leaders, even if their name is Gavin Andresen, Barack Obama, or Satoshi Nakamoto.  Nearly everyone has to agree on a change, and they have to do it without being forced or pressured into it.  By doing a fork in this way, these developers are violating the "original vision" they claim to honour.\n\nThey use my old writings to make claims about what Bitcoin was supposed to be.  However I acknowledge that a lot has changed since that time, and new knowledge has been gained that contradicts some of my early opinions.  For example I didn\'t anticipate pooled mining and its effects on the security of the network.  Making Bitcoin a competitive monetary system while also preserving its security properties is not a trivial problem, and we should take more time to come up with a robust solution.  I suspect we need a better incentive for users to run nodes instead of relying solely on altruism.\n\nIf two developers can fork Bitcoin and succeed in redefining what "Bitcoin" is, in the face of widespread technical criticism and through the use of populist tactics, then I will have no choice but to declare Bitcoin a failed project.  Bitcoin was meant to be both technically and socially robust.
