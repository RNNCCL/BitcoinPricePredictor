And they can still have control over it at the institution using multi-signature.  They cannot do this with cash because the trail can only be tracked so far and they rely on archaic imaging systems to track where cash ends up at banks and that doesn't show the complete picture of who touched it both at the bank and by the consumer.

Eventually that will end up going through a banks blockchain and it will be tied to a user, that users identity will be enumerated and they will be able to track it through the banks(governments) blockchain to its exit on the bitcoin blockchain.

": 3, "The are so many useful applications of Factom technology for the medical industry!!  On the one hand, it can help create a unified database, if you will, WITHOUT centralization.  Meaning that for the longest time, people have tried to centralize medical info and naturally, for very good reasons (which I personally support) this isn't a good idea from a technical stand point as well as ethical/moral reasons.  However with Factom and blockchain technology, we can achieve that outcome but the medical information won't be centralized and thus won't be vulnerable to hacks/abuse ala credit card hacking we see every month.  Once your medical data is exposed, it can't be put back in the bottle, if I may use that metaphor.  (If your identity or credit info is compromised, after painful 6 months, you can restore and fix it, but you can't put back an exposure of some medical condition you may have, it's out...)  Also it will give the consumer/patient control and security of access to their medical info.  Patients can control with their doctors who gets access to their info as needed in the continuum of care on a granular level.  These are just a few of some high level ideas for the consumer facet of our healthcare system.  On the other hand, solutions for fraud in claims and waste in processing infrastructure are geared towards the payer/provider facet.  For example we can secure a claim to show that services that are being billed did occur and the insurance company does not need to ask for nurses notes, super bill etc... to audit a claim.  Many insurance companies do this, including Medicare and Medicaids.  This is very inefficient and it costs billions.  Then, there's the whole facet of collections (agency or not) and reimbursement and determining benefits and eligibility prior to medical services being performed (being able to prove that a payer said a member is eligible for XYZ and they can't say no we didn't).  Explanation of benefits comes to mind, secondary claim processing, discharge protocols, follow up care and adherence to disease management protocols etc...
