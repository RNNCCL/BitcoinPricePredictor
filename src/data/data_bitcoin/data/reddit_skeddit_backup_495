I heard the following analogy: imagine there was a road that could transport you to any country on Earth without having to pass through any border checks, without any sea or rough terrain. Such a road (Bitcoin network) would clearly have a lot of value to some people, and they would therefore be willing to pay for the tokens (bitcoins) to be allowed to use the road.\n\n> Bitcoin also could be said to have non-monetary value in creating the most reliable notary service on Earth; for some particular minimum number of satoshis you can enter a hash into the blockchain which irreversibly and incontrovertibly proves the existence of data.\n\nYou are completely wrong.  Yes, there are tons of myths about how Bitcoin gets value, because predators need more fools to sell off coins to.  But nothing you mentioned has any theoretical valuation mechanism.\n\nAnd there is overwhelming body of research that shows exactly how Bitcoin gets valuation.  Every new research analysis published keeps coming to the same conclusion.  No matter the data looked at, the reason stands out clear.  Several researchers actually came in with the belief that there may be value transactionally (typically because they lacked the technical understanding that no valuation can occur this way because the protocol may be duplicated into altcoins at zero fundamental cost), but their research changed their minds.\n\nSpeculation\n\n\n\n"Is Bitcoin a Real Currency?"\nDavid Yermack\nDecember 1, 2013\n\n"In this research note, I argue that Bitcoin does not behave like a currency at all.

Order now and we will throw in a free 28g!" along the top... So everyone gets that extra, not just the bitcoin community...? This would confuse visitors to your site, both regular ones and ones from the bitcoin community.

This is worth is weight in gold, it makes keeping track of passwords (and creating new ones) a breeze. I highly recommend it. It's very secure--dashlane only stores your data encrypted on their servers and only you can decrypt it with your master password. This is the password to everything. If you lose it you're fucked. Dashlane can't help you.\n\n3. Now I need to get my family my master password when I'm gone. This is where Google's Inactive acct manager kicks in to notify them of (a) my login ID (b) where to find my master password. You can write your master password in a physical location somewhere they can access. Perhaps written inside a closet in your parents house. Perhaps etched in the shed behind your brother's house. Somewhere where no one would notice it, or even know what it is should they see it. It's just a jumble of characters. Also a good thing about Dashlane is that you can't use if from a new unauthorized device. They would need access to one of your devices. (You can perhaps describe in the Google email how to get into your devices, if that's password protected too.)\n\nWith this approach someone would need all 3 to get your stuff. (1) google automated email (2) access to physical location where master password is (3) access to your physical device.\n\nI like this approach because it's not just bitcoin specific.

Within your account you can assign individuals as an inheritor to certain documents or passwords.\n\nIn the event of your death, the holder can activate the inheritance process and during that time, you will receive emails ( or other means of communication, depending on your subscription ) to contend your death.\n\nIf your death is not contended, the individual(s) will get access to the corresponding information that you assigned after a configurable period.\n\nI personally like this approach as it allows me to keep my assets secure but provide enough information for my family to access my resources accordingly.\n\nUsing Bitcoin as an example, lets say that you have a BIP38 paper wallet that is accessible by yourself and your trusted person ( i.e. you have arranged ahead of time that your wallet is stored in your filing cabinet ) .\n\nIn securesafe, you can store BIP38 passphrase, assigning your trusted person as an inheritor.  You could also create and assign an associated document with instructions that can be leveraged ( in the case of a paper wallet, you might want to include considerations like sweeping the whole wallet or advising them to seek out help from a certain trusted friend ).\n\nThis kind of solution can become very effective when it's combined with other solutions.

At any time before then, you can spend any of the inputs to the time-locked transaction. This makes the time-locked transaction invalid forever because using it would be a double-spend. If you fail to invalidate the time-locked transaction before its LockTime, then the beneficiary can broadcast it and it works like any normal transaction.\n\nCurrently there's no way to create a time-locked transaction using Bitcoin Core directly, though you can create a raw transaction with Bitcoin Core, manually mess with the bytes to add a lock time and change at least one input sequence number, and then have Bitcoin Core sign it.
