Bitcoin is far larger than you imagine, counting exchanges alone there are hundreds of them globally, expect them to all get prepared and upgraded within a narrow schedule stretches belief. Counting the number of full nodes, which every user really relies on to know if they are on the right chain and thus avoid double spending, you don\'t have more than a few.\n\n2.  Even if you really have an "overwhelming majority" the phrase you oh like to use it so much, you still should not push for a hard-fork, because any unupgraded node would not accept the larger blocks, and it\'s almost inevitable someone relying on these nodes to confirm their transactions would end up getting double-spent, as both theory and history show. In the 2013 accidental hard-fork due to a database bug, the overwhelming majority was indeed with one chain, yet OkPay(you even knew they use Bitcoin? Further reinforces the point you have no idea what the majority is thinking) still end up getting double-spent, though fortunately it was benevolent. So unless the core full node count goes down to negligible level(i.e., single digits), a hard fork carries high risk to cause real monetary losses for people. But judging by responses to me from many big blockers, they apparently could live with such man-made disasters as long as they get the bigger blocks they want.\n\n': 2}, ('What will happen to large scale miners if/when a switch to Classic happens.
