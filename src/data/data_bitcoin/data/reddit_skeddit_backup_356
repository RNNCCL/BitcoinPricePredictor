Some of those holders are deposit institutions like exchanges, so the one true mob moment will be the forum posts urging withdrawals once these institutions take such positions. The addresses that they pledge to any one side of the fight will then be a lot smaller.\n\nThis situation is coming down to a economic proof of stake vote with all of the cartel-formation downsides that proof of stake entails. It\'s not pretty, but there\'s no talking it back. The one upside on public perception is that if lots of coins are pledged to war, the market will clear in favour of one and only one chain very quickly and people will be able to say "the market worked it out".\n\nYes, the world will see that a cartel formed and pushed its coin weight around. But, stake based cartels are very hard to form and hold together, so hopefully people will understand that just because such a cartel formed around block size doesn\'t mean it can easily form around any other issue.\n\nWho\'s to say by forum noise alone that the economic majority favours BIP 101 over the status quo? (not sure if those are the two options to ideally put to vote)\n\nSome off chain proof of stake signaling is equally an opportunity for major coin holders opposed to a particular blocksize hard fork to stake vote their opinion and willingness to fight.\n\nSimilarly, we may discover that a big block cartel is all hot air and lacks the unity of bite to get the job done. My thesis is that it is not a strong enough signal to pledge to run a particular node and just ignore the other chain as long as there are other economic actors still on it. Ditto for the other side. Pledging to fork coins and dump the unfavoured one is a much more powerful signal.\n\nIt\'s going to take a lot of coin weight signaled as I\'ve described to make this happen. I agree that too many neutral, unpledged coins makes for a risky situation for any cartel to ignore.\n\nA winning cartel needs to be very very big, very willing to stick together, and very willing to fight. I don\'t believe one exists until some signatures attached to very big stake are made.': 1, "you have it backwards,\nSidechaes are not Bitcoin. \n\nAdam Back is an employee who didn't think Bitcoin was relevant or a good idea until 2013. \n": 1, '*stomps feet even harder*': -4, 'For the network to be useful, full nodes will need to update as well.

If smaller mining pool B does a block withholding attack with a small piece of hashpower, B will disrupt A so that maybe it then earns only 30 blocks/day on average. This means 1.68 blocks become open to be discovered by other pools. If B was the #2 mining pool and remains #2 in hashrate, even after using some of its hashrate for the attack, then it will still have a higher probability than the other pools of earning the rewards from those now-available 1.68 blocks.\n\nIf pool A is not aware of attacks (because attacks can be anonymous), but it knows attacks are possibly reducing its profit, then it makes sense for A to also reserve some amount of hashrate to attack a pool (to try to negate the possible advantage being secretly gained by the other pool).\n\ndisclaimer: I'm no expert on mining, but this is what seems logical on the surface.": 4, 'https://freedom-to-tinker.com/blog/randomwalker/bitcoin-and-game-theory-were-still-scratching-the-surface/': 2, 'Anyone care to explain "anonymous block withholding attack"?': 1, "That's exactly why people saying huge banks could never sabotage bitcoin are kidding themselves or ignorant. \n\nSmart people in a category worth trillions...

This seems false to me. An attacker does not have to approximate the hash of target ID. It should be sufficient to get closer to it than any other members of the network, so the difficulty would just scale with the number of network participants.': 1, 'The password analogy is actually a really good one. Many moons ago we thought that storing an MD5 of a password was just fine. Then lookup tables (and eventually rainbow tables) came along, and we realised that cracking it was trivial, so we added a salt to the MD5 to defeat that. Then brute-force and dictionary attacks against MD5 and SHA1 became so powerful that we switched to SHA512 / RipeMD / SHA3 etc. Still this is not really enough, and so we enhance it with key stretching algorithms like PBKDF2 / bcrypt / scrypt.\n\nThe key here is that the strength of individual passwords is largely irrelevant (all it does is make it slightly harder for an attacker, but processing power and access to it continues to increase), and once a password hash is leaked it\'s too late to do anything about it. All you can do is hope that the attacker doesn\'t manage to crack your particular password, bearing in mind that they have a virtually infinite amount of time to do so.\n\nNow consider that the Bitcoin ledger is a dataset of N records. Because of address reuse, this dataset doesn\'t grow quite as rapidly as we\'d like. Thus, again, analysts / attackers have virtually unlimited time to try and "crack" that dataset.\n\nNow here\'s the thing: the metadata that an attacker has that they use to reveal information about Bitcoin transactions is also ever-growing. Sometimes it\'s by scraping posts on forums / Reddit / Twitter where people mention their address or a transaction ID of theirs, sometimes it\'s by grabbing data from hacks, sometimes it\'s by labels being added to blockchain.info and similar, sometimes it\'s by law enforcement exposing information (legally obtained or not). The more metadata they have, the more they can infer from Bitcoin\'s ledger.\n\nThus the privacy of your transactions is rarely dependent on your personal opsec, as it can be compromised and revealed (over time) by an attacker\'s ever-growing metadata. And unlike passwords, which are somewhat transient and irrelevant, an attacker eventually figuring out that you are responsible for a particular transaction (even many, many years later) could endanger your life, reveal your religious affiliations, leak your sordid purchases, provide information to advertisers they previously wouldn\'t have been able to get, put you in prison, highlight confidential supplier relationships, or make you the focus of targeted crime.': 6}, ('ECB Raises Emergency Lending to Greek Banks by $984 Million', 8): {"WSJ can suck it...

I asked what papaerwork? I submit no paperwork when exchanging btc other than my identity which you have because you seized the site and all their information. She then explained that you just need to submit paperwork that you were buying btc from them. I said well thats fine and dandy but I mine BTC and there is no paperwork however they pay me so the site clearly has records of who has what moneies on their account. This is when it gets ridiculous. \n\nShe explains to me that the records of the site are not public information so I cannot use that information. I explained that that is the only place that records exist. How can you seize all the records that exist and then ask me to provide information that you have and won't release? Thats when she started acting like I was a criminal. She took all my information and Im quite sure I will now be investigatyed and Im quite sure that it will not be to facilitate the return of my btc. She then told me that I could contact the FBI and they would know what regulation I could point to in order to avoid this in the future. The FBI knows nothing of this and told me to call the DA in New York again. Basically what they are saying is that I am screwed. They can point to no policy or guidlines I could use to avoid using a site that is in violation of policies that no one can even point me to or even exist to my knowledge. Once again the US gov't has turned its back on a developing technology and given no clear guidance. They are great at finding ways to then sieze funds of innocent people but cannot be proactive and release guidance on avoiding such situations by people that have no intent nor deisre to break any laws. Im finding it really hard these days to get behind the US and like I said Im born and raised. The gov't is supposed to be of the people for the people. Instead its just a huge beast that continues to do everything it can to support itslef including seizing any funds it can that either fall in to a grey area or where citizens just dont bother trying to recover their funds. So now no one in the gov't can point me to any guidance on avoiding this. Im not doing anything illegal.

The owners of this site are being made out to be some huge conspiracy involved in funding criminal enterprises, money laundering, etc. In fact I get the feeling now that these are just guys that were trying to run a business and werent aware of what filings were necessary or what responsibilites were required of them by the gov't. This is just a case of these guys not knowing that they had to file a bunch of red tape stuff. They just wanted to open a site and exchange what no one considers to be an official form of currency. Why would you think that money tansfer or exchange laws would be involved when the US has come out and said that its not currency? These were not huge criminals, terrorists, or money launderers. I feel for them actually. \n\nWell I encourage you to call the NY DA. I dont know if any of us will have any luck in getting our funds back because the US gov't is set to keep it.
