No screen. We have developed a hardened bluetooth protocol, with diffie hillman key agreement driving additional AES encryption, message signing and embedded HMAC OTP ( one time passwords ), to ensure only authenticated devices can connect to BitStash. In addition, all BIP32 keys are stored on BitStash encrypted with the user's password ( after 2,000 rounds of PDFDF2 extension ) , so rebalancing prompts the authenticated device for the password, to perform the transaction. \n\nThere is no screen, everything happens via your mobile or desktop app. The embedded HMAC OTP ( using a secret shared on device authorization ) plus the user password ensures authentication. If you authorize multiple devices, you have the option of specifying 2 factor authentication, so an attempt to spend on the desktop for instance would require password entry on your phone. With a single device, the HMAC OTP can be set as a CAPTCHA, requiring human input to decode and enter.\n\nThe entire device is built to meet the FIPS 140-2 level 3 requirements. So all our BIP32 elliptic curve algos, software, hardened bluetooth, device anti-tamper circuitry, will be certified to meet that standard, at a cost of about 100k, not including our time. \n\nWe are trying to solve bitcoin key security once and for all.

I think not.\n\nWhere did you get that idea? Please stop making straw man arguments.': 1, "Sorry for delay, EST time here, so was late at night. \n\nOk, there are four components used to prevent this issue.\n\nOne,  each bluetooth message must be signed by an authorized device. BitStash generates a deviceId and a public private key key for each device authorized. Messages must be signed with the appropriate private key to be accepted.  \n\nSo not any device can talk to BitStash, only those that have been authorized by the user.\n\nTwo, BitStash generates a unique shared secret for each authorized device. The shared secret is used to generate a HMAC OTP, one time use password. A message must contain the correct generated OTP to be accepted. It must be signed. So the combination prevents message replay for being allowed.\n\nThe Shared Secret and Signing Key are encrypted on BitStash using the user's 4 digit PIN, chosen along with password on setup, and sent to the authorized client device on setup. The PIN is needed to unlock./open the application and access these variables. The happens when the user opens our Applications. The PIN is also used on mobile devices for spending from the mobile wallet, as their private keys are stored encrypted on the mobile device with that PIN ( PDFDF2 extended 2k rounds ). \n\nThree, all transaction signing messages must include the PASSWORD, THE OTP and the SIGNATURE, plus the correct deviceId. The actual keys are stored encrypted on the device, and the PASSWORD is needed to decrypt them.\n\nWITHOUT all three pieces it is not possible to sign a transaction. \n\nTo prevent keylogger software installed on the CLIENT from capturing a user's password, two additional features can be enabled. First the HMAC OTP can be set as a CAPTCHA. This means a human must read it and type it into the field. \n\nSecond 2factor authentication can be used, where a second authorized device is used. Unlike other 2factor authentication schemes, this does not involve a text message or third party, but that the second device be physically in range of the bitStash, paired with it and then the user simply uses that device to enter the password when prompted. In BIP70 payment scenario, the user would click the BIP70 payment link on the merchant site, and then complete simply by entering their password when prompted on their phone. Pretty seamless, and less work than existing 2factor solutions.\n\nThese settings are stored on BitStash, so cannot be changed without a user's password\n\nFinally, BitStash is set to go into a sleep mode after 3 invalid password/pin attempts. This means it will accept no transactions for a configurable period of time after three attempts. In addition repeated continuous entry into sleep mode can cause BitStash to self destruct, frying the eMMc. \n\nSo, if you are afraid of a compromised computer with a keylogger, set 2 factor authentication. Then executing a transaction is a simple as entering your password on your phone when prompted. (You will have needed the PIN to unlock the application, but will not need to enter a password on the first client device in this case ).\n\nAs far as what the device accomplishes, other than just software. All the keys are generated in the device, as hardened BIP32 keys from a core seed, which itself is generated from atmospheric noise based entropy mixed with a PRNG seed and then PDFDF2 extended. With the exception of the hardened mobile signing key, the keys never leave the device. The device cannot be compromised either through its Bluetooth or USB interfaces and if tampered with, will destroy the keys. So, the device is true secure storage for those keys. Unique BIP32 address are generated for each receiving transaction using the extended hardened public key shared with each authorized device. The device also stores off blockchain information, like notes on transactions, BIP70 payment information etc, and keeps authorized devices in sync with each other when in range.\n\nYes, using multi-sig transactions, which can be done with BitStash also, with a third party in the middle is a solution to this. And for some financial entities a solution like BitStash plus multisig will be needed ( competing FIPS certified HSMs ( hardware security modules ) cost upwards of 50k ), but for those of us that are NOT comfortable with a third party Standing in the way of us spending our money, either because of a business continuity issue, or some Court Ordered action, BitStash provides the first truly secure way to seamlessly store Bitcoin. No paper wallets, no dongles, accessible from mobile and desktop devices alike.\n\n": 1, "> we strongly suggest 2 factor authentication\n\nThat's good advice.

The value would have to rise exactly at the halving event, or the difficulty will rise to meet it. Otherwise *every miner* will experience negative ROI immediately after the halving event. Only a few miners who are willing to lose money by mining will continue -- the rest will pause until the difficulty drops, which will cause the solution time, and hence the time to difficulty adjustment, to go way up.': 2, 'Exactly.

Even though the halving from 50 to 25 bitcoins went without even a hiccup, I\'m concerned that miners\' profit margins before the halving in 2016 will be so slim (say 5%) that many miners will pause operations after the halving rather than operate at a loss (5% profit would turn into HEAVY loss of perhaps 45%, the amount dependent on the how heavily electricity, cooling and maintenance factors into operating cost). If a large number of miners pause operation (say 95%), then the hash rate would plummet (down 20X), causing new block generation time to skyrocket (again, 20X to 3 hours 20 minutes) and consequently the time to the next difficulty rate adjustment to soar (20X to 40 weeks). I know that critics say that miners will take this into account and adjust accordingly, but no one ever says what they can do to adjust. It will be profitable right up to the halving and then suddenly be very unprofitable, so that only ideologues (and a few with free electricity) will continue mining at the huge loss.\n\nIf you disagee, please don\'t just downvote... explain why this would not occur.\n\nThe solution would be to adjust the reward value more frequently and in smaller amounts so that miners would smoothly adjust.\n\nPlease, I am heavily committed to Bitcoin\'s success and I would like to see this issue addressed.\n\nIf it is not clear how this could happen, consider the following scenario:\n\nBefore the next halving, we might expect that the typical miner is reaping a 5% profit. That means that for every $100 he spends on operating cost, he receives $105 in rewards, for a $5 profit. Immediately after the halving, he will still need to spend the same $100, but will suddenly receive only $52.50 in rewards (remember, the difficulty is not yet adjusted), for a net **loss** of $47.50, or an ROI of -47.5%. Who will continue to mine at a loss like that? And who would stop mining earlier, when a profit can still be realized?\n\nEDIT:\n\nA critic of my scenario replied last time I posted that this will not be a problem, because miners who use "expensive" electricity will simply sell their rigs to miners using "near-free" electricity.\n\nBut I contend that this shake-out of expensive electricity users will already have occurred by 2016, and only near-free users will remain. Even the near-free users will be barely eking out a small profit, due to the difficulty adjustments.

The "unnatural" part of high bitcoin price comes from speculative investment, I agree we don\'t need the price based on that.': 3, '"*Compartmentalization is an unconscious psychological defense mechanism used to avoid cognitive dissonance, or the mental discomfort and anxiety caused by a person\'s having conflicting values, cognitions, emotions, beliefs, etc. within themselves.*\n\n*Compartmentalization allows these conflicting ideas to co-exist by inhibiting direct or explicit acknowledgement and interaction between separate compartmentalized self states.*" -Wikipedia\n\nThis whole exercise is an attempt to reframe what bitcoin is and what it can do. Like most things, this is not a black or white two choice subject. \n\nWhy can\'t it be worth trillions of dollars and still be useful? You simply can\'t move hundreds of millions of dollars into and out of bitcoin right now without moving the market. That is a problem. It can only be solved by growing the pool of liquidity much larger than it is today. Whether or not that will actually ever happen is what all the speculation is about. \n\nWide acceptance will probably mean payment processors do most of the heavy lifting.

If bitcoin reaches wide acceptance, than the price will go up, purely due to an increased number of users and a limited supply. (Demand shifts to the right) The contrapositive statements you make have no evidence whatsoever. In truth, if bitcoin becomes widely used, it will be proven that the price will increase due to a higher demand of bitcoins, even if only for utility.\n\nSomething to think about, if one person is to value bitcoin based on utility and another person values bitcoin based on a store of value, and if bitcoin is moving towards widespread use, would these not both increase the price of bitcoin? \n\nThe person that values bitcoin purely for the utility of bitcoin will most likely hold a small amount of bitcoin and only buy bitcoin when they want to use it. I feel that a lot of bitcoin users are at this stage, which makes perfect sense. The idea is that if enough people are using bitcoin like this, and due to a limited supply of bitcoin, the price will increase purely on the demand of the many recognizing value through utility.\n\nIn the case that someone is buying bitcoin for an investment or a store of value, if wide acceptance occurs and a lot of people are buying bitcoin as a store of value, there will be less coins on exchanges leading to a higher price per coin.": 3, ">If someone launches crapcoin and there is a 500 trillion limit on them, Bitcoin becomes worthless.\n\nWhy, in this fantasy scenario, did crapcoin displace Bitcoin?

Utility requires liquidity. Liquidity at $1000 is far greater than at $1. There's a reason why many altcoins at much lower prices are much less useful than bitcoin. Namely, there's a bigger market.\n\n2. The mechanism relies on network hashing power. The higher the price, the more incentive for miners. This is another thing bitcoin has over all the other altcoins, namely, a much larger network hash rate. The larger hash rate (that is, more miners and mining power in general) secures the network. The mechanism works a lot better (that is, in a much more secure way) when the price is higher. Witness all the altcoins that have basically been ruined by miners that brought great hashing power and then left.\n\nPrice matters. To claim otherwise simply is ignoring all the incentives that make up the whole system.

If they need bitcoins, they are going to be affected by the swings created by people holding onto their bitcoins.\n\nIf an alternative with no supply restrictions is there, they are likely to find that more attractive.\n\nThis isn't going to happen to everyone. If I need Bitcoin right now to buy something, I just buy it at whatever the market is, it doesn't matter, I'm going to spend it straight away, so I'm effectively still working in Fiat.\n\nThe logic here is where I started - the value of the bitcoin is separate from the mechanisms that allow them to function.
