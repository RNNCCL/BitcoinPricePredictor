"This idea you can have two parties that don\'t know each other come together and have a seamless, frictionless transaction at very little to no cost, in a decentralised environment, is revolutionary. Institutional interest is going to continue to grow."\n\nGenesis\' move to focus on bitcoin is part of a broader embrace of digital assets by figures on Wall Street.\n\nLast month Blythe Masters, the former JPMorgan executive who helped pioneer credit derivatives in the 1990s, said she was launching a venue for buyers and sellers of financial assets to meet and transact, switching currencies into bitcoin in order to cut the time and cost of settlement, while making use of the decentralised \'blockchain\' as a secure record of transactions.\n\nSecondMarket made its name offering a private market in Facebook shares before the initial public offering. It will continue to trade a range of illiquid assets, from auction-rate securities to bankruptcy claims to student loans.

That has not happened to any coin last year I think.\n\nSo basically: A VC firm has a higher chance of success, since they can sieve out the obvious scams.

Consumers would immediately flock to the product and snap it up.\n\nUltimately the "average Joe" will want Bitcoin, though.  It\'ll take a while for him to realize it.  That\'s because hypermonetization starts with the elites (both intellectual and economic) and then makes its way down to the middle and left of the IQ bell curve.  Those people will continue to hoard dollars, euros, yen, yuan, etc... until doing so becomes prohibitively expensive and tedious (ie inflation and capital controls kick in).  Then they\'ll demand a money that\'s more "real".\n\nBut by the time that happens, Bitcoin will already be firmly entrenched among the intellectuals and techno-savvy.

Decentralized on the other hand means you have your own car and you have the freedom to take any route you want, or leave at exactly the time you like.\n\nSo freedom really does have its advantages; I live in Europe and while you can certainly use public transport, there are plenty of people that own their own car.\n\nBack to Bitcoin.

No offense.\n\n> However, the government does not horde the dollars paid to it via taxation, so this effect is negated.\n\nNo it's not.  Regardless of what the government does with the currency once it collects it, you need to have it to pay taxes.\n\nHere's a [source](http://www.thomaspalley.com/docs/articles/macro_theory/mmt.pdf) ^warning ^pdf : \n> The MMT approach to sovereign fiat money is the Chartalist approach developed\nby Knapp (1924), which was also accepted by Keynes (1930). Chartalist theory maintains government issued fiat money has value because governments demand taxes be paid in sovereign money, thereby creating public demand it. \nThis idea that the demand for sovereign money is in part due to the obligation to use it to pay taxes is uncontroversial.\n\nHere's [another](http://mmtwiki.org/wiki/Tax): \n\n> The other reason for federal taxes is to create demand for the currency.[2] Once a currency has already been established, this reason isn\xe2\x80\x99t as obvious. To understand this concept you we must go back to the launch of a brand new currency. Let\xe2\x80\x99s say Ireland decided to dump the Euro and create a new currency called \xe2\x80\x98quid\xe2\x80\x99. The Irish government would make a bunch of quid and then try to use it hire someone to sweep the streets of Dublin. What they would find is that no one was willing to word for quids, no matter how many were offered because everyone would still be using Euros. \n\n> Ireland finds that it must artificially create a demand for quid. They do this by declaring that all taxes must be paid in quid. Suddenly, people need quid. People are now willing to work for the government in exchange for quid. They can make the quid they need to pay their taxes and then sell their excess quid to people who don\xe2\x80\x99t work for the government, but must still pay their taxes in quid. In exchange for their quid, the workers could get Euro\xe2\x80\x99s(an example of a foreign exchange market) or goods and services(a plain old money transaction). The amount of Euro\xe2\x80\x99s and goods they get for their quid is negotiated by the market. After a time the currency will take hold and the Irish government will find it can pay for anything it wants in quid. As long as people MUST pay their taxes using quid, there will be a demand for quid. \n\nSo lets address this next part:\n\n> If the US government stopped taxing people and also stopped spending dollars, the demand for the dollar would necessarily increase because there would be fewer of them coming into circulation.\n\nNo; you can't say it would *necessarily* increase because you haven't justified where the demand *comes from in the first place*. \n\n>  Now suppose that every year the Vikings sold/traded/exchanged MORE seashells than it required in the form of tribute. The value of seashells would of course decline because this situation, when viewed in its entirety would not generate demand for them.\n\nBut if the Vikings didn't demand seashells for taxes, then why would anyone accept their seashells for payment?
