One reason could be a strong network effect, similar to facebook being a standard app on every mobile phone. Or like a GPS chip, because so many apps depend on it. \n\nIn any way, for this to become a success, there needs to be a large number of users, and possibly a large number of apps build on the infrastructure developed by 21. To achieve this, they need to attract a lot of people, at this stage early adopters, who will try something new for the appeal of using something new in itself.

In the meantime, if you like hacking stuff go ahead and apply for a job at [21.co/jobs](https://21.co/jobs). Or, if you _really_ don\'t have money and are a student or otherwise have demonstrable financial need, contact support@21.co and we\'ll see what we can do.\n\n**Longer version**\n\nGo download this and try this out while you can! But just as an FYI, off-device use in this fashion is going to be disabled in the next versions of the software ([21 update](https://21.co/learn/21-command-line-interface/#updating-the-21-command-line-using-the-cli)) as we\'ll be asking the 21 client for proof-of-work, among other things, which will require a 21 Bitcoin Computer with a mining chip.\n\nIf you do install the 21 update, which is free for everyone with the 21 Bitcoin Computer, you won\'t see anything change plus you\'ll get a bunch of bug fixes and new stuff.\n\nIf you don\'t install the 21 update (and you can\'t if you\'re off-device), then most functionality in the old 21 client will be disabled -- including anything that contacts the server side, including 21 status and so on. You also won\'t be able to join the [21 Network](https://21.co/learn/21-marketplace/#the-21-network) to do peer-to-peer transactions or publish to the [21 Marketplace](https://21.co/learn/21-marketplace) when that functionality is released without a 21 Bitcoin Computer as those will be doing the same checks.\n\n**Reasons**\n\nI want to make clear that we\'re not doing this *just* because we\'re pure evil (though there is always that, muhuhaha!). We actually have several good reasons:\n\n1) First, we want to support a clean full stack environment for Bitcoin programming. That\'s made much easier if our 21 update is installing on the same piece of hardware on every node in the network, and if the packages you install are all compiled for the same architecture, and so on. We are trying to build the first standardized Bitcoin environment that Just Works (tm); that\'s made easier if we can lock down the hardware. As Alan Kay put it, [\xe2\x80\x9cPeople who are really serious about software should make their own hardware.\xe2\x80\x9d](http://techland.time.com/2013/04/02/an-interview-with-computing-pioneer-alan-kay/)\n\n2) Second, we want to make sure that the first group of buyers and sellers in the [21 Marketplace](https://21.co/learn/21-marketplace) are folks who\'ve bought a 21 Bitcoin Computer. This ensures a higher basal level of trust and will be one of the first functioning digital goods marketplaces using Bitcoin -- which will be good for Bitcoin.\n\n3) Third, as we\'ll get into in a blog post, the fact that the 21 Bitcoin Computer is also usable as an inexpensive little *home server* is key. It means you can leave it on and have it service requests in the background. A laptop really isn\'t built for that - if you close the lid, your buyer can\'t reach you. [EDIT: By "close the lid", we mean "close the lid and pick it up and walk away". Laptops aren\'t made to be up 24/7; if you use them as servers, they are no longer mobile or as useful as laptops. Moreover, client-side reboots initiated by you as a user will affect the customers of your server, etc.] You can always go cloud, but that\'s now a fair bit more effort + nonzero cost, and many of the interesting things you can do with Bitcoin may not be possible if you\'re using an AWS IP (like the [HTTP proxy example](https://21.co/learn/bitcoin-payable-http-proxy)). \n\n4) Fourth, many of the techniques we\'re using here (as well as others) will be used to protect you as a seller if you get a 21 Bitcoin Computer and are selling digital goods and services in the 21 Marketplace. You will probably experience a higher attempted double spend rate, for example, if selling a digital good to someone who didn\'t buy a device. As a seller you\'ll have a different worldview.\n\n5) Fifth, we actually DO have a pretty good open source package that we\'ll be releasing in the not-too-distant future which will be complementary to what you get on the 21 Bitcoin Computer. We just want to release that in a careful and thought-through way. I do subscribe to Tom Preston-Werner\'s dictum of ["Open Source Almost Everything"](http://tom.preston-werner.com/2011/11/22/open-source-everything.html), but where and when is important. We want your open source experience to be a non-buggy one with corner cases solved on enough platforms, so give us a little time.\n\n**Big picture**\n\nWe totally get that it\'s fun to try to circumvent stuff and find holes. This was a pretty obvious thing to try, but we knew it\'d be easy to fix it if it happened, so we\'re fixing it.\n\nJust like you guys, we aren\'t bankers, we are hackers, and we are looking for people who are crazy enough to spend a Friday night reading this thread to try to save a bit of money by downloading and running new kinds of Bitcoin software.\n\nIf you like doing that kind of thing, apply for a job at [21.co/jobs](https://21.co/jobs) and you\'ll definitely make more USD or BTC than you will save by running the software off-device for a few days before we have an update. \n\nAnd we do have a budget for charity and community, so if you really do have a demonstrable financial need (particularly if you are a student or represent an underserved group), get in touch at support@21.co and we\'ll see if we can help you out!': 35, 'I know....': 1, "Just a couple of questions if you're allowed to answer:  is there any plan to just release the mining chip and have a kit of some sorts or was that addressed when you said hardware should be the same like how apple works?

Imagine you were getting small bits of gold instead of bitcoins: many of your questions and concerns would be the same. How do I keep these safe? How can I change them into dollars (or whatever your local currency is)? How come they are worth more or less than they were last month?\n\nYou can either store your bitcoins on your own computer or smartphone using a program or app called a "wallet", or you can ask someone else to store them. In that case you are trusting them not to lose them, and not to run off with them. Most people reckon that you should store them yourself, and its good advice, but you need to do it right. Going back to the bits of gold, imagine if you said "I\'ll keep them in this glass jar on my mantlepiece so I won\'t lose them". Not very secure. But if you bought a lockbox and hid it under a floorboard, or used a proper safe, they would be much more secure. The same thing goes for bitcoins. You can keep them on your everyday computer, but its the equivalent of the glass jar on the mantlepiece. Thats OK for small amounts, like this week\'s groceries, but for bigger amounts you want something more secure. A hardware wallet is the equivalent of the lockbox or safe, and if you are going to have a lot of bitcoins then you ought to get one. Read the instructions carefully, and come back here for advice if you need it. See https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Hardware_wallet for a list of choices.\n\nFor selling your bitcoins there are a number of options. A number of people have mentioned coinbase, and there are other options too.  These are known as exchanges. You sign up with the exchange, transfer some of your bitcoins to them, and then electronically exchange them for dollars which will be transferred back to your bank account. If you are in Europe then BitStamp is a good choice. In all these cases you have to trust the exchange with your money during the process, but you can do it a bit at a time, and its only for a short time, so its a much lower risk than leaving the whole lot with the exchange all the time.\n\nNote that some banks get squirrely about people who get money from bitcoin exchanges; they are afraid you might be earning them in some illegal way and close your account.\n\nSome cities have Bitcoin ATMs where you can sell bitcoins and get cash dispensed directly in return. The exchange rate is usually not very good, but probably better than you get on localbitcoins.com.\n\nLike I said, you can think of bitcoins as being a bit like gold, and just like gold the price goes up and down. There is nobody in charge of this; when you sell bitcoins you are selling them to somebody else who wants to buy them, possibly even the person who is going to wind up paying for whatever it is you do to earn them. Some people also buy them and hold them in the hope that the price will go up. So there is supply and demand, and that is what sets the price. Because Bitcoin is new and not widely used the price can vary a lot very quickly. If you can\'t afford to risk this then you should set up a system to sell your bitcoins as fast as you get them.\n\nHope this helps.': 5, "I'd recommend keeping an independent accounting of how many you received, when, and market price when you received them.\n\nSimilarly, how many you spent, when, and the market price when you spent them.\n\nThat will consolidate your records and greatly simplify tax preparation.\n\nThe market price *can* be retrieved after-the-fact, so it's technically not required.
