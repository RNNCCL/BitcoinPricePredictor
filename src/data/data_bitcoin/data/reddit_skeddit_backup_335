As has already been pointed out, the fee market would cause the cost of writing large amounts of data to the blockchain to vary greatly. There is now also serious talk about how to incentivize full nodes by allowing them to charge SPV clients for data requests, meaning not only would Mega customers have to pay to store their data, but they'd have to pay to retrieve it as well (or operate a full node of their own). In order for Kim Dotcom to operate his business affordably, he'd essentially have to run his own full node, mine his own blocks, and provide a proxy to accessing the data from only his node. He might as well continue doing what he's already doing. It's probably cheaper.\n\nBut let's take the alternative approach. Let's say someone developed an open source file sharing client with a built-in bitcoin wallet.. Something that is likely to happen, but doesn't have much of a business model behind it. This client knows how to write large files to the blockchain, and is able to calculate the appropriate fee based on the fee market, and the client uses SPV+fee (the as-yet un-invented method for compensating full nodes) to find the cheapest node and pay for retrieving data from it. What is the most likely outcome of this system? Does the blockchain get bloated by movie pirates loading 4kHD movies into the blockchain? Pirates aren't going to spend that kind of money to write their files into the blockchain. Some users might pay to download them, but why would you do that when Bittorrent is so much more useful for this?  I think the most likely outcome is that only meaningful files that are actually worth something to the person who wants to store them forever will go into the blockchain. Things like photographic or video evidence of human rights violations, important news articles, digital copies of important works of art and literature.. And these things don't have to be added to the blockchain by the authors..

So if that hypothetical occurs, your 1.0 pre-fork bitcoin has the spending power of $200 post-fork, if you do it right and not blow it.  The only way to get the full spending power of your pre-fork coins is to first manually taint them or use a service that does that for you.   Otherwise, you might spend using Bitcoin-XT for the $120 in value and you would lose the ability to also spend the bitcoin worth $80.': 2, 'A hard fork is caused when a new version of the bitcoin client software accepts blocks which would not be accepted by the previous version of the software, such as blocks that are over 1 MB. The new client starts adding the big blocks to its version of the blockchain but the old client rejects the new blocks as invalid and continues building its blockchain under the old rules, so now the blockchain is forked into two different versions. One version is recognized by people running the old software and one version is recognized by people running the new version. Because there is no universally accepted valid block chain, the lack of unanimous agreement causes confusion and uncertainty and this would most likely be followed by a loss in value.': 1, 'Show me where someone has claimed a fork will result in you losing your bitcoins.': 1, 'This topic is much easier to understand if you think of the big blocks / Bitcoin-XT hard fork as being a new coin, albeit one that has an initial distribution (premine) that matches exactly the Bitcoin distribution at the point of the hardfork.\n\nIf there is full consensus and mining stops on the original chain where the 1MB block size limit was enforced, then great -- this new coin essentially assumes everything that pre-fork Bitcoin had (including market cap, mining capacity, merchant traction, etc.)   But if some mining (e.g., 25% of the pre-fork capacity), stays on the original chain then we have two persistent chains.\n\nSo if you "upgrade" to this Bitcoin-XT client that upgrade causes that client to then know your private keys from your Bitcoin wallet.   So if you had 0.4 bitcoins (BTCs) prior to the hard-fork, after the  fork you can spend 0.4 bitcoins (BTCs) and 0.4 coins on the new coin\'s chain as well.  Let\'s call these new coins BTXs (since it is Bitcoin-XT client).\n\nHowever, if you try to spend your 0.4 BTXs, the transaction created by Bitcoin-XT will also confirm on the original chain where the 1MB limit is still enforced.    So the recipient of your 0.4 BTXs also gets to spend your 0.4 BTCs.     The only way you to get to spend those two coins independently is to "taint" them with coins newly mined after the fork began.  \n\nSo let\'s say you mine or buy at least 0.00000001 units of newly mined BTXs.  You then spend to another bitcoin address from your own wallet the entire wallet balance of 0.40000001 (including fees) BTX, causing the transaction to include as one of the INPUTs the 0.00000001 coin.   This transaction will confirm on the big blocks / Bitcoin-XT chain but will be seen as being invalid on the original chain where the 1MB blocksize limit is still enforced.    So your Bitcoin-XT client will still show just under 0.4 as its balance (0.40000001 less the last transaction\'s fee that was paid).   If you then were to copy the wallet.dat to an installation of Bitcoin Core which still enforces the 1MB blocksize limit (e.g., v0.11.x and earlier) then that will show exactly the 0.4 bitcoin balance you had.  That client will be able to spend 0.4 BTCs without messing with your BTXs, and your Bitcoin-XT client will then be able to spend ~0.4 BTXs without it messing with your BTCs.\n\nSlick, eh?\n\nThat\'s why it is called "catastrophic consensus failure".

You had the ability to spend (i.e., sell on an exchange) those pre-fork coins separately but because you used Bitcoin-XT and spent your coins there, you lost the ability to spend the pre-fork coins on both chains.\n\nI\'ld say that is an example of "losing access to your bitcoins".\n\nSimilarly, if you had coins left with a custodial/hosted wallet (e.g., an exchange like Coinbase, e-wallet like Coinapult, online casino balance, etc. ) you likely only have access to coins that are spendable on the big blocks/Bitcoin-XT side only and will thus lose the additioinal value of your balance in bitcoins spendable on the original chain.\n\nSo yes, if there is not essentially universal consensus, a hard fork will cause people to lose access to their coins.\n': 1, "This I think would make it unlikely to be attempted, wouldn't it?": 1, "I have not addressed that idea but that doesn't sound likely to me; I would guess one would fade away.\n\nBut that doesn't mean anyone is losing their Bitcoin.": -1}, ('What a time to be alive, Telluride, CO', 39): {'[deleted]': 2, 'So you buy somethin or you just that creep taking pictures?': 1, 'Awesome!!

Everyone is still making something, just like a skillful russian - english translation of dostoyevsky stands on its own as a product.\n\nBut for the most part, a mathmetician or an engineer could be writing algorithms, and they just need to be implemented correctly in code. I\'ve done a lot of work with middle market companies, and the market for flow meters is massive and lucrative. Engineers are designing different ultrasonic and infrared methods for more accurately metering water and airflow throughout a building, and then communicating that information with the other meters and central control through a network to improve efficiency, pricing, and identifying negative heat delta. \n\nThe least interesting part of those examples, to me, is the implementation. Someone had a great idea, bizdev guys analyzed the market demand, elasticity of demand, product positioning, and the tech and market guys put together a great product. Then you go get your little software scribe who had nothing to do with anything - he\'s just there to translate your product into code. \n\nBack to my initial example of SaaS linked servers - say you have a slightly better idea as a software engineer, like mesh networks. What the fuck do you know about the mesh network market? what do they know about the incumbent products, supply structure, go to market strategies, or sales process? Do they know anything about consumer adoption rates for similar products and what the inflection point is across consumer groups? Most importantly, how the fuck is this thing gonna make money in a sustainable way so that it continues to operate? Straight dev guys might be smart and know a lot of about software engineering, but they don\'t have any content in their head to take an idea from "a mesh network is a cool idea" to "this is how we build mesh networks." My examples are mostly on the finance side cuz that\'s what i know most about.\n\nMy point is that devs are just little translators, like the union guys working the line at an auto manufacturing plant. They didn\'t do anything interesting, they\'re just building the shit. The only reason that they generate such high incomes (relatively) is because the demand for their services is far outstripping supply. However, that\'s quickly going to reach an equilibrium as:\n\n1. code becomes easier and easier to write and perhaps automatically generated (labor supply rises), \n2. markets become more accessible and trade increases (outsourcing to foreign countries) and \n3. emerging markets increase their own supply of devs, synergistically with #2': 3, '> **meth**\n\nFTFY': 1, 'So u think it few months of bootcamping in coding makes u a light yrs ahead of developers.

That is: anyone can claim any vote as their own, since they can sign with the (now public) private key... as long as one person voted for the desired (by the coercer) address, a coerced voter can claim that vote as their own... thus providing plausible claim to have voted in the desired (by the coercer) direction, when. in reality, they voted in accordance to their own will. \n\nA small problem exists still since since the coercer can demand that the coerced voter must put the transaction into the blockchain at an afore-agreed-upon time... but this could be remedied by requiring that all voting occur within one block-period. *(this re-opens the hole related to people having plenty of time and confirmations to verify the blockchain properly registered their transaction... there is room for optimization, however, as long as someone makes a vote for each party at least once-per-block, this might not be a problem...)': 2, 'too much javascript': 2, "One may argue the community doesn't know what's best for them.
