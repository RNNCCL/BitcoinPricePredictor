': 1, "When using Bitcoin Core, the app will generate a series of addresses to use for sending and receiving BTC.

That\'s probably why some of the early, big name people have been jailed. Everyone foolishly thought it was anonymous money until doors started getting kicked in around the world. \n\nUsing the same IP address to repeatedly move BTC earned from illegal activities into the same Bitcoin address is like a Christmas present to the feds if they know you\'re up to no good and are building a case against you. ': 1, "> Does this have something to do with the block-chain?\n\nYour wallet software is downloading the blockchain and, in your example, would still need to download all of the blocks from March 2014 to today. Electrum (and other wallets like it) doesn't need to do that because the blockchain is hosted by their network and only requires the wallet to sync up to the latest block instead of downloading all of them.": 1, 'Historically, people like to use safe deposit boxes as a metaphor for Bitcoin addresses. But these boxes are clear, extremely secure and out in the open -- not locked in the back of a bank. They have unique serial numbers on the outside and deposit slots. Anyone can deposit money into any box and can also see the balance of any box at any time. There are matching keys linked to every box. The serial number on each key corresponds to the serial number listed on the box that key can open. You can calculate the number on the box using the number on the key but you absolutely cannot determine the number on the key just by looking at the number on the box. Anyone can see how much money is inside the box, but no one can open them without the key that you possess.\n\nAs Bitcoin matured, it became the norm for software to change the address (use a different box) after each transaction.. no matter whether spending or receiving BTC. So each time you spend BTC, you remove the entire balance from the box that was holding your balance at the time, put some in a different box -- say, one owned by another person -- and then put the remaining balance in another box that you own. Then each time someone wants to send some BTC to you, your software knows the NEXT box you\'re going to use and tells you the address. That way, when the BTC arrives, the software will again remove the entire balance from the box currently holding your balance, add the new incoming BTC to it, and then put the entire new balance in the next box.\n\nIf I described that clearly enough,  you\'ll soon see why most people around here talk about the importance of using a new address for each transaction. If someone happens to see you put money in a box, they may not know whether its a box you own or not, but they\'ll know how much is in there. Then, by constantly moving parts and pieces of your entire balance to new boxes every time you touch your BTC, that person may come back to check the balance in the box they saw you use but it is now empty; the balances are long gone. They can see where the bits and pieces of your balance went to various other boxes, but unless they see you using the key to unlock a specific box they have no idea whatsoever about the relationship between you and the box or boxes they know are somehow tied to you. It very quickly becomes difficult to "follow the money" as it splits and rejoins other BTC in numerous other somewhat anonymous boxes.\n\nWhen you see people talking about the "12 words" around here, that is a mechanism that makes it easy for your software to calculate millions of addresses to use when moving your balances around. On their own, the addresses appear to be completely unrelated to one another, so it is impossible to figure out all of the addresses you have already used or plan to use just by looking at any number of the addresses. They will never give away their pattern. It is much safer to use a different address each time you send and receive BTC and it is much safer to use a list of 12 words to generate the list of all of the addresses you will eventually use.\n\nHope this helps, but I understand if it doesn\'t :)': 2, 'I don\'t know if you\'ve already read my answer about "are addresses like bank accounts?" but I realized I never answered your first question. Your wallet gets the history from other people running the full version of the client, just like you. That\'s why it is important to open port 8333 on your firewall and forward it to the machine where you\'re running Core. Clients broadcast a transaction into "the network" which in turn asks multiple nodes (like yours) to confirm that the attempted transaction is valid. Only full nodes can confirm that an attempted transaction is valid, while miners take valid transactions and permanently append them into the blockchain, ensuring they can never be altered, reversed or that a user cannot spend the same BTC more than once. Nodes do not get paid to verify that attempted transactions are legitimate, but miners do get paid to guarantee forever that BTC that was already spent cannot be spent again. The two work hand in hand to create "the Bitcoin network".\n\nBefore I go any further: don\'t get me wrong about being paid to mine. "End user" miners will typically spend about $500 on equipment and $400/month in electricity to earn about $40/month in BTC. It is completely not worth it. Again, you will lose a lot of money if you try to mine without spending a ton of money. That being said, there are businesses out there that will run thousands of miners. Their business strategy typically includes selling the BTC they earn from mining. They fill airplane hangars with equipment and are stationed near places with cheap electricity costs in order to squeeze as much profit as possible out of the mining equipment. \n\nFinally, as described elsewhere, there is another kind of wallet or node that does not need to download the entire transaction history. Mobile apps like Mycelium and Breadwallet rely upon servers hosted by the app developers to make life MUCH easier for end users. That convenience comes at the cost of potential security risks for the end user and also puts a demand on the network that is not returned by the user. Electrum on all PC platforms can be used in the same way as the mobile apps at first but the end user is also free to setup a server that provides the missing functionality and support that the network needs. It also supports some of the highest security available in terms of connecting the client to the server and protecting your balances overall. It is a very flexible tool that is easy to setup and use and you can get going right away immediately after install.': 1, 'nice explanation, have 1 mbtc /u/changetip': 0, "Thanks, I appreciate it, and thanks for the coin, much appreciated!

The colored coins just become tokens tagged to particular serial-numbered certificates.  You can then trade the colored coins or fractions thereof instead of the actual certificates, and they can stay in the vault.\n\nMost, but not all, stock certificates these days stay in the vaults of the Depository Trust Corporation, which was set up specifically to ease trading.

The record isn\'t updated until the 3rd day, so it is always 3 days behind trades being made currently.\n\nThe particular market that NASDAQ is applying the blockchain to is pre-IPO start-up shares.  Those shares are not publicly traded yet, so it is even slower than the main markets.  The share owner records are maintained by an attorney or the corporate secretary, by paper or a spreadsheet.
