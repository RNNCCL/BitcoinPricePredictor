This is a service that you pay for. It applies to all of your credit card transactions when in fact you probably would only ever consider using it for only a fraction of those.\n\nWith Bitcoin, you can achieve the same effect by using an independent arbitrator instead of a middle man. This arbitrator would only have the power to either send the funds to the party you are transacting with, or back to you. \n\nBitcoin transactions are programmable. You can incorporate tiny scripts in them that determine what will happen and (since recently) when. How this works:\n\nYou create a payment script that will only validate to true if:\n\n- 1 month has passed, at which point the payment can be claimed by the party you are transacting with (if he is the receiver that is).\n\nor:\n\n- 2 of a total of 3 signatures is presented. One produced by you, one produced by the other party, and one produced by the arbitrator.\n\nThese are the resolution paths:\n\n- If you receive your product, you and the other party can both sign a transaction that sends the funds immediately to the receiver. \n\n- If you didn\'t receive your product, you appeal to the arbitrator and after providing sufficient information, you and the arbitrator can decide to send the funds back to you.\n\n- If you are making a false claim, the other party and the arbitrator can decide to move the funds to the receiver immediately.\n\n- If the arbitrator disappears, you and the receiver can decide to either send the payment directly to the receiver, back to you, or start again with a new arbitrator.\n\n- In the event of no action by any party, the funds automatically go to the receiver. \n\n\nThe advantages are as follows:\n\n- You can choose whether or not you want to use an arbitrator for every transaction you send. \n\n- You and the party you are transacting with can choose which arbitrator to use.\n\n- As a result, there will be competition between arbitrators, which will likely result in lower fees. \n\n- Since there is no arbitrator lock-in (you can pick whichever on you and the other party agree on), they have their reputation on the line. Unfavourable reviews of arbitrators will result in loss of income for them.\n\n- Arbitrators can\'t run off with your money. It always requires either you or the receiver to sign the spending transaction.\n\n\n\nHaving said all that, you might ask yourself "That looks like a fantastic idea!

Introducing a fee market is something we have never had before, and as such is very risky without proper testing and analysis, which was not done.

Most people assume one of the coins will disappear because it will not have enough miners supporting it. However some core developers are already worried about too much miner centralization and considering to change the PoW. Candidate code is already written: https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/41aocn/httpsbitcoinorgenbitcoincorecapacityincreases_why/cz0z9ym. Coins that you buy before the fork will be valid on both chains. This will only work when both forks survive but the probability of that is not zero anymore': 2, 'You are correct and it doesnt double your coins. If Bitcoin forks it splits in two coins e.g. BitcoinCore and let me call it ClassicCoin as it is debatable which coin you could calll Bitcoin. The fork will only happen if 75% of the miners say they will support ClassicCoin. Now most people think that if this fork is successful the remaining 25% of the miners will also support ClassicCoin and BitcoinCore will have not much hashpower protecting the network and therefore die. However there is a possibility that the 25% of miners supporting BitcoinCore dont switch and that both chains can continue. 25% of the hashpower is still much more than most other altcoins. See overview here: http://www.coinwarz.com/cryptocurrency?sort=diff&dir=desc. However it might be theoretically possible i believe its a highly unlikely and also undesirable scenario.

Mining does not power the network, it is a competition for who can add to the transaction history.

Miners sync the blockchain with the rest of the network, it's a big file but it can only grow by a max of about 144mb per day. It's about 60gb now.

Henceforth I shall call it the Degracchi scale and refer to it everywhere I can.\n\nOk hold on a minute. You are definitely not a 3 with questions like those. Those are deep questions for a newbie.\n\n> Are fees really a side issue for 1M devs in the sense that they are more concerned with centralization (or some other issue relating to the scaling debate), and see growing fees as a negative but comparatively better characteristic than their perceived threat of centralization? \n\n\nI believe this is true. \n\nFees will rise over time to compensate miners for a falling subsidy. Right now they are rising because space on the chain is scarce. It\'s demand and supply basically. Still quite cheap to send coins so I don\'t see what the problem is.\n\nTo answer your other questions fees do prevent blockchain spam which causes bloat. Remember the chain is replicated on thousands of computers worldwide and spam transactions waste space on all those nodes.\n\n>Do Core devs supporting 1M blocks want most transactions to move off-chain, resulting in capacity headroom on-chain and thus low fees with 1M/small blocks?\n\nSeems to be the idea. They do intend to raise the blocksize in the near future. They just haven\'t decided on it yet.': 1, "Thanks for posting. I'm not a core dev but I observe the development process so have some knowledge.\n\n> Do Core devs supporting 1M blocks want to cull low-value transactions from the blockchain? If so, why?\n\nThey believe a large number of transactions on the blockchain would damage decentralization. The end result of rationing the space on the blockchain would probably mean people would only be willing to pay for high-value transactions to be included. Unless there's not enough demand to fill the blocks like today, in which case low-fee transactions would be mined just fine.\n\n>Is the aim to have a fee market develop more about funding mining as the block reward diminishes?\n\nYes.\n\nProof-of-work is expensive. At equilibrium and assuming no fees, 25btc*exchange_rate dollars of energy must be burned every 10 minutes on average. At today's prices is nearly $10,000 per 10 minutes, or $1.4m per day. Obviously this number will drop as the reward halves in a few months time, and again every 4 years, but if it drops too low then bitcoin will be vulnerable to attack.\n\nAnd all that mining is pointless in the same way the military is pointless. The only point it has is to protect against other miners. If everybody could just agree to trust each other we could do without mining or money. But that will never happen, in the same way that nations will never voluntarily disarm themselves.\n\n> Do Core devs supporting 1M blocks want most transactions to move off-chain, resulting in capacity headroom on-chain and thus low fees with 1M/small blocks?\n\nI believe that's the plan yes.\n\n> If the issue mainly relates to funding miners, are 1M devs of the view that it is not possible to fit enough tx on-chain to fund miners with low fees per tx without centralization (ie 8GB blocks), and thus the system needs to adapt to have miners funded by a smaller number of higher value, higher fee on-chain transactions?\n\nYes that sounds correct. The blockchain transactions will likely each represent hundreds or thousands of real economic transactions.\n\n> What has Satoshi said about funding miners once new bitcoin issuance reaches zero?\n\nSatoshi supported what we would call a fee market. From the whitepaper:\n\nhttps://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf\n\n*Once a predetermined number of coins have entered circulation, the incentive can transition entirely to transaction fees and be completely inflation free*\n\nNote that this was in 2009. Bitcoin is vastly better understood today than it was in 2009, or even in 2011. Satoshi may have created bitcoin but it's wrong to hold him as some kind of deity who wrote the holy scripture.\n\n> Are fees really a side issue for 1M devs in the sense that they are more concerned with centralization (or some other issue relating to the scaling debate), and see growing fees as a negative but comparatively better characteristic than their perceived threat of centralization?\n\nAbsolutely. Without decentralization bitcoin is worthless. The high-fees are unfortunate but we can have our cake and eat it too by using off-chain transactions like hash-locked bidirectional payment channel (aka lightning), which retains all the decentralization properties of bitcoin while being far more efficient.\n\n> Is there any consensus among Core devs on fees?\n\nAll developers see a low-fee high-block-size bitcoin as centralized and worthless. Some developers don't actually believe a fee market can provide long term miner security, although no replacement is known except by modifying the inflation rate. All developers see value in solutions like lightning and probably expect the majority of small transactions to be conducted there.\n\nA great blog post to read about fees and incentives is this one: https://medium.com/@SatoshiLite/eating-the-bitcoin-cake-fc2b4ebfb85e#.lhssl5jua\n\nIt describes the problem we face today that is convincing users to accept higher fees in order to fund network security.": 3, 'Bitcoin is not a general database and should not be.
