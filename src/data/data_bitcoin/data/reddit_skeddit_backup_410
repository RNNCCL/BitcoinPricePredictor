Designer brand purses cost hundreds of dollars but are made out of the same material as any other decent purse. It\'s quite clear you\'re paying for the designer name on the bag. The business knows people will pay good money for that, and so they charge hundreds of dollars for it. So tell me, if I know people will pay for premium HBO why am I not allowed to sell my product that way? **Why aren\'t you outraged at designer handbag manufacturers?**\n\nLouis Vuitton could sell their purses for $20, but that wouldn\'t be a smart business decision. HBO could sell Game of Thrones for a small fee, but that\'s not a very good business decision. **And for some reason, society thinks sellers of digital goods aren\'t allowed to make good business decisions. Why?** HBO *could* sell their show on Bittorrent for a fee, but to make the same amount of money they are making with the premium cable channels, that fee would probably be unreasonably high in the eyes of pirating-inclined consumers, and you (or 99% of people) would still pirate it because <insert new flawed reason here>.\n\nPirating content just shows that you really want to experience their content, but would never have paid for it anyway. There\'s no point in attempting to cater to you, because you\'ll probably just move the goalposts and continue to pirate it for free. You show no respect for capitalism when you pirate, and the only thing to do is enforce copyright law or forget about you and focus on those willing to be paying customers.\n\n*The correct way to show dissatisfaction with service models* is to boycott their products. Don\'t buy them, don\'t pirate them, don\'t use them in any way. You can air your grievances and explain why you won\'t buy their product and what it would take to make you buy it. The business may or may not decide to cater to you to get your money, but you\'re just going to have to deal with their decision.\n\nI find it hard to take anyone seriously who complains about movie and music distribution while pirating movies and music. You clearly have no respect for the economic system of distributing movies and music (and all goods) in the first place. You support capitalism when it suits you, but then suddenly advocate some socialist entitlement to everything when things don\'t go your way. It boggles the mind. I read a Reddit post about a guy who hated EA (pretty typical) and refused to play any of their games. He wouldn\'t look at them or interact with them in any way. His kids knew not to ask for EA games in the store.

Most of the people I know subscribe to one or more of these services (and maybe even I do too - even though you have me pinned as a pirate). \n\nSome people pirate so much shit that they would never be able to afford it in the first place, if they had to buy a physical copy of the album on CD or a movie on a DVD/Bluray. So if they had to do it physically and legally, they would have to settle for less content. Digital distribution platforms like Steam, Spotify and Netflix have been changing this, so that now for the first time we can do it digitally and legally, and because it is cheaper, we still get as much content as we can consume, within our budget. And more and more people are subscribing. \n\n> So tell me, if I know people will pay for premium HBO why am I not allowed to sell my product that way? \n\nYou are allowed to sell it any way you like, but the fact is simply that more and more people have been choosing to subscribe to emerging distribution platforms like Steam, Spotify and Netflix - and as a consequence, artists are choosing to distribute their stuff on these platforms. I presume because it generates more money for them. \n\n**Now on to Bittorrent:**\n\nA distributed distribution platform based on Bittorrent is simply the next step. It will completely outmatch Steam, Spotify and Netflix, because it eliminates the middle man. Steam, Spotify or Netflix will no longer take their cut, because the artist can use Bittorrent directly. The only cut the artist has to live with is insignificant fees for bandwidth paid to the seeders by the leechers. \n\n> Why wouldn't people just continue to pirate it for free?

More generally, complementarities between growth and income equality objectives suggest that policies aimed at raising average living standards can also influence the distribution of income and ensure a more inclusive prosperity."\n\n"Disparities in financial services access. There are large disparities in the use of financial services between advanced economies and EMDCs and across income levels within a country. More than 80 percent of adults in advanced economies have an account at a formal financial institution\xe2\x80\x94twice more than in EMDCs. Within EMDCs, the share of adults with an account or a loan at a formal financial institution is largely skewed toward the top income earners. The rest rely on their own limited savings to invest in education or become entrepreneurs, suggesting that financial inequality and income inequality go hand in hand. In many EMDCs, low-income households and small-scale firms often face challenges in accessing financial services due to lack of financial knowledge, complicated processes, onerous paperwork, and other market failures. Moreover, available financial products tend to be more limited and relatively costly."\n\n" Financial deepening can provide households and firms with greater access to resources to meet their financial needs, such as saving for retirement, investing in education, capitalizing on business opportunities, and confronting shocks. Financial deepening accompanied by more inclusive financial systems can thus lower income inequality, while improving the allocation of resources (Dabla-Norris and others 2015). Theory, however, suggests that financial development could benefit the rich in the early stages of development, but the benefits become more broadly shared as economies develop (Greenwood and Jovanovic 1990). Indeed, some studies have found that financial development, measured as the relative share of the banking and stock market sectors in the economy, boosts top incomes the most in the early stages of development (Roine, Vlachos, and Waldenstr\xc3\xb6m 2009). Moreover, inequality can increase as those with higher incomes and assets have a disproportionately larger share of access to finance, serving to further increase the skill premium, and potentially the return to capital (Claessens and Perotti 2007).

So even if 80% of miners move to XT and this triggers XT's hardfork, the majority of Bitcoin users can still be affected.\n\nI hope that the big-block version (XT or modified QT) will enable blocks > 1MB *immediately* after detecting that 80% of the miners are running it.  That will ensure that the fork happens when 20% of the miners are still running the old version.  For better effect, the threshold should be 51% rather than 80%.  \n\nSomeone suggested that the big-block version should wait some time (say, 3 months) after that threshold is achieved, before actually allowing bigger blocks.  But this precaution would spoil the fun, since it would give time for the slow players still running the old version (the 20% miners, and any nodes and clients) to upgrade to the big-block version.  Fortunately it seems that this suggestion is being ignored by all parties concerned.\n\n> After the hardfork in XT is actually triggered and the block chain forks, there will be three types of transactions:\n\nThat's if the transactions are not programmed to become incompatible after the fork.  Keeping the transactions compatible, as everybody seems to assume, maximizes the risk of chaos and perhaps irreversible loss of coins, and allows users and nodes to run the old version of the client software for months after the fork deadline.\n\nIt has been suggested that the big-block version should change the transaction format or signing algorithm after the fork deadline, so that new transactions issued by it will be accepted as valid only by nodes and miners running the big-block version of software, and are rejected by the small-block; and vice-versa.  But that would be terrible, because clients running the majority version of the  software will not notice anything, while clients who are still running the minority version will notice that their coins are not moving, will promptly upgrade, and find all their coins where they were before the fork.  This would be nowhere as fun to watch as the chaos resulting from having both chains trying to process every transaction request.

They just can't *raise* it above the hard limit, but they can lower it.": 5, 'The difference start to happen when there are more transactions than the smaller block chain can store.\nthe fees on the larger will be smaller, and the transaction will be processed in time. \nThe other will have larger fees and the transactions will be processed slowly and not all of them will be.\n\nGuess what side will win in the (not so) long run?': 1, "> If 75% of hashing power is producing up-version blocks\n\nI don't think you can rely on things like that.\n\nA few miners could decide independently to signal up-version blocks while not accepting blocks bigger than 1MB, causing < 75% XT miners to start mining bigger blocks with maybe say just 40% hashing power - something bad for both Bitcoin and the new alt. \n\nViceversa, someone suggested some miners may think it's a good idea to signaling current block version while using XT. \n\nAs a defensive measure against contentious hard fork some Bitcoin core nodes operators may decide to detect XT (trivial because of getutxo) and make sure it keeps the connection alive while feeding it nothing, no transaction nor blocks, effectively increasing propagation latency and even isolating XT nodes.\n\nReleasing a contentious hard fork can only end badly for everyone in the space.\n\n ": 0, 'If any miner finds (or even merely *believes* he has found) a reason to create maximally sized blocks, then he will do exactly this, filling blocks with garbage transaction data to the maximum allowable size. Your argument only holds so long as miners believe it is against their interests to produce large blocks.': 1, 'Bitcoin isn\'t a democracy. A full node will follow its rules no matter what. So if you\'re using Bitcoin Core, you will *completely reject* any block chain that contains a block larger than 1 MB, even if *everyone else on Earth* is using XT. So even if 80% of miners move to XT and this triggers XT\'s hardfork, the majority of *Bitcoin users* can still be affected.\n\nAfter the hardfork in XT is actually triggered and the block chain forks, there will be three types of transactions:\n\n1. Transactions spending only pre-fork coins. These will be confirmed on both networks and the resulting coins will remain pre-fork coins.\n2. Transactions spending *any* xt-coins. These will be confirmed only on the XT network, and the outputs will become xt-coins. The pre-fork inputs remain unspent on the Bitcoin network.\n3. Transactions spending *any* post-fork BTC. These will be confirmed only on the Bitcoin network, and the outputs will become post-fork BTC. The pre-fork inputs remain unspent on the XT network.\n\n(Post-fork BTC and xt-coins come into existence by mining on their respective chains.)\n\nNeither Bitcoin Core nor Bitcoin XT will pay any attention to these differences, and will by default select inputs at random.\n\nIf someone using XT wants to deposit to an exchange, the exchange must either be using XT or the user must send only pre-fork BTC. If the exchange is on the Bitcoin network and the XT user sends pre-fork BTC, then when the user goes to withdraw, the withdrawal will probably fail because the EWallet will probably use some post-fork BTC as an input; the user will need to start using Bitcoin again to access the money. If it doesn\'t fail, then the user has the same number of pre-fork BTC. If the exchange is on the XT network, then when the user goes to withdraw he will usually get all xt-coins, since the only case in which he would get any pre-fork BTC is if *all* inputs are pre-fork BTC, which is probably unlikely. As a result, the XT user will usually unknowingly trade pre-fork BTC for xt-coins. This is the same but reversed for Bitcoin network users/exchanges.\n\nThe same thing happens in more normal trades, though in two steps (sell+buy) and over a longer period of time.\n\nIf you\'re careful, you can spend pre-fork BTC on both networks. This is terrible for fungibility (an essential property of any money): if the XT fork becomes at all popular, we\'ll have traders pricing things as "1 pre-fork BTC or 1.1 post-fork BTC or 20 xt-coins", which is annoying and not how the software is set up to work. It will also severely exacerbate the above problem because smart traders and exchanges will try to keep pre-fork BTC when possible. If an XT user deposits a mixture of xt-coins and pre-fork BTC to an exchange, the smart exchange will intentionally avoid sending him any pre-fork BTC back when he withdraws.\n\nSo if you use XT after the hardfork is triggered, any money you receive will almost certainly be xt-coins, not pre-fork BTC. Any money you send has a chance of actually depriving you of pre-fork BTC equal to the value sent (the probability is something *very* roughly like <amount of pre-fork BTC in wallet>/<total money in wallet>) and a chance of basically converting the pre-fork BTC inputs to inconvenient-to-access post-fork BTC (they\'ll be in your XT wallet, but you\'ll have to extract the keys and transfer them to Bitcoin wallet software). So a few months after the hardfork is triggered, I\'d expect most XT users to have lost at least 5-10% of their bitcoins, with most of the rest not accessible through the XT software. The exact amount of loss depends on how the XT user transacts, how the BTC in his wallet is distributed, etc. -- if he does no transactions then he\'s not going to lose anything, while if he deposits his whole wallet into an XT exchange and then withdraws it later, he\'ll probably lose 100% of his bitcoins.': 8, 'By "longest chain," what /u/lukerayes08 really meant was "chain whose proof of work has the greatest cumulative difficulty."

I'm coding a hard-fork that will only fork:\n\n+ After March 1, 2016\n+ If 75% of hashing power is producing up-version blocks\n+ AND after some brave miner decides to actually produce a >1MB block.\n\nIt will be very difficult for *anybody* to lose money. Even if we assume that some stubborn minority of miners decides not to upgrade (in spite of Bitcoin Core warning them first that the chain consists mostly of blocks with up-version version number, and then warning them that there is an alternative invalid higher-work chain), those miners will be the only people who will lose money. Ordinary, SVP-using users will follow the longest chain, and since at least 75% of hashing power will be on the bigger-block chain, there is no chance of them losing money. The big-block-rejecting-chain will very, very quickly be left behind and ignored.\n\nThere will NOT be two active chains, that is just FUD.

Ignoring that,\n\n75% hash power most certainly does not result in "no chance" of losing money: considerable chance of loss exists even with the protective conditions you\'ve laid out here (which I have not seen documented elsewhere). And this kind of careless analysis and bold statements of risklessless are part of what has the rest of the technical community so concerned right now.\n\nAnyone enforcing the original rules of the system will continue to do so, and will see three or six or whatever confirmation (though potentially after a delay) and believe their transaction irreversible even when it is double spent on the other chain (or spends coins that never even existed there). This also happily applies to SPV users-- and not just full node users (though nice attempt at making an argument against running a full node... :( )--, as they are still potentially protected by the rule enforcement of the nodes they are behind. So even the SPV centralized trust of hashpower does still not allow trivially bypassing the issue.\n\nEven users who have applied these changes will be subject to loss risk at least when the first >1MB block is produced and the chain is rejected by 75% hashpower. It may take several tries for the actual hashpower majority to decisively overtake ([e.g. 25% hashpower gets 3 ahead with about 20% success rate](https://people.xiph.org/~greg/attack_success.html)).\n\nA 75% hashpower threshold guarantees there will be competing chains, how long they\'ll last is less clear while they exist ample opportunity for theft exists; to see you state otherwise is just astonishing to me.   To avoid these risks even for soft-forks which of already not is standard changes we already don\'t enforce to much higher criteria, even though in that case its likely that no divergence will ever begin at all, simply because the risk created if one did happen to form.\n\nIf the above is what you are telling businesses, you have factually mislead them.': 21, 'I disagree.

But the nxt-chain (no-xt-chain) would not, because of the blocksize limit. This would imply some pre-fork bitcoin transactions would only show up in the xt-chain. Then people with pre-fork bitcoin would prefer to move to the xt-chain because their transactions would need a smaller fee and would have a chance to actually be recorded int he blockchain.\n\nGiven the market of fees, the nxt would require larger fees (a lot larger to be included in any block) and the xt would require smaller fees (just to prevent spamming attack or be included in the next block).\n\nIf the market give a different value to pre-fork bitcoins and post fork bitcoins in the xt and nxt chains, the cost of the fee in both chain must be included in the evaluation, not just if the bitcoin was mined before or after the fork and in what chain.': 1, "Why aren't you setting the mining threshold to 95% like every other soft fork?

It drives the current blog size increase proponents (which there are A LOT of) to go away from bitcoin.org to 3rd party sites (which might become the future true bitcoin websites) to get information from. You say you dont want to harm bitcoin, but what this does is in my view the absolute opposite.': 19, 'I think you are right.': 2, '> What makes a hard fork **non**-contentious?\n\nI consider a hard fork to be non-contentious if it is supported by the vast majority of Bitcoin experts, users, and companies (ie. none of those groups contain any serious opposition). This isn\'t going to happen in the short term for any max block size increase, but this will change as there\'s more debate and research, and as block space actually becomes more scarce. If transactions actually become massively slow or expensive, a more conservative increase to ~2 MB would be easy to get consensus for. And other hard forks might be easier than the max block size increase if any are necessary (I don\'t know of any big proposals).\n\n"Non-contentious" is subjective. We\'ll all have to individually decide whether a fork is contentious or not. But I think it\'s pretty clear that there is very significant contention surrounding all max block size proposals.\n\nI talked about this a little more in the pull request:  \nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin.org/pull/894#issuecomment-112213400': 1, 'Yeah, a "fork" where everyone goes the same way, isn\'t a fork.

But it's also possible for them to attempt to replace the tip of the block chain for (usually) the same amount of proof of work.\n\nWhy would they do that?  Because when the block subsidy (currently 25 BTC) becomes too small, miners will be competing for transaction fees---and if there aren't enough queued transactions for the next block, it could be more profitable to replace the previous block to get its transaction fees.\n\nThat may not sound like a problem---after all, the proof of work is usually the same.  However, when replacing a block, the miner can optionally kick out some transactions (decreasing their confirmation score).  Worse, if this block replacement happens too often, it would lead to a significant reduction in the total amount of proof of work protecting the block chain.\n\nThe solution is to try to ensure there's always a queue of fee-paying transactions.": 0, "The developers don't get to decide what software people run..": 6, "Forking the blockchain is necessary because the core devs think it's not yet necessary?

That fellow is highly intelligent! (And, yes, I still value his contributions)\n\nIs this egos? Is this Blockstream? What the heck is this?\n\nWell, pointless to rant to you, you know what I am talking about.

Both of these scenarios are referred to as "Catastrophic consensus failure".\n\nSo, think of the hardfork as being a new coin with an initial distribution (premine) of ~15M coins (if the hardfork happens next year).  So anyone with Bitcoin (BTC) UTXOs at the point of the hardfork also have the same UTXOs on the new chain -- whose coins we might use a different code BTX since they are mined by Bitcoin-XT.\n\nNow what most are hoping happens is that any remaining miners on the original chain see that the hardfork has "consensus" and they stop mining the original chain, the hardfork side gets all the value and traction that bitcoin had and Bitcoin continues unabated.\n\nBut if instead the 20% or so miners on the original chain stay (or see additional hashing power return) then there is the situation were there are two persistent chains.    This will, at a very minimum, be very, very messy if it happens. \n\nFrom that outcome we would likely have the situation where BTCs trade at one price, and BTXs trade at another.  So if we have $230 / bitcoin today, we might have $40 for the BTCs and $120 for the BTXx.
