I knew there had to be a real-world example of a proposed hardfork that was contested.  In that example, the two sides continued to persist -- just as I suspect will happen with a Bitcoin hardfork.\n\nThe problem is that most are thinking "the chain with the greatest work wins", and that\'s that.    But that\'s not completely true.  For a specific protocol "the chain with the greatest work wins", that\'s true.  But we have two protocols.  And thus the potential to have to chains, persist after the hardfork.\n\nI\'m not sure the reason why more people aren\'t thinking about this potential outcome.  One reason could be that we would like things to remain clean and simple. With a universally accepted hardfork things are clean and simple. \n\nWith another Elacoin, things stop being clean and simple.   If there were more exchanges interested in Elacoin that would have been a more applicable example.   If one exchange accepted the Elacoin coins mined with the changed protocol, and Cryptsy kept accepting Elacoin without the changes, then you\'ld have a widely diverging price between the two sides. \n\nIf we simply assume that could also happen with the Bitcoin hardfork as well, a better solution might emerge.\n\nPerhaps the best way to approach this is to treat the hardfork as if it is a new coin (which technically, it is).  This new coin has an initial distribution (premine) where there is a UTXO for each Bitcoin UTXO that existed at the time the hardfork begins.   Think of it that way, and it gets less complicated.     Have some bitcoins today?   Great, now you also have some units of this new coin that also has a larger blocksize limit (e.g., 20MB).  Some merchants might use Core v0.11 and accept only this new coin, some might use pre-v0.11 and accept only Bitcoins.  Some might accept both Bitcoin and this new coin, as well as Litecoin and other alts as well. \n\nThere\'s no big deal with this hardfork if you think of it this way.': 2, 'The author overlooks the arguments of the core devs that oppose the 20MB raise, as well as the innovations in the pipeline (LN, sidechains, ...) that will enable scaling.

It is vulnerable to very simple attack by replacing you the target address and the amount of BTC to send and you will not know that, this way you have to include display on the secured side.\nBottom line, I don't see way to use it at all, maybe I am wrong and I will love to here from you about the advantage of it (Please be explicitly logical and challenge my issues)\nWay to use it and not to use mycelium or cloud wallet\n\nP.S\nPlease read this:\nhttp://www.eliptibox.com/#!Security-AND-Usability/cw4e/5509708f0cf292acc4a7dc21\n\nIt contain our review of the current solutions.\n\nPrice:\nFor our first release, EliptiBox really going to be expansive, for perfect devices you have to pay more and If you like to have the most secured and miniature vault on the planet that will be with you and will connect wirelessly to your smartphone you have to pay for that.\nAnyway, we are here to stay and we are running for very long distance, in the future, when bitcoin will be more common, we will sell this device for price that lower than the L/W price today.\nIt is possible to do it for mass production.\ncurrently, we have different target, we are working on creating an open source platform for the bitcoin community to take it and to participate in the challenging of the device till it will be the perfect bitcoin wallet.\n\nMulti-signature\nBe sure that it is going to be one of our early features.\nWe understand the value of this and we will support it.\n\nEliptiBox - Complex HW ?\nI agree that EliptiBox is not a simple MCU with USB that placed on PCB, as I said, I don't see how this can be secured wallet for bitcoin.\nbut, It is much more simple than you think.\nactually to is so simple and so elegant design that we are sure that everyone with basic knowledge in programming will be able to develop mo that and to understand it very easily after we will publish our documentation with the block diagram and code description and API description for the drivers.\nBelive me, it is much simple than you think, we worked very hard to do it like that because we totally know that simplicity is mandatory for getting security.\nWe have to provide the community to challenging that very easily so it will be highly secured in small amount of time.\n\nCooperation with L/W\ndon't see any value with that, Maybe cooperation with Mycelium is smarter advise\n\nEliptiBox name\nwe are very sorry that you are not like the name, but if this is your main problem, we are more than ok with that.\nactually we are in love with this name as we are in love with our product :)\nso in love that we will be satisfy if we will not sell even on device but we will have it work for us :), believe me, that is the true.\n\nElipti is from Elliptic curve and box is just box because it sounds cool.\n\nAgain, thanks for your comments, I hope to get a lot of that kind of comments so we will know that the community are interesting in our device.\n\nBest Regards,\nEliptiBox team \n": 1, 'Already scoured your site before asking. You\'re a fool to think EliptiBox replaces something as simple as a Ledger Wallet (L/W).\n\nI see them as **two different tools for two different jobs**. The complex h/w wallets will replace the role of banks, and simple devices like L/W will handle walking around money. Also, because EliptiBox will be relatively expensive, it will mean you must store all your bitcoin in one location, but **commodity priced h/w like L/W allows for multi-key solutions** and spreading risk to multiple devices.\n\nThe L/W could certainly benefit from a secure device like EliptiBox, acting as a secure programmer. The major drawback of L/W is the need to setup the device on a secure computer (clean room). EliptiBox has the facilities to fulfill the role of bank, e.g. account management, whereas commodity hardware like L/W fulfills the role of a small account, or traditional wallet with walking around money. **To put it succinctly, I\'m not going to buy my kids an EliptiBox so they can dispense their lunch money.**\n\n**EliptiBox has all of the components necessary to fulfill the role of a clean room.** To put it another way, if L/W didn\'t exist today, it would have eventually been a great natural add-on for EliptiBox. EliptiBox should be sold as a "secure clean room used to program your security tokens". In fact, if I were you folks, I would be signing a pact with L/W right now!\n\nAlso, in my opinion, I hate the name EliptiBox. It says nothing to me about security. It\'s hard to type. The "box" part degrades the value, e.g. my cat uses a box. Don\'t get me wrong, I love your product idea, and there will be a niche for it.

I have in fact argued this point when people pull out the long conf times and say it won\'t work for standard retail. If you look at my post, I said "ship". What I "ship" is not physical is digital.\n \nI am cofounder of a site that sells colored coins/open assets. Most of the assets we sell are income generating, IE, they pay dividends. Because of this, and because there is no way to reclaim them once they have been issued, we have decided to only process the orders and issue the assets when the txs have a confirmation or 2.

Parent claimed that 2 was not much worse than the ~100GB needed to run an Electrum server, and not likely to be exacerbated by use of Ethereum contracts because VerSum stores authenticated outputs of computations, not full computations at every stage. Parent made a complex technical response to 3 with two main arguments: that all honest nodes have to be knocked out of action to make a DOS effective against clients, and that in the unlikely event that this occurs without detection, dishonest VerSum servers can only mislead clients in limited ways not likely to lead to significant loss of income.*\n\nUnless you\'re talking about the ancient history of Electrum your 1. is not applicable, because the client still requires an SPV. You can DOS a lot of things (including Bitcoin nodes), point is that this should not be a catastrophic event. That is what an SPV protects you from. As to blockchain explorers, well...\n\nRe 2. storage space, that is fair. Time-space tradeoff, very good (on second reading, VerSum caches computations at ~~transaction boundaries~~ some level of detail, subject to developer tweaking). Nevertheless, it is far from free either in time or space to initialise a new server, which is important in the following.\n\n"The odds of one honest server existing" is not the correct security metric. I can run one server behind 1000 proxies and run a Sybil attack - each client has a limited number of connections, so will have high probability of just connecting to me. If not, a DOS will just look like a couple of servers dropping offline. This is not unusual.\n\nIf I successfully capture a client\'s connections, it\'s as if I have a time machine. I can\'t sign transactions on anyone else\'s behalf, but I can sign or not sign transactions of my own, and I can remove others\' transactions as if they never happened. One attack here is buying Bitcoin with XCP that doesn\'t live at the address the client thinks it does. I (really) own some XCP at an address A. Then I (really) transfer it to address B. Now I lie to the client by proving the existence of XCP at A, but ignoring my transaction from A to B. I also insert a spurious order to buy Bitcoin for XCP. Perhaps I match an order that the client already placed. The client sends a BTCPay (i.e. signs a valid and high-value Bitcoin transaction to A) and is now screwed, because neither my order nor its BTCPay messages are valid in the real Counterparty consensus, but the Bitcoin transaction certainly is in the Bitcoin consensus.': 2, '/r/butthereum': 1, "wat\n\neveryone uses communication on a daily basis, telephone, etc.\n\nmost people don't directly participate in any market on a daily basis, let alone specifically a *prediction market*. augur is literally a niche play, which by definition is not a killer app": 3, "The 'zueira' never ends": 0, 'I\'m not sure the XCP part is really supposed to be used as a currency where greater volume on exchanges = greater success. Even price is more or less irrelevant to anyone but speculators as the main purpose of XCP is anti-spam, and automatically escrowable token -- the asset registration fee could be automatically bumped and an alternate token is able to be used in lieu of xcp. \n\nAs far as the protocol in it\'s current form dictates you don\'t need to bother with XCP at all, you can just use Bitcoin. (which is mainly what I\'m doing - using a bit of bitcoin dust to register free numerical assets for testing!) I think these extensions have possibility to add great utility to the blockchain and therefore increase the ultimate valuation of bitcoin- the token required to ride the blockchain\n\nMeasuring the total amount of daily XCP transactions on the bitcoin network each day / total amount of daily bitcoin transactions it seems to average out about 2%.  http://blockscan.com/charts_transaction_counterparty_btc. \n\nSo one in every 50 bitcoin transaction is actually also a counterparty transaction.
