People naturally gravitate toward negative information, it's an evolutionary trait to be on the lookout for danger and respond to it, even if disproportionately.  Moreover, while there are many drawbacks to deregulation, it does have certain advantages.  The banks really did screw a lot of people over in the last (and in some places, still-ongoing) crisis, and many had an unreasonable expectation of safety due to the checks and balances in place, which largely failed.  I have practically no expectation of safety when it comes to bitcoin - I'm reasonably confident that the core and electrum wallets are solid, and the protocol not subject to exploitation, and that's about it.\n\nIf only a few clueless people see this negative press, they will be better off, and the community will, as a result, be stronger as a whole.

At the time of decreasing profits in BTC and Alts, Multipools were not doing so well - then Hashlets came out from GAW, and promised to change everything. Initially there profits were 3 or 4 times the other multipools (like Wafflepool etc) - so there was huge demand for these insanely profitable mining pools. Except...\nThey were "cloud-mining" and you weren\'t buying a cloud-miner - but instead some sort of "virtual" miner that "didn\'t use electric" (as read their very opaquely worded terms of service - that have since been re-worded subtley).\n\nWith their hashlets (solo/prime/genesis or whatever they call them) you could mine "SHA" and "Scrypt" (and maybe X11 coins but I can\'t recall) - and the "multipool" automatically traded it for bitcoin payouts.\nSince then and until now - they have not provided a single shred of evidence of any blocks found on any blockchain - considering their supposed hashrates and userbase (the userbase is probably real, the hashrates that they would have generated however would have been more than the total hashrate of most scrypt coins) - especially given conversion rates and the massive amount of dumping that would have had to have gone on if they were really multipool mining.\n\nSo all this leads to a blackbox - where people just pay GAW in USD (or BTC I think) for a "hashlet" - and they get back BTC every few days as payout or whatever. They get access to their dashboard and their "hashlet" stats showing its hashrate and all nice statistics (albeit without any actual real information such as coins/blocks found etc).\n\nYou can also buy/sell these hashlets on their own marketplace that they operate.\n\nAfter a while, GAW decided to offer "Hashpoints" for these hashlets, so instead of receiving actual bitcoin or usd, you received these "hashpoints" with the promise that they were going to bring out a "bitcoin beating, amazon endorsed crypto-currency for the new age" - where (and this is a fundamental part of why paycoin is a big issue) - they would honour a $20 per paycoin exchange via their new system "Paybase" - as well as Amazon/Walmart integrate etc.\n\nThis essentially lead to them being able to take peoples BTC or USD, give them back a worthless "Hashpoint" (in that it had no value outside of their own systems that they had made) - and then convert these months later to Paycoins.. which again had no value other than speculation of their $20 claim.\n\nIts quite an ingenious scam IMO - especially if they were never mining (its also potentially a total Ponzi if it turns out that they were just giving people their own money back) - but maybe they traded it/invested it, maybe even ponzied their own investors to get the consumer\'s money back - Then created a new coin with speculation in order to regain the actual money that was never there in the first place...': 41, "New HT post.. some good links. \n\nShapeShift.io Drops Paycoin, says, \xe2\x80\x9chigh threshold of evidence as fraud\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nEvidence:\n\nGarza promising to buy Paycoin at $20 per (archived since it's been deleted) https://archive.today/W3OTH\n\nGarza again promising a $20 price (archived since it's been deleted) https://i.imgur.com/OVQdmym.png\n\nGarza Tweeting a $20 price guarantee http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:8uqr_DdF00oJ:https://twitter.com/gawceo/status/546944991747403776+&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us\n\nGarza's justification post on Hashtalk after the promise was renegged https://hashtalk.org/topic/26931/xpy-price-floor": 2, "Someone's jealous of success.

And so on and on and on.\n\nBitcoin may not have made significant inroads in commerce yet, but it did revolutionize scamming.': 0, "There are three aspects I'd bring up in response:\n\nFirst, raw Bitcoin is not *primarily* an everyday consumer technology. The way I often put it is Bitcoin replaces SWIFT not Starbucks points. That doesn't mean it isn't a consumer payments technology at all; indeed I use it regularly for online payments without any trouble, and much prefer it to using insecure credit cards (e.g. I paid for a trip (flight, hotel) with it last week). But in its raw form it's problematic for the everyday person, mainly because of security issues.\n\nSecond, a lot of the criticisms (e.g. Western Union is better) are purely a function of the current situation, and represent a lack of dynamic perspective. Bitcoin was utterly useless for anything in 2009. Last week I booked a flight with it. Western Union is *certainly* not better in a world where Bitcoin is spendable in everyday life; e.g. a Chinese friend of mine paid a debt to me in Bitcoin earlier last year. That was certainly a hell of a lot easier than using Western Union; we just have to assume that for me, it is as good as money, otherwise I will have to exchange it again, incurring fees anyway. The same can be said about arguments with respect to volatility; its volatility is largely driven by it being such a small, illiquid market. If you trace the logic carefully, you should realise that what you're actually saying is: Bitcoin will never be a good money because it's not a good money today. If that's true, how come it became so much better as money over the last 5 years?\n\nThird, it's easy to dismiss the other aspect as 'ideological', but I consider that what you're really talking about is a *lack* of ideology; a neutrality and non-censorability. Bitcoin cannot be printed at will, cannot be faked and cannot be censored. This is not really ideology, it's the fundamental properties of money.": 1, '>  To follow that advice, all you could do with bitcoin is send it to yourself.\n\nObviously not. You can send it to other people. That is the entire point.\n\nThe blockchain allows for cash transfer.\n\nIt is true that creating other elements of a financial system involves creating (or reusing existing) trust systems. But the devil is in the details; there are several ways in which cryptocurrency (and cryptography in general) can enable more trustlessness (or less security holes a la Szabo "trusted third parties = security holes"). Examples: multisig means the escrow agent does not have to be trusted to *not run away with the money independently of the two counterparties*. Proof of reserve means knowing that a bank holds X btc without revealing any other private information. Etc.\n\n> Scammers absolutely love bitcoin. \n\nAbsolutely right. Just as scammers absolutely love cash. Bitcoin, being a more powerful form of cash (instant global transfer) is in some cases even more desirable, although its liquidity being as limited as it is, you\'ll find many scammers who prefer things like moneypaks.': 5, 'I explained above why bitcoin is much, much better than cash (or any other form of payment) for all sorts of criminal activities.\n\nFor legal payments, on the other hand, bitcoin is not significantly better than other forms of payment.  Cash and cards are still more convenient for in-person shopping.  Paypal and bank transfers are more convenient for internet shopping.  Western Union is more convenient for worker remittances to poor countries.  Then there are all the security problems and lack of consumer protection.  It is hard to point to a legal niche where bitcoin is clearly superior to alternatives -- except for ideological reasons.': 1, '"side effect" :/\n\nFTFY': 2, '> There are no "decentralized services" in the cryptocurrency ecosystem except the blockchains themselves\n\nWhen it comes to currency, I think this is true.  Going further, blockchain tech has opened the door for consensus algorithms that were previously thought to be impossible.  All of a sudden there is a whole new field in computer science where studying blockchain tech opens up thinking in how consensus can be reached without a central party.  With this mindset, cryptocurrency is an example of a decentralized service, but not the only one.  Some examples I can think of are Tor, OpenBazaar, Diaspora and the PirateBrowser.  AirBnB and Uber are examples of hybrid models that emphasize the power of p2p and there is very little centralized risk.\n\n> To follow that advice, all you could do with bitcoin is send it to yourself.\n\n....and send it to any other party...!\n\n> Actually, the percentage of scams among bitcoin-related services is MUCH higher than among the general economy. \n\nI disagree.

This system collects no customer information. \nFees are 0% for the first $100,000 and 0.5% thereafter. \n  \n1. Bitpay offers a similar set of services. The main differences are that they offer a bit more customization when it comes to collecting donor information and setting donation limits.  \nTheir donation page [looks like this](https://bitpay.com/139865/donate).  \nThey also make it a bit easier to share your donation campaign on Facebook and Twitter.  \nTheir POS app is mobile based rather than web-based.  \nTheir basic account is free. Fees apply if you want extras like Quickbooks integration.  \n  \n1. QuadrigaCX also has a couple options. The simplest way to use their system is to set up an auto-sell address. The downside is that you only get one address for everyone.  \nThey also have a web-based merchant POS system, it [looks like this](https://www.quadrigacx.com/examples/advanced).  \nFees are set at 1%.  \n\n1.

The first wallet that will be Stroem enabled is MultiBitHD.\n\n* Anybody can start a Stroem hub. There will be a simple OSS impl for ppl to use.

With both ends being equals, you can use a channel in both directions. The weak point as mentioned above is the recipient having to be online not only when receiving money but also to close the channel in a timely manner. For closing the channel, no sensitive Information is required, so it can be delegated to a hub for example. This would allow me to use 1year channels for most my needs most of the time. Symmetry would also allow to pay back a payment if the shop wants to.\n\nHubs should settle their mutual debt and could do that even without channels if they trust each other just like the recipient might trust his hub. Outgoing channels bind resources so there is an incentive for trust over channels.\n\nHubs can steal any money relayed via them. I suppose, the network would quickly learn about corrupt hubs. Users can decrease their risk though by sending only small increments. Sending $1000 $1 at a time would still be faster and cheaper than an on chain transaction but would limit the risk to $1, provided hubs are with some solid reputation (proof of burn based id...).\n\nNow promissory notes is what exactly?

": 5, 'We are trying to solve the problem with micropayment over bitcoin. There are two problems, bitcoin transaction fees and confirmation time. We also achieve increased privacy as a side effect.\n\nThe transaction fees are not a problem now, but we believe that bitcoin will become big with a lot of transactions per second. This implies that the fees will go up. We aggregate many micro payments using payment channels. The effect is that all micro payments share one single transaction fee.\n\nThe confirmation time is also solved by using payment channels. The off chain payment increases are instant and still fully secure.\n\nWhat we do is Stroem, a protocol where micro payments can be routed over a network of hubs, from the consumer to the merchant. It is done by Promissory Notes, i.e. the consumer buys a promissory note from a hub for each micro payment and sends it to the merchant who in turn redeems it for the merchants hub. The merchants hub then redeems the note from the issuing hub. Of course the can be more hubs in between. The reason for using promissory notes is that it enables the merchant and hubs to batch the redeems. This will of course increase the risk but it enables a more efficient handling of small payments.\n\nNow, why do we distinguish between merchants and consumers? In our world merchants sells stuff 24/7, are always online and are public entities. Also merchants and hubs are commercial entities that already works with risks when it comes to payments. The consumers typically have mobile wallets. It is hard to get a mobile phone to provide services without a third party server. For consumer to consumer payments, why not use regular bitcoin transactions?\n\n\nAlso, Stroem is an open protocol, anyone can implement their own wallets/merchants/hubs or what ever. When we\'re ready we will release the specs as well as reference implementations.\n\nWe\'ve been busy implementing all the stuff, and our external web has not been top priority. \n\nRemember we are enabling fast micro payments. You pay a small amount and get serviced in seconds. Stroem should not be used for large payment where waiting a few seconds it not an issue. You are trading bitcoins "no third party needed" for "fast service with a third party needed but I only risk a dollar"\n\n': 12, "Well yes.\n\n1) the Micro payment from consumer to hub on the channel is immediate and secure. No way to double spend.\n\n2) The consumer gets the Promissory Note (basically an IOU signed by the Hub) from the Stroem hub that (s)he signs and sends to the merchant. \n\n3) The merchant validates the signatures in the Note, and can hold the Note until (s)he decides it's time to get paid. \n\n4) When the merchant sends the Note(s) (could be a Batch to increase performance) to the Hub, the Hub will validate the signatures on the Note(s) and pay. \n\nNote: It is impossible to double spend the Note too (explanation is a bit complicated, but just trust me). It is - however - possible for the Hub not to pay the merchant, but this would be stupid, since the Note has his signature, and the amount *should* be too small to steal.\n\nAll in all: no double spends and very fast. Real bitcoin transaction, except for the short span of trust between merchant and hub.": 5, "The channel amount can't be double spent by the payer because the payer first makes a lump sum payment into a multi-sig address, that is jointly controlled by payer and payee. This is the establishment of the channel, from which incremental amounts are paid. Double spending would require a signature from the payee, who presumably will not agree to defraud himself.\n\nThe payer also can't be defrauded of his initial deposit because a nLockTime transaction is used as a refund transaction to be broadcast in the event the payee disappears with the deposit.\n\nYou can read more about it [here](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Contracts#Example_7:_Rapidly-adjusted_.28micro.29payments_to_a_pre-determined_party)": 1, 'Yes, you\'re right, we should update that.
