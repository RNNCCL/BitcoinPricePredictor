As long as demand>= current demand that price increases.': 2, "I believe you are right and that in practice, this event is already priced in.\n\nTo play devil's advocate though, the current main demand for bitcoin appears to be speculative holding. This is visible from the number of coins that have not moved in months (there was a chart of this on the sub recently, the vast majority of coins have not been touched in many months). So, the main source of supply on the exchanges is mining, and the main source of demand is holders (new or old) buying to hold. Day trading is a major activity of course, but it is not the main source of demand (and it can't be, by definition). So, when the halving happens, you will have half the new coins coming in compared to a presumably unchanged amount of buyers. Half the supply, same demand => price increase. In theory. There are obvious reasons why it's not quite as simple as that.\n\nEdit: Another theory is that some of the mining pools are currently dumping their coins on exchanges at a high rate in order to keep the price down and keep competitors out of the market, ie. engaging in a loss-leading strategy. If that is the case, and it's purely speculation, it would be expected that they'd wind that down ahead of the halving in order to reap the benefits of mining with fewer competitors.": 1, "Yep, the halving doesn't increase the price because it isn't a surprise to the market.

Your essential business decision (as it relates to the bitcoin price) is if you should sell your BTC and invest in more hardware or not. IF you can mine profitably (as measured in BTC), the answer to this question is "yes", you should sell BTC and buy mining hardware, since this will increase your BTC holdings over time.\n\nAs the date of the reward halving approaches, this calculation changes. The amount of BTC you can expect to recoup from an investment in mining hardware shrinks more the closer you get to the date. In particular, after the halving, the expected return is likely to be significantly lower. This shifts the equilibrium incentive of selling BTC and buying hardware upwards (towards a more expensive BTC).

Also Blockchain.info 2FA is fairly useless since you don\'t need the 2FA to send once an attacker has your BCI wallet.\n\nMultisig wallets with 2FA are good, trezor is good, mycelium is good.': 2, 'I drew a firearm during league play ': 2, 'Thank you Mandrik, I would appreciate if you kept the transaction details private.': -3, 'But BC.I users have control of the private key, no?': 2, 'You use the recovery seed. \n\nHave a look at Breadwallet or Mycelium or Electrum for an example of how this works. ': 2, '>Storing that much in any web wallet is not a great idea, but especially not BCI\'s web wallet.\n\nI think it depends on the individual.  That\'s a lot of money to most people, but not everyone.  \n\nAlso, I don\'t think it\'s cool to be targeting blockchain.info as "especially" a bad choice.  My guess is that they have about 25% market share, and more wallets than coinbase.   That\'s a lot of bitcoin.  The reused R value bug resulted in a tiny fraction of bitcoin being stolen, which is unfortunate, but not really that much.  More importantly, because they are designed to let the user control private keys, the issue was incremental, not catastrophic.  If a bitcoin bank-like service that controls most of the deposits has an issue with internal theft, that\'s an h-bomb, whereas this is a firecracker.  I\'m sure they will fix their release processes so that critical code like RNGs will have a code review before release going forward.  That\'s easy to fix.  It\'s just implementing rules and taking away production credentials from developers.  They get over it.\n \nRelated to the actual attack that was used against blockchain.info, that\'s not something the other wallets could have defended against either.  I don\'t care if you have a 255 completely random complex password with 2FA, it would make absolutely no difference. \n\nThat was an SSL stripping attack through a TOR exit node. This is where someone sets up a page that looks like blockchain.info, maybe has a lock favicon just like you would see at an https:// domain, but the page presented to the user on redirect is http://. The crook then establishes a real https:// session with the company, passing through the data the user enters in to the fake http:// site via this "real" https:// session.\n\nThis allows the crook to spoof the user, get their email, password, and most importantly, get a valid 2FA token - courtesy of the user who enters it into the http:// site, making all of the traffic visible to the crook.\n\nThis attack doesn\'t have to be through a TOR exit node, you can also set up a domain that looks *similar* to the real one, and pay to have the search results boosted in google or other search engines. The user may never know they are using a fake site at all.  Most don\'t, or so I\'m told.\n\nOne of the few ways to stop this type of attack is through a page "signature" check that looks for discrepancies between how the page customers enter data into is rendered vs the known "real" page that the customer should be visiting.  There are 3rd party companies offering these services usually under the umbrella of "anti malware" (even though it\'s really not anti-virus, but plaintext phishing site detection), but they have a pretty high false positive rate.\n\nSo that attack was pretty sophisticated, and is one of the few ways there are to defeat 2FA. That attack would have taken out 99% of web wallet providers, assuming someone went through the trouble of setting it up. Blockchain.info was just targeted first, who did that is anyones\' guess... although I\'m sure there are theories.\n\nThat said, if you avoid TOR unless you use their .onion URL, or always type https://blockchain.info into your browser (or bookmark it), you\'re pretty secure with 2FA and a little care to check the address of the site / certificate.  You also can use their browser extension if you want to avoid release problems with RNGs, etc.  So yeah, I don\'t agree that we all need to be hiding under a rock with our bitcoin.  For real safety, paper wallets > Trezor.  I love the idea of Trezor, but that device is very new, and not at all proven safe.  Any point in the supply chain, or a crooked insider could make your bitcoin vulnerable.  I don\'t think that\'s the case, but for really big balances, nothing beats a paper wallet, especially with multi-sig.\n\nI\'m not a blockchain.info employee, by the way. I run Novauri.com, so I\'m in the process of figuring out ways to stop these attacks before we go live next year.  I just don\'t think it\'s fair to bash blockchain.info.

It seems like an interesting compromise halfway house solution, and I like halfway house compromises in principle as long as they\'re not ugly. However, unfortunately I see a few reasons why it\'s not that effective:\n\n1. One of the key touted benefits to sidechains for users is that they share Bitcoin\'s currency network effects by using the same currency. However, a partially pegged sidechain does not have this advantage; it is rather a floating-rate asset, and so has the same problems as a full-on altcoin.\n2. It still has the complexities and risks of an external dependency (namely, bitcoin). For example, if one of my reasons for using ethereum is that it is (eventually) using PoS and I think PoS is good and PoW doomed to failure, then I will be scared that eventually BTC will get attacked and the sidechain economically screwed up as well.\n3. It\'s extra complexity generally.\n\nHence, partially pegged side-chains seem to have maybe 50% of the benefits of side-chains to users but 100% of the downsides, so unfortunately won\'t work. Now the one idea I do like is doing a "sharedrop" distribution where 50% of the tokens in a new currency go to holdings of previous currencies that could be said to have been the source of the portion of that ideas in the new currency\'s blockchain protocol that aren\'t innovative. This also reduces dilution risk, but without any additional infrastructural complexity at all. ETH obviously skipped this step, but in the long term this would be solved retroactively because any currency that was thinking of sharedropping to ETH can simply redirect 50% of that sharedrop to ETH\'s ideological progenitors (namely, BTC, MSC, XRP) instead.': 1, 'I see the dilemma and honestly it can go either way.

With SCs, this is no longer the case. 10 blockchains each with 100 tx/sec will have more validators than 1 blockchain with 1000 tx/sec, because a larger set of individuals have the resources needed to take part in validation when transactions are split into a larger number of smaller blockchains.\n": 0, "Like it or not, Luke Jr's name is attached to Blockstream (via the paper) and through his contract work.

Innovation will just move to another country.\n\n**Bitcoin network scalability** could easily delay adoption if a series of network disruptions occur.

I bought around 100 bitcoins a couple of years ago when they where around 130$ each. A very risky investment that turned out to pay off.\n\nThe reason I invest in Bitcoin is beacuse I feel that I understand it and the risks associated much better than any other investment I could make, and that the current price is low compared to the potential to succeed and risk of failing. Don't get me wrong, I think that there is a rather large risk of Bitcoin failing.

The money in my bank or Paypal accounts are not really mine. They are just a promise of money I can ask for in the future. And sometimes that promise is broken. Sometimes the answer is 'no'. It is my view that banks and traditional payment networks like Paypal and credit card providers have gotten so used to their power that they don't have to treat their customers with any respect or give competitive value for fees paid. They seem to peddle around in their own little pond with very little innovation and government programs to suck dry one after another.

This is why the phrase "privitization" exists.\n\nNow on to the subject of I.P. addresses, as this is interesting.  Two things make them rivalrous: you can only consume one individual ip address at a time; there is a limited number of ipv4 addresses available.\n\nThe ipv4 issue is not really relevant.  What is interesting is more the fact that domain names are restricted to a single individual at a time.  Unfortunately they are not exclusive because their BENEFIT is accrued by multiple individuals (anyone who now uses the domain name to navigate the web instead of typing in the address).  You can think about domain names like ebooks.  Everyone can use them but their production is rivalrous, because you can\'t just write the same novel someone else wrote.  You simply can\'t exclude them from reading it once you make it an ebook though.\n\nI can modify someone else\'s ebook and sell it as my own (think about purchasing "bestcookware.com" because someone else has a site "greatcookware.com"), and it\'s roughly analagous.\n\nEdit: if you are concerned about my disregarding the whole "ipv4" business let me explain it like this.  The notion of rivalry depends on crowding.  If there is no crowding there is no rivalry.  There is never supposed to be ip crowding.  If there is ip crowding the protocol has failed.

If a good has public externalities it is not summed horizontally but vertically in some component.  A purely private good has no vertical sum of benefits accrued to society, only horizontal.\n\nYou are wrong about rivalry and crowding, I\'m sorry.  I can give you an example that is usually given in an economics class.\n\nPublic parks: you build one and it is nonrival and nonexcludable.  (This is why people usually talk about them as though they are public goods, and for the most part, this works out to be true in practice).  However, now imagine you have 500 people in a park with a 1000 person capacity.  Look-- it\'s still nonrival, still nonexcludable.  However, now put 1000 people in the same park.  If there are no more people that can fit into the park it has become perfectly rival and nonexcludable.\n\nThis is the concept of "crowding."  It\'s applied to things like emergency medical care (which is a public good in some places until it becomes crowded, at which point it is a rival good because you have to wait in line).  The point here about IP addresses is that they only become rival if there aren\'t enough of them to go around.  As it is meant to work, an IP address is never crowded out.\n\nIf you\'re curious about the discussion above about externalities and the way that one adds the benefit of a good, let me know.  I can go more in depth into that if my explanation wasn\'t clear.\n\nEdit: as a side note, bitcoin actually doesn\'t have externalities.  You\'re confusing a positive externality with the absence of a negative one-- for example, using dollars generates the negative externality of physical object transportation.  When you pay with a dollar, it imposes a cost on the person who receives it because they have to then move it around (and maybe this cost is tiny, but there are other ones).  There is no benefit accrued to anyone else by the use of bitcoin, nor are there external costs accrued by the use of bitcoin (there are costs paid to use it, but they are perfectly internalized [tx fees+electricity]).  The absence of the costs means the production curve of society does not change with the use of bitcoin but rather approaches its maximum.': 1, 'fiat assimilated ': 1, "Ok, NXT.

Bitcoin is theoretically important because there has never been a virtual private good before it.  That is the only reason.  You can do all sorts of things with private goods and it has nothing to do with their market price (for example you can bargain with them and everyone can pay an individuated cost).": -3, 'What?  Nono, think about it like this.\n\n> Hello sir, I would like to sell you bread.  I would like $1 for this exchange.\n\nThese are both private goods.  It works because you can tell him "yes" or "no" and you\'re paying him or not paying him the value of $1.\n\n> Hello sir, I would like to sell you bread.  I would like you to clean trash up from my establishment for 1 minute in exchange for this piece of bread.\n\nNow even if 1 cleaning trash is worth $1 of your time, what you\'re paying isn\'t $1 because the value of cleaning trash spills onto other people (the neighbors of this guy and anyone who walks past, for example).  Instead, if the world were ideal, you\'d do less than 1 minute of trash cleaning, because you should do the amount of work that equivocates to the value of your work for SOCIETY.  (I.e. if your work is worth $1, you should stop when you\'ve done $1 worth of increasing society\'s value) But the bread vendor in the **real** world has no reason to accept 50 seconds of cleaning trash if the going rate for his bread is $1, and that\'s what he\'ll have to pay if it\'s worth $1 of time.  So this dude who could have let you get the bread for 50 seconds of work will refuse to do that because the price is too low to him (since he lacks incentive) and too high for you if he asks you to do 60 seconds worth of work (why not just pay him $1 and save yourself the work?).\n\nYou can\'t pay for goods without private goods to pay for them with, or else the cost incentive and benefits accrued are not efficient.\n\nOf COURSE you could do this without bitcoin.
