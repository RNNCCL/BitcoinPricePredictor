But he\'s a gold bug.  He is used to using the term "money" in its accurate, technical sense -- to describe something with guaranteed future value.  The value of gold, the minimum value at least, is guaranteed by the laws of physics.\n\nBitcoin, on the other hand, has no guaranteed future value.  It is accepted voluntarily.  It is open source.  Unlike gold which has certain irreplaceable properties, there\'s nothing preventing someone from creating a copy, or multiple copies, of the entire Bitcoin ecosystem.  The price of Bitcoin floats based on supply and demand and could, under the right circumstances, feasibly go all the way to zero.\n\nSo Bitcoin is not "money" in the classical sense.  And there\'s no reason it should be.  Regulators like to use terms like "virtual" and "money" to describe Bitcoin, solely because they want to regulate it.  But words have meanings.  And Bitcoin isn\'t either of those things.  It can\'t legally even *be* regulated.\n\nNow, one could argue that, metaphorically, a widely-used currency is a new kind of money.  It has future value based on widespread acceptance.  And that is the theory behind Bitcoin, of course.  But that value is not guaranteed.  Widespread acceptance could end at any time.

That massive flow of wealth between those three groups of people is the main economic effect of bitcoin.": -1, 'Global Remittance is about $700 Billion a year. If BTC picks up 1% of that it is $7 Billion dollar of Bitcoins that needs to be purchased.

If the price went to 3000 $/BTC, they would get about 11 million $/day.  \n\nThe only source of this money is the new investors who buy bitcoins to increase their holdings.  They also are the source of the profits of earlier investors who are selling or spending their coins.  There seems to be no way to estimate this volume, but it must be at least several hundred thousands of dollars.\n\nSo, in 2018, in order to sustain the price at 3000 $/BTC, with 12.5 BTC/block rewards, it would be necessary to find investors willing to put at least 5.4 million dollars every day of their money into the bitcoin system.  That money will promptly leave the system through those two streams, and never come back.\n\nThe only thing that could motivate those new investors to do that in 2018 is their hope of becoming "early investors" at some later date and cashing out for a large profit.  If they count on cashing out (say) at 5000 $/BTC by 2021, then they must believe that in 2021 there will be new investors willing to pour in 9 M$ for the miners, and at least another 9 M$ to buy the coins that they bought in 2018, *every single day*.

I am not surprised as there isn't one which can be easily described despite what you spout on here.": 2, '> It sounds as if you ignored that a trade has always 2 sides (buyer/seller)\n\nIn the simplest case, a "new investor" gives money to directly to a miner or to an "earlier investor", in exchange for a coin that was mined and never sold, or was bought on some earlier day. The new investor then holds the coin at least for the rest of the day.  In practice there may be several traders and services in between, but since coins and money only pass quickly through them, they can be ignored when you want to see what effectivey happens to the money.\n\n> Or are you implying that bitcoin can\'t decouple from fiat currencies?\n\nThat doesn\'t matter.  If there were no other currencies involved,  then the new investors would have to put real goods and services into the system, in exchange for bitcoins, and the miners and earlier adopters will take those goods and services out.\n\nSo, for example, instead of a miner getting 6300 dollars for the 25 bitcoins that mined, he would be able to get a ton or nickel or a used car instead.  Someone would have to provide those goods, or other goods of the same value, in exchange of 25 bitcoins, and hold the latter at least to the next day. \n\nYou would still have the same picture: every day, the new investors who are increasing their holdings put wealth into the bitcoin system, and miners and earlier adopters who are reducing their holdings take that wealth out. \n\n(Some money/wealth is also skimmed by the middlemen in that flow, such as exchange owners, fund managers, etc.; but let\'s assume that the amount is not significant.  In any case, their fees and profits also come from the input provided by the new investors.)': 4, 'You are only counting investors buying to increase holdings.

If the gas station owner pays 20 $/day for the same fuel at the refinery, that is **the gas station\'s** "cost of fuel".    What is "cost" for one entity is "revenue" for its suppliers; so you must always note "for whom" when you say "cost".\n\n> If the number of miners increased tenfold today then the costs of the network would rise commensurately. \n\nThe cost **for the miners** would increase enormously, but the cost of mining **for the bitcoin system** would be the same, 3600 BTC/day.\n\n> Bitcoin mining has no direct effect on the bitcoin price. Bitcoin exchanges don\'t care about mining difficulty. \n\nTotally correct, and I never wrote otherwise.  But not in the opposite direction: the bitcoin price has a strong effect on the cost of mining for the bitcoin system.  In fact that cost is proportional to the bitcoin price.  If the price were to double, the miners would suck twice as much value from the bitcoin economy, namely 1.8 M$/day instead of 900 k$/day.

Just to make it clear I too hate Paypal, but their solution/reason it sucks is wrong. Lots of uneducated opinions in that thread (and I do mean uneducated as opposed to "disagrees with me").\n\nPaypal has very little competition, because they are one of the only companies where you can make payments to *almost* anyone of importance in the world (not that people in Africa aren\'t important, but I don\'t need to do business with most of them). Their shady business practises wouldn\'t last very long if there were companies they had to compete with.\n\nThis is from [Peter Thiel\'s interview:](https://youtu.be/FMDlhy-ZTNo?t=10m3s)\n\n>"With respects to finance we\'re generally in a more heavily regulated world [than when paypal started] and so it might actually be very difficult to start paypal today. I\'m not even sure you could build paypal today, because the regulations are tougher. There was somewhat lawlessness, somewhat greyzone in 99/2000. Today it might be much harder to get started, much higher barrier to entry. [People are trying]. We\'re seeing much higher regulatory headwinds and that is a real worry."\n\nSo today, lets say you want to start off in just the major economies (sorry, had to exclude a couple of places like China because I know little of their laws). Where do you need to be licensed?\n\n**United Kingdom:**\n\nTechnically you can be licensed anywhere in Europe but this is where most Fintech companies choose to get licensed in Europe. You have the best access to lawyers, FinTech thinkers, etcetera in London.\n\nThis comes under Electronic money regulations, and once licensed you can passport your license for free to the rest of Europe, as well as Switzerland. This will cost you a \xc2\xa35,000 fee (tragic) and you will have to prove that you hold 350,000 euros in liquid capital. Fairly reasonable but of course you have legal fees, and restrictions on what you can do (for example you cannot pay interest).\n\nYou have a number of reporting requirements but nothing too heavy, really all you have to submit is suspicious activity reports. (Over simplification, but that is the main one).\n\nThis process will take around 6 months.\n\n**United States:**\n\nYou need 50 money transmitter licenses, and need to be a federally registered money service business. There are a large number of fees/capital adequacy issues. Most states require that you put funds into a special account that you cannot touch. \n\nThe whole process takes years to become fully compliant. For example [Pre-Cash](http://www.precash.com/precash-licensing.html) started gaining their licenses in 2006 and gained new licenses as recently as *2014*.\n\nReporting is a nightmare, have to report which direction the wind is blowing when a customer walks through the door.\n\n**Canada:**\n\nYou don\'t actually need to get a license, well done Canada!\n\n**Australia:**\n\nYou need to become a licensed Financial Service, there are two levels of this - Wholesale and Retail. You can have just a Wholesale license which allows you to accept customers who meet the following criteria:\n\n>1. You intend to make every transfer in excess of AUD $500,000 (or equivalent).\n>2. You are a business that employs 20 people or more (100 or more for businesses within the manufacturing industry).\n>3. You are a High Worth Individual (HWI) that:\n>a. has a gross income for each of the last 2 financial years of at least AUD $250,000; or\n>b. has net assets in excess of AUD $2.5 million (or equivalent);\n>c. and can provide an accountant\xe2\x80\x99s certificate dated no more than six months ago confirming one of the above.\n>4. You are a business or trust that is controlled by a HWI that meets the criteria above.\n>5. You are deemed to be a Professional Investor by:\n>a. holding a financial services licence or equivalent;\n>b. being regulated by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) or equivalent;\n>c. being registered under the Financial Corporation Act 1974;\n>d. being a trustee of a superannuation fund, an approved deposit fund, a pooled superannuation trust or a public sector superannuation scheme and the fund, trust or scheme has net assets of at least $10 million;\n>e. having or controlling gross assets in excess of $10 million (including any assets held by an associate or under a trust that you manage);\n>f. being listed entity or a related body corporate of a listed entity;\n>g. carrying on a business of investment in financial products, interests in land or other investments and for those purposes, investing funds received (directly or indirectly) following an offer or invitation to the public, within the meaning of section 82 of the Corporations Act 2001, the terms of which provided for the funds subscribed to be invested for those purposes.\n>6. You are a related body corporate of any body corporate that is a wholesale client.\n\nYou need to have professional indemnity insurance, and be part of a dispute resolution that ASIC has approved of.\n\nFees are pretty low on this one, less than $3,000 initially. However reporting is a different matter, you have to report an awful lot of stuff. Every transfer over x amount, etc. Can be automated though, mostly.\n\n**New Zealand:**\n\nSort of regulated, sort of not. \n\nYou have to register yourselves with the CO, however there is no licensing of the such.  You need to register with a dispute resolution scheme if you want to accept retail customers.\n\nI don\'t know much about reporting here, sorry.\n\nIts pretty easy to get registered, in fact Bitcoinica was registered in New Zealand.\n\nhttp://www.business.govt.nz/fsp/app/ui/fsp/version/searchSummaryCompanyFSP/FSP207625/7.do\n\n\n\nAnd the best part? With all of these countries you must have an active staffed office, with senior members working at it. Of course, this is a very short list, with just the countries I\'ve taken a glance at, but the list goes on. Most countries have licensing requirements - in Pakistan of all places it costs $2,000,000 to become licensed - and that is not as a bank! South Africa, Mexico, Japan, they all have their own requirements.\n\nAnd then you have risk. Banks are so over-regulated that they shit themselves whenever something is any one of the 50 shades of grey. Paypal found it easier to become a licensed bank in Luxembourg to accept debit/credit/other Euro payments than to work with banks directly as they could keep correspondent relations rather than current accounts.\n\n\nAnd then you get people who say shit like this:\n\n>While actively fighting being classified as a bank because then they would have to follow federal banking laws.\n\nBravo, you dipshit. Lets take a market that is already full of crony-capitalism, and further increase barrier to entry. Someone get this guy a Nobel prize. There is complete disregard for the actual functions a bank performs.\n\n>That is for valid reason: A bank accepts "deposits" (paypal doesn\'t), operates on fractional reserve (paypal doesn\'t), and issues debt/securities (paypal doesn\'t). Paypal is a payment system, is an issuer of electronic money. That is "banking" service they offer, and there already is regulation for that in almost every first world country (minus Canada) and that is a money transmitter (US), or e-money issuer (EU)\n\n\n</rant>\n\nTL;DR\n\nSo. Many. Licenses. No you can\'t have one. Hate on Paypal, but please keep it accurate.': 6, 'Not even that.

As more large and well-funded providers are fighting for market share, Western Union has been thriving in the last 2 years with breakthrough in its Digital division and overall leapfrog in social media. And that is the biggest "blind spot" of proponents of recent entrants and bitcoin-based remittance startups. They have an image, a wishful thinking, that Western Union is a cash-only business which missed telephony and stayed with telegraph till 21st century.\n- However, Moneygram has struggled in that space and is now finally trying to catch up\n- Their stock prices are reflecting of said distinction\n\nIndustry-wide (e.g., is there some significant "value" in the remittance market that a new technology could disrupt?)\n\nLet\'s first sort through a pecking order using 2014 revenues (current Market Cap)...\n- Western Union: $5,6B ($10.1B)\n- Moneygram: $1.4B ($0.5B)\n- Xoom (company): $0.159B ($0.6B)\n- WorldRemit: $0.025B ($0.5B)\n- Remitly: $0.002 ($0.05B) - my best guess, welcome others to chime in\n\nSo after so many years, Xoom is still 1/30+th of Western Union. Why? Part of it is Xoom\'s online-only channel which has much smaller margins. I.e., their transaction volume in online for USA is probably 2-3 times higher than Western Union\'s. Another reason is the focused business model of targeting customers who value good service-technology and are willing to pay for it. Xoom usually has higher FX markup across other corridors. Btw, so far, similar model also seems to be the case for Remitly and WorldRemit while TransferWise competes more aggressively on price. \n\nSo international remittances in top corridors is already a fiercely competitive fight for customers with razor-thin margins (for USA-India, #1 global destination - close to 0.5% total margin including fee and FX markup). As usual in such fights, to win a respectful market share would require much more than a technology and money, there needs to be a "dream team". Then, maybe, such bitcoin entrant could catch up with Xoom... in 5-10 years.\n\nIf you don\'t want to be perceived like a bubble community, it is important to have practical milestones that others could relate to.

I haven't used my Circle or Celery accounts nearly as much, but the limits for those accounts is far lower and applied *weekly*.

All three companies state their limits are based on usage history, and they all invite you to contact them with requests to raise limits.  \n\nIt couldn't hurt to contact Coinbase, Circle and/or Celery directly to see if any of them is willing to arrange for your needs as a special case. They'd likely need to agree to a domestic wire transfer (with a fee, of course) to send larger amounts with any speed, but if you can get one of them to go along, they may be more willing to do the transaction at close to exchange pricing. You may also be among the first to try this, so your case could be worth some PR to the company that gets your business.  \n\nA final option may be to send the bitcoin from the sale to a foreign exchange like [Bitfinex](https://www.bitfinex.com/) or [Bitstamp](https://www.bitstamp.net/), liquidate them on the market and send an international wire transfer to your receiving bank.

This definition is absurd and no actual business works that way.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Mike Hearn*\n\nIt seems to me part of the disagreement between Mike and Peter is a different understanding of mining incentives resulting in a different analysis of the game theory involved.  Let\xe2\x80\x99s consider two types of miners:\n\n**1.\tLow cost miner** \xe2\x80\x93 This miner is at the bottom of the mining cost curve, (i.e. they have one of the lowest costs of hashing in the industry) perhaps they have cheaper electricity.  This miner is likely to have a long term perspective and behave more consistently with the way that Mike expects.  The miner is likely to be around for years and cares about the long term health and sustainability of the network.  Even if bitcoin prices fall, other higher costs miners will exit the industry first and the fall in the network hash rate may mean this miner sees only a minimal (if any) impact on profitability.\n\n**2.\tHigh cost miner** \xe2\x80\x93 This miner is at the top of the mining cost curve, perhaps they have the most expensive electricity costs in the mining industry.  This miner may have a more short term perspective and behave in a way more like Peter expects.  The miner could be struggling, making losses, running out of cash and desperately trying to remain operational, in desperate hope of either an increase in bitcoin prices or fall in the network hash rate.  This miner may not care about the long term sustainability of bitcoin and operate in a RBF type manner.\n\nIn summary both Mike and Peter have valid points and are partially correct.  Hopefully there will always be many miners on different parts of the cost curve, with different behavioral incentives, resulting in a more robust network.  If one were to draw a mining cost curve, the shape could be very interesting.  The level of convexity or trend in bitcoin prices could determine the proportion of the hash rate producing bitcoins close to the marginal cost and therefore a risk of RBF type activity could increase.\n\nWhilst I agree with almost all of what Mike says, he appears to be only considering this from a micro perspective.  There are macro situations which can impact on the behavior of miners across the industry.\n\n**Healthy mining industry** -  http://www.minecost.com/typical.gif\n\nThe image above is a typical mining costs curve, from the resources industry.  I think this is a healthy state which results from stable commodity prices.  However if bitcoin is in a long term bear market, such that the price moves towards the saddle point in the curve, large parts of the industry could come under stress and the RBF scenario could apply.\n\n\n**Miners under stress** - http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-cA-3N-AHnaU/VAtfH_7nt3I/AAAAAAAAA4o/eaSJlN6HnYA/s1600/Gold%2BCost%2BCurve%2BGoldcorp%2BSept%2B14.GIF\n\nThis image illustrates the current cost of mining gold, after the price of gold has fallen, some of the largest miners in the industry are now producing with costs at or near the gold price.  These miners are focusing on short term profit maximization and could be forced to implement RBF type measures by their owners.  I think this could be a a genuine long term risk to the bitcoin network.  Although I acknowledge bitcoin mining has some very different characteristics from mining for traditional resources, most notably that as the higher cost bitcoin miners exit the market, the cost falls for everyone else.\n\n\n\n': 6, "I think this is a great idea.\n\nCan you elaborate more why it's not the right approach?

So transaction fees are currently only about 0.5% of a miners income... Let\'s skip ahead a few years and pretend that the block reward is now 12.5 BTC and average fees collected per block doubled to 0.162 due to higher tx volume etc... that\'s still only about 1% of the miners income.\n\nNow, out of that small % of miners income that comes from transaction fees, how much do you think it would go up purely from people using/abusing the RBF feature? I would wager a very tiny fraction.. Plus, unless *every* miner adopted it then it still becomes a game of chance for whoever wants to mess with a 0-conf ("why does this friggin\' undo button only work 5% of the time?!"). Nobody can use it effectively if no miners have adopted it, and no miners would adopt it if    nobody is using it effectively since there is no extra money to be made.. chicken and egg problem.\n\nOf course, the block reward will continue to drop over time and TX fees will take a much larger role eventually.

Bitcoin miners have pretty good control over this - if they don't violate the first-transaction rule, the fraud will be zero.

Today miners wouldn't do it because they'd effectively lose the original coinbase income, but once that income is primarily a function of fees, that motivation goes away as the remined blocks can be larger than the original.\n\nHowever, in a stable system where the first seen rule is being largely followed there isn't any incentive to do it either as your fellow miners will ignore your attempt to fork the chain.\n\nNow consider the RBF rule applied to blocks being implemented by default, like in Bitcoin Core. Suddenly it makes sense to go back and remine part of the chain because you know everyone else will do it too and because once you start remining transactions that were already mined, suddenly all those transactions that were previously confirmed have effectively become replaceable-by-fee again, so suddenly lots of people might try and undo their previous payments now they're safely at home with their nice new TV sitting in their living room.

The fraudster then ends up actually buying goods legitimately most of the time. They must then find a way to recoup their "losses" on things they don\'t actually want, but that\'s hard, because normally you would have to resell these second hand goods at a loss. So the fraudster is bleeding money every time an honest miner finds a block that doesn\'t include their double spend.\n\nAdditionally, each time you do this it\'s detectable. So not only is the fraudster losing money but they\'re also alerting the merchant that someone is trying to scam them. All it takes is one mistake by the fraudster e.g. providing a shipping address that they actually physically turn up to, and they can get caught and prosecuted for fraud. The combination of "you tried to double spend, then accepted the goods, and you have specialised double spending tools on your computer and we found the private keys that signed the double spend" adds up to a very easy prosecution.\n\nIt\'s worth remembering that there\'s no silver bullet for tackling payment fraud.

I considered e.g. 1 transaction a day, which can timestamp hundred thousands of documents to be acceptable. As people are already spamming regardless of some main devs oppinions, I was under the impression is was just something people want to do.\n\n"People want to do" is not an excuse to abuse the resources of others who may not want to do it. Regardless, I agree that a low volume datacarrier (OP_RETURN, not UTXO bloat) would be reasonably acceptable - but as mentioned Factom is already doing that. So for a new system, it would seem appropriate to overcome Factom\'s problems, especially this one.\n\n> I am not sure if that is "easy enough" for me. If you could point out some good links about merged mining and the system you mentioned above, I could study it better. My main concern with ChronoBit was that is is not as easy to use as a Web-Service in it\'s current state. I am more than happy if we can establish a standard which does not bloat the blockchain at all.\n\nhttps://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Merged_mining_specification\n\nWhat ChronoBit is mainly missing is a way to get data added as a non-miner. I would suggest extending Bitcoin\'s existing flood network for this, but I\'m not sure how to work out the fee side to prevent spam flooding (it becomes more obvious when Lightning is implemented to just setup micropayments to relay nodes and miners).': 1, 'Thanks will include it in the list tonight.\n\nEdit: Updated\n\n': 1, "Thanks for these links.

Very interesting.\n\nFactom seems kind of strange as it does a lot more than what timestamping alone would need. It introduces much more...\n\nI am not seeing through it clearly yet.

When I see it it kind of puts me off.\n\nI like the simplicity of some of these currently available methods.': 2, 'All Factom does is timestamping .... to a list using a decentralized protocol.\n\nThere are no other features, but the goal is a really complex one to achieve.': 2, "Yeah.  To provide the proof you show someone the original transaction, which they can hash, and you provide a merkle path that links this hash to the block's merkle root.  This is a trustless proof that the transaction existed in the blockchain.": 6, 'Agree with chinawat & platypii. Some nodes are likely to retain the full record. And even if only the blockchain headers are around you can still prove you timestamp if you retain the Merkle branch linking the transaction to the block. Also, OP_RETURN can be used to timestamp several docs, for example by arranging them in a Merkle tree.': 2, "I see. I can't dispute that a standard would make things easier both now and down the line. Good work getting this organized, I hope it comes together for you.": 2, 'OK thanks for that article. The method to timestamp is similar to others but the concept about including the previous block hash, to prove that a message or signature can not be older as a certain block is appealing.\n\nI will add it to the list. Thanks for sharing.\n\nEdit: List updated.': 1, 'I\'m not clear on why this would be needed over the existing "proof of existence"-type services. Just submitting a document to the Bitcoin block chain is already accurate to within a few hours. If you need more time specificity than that, you could sign your document or data with one or more trusted timestamping services, such as these free options:  \n\nhttp://truetimestamp.org/  \n\nhttp://www.freetsa.org/  \n\nand then submit the hash of the signed documents.  \n\nI\'m not aware than anyone has developed a truly decentralized time service, so including a selection of timestamps from several independent centralized services seems like it would be a good option.': 2, 'This. Thank you so much. Now I see and it seems a resonable bloat if the transactions are limited but maybe it is possible to even better by moving the hash to namecoin for instance as suggested below.': 2, "> Would this apply to a top hash being transformed into a Bitcoin address or to data being in OP_RETURN or both?\n\nEither.  Both are just the contents of a transaction.  Showing the document hash (or merkle root hash) inside a transaction, and linking that transaction to a block, proves the existence of the document at that point in time.\n\nPruning is only done by each individual node, it's not a feature of the blockchain itself.  Pay to pubkey hash outputs can't be pruned until they are spent as they are part of the utxo set so could be required for validating future blocks.  OP_RETURN outputs are unspendable so they can be pruned right away by nodes who aren't interested in that data.": 4, "It sounds interesting, I'll see, sir!": 2, 'Thanks a lot for this further explanation.': 1, '> Apart Eligius and p2pool is it feasible that other miners would jump on board?\n\nUnfortunately, I\'m not sure how likely that is. The easier it is to setup (and fewer resources), the better chance you have... this is just a short-term limitation in any case, assuming merge mining infrastructure gets properly decentralised as is needed for merge-mined sidechains (which I am working on).\n\n> Miners are not exactly known to be research companies but surely a good fee policy could help a lot.\n\nI\'d certainly expect fees to help incentivise miners to take it on.\n\n> It would be extremely important that the "pool of the mining pools" jumping on board would be able to mine at least one block per day if understand the proposal correctly. Am I wrong?\n\nNah, it just affects timestamp resolution. 1 block per week is good enough for 1 week resolution, for example.': 1, 'Apart Eligius and p2pool is it feasible that other miners would jump on board?\n\nMiners are not exactly known to be research companies but surely a good fee policy could help a lot.\n\nIt would be extremely important that the "pool of the mining pools" jumping on board would be able to mine at least one block per day if understand the proposal correctly. Am I wrong?': 2, "> It might be pruned in the future (OP_return has been created prunable)  \n\nI thought that once prunable outputs is fully available, nodes can still elect to record the full block chain record. If I'm right, anyone depending on the block chain for an existence record should probably take it upon themselves to be involved in maintaining at least one copy of such a complete record.  \n\n> It stores just one timestamped document per transaction  \n\nSeems like there are many workarounds. You could hash multiple document yourself and then submit the list of hashes to the block chain. Or you could compress multiple documents into one file and submit that file.": 2, 'You nailed it!': 1, 'Thanks': 2, '> I would think a more efficient system will be cheaper in the long run anyway.\n\nYes I would assume so as well. However, there seem to be some hurdles right now why almost all concepts which are used right now are TX based.\n\nI have just gone through the Factom paper and found a section where they explain why they use OP_RETURN an not the ChronoBit way or block header:\n\n> Two possible alternatives to the OP_RETURN data in the blockchain is anchored to the P2Pool\nheaders (as in chronobit) or in the Bitcoin block header coinbase. The P2Pool headers would\nrequire several hours of mining to find a block which satisfies the P2Pool rules, and the added\ncomplexity to the Factom protocol would not be worth the benefits. Including the Merkle root into\nthe coinbase of a block would require cooperation with miners, above and beyond the\ntransaction processing they are already doing. The coinbase entry would still need to have a\ncrypto signature from the Factom system, so would not save on much space relative to a signed\ntransaction. Not only would it be un-prunable, it would also be included in headers - first\ndownloads, affecting Bitcoin SPV clients.\n\nSo is the block header method what you would propose?': 1, "Well, you are the expert on the headers and their use, so we'll rework that section in the white paper.\n\nThe biggest reason we are not using the header the anchors in the headers is that we do not see how it can be done reliably and transparently using headers or ChronoBit.   We do know how to write transactions with OP_RETURN, and how to iterate over all OP_RETURN entries in Bitcoin that are written by anyone ever.  \n\nWe have many problems to solve to make Factom real.  We ABSOLUTELY want to transition to using Bitcoin headers once our tech goes live.": 3, '"There are some methods which are susceptible to pruning. These might have a problem in the future."\n\n.... PRUNING IS GOOD': 3, "> However, accepting the hashes and sending out the proofs needs some bandwith. Would that affect their latency?

They have to be so that new nodes can download the entire blockchain and validate it when syncing up. Furthermore, even if no nodes stored pruned data, a proof that a pruned OP_RETURN transaction appeared in the blockchain can always be validated because it has an unforgeable cryptographic link to the unpruned block header.': 2, "This thread has been linked to from another place on reddit.\n\n- [/r/BitcoinDev] [[X-post] We need a standard for Bitcoin blockchain timestamps!

Users can simply buy Entry Credits (which are non-transferable) from a Factom store for a steady real world price over time.  \n\nSo Factom provides a very simple protocol that allows users access to Bitcoin blockchain security with these features:\n\n*  Arbitrary data -- Defined by your application\n*  Separate Accounting -- Factoids and Entry Credits are managed separately from the data you are adding to Factom\n* Censorship resistance --  The commitment to write an entry is made (in the accounting side of Factom) prior to revealing the entry (in the data side of Factom).  \n* User defined Factom Chains -- Your applications can not only prove existence, but also the negative (an entry does NOT exist within your chains)\n* Very simple API -- Only requires a handful of calls \n* Provides proofs for all data against the Bitcoin Blockchain \n* A Factom Chain has a proof independent of all other Factom Chains\n* Factom is decentralized, so no central point of failure\n* Factom provides incentives that keep the protocol working as systems are added to and/or are removed from the protocol\n*  Factom can secure arbitrarily large sets of entries using Bitcoin's Blockchain without destabilizing Bitcoin's incentives\n* Writing data into Factom is cheaper and faster\n* Moving timestamped data to Factom from directly writing to the Bitcoin Blockchain can dramatically reduce bloat in Bitcoin\n* Factom can be scaled to handle very very large transaction volumes\n\nAnd there are more.
