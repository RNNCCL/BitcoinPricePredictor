I think what he wants Bitcoin to become is leaking into his rhetoric about what it currently is, just like all the other public speakers do in their own way. This is how I interpret:\n\n1. In the ideal case, Bitcoin is less efficient than centralized payment systems, since the latter has to do far less. Decentralization has a purpose, and it is not computational efficiency or reduced latency. *(However, if you include all factors, from dangers of regulatory capture to systemic risks, it could be argued that Bitcoin is indeed a better mechanism.)*\n2. Computational cost per transaction is high because of mining rewards. *(This is an odd way to look at it, since if we magically removed mining rewards, it\'s almost certain that difficulty would collapse, and average transaction fees are likely to converge to an amount determined by required security. It\'s hard to tell if it would be higher than credit card fees though. I think unsystem guys want to keep the maximum block size at 1MB, which would definitely result in high fees. All in all, I don\'t think Bitcoin will keep the limit, and I don\'t think the fees will ever be as high as credit card fees.)*\n3. Secure transactions require multiple confirmations, which can take up to an hour. *(Again, unsystem guys don\'t want people to rely on zero confirmation transactions, even though they are currently "good enough" for what they are used for. This issue has been debated ad nauseam, and remains to be mostly normative.)*\n4. Since the very same team developed software that brings consumer protection into Bitcoin, this is obviously pure rhetoric that urges people to see the system as a whole as Amir sees it.\n': 3, 'I was talking about Amir': 1, 'Nice Silk Road t-shirt, Amir.': 2, 'Depending on where you live, bitcoin can be insanely cheaper than credit card.\n\nI wonder where credit cards are cheaper than bitcoin.': 2, '"BYE Y\'ALL!"': 2, 'I think he was being hyperbolic to make the point that being "a slightly cheaper payment mechanism" is the least important thing about Bitcoin. Assuming you feel it necessary to move in and out of fiat for every Bitcoin transaction, (which is not necessary to eliminate volatility risks thanks to companies like Coinapult) you could make the argument that saving 1-2% is negligible.

I\'m also doing it to protect Bitcoin\'s, and my reputation.\n\nIn the early days Bitcoin was constantly demonised as a pyramid/ponzi scheme. Though disproving it as a ponzi is simple, convincing people that Bitcoin is not a pyramid scheme is much more difficult. \n\nPeople see some very hard core Bitcoin users and they are very passionate, so passionate that people may see them "selling" the idea of Bitcoin because it serves their self interest, and this is often used to demonise the technology, by painting users as con artists, in it to pump and dump Bitcoin because more users == higher price (trolls have been using this smearing tactic relentlessly for years). Because Bitcoin is so volatile, this can make people reckless, stories of 1000% gains in weeks does indeed sound amazing, who *wouldn\'t* want to get in on that, but this also makes us sound like we are trying to con people.\n\nI and many others in the early days rolled out that mantra whenever people looked like they were getting in over their head or overexcited in order to not only keep people from buying too much and risking their ire later when they don\'t make a fortune, or even lose a significant percentage of their money, but also to protect the reputation of Bitcoin users. I\'m hugely passionate about Bitcoin, but I don\'t want to be seen as a scammer, schemer, gambler, or reckless. I am not accountable to others that use Bitcoin and I don\'t hold others accountable for the consequences, good or bad, of my Bitcoin adoption.\n\nWhat you do with your money is your choice, but people shouldn\'t buy Bitcoin because others say it is a sound investment, or because it\'s going to make you rich, or because it will hold it\'s value over the long term, or because it\'s safe from seizure etc. Until Bitcoin shows very clear signs that it has stabilised to a degree where it fluctuates similar to other currencies I will continue to tell people to not risk more than they are willing to lose because it\'s the soundest advice I can possibly give, and reminds people that they need to hold themselves personally responsible for their decisions. This doesn\'t mean we should tone down the rhetoric though ;) there\'s HUGE benefits to using Bitcoins, but there\'s also huge risks too, and the more money that is involved, the more they are compounded.\n\nIt might seem good in theory, but telling people to "Only invest what you want to save" leaves you completely open for others to hold you accountable for convincing them to make a terrible financial decision, and absolves them of personal responsibility for their poor decisions.

For example, the chinese exchanges are 0% fees with a withdrawal charge, whereas other exchanges have trade fees. \n\nThere are also some hardware features that make china attractive, like cheap electronics and cheap electricity to make mining in china attractive.\n\nIn short, the chinese labor market is all about jumping onto stuff like bitcoin, and the political sphere is more than happy to encourage that.\n\nHowever, bitcoin is also risky because it creates a method of capital flight out of China. The country strictly controls the transfer of money out of the country and makes an effort to prevent it. One of the old-school ways was to take your millions to macau, buy some chips, then cash out for USD.

Colored Coins, Mastercoin, Bitshares and Ethereum have come in and add stories, creating networks.  Pegging technology is the next step of technological improvement in an interoperable way.  Built on top of Bitcoin in a way that does not result in spamming or watermarking bitcoin transactions that makes every transaction a bid/ask, saturating Bitcoin.  You don\'t need to do that.  Sidechain that is pegged to bitcoin, so there is no counterparty risk, no escrow agent holding your bitcoin.  Your bitcoin can move between networks which are tied, in that sense they are merged mined.  People can do their innovation in interoperable way.  Early days in TCP/IP, if every time somebody wanted to make media streaming, webpages, online shopping, each time they make a fork of TCP protocol, made a few changes so it is an incompatible network and said "great we\'ve done online shopping," yet none of these things talk to each other, you have to pull them out and put them back in to achieve anything.   So you get network effect by having interoperable systems.  So if we have different people working on micropayments, online shares, high frequency trading, to do all these things on different networks that are open networks, preserve the freedom to innovate, fully interoperable and operate with two-way pegs, best of both worlds: freedom to innovate, avoid the silo effect, and we avoid these self-defeating selfish \'newshares\' that some things get built on top of.\n\nIs their idea for people to move BTC to sidechain 1 and then automatically execute a contract with app logic hard-coded to the sidechain code? I was under the impression sidechains are duplicates of Bitcoin Core with added functionality. In which case, the sidechains would operate much more like an altcoin. You\'d need to convert BTC to the alt, and then store the alt in a compatible alt-wallet, and then you can do things with it. That is really not far removed from metacoins; the only difference is you don\'t have to speculate on the price of the underlying. Or maybe you do, because sidechains aren\'t proven to be secure?\n\nAlso, if we are speaking of futures contracts, that is placing large bets on the blockchain, and trusting it with very large trades. There would be a huge incentive to attack such a system. This is just to say, security of the settlement engine would be paramount to anyone. Bitcoin is today the world\'s most secure, and *neutral* token ledger, and it will likely always have the highest hashrate because of the fact that it is totally neutral.\n\nI\'d like to wager the real underlying problem Blockstream has with their competitors like Counterparty is not primarily to do with technical details. It\'s that so many people have been told BTC is all you ever need. The price your friends must bear to use Bitcoin for remittances is that they enrich all BTC holders. With Counterparty, people are worried the same will not happen for securities, options and derivatives trading. They want to be able to do it all using the same resources.\n\nI would just like to point out that this isn\'t a winner take-all battle between platforms. After listening to the CFTC hearings on Bitcoin, while Jerry Brito\'s explanation of Bitcoin was wonderfully clear, certain people are far more excited about using a fraction of a BTC to represent financial contracts than using it as currency. To that end, Counterparty transactions each incur a separate BTC transaction fee. So BTC is still the reserve currency to both systems. If sidechains works better for that than Counterparty, ok then launch it. Same thing to Open Transactions and their voting pools. Each team needs to launch their respective platform before pitting probable future features against live production code.': 4, "Well that's good to know. I'll keep an open mind to that.

That question is at the heart of Kaley v United States, a case the United States Supreme Court issued its decision on this week. The answer, worryingly, seems to be: None.\n\nThe case concerns an aspect of civil asset forfeiture (which we have written about before) that allows prosecutors to freeze an indicted defendant\'s assets before trial if they would be subject to seizure upon conviction. The question is whether defendants can challenge the forfeiture\'s legitimacy when it was based on a grand-jury indictment. A brief refresher: grand juries do not decide guilt or innocence; they simply decide whether enough evidence exists to charge a defendant with a crime, ie to indict him. Proceedings are usually closed to the public, and indeed to defense attorneys as well. Grand juries usually only hear evidence from the prosecutor. Historically, they had an investigative function as well\xe2\x80\x94they were supposed to scrutinise the government\'s evidence\xe2\x80\x94but many believe they are now little more than rubber stamps for prosecutors.\n\nIn this case, a grand jury indicted Brian and Kerri Kaley on charges of selling stolen medical equipment and laundering the proceeds. The Kaleys contested the allegations: they said the equipment was unwanted excess, and that they should not be charged with stealing something that nobody wanted. That argument convinced a jury to acquit a co-defendant, indicted along with the Kaleys, after the prosecution could not find a single witness who claimed ownership of the allegedly "stolen" devices. But it did not save the Kaleys.\nAdvertisement\n \n\nWhen they first learned they were under investigation, the Kaleys took out a $500,000 home-equity loan and used that to pay for a certificate of deposit in that same amount, which they set aside to pay their lawyers. But when the grand jury returned its indictment, the government froze their assets, including the $500,000 certificate of deposit, arguing that those assets were "proceeds" of their alleged crimes. The Kaleys requested a hearing at which they could argue that the assets should not be subject to forfeiture because their alleged conduct was not criminal. They also argued that the forfeiture froze funds they needed to pay the lawyer who had been preparing for two years to defend them. The prosecution even admitted that they could only trace $140,000 in allegedly criminal proceeds to the Kaleys. And so they did the reasonable thing and unfroze $360,000. Just kidding! What the prosecution actually did was indict the Kaleys on conspiracy to commit money laundering, which carries a much broader forfeiture remit, and allowed the government to seize even more of their assets, including their home. They contended that these seizures prevented them from retaining the counsel of their choice, which the Supreme Court has long held that the Sixth Amendment guarantees, and they contended that they were entitled to a hearing to challenge the freezing of their assets.\n\nIn an odd 6-3 split, which found Justices Roberts, Sotomayor and Breyer in the dissenting minority, the court ruled against the Kaleys. Justice Kagan, writing for the majority, says that the Kaleys have no constitutional right to "relitigate" the grand jury\'s finding of probable cause, which led to their assets being frozen. But as Mr Roberts notes in his dissent, that is not at all what they were seeking. They wanted a hearing not on whether there exists probable cause to charge them with a crime, but on whether their assets should be subject to forfeiture. The prosecution, and Ms Kagan, believes that the two are the same. They are not. As Mr Roberts notes in his dissent, a ruling on the forfeiture alone "would have no necessary legal or logical consequence for the underlying prosecution because it would be based on different evidence and used for a different purpose."  And, of course, nothing would be "relitigated", because nothing was litigated the first time: defendants are not present at a grand jury hearing, nor does the prosecution have any obligation to fairness. As a former judge famously remarked, a competent prosecutor ought to be able to convince a grand jury to "indict a ham sandwich."\n\nMr Roberts is absolutely correct in noting that Ms Kagan\'s ruling "pays insufficient respect to the importance of an independent bar as a check on prosecutorial abuse and government overreaching." And in the Kaleys\' case, the government has a strong financial incentive to overreach. They froze more than $2m in assets. If the Kaleys win, they get their money back; if they lose, the government gets to keep it.\n\nNone of this seems to trouble Ms Kagan, however. For her and her five colleagues, a grand jury\'s decision, reached after hearing only the prosecution\'s case, is sufficient to determine whether the government can take everything you own and prevent you from hiring your counsel of choice. The government need not conclusively link the assets seized to the crime; they can simply charge you, allege a link and take everything you own.\n\nMr Roberts\'s conclusion is so good it\'s worth quoting at length: "[F]ew things could do more to \'undermine the criminal justice system\'s integrity,\'... than to allow the Government to initiate a prosecution and then, at its option, disarm its presumptively innocent opponent by depriving him of his counsel of choice\xe2\x80\x94without even an opportunity to be heard. That is the result of the Court\'s decision in this case, and it is fundamentally at odds with our constitutional tradition and basic notions of fair play."': 26, "Escrow the $500k.
