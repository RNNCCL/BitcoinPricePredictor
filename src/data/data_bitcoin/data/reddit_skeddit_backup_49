The source of the document leak was never identified.\n\n\nWright has never publicly confirmed or denied the allegations. Nor has he made any public statements or appearances since the story came out. To the contrary, most of Wright\xe2\x80\x99s social media and web presence was deleted shortly after the story went public.\n\nAdding to the intrigue, Wright\xe2\x80\x99s Sydney home was raided by Australian federal police in connection to a Australian Tax Office investigation on the same day of the story\xe2\x80\x99s release. It is understood, however, that Wright and his family had by then already upped and moved to London.\n\nNow, after nearly four months of silence \xe2\x80\x94 and a bitcoin community mostly resigned to the notion that the story was an elaborate hoax \xe2\x80\x94 conditional approaches are being made to media and other institutions in connection to an upcoming \xe2\x80\x9cbig reveal\xe2\x80\x9d of Wright as Satoshi Nakamoto.\n\nThe narrative being pitched is that on a pre-agreed date \xe2\x80\x94 ranging from April 7 to April 14 \xe2\x80\x94 Wright will publicly perform a cryptographic miracle which proves his identity once and for all. Those institutions being offered the inside scoop on his life story, meanwhile, are supposedly being asked by those claiming to be Wright\xe2\x80\x99s legal representatives to abide by strict embargoes, timed to pre-empt the stage-managed revelations and the public press conference to follow.\n\nThe attempt at media management, however, echoes a familiar pattern.\n\nThe dossier of leaked emails used by Wired and Gizmodo as the source for their story was also heavily circulated to rival media outlets by anonymous parties weeks ahead of its ultimate publication.\n\nNotable authority figures from the bitcoin community are alleged to have been impressed by the processes Wright is using to prove his identity and are standing ready to endorse Wright\xe2\x80\x99s identity as Satoshi or are on the verge of doing so in the not to distant future.\n\nOne name referenced in that regard is Jon Matonis, a founding director of the Bitcoin Foundation. Asked for comment he told FT Alphaville: \xe2\x80\x9cI have been contacted by a private group and I am under a strict NDA [non-disclosure agreement] and press embargo during due diligence phase.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nWith respect to the technical processes which Wright would have to perform to prove his identity, Bitcoin developer, Gavin Andresen, told FT Alphaville the following in an emailed statement over the weekend:\n\nI\xe2\x80\x99d want to see:\nA message signed with the same PGP key Satoshi used back in 2010. (\xe2\x80\xa6but his computer could have been hacked)\nA message signed with keys from early Bitcoin blocks (\xe2\x80\xa6but his wallet could have been stolen).\nEmail or private forum posts he sent to me in 2010 (\xe2\x80\xa6 but email could have been hacked).\nA conversation about technical stuff, ideally via email, so I can see if it feels like the same person I communicated with in 2010.\nIrrespective of whether Wright convinces the bitcoin community he is or is not Satoshi, as long as a reasonable doubt exists in the minds of many his views could end up influencing matters in the current blocksize debate \xe2\x80\x94 a community schism over bitcoin\xe2\x80\x99s development and scaling, a split now threatening the entire bitcoin system.\n\nWill Craig Wright be the one to shepherd his flock to consensus and safety?

A little misinformation here and there but nothing too damaging. Biggest flaw was them calling GBTC an ETF. If a *real* bitcoin ETF launched it would trade at *much* higher volumes than GBTC. GBTC is illiquid because there aren\'t new shares created (i.e. bitcoins acquired) when capital flows in to the "fund", and there are only so many people willing to pay the premium it trades at to have pseudo-btc exposure in tax advantaged accounts. GBTC is really just a holding company that holds x bitcoin, issued x shares who\'s NAV representing "~1/10 of x bitcoin each", but it\'s so illiquid because it\'s AUM is fixed in terms of bitcoin (AFAIK). ETF\'s have to acquire more shares of the underlying upon capital inflows to the fund, which creates buying pressure on the underlying.
