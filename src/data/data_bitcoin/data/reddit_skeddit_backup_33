There is no inherent inter-participant anonymity on a private blockchain unless it is instant and permissions only the participants involved in a single transaction (see R3 Corda, also ILP). Also, thinking outside the tiny little bitcoin box, the overlay could possibly be used for multiple instances on the same blockchain, allowing for selective participation in different regulatory shards, or none at all (risky as that is).\n\nStep 4: Demonstrate poor understanding of PoW. PoW mining is, itself, a codified system of bribery intended to disperse authority but in practice leads to miner optimization, cartelization and a massive waste of energy overproviding security because it relies solely on direct bribery instead of properly aligning validator motivations with network performance. What's a little more bribery to add important features which proper money needs?\n\nStep 5: Ad hominem, but astute.

They recently tacked back publicly to XRP and some of us in the observer community weren't entirely clear why or how that strategy choice was made instead of just following their current profit model: consultation and integration services. \n\nIf ChainAnchor or GlobalID is part of their plan there is some sense to the move: they can now lock down their ledger even more so than it is AND provide flexible regulatory shards - meaning legitimacy from domestic governments, privacy from competition as well as foreign governments with interoperability between shards provided by FSB/MTS Market Makers holding their liquidity in XRP, the most frictionless asset on Ripple.

': 7, "In our company we work with blockchain technologies and we see a lot of Ethereum interest from financial markets. They have a lot of use cases where 2 or more computers should agree with something, and current technology doesn't allow to do it. With smart contracts on top of blockchain they could solve a lot of actual problems and may be do a lot of new things. In the future a program could read all the world news (I mean all even the local newspapers of all the world) and make investments small tendencies, something similar to what is called high frequency trading.": 1, 'blockchain rollout in banks is of course many years away lol. but it is rolling out in other places': 1, "Whoosh! This article completely misses the point. Yes, *permissioned* blockchains are not very exciting; it's the *permissionless* ones that are truly disruptive. The point about regulation limiting bitcoin's likely success also misses the point. Bitcoin, like the internet, routes around any hostile regulation. ": 15, "The Bitcoin Blockchain is a decentralized databases that everyone can use without any permission coming from anyone but the protocol. If it's restricted to a few people controlling then it's a shared but restricted database. It might make banks more efficient, I don't know, but it's not revolutionary. ": 2, "Banks have infrastructure in place to judge credit worthiness, but it's mainly government imposed and not based on what the free markets will dictate. No one can realistically compete with banks on a large scale because they have the ability to do fractional reserve. This advantage goes away with bitcoin. Bitcoin loans do not have to be anonymous. I think we'll see new technology like webs of trust that are far superior to the way banks determine credit worthiness. Also, in an equity based currency, borrowing money will become less important. ": 1, '> they will never come to an agreement who should have control over their settlement network, as nobody wants to give away power.\n\nThis is their Achilles heel and why they will be the laggards when it comes to adopting bitcoin once they realize they are losing relevance.  \n': 1, '....and they really dont know why. Bandwagon jumping is the only explanation. My guess is 12 months from now people will think R3CEV is an old AUDI stationwagon.   ': 1, "I don't see how it's fundamentally any different from what they're doing now, I think the best they can hope for is that cheating will be easier to prove. Even then I think it's hopeless.\n\nCan you imagine a bank going to court with some cryptographically signed documents and trying to prove fraud by explaining to a 70 year old judge how elliptic curve crypto works?\n\nIt's not going to work. If it relies on the legal system, well, that's what we have now, and it's corrupt.": 1, '> Interbank transaction confirmation and visibility can be enhanced with a likely speed increase in settlement time for transactions. \n\nMy SQL could certainly do that.  Blockchains would do pretty much the opposite.\n': 2, "You seem to be misunderstanding that banks and banking are not being disrupted by Bitcoin. Blockchain technology is something they are looking into to enhance the way banks communicate with each other and hold the database of transactions.\nBanks offer services and financial products which won't at all be disrupted by either Bitcoin or blockchain. \nRegulation holds the keys to disruption in the banking industry. ": -3, 'I don\'t think it will ever be "too late". They\'ll just miss a huge profit opportunity. In a bitcoin world, banks would still serve a useful purpose - loans. They would just be out of the business of "protecting" people\'s money.': 2, "It doesn't matter if you have irrefutable proof if no one is going to do anything about it.": 1, 'Fully agree. "Regulation" is in reality nothing else than a barrier to entry, a protection for an inefficient and mismanaged financial sector costing society hundreds of billions.': 3, "I love this.  They are literally saying that permissionless systems won't happen because they won't be permitted.\n\nGuess what: they already did *because they don't need permission..*": 2, "Actually that is the point. Cryptographic proof is 100\xe2\x84\x85 irrefutable, that is the problem for them they can't then bribe or make things their way. No matter the powerfully they are. You can't outlaw math you can refute maths.": 1, "> Blockchain technology is something they are looking into to enhance the way banks communicate with each other and hold the database of transactions. \n\nThe reason they are doing this is because they do not understand what blockchain technology is.  Eventually they will find out it can't enhance their communications with other banks.  Just like how rocket booster technology doesn't improve the nutrition in your breakfast, it is totally unrelated. ": 2, 'Banks can identify Bitcoin as their enemy. They can try to use a blockchain to settle their stuff, too, but in my opinion they will never come to an agreement who should have control over their settlement network, as nobody wants to give away power.': 2, 'This.': 1, 'Interbank transaction confirmation and visibility can be enhanced with a likely speed increase in settlement time for transactions. ': 1, "The reason banks make loans is because they create money through fractional reserve lending. We don't actually need them to do this. We can do this with peer to peer lending.": 1, '> Regulation means that new blockchain startups are unlikely to usurp banks\n\n"Unlikely" really depends on the future, doesn\'t it? How "likely" are these projections if parts of the world start spiraling into (deeper) financial stress, and that banks are to blame in a big way (again). If the dominoes start falling, you can wipe your ass with the regulations this time, people aren\'t falling for it anymore.\n\nSee, there is no "blockchain startup" to watch out for when it comes to usurping banks. There is however the decentralized Bitcoin network, which people can turn to when they realize that banks are corrupt and outdated, no usurping necessary.\n\n> Not one bank nor policymaker that we have met with on blockchain gives even a second thought to an unpermissioned public network\n\nOh you mean like a decentralized network that can do the whole job? Yeah that does seem like an unfavorable idea, for banks and their puppeted policy makers.\n\n> Let\'s be clear, whenever we meet C-suite of financial institutions, we see the hurdles and limitation of blockchain technology.That\'s to say they are insurmountable\n\nI have a feeling that Morgan Stanley\'s hurdles and limitations for rolling out the bankchain are very different from the hurdles and limitations of the Bitcoin network. I think only one has issues that are insurmountable.': 9, "It couldn't be simpler what these banks need to do to even start to try and get ahead of this wave that is going to sweep them away ... run some bitcoin nodes and buy some bitcoin.\n\nBut they will never do it until it is too late.": 3, 'Sure, banks would have no special authority to make loans. But they do already have a lot of infrastructure in place to judge credit-worthiness.\n\nThere will be no such thing as bitcoin loans to anonymous parties, since there will be no incentive to pay back the loan. I suppose there may eventually be some form of digital collateral, but so far only bitcoin could serve as collateral, which kind of defeats the purpose of a bitcoin loan.': 1, "Banks have the legal system to punish cheating, all they need is a system whereby if someone cheats, there's cryptographic proof of the cheating.\n\nA centralized system is perfectly capable of doing this. All it has to do is sign and publish its transactions, anyone subscribing to them can verify they're correct, and they'd have proof of cheating if they're not correct. Subscribers can compare notes, if they want to ensure that the central system is telling the same story to everyone.\n\nIf the banks want a system where cheating is prevented (vs just detected), then they might as well just use bitcoin. They don't realize this yet, of course. It'll take many years of failed experiments before it starts to dawn on them.": 1, 'Good, they should just ignore it.....': 2}}}
