Literally. For months now, a raging debate has been roiling the bitcoin industry over whether or not to increase the maximum size of a transaction block of data. The current maximum is 1 megabyte. Gavin Andresen, who heads up bitcoin\xe2\x80\x99s core developer team, has suggested increasing that to 20 megabytes, so as to facilitate the increased traffic the system is processing as bitcoin grows.\n\nThat may sound like a dry, technical issue. It is not. It touches upon the cornerstone of the decentralized system \xe2\x80\x93 i.e., how best to compensate the miners who run the network and give them the incentives to keep doing so \xe2\x80\x93 and it illustrates the sometime chaotic nature of building consensus amid a leaderless consortium. The debate is pitting the core developer group, led by Gavin Andresen, against the inchoate, far-flung miners, and is dragging in virtually everybody who has any stake in the system. It has sparked running battles across reddit and Twitter and the bitcoin message boards.\n\nOn Monday evening New York time, a U.K.-based start-up called coinwallet ran its own \xe2\x80\x9cstress test\xe2\x80\x9d of the bitcoin network, looking to flood the system with transactions in order to make a point: the systems current constraints are too small to handle increased traffic. \xe2\x80\x9cBitcoin is at a breaking point,\xe2\x80\x9d they wrote in a post on reddit. \xe2\x80\x9cIf nothing is done, bitcoin will never be anything more than a costly science project.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRepresentatives of coinwallet were not immediately available for comment. The test itself did reach its stated goal of clogging up the system with 200mb worth of transactions, because coinwallet\xe2\x80\x99s servers crashed before they got there. The group said it will run another test in seven days. If the servers don\xe2\x80\x99t crash, we all may learn bitcoin\xe2\x80\x99s real limits.\n\nWhile the initial test took people by surprise, it\xe2\x80\x99s very similar to a test that Visa Inc. conducts every August of its system. The most recent test, in August 2014, showed the system could handle 56,582 transactions per second (the actual peak volume the previous year was 13,236 transactions per second).\n\nThe number of transactions on the bitcoin network has been rising steadily, but has not yet bumped up against its limit. That 1 mb limit \xe2\x80\x93 which was put in as an \xe2\x80\x9canti-spam\xe2\x80\x9d measure - limits the system to seven transactions per second. On June 18, according to data from Blockchain.info, the system processed 133, 747 transactions \xe2\x80\x93 a record high. But that works out to 5,572 transactions per hour, or 92 transactions per minute, or 1.5 transactions per second. So the system isn\xe2\x80\x99t at the breaking point yet, but that\xe2\x80\x99s no reason to wait until it is.\n\nChanging the block size is technically simple. It requires rewriting the bitcoin code. But that change has to be accepted by consensus, because it requires the majority of miners adopted the updated software. If they didn\xe2\x80\x99t, you\xe2\x80\x99d have two different versions of bitcoin running. But changing the block-size limit alters the incentive system for mining, and here\xe2\x80\x99s where the fight heats up.\n\nA larger block-size limit \xe2\x80\x93 which could capture more transactions to be processed in one batch \xe2\x80\x93 raises the odds that a miner building a bigger block will lose out to one building a smaller block in the race to win the 25 bitcoin the system releases roughly every 10 minutes. That could raise the costs of running a mining operation and lower the profit. Miners who have built a business around the system\xe2\x80\x99s current parameters are, therefore, reluctant to agree to any changes.\n\nIdeally, supply and demand dynamics will sort out the incentive structure, no matter the block size (Mr. Andresen wrote about that here). The trick is getting the current crop of miners to agree to that, even if it goes against their interests in the short term.

The only person who could check someone like a Roger Ver in this system would be Satoshi.

It\'s possible Ver and other large holders would be benevolent.

A secure peer-to-peer (p2p) version of traditional online poker would allow trustless and provably fair poker games. This p2p approach would reduce the overall cost to players and add more value through incentive schemes designed to reward higher player participation. The Ethereum Smart contract system is a fully decentralized programmatic set of contracts using advanced blockchain technologies;[ ref. 5] that will power one part of this solution; and Telehash [a secured network real time mesh technology; ref. 28] based, peer-to-peer poker network consensus provides the other major component. We propose an alternative solution to the traditional mental poker problem by using a novel combination of smart contracts and meshed based player networks. These p2p networks will form consensus, which is secured through the Ethereum blockchain by the economic majority stake and irreproducible activity. During a poker hand, Individual player actions resulting in state changes are broadcast to all opponents at a table during the game session and verified through a challenge response protocol by pools of statistical models of the poker network called jury pools. The pools then verify the table opponents\xe2\x80\x99 copies of the current player broadcast against their received copies. Jurors (randomly selected players from the p2p poker network based on high stake and activity) are grouped into pools routinely, and replaced at regular time intervals by a system of contracts on the Ethereum network. Each node selected to a pool explicitly uses its stake as collateral and risks losing its stake if it breaks the network rules. This incentivizes fair play and creates a disincentive or very imbalanced risk/reward offering for potential cheaters. As long as the p2p network is sufficiently protected against large numbers of player nodes under the control of a single person/group (known as Sybil resilience), the poker consensus protocol can safely agree on the states of the games, the state of all player accounts, and therefore the state of the network. The Juror Pools will also agree on checkpoints to be permanently inserted in the parent blockchain each Epoch (a set of time-bound data allowing a summation of time that is divisible in 1 hour, 15 minute, and 1 minute increments). Dynamic members of the p2p poker network are updated using weak subjectivity [ref. 10] to the parent Ethereum blockchain. This means that nodes rejoining the network query and get the most recent epoch (last hour) of the network by querying the parent chain, then do the manual calculation to get up to speed on the current state of the network. This way nodes can be dynamic members of the p2p network leaving and rejoining the network with the guaranteed most up to date and secure state of the network, secured by the economic majority and activity of the network. The combination of: decentralized and randomized selection of jurors (via Ethereum smart contracts), decentralized mesh networks for p2p game interactions, and heavy use of advanced anti-cheating mechanisms will, by this submission, present the poker-playing community a new and fun platform for playing poker without requiring to trust any individual/single entity. This paper is intended to describe the basics of a fully decentralized poker game experience.\n\nPokererum basically proposes a zoom style seating arrangement that uses both stake and a proof of action/participation algorithm to secure the system. Then there is a randomly selected jury pool that verifies the gameplay. I think this would work and it effectively solves collusion but only with random seating.\n\nI propose on top of this a tweak I think that wraps up the problem into something quite solvable. Basically public games (free for all zoom style bots) and private games that pay rake to the lower level public games for verification incentive).\n\nImage: http://s30.postimg.org/jld2962n5/DPoker_Diagram.png\n\nBots cannot enter private games but would necessarily fill up the public tables (only) to the degree it is profitable for them to do so. Then there is a secure p2p network, incentivized by privately paid rake, that ANYONE can use to create their own "private" tables or "private" sites.\n\nTHIS is something bots cannot do, they cannot invite themselves to private games. But truly what you are effectively doing is breaking down completely the barrier to entry that is currently holding up the unfavorable monopolistic conditions we see today.\n\nThe kicker/killer here I believe both you will appreciate is I think that you can set the system up to pay the most to habitual LOSERS, and by paying them a sort of rakeback/stake in the network, they can either keep in to "mine"/verify games and make more "value", OR they can sell it to bot//node farms in exchange for money.

Peoples talk about poker dying, but really we haven\'t even begun to explore card games of hidden information in this regard.\n\nQuote:\nI\'m curious to why you have to make new accounts all the time.\nI\'m not sure I understand the question fully, I feel like i have something to offer the community, unfortunately others don\'t...I guess you\'ve decided I don\'t (certainly you\'ve called attention to me, where as I just try to be sincere and fit into the discussion, and offer any info I feel is valuable.).

Easy as follows:\n\n"If a decentralized game is more profitable than the current centralized model, then collusion is no longer an issue."': 1, 'One of the reasons peoples and computer scientists alike are so excited about bitcoin is its ability to solve exactly all of this. Bitcoin itself is basically a giant decentralized database in ledger form. The incorruptible block chain that it forms is much a p2p decentralized data base that in one sense perfectly addresses your concerns here.\n\nMoreover there are new solutions, that use the blockchain and are SPECIFICALLY designed for mass data storage. Szabo whom is well known for the mastermind and also for many related papers which includes explanations on new technology based on the block chain such as a data storage service has designed all this many years ago. Pokerereum\'s solution utilizes this.\n\nPart of the amazing aspects of this is that you CAN actually create algorithms through something called "smart contracts" (secure open source automated programming), that can search such data WITHOUT revealing to ANYONE anything that should be considered private. In today\'s model, sites like PS see your data and have access to it in exactly the way you are protesting.\n\nSo in short, using this p2p blockchain tech, we CAN actually have our cake and eat it too.\n\nWhat we really need to (and will) start to understand is a centralized contracted security service is a GIANT leak/cost from the player\'s perspective. Third parties are in fact themselves security leak holes, as we consistently find out.\n\nMoney doesn\'t come from thin air, but I understand where money comes from far better than you, whether it be of the paper/fiat kind or the cypto kind. What is suggested here is simple the addition of share of a decentralized network paid out to the losing players. The "value" that fuels all this is simple being siphoned from the current existing inefficiencies of the centralized status quo models. I have maths to show the value but its kinda useless without links.
