And since everybody is interested in better security, better interoperation and fewer bugs, they are interested in implementing new features (or reimplementing old ones) on top of this new approach.\n\nThe alternative is the old approach, like databases, APIs, etc. But nobody talks about this technology because it\'s well-known and not news-worthy.\n\nAs for why they are interested, banks fear that they will be disrupted by tech companies. (Cf. Uber.) And the blockchain is just the latest trend, so they give it a special attention. Business people are trying to anticipate future threats, thus pay a lot of attention to trends. You know, reacting to yesterday\'s threats is not a wise choice.\n\n> It seems right now everyone is scrambling to see what and how exactly it can be used.\n\nSo true. \n\nWell, it\'s not hard to imagine that it would be great if all banks shared some common system which would allow all transfers to be instantaneous and low-cost, and allowed all kinds of advanced features. Like, say, escrow. If you\'re buying something big, you want to use escrow. Something so simple becomes a problem with current banking systems, but tech-wise it should be trivial.\n\nSo this bigger goal is well-understood, but it\'s obvious it will take a lot of time to develop it and deploy it in practice.\n\nSo they\'re scrambling to find some smaller things which can be implemented and deployed right now, and which will put them on track to that worldwide, unified, all-capable system.

People like to say they understand the difference between \'censorship\' and \'moderation\', but I\'ve found it to be extremely subjective. People will not hesitate to censor something they dislike, in which case it\'s \'moderation\'... but if something they *do like* gets moderated, then it\'s considered \'censorship\' even if it\'s blatant trolling. \n\nThe BTC subreddit is learning this the hard way. Several people with a history of trolling this subreddit were modded, only to realize they needed to start moderating because things quickly got out of hand. Ironically, this crowd despises any form of moderation, but can\'t tolerate a completely unmoderated forum. Someone recently told me, "anarchy only works when people act in good faith" and I think there\'s truth to that. If you want an unmoderated forum, you\'re going to have to put up with the filth that comes with it. Most everyone agrees that some level of moderation is necessary, but due to the subjective nature described above, it\'s not possible to describe where that level is in black and white terms.

Nash (and Szabo for that matter) seem to remind us that our money systems are not just personal and individual but also function to serve relations between nations.  There are great purposes for this notably including how the bretton woods system was setup to prevent another world war.\n\nI don\'t think you exactly forget about it, but you just probably don\'t know Nash goes extensively into the game theoretical drama that might unfold between many of the different types of actors involved in money and governance. \n\nHe does also explicitly go into the benefits of gold but also where it fails.\n\nThe money market can\'t achieve stability because at certain times instability is favourable to different regimes and entities. \n\nNash\'s ultimate ideal money creates a standard of value which he suggest will erase the role of "grand pardoners", so really the concept needs to be unbreakable, and it will ultimately stabilize our global economy and end "crashes" in the massively unfavorable sense.\n\n>I won\'t pretend to know more than John Nash. . . but it seems to me that he arbitrarily places highest value on purchasing power stability.

One thing you might have thought or mentioned to that he suggests is that there is an effect on the cost of living in regards to say robots:\n\n>It is actually quite natural for the calculated "cost of living" to be rising, even when meas-ured, say, in terms of gold, whenever there is so much technological progress that the people in an area, without working harder, are lifted to a higher standard of living by the rapid progress, as if each human would become the beneficiary of the assistance of 3 robot helpers to do the work of his livelihood.\n\n But your points about the population only necessary hold true I think under a Keynesian system and not a nashian one.  Remember things like behavioural economics are what Nash revolutionized, and he talks a lot about the psychological of the citizenry especially in relation to a probabilistic future:\n\n>a process of political evolution might lead to the expectation on the part of citizens in the \xe2\x80\x9cgreat democracies\xe2\x80\x9d that they should be better situated to be able to understand whatever will be the monetary policies which, indeed, are typically of great importance to citizens who may have alternative options for where to place their \xe2\x80\x9csavings\xe2\x80\x9d.\n\nI think he rightfully paints a society that approaches the game of "savings" and "investing" quite differently.\n\n>Prices mean things and they coordinate the production and consumption and conservation of scarce resources.

Temporal factors have a coordinating effect on the economy, i.e. the time in which something is spent relative to when it is received means something and conveys important signals.  Bitcoin is not yet a fully actualized money.  Achieving that is something of a public good, or at least subject to free-rider problems (the creation of a monetary system is itself a non-rivalrous, non-excludable good. . . even if the units themselves are private or network goods).  The role of entrepreneurs as speculators here is key:  it is the taking on of the high risk that not enough other people will perceive of the future, much higher, value of bitcoin as a widely held and demanded commodity, which can then become the unit of account (the most saleable good).  And so, even the lottery-like nature and some of the get-rich-quick attitude bears out a sort of market wisdom, as they are a mechanism to overcome free-rider problems in producing the public good. \n\nWe could just simply have a government decree a money (quickly overcoming the public goods problem). . . but we already have lots of those.  If they work for you, great!  But it begs the question as to why you would be interested in bitcoin as simply a payment network.  Without achieving a certain critical mass (monetary status), the exchange price of a bitcoin is doomed to forever fluctuate wildly, and possibly diminish utility (most of us are not bothered by the volatility because we see it as part of the price discovery process towards something more actualized. . . not to mention the lottery mechanism I already mentioned.).  A decentralized crypto-ledger will never be able to keep up with the pace of development and speed and ease-of-use features of a centralized service; and even the censorship-resistant properties of bitcoin are minimal when on and off-ramps to fiat are necessary in order to give the network and token any utility.  When people earn bitcoin for their labor and trade it for goods and get it back. . . then you have an extremely useful and censorship-resistant currency. . . but more importantly; at that point, you have a unit-of-account money.\n\nSo, bitcoin as payment network alone is highly unlikely to persist, and falls far short of its potential.  Demand creates supply.  When consumers and merchants demand to hold the unit itself and account in the unit itself. . . then adoption occurs organically.\n\nYou might reconsider that there is an emergent wisdom in what you call fantasy, and the desire to profit from high-risk, high-reward speculation.': 14, '>You\'re telling me that my holding a painting (one of the classes of objects specifically mentioned) is the same as future spending.\n\nNo.  "holding" is a misnomer here, or at least is being used in a different way for what you\'re talking about with the painting.  What you are actually doing with that painting is consuming, or deriving direct utility from it. . .rather than deriving indirect utility or saving it (though of course it is possible to be "holding" the painting simultaneously in both ways).  Holding a painting in the way we hold bitcoin or gold or dollars might be more like Nazis squirreling art away in caves; they believed they would derive more utility from it by consuming or exchanging it in the future.  Commodities like bitcoin have relatively more use value as a vehicle for indirect exchange than they do for direct consumption or enjoyment (though it\'s possible that some people just love their precious and derive more satisfaction just staring at their bling or a pubkey all day).  So they tend to get used for indirect exchange. . . ultimately currency/money, if the market so chooses them as the most saleable good.  Besides, we had moved past the painting thing, and I think you know that, and anyhow this is all a distraction.  Let\'s get at the heart of what you said.\n\n>I have no idea why you are attributing this to me.\n\nBecause you said:\n\n>fantasists think they will all be billionaires once bitcoin displaces fiat and everyone is using to buy toothbrushes and potatoes. This will never happen, but bitcoin can be valuable nonetheless.\n\nYou\'re of course entitled to your own speculation about whether bitcoin will succeed in becoming a widely used currency such that a significant number of people buy everyday items with it primarily.  I have my doubts too!  But, as I gave reasons for in my previous comment, it doesn\'t make a lot of sense to hope for bitcoin to remain in its present state in perpetuity (that is to say, a passable store of value, a pretty good medium of exchange, and almost never-used unit of account) and yet not diminish in utility, especially relative to the myriads of other centralized payment solutions which will come online and much more immediately stable, government issued stores of value.  Why would anybody choose that?  I\'m not saying there\'s no reasons. . . but it certainly does give us a clue as to why so many bitcoiners are rabidly advocating for development to keep pace with the centralized services and focus on the number-of-transactions, and ease-of-use front.\n\n>I was supporting the proposition that bitcoin can be a store of value without being a ubiquitous means of payment.\n\nThat\'s great, and I don\'t mean to attack you too hard, but I think I just showed why what you said is somewhat contradictory, and I don\'t think that your very common insult. . . \n\n>The /r/bitcoin fantasists think they will all be billionaires once bitcoin displaces fiat and everyone is using to buy toothbrushes and potatoes. This will never happen\n\n. . . goes answered near enough.  Or at least not satisfactorily.  I think I gave good reasons why it\'s not quite fair to strawman bitcoin speculators (institutional or novice) as fantasists, or if not a strawman, then not fair to try to discredit those who may be get-rich-quick schemers as merely fools who are serving no possible future good.\n\n': 10, "It's been an excellent store of value for me, better than any other.

To disconnect the state from the issuance of money (at least to some extent) and to provide a market-based money for the entire world, which is native to the internet and not subject to the whims of another sovereignty than whatever one you happen to be trapped under.\n\nSince a bitcoin is virtual in nature (i.e. we cannot grab it with our hands and trade it via sneaker-net), then it is of course necessarily tied up with its own payment network or means of transfer.  But this was always secondary to its potential as store of value and money, and (while I don\'t believe there needs to be any blocksize cap at all eventually, ala Peter R.\'s work, and that even with LN or other payment layers bitcoin network itself will still eventually need to handle a lot more tps) this fixation on tps and immediate utility is kind of silly.  It will come.  Demand will create supply.  Organically.  Rather than the somewhat contrived merchant adoption wave that we saw. . . which failed largely because few of those merchants demanded bitcoin.  They simply satisfied a glut of misguided attempts to produce supply and expect commensurate demand.  Demand to hold will create supply of good development and useful outer layers of payment rails and contracting and other services. Demand to hold will create a supply of merchants and consumers who actually value the unit and account what they can obtain with it, in terms of BTC instead of $ or \xe2\x82\xac or \xc2\xa5  \n\nPeople must first demand to hold bitcoin, widely.  Merchant and consumer adoption will come along with that.  The role of the entrepreneur has always been to see the future as best as possible and take risks that pay dividends to them and to society if correct.  \n\nThis demand to hold will be based somewhat on its payment network utility, but will also need to be a reflection of a future-oriented evaluation of bitcoin\'s latent properties and potential as money.  That speculation is part of a market mechanism to overcome the public goods problem inherent to bootstrapping a new currency and monetary system onto an economic sphere (i.e. becoming the most saleable commodity).  \n\nThat is what is meant by "bootstrapping the currency".

Mining today is a for-profit exercise. Perhaps it won\'t be in 10 years. \n\nAltruism powers many important things in the world, but it seems pretty safe to predict a fee market roughly in line with costs.': 4, 'This I agree with. However, it\'s very basic economics that you can often make more money on a low margin business than a high margin business. Who makes more money, Ferrari or Toyota? Harrods or Walmart? \n\nTo assume "maximum fee per transaction = maximum fee revenue for miners" is an amateur mistake, and so see it repeated so often among Bitcoin luminaries speaks to a pervasive lack of economic understanding.': 3, 'So why is litecoin mining, with much smaller blocks, even more centralized than Bitcoin?\n\nhttps://www.litecoinpool.org/pools': 4, 'Informational content of this article is zero, or even negative, considering self-contradicting statements like "what\'s the incentive for me to do X, yet I do X in order to Y".\n\nToday I heard a much better question asked on Twitter[1]: "why shouldn\'t holders also bear the cost of maintaining the network, why only actual transaction-makers do?"\n\nAt first sight, the answer is obvious: because transactions are having all the costs. If no one transacts, there is nothing to sync with, nothing to mine (assuming mining reward is negligible), no overhead, no one has to pay.\n\nHowever, in reality, proof-of-work must always be increased in order to keep all balances respected[2]. So if you received some coins, you need a continuous flow of blocks on top of your unspent output to keep your coins safe from double-spending. Who is going to pay for that? Today that\'s every other transacting party, but not any of non-transacting holders (strictly speaking, holders provide liquidity which creates incentive to mine coins; but lets talk about mining reward approaching zero for the sake of discussion).\n\nIs it fair or not? Well, the answer is difficult to grasp intuitively, but the gist is: if holding Bitcoin2 costs something, then it\'s equivalent to eternal inflation in favor of the miners. This would make Bitcoin2 less attractive investment than Bitcoin1, which promises absolute sovereignty of your money for decades to come. Which means, people would prefer holding Bitcoin1 to Bitcoin2 and, as a result, transact more in Bitcoin1 (because that\'s what other people want to receive). The beautiful part is that anyone who wants to ensure X blocks to be built on top of their unspent outputs have 100% voluntary options:\n\n1. Mine these blocks themselves (like in 2009/10).\n2. Pay miners to produce difficult enough blocks in form of tx fees with "pay-to-self" transactions or even have direct deals.\n3. Pay miners with CLTV or CSV output (Peter Todd\'s idea, if i recall correctly). Imagine a transaction with one extra output with extra fees that gets spent only 100 blocks later. If it\'s CLTV, such output can be masked with P2SH so tx is not delayed unnecessarily (because CLTV is absolute and CSV is relative lock-time check).\n\nSo if the system will ever need subsidy from holders, that will be possible. But that will be voluntary, hence, your savings are 100% yours and you alone can decide how to sponsor the network, which makes Bitcoin the best money there is.\n\n[1] https://twitter.com/skfd/status/677351543360856064\n\n[2] http://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool/proof-that-proof-of-work-is-the-only-solution-to-the-byzantine-generals-problem/': 8, 'I have been Shreddited for privacy!': 1, "You don't think it can't be selfish to work on an open source project?
