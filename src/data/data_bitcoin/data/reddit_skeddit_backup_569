Just suggestions:\n\nFew things:\n\n1) The touchID logic is really weird.   It only asks for PIN (and not TouchID) when making transactions.  although filling out balance, clicking on lock brings me to touchID.     It\'s not really pointed out that tapping "breadwallet" initiates a touchID auth request either.  There should be just one TouchID prompt at the beginning of opening the app (like how bitWallet does it, or circle, or coinbase).   That way it\'s simple UX, and once authenticated, the user is able to go in and do whatever they want.\n\n2) are push notifications supposed to show when the app isn\'t in the foreground?   I can only see a pop-up in-app notification only when the app is in the foreground and loaded.\n\n3) the notification bubble could be shown longer (slower fade-out), higher up on the screen.\n\n4) push notification should also include a sound notification along with it.  Lots of people I know rely on this audible sound with the other wallets and android wallets during rapid merchant exchanges.\n\n5) would be great to have display in BTC, and not be forced to use bits.\n\n6) 24-Word BIP39 support!   If we rely on 256-bit private keys, why not 256-bits of seed entropy as well for a HD wallet.\n\n7) configurable fee\'s\n\n8) when entering in amount that exceeds wallet amount, automatically adjust accordingly (including adjusting the amount so that amount+fees=walletbalance\n\n9) adjust red/green "receive" and "send" widgets to resemble colored arrows.\n\n10) include full time in transaction log (as opposed to just the hour number after the date)\n\n11) ability to configure the app to automatically launch into camera scanning mode when launching the app (since a common use-case for mobile wallet apps is to open->immediately fill out info to SEND money)\n\n12) handling of bitcoin URI handlers across the OS.   I noticed AirBitz has taken over handling these on my system...is there any way to configure/over-ride?\n\n13) on my iPhone6, the app displays with the "enlarged"/low-res status bar across the top, usually reserved for apps that haven\'t been updated for i6/i6+ displays yet.   Is there a way to update it for these displays?\n\n14) add visual queues to "receive money:" and "send money:" such as arrows or icons\n\n15) get rid of address re-use prompt.  If I\'m using breadwallet, it\'s not ME that is using insecure practices of address re-use.  It\'s the person I\'m sending money too.   They should be warned about it, by whatever means, but useless to warn me.\n\n16) the decimal button on the keypad when entering amounts-- it looks like a comma.   \n\n17) About screen-- update to 2015.   And put a donation address in there too.   Take my money!   I want to support this.\n\n18) consider using green or blue coloring around the app.  It\'s been psychologically proven to make users feel more secure or that the app is more "professional" when it comes to money dealing apps. \n\nI get that most of my suggestions are subjective about UX, however, most bitcoin software suffers from the problem of engineers designing the UX/UI which doesn\'t really communicate well with the general population.

There are a lot of moving variables there: it depends on how competitive it gets to fund a particular loan and how well you've judged the risk for the loan.

There is no way to really estimate when a loan would be funded. I have a couple of solutions in mind:  \n\n* Get rid of the dutch auction style lending and go with risk-based pricing and lock all the lenders at the risk-based rate.  \n* Still use risk-based pricing and the dutch auction: if a lender chooses the risk-based rate, then their bid can't be bumped out by a lower offer.  \n\nThe second option seems a little better. Lenders that just want to earn interest on their BTC would automatically default to the risk-based rate, while lenders who want to compete would still be able to compete on the remaining amount. This will incentivize competitive lenders to get in as early as possible and keep their bids in, because if they cancel their bid somebody can come at the risk-based rate and lock them out of the loan.\nBest Regards,\nKiril Gantchev\nCEO of BitLendingClub": 2}, ('IRS Tax Rules For Bitcoin Miners and Investors, Headaches Everywhere!', 0): {}, ('Bitcoin Crime Wave Breaks Out in NYC', 3): {'Went the hell would you drive out to queens for the opportunity to be mugged?

The take-away for\ngovernments may be that they do have a responsibility to oversee and regulate the virtual currency\nmarketplace and that the time has arrived to engage the virtual currency community in serious\ndialogue to this end.\n\n**Recommendations**\n\n* Update the Financial Action Task Force for virtual currencies\n\n* Encourage the development of self-regulatory organizations [to balance stability and value against abuse by criminals]\n\n* Increase cross department exchange of information and expertise between money laundering and terrorism task forces in government\n\n* Where persons violate laws governing the use of virtual currencies, tax or regulatory violations may be an easier case to prove than to determine with certitude what specific funds were eventually used for\n\n* Maintain vigilance with regard to the evolution of virtual currencies \n\n**Conclusion**\n\n* Ignoring the problem, or not making the investment in time, training, staffing and technology to meet the problem, gives the criminals a real advantage, one that we cannot afford to give them and certainly, an  advantage that they do not deserve.': 0}, ('Make gambling interesting.', 1): {"It's a good idea and I think it'd be fun, but there are some issues regarding fairness.\n\nSay I'm running this game, and I see you bet a relatively large amount on some country to win.

We wanted to personally take some time to thank you for being part of this adventure as an early adopter. Here is our message :\n\nTL DR; Life got in the way and  we will not able to work on Woodwallets.io with the same level of passion and dedication we used to. Instead of just running it like a boring online shop, we decided to suspend operations. If you happen to know someone who can be interested in picking up the business and run it with passion, get in touch.\n\nHelp up by sharing the announcement link :http://woodwallets.io/goodbye-woodwallets/\n\nIt all started just for fun one year ago, with a reddit post titled \xe2\x80\x9cI have a lasercutter in my hands for a couple of months. Would you be interested in wooden paper wallets?\xe2\x80\x9d . The response was overwhelming.\nAfter a month of prototyping and setups, I sneaked into the World Mobile Congress to personally hand the first wallet to Jon Matonis, then president of the Bitcoin Foundation. And here were are, one year and several hundreds Woodwallets later, facing a hard decision.\n\nDuring Woodwallets\xe2\x80\x98s first and only year we have transformed a no-budget bizarre idea into a profitable business with a very solid reputation in the crypto-currency space. We always refused to get a \xe2\x80\x9cpaid review of your product\xe2\x80\x9d in the bitcoin press \xe2\x80\x93 and I assure there was no shortage of \xe2\x80\x9cspecial offers\xe2\x80\x9d in our inbox. Yet we have been able to reach the bitcoin community at large, building trustful relations with our loyal customers. I still get surprised when I show the product at local events/meetups to find out that a decent number of  people already knows it.\n\nBy putting energy and dedication in delivering a product for bitcoiners, we have been able to focus on what really matter : making the community happy with the product. The feedback we received from Woodwallets buyers can attest that we hit the target.\n\nBeside  being a an elegant piece of design, Woodwallets also helped in raising awareness about cryptocurrency in general and cold storage practices. A good ice-breaker for face2face introduction to cryptos, it also allowed for the creation of open source BIP38 encryption tools like bippy, pushing a bit over the boundary of bitcoin security and infrastructure.\n\nHowever, it is now time for us to move on. Life sometimes gets in the way, and we  realized we won\xe2\x80\x99t have enough time for running Woodwallets with the same level of dedication that brought us where we are now. We can\xe2\x80\x99t afford anymore to spend nights soldering thousands of free bitcoin keychain rings for a conference by hand. We won\xe2\x80\x99t be able anymore to experiment with new materials, research into new products, play with multisig, be active on social networks, promptly respond to emails and follow the altcoin scene while keeping keep up with this extremely fast-paced space.\nNot being able to invest time in such activities will make Woodwallets just an ordinary, average and boring business. And we do not want to upset the (almost) one thousand amazing twitter followers and fans. Instead, we took the decision to stop taking new orders, with immediate effect.\n\nWe would be more than happy to leave everything we built so far in the hands of a company or an individual who is capable of running it with the same level of passion -possibly even more \xe2\x80\x93 that we kept during this year. If you think you are that person, or you know someone who might be the one, please get in touch or help us by spreading this message\n\nAnd no, we will not conclude this message with a Bitcoin address begging for donations. Never did. Just two simple words, in the name of all the people who at some point collaborated in this project : thank you.\n\nWhatever happens now, we will keep a good memory :)\n\n\nSincerely, \nNico & Rebecca >>': 7}, ('Will this hurt or help bitcoin?', 2): {}, ('I want to send BTC to an address without a Coinbase knowing.
