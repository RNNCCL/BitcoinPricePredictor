That\'s what he has done with his proof: he has created abstract concepts inside a theoretical new type of mathematics ("[anabelian geometry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anabelian_geometry)") that the article [I linked to](http://www.bostonglobe.com/ideas/2012/11/03/abc-proof-too-tough-even-for-mathematicians/o9bja4kwPuXhDeDb2Ana2K/story.html) claims only 50 people in the entire world are able to even come close to understanding, and even they are having trouble with it. Why? If you scroll down to part B in that article, you can read about how Mochizuki then invented something he calls "Inter-Universal Geometry", and wrote the bulk of the proof in that concept. And I really need to stress here that Inter-Universal Geometry is his concept. No one had seen it, heard of it or anything before he published his paper. He made up a brand new mathematical tool, and just expects others to use it without an instructional manual to explain what the heck it even is. Its now less "He\'s a genius we are all ignoring" and more "He\'s a genius who put out a proof only he can understand", because that is literally what is going on. He put out a 4 part, 500+ page proof using concepts he made up, and so far only he can understand. And that\'s why you couldn\'t have skimmed it.\n\nFurthermore, maybe this is why Satoshi walked away from Bitcoin. Because he did his thing, put it out there, and saw the community degrade itself [time](http://www.buttcoinfoundation.org/business-owner-sounds-off-about-bitcoin-missionaries-trying-to-convert-him-the-flock-does-not-take-well-to-dissenting-opinions) after [time](http://www.buttcoinfoundation.org/your-obligatory-butterfly-labs-case-update) after [time](http://www.buttcoinfoundation.org/blake-benthall-and-the-terrible-horrible-no-good-very-bad-day) again.

Being open helps people globally innovate more rapidly. Closed platforms stifle innovation.\n\n(2) Decentralization: There is no central authority that controls what happens, so Bitcoin cannot be shut down, just like the Internet cannot be shut down. If the Internet is shut down, due to depletion of energy, then the world no longer has to worry about Bitcoin. The implementation of decentralization is through Peer to Peer (P2P) technology.\n\n(3) Trust: Money depends on trust, without which money cannot have meaning or hold value. When trust is ensured, then exchange of funds can happen. The way Bitcoin ensures trust is by implementing a mining system called "Proof of Work" (PoW). Arguably, the exponential increase of computing (hashing) power over time helps to secure the network. Though it seems like it could never work, the existence of the network after 5 years is evidence that the method works and it seems to be a valid solution to the Byzantine General\'s Problem.\n\nThere is more to bitcoin than the currency, but to get started with bitcoin, you must first create a wallet, and either: join an exchange and convert fiat currency to bitcoin, or: request to be paid for your work in bitcoin.': 1, "[Coinmap.org](http://coinmap.org) is a good map of physical locations that accept them.

It's not an IOU. Rather it is a type of derivative known as a CFD (contract for difference) and it is backed by BTS, in the same way that paper gold futures are backed by USD rather than physical gold.\n\nThe way bitGOLD is created is that two parties enter into a smart contract with one person going short gold (going long BTS), and another going long gold.\n\nThe shorter gets the ability to gain leveraged exposure to BTS, and has to post 200% collateral in BTS, in addition to the 100% paid by the person going long gold, for a total of 300% of the value of bitGOLD held as locked colleteral in BTS. It is this locked collateral that backs bitGOLD tokens.\n\nThe person going long gold gains a fungible token, bitgold, that can always be exchanged to an amount very near to the value of gold in BTS. This is because the bitGOLD shorters are forced to cover, or reup collateral within 30 days. In practice this means that they have a token that behaves just like bitcoin, but has its price locked to gold.\n\nThere are many different bitassets in addition to bitGOLD, such as bitUSD (the biggest bitasset). You can see how the peg holds here: http://coinmarketcap.com/assets/bitusd/ (there are sometimes glitches in how the price is shown on CMC, but it usually swings in value within 0.99 - 1.01 USD)\n\nthe bitCNY peg holds even better, with Btc38.com recently starting to accept bitCNY as if it was CNY, i.e. if you send them 8000 bitCNY they will credit you with 8000 CNY. So for bitCNY the peg is exactly 1:1.\n\nThe huge advantage this could mean for crypto in the future is that it means businesses won't have to instantly dump their bitcoins for fiat in order to hedge. If they are paid in bitassets they can stay in crypto until they actually need to buy something else with it, and can cash out at that time. The only risk with bitUSD, bitGOLD or bitCNY is the systemic risk of a black swan event doing a margin squeeze. In order to compensate for this systemic risk, and to pay for the ability of shorters to leverage their BTS exposure, all bitassets pay yield, an interest that is calculated and paid out every time you move your bitasset balance.

When a buyer and short seller take positions on each side of the CFD to create bitGOLD on the internal BTS market, a margin order is created. Margin orders have call prices, representing the price of BTS / bitGOLD that will automatically trigger a margin call, covering the short. Covering destroys the bitGOLD and unlocks the position, releasing the collateral. The call price is initially set at the price by which 75% of the collateral would be required to buy back the bitGOLD, but you can add more collateral to your position if you want. 5% of the remaining collateral is kept as network fees.': 1, 'Bitshares solves this with BitUSD and bitGOLD that are fully pegged to USD/gold and work completely without counterparty risk, since they are CFD smart contracts collateralized by 300% of their value locked in BTS (the base token of the bitshares blockchain).\n\nThere is still systemic risk associated with a black swan crash of the collateral that happens too fast for margin calls to execute (this would require a 66% price fall within minutes), but the traditional centralized counterparty risk that is typically associated with other pegging systems, such as bitreserve, does not exist. In essence they function completely as bitcoin without the volatility.': 3, 'All bets (i.e. smart contracts) are collateralized with between 150% - 300% of their value in locked BTS. So the market cap of bitshares always has to be at least that much higher than the combined value of all contracts. In case a contract falls below its margin requirement it is automatically margin called by the blockchain.': 3, "Almost. You can't have fixed value, but you can have stable value. There are currently two platforms for stable value cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe first, and the one I prefer, is Bitshares. It's a currency and platform for creating BitAssets that are linked to the value of anything with a market price, like dollars, yuan, gold or oil. BitUSD, for instance, has a stable value because of the way it's created and destroyed.\n\nIt's created by people who are betting that the Bitshares currency will increase in value versus dollars in the next thirty days. The speculator effectively makes a short trade on margin by putting up collateral of $2 worth of Bitshares to create $1 of BitUSD. That 1 BitUSD is purchased for the equivalent amount of Bitshares (let's say that's 100 Bitshares, for example), then the BitUSD is released into the economy for trade. Now there's 300 Bitshares of collateral worth three times the value of a dollar locked on the blockchain. If the value of Bitshares drops too much, the blockchain forces the speculator to buy a BitUSD with the locked collateral, which destroys the BitUSD and results in a loss for the speculator\xe2\x80\x94she'll pay 120 Bitshares for a BitUSD and only have 180 left instead of the 200 she put in. If the value of Bitshares goes up, the speculator can realize her gains by buying a BitUSD, destroying it, and keeping the remaining collateral\xe2\x80\x94she'll pay 80 Bitshares for a BitUSD and have 220 left, more than the 200 she put in. These trades result in [a crypto-USD with a stable value](http://coinmarketcap.com/assets/bitusd/). Anyone who wants stable value puts in $1 of Bitshares and gets $1 of Bitshares out, backed by the speculators and Bitshares' open source, auditable algorithm. It's so stable that BTC38, a Chinese cryptocurrency exchange, [will accept BitCNY and add regular yuan to your balance](https://bitsharestalk.org/index.php?topic=12203.0).\n\nThe second is NuBits. I'm less of an expert on NuBits, but it's effectively a central bank on a blockchain, controlled by people who own NuShares. The money supply is controlled by interest rates and the issuance of new currency. If a NuBit is worth more than a dollar, NuShares holders can create more NuBits to adjust the price down. If a NuBit is worth less than a dollar, NuShares holders will pay interest on NuBits deposits to take them out of circulation. Interest rates go down when the price reaches parity again.

Gox, and do the best you can to make the best of a bad situation.": 2, "this is probably because you're a simpleton who thinks that if the price is high, bitcoin is unstoppable and the price is low, bitcoin is dying. when neither of those is representative of where bitcoin is going.": 9, "I'd say the one bitcoin was created.": 1, 'Ever heard of miners?\nAs strong a hand as they might have, most of them *have* to sell some of their newly minted coins to pay to keep the rest.': 2, '"If all goes according to plan".

I said it is falling...that is the problem. If it stabilzed here for the next years, would be much better for everyone than it dropping more and more and more and discouraging new investment. The miners just keep on minting BTC and dumping and price keeps dropping.\n\nthank you for proving my point.': 2, ">  I would say it most definitely increased, but by less than 11.5%\n\nDisagree. Coinbase had 700k wallets on Jan 1st. Today it's roughly 1.9 million. Blockchain.info went from 900k to 2.6m. And those are just two companies. Since Jan 1st we saw Circle launch, as well as mobile wallets for iOS, and a whole host of other (new entrants) solid and professional parties in the wallet market that have reported growth like Armory and Mycelium.\n\nYes, you can say that X of those wallets are double wallets instead of new users. But that's not a new phenomenon, so it's not relevant to a percentage based question. (i.e. if on Jan 1st 50% of the 700k wallets at Blockchain.info were doubles, and there were only 350k users, and 1 year later they grew to 2.8m and 50% were doubles with only 1.4m users, it's still a 4x growth in users.)\n\nSo we've seen wallets increase by 100% to 200%, and if we assume (reasonable) similar percentages of double wallets, then even if we are skeptical, it's very likely that users did indeed outpace the 11.5% growth in bitcoin. Which correlates with a lot of the investments we've seen, as well as things like reddit users growing fast.\n\nWhat I do think though is that each bitcoiner is on average holding less bitcoin than before. Let's not forget at the beginning of 2013 the price was around $10. There was a huge rally of 100x. There were probably some big holders of bitcoin at the time. Few but large amounts. Mining wasn't as competitive, buying thousands of bitcoin was possible throughout early 2013. Then the price crashed right after a huge media hype that brought in loads of new entrants who soaked up big guys selling off their $10 bitcoin at $500 prices. So it definitely seems that a few large holders of bitcoin sold small numbers to a large amount of new owners throughout all of 2014. So, more users, more owners of bitcoin, but smaller amounts on average.\n\nAs for the comment you're quoting, isn't the 'purging of weak hands' in reference to players like Mt. Gox? That sounds quite sensible to me. There are a lot of things I don't know and can't predict, but I don't feel smug in saying that I and many others with me pretty much predicted Mt. Gox to happen someday. There were too many red flags, too many indicators, too many problems, too large a price differential, too many fuckups in the past, too little professional communication to inspire trust that it wouldn't massively fail. So it was definitely a weak hand and it sucked but it was going to happen, better sooner than later, and bitcoin survived quite well despite a historically massively important part of the ecosystem vanished overnight.

Before that, up to World War I, inflation was zero or close to it. Prices sometimes rose or fell sharply for a period of several years or even decades, but these price movements generally balanced out in the end. This was the case in all countries for which we possess long-run price series. \n\nMore precisely, if we look at average price increases over the periods 1700\xe2\x80\x931820 and 1820\xe2\x80\x931913, we find that inflation was insignificant in France, Britain, the United States, and Germany: at most 0.2\xe2\x80\x930.3 percent per year. We even find periods of slightly negative price movements: for example, Britain and the United States in the nineteenth century ( \xe2\x88\x92 0.2 percent per year if we average the two cases between 1820 and 1913).\n\n[...]\n\nThe gold value of the franc set in 1803 was not officially changed until June 25, 1928, when a new monetary law was adopted. In fact, the Banque de France had been relieved of the obligation to exchange its notes for gold or silver since August 1914, so that the \xe2\x80\x9cfranc-or\xe2\x80\x9d had already become a \xe2\x80\x9cpaper franc\xe2\x80\x9d and remained such until the monetary stabilization of 1926\xe2\x80\x931928. Nevertheless, the same parity with metal remained in effect from 1726 to 1914\xe2\x80\x94a not insignificant period of time.\n\nWe find the same degree of monetary stability in the British pound sterling. Despite slight adjustments, the conversion rate between French and British currencies remained quite stable for two centuries: the pound sterling continued to be worth 20\xe2\x80\x9325 livres tournois or francs germinal from the eighteenth century until 1914. 28 For British novelists of the time, the pound sterling and its strange offspring, such as shillings and guineas, seemed as solid as marble, just as the livre tournois and franc-or did to French novelists. 29 Each of these units seemed to measure quantities that did not vary with time, thus laying down markers that bestowed an aura of eternity on monetary magnitudes and a kind of permanence to social distinctions. \n\nThe same was true in other countries: the only major changes concerned the definition of new units of currency or the creation of new currencies, such as the US dollar in 1775 and the gold mark in 1873. But once the parities with metal were set, nothing changed: in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, everyone knew that a pound sterling was worth about 5 dollars, 20 marks, and 25 francs.

It is a common criticism made against the viability of Bitcoin. The \xe2\x80\x98deflationary spiral\xe2\x80\x99 is a real condition that affects the popular fractional reserve backing system. Bitcoin is not affected by this because it is fundamentally different from popular currency.\n\n>Deflation is a decline in the general price level. Deflation occurs when the price of goods and services, relative to a specific measure, decline. It is not necessarily that the value of the goods and services themselves declined, but can be because the value of the currency itself increased.\n\n>For example, let us consider an economy comprised entirely of beef and oranges where the medium of exchange is gold. Both beef and oranges can decay and are not consistent, and therefore cannot be used as a currency. In order to trade, people exchange gold for either beef or oranges. They see gold as a store of value that they can use to purchase beef or oranges in the future. What happens when the economy grows and we can produce more beef and more oranges? The price of both beef and oranges will decline. To the extent our productive capacity for both beef and oranges increased at the same pace, the exchange value between the two (the amount of beef for a given number of oranges) will likely stay the same; however, those who held gold as a store of value would now be able to purchase more beef and more oranges for a given amount of gold.\n\n>A deflationary spiral occurs when the value of a currency, relative to the goods in an economy, increases continually as a result of hoarding. As the value of the currency relative to the goods in the economy increase, people have the incentive to hoard the currency, because by merely holding it, they hope to be able to purchase more goods for less money in the future. A lack of currency available in the market causes the price of goods to further decrease, resulting in more hoarding.\n\n>In our economy of beef and oranges it is easy to see how this could occur. First, people see a significant gain in productivity on the horizon; we will be able to produce more beef and oranges for the same effort in the future. The supply of gold, however, is fixed. As a result, people desire to hold gold, because they will be able to purchase more beef and oranges with their gold in the future than they can now. This will lead to a decline in the price of beef and oranges as measured by gold (an increase in the value of gold). Limiting the amount of currency in the market available for exchange can also make transactions more difficult. In a complex system where we do not only have beef, oranges and gold, this can result in a deflationary spiral where no one wishes to spend their currency and the economy itself slows as a result of the limited number of transactions. Limited demand with fixed output results in a decline in prices, which further exacerbates the problem.\n\n>Alternative explanation: A deflationary spiral occurs when the price of a traded article increases at some given rate, which causes people to hoard it. As people hoard the commodity, less and less of it is available thus causing the price to go up even more. In turn, even more people hoard the commodity. Thus a feedback loop or spiral of deflation occurs.\n\n>In practice, there is only a limited amount of 'value' that can be placed upon a good before it becomes too attractive to trade for other goods (thus ending the spiral). The only time that the 'Deflationary Spiral' can happen (to it's conclusion) is when people can foresee a time where they are forced to use that particular traded article. See below for a dissenting argument on this topic.\n": 1, 'So the OP is saying that switching to a deflationary economy would cause the housing market to go in the toilet, to which your response is that house prices would drop significantly without widely-available credit.

It's just a question of how it gets there (whether it be gradual with minor recessions or violent with full blown collapses). I frankly think housing prices are overvalued partially because of the interest tax deduction and also because they are used as a store of value against inflation. If a fixed supply currency helps make it less appealing to pump up these housing prices then that's probably a good thing. \n\nBut let's talk about the pros of fixed supply currency for a second. **If you are working in the US, every year your salary has to increase by ~2-3% in order for you to be earning the same amount in real terms to account for inflation**. So in order for you to stay at the same level, you have to get a raise every single year, and in order for it to be a *real* raise it has to be more than this. \n\n**With a fixed supply currency, if you get a raise, it's a real god damn raise**.  So you don't have to fight for a raise to stay at the same level, it's going to happen anyways. \n\nInflation also represents another form of tax beyond income, sales, property, death, etc. etc. taxes because it's the government that spends that money into existence. So not only are you not needing to get a raise every year to just stay afloat, you're also paying less in taxes. \n\nIf a solid currency helps to stem the massive rise of credit usage, then to me that's a good thing.

So they invest most of it, in order to get on average a 4% return on investment. With a deflationary currency it becomes less expensive to keep a part of your capital as money. A sustainable growth rate for a developed economy is about 1%. Which would mean a deflation rate of 1%. It means that storing capital as money won\'t cost you 6% (4% of missed ROI and 2% inflation), but only 3% (4% of missed ROI, compensated by 1% deflation).

There are quotes around the word stored because that\'s not actually what they store. What they hold is called a private key. The way it works is that when you wish to send a transaction, you need to sign it with your private key. Anyone who knows your public key (which is part of your address in most cases) can decrypt that message. This is called asymmetric (or more commonly public-key) encryption.\n\nBitcoin (big B) handles all of the various transfers in two ways. First, it propagates transaction requests throughout the network, first verifying that they meet certain conditions (ie, the requesting address *had* the money, the private key was valid, etc). Second, specific clients (called miners) will attempt to include these transactions in the blockchain, in a large package called a block (hence blockchain).\n\nThe way they do this is relatively complicated, but the shortest way to explain it is that they are given a function to perform on that block and a given number.
