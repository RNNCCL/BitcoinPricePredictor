If you go by stereotype, it\'s narcissistic libertarians who see themselves as visionaries punished for their daring individuality by a tyrannical government whose raison d\'\xc3\xaatre is to stamp out personal freedom wherever it can because, uh, for the heck of it, I guess. Nicholas Mross confirms the clich\xc3\xa9 in The Rise and Rise of Bitcoin, a circle-jerk for bitcoin zealots who speak primarily in self-deluded Silicon Valley PR drivel. Mross\'s brother Dan is described by his wife as "chang[ing] the world and mak[ing] it better" because he hosts a bitcoin server in his basement. "It\'s the smartest people in the room that are the most excited about this," declare the Winklevoss twins, who just happen to own 1 percent of all bitcoins.\n\nThe doc divides the world into two kinds of people: the prophets and the rubes. At a New Hampshire convention, Dan sips from his coffee, smacks his lips, and sighs, "Tastes much better when bought with bitcoins." Alternating between talking-head interviews and animated PowerPoint presentations, Rise and Rise does offer fascinating details when it suspends its relentless cheerleading to chronicle the online currency\'s mysterious origins, sensational growth, and troubling ancillary industries (e.g., money laundering, gambling, drug sales, theft of bitcoins). Though the Mross brothers cop to the currency\'s checkered history, the film never offers a serious exploration of bitcoiners\' na\xc3\xafvet\xc3\xa9 or regulation-phobia. Thus, rather than the currency itself, the film\'s most compelling subject ends up being the separatist psychology of its self-regarding fanatics.

(This is how people make so-called \'vanity addresses\' for themselves, like "1Ross5Np5doy4ajF9iGXzgKaC2Q3Pwwxv" which says \'Ross\'). With each new character that must be matched, it becomes exponentially more difficult.\n\nInterestingly enough, the [address generation work](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Technical_background_of_Bitcoin_addresses) is similar to bitcoin mining in a way, because they both make use of cryptographic hashes. In fact, one step in address creation is the same algorithm (SHA256) as mining.\n\nHowever, you actually cannot use ASICs to compute new addresses, because bitcoin ASICs can only do SHA256, and address creation requires additional algos. A good GPU cluster however, could I think be used to create addresses rapidly.\n\nGiven a nice rig and a little bit of time, 5 characters matching is not hard. But due to the exponential nature of difficulty to match a longer pattern, I think if you get to the 8-9 range, then it would be impractical. \n\nMaybe someone who knows how to calculate about how long 5, 8, and 9 would take on an average GPU rig can chime in?': 3, "I just finished watching the documentary, good job.

Anyone can see the price of stocks on the global markets and publish them in a price feed as an oracle. With enough oracles with reputation, perhaps with assistance from OpenBazaar's identity and trust system, reliable data on outside markets can be obtained for use in smart contracts. With a betting market like Counterparty enables, every piece of outside data is a handle that lets you influence how that data moves. With stock share data, this enables synthetic shares of stock to be traded, which means anyone can gain exposure to any stock in the world. Not only that, but they can also influence its value on the centralized stock exchanges. \n\nFor example, say Amazon shares are trading at $100 on NASDAQ. This data is republished on cryptographic feeds signed by various oracles in a form that can be imported directly into smart contract payouts. On the betting market you can then create a bet that the price of Amazon will be higher tomorrow at 10:00 EST, or even a sliding bet that pays out more the higher the price is over $100 at that time, with a set of oracles specified for grabbing the actual NASDAQ price at that time. \n\nThen you can go long on Amazon by betting the price will rise, or go short by taking the other side of the bet. The really cool thing is that, once the decentralized betting market is large enough, the position of the betting market (longs vs. shorts) actually pushes the Amazone stock price up or down on the NASDAQ as well, because of arbitrage. That is, anyone who operates in both markets can make money if there are any disparities between the betting market's synthetic NASDAQ:Amazon price and the actual Amazon price on the NASDAQ exchange, bidding the prices closer and closer together. If the prices are far apart, the arbitrage profit is huge, so many people will do this, secretly of course. Since the betting market can be used anonymously just like Bitcoin, no one can know who the arbitrageurs are.

Except\xe2\x80\xa6 consider the overriding motives of a venture capital industry no longer prepared to benevolently support the no-earnings business models they love to fund \xe2\x80\x94 more often than not focused on communication, attention, brain-washing, reactance and manufacturing-consent type endeavours \xe2\x80\x94 because they\xe2\x80\x99re burning through their cashpiles at rates that they can\xe2\x80\x99t even stomach.\n\nIf only there was a way, you know, for mom and pop to burn their cash supporting the industries that like to lobotomise their children directly?\n\nBut how to convince the older generation to freely hand over money to the sort of businesses their kids love to love, but can\xe2\x80\x99t pay for, but which go against the very interests of any parent focused on developing a well rounded individual fit for critical analysis and engagement in the real world? How do you convince parents, after all, to pay for their children to be indoctrinated and plugged into the compliance matrix? Turn the whole thing into an investment proposition, of course.\n\nHere\xe2\x80\x99s Byrne evangelising about a future where Wall Street becomes utterly decentralised and unsupervised, to the extent that everyone can take themselves to market at zero cost.\n\nCode-named \xe2\x80\x9cMedici,\xe2\x80\x9d the project aims to democratize Wall Street in much the same way bitcoin seeks to democratize currency and payments. By operating separate from traditional stock exchanges and the big corporate banks, it could eliminate certain loopholes in the system and reduce the costs associated with issuing and juggling stock.\n\nAside from the fact that the codename \xe2\x80\x98Medici\xe2\x80\x98 is pretty telling in and of itself (surely the Medici didn\xe2\x80\x99t end up becoming a multi-generational elite? \xe2\x80\x93 Ed), it\xe2\x80\x99s the scant discussion over the fact that listings rules exist for a reason.\n\nLet\xe2\x80\x99s not even mention the fact that the little amount of decentralisation we\xe2\x80\x99ve had thus far (we\xe2\x80\x99ve had quite a lot, no \xe2\x80\x93 ed?) led to a massive wising up of the supposedly informed money management industry about how decentralisation doesn\xe2\x80\x99t serve their interests at all.\n\nIn fact, wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the whole HFT fiasco based on the buyside finally realising the extent to which decentralisation had allowed ruthless predators with access to superior information to ruthlessly exploit them? Wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the response \xe2\x80\x9cwe need more centralisation not less!\xe2\x80\x9d?\n\nSo with the buyside wising up in this way, is it any surprise a new source of dumb money needs to be found for ventures that make no economic sense, but do encourage subservient tendencies to the new information overlords, needs to be identified pronto?\n\nLet\xe2\x80\x99s now look at how Marc Andreessen \xe2\x80\x94 the man who thinks monetising every facet of journalism will improve it on the integrity front \xe2\x80\x94 plans to upend the old world of finance.\n\nFrom an exclusive interview with Bloomberg markets magazine:\n\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x98The startups chasing disruptive technology aren\xe2\x80\x99t working within the existing system. This is the cryptocurrency phenomenon. If it works, we can re-implement the entire financial system as a distributed system as opposed to a centralized system. We can reinvent the entire thing.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x98Bitcoin is clearly in this category. With bitcoin, there are advantages to decentralizing the financial system in order to do commerce. For instance, you can make payments in all but four countries. So, on day one, you can use it all over the world. Forget about all the different currencies and banking systems; it\xe2\x80\x99s a truly universal way to transfer value.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x98That also means we have the chance to radically lower fees. Most consumer transactions are weighted with a 3 percent fee; remittances run up to 10 percent, which I think is a moral crime. There\xe2\x80\x99s a big opportunity to take those fees out.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99\n\nBold claims, you might think, from a man talking his book and being interviewed by a company that is \xe2\x80\xa6\n\nTo sum up the article\xe2\x80\x99s points briefly, without the spin:\n\nRegulating the banks means that the bad practices they were able to get away with can now be transferred to non-banks, among them tech companies.\n\nSoftware people don\xe2\x80\x99t need to meet people in the flesh to make wild presumptions about their behaviours, because to them they\xe2\x80\x99re all deterministic agents without freewill anyway.\n\nQuantitative tools can help those who fate has called upon to be society\xe2\x80\x99s overlords to more easily stamp out free-will across the rest economy, thanks to the magic of making people think their choices are real when really they are not. Yes, they\xe2\x80\x99ll all be gamed and redirected where needed before they even step out of bed.\n\nYou\xe2\x80\x99ll be credit rated not on your track-record to date, but your Minority Report-esque future track-record which is apparently already pre-determined. We like to call it Judgment Day.\n\nA distributed system is better not because it splits the masses up and thus stops them from organising against the overlords, but rather because it extends the divine obligation of make payments to the chosen few to everyone universally.\n\nBitcoin is brilliant because it transfers the cost of segregating an ever greater wealth pool in society to users directly. What\xe2\x80\x99s even better is they don\xe2\x80\x99t realise they\xe2\x80\x99re paying for it by giving up their right to self-determination!\n\nA financial system that can maintain the rigid hierarchy of yesteryear by persuading the masses to pay for that classification with the cunning use of myth-making propaganda is so much cheaper than having to police it on a soul-to-soul basis.\n\nBitcoin is a battle between the light or the dark side. If it works, we will all serve the new capital elite of Silicon Valley, and they presumably will dutifully serve the pseudonymous Sataoshi Nakomoto forever. On both fronts it\xe2\x80\x99s subservience to masked and unknown entities.\n\nOur investments are dualistic. The pay-offs will either be infinity-to-one or zero-to-one. It\xe2\x80\x99s the zero theorem test for society. If zero equals something, it can\xe2\x80\x99t equal nought. If it equals nought it can\xe2\x80\x99t equal something. Something out of nothing is not possible. But since it is with Bitcoin, which means we\xe2\x80\x99ve figured out the meaning of life! Life is all about being a servant to someone more powerful than you!\n\nWe needed to develop a cult to create the system, because otherwise it would never have been sanctioned by reasonable society.\n\nWho needs to trust people or society. All you need is belief in ethereal mathematics and technology that has arrived from Mars and which can uphold the deals you do with the ethereal masked entities for all eternity in the blockchain. There\xe2\x80\x99s no way out once your fate is sealed.\n\nLast and not least\xe2\x80\xa6\n\nAndreessen says that the reason computer scientists are so excited about Bitcoin is because no-one has as yet figured out what\xe2\x80\x99s wrong with it. Every problem, you see, has been anticipated by the great \xe2\x80\x9cdesigner\xe2\x80\x9d. Or as he puts it: \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the magic of why everyone out here is so excited about it\xe2\x80\x9d.\n\nWhich, we guess, is fair enough if you think a perfect system features mass wealth concentration, a rigid hierarchal system that depends on persuasion and subjugation of the masses, no-one ever forgetting anything you do, no-one ever being able to change their mind either, wasteful energy destruction, and for the majority of of us, having to spend more of our lives navigating through incredibly hot data centres preparing to be forked at anytime.\n\nNo voodoo or cultic ritual here. No God complex either. And certainly no \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99re either with us or against us\xe2\x80\x9d talk or \xe2\x80\x94 oh by the way, didn\xe2\x80\x99t you know this was just a giant Beta test for eternity in the Cloud?\n\nThe funny thing is we don\xe2\x80\x99t actually disagree with Andreessen that the old banking model is dying \xe2\x80\x94 note our Death of Banking series. We just think there\xe2\x80\x99s a difference between suggesting banks are becoming irrelevant because steady returns on capital can no longer be achieved without foreknowledge and/or manipulation of behaviour patterns with skilful public brainwashing, and killing off banks and replacing them in the top spot because you\xe2\x80\x99re better at manipulating behaviour patterns with skilful public brainwashing than they are.\n\nFull disclosure: This author is working on a book about the financial system\xe2\x80\x99s increasing dependence on cult markets for preserving value and hierarchy in an increasingly abundant system.

The fact that we are not capable of breaking the speed of light makes every sentient being valuable as someone who is in the best position to make decisions as to how to interact with the nearest surrounding environment. In simple terms, when an event occurs somewhere, no one can observe and understand it quicker and react better than the person who is closest to it (and watching for it).

The fact that they can't send and receive information instantly means that everything they learn and order takes an amount of time (the speed of light giving a theoretical minimum) to propagate. When an event occurs somewhere away from the central entity anyone who is closer to that event can react first and get a better outcome at whatever it is. If someone has an idea as to how the central entity would react, that's even better because it creates an arbitrage opportunity, which means that that someone will be able to gain at the expense of a central entity. Such a central entity would love it if people were deluded into believing that it is basically omnipresent and omniscient and thus were deterred to act in their own self interest. Arbitrageurs, on the other hand, love it when a central entity deludes *itself* that it is omnipresent or omniscient and acts as if it was.
