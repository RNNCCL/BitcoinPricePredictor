I believe this is one of the most important aspects of decentralized cryptocurrencies. On the other hand, their deflationary nature makes them very dangerous. \n\nOne of the problems of deflation we are encountering with bitcoin right now is instability. From the [Wikipedia article on inflation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation#Positive):\n\n>Economist S.C. Tsaing noted that once substantial deflation is expected, two important effects will appear; both a result of money holding substituting for lending as a vehicle for saving.[48] The first was that continually falling prices and the resulting incentive to hoard money will cause instability resulting from the likely increasing fear, while money hoards grow in value, that the value of those hoards are at risk, as people realize that a movement to trade those money hoards for real goods and assets will quickly drive those prices up. Any movement to spend those hoards "once started would become a tremendous avalanche, which could rampage for a long time before it would spend itself."[49] Thus, a regime of long-term deflation is likely to be interrupted by periodic spikes of rapid inflation and consequent real economic disruptions. Moderate and stable inflation would avoid such a seesawing of price movements.\n\nWe\'re going to see this scenario play out over and over again with bitcoin. It\'s really bad for an economy and I bitcoin bitcoin is going to fail to be the world reserve currency because of it. Another problem with bitcoin is that no government is going to use bitcoin. It\'s going to create its own currency and create demand for it by requiring taxes be paid in this currency and by spending this currency.

Thank you for your interest in our product. We recently launched at DEMO 2014 in San Jose and people have expressed visible enthusiasm for what we\'re doing.\n\nIn a nutshell we\'re trying to make escrow cheaper, faster and easier, building atop the security of the Bitcoin multi-signature system and releasing funds (USD or bitcoin) automatically upon a package being delivered via shipping provider APIs. \n\nAs of now, anyone worldwide can use our product as a "stand-alone" application on our website, pavilion.io. Soon we will offer the product only as a plugin on  e-commerce sites like Ebay, Amazon and Alibaba to secure purchases on those platforms.  \n\nWe encourage people to use the stand-alone version to get the word out about our simple automatic escrow release function for sale of goods. Its free (other than a pass-through credit card fee for USD payments), easy-to-use and requires no login. Great for all exchange transactions in particular with sellers that are unknown!

Buyer or Seller initiates transaction via simple form on pavilion.io, chooses whether exchange involves USD or BTC payment, and chooses whether funds are released upon package sent or delivered.\n\n2. Email to each party auto-generated instructing buyer where to send funds and seller where to ship goods.  \n\n3.  Buyer sends bitcoin or USD to escrow. \n\n4. Escrow released upon shipping provider API confirming shipment or, as the case may be, delivery. \n\n5. If shipment/delivery is not confirmed by shipping provider API in 14 days, funds revert to buyer automatically using NLocktime function in Bitcoin protocol.  \n\n\n\n\nHow is Trustless Exchange different than other escrow sites for exchange of money for goods transactions?\n\nPavilion uses advanced blockchain technology including P2SH 2-of-3 multisignature escrow release transactions and smart wallets to enable automatic escrow release in accordance with predetermined inputs of exchange parties.  For simplicity, our funds tracker displays at all times location of funds via feed from Bitcoin blockchain.  To automate USD payments, we use Stripe and a token representation of the escrow sent to a smart wallet that we call a Satoshi Token. ': 1, 'Looks really great thank you.': 1, 'Looks interesting.
