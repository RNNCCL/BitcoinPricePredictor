No one\'s coins are actually threatened (short of those transacted roughly during the 51% attack), so it would just be a matter of fixing the problem and hard forking the network or rebooting it using a different mining algorithm. All of this, of course, would drive the price down dramatically.

So doesn't this mean that some bitcoin miners could see the sidechain proof as invalid, and others think it's valid?  Wouldn't that mean that we could have a consensus fork in the main network?

Straight up charity is a one time event and often only has a linear return, keeping it going even when you deliver can be hard (I also have experience with charities, too-, and extensively with free software projects). Diversity in funding mechanisms for  infrastructure is important, plus, the interest and funding was available.\n\nIf all you\'re going for is "be rich if bitcoin is wildly successful" the best guess achieving that is just owning bitcoins (which the Blockstream founders/staff all does too).

You need to be careful about which plugins you use that may open up security exploits.  Sometimes PHP is seen as micky mouse stuff but given Facebook was originally written with it I\'d not dismiss it either.  For a newbie, PHP is probably the best place to start.\n\n* NodeJS - This is awesome because it allows websockets (2 way push/pull communication between web browser and server where as most are just pull data systems).  NodeJS is used for blockchain.info and other popular sites so has shown it can be fit for purpose.  The downside is firstly it\'s harder to grasp than PHP, everything is asynchronous, harder to debug and typically takes more code to do the same thing that can be done in PHP.  It also doesn\'t have type casting so you can do really scary shit like "010" == 16 I believe so you need to be very careful with security on it.\n\n\n* Java - This is more dedicated server stuff, it\'s pretty good but you\'ll be writing a lot more code than you would in PHP and have to handle a lot of fringe cases.  Memory manangment is also a consideration but as long as you know what you\'re doing it\'s pretty darn good!\n\n* C/C++ - This is more for working on the bitcoin reference client or an incredibly purpose build server where you have a lot of experience with the above technologies (or were a C/C++ programmer before).  It takes longest to write with, open to causing server crashes because you control memory allocation and makes maintenance costly as people who code this demand higher salaries and will take 10x longer to write what a Node or PHP developer could do.  If however you need speed or low level control or absolute memory handling C is the best route.\n\nPersonally I keep C/C++ for game development or embedded systems, I wouldn\'t touch it for bitcoin servers as you\'re opening yourself up to costly development as you need to grow.\n\n* C# - It\'s good for average standard game development, game logic or making tools in windows.\n\n* Python is useful for tests and some server work, I\'ve not done much with python other than simple scripts so probably shouldn\'t comment on it.  The idea writing a server in Python does seem odd to me but wouldn\'t be surprised if people had done this.\n\n\nTL/DR: I\'d recommend for server development PHP to begin with, NodeJS if you\'re serious, Java if you\'ve got some cash and C++ if you\'re a financial institution.

Anyone collecting GST needs to have 75k annual business turnover, register for GST and submit quarterly business activity statements. \n\n\n>Anyway, if the ATO is going to be like that for buying btc for cash, then they should be willing to give you credits for when you sell them, too, getting back the gst from your own purchase price when you sell them in tiny increments. This isn\'t actually a big deal for businesses that are already used to charging/claiming gst, but it will make it more difficult for the general populace.\n\nGST is a consumer tax and the ATO are treating bitcoins like a consumer good, even though they admit Bitcoin is not a goods. ATO have already said that business to business Bitcoin transactions will be entitled to claim GST credits back.

Here are the relevant answers:\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCoinffeine is a company, a startup business model, which we're not. Bitsquare is a non-profit, supposed to be from the community for the community. We take decentralization seriously, our main focus is to avoid single points of failure.\n\nCoinffeine are essentially paid by investors, like in their first funding round by the spanish bank bankinter: http://blog.coinffeine.com/2014/11/17/the-spanish-bank-bankinter-invests-in-coinffeine/\nAs you can see in their blog http://blog.coinffeine.com/ they are on the look for more vc capital in NYC. In fact Coinffeine considers banks as clients:\nhttps://letstalkbitcoin.com/blog/post/bitcoins-and-gravy-49-coinffeine-the-distributed-bitcoin-exchange\n\nThat wouldn't be acceptable for Bitsquare.\n\nBitsquare will hopefully be paid for by the community that it's aimed at. We actually made a start by working and paying for v0.1, including fuctional public software.\n\nLast time I checked, Coinffeine didn't do public testing. (they do closed testing, I'm not sure if that has changed yet)\n\nCoinffeine uses micro-payment channels to mitigate risk of fraud, whereas our protection system is a combination of security deposits and a decentralized arbitration system: https://bitsquare.io/bitsquare.pdf\n\nCoinffein will use OKPay as fiat payment processor. Bitsquare will support most if not all 'hard' payment methods https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Payment_methods\n\n\nI made this post to answer your question, to show the differences there are even if they use the same terminology like we do. I, by no means, want to discredit Coinffeine. \n\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\nThe main concern I see with Coinffeine is that they use that micropayment on the Fiat side, that means you have a high number of small fiat payments between 2 accounts of the same payment processor. \nThat is a pattern which even the dumbest monitoring system will be able to track and so the payment processor or bank will know exactly that those 2 account holders are involved in a BTC exchange. \nWho else make hundreds of 1 EUR payents in 1 minute?\n\nSo the Single point of failure test will fail as you are dependent on that payment processor/bank to support bitcoin and you lose your privacy. \nFurthermore it is limited to OKPay so both traders need an account there. They plan to add more paymnet options/banks, but I cannot image that there will be a big variety (they need an open banking API which is normally not available beside a few modern payment processors). Also I think it will not be possible between different banks due the cost structure of the micropayments. Micropayments can be cheap inside one bank as its only an internal database entry change, but as soon you leave the bank you have higher costs and delays.\n\nIt is an exchange model built for banks to letting them take part in the bitcoin exchange business without getting involved directly with Bitcoin (see interview with CEO: https://letstalkbitcoin.com/blog/post/bitcoins-and-gravy-49-coinffeine-the-distributed-bitcoin-exchange). \nIts an interesting business model for banks but has nothing to do with the idea of decentralisation.\n\nIt is good to have additional exchange models like Coinffeine but as I said it is not decentralized. \nI see it similar to those attempts to include an exchange into the banking account like some banks have tried it (and got closed again after regulatory pressure). http://www.dagensia.eu is one example for such...": 4}, ('Bitcoin Giveaways on Twitter: Follow for Bits', 0): {'[**@BitcoinGive**](https://twitter.com/BitcoinGive):\n>[2015-02-04 12:41:52 UTC](https://twitter.com/BitcoinGive/status/562954190188982273)\n\n>[#BitcoinGiveaway](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23BitcoinGiveaway):\n>[#Follow](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23Follow) [@BitcoinGive](https://twitter.com/BitcoinGive) &amp; [#Retweet](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23Retweet) this\n>\n>first 10 will get 200 bits each!! 100 bits for Next 10 via [#Changetip](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23Changetip)\n>[#Bitcoin](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23Bitcoin)\n\n----\n\n[^[Mistake?]](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=TweetPoster&subject=Error%20Report&message=http://reddit.com/2uqzjw%0A%0APlease leave above link unaltered.)\n[^[Suggestion]](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=TweetPoster&subject=Suggestion)\n[^[FAQ]](http://np.reddit.com/r/TweetPoster/comments/13relk/)\n[^[Code]](https://github.com/buttscicles/TweetPoster)\n[^[Issues]](https://github.com/buttscicles/TweetPoster/issues)\n': 1, "Is it bad that even 200 bits doesn't seem worth the hassle of signing into Twitter for me?

Yes I'm mostly aware of the general details.\n\nI'm curious to see if there's someway to re-purpose all that brute force mining (essentially a super-computer's quantity of effort).\n\nMaybe we can send small amounts of bitcoin from specific addresses to each other in a form that a problem that the process of hashing orders, or maybe something with mapping like I mentioned above.\n\nIn analogy think back when people still used log tables and looked up answers like that, yes you could compute them but it was tiresome, instead one person computed them, and printed (saved) the results.

I\'ll just tell you how it works instead. :)\n\nA miner creates a block with a number of transactions in it and then calculates a double SHA-256 hash of the block header. That hash value is a 256 bit number. That number has to be less than a specified value (difficulty). If the hash fails that test, the miner tweaks a number in the block header (called the nonce - a "number used only once") and then calculates the hash again, again, again, etc until the hash passes the test.\n\nThis is a brute force function. Due to the preimage resistance of SHA-256, there is no faster way to find a hash that will pass the difficulty test. \n\nVerifying that the hash is correct is very cheap though. All you would have to do is hash the block header and do the test, since the tweaked number is already in there. \n\nThe brute force part is very expensive to do, which is intentional. This ties into other aspects of the design, not really visible in bitcoin\'s code, but more into the game theory aspect of it. An attacker out for profit would earn more money contributing work to the network (and earning bitcoin) than to try and do a double spend attempt, which would yield a far lower reward for a much higher risk.
