Soft-forks, since they are more restrictive on the set of rules, do not threaten that set of hard rules we call Bitcoin.\n\nAlways assume that an hard-fork attempt, no matter the team, is an attack to the current Bitcoin software; do not evaluate the proposed changes by trusting the majority or the minority since they are easily gameable (e.g. censorship, sockpuppetry, Sibyl attacks); remember that any hard-fork obliterates all the cumulative security you can indirectly evaluate by looking on how the old set of hard-rules fared so far under an adversary environment. \n\nBitcoin must resist itself and its successors, or it could fall to the centralization charade: the idea of regular scheduled hard forks is incredible dumb, since it will obviously lead to developer centralization.

We have enjoyed unprecedented growth in technology for decades, there is no guarantee it will continue growing. A soft fork could be introduced at a future point in time, but in my opinion, ideally we want to build this ship and set it a-sail.

The subsidy giver can announce something like a 5 BTC subsidy that will be sent to the coinbase address(es) for new blocks that do not have this Bitcoin Classic support in the blocks' script signature.   Sure, this is an expensive subsidy but 5 BTC/block might be enough to persuade enough miners over and keep Bitcoin Classic from activating for some period of time.  When the Bitcoin Classic support level drops to a level farther away from activating (e.g., 60% or less), the giver can withdraw further promise of a subsidy.\n\nOf course, this can be gamed by the miners (to increase their revenues), so it's not a perfect tool.\n\nAnother defensive mechanism would be to deploy many nodes that will not relay the blocks marked with Bitcoin Classic support.

An important development in this process has been the emergence of virtual currencies (VCs). VC schemes are private sector systems that, in many cases, facilitate peer-to-peer exchange bypassing traditional central clearinghouses. VCs and their associated technologies (notably distributed ledgers based on blockchains) are rapidly evolving, and the future landscape is difficult to predict.\n\n>**VCs offer many potential benefits, including greater speed and efficiency in making payments and transfers\xe2\x80\x94particularly across borders\xe2\x80\x93\xe2\x80\x93and ultimately promoting financial inclusion. The distributed ledger technology underlying some VC schemes\xe2\x80\x94an innovative decentralized means of keeping track of transactions in a large network\xe2\x80\x93\xe2\x80\x93offers potential benefits that go far beyond VCs themselves.**\n\n>**At the same time, VCs pose considerable risks as potential vehicles for money laundering, terrorist financing, tax evasion and fraud. While risks to the conduct of monetary policy seem less likely to arise at this stage given the very small scale of VCs, risks to financial stability may eventually emerge as the new technologies become more widely used.**\n\n>**The development of effective regulatory responses to VCs is still at an early stage.** VCs are **difficult to regulate as they cut across the responsibilities of different agencies at the national level**, and operate on a global scale. Many are opaque and operate outside of the conventional financial system, making it difficult to monitor their operations.\n\n>Regulators have begun to address these challenges, with a variety of approaches across countries. Responses have included clarifying the applicability of existing legislation to VCs, issuing warnings to consumers, imposing licensing requirements on certain VC market participants, prohibiting financial institutions from dealing in VCs, completely banning the use of VCs, and prosecuting violators. These approaches represent an initial policy response to the challenges that VCs pose, but further development is needed. In particular, national authorities will need to calibrate regulation in a manner that appropriately addresses the risks without stifling innovation.\n\n>More could be done at the international level to facilitate the process of developing and refining policies at the national level. International bodies are playing an important role in identifying and discussing the risks posed by VCs and possible regulatory responses, and they should continue to do so. **As experience is gained, international standards and best practices could be considered to provide guidance on the most appropriate regulatory responses in different fields, thereby promoting harmonization across jurisdictions.** \n\n>Such standards could also set out frameworks for cross-country cooperation and coordination in areas such as information sharing and the investigation and prosecution of cross-border offenses.\n\nTL;DR: They get it, Bitcoin is cool, but think about the children please.

There are two distinct limits that you are confusing. The first is the rate at which new coins are issued, that is on a  fixed unchangeable algorithm and will eventually result in a maximum of 21 million coins being issue (in about 150 years). The second limit is more a software design limit known as the 'block size'. Because a new block is created about every 10 minutes, then the block size determines how many transactions the network can store in those 10 minutes. The current 1MB block size is rapidly reaching the point where it is not big enough to contain the amount of transactions being posted every 10 minutes (Because transaction volume is increasing). So the debate and delay has largely been around the different ways of increasing the transaction throughput, some of which have been to increase the block size. There are some parties with vested interests in keeping the block size as is which would create a competitive market for transactions to get into the available 1MB. The way that would work is by people bidding with higher transaction fee's, and the miners effectively only processing the highest payers!  \nNow most sane people realise that would be shooting bitcoin in the foot as large amounts of transactions would never get processed.

Instead of a media outlet breathlessly repeating assurances from a banking sector executive that the first blockchain based virtual currency is dead, the source of the obituary was none other than Mike Hearn, a leading Bitcoin developer.\n\nHearn\xe2\x80\x99s post on Medium exposed some of the inner workings of the Bitcoin industry, focusing in particular on the deadlock among developers regarding how to increase the maximum number of transactions per second. Hearn deserves to be heard, given the time he has devoted to making Bitcoin work, but many of his concerns have been blown out of proportion.\n\nThe majority of the article discusses an issue that has been in hot debate since the middle of 2015, the scalability of the Bitcoin\xe2\x80\x99s underlying ledger mechanism, the blockchain.  Bitcoin currently has the ability to handle between 3 and 7 transactions a second due to a mix of the current 1mb limit per entry to the blockchain, called a block, combined with the current methods of uploading the transactions. As it turns out, the number of Bitcoin transactions are growing at such a rate, that we, as an industry, needed to start thinking about scalability as early as last year.\n\nHearn\xe2\x80\x99s proposed solution is a new version of the Bitcoin protocol, called BitcoinXT. There were many changes, but most importantly the block size was expanded by a factor of eight. Other developers feared that the increased block size would make it harder for smaller miners, industry players who validate transactions in exchange for the ability to create Bitcoin and receive transaction fees, to participate. The consolidation of miners would lead to centralization, removing much of the security and efficiency attributed to Bitcoin.\n\nThe other concern was the transition from Bitcoin to Bitcoin XT. The proposed modification would be added to the official software immediately, but would not activate until 75% of all clients running the Bitcoin protocol, called a node, were upgraded. The nodes that did not upgrade would continue running, but with a separate view of the state of the Bitcoin blockchain.\nRecommended by Forbes\n\nThis separation is conceptually similar to the dreaded \xe2\x80\x98hard fork\xe2\x80\x99, a situation where there are two different versions of a blockchain. During a hard fork, many of the checks and balances that keep Bitcoin running falter until the industry decides which blockchain is the most legitimate. The theory is that since BitcoinXT would be an intentional, in place upgrade of the existing system, announced well in advance, there shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be any question as to which version of the blockchain is correct.\n\nWhile an important voice, Hearn is not the only one and there are other solutions being tested. Bitcoin Classic, another scheme to expand the Bitcoin block size, is supported by over 50% of all the miners (something which Hearn mentioned was blocking the increase of the blocksize), as well as big players like blockchain.info, Bitstamp, and Xapo. Developers have also been developing new scaling technologies that neither increase the blocksize nor risk a hard fork, such as Segregated Witness and the Lightning Network. There is more than one method for Bitcoin to make it over this transaction volume hurdle.\n\nHearn spent months trying to shepherd Bitcoin XT through the internal development process. When it became clear this was not going to happen, he left Bitcoin for R3, an organization that is building tools for banks with non-Bitcoin based blockchains. Several months after joining R3, Mike released his post on the failure of Bitcoin, highlighting lack of scalability.\n\nHearn\xe2\x80\x99s post posits an end to Bitcoin, the latest and certainly most interesting among the nearly hundred predictions of its demise. His frustration even after months of no longer working directly with the development team comes shining through. As bad as his assessment sounds, the future is a bit more benign.\n\nLast year, it was announced that over $1bn had been invested in various Bitcoin oriented operations. This is a pool of entities that have both talent and financial resources. While many are chewing over Hearn\xe2\x80\x99s missive, this group is having internal discussions about what to do next. Despite a perceived scalability problem, for which fixes are being developed, these companies are growing fast, with new technologies like Bitcoin debit cards and better ways to pay international contractors.\n\nHearn\xe2\x80\x99s post has already been added to the Bitcoin obituary list, but when we look back on this event it will look more like he applied the defibrillator paddles to the Bitcoin protocol development team.\n\nSo how does this affect entrepreneurs in the industry? For us, it was all about managing fear, uncertainty and doubt. You see, after Hearn published his post, concerned parties started reaching out from various aspects of our business, from investors and partners to even entrepreneurial friends in our personal lives. To those reaching out from outside the industry, it seemed that an impending doom was upon us.  After several conversations, one by one, we managed to reassure our stakeholders that everything was fine.\n\nWill this be the last time we will have to deal with this sort of industry doubt?  The previous 90 declared deaths to Bitcoin point to a resounding no. Luckily, $1bn in startup investment, a fast growing industry, and a group of core developers dedicated to scaling Bitcoin means that companies like ours are here to stay.': 18, 'Jonathan Chester - Founder/President at Bitwage ': 4, 'If ad content hadn\'t become fucking obnoxious (in some cases interfering with the content I\'m trying to fucking look at...

This makes it a vastly better store of excess productivity, and along with its built in payment, settlement, and record-keeping systems a vastly better overall money.

It isn\'t a "store" of value so much as an honest signal of excess productivity either in the past (savings) or in the future (debt - someone found future-you credible enough to let now-you use their money). But it isn\'t a "store", because it isn\'t like a water tank where if you store one liter, you can later withdraw exactly one liter. With money one can only claim what is available.

When you incur a debt you are borrowing someone else\'s excess productivity - whether you borrow an actual good or you borrow that excess productivity stored in the form of money.  What happens when the bank just creates the money and there wasn\'t actually any productivity that took place with its creation?  Answer: you are "borrowing" a little bit of the excess productivity of all others who have saved it using that particular money (without their consent) - most people call that stealing.  But in reality since most people don\'t actually know how their banking system works, it\'s the banks who are doing the stealing. \n\n2.

Periods of expansion and contraction happen in cycles in my opinion. Boom periods are due to a very rapid rise debt, and then busts follow when deleveraging takes place on a large scale. This is what is happening in China most spectacularly, but the whole world is overleveraged. Martin Armstrong calculated that the business cycle takes place around every 8.6 years. 8.6 years ago was the beginning of the 2007-2008 crisis. \n\nHowever in this case the first world is already exhausted from trying to combat the impact of the 2008 crisis and central banks have used up all their traditional means of combating a crisis. We stretched the rubber band as far as it can go, it can't stretch much further, so if there is another crisis it is not clear whether its impact can be mitigated. \n\nFurthermore, the emerging markets and China supported the rest of the world in coming out of the last crisis, but this crisis, if it is a crisis, is actually being led by those countries, which means that the entire world will be enveloped by it and no one will be able to help. \n\n> Lets say it does happen, what will happen to the price bitcoin? \n\nMy guess is that under such circumstances Bitcoin is poised to do quite well. Because it is a new and developing market that's use case is directly related to challenging and improving the existing financial system, should the legacy system fall into chaos it is only natural that many would look twice at bitcoin. Because bitcoin is so small, if only a tiny fraction of capital seeks shelter in it the price could rise dramatically, and under such circumstances, when people see that it is one of the few assets in the green they will likely pile on, creating an even greater increase in price. This will, in turn, spark a huge amount of interest and media focus which will reinforce its growth. \n\nFurthermore, in countries where the value of their currency is rapidly depreciating, and in countries where bail-ins and negative interest rates make banking more of a liability, the currency becomes more attractive. If a decentralized market place like *open bazaar* is available and used, people will be able to buy anything they need using bitcoin, creating an ecosystem precisely when the traditional economy is in chaos. This will cause people to want to actually hold onto bitcoin, and merchants who accept it may very well decide to keep it rather than convert it into their native currency, particularly if the price is rising for the other reasons I gave. This means bitcoin starts to actually be used as a money, and that's when it really comes into its own. I only hope Bitcoin, with its current scalability issues, can handle this kind of growth.  \n\n> Will there be mass world adoption of bitcoin as governments seek for a universal means of exchange? Will you be able to pay for your food with bitcoin?\n\nIn places where Bitcoin is legal you will be able to pay for your food with it. But as bitcoin becomes more successful, many governments will likely outlaw it. However, this will mostly likely only happen *after* bitcoin has become successful beyond people's expectations.\n\nAs far as governments recognizing it as a global currency, this is a much longer term horizon and depends on how everything else plays out. Most likely many governments will be hostile to Bitcoin long before they embrace it. \n\n> What if the dollar becomes worthless (because of hyperinflation), how will this impact bitcoin? \n\nBitcoin, like precious metals, would obviously benefit from this. If the dollar is rapidly becoming worthless, people would desperately try to preserve their wealth by exiting the banking system and bitcoin would be there to embrace them. Notice that this is the main scenario most gold bugs are expecting. I don't personally see this happening. \n\nThe good thing for bitcoin, however, is that unlike gold, it doesn't require massive inflation of fiat currency to do well, for all the reasons I have given. Its success is not simply in tied to its value as a currency, but also its value as a system that offers potential innovative solutions to the problems the traditional financial world is facing in the digital age. If the financial system is in danger, block chain technology will be taken very very seriously, including Bitcoin. If Bitcoin is embraced by parts of the financial system due to its open, permission-less nature -- an advantage it holds over other, private, block chains being explored by various companies -- many governments could become less hostile. \n\nGold and silver, on the other hand, offer no technological solutions, they are merely hedges against inflation. Bitcoin would do well in a situation of hyperinflation of the national currency, but its success doesn't depend on it. \n \n> Is there any scenario in which bitcoins price can go to (almost) zero?\n\nYes, there are many. Broadly speaking if there is a technological disaster with bitcoin it could quickly go to zero. There is the threat that is playing out right now with the block size debate that if bitcoin were to split in two confidence in the system could rapidly erode. And there is the threat that governments might declare all out war against bitcoin -- although they could have a similar effect on the price of bitcoin as the war on drugs had on drugs. Finally, there is the threat that a competing digital currency -- one issued and sanctioned by the banking system, for example, or simply one that proves itself more effective for various reasons -- could strip bitcoin of any advantages it currently hold and make it obsolete. There are reasons to think that none of these threats are probably, but they are all possible.

Every 3 months (six difficult adjustments), Core will change (via hard fork) it\xe2\x80\x99s PoW algorithm. There will be one month (4032 blocks) of overlap after each change, in which blocks created by both PoWs will be accepted. This will give enough time for upgrade after each PoW change. Every PoW change will reset the clock on any ASIC-ization effort. It will be madness to try to create a matching ASIC, when the PoW is changing every 4 months (1 month for the grace period).\n\nThis will completely eliminate the current situation in which two companies (BitmainTech and BitFury) can control over 90% of the hash-rate.\n\nThe mining playing field will be leveled again and the barrier of entry for mining will lowered. Everyone with money and access to low cost electricity will be able to mine. There will be no need to buy 16nm ASICs from BitFury at $13 per unit, when BitFury cost is $3 per ASIC (my estimation).\n\nIn order to avoid corruption in the selection of PoW algorithms, I also suggest that a committee of 5 individuals will be formed, with each individual serving a term of four algorithm changes (one year), with staggered cycles so the committee is not changed all at once. The preference will be to use complex algorithms, with multiple sub algorithms (e.g. X11 style), and the constants in each should be selected randomly from the block-chain data leading up to each rotation. As this is merely a suggestion for community consideration, I do not presume to define selection criteria for the committee members.\n\nWhat about BotNets ?\n\nBack in 2012 it was a real issues.
