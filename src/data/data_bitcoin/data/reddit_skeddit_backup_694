I see a diverse ecosystem forming with bitcoin at it's core, and altcoins filling various niches around it.  With diversity comes resilience and stability.  Multiple block-chains means no single point of failure, and further decentralization.  Radical innovation can happen at the fringes, and good ideas can move to the center.  \n\nThe same logic applies that drives retailers to build several competing big box stores in the same area.  Even though they are in competition, they know that their combined draw will bring in more people from farther away.  Each store benefits from that by gaining more business than they lose to the competitors.  Altcoins support bitcoin cooperatively in this way, by offering different options and appealing to different demographics.

Governments only suck off of the real producers like parasites and hinder the free market from providing society\'s needs.  Government has an interest in surpressing your needs, because as long as they keep you in need, it gives them a reason to pretend to exist.  You think government solves problems, so you will give them more money and power to solve problems that they create.  This incentivizes them to create even more problems, then when things are worse you will give them even more money and power, and its a vicious cycle.\n\nBitcoin doesn\'t require permission, so it allows us to bypass the government\'s restrictions on the free market.  This allows more freedom, wealth and prosperity.  Soon light bulbs will be illegal along with increasingly more things.  You won\'t be able to buy and sell them on ebay.  But on openbazaar, you can buy and sell anything for Bitcoin without permission.\n\nRedistribution of wealth is a horrible idea, unless it is the free market that is redistributing it naturally.  Right now we have a lot of corporations and monopolies/oligopolies who stole their wealth through government scams.  They captured regulators through a process known as "regulatory capture", and that is where their wealth comes from.  Central banks are printing the money out of thin air distributing it not to you or the common man, but to corrupt bankers and monopoly men.

For an individual there will always be a layer of doubt no matter what law is passed.\n2.  It is important to understand what technological advantage it has, not what philosophical advantage it has. It promotes economic growth by making small frictionless payments possible, and reducing fees. Also, since it is only controlled by math, as long as the private key is kept safe, it has potential upsides to people under government scrutiny, be it blackmarket, or simply someone persecuted by government. In the first-world it is not as big a problem, some places in the world, they will just seize your account for disagreeing with a politician for instance. \n3. Going forward, since Bitcoin has a monetary value based in FIAT currencies, it will likely carry the same distribution, as the amount owned is that amount bought in. This does not of course count all of the early adopters who are already greatly benifiting. However, enabling micropayments, and potential options for the unbanked, could redistribute wealth to some of the poorest people in the world. It's more of an enabler to those without means to have banking. It also can help some regions in the world, where currency is more volatile than Bitcoin.

This means installing packages on Gentoo takes longer, but the packages can be built with compiler optimizations for your exact hardware, and you can choose the set of build options that you want.': 1, 'I don\'t see luke-jr\'s actions as a problem for Bitcoin. Gentoo/Bitcoin users are a small subsection of node operators so this doesn\'t have a huge impact on the network.\n\nI see these actions as a problem for Gentoo. This is a growing trend - package maintainers creating custom USE flags and deploying non-vanilla software packages to users who unwittingly use the altered software, THINKING it\'s the vanilla source when it\'s not. A small text warning in 8pt gray-on-black doesn\'t really let the user know that "hey, you\'re getting an altered version of this software" especially when it\'s a part of hundreds of pages of such messages (typical during updates and installations).\n\nBitcoin is just one example of package maintainer abuse in Gentoo; it just happens to be a very controversial one because Gentoo users running the "default" bitcoin client will be (possibly unknowingly) blacklisting certain addresses from their mempool - not at the discretion of the user running the node, but at the discretion of the package maintainer. This is giving the package maintainer (luke-jr) artificial and inappropriate control over user nodes. Whether the nonstandard behavior is "optional" or not is irrelevant; it breaks the philosophy of Gentoo to enable nonstandard behavior by default in a package.': 2, "It's not really a huge problem, but it is an issue. It's basically one douche with the ability to include certain things in the software he helps maintain. He made the executive decision that certain transactions should not be propagated by nodes, and has made the bitcoin client reject these transactions by default.\n\nThis goes against the neutrality of bitcoin. who decides what constitutes 'spam' and what is a worthy transaction? Where do we draw the line?": 6, 'Oh, its an OS?': 1, "If that's the case, then why enable the blacklisting by default? If the nature of bitcoin is to let people make their own choice to reach a majority consensus among the group, then simply provide them the means to do so.": 4, 'If we can sit around bitching about a single OS, that means other problems are at present minute, which is awesome for a newb like me.': 3, "Yeah, sure you can do whatever you want in the software you develop. luke-jr didn't develop gentoo though, he's just a maintainer. So he may have made contributions in part, but he has no right to include those type of ideological things as if the whole thing is solely his creation.": 2, 'I have noticed this, (Sorry I did not word the question well) my question is *what* type of software is gentoo (If its mining/Wallet I can see this as a huge ass concern)': 1, "This does not go against the neutrality of bitcoin, this is _exactly_ what bitcoin is about.\n\nIf a node does not like a transaction, it should refuse it.  If you disagree, that is fine.  The majority (or at least a substantial percentage) of nodes is enough to sway the network.\n\nThe hope is, that if X node is bad for the network, it will also be unpopular.  There are many cases in history where that is NOT the case.  We'll see if that becomes the ruin of bitcoin.": 0, 'yup.': 1, "Because I took the time to develop 'my node' and I convinced you to run it (somehow).  Since I believe something, I want to then make it hard for you to not execute my belief.\n\nIn other words, if you feel that strongly, pick another node to run.\n\n[Edit]: also, go to reddit (or wherever) and make a case for your opposing belief to convince others.": -1, 'its gentoo linux': 2, 'Thank you.': 1, 'Gentoo is a Linux distro; just another type of linux some people prefer to run. Examples of other distros are Fedora, Arch, Debian(like Ubuntu), [etc.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_distribution#Examples)': 2, "yeah, I also hadn't heard about it until now... it's obviously no biggie. If this is the worst new currently, I'd say this is good for Bitcoin ;P": 2}}}
