But the price is not rising above 380$.  Therefore Tim Draper is not buying bitcoins at 380$. Therefore he does not think they are worth more than 380$.\n\nNow consider the auction.  If he does not feel like buying 1000 bitcoins at 380$,  why would he want to buy 50'000 bitcoins at 390$?\n\nThe same applies to everyone who, like Tim Draper, has some money to invest. The fact that the market price is 380$ means that all those people think that bitcoin is not worth 390$.": 1, "If Tim Draper (or anyone else with money) thought that bitcoins were worth more than 370$, he would keep buying them at the exchanges, or anywhere else he could find them, until the price rose to the value he has for them.  Said another way, anyone with money to spare thinks that bitcoins are worth 370$ or less.\n\nSo why would they buy for 380$ something that they don't buy for 370$?": 0, 'Why would anyone bid above market value?\n\nPeople bid under in the last one, too.

Merchant doesn\'t send anything? Chargeback (for CC)/dispute (paypal). Merchant sends a broken product? Chargeback/dispute. I\'m an asshole and decide I don\'t like the product for no reason? Chargeback/dispute. I\'m an asshole and decide that this merchant is getting scammed today? Chargeback/dispute.\n\neBay, Paypal, apparently Amazon, and other platform providers don\'t hesitate to screw the merchant for a number of reasons: \n\n - Each product is typically offered by several merchants. Driving away some merchants does not significantly hurt the platform. Avoiding a merchant that doesn\'t have the payment method the customer wants usually does not significantly hurt the customer.\n - Customers are provided additional protection by such platforms (since scammy merchants don\'t last long and the platform usually sides with the customer), and platforms are convenient because the customers already have accounts, and they are thus inclined to use them. Adding good customer protection makes this even stronger, making the next point worse:\n - Merchants basically *have to* use a platform if they want to be noticed (for eBay/Amazon) or if they want to find customers who want to deal with them (PayPal), giving them little recourse.\n\nExcept for wanting to support Bitcoin, there is really not much of a reason for a customer to choose to use Bitcoin over Paypal or credit cards. \n\nIf merchants started aggressively offering *noticeable* discounts for paying with Bitcoin, this could change. However, any discount below 5% probably won\'t move a lot of users unless we\'re talking about expensive products. A discount of 5% or more is more expensive than just paying the damn extortion fee to Paypal or the credit card company. Also, because PayPal and CC companies are not dumb, but very greedy, they have clauses in their contracts that may make this illegal (sometimes depends on jurisdiction, sometimes depends on how it\'s implemented).\n\nOn the other hand, there are one-time costs associated with adding a new payment method - you have to integrate it in your web store etc. The merchants have already paid that cost for Paypal/CC (and new merchants have to, because bitcoin-only will not yield many customers).\n\nThis is why getting bitcoin adopted is so hard. Customers have absolutely no incentive to use it (unless discounts are offered). It is advantageous to merchants, but also bears large one-time costs for them (integrating it into web shop software will certainly cost a few man-hours) for limited benefit.\n\nAll of you who prefer Bitcoin on priciple, and choose merchants based on this, are the only reason that could motivate a rationally thinking merchant to add Bitcoin as a payment option.': 7, 'We (merchants) already know about bitcoin and love it, now if only more customers knew about it and used it (its still hard to buy them in many countries :( )': 1}, ('Bitcoin, the bank of you.', 10): {'The Bitcoin tip for a grilled cheese (4,753 bits/$1.79) has been collected by *ToUDFj39546284Guy*.\n\n\n[ChangeTip info](https://www.changetip.com/tip-online/reddit) | [ChangeTip video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AnfKpypMNw) | /r/Bitcoin': 1, 'Here is what the linked meme says in case it is blocked at your school/work or is unavailable for any reason:\n\n#***Bitcoin vs Banks***  \n\n>***Post Title:***  *Bitcoin, the bank of you.* \n\n>***Top:***  *BANKS: CHARGING YOU TO ACCESS YOUR OWN MONEY AND SEIZING IT AT WILL* \n\n>***Bottom:***  *BITCOIN: NO FEES.

Saying that bitcoin is "trustless" is misleading because getting rid of the middle-man sometimes makes a transaction *more* dangerous. In cases where you are dealing with a new or unknown merchant (e.g. a seller on eBay), many folks prefer to trust their payment processor or bank (with whom they have a long-term relationship) to resolve any problems rather than give a bunch of digital cash to the other guy and hope for the best.\n\nLet\'s clarify this. In a typical e-commerce transaction, you are trusting several parties: the bank, the payment processor, and the other guy (e.g. the merchant). Bitcoin gets rid of trusting that the bank or payment processor will cheat you. You still have to trust the other guy to provide the service you are paying for. If you don\'t know the other guy well and he doesn\'t have an established reputation, then you probably *will* want a middleman. \n\nOf course, in cases where middlemen are desirable, the two parties using bitcoin are free to choose any sort of middle-man they agree upon to help resolve disputes. This is advantageous because they can choose a middleman who has the relevant knowledge and expertise to efficiently handle any disputes.\n\nPersonally, I think "No middleman required" and "No need to trust a middleman" are good, accurate, neutral ways to describe what bitcoin allows you to do.

Explaining this will involve going into a little depth about what the 'crypto challenge' is. Firstly, the concept of the sha256 hashing function. This function takes an input and outputs a number (a very big number). The input could be a single letter or the holy bible, the output will always be a number of a fixed length. A given input will always give the same output. Crucially, even a tiny change to the input *completely* changes this output number. There is no way to 'game' this hashing function to give you the number you want.\n\nThe 'crypto challenge' is thus: 'find an input to sha256 for which the output number is less than X' (This threshold X is the difficulty). The only way to do that is to repeatedly try different inputs until you get an output number that is low enough. The winning 'answer' is that input which gave the low output number. When you reveal the answer, everyone can instantly check it by running the hashing function once, and making sure the output number is low enough. Part of the input has to be a hash of the previous block which you can't predict, which is why everyone has to start again once a new block is found (you can't just store up some winning inputs and use them when you want).\n\nObviously it takes MANY tries of different inputs to get an answer low enough. To prove to the pool operator that you've been trying, you simply show the inputs that give numbers that are quite low, but not low enough to win the block.

Patrick Byrne essentially is funding Perianne Boring and her Digital Chamber of Commerce. Bitcoin Foundation hired a lobbyist and Bitcoin Foundation\'s offices are actually in Washington D.C., not too far from the White House.\n\nLarge venture capitalist firms, like Andreessen/Horowitz, pantera and others, they already employ very expensive lobbyists who seek influence with politicians, (off the books so to speak), through networking and connections made in Washington D.C., as they offer politicians what they want from the industry, i.e., some measure of power and control over the bitcoin industry or whatever industry the investors represented by these VC firms "lobby for".\n\nSo, this first method uses the craft of "influence" in Washington D.C. to bargain with "policy makers", (which is a lobbyist term for seated, elected officials), and to bargain with them so that the people who pay these lobbyists will get regulations put in place which benefit their business models, their investors, etc ...\n\nThis first method is kind of unethical and immoral and is the basis for much speculation that there is a great deal of corruption and criminal activity, bribery, etc ... in Washington D.C. among those who "lobby" elected officials. Books, television series, major news articles, substantial federal and state level criminal trials and non-fiction masterpieces chronicle the criminal collusion between seated, elected officials and the gigantic money of venture capitalists and industry "insiders", the influence they exercise on seated, elected officials outside of legal and ethical boundaries ... but that\'s how things are done in Washington D.C.. What do these "seated, elected officials" get in return from the Perianne Boring\'s and the lobbyists? \n\nWhat do politicians want from big money? You can answer this question yourself, they want many, many things, mostly, power and control.\n\nThe second method is, (would best be), to take all these tens of millions of dollars that are pouring into Washington D.C. to fund these "educational initiatives" and Jerry Brito and Ben styled unregistered and registered lobbyist efforts in Washington D.C. and put that money to work actually supporting candidates running for office that support bitcoin, those candidates that are taking the true risks associated with bitcoin by using bitcoin, by taking bitcoin as a donation for their campaigns, etc ..., these candidates who bring the awareness of bitcoin to the masses their constituents represent.\n\nDo we bitcoiners want the special interests of big, private money influencing law and regulation by currying "special favor" with our elected officials, or would it be more effective to have actual members of the US Congress in place elected through the will of bitcoiners to represent all of our interests in Washington D.C.?\n\nRemember, these giant venture capitalist firms and their investors have had lobbyists and employ lobbying firms in Washington D.C. regularly, its a part of the business plan, long, long before bitcoin, now these assets in Washington D.C. will be exercised on behalf of the venture capitalists and investors interests in the bitcoin space, not for me and you and the average bitcoin supporter but for the wealthiest and most powerful among our bitcoin community. That\'s the truth, deny it and life sucks, accept it and you might be able to actually do something about it, but deny it and you are a slave to the wealth interests, just like the same as it ever was.\n\nThis second method, to get representation in the halls of government that supports bitcoin, rather than special interests groups making deals with seated incumbents, deals that benefit the people who pay for these Washington "bitcoin insiders" to carry on their "missions" ... this second method is NOT favored by almost all of the extremely wealthy people in the bitcoin community and the bitcoin VC community because seated politicians who KNOW about and understand bitcoin, also understand the "under the table" missions of the bitcoin Washington D.C. lobbyists, and the lobbyists working for wealthy bitcoin individuals and groups, they DO NOT want to see politicians who understand and support bitcoin elected to office ... because those politicians would then interfere with the plans and the missions of wealthy interests making deals with "policy makers" in Washington D.C..\n\nSeeing good people elected to office to support and champion bitcoin is anti-thetical to the lobbyist mentality. The lobbyists want power and want leadership and decision making power, they don\'t want politicians interfering in those plans who can provide leadership and decision making power.\n\nFor reference, you can see the list of politicians that ran for political office in 2014, this past and recent midterm elections cycle, those politicians which openly supported and championed bitcoin within their campaigns for office here:\n\nhttp://bitpolitic.com/list-of-all-bitcoin-candidates\n\nOf note, the new governor of Texas, Greg Abbott, is a big, big bitcoin supporter and he received little to no support from bitcoiners at the level of which I have spoken, big venture capitalists and investors in the bitcoin space. Although Governor Abbott will exercise immeasurable power over bitcoin regulatory law in Texas, the wealthy bitcoiners and VC in the space fear this type of person. Greg Abbott has his own plans for Texas and Texas as it concerns bitcoin. Greg Abbott was the Attorney General of Texas for the past 12 years and his facility with law as it respects business regulation is so much more developed than any other lawyer in the bitcoin space we could easily suggest that Greg Abbott is one of the most knowledgabe and "practiced" attorneys in the regulatory space. Private attorneys working for big bitcoin money do not like Greg Abbott as Abbott seeks to serve the people, whereas the bitcoin attorneys in the space work to serve their "special interests", for that is how they butter their bread.\n\nWith specific reference to your allusion, or analogy ... to how hard, (how much money was spent by), how hard communications companies lobby and influence politics, it\'s important to identify who these telecommunications lobbyists analogs are in the bitcoin industry space at this time. Who are the bitcoin industry lobbyists working to influence and curry "special favor" with seated, elected officials in Washington D.C., (our elected officials).\n\nWhen you start to identify who the elements are in the bitcoin ecosystem that are spending huge sums of money to lobby elected officials in Washington D.C., you can quickly see that the average bitcoiner has no voice in Washington D.C. when compared to the tens of millions of dollars that VC and wealthy bitcoin interests are pouring into the influence process in Washington D.C..\n\nWe are now seeing the majority of monies available to "influence" Washington D.C. on behalf of those VC and their clients and bitcoin companies having effect in Washington D.C., and they will as a natural course make deals with the credit card companies to ensure a regulatory environment which MAINTAINS the flow of money into their boards, that pays their salaries and expenses. And if they did not do this, and did not accomplish this, they would be fired by their VC companies that employ them and the investors that expect them to do this.\n\nEither we as bitcoiners become politically engaged and support and rally for candidates to be elected to office to represent our interests, or bitcoin lobbyists WILL write the bitcoin regulations and make deals with the banks, the credit card companies and the politicians to suit the needs of their Venture Capitalist funding and their business investments ... not "bitcoiners".\n\nEither we succeed in getting elected officials in office that support and champion bitcoin, or much like the bankers in the early 1900\'s who wrote the banking laws, (federal reserve act), and those same bankers who lobbied and influenced our elected officials to pass those laws from which we now suffer greatly, the same thing will happen with respect to bitcoin. Bitcoin is math, lobbyists and incumbent elected officials are people. Bitcoin will not change people, bitcoin gives people who want fairness and an egalitarian society to proceed, it gives us the OPPORTUNITY to do things right, but in doing nothing, it will all happen again just as it did before, because that is the system in place and big bitcoin money is certainly exercising that system and ignoring the electoral and representative process to a great extent, and unfortunately, the small bitcoiner and the average bitcoiner follow the money as well, into the pit of political corruption. That is the human condition and bitcoin ONLY gives us an opportunity to EXERCISE that can change that condition for the better.': 1}, ('Miners Happy as Mining Difficulty drops slightly after an exponential curve .', 1): {}, ('Showerthought: Xiaomi in the shoes of bitcoin, vice versa?', 1): {'Enjoy a donuthole on me /u/changetip': 1, 'thank you kiisfm!
