If it does not confirm you can go back and add some, then add some more etc until it confirms.\n\nI see. So basically it enables a payer to negotiate over the fee amount. But in a rather clumsy way. A payer has to keep an eye on his transaction to see whether it gets included into a block, and when it doesn't, use RBF. The time between sending the initial transaction and the RBF transaction can be hours.\n\nMuch better it would be if a payer can just send off a transaction once and still can be certain that it will be accepted eventually. The transaction should be structured such that it lets miners compete on fee amount.\n\nTechnically I imagine the payer sends this all at once.\n\nImagine that the next block is block number B. The payer sends the following three transactions all at once with increasing fee amounts:\n\nTx1: pay with fee f (normal tx).\nTx2: identical to Tx1 but pay with fee f+i1; do not include into a block before block B+1.\nTx3: identical to Tx1 but pay with fee x+i2 (i2 > i1); do not include into a block before block B+2.\n\nEach miner has the following two simple options:\n\nInclude Tx1 in block B for a low fee.\nDo not include Tx1 in block B. This has a high probability of losing out on the transaction fee, but if blocks are full and all other transactions carry a higher fee amount then this is an economically rational decision.\n\nIf a miner that did not include Tx1 finds block B, then Tx1 remains unconfirmed and in the mempool.\n\nBoth Tx1 as well as Tx2 carrying a higher fee can now be included into block B+1. Tx2 is now more likely to be included into block B+1 because each miner is more likely to want to secure the higher fee carried by Tx2. Still an altruistic miner may still chose to accept Tx1 and its lower fee.\n\nIf Tx2 is still not included, Tx3 becomes eligible for inclusion carrying a yet higher fee.\n\nThe end result is that the payer just sends off three transactions of which only one can be included, but such that it forces miners to compete on fees. By looking at the fee amounts of the transactions, the payer as well as the receiver can know the probability of the payment being settled, which will approach 100% if the payment includes a transaction with a non-zero transaction fee.\n\nThe only change needed to make this work I guess is for miners being able to recognize that three transactions having the same inputs and outputs but differing fee amounts are not a double spend attempt but a negotiation of the fee amount.\n\nIf I am not mistaken it is perhaps already possible now without *any* changes to Core.": 1, 'Then it would only take a fake/stolen ID to trick the ATM machine.': 5, "They don't, because it it very unlikely to happen.

Otherwise the window to double spend a transaction with a normal/standard fee before it reaches 1 confirmation is a matter of 10-15 minutes. Or 15-30 minutes if it done with a low-fee.
