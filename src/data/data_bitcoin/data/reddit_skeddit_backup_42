Current consensus rules require\nthat blocks have a block header time greater than the locktime specified\nin any transaction in that block.\n\nMiners get to choose what time they use for their header time, with the\nconsensus rule being that no node will accept a block whose time is more\nthan two hours in the future.  This creates a incentive for miners to\nset their header times to future values in order to include locktimed\ntransactions which weren\'t supposed to be included for up to two more\nhours.\n\nThe consensus rules also specify that valid blocks may have a header\ntime greater than that of the median of the 11 previous blocks.  This\nGetMedianTimePast() time has a key feature we generally associate with\ntime: it can\'t go backwards.\n\n[BIP113][] specifies a soft fork enforced in this release that\nweakens this perverse incentive for individual miners to use a future\ntime by requiring that valid blocks have a computed GetMedianTimePast()\ngreater than the locktime specified in any transaction in that block.\n\nMempool inclusion rules currently require transactions to be valid for\nimmediate inclusion in a block in order to be accepted into the mempool.\nThis release begins applying the BIP113 rule to received transactions,\nso transaction whose time is greater than the GetMedianTimePast() will\nno longer be accepted into the mempool.\n\n**Implication for miners:** you will begin rejecting transactions that\nwould not be valid under BIP113, which will prevent you from producing\ninvalid blocks when BIP113 is enforced on the network. Any\ntransactions which are valid under the current rules but not yet valid\nunder the BIP113 rules will either be mined by other miners or delayed\nuntil they are valid under BIP113. Note, however, that time-based\nlocktime transactions are more or less unseen on the network currently.\n\n**Implication for users:** GetMedianTimePast() always trails behind the\ncurrent time, so a transaction locktime set to the present time will be\nrejected by nodes running this release until the median time moves\nforward. To compensate, subtract one hour (3,600 seconds) from your\nlocktimes to allow those transactions to be included in mempools at\napproximately the expected time.\n\nFor more information about the implementation, see\n<https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6566>\n\nMiscellaneous\n-------------\n\nThe p2p alert system is off by default.

Technically, Bitcoin is pseudonymous and publicly traceable.   So at a minimum the party selling to you would know your Bitcoin address.  \n\nThere are ways you can keep your financial privacy when transacting with Bitcoin, but that\'s going to involve using cash when buying and not a credit card.\n\nWhy might you want financial privacy?   The reason is different for every person and transaction.   Nunya is a reason.  "Because it\'s nunya business" is a perfectly valid reason to want financial privacy.        Or maybe you are spending with an online pharmacy for some medication that you don\'t necessarily want your wife (who handles the credit card statement) to know about.\n\nHowever, keeping privacy can be expensive and/or be a hassle.  Getting bitcoin with cash means meeting up with a seller to transact face-to-face.  Credit cards are convenient for buying bitcoin.   But you lose some of your financial privacy doing that then.\n\nKeep in mind though, it isn\'t necessarily the privacy at when you buy bitcoin that most people are concerned about.      It\'s concern about their privacy when spending the bitcoin.     You can de-link the coins you buy from the coins you spend, making tracing the bitcoins you spend to the ones you buy something quite difficult to accomplish.   But when buying with credit card evidence exists that you did buy X amount of bitcoins on a certain date.\n\nSo that\'s a primary reason that someone wanting to keep their financial privacy then wouldn\'t want to buy Bitcoin with a credit card.': 2, "You didn't like the responses here? https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/4e10qr/why_should_i_buy_bitcoin_anonymously/": 2, 'Yes this guy explain really really nice, I was missing something so this helped': 1, "He's testing everywhere to see who fall into his trap.": 1}, ("Stay away from Satoshidice.com they are thieves and support sucks.
