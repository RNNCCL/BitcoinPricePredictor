If you don't tie the value at any point in time to the specific utility, it is hard to distinguish between one network with n nodes and another.

There is no such thing as a mandatory update; there\'s no way to enforce it.\n\nIn the meantime, a chain split would be very likely. That incident over the weekend is just a sample of the confusion a persistent chain split would cause.': 2, "Very interesting perspective.

This avoids the risk of getting attacked by people mining the majority fork.": 1, "Hard forks are much safer in this respect than soft forks, because unupgraded miners just think the main chain is invalid and keep mining on the old one.

That somebody needs a minimum of 25%, and all they'd accomplish would be a brief fork until some miners realised what was happening and switched back. But in reality nearly all the remaining 25% will have switched over during the grace period rather than be left mining dead coins, so unless you have more like something in the high 40s all you'll accomplish will be orphaning your own blocks.

There's no reason the original can't continue on indefinitely with just 25% of the pre-fork hashing capacity that it had. Eventually difficulty will adjust and it will be back to 10 minute blocks.\n\nThe point is, unless there is real consensus among miners in the 95% + range, there's a risk of a bifurcate chain.  That risk is more severe for the hardfork since if the original chain regains some of the lost hashing capacity, the big blocks side risks losing to the original chain if it ever regains status as longest chain/most work.

If there was that much opposition out there, you'd never get the 75%.": 1, "I think there's a kind-of lingering folk memory about this from the days before SPV wallets, when ordinary users needed to run full nodes to buy their drugs and alpaca socks with, and it was assumed to be very difficult to make those people upgrade. Nowadays if you're running a full node it's most likely because you're either a technical enthusiast, running some kind of service with it or have very particular security requirements, and those are the kind of people most likely to be keeping an eye on things.\n\nAt this point I think there's a strong argument to be made that we should stop doing soft forks and just do hard ones.": 3, 'Part of the problem here is that there\'s no consensus about what "consensus" means. This issue is quite political and one person\'s bug (nodes falling over, expensive transactions, wallets can\'t cope) is another person\'s feature (It\'s a beautiful baby fee market!) so even if most of the core committers agree to an increase there are still going to be people out there trying to FUD whatever they release, and this may end up holding up miner adoption.': 2, 'AFAIK, in the two previous "bug forks" the software switch was mostly over in less than 24 hours, because Gavin contacted the major miners and nodes and made them aware of the bug.   \n\nSo, if it is a real unquestionable emergency, the block size may be increased in a few days.  However, there are some who actually *want* the network to be congested -- because their business plans require pushing users to another network, or for other reasons.  Those players may refuse to increase and may try to convince miners to keep rejecting blocks >1 MB.': 2, 'When just about everybody with half a brain agrees (*"consensus"*) blocks are obviously too tiny, then the oligarchy in control of the reference source code waves their magic wand and 1000s of nodes quickly upgrade along with all the services running on top of them before anything bad happens.': 1, "IMHO not very fast, we're talking months, with hard fork some really solid consensus is needed.": 0, '> everybody else is so strongly opposed that they\'d pick the side that didn\'t have the longest chain, and there are zero pragmatic people in the middle. \n\nBitcoin has way more "work" being proved (i.e., computational effort) than the next largest coin (Litecoin), yet some people still use that alt.

But without consensus you get catastrophic consensus failure.\n\nIf the nVersion supermajority threshold is 75% as proposed, get the top 10 pools to mine against Bitcoin-XT and two weeks later (as programmed in) the ability to include a big block will be possible -- as long as that big block is not before January 11th, 2016.\n\nNow the problem with that is: a.) Just because a miner sets the tag nVersion=4 when mining doesn\'t mean that miner is really supporting big blocks.  There are various reasons why a miner might do that ranging from innocent/lazy to malicious intent to cause two persistent chains.   b.) There still could be the remaining 25% of mining capacity still on the original chain.  This would cause slower blocks (i.e., ~40 minutes with 25% of the hashing capacity for that current difficulty level), but the chain could persist even with just that 25% since the hardfork chain with the big blocks would be considered valid.\n\nSo if the "sudden event" causes the hard fork to go forward without consensus then essentially what happens is that you have the original chain with its coins (BTC) and a new fork created by Bitcoin-XT that acts like a new coin -- one with an initial distribution (premine) of the 15M or whatever units existed at the time of the fork.   For simplicity, let\'s call the new coin BTX.

The other two use a network of partnered banks and credit unions that let you use any member ATM in that network to deposit/withdraw for free. \n\nIn the US it's a bit different for better or for worst.

So while there are 3 banks in my town and about 6-7 within the greater region of the city accessible to me. But add in direct banks and there's about 20 banks available. Some only offer savings but it's still a number of banks and credit unions. In the US you'll find more even direct banking competition as well (just more banks in general). \n\nSo you can avoid big banks that might hate Bitcoin. But even if they aren't Bitcoin friendly and they shut down your account, well just go to an other bank. There's a handful to choose from. \n\n The brick and mortar banking market is largely an oligopoly. But the moment you add in direct banks there is an abundantly competitive banking industry.
