If a miner issues a block that is larger, the other nodes will reject it.  This "feature" was originally put in the protocol when bitcoins had no value to stop jokers from spamming junk transactions into the blockchain just to waste space.\n\nAnyway, my proposal is a small modification to Gavin\'s which is to not have a hard 20MB limit but to allow blocks to be larger if txn fees are bigger.

So the txn can be included in the block at any location < T(fee).  \n\nTherefore the protocol in fact requires what you are suggesting -- txns are left out of the block if they don't pay a high enough fee (and there are more pending txns than space in the block).  But at the same time, the supply (space in a block) is increased as higher paying transactions are available.\n\nYou may think that each miner should decide himself whether a transaction is paying enough.  That approach may work.  However, all nodes need to store every block so the cost of including a txn is network-wide even though only the miner gets the fee.  So there is an argument that a minimum fee for excessively large blocks should defined across all miners.\n\nThe only real risk here is that the price of BTC explodes and so the fees (in USD terms) become so excessive that no txn fees ever meet the minimum fee (this situation devolves into today's hard 20MB limit).  This is easily solved but every solution unfortunately complicates the algorithm which is why Gavin's totally simple 20MB proposal is the stopgap we need today.  But an approach to a solution would basically look at how many of the last N blocks were 100% filled without expansion/how many were filled with expansion.  If this ratio is high, txn fee is too high.  Alternately you could look at the ratio of free txns to fee txns in the last N 100% filled blocks (weighted by fee).  If there are very few free txns (they are being crowded out), reduce the fee needed to expand the block.\n": 1, "So paying a fee of *F* would allow your transaction to be located within a mined block at any offset less than T(*F*). If the block is of size *S*, then the probability that your transaction will be included in the block is T(*F*)/*S*. If you want a higher probability, then pay a higher fee. Is this accurate?\n\nThe problem I see with this strategy is that it's impossible to know at the time you build a transaction how large the next block will be, so you cannot target a specific probability for inclusion. (This problem is equally present in the fixed block size scenario, as one cannot know when building a transaction how many transactions will be competing for space in the block.)\n\n> So there is an argument that a minimum fee for excessively large blocks should defined across all miners.\n\nSo this would be a new consensus rule? A block is invalid if it contains any transaction whose fee is *F* and whose location in the block is greater than T(*F*)? I suppose this could work, though it presents a new complication, which you rightly pointed out: there then needs to be a consensus algorithm for determining the function T(*f*).": 1, "Yes, it does.  For appropriate amounts, it does.  But it's even worse if you are competing with checks or ACH payments for larger transactions.  Those are effectively free!

If the cost of finding a block were low, but the reward as well, then the network would still be perfectly secure.\n\nIf the cost of finding a block became too high relative to the reward, the hash rate would drop. This wouldn't make the network less secure however. \n": 1, "Why isn't Gavin acknowledging the likelihood that many (most?) transactions traversing the Bitcoin network today are fluff? Since it's effectively free to send Bitcoin transactions today, users are indiscriminate about how they use Bitcoin. Need to pay five friends? Send five transactions. Don't bother learning to use `sendmany`; transactions are (effectively) free! But in a future world, where space in the block chain is constrained, users will have to be more judicious (less frivolous) in their usage of transactions.\n\nIt's the same thing we saw when gas prices spiked at the end of the last decade. Suddenly the cost of traveling from point A to point B became a relevant factor in people's internal priority evaluations, and we saw people avoiding unnecessary trips or batching multiple errands into one trip to save on gas costs. The same will happen with Bitcoin transactions.\n\nNote that this is not to say that we don't need to raise the block size limit. We do, eventually.

In real life, if the demand (price) is high enough, new supply appears to meet it.  The way Bitcoin is currently organized that does not happen.  The block size is fixed.  So traditional analysis using the supply demand curve does not work.  Its a cliff.  If demand is on average 110% of current supply, the Bitcoin network will never be able to commit all transactions.  People will leave the network.\n\nBut actually, this suggests an interesting solution.  Create a supply/demand curve by creating a variable supply:\n\nAny-fee txns are accepted in the first 20MB of each block.  Beyond that, txns must pay a fee, say start at 1 uBTC and multiply by 2 for each additional megabyte (of course, someone would have to analyze this carefully to see what the suggested per MB fee is, and ideally allow it to vary).\n\nSo if you created a txn with a 64uBTC fee, your txn could be placed within the first 26 MB (20 + log2(64)) of a block. \n\nSo there is no "hard" block limit.  Additional supply is created as txn fees go up.\n\nYou could probably price this properly (within an order of magnitude anyway) by looking at the historical relationship between BTC price and # transactions.': 11, "if we do nothing than Bitcoin is fairly useless long term.

Their filter on reality rejects conflicting information before it enters their consciousness. Some internet definitions of, and relating to, a true believer:\n\n * One who is deeply, sometimes fanatically devoted to a cause, organization, or person:\n\n * a zealous supporter of a particular cause: "*it\'s impossible to argue with those true believers, as they think any counter-evidence is proof of an evil conspiracy*"\n\n * Zealous: fervent, ardent, fervid, fanatical, passionate, impassioned, devout, devoted, committed, dedicated, hard-core, enthusiastic, eager, keen, overkeen, avid, card-carrying, vigorous, energetic, intense, fierce;\n\n * A person who earnestly believes in something, despite overwhelming scientific evidence to the contrary. Usually used as a derogatory term to imply the lack of critical thinking and/or intelligence on part of the true believer. Particularly when that\'s the case.\n\n * *True-believer syndrome* is an expression coined by M. Lamar Keene to describe an apparent cognitive disorder characterized by believing in the reality of paranormal or supernatural events after one has been presented overwhelming evidence that the event was fraudulently staged.\n\nIn this context, the guy (in this sub) who said "*I truly believe bitcoin is going to take over the entire world economy*" would probably be a true believer. As those who believe "*bitcoin will end States, and finally bring about world peace*".

There will be one coin, or there will be many.\n\nThen some legitimate 2.0 coins started showing up.\nThe value of having \'side experiments\' was very clear. Market valuations indicated the perceived value of those experiments. But invariably, the self-diluting nature of having various cryptos competing directly against themselves caught up, and new cryptos need, in general, to have something legitimately valuable about them to have staying power and value.\n\nWhen Counterparty, Mastercoin came along, a new possible was conceived of. One where a single umbrella holds all crypto, which is then divided into separated assets.\n\nThe past few months, there has been a raging debate about whether sidechains risk systemically destroying bitcoin, or being its future.\n\nI want to be very clear.

I\'m rather confused.  If you\'re not aware the technology used for wallet seeds elsewhere was developed by Pieter (and the original design for the public derivation came from me).  Use of a HD wallet is not security neutral, and they way they\'re commonly used reduces functionality and security for the users (effectively there is only a single private key that if lost/exported/leaked in any way can completely compromise the wallet).\n\nThe cryptography to allow public derivation was a novel invention of mine-- and we\'ve been rightfully slow to deploy it. That said, there is a full implementation in Bitcoin Core; but it isn\'t currently exposed to users.\n\nIn spite of contributing substantially to it, I have not personally considered this functionality very important, or making it available a high priority-- so I\'m surprised to see you repeadily describe Bitcoin Core as "unusable" for its lack of it. Is this really your view or am I misunderstanding?\n\nThere are many ways Bitcoin Core could be improved as a wallet, but generally it works pretty well (minus known things like, having the cost of being a fulll node) unfortunately the growth of the blockchain has everyone who thinks Bitcoin Core\'s wallet should be good completely busy keeping the system running at all.  Some other developers would like to remove the wallet entirely (or drop support for 32 bit hosts, and other features that make it useful for ordinary users at all, etc.).\n\nI don\'t know if you\'re a programmer yourself; but even contributions in the form of documenting usability challenges could help contribute to prioritizing and improving the experience of users on full nodes. It\'s my belief that-- at least with reasonably limited block sizes-- the user experience of using a full node powered wallet could be absolutely as good as SPV or Electrum (or even better than these things are today). It\'s just a matter of applying effort to the right areas.  E.g. Full node wallets can start as SPV and slowly sync up in the background, usable instantly, but with full security automatically after some time; with good controls on how much of your system resource to use for other people and a low enough minimum to run comfortably on laptops.

The slowly worsening experience and increased cost of running a node drives people away slowly-- accepting increased centralization and third party trust, without creating a flag day that people can rally around and focus efforts on fixing things correctly.\n\nThis is how we have a tiny fraction of the reachable nodes we once had, widespread dependence on centralized services, huge mining pools with enormous latent discretionary control of transactions, etc. Failure modes that are obvious and painful are preferable to ones that just silently strip away the system\'s value.\n\nIt might not pan out that way; there are currently people going around with crazy applications like wanting to store porn collections in the bitcoin network to make them "censor proof" (in reality if the capacity were wide enough to do that, it would just create a new class of pressures against running nodes: that you might be committing a strict liability crime)... if there no nearby limit, we\'re basically just counting on miners to act as Luke-jr like "censors" to artificially constrain the space to keep out inefficient uses of the system that would suck up chain space due to cheap highly replicated storage; basically externalizing the costs of thousands of copies of the data onto all the other users who didn\'t agree to let that transaction into a block.': 1, '"All time low"?

THAT is the simplest solution of ALL.\n\nIf it's the case that a block can hold 20MB of transactions, then maybe we will *see* 20MB of on-chain transactions. The question is, is that optimal from a supply and demand perspective? If it's $100 to cross the bridge to SF instead of $10, less people would cross it by car. People would only cross if they really needed to, which is how it should be with the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nIf you had a startup, wouldn't you rather deploy a blockchain explorer on your local Windows PC as easily as you run Firefox or an FTP client? If we freeze the block size limit ad wait ten years, maybe you could.

Instead all we hear is a conclusion that it will lead to centralisation without any analysis.\n\nIn fact, as far as estimates are concerned, anyone with a "pretty good" connection is able to run a node even if the max blocksize was used from day 1 which may be unlikely. The blockchain is already big and it already uses much bandwith, cpu, etc. Therefore the individuals currently running a node are likely to not be the average joe, but someone with a "pretty good" connection. How many of them would stop running a node? 10%, 20%, 30%, 50%? Is 4,000 nodes centralised? Is 3,000, 2,000, etc.\n\nAll we hear by the critics is a conclusion without analysis.

Especially those that are parsing the block chain for specific data - it\'s orders of magnitude faster to do so on a local copy than by querying nodes over the network.\n\nMy perspective is that the decline in nodes that we see is of the altruistic users who are switching to lightweight clients for everyday use.

Part of that cost is a lack of wallet seed, but it\'s not even close to a main driver of cost.\n\nFull nodes should be as easy to run on an "old" Windows PC as an antivirus program. Average Joe should be able to sync the full blockchain in minutes, without stressing his CPU, bandwidth or disk space. It\'s insanity to be talking about Moore\'s Law allowing us to *survive* bigger blocks when Bitcoin full nodes are already too taxing to run on consumer hardware.

There are definite reasons they _should be_ but many aren't.\n\nRegardless of the motivations, centralizing around businesses to protect the economic, social, and political properties of Bitcoin seems like a recipe for disaster... The regulatory framework around finance is such a mess that operating business are targets, and inevitably most follow a predictable response to external pressure: Step (0) Capitulate completely, Step (1) violate user's rights, autonomy, and privacy in anticipation of future demands-- even if there is no reason or a government order to perform such an act would itself be unlawful.

Ie, in our current world iof 1mb blocks, blocksize can range from something minuscule up to 1MB tops, and that 990kb block will still only require 990lb, regardless of whether the max blocksize is 1mb or 20mb\n\nThat's my understanding, at least. Am I wrong? Because if not, I don't see what the pushback against increasing the blocksize is about- if there are 20mb worth of transactions that need to process, either they could be put into 1 new block, or would have to be spread across 20 1mb blocks, over the course of approximately 200 minutes. Seems the first situation is the more optimal one, no? It doesn't sound like increasing the block size will result in spiraling storage demands, unless the transaction level merits that. \n\nOr am I missing something?  Does 1 block consume 1Mb currently, regRdlesd of whether there are 5 or 500 transactions in it? And would that hold true for 20 mb blocks, a block containing a single transaction would require 20 mob of storage space?\n\nOnly if that last paragraph is true would I understand why people are opposed to increasing the block size. \n\nSo what is it?

In the best case, the merchant would use Electrum, because doing so would be supporting a federated network of full nodes rather than full nodes run by a Bitcoin bank or broker, as those companies will be heavily regulated and could be pressured in all kinds of subtle ways.\n\n/u/mike_hearn is correct: Bitcoin *client* development is easy. Full node development OTOH, is the polar opposite. There are only a handful of cleanly reimplemented full nodes, and there is presumably little to no adoption of anything outside of Bitcoin Core or btcd. Libbitcoin has improved significantly as well, but it\'s risky to have full nodes being predominantly deployed by companies. Companies are necessarily subservient to regulators, and developers subservient to their users. Threatening decentralization of full nodes is risking it all on THESE companies, who will become full node gatekeepers. I repeat, how many companies are using anything besides centralized APIs or in-house APIs built on Bitcoin Core?  Mike is correct, Bitcoin CLIENTS are easy, but full nodes are not, and neither is getting full nodes adopted. Only within the last *month* was Libbitcoin able to link Bitcoin Core\'s consensus lib, which is of paramount importance but just goes to show how nascent the market for full nodes is. It should also reveal that things in Bitcoin are heading in a direction that looks unfamiliar to many.\n\nFundamentally, Bitcoin QT could be given a nicer user interface with support for wallet seeds. Just to reiterate, if you thought Bitcoin client development was sufficiently decentralized, can you point to a single example of a GUI full node application besides Bitcoin Core or Armory?  That is count em: *two* open source GUI full nodes. Neither of them are even *close* to being ready for usage by the general public. I would call this the opposite of decentralized, unless you\'re a believe in Electrum. Because if Electrum\'s client-server SPV mode doesn\'t become widely used, most full nodes WILL be run by regulated middlemen. The buck stops with the full node, *not* with SPV.\n\nThe problem is running a full node is ALREADY heavily taxing on the CPU and bandwidth. No GUI full node is instant on. Bitcoin QT doesn\'t even support wallet seeds. It\'s utterly unusable by the public, yet it\'s one of TWO widely adopted full nodes. The only counterforce between that and complete centralization is the good will of the Bitcoin developers to uphold unchallengeable objectively beneficial and extremely highly scrutinized technical standards.\n\nIf you support simplicity, then isn\'t the simplest action taking *no* action? It\'s unquestionably too much trouble to run a full node today in an average personal computing environment. If Satoshi thought people SPV clients would be a panacea, he was saying so back when 1 BTC cost less than $10, and when it didn\'t look remotely possible for Bitcoin\'s to succeed anywhere near so quickly and astronomically. In addition, Bitcoin was in a very gray legal area and the amount of agora projects was considerably higher. Perhaps we were just ignorant back then, but times have changed.\n\nConsidering you are risking Bitcoin\'s decentralization, I would fully expect you and Gavin to present documented evidence of Bitcoin mainnet or even *testnet* becoming overwhelmed due to blocks being overfull. My subjective experience has been saving bitcoin more than spending it. When people say they\'re in support of seeing what happens, it\'s because **we know Bitcoin\'s network effect for savers will remain intact no matter how bogged down the network gets.** What\'s not so sure is what would happen if it\'s no longer possible for an unfunded entrepreneur to set up his own full node. Is it right to think of "100% trustless" Bitcoin services, full nodes, as being out of the reach of the average person? If so, then Bitcoin makes it inevitable for the individual to lose power AGAIN to companies and therefore the government.\n\nMost people simply save their bitcoin, never spending it. The main property of Bitcoin is its limited supply and **arguable** decentralization.\n\nThat is what is at stake here! If Bitcoin is centralized, who cares if the network doesn\'t get bogged down ever? Which altcoin is going to biting at Bitcoin\'s tail if it gets bogged down but remains the most highly documented, secure and private solution that is guaranteed to be impervious to government attempts at meddling with the protocol. Hard forking Bitcoin Core to change the block size limit fundamentally makes it fair game for the government to compel Bitcoin Core developers to hard fork the supply limit and increase it beyond 21,000,000. This is a REALISTIC, highly dangerous existential threat to Bitcoin.\n\nGetting bogged down at payments isn\'t a world ending scenario for savers- and if it is Gavin should be able to present hard evidence quantifying the true risks. Making network wide decisions doesn\'t deserve to be relegated to social media blather - Bitcoin is essentially a corporation and we are all its shareholders. If a company were to communicate internally like this, it would be utter pandimonium, because these decisions could never be made without hierarchy. Either the real Satoshi Nakamoto takes a stand on this issue, or it\'s without question his intent not to care about the individual\'s ability to run a full node in an anti-state manner. By hard forking Bitcoin Core to concentrate full nodes in the hands of regulated middlemen, you can no longer prove that Bitcoin would survive a regulatory crackdown, or that the supply cap wouldn\'t be raised above 21,000,000.\n\nNetwork effect is more deciding than any other factor when it comes to a cryptocurrency\'s adoption. Will Bitcoin still have a network effect if the payment network predictably fails requiring users to resend with a transaction with a higher fee? That sounds like a trivial programming challenge, doesn\'t it? Bitcoin would still be in a different universe compared to fiat currencies in the very worst case.\n\nIANAL, but this withholding a hard fork demonstrates the Bitcoin Core protocol cannot be hard forked by committee, which is a very powerful assurance for fungibility. If there are no hard forks, it legally is much more difficult for anyone to compel the bitcoin developers to change the protocol in hard forking respects.\n\nSPV is not a silver bullet! Full nodes still aren\'t going away, and if it\'s hard to run them, that is a serious problem for individuals who want a truly P2P currency.

If we were to see a 20X increase in network activity then this would result in usage of 100 KB/S downstream and 1 - 2 MB/S upstream. I would have no problem serving that from my residential connection.\n\nHowever, on the bright side, there is plenty of room for optimization. IIRC, [Gavin has a proposal](https://gist.github.com/gavinandresen/e20c3b5a1d4b97f79ac2) that would cut the overall bandwidth usage since at the moment every transaction must be sent across the network twice - once when it is initially broadcast and once again in a block.

The FEDS are threatening these business guys with long prison sentences and forcing them to proactively, PROACTIVELY be aware of EVERY SINGLE MICRO TRANSACTION of all of their users. This is ridiculous. Banks don\'t proactively monitor their customers domestic remittances of petty cash ($25)... they wait for specific requests by the government or only flag large transactions ($10K+ right?). Even then, the bank isn\'t going to shut down a customer account based on one flagged transaction nor refuse to communicate with them anymore like in my case with Coinbase.\n\nThis is just another warning signal, a billow of smoke.

I don't see any point for a second, different key pair for that (e.g. PGP) if you don't have that established already. You need to securely distribute your public key in some way either way if people are to know that the predictions came from you. So you could, for example, meet personally the people who you want to be able to prove predictions to from your name and hand them your Bitcoin address (or public key). Then you will use this address' private key solely for these proof of publication transactions. You need to timely reveal all your predictions, otherwise you would lose your trustworthiness. So I think this protocol would need to include time/date when each prediction is to be revealed.\n\nI don't think it is necessary to encrypt anything - you could do the job with a [salted hash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_%28cryptography%29). Basically, you make sure every prediction message has enough randomness in it (this is needed to prevent attackers revealing your predictions prematurely) by putting a large random number (salt) next to the message and then just hashing it, the same way e.g. (http://proofofexistence.com/) does it. When it is time to prove the prediction, you just publish the exact message (together with the salt).\n\nPeople who know your proof-of-prediction Bitcoin address (public key) can look up all the transactions in the blockchain signed by your public key (in other words, originating from that address) and get all the prediction messages for expired predictions that you've published and verify them.\n\nUsing hashes is simpler and it allows you to use arbitrarily large prediction messages. On the other hand, if you use encryption you could achieve some nice properties. You could ensure that the prediction gets revealed after some roughly predictable amount of time, no matter what happens to you or to the secret data you would otherwise have to store. The encrypted message is already publicly available in the blockchain, so you only need to make sure the decryption key becomes available. For that you can use [Peter Todd's Timelock](https://pay.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/27adbq/timelock_timerelease_encryption_incentivised_by/) or something similar.\n\nI hope someone more competent than me helps towards this idea because I like the concept.": 2, '> Good point about the salt -- that way I wouldn\'t need to provide instructions on how to decrypt, I could simply provide the message + salt, the resulting hash, and people would be able to independently verify that the information was legit. \n\nThis isn\'t really relevant, because for the scheme to really work it is crucial that the whole history of predictions from a predictor is verified, which would probably be too much work to do manually, so it has to be written as a new software. On the other hand, the content of all predictions from a predictor need to be ultimately manually interpreted by human beings somehow if this scheme is to have any usefulness. They need to be checked to see if the events really make sense, if the predictions really show that the predictor has statistically significant good predicting abilities.\n\nWhat I see as the main use for this scheme is "proof of being an insider". You could use it to prove that you have inside information and/or power to affect some outcomes, possibly while maintaining privacy (pseudonymity). For example, you work at a company and want to gain a reputation as a provider of inside information, but you want to hide your real identity from your bosses and you also want to prevent them from manipulating the outcomes in the last minute just to make your good predictions bad. \n\nAnother use could be for a scientist who has a theory about something but, for some reason, wants to prove the practical usefulness of his theory through multiple predictions over time before revealing the theory itself (e.g. the theory may be too complex and time consuming to properly explain and/or his/her peers may not have the patience to listen) but in this use case affecting the outcome of predictions would probably not be an issue and so the predictions could be public from the start (but the other aspects of the scheme are still needed and I don\'t see a simpler way to do this).\n\nGiven a specific use case, additional logic can be written to automate some of the verification. E.g. if you are leaking a number from a periodical report, code could automate the process of verifying the accuracy of the predictions by parsing the report; verifying that the prediction (hash) was published before the report was made public; etc.': 1, ">Another use could be for a scientist who has a theory about something but, for some reason, wants to prove the practical usefulness of his theory through multiple predictions over time before revealing the theory itself (e.g. the theory may be too complex and time consuming to properly explain and/or his/her peers may not have the patience to listen) but in this use case affecting the outcome of predictions would probably not be an issue and so the predictions could be public from the start (but the other aspects of the scheme are still needed and I don't see a simpler way to do this).  \n\nThis is my use case. However, in my case affecting the outcome would be a significant risk, so I would have to hide my predictions and only reveal them after the event but prove I made them before the event.  \n\nRight now I'm planning on using the Proof of Existence site to generate the proof and then once the event occurs, I would release the document itself (and the proof of existence would verify its legitimacy and timestamp). ": 1, 'If he distributes his Bitcoin address *in advance*, before he starts making predictions, to all the parties he wants to convince of his good predictions (or has his identity verified later on through a web of trust, as with PGP) he can prove what all his predictions are and that he has not cheated.

Gavin initially even planned for automatic yearly growing the max block size.

So to say that Bitcoin "is supposed to be safe and not vulnerable to theft and inflation" is nonsense.': -1, 'Good to see Gavin talking about limitations of blocksize increases.\n\nThe question for us is if it\'s really worth it to "kick the can down the road" (Gavin\'s words) when we know for sure that this is a bandaid? We\'ve seen what happens when tx demand outstrips supply with Satoshidice and ChangeTip, and the market certainly does respond with solutions - Satoshidice got out-competed by cheaper and faster off-chain gambling sites, and the previous on-chain tipping systems were replaced by off-chain ChangeTip. Wallets have also been giving users the ability to set and/or estimate fees. In short this has happened before and the sky didn\'t fall down.\n\n20MB is a huge increase, over an order of magnitude.(1) For starters there are multiple known DoS attacks made possible by 20MB blocks, and who knows how many more we\'ll find? Some of them can be fixed easily, others involve fairly fundamental changes to the Bitcoin protocol to fix. (e.g. making old UTXO\'s expire somehow - a pruned full node could easily require dozens/hundreds of GB worth of disk space for the UTXO set if it\'s abused) We\'re also finding that some proposed solutions to known problems don\'t give as good improvements as we thought they would. \n\nOn a purely technical basis, a more gradual increase makes a lot of sense. We want to be able to find out about and respond to attacks, bugs, and performance problems gradually rather than all at once is much less risky than plunging straight into the deep end without a lifejacket. I\'m actually surprised that Gavin didn\'t simply propose that we go from 1MB blocks to 2MB blocks, with, say, another MB/year for the next nineteen years.\n\nOf course, as I keep telling startups in this space the current Bitcoin protocol fundamentally can\'t scale up in an unlimited way. Even if we did a 20MB blocksize limit increase, it\'s easy to imagine tx demand going up by 40x, or 400x. Yet we know that with the existing Bitcoin protocol and networking technology available scaling up the blocksize to respond to a 400x demand increase simply isn\'t possible in a decentralized system.\n\nFor instance if banks started using Bitcoin in a big way as a backend to settle global payments they might want 400x more transactions, they can afford it, and this might happen in a matter of months. Similarly I\'ve spoken to startups planning on doing things like on-blockchain futures exchanges that would need huge numbers of transactions to implement, yet each transaction is quite valuable - they\'d have the money to out-spend "regular" Bitcoin users on tx fees and have large volume needs. It\'d be quite easy to get ourselves into a position where there\'s nothing we can do about rising tx fees other than use Bitcoin differently and/or redesign the protocol at a fundamental level. It\'s best that we start understanding and moving towards that now rather than later.\n\n1) BTW /u/gavinandresen I know you made an arithmetic error in your original writeup where you came up with the 20MB number - the calculation actually resulted in a much lower number, 6MB IIRC.

I fully agree that an increase to 20 MB is just overkill and risky. If implemented well, it should be easier to scale to larger blocksizes after the first increase to 5 MB.\n\nAn increase of 1 MB per year seems a bit too small - if volume spikes, 2 MB blocks do not really help much. A linear increase also seems too slow for Bitcoin which can grow exponentially. An increase of 40% per year (amounting to close to doubling the max block size every two years) would be a good option IMO. The advantages of a gradual predefined increase are obvious: no sudden big increase, predictable, and no forking.\n\nSo, to 5 MB now, followed by a 40% per year increase.\n\n': 4, 'I have no idea who he is.

But in April, UN Secretary General Kofi Annan noted to the Security Council that accounts of the killings "warrant a more thorough investigation."\n\n> UN staffers in Afghanistan collected witness accounts of the massacres, visited mass graves of the victims and, in July, wrote a detailed 55-page report that they said was sent to Annan\'s office and to that of UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary Robinson.\n\n> Spokesmen for Annan and Robinson said Thursday that the UN investigation has been stymied by the Taliban.\n\n> UN staffers have collected accounts of each massacre, including names of many of those who conducted them and those killed. They note the roles played by Pakistanis and fighters with Osama bin Laden\'s Al Qaeda organization.\n\n> Based on details from hundreds of people who survived or who witnessed the massacres, as well as forensic work on grave sites, the report was written to provide the basis for a prosecution of Taliban leaders for crimes against humanity.\n\n> In 1998, when the Taliban captured the northern city of Mazar-e Sharif, they massacred hundreds of residents, "often shooting Hazaras in the street," according to Human Rights Watch. That massacre was seen as reprisal for a 1997 massacre by Hazaras of an estimated 2,000 surrendered Taliban fighters.\n\n> Other massacres reportedly took place in the villages of Bedmushkin and in Nayak. On Jan. 6 in Nayak, the report said, Taliban fighters in eight pickups entered the village. Over the next five hours, "the Taliban search party rounded up all of the males they could find." Taliban fighters eventually "shot them in firing squads."\n': 0, 'Glad someone investigated it further.

They must have imported a million BTC or more from the West in that year. (MtGOX\'s "lost" coins, I believe, were among them.)  It was that demand from China that created the November 2013 bubble, and probably also the April 2013 one.\n\nGuessing a mean price of 500 USD, that influx of bitcoins meant that, by the end of 2013, the Chinese buyers were preparing to hand out half a billion dollars of Chinese currency to the foreign sellers of those"worthless nothings" -- that they had imported without government license and without paying customs taxes.  The PBoC must have been quite unhappy at learning of that unexpected sinkhole opening under their economy and money supply; so its decrees and bank account closures in December 2013 are not surprising. \n\nAfter the PBoC intervention, bitcoin in China was reduced to a gambling game, confined to the exchanges; to mining bitcoins; and to making mining chips and rigs.  Unlike trading and investing, these were net exporting activities, that contributed positively to China\'s trade balance.  Again, it is not surprisig that there has been no government interference in these industries.\n\nThe Chinese day-traders seem to have been losing their love of bitcoin gradually but steadily since January 2014.  They must be selling their bitcoins to arbitragers in the Chinese exchanges, who move the coins to the West and sell them there.  Thus, the flow of money mentioned above has now partially reversed, returning by this route some part of that money.\n\nAs for mining, it seems that more than half of the hashpower is now in China.  Therefore,  about 500\'000 USD per day, or about 180 million USD per year, are now moving from the West to China by that route (in addition to the money of the sale of the 2013 bitcoins).  On the other hand, mining is consuming a lot of electricity; but possibly there is a surplus of that in China at the moment. \n\nMoreover, the Chinese also export mining equipment to the west; I don\'t know of any statistics, but the total so far must be in the hundreds of millions, too.\n\nIn conclusion: even though the Chinese government is quite unfriendly to bitcoin as a currency or investment, bitcoin is now making China richer, at the expense of the West.': 6, 'Sorry, I mistead your "wasn\'t" as "was".

We don\xe2\x80\x99t use bitcoin, we use the blockchain. And we don\xe2\x80\x99t use it just to say that we use the blockchain.

"We couldn\'t possibly do anything over the internet" is basically their response and in that light you can immediately see why they are being so stupid by automatically dismissing away bitcoin related technology. \n\nThe blockchain is not just about bitcoin. More properly it should be seen as really no different to a \'second layer\' of the internet that runs on it\'s own separate servers. Just like internet was back in the mid 90\'s, before it really took off with business and the general public - it may not have widespread public use just yet, but the base infrastructure is in place and the potential of its power is just waiting to be exploited.

All of that has been quite mature.\n\nAlthough it's a popular idea in the media these days, this is just false. While the blockchain is more than a payment system, it cannot run without bitcoin. (E-mail, while similar to bitcoin in some ways, is not required for the internet to work).\n\nThe reason we can trust that the blockchain cannot be forged is that an impractically high level of computing power would be required to tamper with it. The reason the level of computing power is so high is that computers running all over the world are competing to verify transactions. Why would anyone want to compete to verify transactions? They are rewarded by the protocol with bitcoins.\n\nThis idea being put forth in the media that the blockchain is good, but bitcoin is bad, is based on a lack of understanding of the technology. Certainly, the blockchain has many applications beyond bitcoin, but bitcoin is not some external application that can be separated out. \n\nIt's possible that the idea of separating bitcoin from the blockchain came about because of start-ups wanting to distance themselves from bitcoin, as a result of the distrust that has surrounded it during its infancy. \n\nThis negative perception is a result of many factors, including events such as the disappearance of the Mt. Gox coins and bitcoin's use in Silk Road. However, the Mt. Gox fiasco was an issue of a private company not being well-managed; you wouldn't blame the U.S. dollar if a private bank had lax security practices. In a similar way, you wouldn't blame the U.S. dollar when it's used to facilitate drug transactions, because it has many other legitimate uses. Perhaps this is what the interviewee of the article was attempting to explain.\n\nNo one has come up with a way to successfully launch a secure public ledger such as the blockchain without a backing cryptocurrency such as bitcoin.
