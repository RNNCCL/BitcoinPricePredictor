What do you think happens when there is no more room for extra transactions? Will bitcoin\'s value still rise? \n\nNo one really knows for sure what will happen. If enough people can give up on using Bitcoin completely without being important to Bitcoins value then everything could be fine. But again, how do you know?

It might SEEM like it increases security, but in reality, increased fees=reduced transaction count, which reduces the demand for mining, because people will use the network less, or for who who would have been new, not even try it at all.  We miners have enough incentive.  Don\'t buy into the \'I need to ROI before everyone else\' hype.\n\nBitcoin and bitcoin are not only PRODUCTS, but a DYNAMIC economy.  ALL economies are DYNAMIC in nature, because they are driven by PEOPLE.\n\nIn my opinion, the most effective short term and long term solution, (which does introduce risks, there\'s no such thing as a perfect system), would be a Dynamic blocksize, (if softcap 2MB within prior 20 minutes, blocksizelimit 2GB), accompanied with a fee ROLLBACK, and ELIMINATE the ability for miners to choose their blocks based on size.

My own post is going to have some bias as well, but at least I can balance things out in favor of small blocks. (I am a \'small block\' supporter, I believe blocks should be as big as possible, but that \'as big as possible\' is currently well below 4mb).\n\nWhy people want big blocks:\n\n+ 1mb blocks are not enough to scale to a global payment network, even with improvements such as lighting\n+ 1mb blocks are filling up today, it\'s only a matter of time (6-20 weeks probably) before most blocks are full and transactions with low fees are going to be orphaned indefinitely\n+ Full blocks and high-required fees are disruptive to the user experience.\n\nAs far as I\'m aware, those are the only legitimate reasons. And they are very good reasons, they are also all correct.\n\nWhy people want small blocks:\n\n+ Bigger blocks cause miner centralization\n+ Bigger blocks make it more expensive to run a full node.\n+ Bitcoin is growing exponentially, and a simple increase to 2mb is unlikely to buy a whole lot of time\n+ Raising the block size is a hardfork, which breaks compatibility with all existing nodes, which means anyone who doesn\'t upgrade can get abused\n\nThat\'s a very brief TL;DR of the problem, but the problems are significant. They are also unintuitive for someone unfamiliar with the technical details behind distributed systems. Most people opposing big blocks are not doing it because they want a fee market, and are not doing it because they want to encourage things like Lightning.\n\n> Why is this issue so controvertial\n\nMany people view the small blocks as a life-and-death problem for Bitcoin. Small blocks = dead Bitcoin, at least that\'s what some people believe.\n\nAnd many people view big blocks as a life-and-death problem for Bitcoin. Big blocks = 1 or 2 mining firms = slight improvment over paypal = \'dead\' Bitcoin. And they also tend to disagree that a fee market is going to kill Bitcoin. It\'s a bit of an oxymoron. "Nobody uses Bitcoin, the fees are too high because there are too many transactions". \n\n> How is a concern about decentralization of Bitcoin related to this\n\nIt\'s actually the primary concern of most people in the \'small blocks\' crowd. Feel free to ask for more details (gotta dash soon), but basically having large blocks heavily favors larger miners, and makes it very difficult for smaller players to get into the game. If you need premium internet to the tune of $1000s per month, that\'s $1000s per month that you aren\'t spending on hashpower. As a small miner, $1000s per month is a much bigger percentage of your operation than a big miner, who is going to be spending more or less the same amount on their internet connection.\n\nAnd it all comes down to orphan rate. Bigger blocks cause bigger orphan rates, and bigger miners can devote more money (at a constant percentage of their expenditures) to driving their orphan rate down. Which means that each dollar spent on hashing equipment is going farther. This is in addition to the economies of scale that larger miners already enjoy. There\'s very obviously a limit to how big blocks can be before causing miner centralization disaster, and the debate is more about whether that number is 1mb or 2mb or 20mb, and if we can scale to 8gb blocks over the next 20 years or not.\n\nMost of the people actively involved in development and actively looking at the stresses on the network feel that 4mb is too much. They also all feel that 1.75mb (segwit) is okay, which is why the segwit proposal is not seeing basically any opposition. (it also helps that segwit is a soft fork, and that segwit does *substantially* more than just raise the effective blocksize, bringing in a bunch of optimizations  such as eliminating txn malleability, enabling schnorr signatures, and adding a key component to the lightning network)\n\n> How does this issue relate to the LN?\n\nThe lightning network improves the scalability of Bitcoin by a huge factor. Depending on how it ends up getting used, we\'re talking anything from a 5x to a 5000x improvement. Basically, it allows people to connect to the Bitcoin network with just a few transactions, and then they can *instantly* and *fully securely* make transactions with *anyone else on the lighting network*, *as many transactions as they want*. So it\'s a huge deal, and people are very excited to see it happen. Most merchants today use centralized providers such as BitPay. Lighting would allow merchants to reap all of the same benefits, but in a decentralized way.\n\nPeople keep bringing up the lightning network because it reduces the blocksize requirement for world-domination from something like 500 GB to something more like 300MB. It\'s still a huge gap from the 1MB we have today, but it yields a huge runway for finding more improvements.': 3, "*is not seeing any opposition from the technical community.\n\nWas surprised to see all the comments against segwit, but they seemed to be concerned about two things:\n\n+ Blockstream thinks its a good idea\n+ its not big enough\n+ Its not tested very well\n\nThe first complaint is nonsense. Just because Blockstream likes something is not grounds for it being bad. If you have a complaint, please complain based on technical merit.\n\nThe second complaint furthers my point. Everybody thinks that 1.75mb is not too large.\n\nThe third point is largely unfounded, but it will take time to get segwit from where it currently is (implemented, tested well but not Bitcoin-well, also I think missing SPV stuff) to deployed.\n\nI've yet to see a strong technical argument against segwit.": 2, "Block size is a non-problem.

People buying in late 2013 have only waited a little over two years now for a return on investment. That\'s high in comparison to 2011 to 2013, maybe, but not for a maturing commodity. As Bitcoin trades like a commodity, that\'s hardly any time at all.\n\nIf you\'re not familiar with or comfortable trading commodities like copper, oil, or gold, you should be looking at the other features of Bitcoin and not treating it like an investment vehicle. You\'ll ultimately end up being the weak hands that trades too soon, IMHO.\n\nThere were a lot of people in early 2012 who were envious of the guys who bought at $2 during the late 2011 fall in price.

Don\'t quit your day job when the price doubles. Don\'t even quit it when the price quintuples, you\'re going to have to pay taxes, and the gains really aren\'t such that you can bank on them.

Ask any startup that has had to scale their operations. Scaling is not as simple as rasing the 'max requests per second' limit in Apache, if you do that your servers are going to crash and your users are going to see a 'Reddit is down, try refreshing in a few minutes' message. Scaling usually means buying more servers, and adjusting the code so that it's fast and so that there is sane load balancing between the servers.\n\nBitcoin is the same way. If you take a strategy of just rasing the limit to match demand, you are going to strain the network and cause heavy centralization by limiting who is able to mine profitably and by limiting who can run a full node. There is no relationship between the practical capacity of the Bitcoin network and the number of users.\n\nThe actual capacity of the Bitcoin network is highly contended. But most of the core devs (as demonstrated by widespread support for segwit from the technical team) believe that it's somewhere between 1mb and 4mb, and that 1.75mb is safe but 8mb is not.\n\nScaling Bitcoin is not about raising the block size. It's about finding out how to safely increase the effective throughput of the network. Lightning Network is a good example of a major boost that does not require raising the blocksize to substantially increase the effective throughput substantially.\n\nThe heavy optimizations in libsecp2561k allow faster verification, which reduces the orphan rate for miners. Because the target orphan rate is constant, a reduced orphan rate means increased safety for larger blocks down the road.\n\nThe research going into weak blocks and IBLTs is also promising to substantially reduce the orphan rate, perhaps enough to safely increase the blocksize by a factor of 4 or more. This is scaling.\n\nThere is nothing that guarantees that scaling will keep up with demand, and in fact I think it's extremely likely that it will not.

Having a middle ground between SPV and a full node would help reduce the number of SPV clients.
