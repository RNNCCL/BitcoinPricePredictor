We\'ve had cultural revolutions before, and there have been plenty of people working outside the system. There have also been plenty of instances of people being outside radicals at first, but then taking over and proving to be no better than their predecessors; cases like MtGox certainly show that as a group we\'re not much better. What matters is that crypto now has a perfect storm:\n\n1. Political and economic circumstances helping to drive a cultural revolution (of which I suppose "Bitcoin kids" are a part)\n2. A genuinely interesting new technology\n3. A built-in monetization mechanism\n\nEither of those would have failed on its own, and two out of three only make moderate impact. Just (1) was Occupy Wall Street. Just (2) is something like Tahoe-LAFS (which is awesome tech, but clearly has not caught on). (1) + (2) would be something like torrents on the good side and Diaspora on the bad side, and (2) + (3) would be most of Silicon Valley.\n\nCryptocurrency has the radical decentralist roots of cy(b|ph)erpunk culture, but the reason why it has succeeded so much where everything else has relatively failed is that there\'s money involved, which gives people license to pursue it as a full-time job, and not just an altruistic side-project. Strategies like token sales and namespace sales (something which has not been tried yet, but really should) are also a powerful addition, because you can now for the first time monetize decentralized technologies without having to relegate yourself to the (IMO vastly insufficient) tactic of "selling services". This alone means that something like Diaspora is 10x more likely to succeed now than it would 5 years ago. And the combination of personal wealth, community wealth (we all profit from BTC going up) and the all-important factor of ideology creates a combined set of incentives basically touching every part of Maslow\'s hierarchy, driving more people to participate.\n\nThe fact that this involves trust-free technologies is very important. If this was simply a matter of "stop trusting those corrupt and boring Beltway types, trust us wonderful people from Shenzhen and San Francisco", then the crypto revolution would be nice for 10 years but then eventually degrade into being the same old thing. The fact that this is a technology, and the point of the technology is to create a new foundation that allows individuals to be in control of their own digital and financial identities, is crucial in preventing that from happening.

He couldn't save them all, and so he'd come to a decision. He would let the first capsule fail. This much is clear, he kept it a secret.\n\nThe second capsule was practically as bad as the first. Constantly malfunctioning, boiling off liquid nitrogen. But Bob kept it going. Then a few years later, he had to leave town for a week. He paid a groundskeeper $100 to babysit the capsule, and the pump broke. And when the groundskeeper called a company to fix it, they never showed.\n\nI came back, drove up to the vault, looked at the capsule. There's a nozzle that comes out of the capsule that has steam, visible, because the liquid nitrogen is evaporating away. And when I drove up and I looked, that steam wasn't there. So I just didn't want to acknowledge what that meant. But the test was to go and touch that pipe. And if it was cold, then there was some hope. That meant that it was still cold inside.\n\nAnd then, going through my mind, what if it's hot? What if those bodies have decomposed? So I walk up to the capsule. I put my finger on it. And it was like touching a hot frying pan. It was the most painful, emotional experience of my life. I had failed that little girl. I promised her dad.

He probably described the decision somewhere, but I don't recall it at the moment.\n\nIt's probably easier for rounding issues. I guess it's also easier for miners' short-term calculations when not approaching the halving event. It's also a bit more elegant of a solution, I suppose.\n\nOr perhaps he worried that with a constant rate of change, it would be easier for the community to argue over what the number should be and attempt to change it.
