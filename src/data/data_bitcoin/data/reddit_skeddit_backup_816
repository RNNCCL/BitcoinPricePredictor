Antonopoulos educates Senate of Canada about Bitcoin (Oct 8, ENG)", http://youtu.be/xUNGFZDO8mM\n\nThis video is an extremely informed, sober discussion of Bitcoin technology and the issues of regulation. It is long (>90 mins) and is primarily a frank Q&A. I believe within minutes you will see that this is well worth your time if you would like to understand the impact of the proposed regulation. \n\nSirs, in my opinion and that of others, the current framework threatens the privacy of virtual currency users, innovators, and researchers and will stifle innovation, harming the State of New York and its citizens in particular.\n\nIn my opinion:\n\n1.\tThe BitLicense far too broad, requiring licenses for far more than just money services. This first and foremost represents regulatory overreach. \n\n2.\tIt infringes on the privacy rights of individual users. Companies that obtain a BitLicense could be forced to collect identifying data on account holders and end users including full name and physical address. This information will be kept on file for 10 years in case the government seeks it. So while individual users may not need a BitLicense, their privacy will be seriously affected. History has proven that when personal information is aggregated in a database, it becomes an easy target.\n\n3.\tIt forces virtual currency innovators to undergo rigorous background checks and submit fingerprints to state and federal law enforcement. This will create a barrier to entry for start ups and inventors looking to create new services. For example it could even prevent educators from offering classes on cryptocurrency theory and practice by requiring any student who touches related software code to undergo such onerous procedures or risk committing a violation of law. \n\n4.\tThe proposal as written raises clear and substantial First Amendment concerns.\n\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s premature to craft regulations for an industry that\xe2\x80\x99s so new and still in flux. Bitcoin and similar virtual currencies are still in their infancy, and we are already seeing technological solutions that would render certain regulations obsolete. Clearly it is far more desirable to allow technology instead of government to solve problems where possible. This regulatory proposal could cut that innovation off at the knees, before we have a chance to see the potential societal benefits.\n\nNY DFS should respect the privacy of technology users, and limit its regulation to what is proportionate to the real threat at hand, and must target only those who might seek to abuse the technology rather than treating all who use it as suspect. \n\nSincerely,\nTsontar ': 11, 'Considering how many sites have had FULL database leaks, including Bitcoin sites, the record keeping part of this regulation is a bigger threat to users than any protections it is intended to provide.': 57, 'Harder to spam filter letters.

For example.. the recent Fed meeting recordings with Goldman Sachs showed that the regulatory agency did little in actual regulation of a too-big-to-fail financial giant whose maneuvers in 2006-2008 threatened the entire financial state of the world. Meanwhile, every Bitcoin entrepreneur who has any sort of publicized success has been harassed by multiple agencies and tied down in ongoing legal proceedings.. Bitstamp.. Coinbase.. Winklevoss Twins.. even MtGox had $5million seized from them by the DHS before they reportedly did anything wrong.

It is intended to limit Bitcoin to a niche market and make it difficult to adopt.

For example, imagine if there was a group of people experimenting with and starting companies surrounding a newly-discovered form of hallucinogenic substance that has not had enough time to be classified as illegal. If you were a member of such a community, you might refer to yourselves as "hallucinogenic substance users" under the impression that it was quite legal and participation in the community was simply an expression of your creativity and an outlet for innovation. However, because of the obvious negative connotation that follows that sort of stuff, you\'re already admitting guilt in a way. Similarly, a group labeled "virtual currency users" might not necessarily be perceived as harmless or aboveboard, especially considering how easily drugs, hitmen, etc can be acquired with virtual currency. As a result, it seems like you\'re asking for favors for criminals (which you are not, but legislators may not feel the same way).\n\nIt might be helpful to do one of two things: either don\'t assume that referring to the group as "virtual currency users" is a safe thing to do, or better yet, include an introductory blurb about how much good virtual currency can do and why those who use it do so from a position that is legally and ethically defensible.\n\nJust my two cents.': 2, "> Coinbase has great functionality, but unfortunately it does adhere to some pretty hardcore KYC rules : linking bank accounts and such.\n\nPrecisely.

Give it a read and let's talk it over.\n\n==\n\n### Welcome to Bitcoin! \n\nYou\xe2\x80\x99ve probably been hearing a lot recently about Bitcoin and are wondering what the big deal is.  Nothing quite like Bitcoin has ever existed before so it is difficult for a lot of people to conceptualize what it is exactly.  This is mainly due to the fact that it functions as a combination of many things simultaneously (some of which had never existed before!).  \n\n#### Quick overview\n\nAt its core Bitcoin is a combination of the following;\n\n* **Digital currency** (think electronic cash controlled only by you)\n* **Digital asset/commodity** (think stocks, bonds, etc.)\n* **A deflationary store of wealth** (think gold, or a bank account controlled by you)\n* **A worldwide payment mechanism** (think credit cards and wire transfers, such as Visa, MasterCard, or Western Union)\n* **A protocol for trustless consensus known as the Blockchain**  This is probably the most important function of bitcoin and was considered an impossible computer science problem until Bitcoin solved it (see [Byzantines Generals Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault_tolerance) for further info).  This unique solution is enabling bitcoin to rapidly become a new protocol for value transfer on the internet similar to how TCP/IP or HTTP are used as information transfer protocols.  This protocol will allow for thousands of new applications including smart contracts, asset swaps, Distributed Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), smart law, verifiable voting, etc. that are only beginning to be developed.  \n\nSome fundamental properties of Bitcoin that make it different from other forms of money;\n\n* Total supply cap of 21 Million Bitcoins.  Each Bitcoin however is easily divisible.  A unit breakdown is as follows; \n1 Bitcoin (symbol BTC or XBT) = 1,000,000 microbitcoins/ubits/bits = 100,000,000 satoshis.\nYou can think about bits & satoshis how you think of dollars & cents (1 bit = 100 satoshis) as the primary transactional units for Bitcoin.\n\n* Open source.  The bitcoin software is [openly available on GitHub](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin) for anyone to review, audit, clone, or contribute towards development.  \n\n* Decentralized.  Bitcoin uses peer-to-peer technology to operate without the need for any third party middleman.  This significantly reduces fees associated with normal payment networks (PayPal, Visa, bank wire, etc.) from 2-3%+ to less than 1%.  At the same time decentralization makes it highly resilient (see [antifragile]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifragile)) as there is no central point of failure and the protocol can be updated as needed to address any issues that arise.\n\n* Irreversible.  Once a Bitcoin payment is sent and confirmed by the network there is no way to undo the transaction.  This is a big bonus for merchants as it eliminates chargebacks.  Buyers however should make sure that the party they are transacting with is reputable before sending payment.\n\n#### Have questions?  \n\nThis guide tries to address the most common and important concepts below but if you want to learn more the [FAQ of the Wiki](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Faq) is a great resource as is [Bitcoin.org](https://bitcoin.org/en/).  If you need some 1 on 1 help check out the friendly folks at /r/bitcoinbeginners.\n\n#### How do I buy Bitcoins?\n\nFirst off, you can buy any amount of bitcoin (from as little as $5 worth) but never buy more than you would be willing to lose, there are no guarantees that bitcoin will rise in value or even exist in the future although cryptocurrencies in general seem like they are here to stay and bitcoin has a lot of advantages over its competitors.  \n\n* **US:** [Coinbase.com](https://coinbase.com/) (for linking your bank account), [Mycelium mobile wallet](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mycelium.wallet) with localtrader or [Localbitcoins.com](https://localbitcoins.com/) (for buying with cash and extra anonymity).  \n\n* **Non-US:** [Mycelium](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mycelium.wallet), [Localbitcoins.com](https://localbitcoins.com/), [Bitstamp](https://www.bitstamp.net/), [Bitfinex](https://www.bitfinex.com/), [btc-e]( https://btc-e.com/), [Kraken](https://www.kraken.com/), [Vault of Satoshi](https://www.vaultofsatoshi.com/), [Cavirtex](https://www.cavirtex.com/home), etc. \n\n* **China:**  [OK Coin](https://www.okcoin.com/), [Huobi]( https://www.huobi.com/), [BTC China]( https://vip.btcchina.com/)\n\n**Note:** Only keep coins on an exchange that are going to be used for trading, if you are just purchasing coins make sure to transfer them to your personal wallet (your private key) immediately after purchase, and make sure your wallet is encrypted.  A good rule of thumb is that if you are not the sole possessor of your private keys you don\xe2\x80\x99t own the bitcoins.  If you leave your coins on the exchanges you are essentially accepting an IOU from the exchange for your coins as they are the ones holding your private keys.  \n\n#### Where can I spend my Bitcoins?\n\n* [Coinmap.org](http://coinmap.org/) local businesses accepting bitcoins\n* [Overstock.com](http://www.overstock.com/) everything under the sun\n* [Gyft.com]( http://www.gyft.com/) thousands of retailers such as Amazon, Target, Whole Foods, CVS, Home Depot, Sears, etc.\n* [Tigerdirect.com](http://www.tigerdirect.com/) all your electronic needs\n\n#### Can I mine bitcoin?\n\nAnyone can mine for Bitcoins but you will most likely operate at a loss unless you have free electricity and are very knowledgeable about mining in general.  It is advised for newcomers to stay away from mining and leave it to the professionals unless you are just interested in it as a hobby and not with the intention of turning a profit.  If you want to learn more about mining you can read more [here](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Faq#Mining).  \n\n#### General Security\n\nUse 2 Factor Authentication (2FA) everywhere it is offered (mobile wallet, exchange, email, etc.).  Google Authenticator and Authy are two great apps for handling 2FA. It's important to keep a backup of your 2FA tokens in case your phone gets lost.\n\n* [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2), \n* [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-authenticator/id388497605?mt=8)   \n\nMobile wallets are good for storing as much cash as you would be comfortable carrying in your physical wallet, for convenient \xe2\x80\x9con the go\xe2\x80\x9d spending at retailers, etc.  \n\nBitcoin intended for \xe2\x80\x9csavings\xe2\x80\x9d should be kept in an offline wallet (also known as cold storage or paper wallet).  Instructions on how to set up offline wallets can be found [here](http://www.coindesk.com/information/paper-wallet-tutorial/).  At a minimum you should disconnect your computer from the internet when generating offline wallets but ideally you should be running on a clean operating system as well (either a computer that has never & will never be online or by booting into a [LiveUSB](http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/create-a-usb-stick-on-windows) linux system).  \n\n**Note:** Do not use brainwallets unless you are an expert, they are known to be vulnerable to theft unless set up correctly.\n\n#### Mobile Wallets\n\n* [Coinbase.com](https://coinbase.com/) is the easiest for newcomers and is generally trusted but be aware that they hold your private keys so if they ever disappeared for any reason you would have no recourse for recovering your coins.\n\n* [Mycelium](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mycelium.wallet) has a nice interface and allows you to store your private keys so they can\xe2\x80\x99t run away with your coins.  They also have a great local trader feature for finding other people who want to buy & sell bitcoin in your area.\n\n* [Blockchain]( https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=piuk.blockchain.android) allows you to store your private keys and is well respected in the community.  \n\n#### Desktop Wallets\n\n* [Multibit](https://multibit.org/)\n* [Electrum](https://electrum.org/)\n* [Amory](https://bitcoinarmory.com/)\n\n#### Tipping\n\n* [Changetip](https://www.changetip.com/) for tipping on reddit (/u/changetip), twitter (@changetip) and github (@changetip) with more coming soon!\n* [Quickcoin](http://www.quickcoin.co/) for tipping easily on Facebook\n\n#### News sites & additional resources\n\n* [Coindesk](http://www.coindesk.com/) for bitcoin related news\n* [Tradeblock](https://tradeblock.com/) for news, markets and mining.  \n\nThe [Whitepaper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf) that started it all by none other than Satoshi Nakamoto himself!\nStill haven't been able to get your question answered?

It is different for Credit Cards vs Bitcoins.\n\nAll 'Checkout' does is provide you with a front end to use to collect payment information and turn that data into a 'token'. \n\nWith credit cards, it provides you with a card token. If you choose to let 'Checkout' both **authorize and capture** a charge then there isn't really much you need to do on the backend to get your money, if you only authorized a charge then at some point in the future your backend needs to capture the funds by using the card token that Stripe returned through 'Checkout'.\n\nWith Bitcoins, once the customer completes the 'Checkout' form you are given a BTC receiver token that must then be redeemed through Stripe's API in order to retrieve the payment. Once you have a receiver token in hand you are assured that the funds are available to Stripe and by redeeming the token Stripe will transfer the funds into your Stripe account. With Stripe Checkout and Bitcoins you absolutely have to redeem the 'recevier token' with their API in order to get your funds.

I live in Canada but work online earning in USD, which arrives via cheque. Until just recently, I would take the cheques to a nearby ATM, deposit the cheques, and after a few days they would show up in my USD denominated account, and 30 days after that the hold would be lifted and I could move the funds around as necessary. Not the most efficient system, but it worked reliably well.\n\nThen the bank fucked up, so I decided fuck the banks. After making a deposit a little over a month ago, the funds showed up in my account as usual, but then were suddenly removed. I called the bank to ask "what up" to which they replied they had no idea and that I would have to go into the branch, which is an hour away, and ask in person what\'s going on. So I do that, and guess what, they have no idea either. They say sorry, wait a month and see if the funds come back. Just a couple grand missing and no explanation why, just another day at the bank I suppose. So I wait, and after a month nothing shows up, so I call up the bank, and after yelling my way up the supervisor chain, we finally get to the answer that you\'re not supposed to deposit USD cheques in ATM\'s. Doesn\'t matter that the cheques I had deposited since the whole fiasco had began had gone through as normal, but these particular cheques had somehow offended my HSBC money overlords. So the cheques were now being sent back to their respective companies, rather than back to me to deposit elsewhere, so now I need to contact about 4 different companies and try to get them to recut my cheques. I\'ll probably be able to get it all sorted out, but I\'m just fed up with this whole situation where I\'m supposedly paying my bank to protect my money and make it easily accessible, but then when my money goes missing they don\'t know or care about it. So, I went into the bank one last time, withdrew a few months cash reserve, and transferred everything else into bitcoin.\n\nNow, I have a bank in the states that allows mobile cheque deposit, so I scan in my cheques, a few days later the funds are fully available, transfer them into bitcoin, and then use bitcoin to pay off my MasterCard through Circle. My rental complex allows payment by MasterCard, so we live entirely on that and then immediately pay it off with the income, and put the rest into cold storage.\n\nIt\'s hugely liberating switching to bitcoin only; I never have to worry about how the bank could screw me over when I most need them. It\'s crazy even to think that this entire work around wouldn\'t even be possible a year ago, and I think next year it will be even easier.

These practices are constantly being used all while the CPI keeps climbing. This compounds the problem where your dollar buy less than it did a 1, 5, 10, 50, 100 years ago. Doing this kind of stuff, politicians sell the myth of unending economic growth for all and promote a fake form of free market capitalism while maintaining the power, influence and wealth for themselves and their corporate owners. See, you & I? Fucked.\n\nAnd all political leaders want it this way. The population is sold out & fucked all the while convinced its for their own good. Equal blame is laid upon the "leaders" of our society and those that voted them there.

The conference was in need of BTC in order to move forward successfully.\n\nThe conference organizers reached out to me, Sam and Brock. They asked for sponsorship and for us to invest $140,000 into the conference so it could go forward. We believe in the organizers of the conference (Paul, Steven, Raphael and all those volunteering to make it happen) and wanted to see it be successful and thus agreed to help.\n\nWe got 14% of the equity between the three of us (Sam, Brock and myself) in exchange for $140,000 and a few sponsorship spots for that and future conferences (I gave a sponsor spot to BitAngels, but the BitAngels as a group were not involved in the investment) this was a personal investment for me.\n\nThe conference went forward and had 700+ attendees, great speeches, and produced great technical talks, which were all recorded and shared with the broader Bitcoin community.\n\nSo yes, Brock, Sam and I stood up and helped out a community run event when others sponsors were flaking out.
