I get shit for pushing fundamental / efficient market-driven stuff, like your classic CAPM stochastic motion type stuff I assume you're thinking about.": 1, 'Well it\'s kind of like digital gold you can keep in your pocket and send anywhere. The price fluctuates like gold, but because everything is digital is can go up and down with a little more regularity. What makes it like gold is that there is a limited amount of coins that will ever be created (21 million) and many a few million of those 21 million are lost/seized/stolen already. Gold is valuable because there\'s demand and it\'s seen to retain value. People have that same trust in Bitcoin.\n\nIt\'s both B2C and C2C because both companies and consumers can use this to pay for goods, or companies can use it to move their funds around with verifiable proofs that the transaction was done. If I refund a customer I can point to a transaction on the blockchain and tell them it was done and prove it was done. If I\'m a company and I need to send money to a contractor overseas, I can send a bitcoin transaction and it will cost pennies and take an hour or two instead of days and losing 25% in the process, or paying wire fees. \n\nIn regards to stability, we\'re still in the unknown. Most people think the price is going to go up as the coins become harder and more expensive to mine. The "halvening" is also coming in the next year and the issuance rate of bitcoin will drop from 25 every 10 minutes to 12.5 per ten minutes. 70% of all coins that will EVER exist have been mined this week and 90% of them will be mined by the 2030\'s. Bitcoin is an experiment and unless some of the underlying tech issues (see: blocksize debate) it could easily fail and go to zero. On the other hand there\'s millions invested from some big names in tech into the Blockchain technology and bitcoin at large. If bitcoin failed it would be like an sector of the economy going belly up. I\'m optimitic (as are many others) that this will not happen. \n\nThe cost of creating a bitcoin changes over time. The "difficulty" of the neverending bitcoin equation that the mining network is trying to solve gets harder. (https://bitcoinwisdom.com/bitcoin/difficulty) the difficulty gets higher as more miners connect and work on solving the hashes that the network generates. I\'d ask a miner, but I think it costs around $180-$200 to create each coin depending on your mining setup and electricity costs. I\'m not an expert in that field. \n\nIn regards to the consumer base development we\'ve had VC\'s generate over 600 million (source: http://www.coindesk.com/state-of-bitcoin-q1-2015-record-investment-buoys-ecosystem/) and more to come. Some weeks we see another 50 million raised. We see banks and companies looking into the blockchain separately or Bitcoin as a whole. Various companies large and small accept it. Of course, you can also buy drugs with it. \n\nThere are people holding (or hodling as the saying goes) and some people spend. I feel that some people do a bit of both like I do. I spend a few bits a week, but a save anything I can in my long term storage. People have used bitcoin to buy and sell homes, tesla cars, normal cars, and other properties. I\'d look through /r/bitcoins "top posts" through the years and see what pops up. But people feel just as safe taking Bitcoin as they do taking cash, if not safer. Long term most people think it\'s going to yield a boon for them and it\'s safer than cash if you take the proper security precautions. \n\nFrauds, that\'s a longgggggg answer. Especially after the 2013 boom we saw a variety of companies come out of the woodworks trying to get people to send them bitcoin. I\'m sure you can google a lot of them under "bitcoin fraud" or "bitcoin scam". Some of them are services promising to double your coins, others were cloud mining firms, and others were alt coins, which were simple pump and dump bitcoin clones trying to cash in on the optimism from the $1200 per coin Bitcoin run of 2013. To prevent fraud a lot of companies have come up with their own private methods of preventing it. I\'d ask Coinbase, Purse, or Bitstamp to see what they do but I doubt they will tell you. Most of these companies build relationships with you and only let you do a certain amount of business with them until your prove you\'re a good spender and play by the rules.\n\nBitcoin is both fraud proof and fraud friendly. No one can steal your coins unless they have your private key. But once the coins are gone....they\'re gone. There\'s no take backsies. There\'s no chargebacks. For merchants it\'s a great deal, for customers it can be difficult. \n\nIn regards to the liquidity, there\'s only going to be 21 million ever created. That\'s your liquidity. I think we\'re at 14 million or so right now and more created every ten minutes. The general community belief is that when the coins stop flowing heavily like they are now, the price will rise. But that is all speculation.Bitcoin is an experiment.\n\nIt\'s worth noting that the Silk Road bitcoin auction is coming up and the 44,000 coins are going to sell for a few million dollars. There will be bidders paying above market price for them and if there was no belief in bitcoin, no one would be buying them. \n\nThe short answer is no one knows what is going to happen over the next 50 years. But we\'re all in the ride to the moon and we\'re optimistic for the most part. \n\nI hope this answers some of your questions. Welcome to Bitcoin. \n\nI invite others to critique this reply, I\'m sure there\'s examples I\'ve missed and things I didn\'t explain fully. I banged this entire summary out while I was at work and rushed :p\n\nYou can DM me if you want further information.

I don\'t understand how people spend time debating it. Does anyone say Tesla\'s car production is volatile?

You cannot judge bitcoin in a few months interval. Right now, there is just not enough data to make any reliable predictions (current data suggest success). If you use 1 year as an interval (this is a minimum), you only have 5-6 data points.\n\nIf bitcoin becomes widespread - its price will grow in bubbles.

The withdrawal did go through to that address. Purse.io uses P2SH addresses (assuming multisig) that sends the change to a new P2SH address after each withdrawal. If you click through that chain you can track over 30 bitcoins that were withdrawn today. With some deeper digging and more unauthorized withdrawal addresses you could account for more.\n\n\nIf Purse.io is claiming that all funds are safe I call that bluff.

In fact physical cash is far less traceable than bitcoin and the authorities control money laundering perfectly fine with it.

Are you claiming that p1 <= p2?\n\nAlso, even if the government doesn't believe you bought the bitcoins in 2010 with cash and even if you have to lie and say that the wallet you used was on an old computer that you threw away so you no longer have the private keys, your risk of suffering consequences from the government if you transfer drug money directly from the dark market to Coinbase is higher than if you use the Bitcoins from 2010 story.

It\'s pretty fundamental about cash that it doesn\'t have a memory. When you pay for something in a store, the clerk does not ask where the $10 bill came from. This fungibility is fundamental. Even putting aside political questions, imagine the extra costs involved if each dollar bill\'s history had to be checked every time it was used. Consider the horrible extent to which underprivileged people are blocked from engaging in commerce just because of where they live, because we don\'t have this kind of memoryless money online. Consider the invasiveness of privacy and vulnerability to hacking that comes from credentialed financial accounts being stored in corporate databases. Etc.\n\nParticipating in coinjoin transactions is a way to make it more true that bitcoin is like cash. That\'s the main reason I do it. I\'d argue that just the fact that coinjoin is **possible** is a hugely important fact - it means that tracing coin history in the blockchain is probabilistic rather than deterministic, and in some cases it\'s basically impossible.\n\nIf you want Bitcoin to be a real digital money, support coinjoin in whatever form. If you believe that money should be entirely under the control of the state, that all your purchases should be censorable and controllable by corporations and governments and you should not have personal freedom and rights, then by all means support "AML" and campaign to end physical cash :)\n\nOn your last point: Makers can connect over Tor, although I think the main reason to do so is to bolster security.\n': 14, 'Ah, good, that clarifies [your earlier answer](https://www.reddit.com/r/joinmarket/comments/3dv04i/since_all_the_participants_of_a_joinmarket/ct8ym99?context=2) that caused my misconception.

It's an even better idea to first make a backup of your wallet.\n\nI really hate the term wallet, though, when it comes to bitcoin. It's a bit of a misnomer. Your wallet doesn't hold money. It holds keys that unlock the money. Always be aware that these keys must be securely guarded. If you lose them, your bitcoins are gone forever. If someone else (in real life or over the internet) sees them, they can make a copy of the keys and steal your bitcoin.\n\nAll that said, if you are confident that your private bitcoin keys are safe and secure, go ahead and send a small transaction to one of the addresses that your wallet generated. Your wallet software should almost instantly see the transaction incoming. Then give it an hour or so to be confirmed into the blockchain. You can verify that the transaction was successful by checking the balance on that address using a web-based block explorer such as [https://blockexplorer.com/](https://blockexplorer.com/). Oh, and make sure you use the recommended fee. There is a chance your transaction won't get processed if the fee is too low. If you buy your bitcoin from Coinbase, they pay the mining fee for you.\n\nHave fun! Just remember it's still the pioneer days of Bitcoin. It's far from fool proof and easy to goof up and lose money if you don't stay cautious.

Like I said, introducing smart contracts on the backend doesn\'t solve the issue here because fish play for the experience, not for "reusable unbreakable contracts." There has to be that layer that markets to player base, and that layer will always be laid out in comparison next to DK/FD/whoever in terms of usability, experience etc. Whether that\'s a category error on the part of the consumer or not, I don\'t know but it\'s what\'ll happen and that layer assumes the profit motive, I\'d imagine.

The point is that it seems to these companies (and to me) that the demand for instant BTC withdrawals doesn't exist enough to justify that route.\n\nHere's why: the players who do care about getting their winnings quickly (BTC or not) are gamblers who don't want to take another spin, which is bad not just directly for the site in terms of lost rake but also for the sharks who themselves pay a massively disproportionate amount of fees in return for access to the fish in the pool. Sharks also tend to play more professionally/predictably so there's no particular rush for them to get paid instantly; not to mention that most if not all sharks keep bankrolls with the site anyway (DFS is UIGEA legal so it's not like they have to worry about the custodial risk of a Black Friday raid; this is a reason that online poker is a much better example of a BTC use case than DFS is). Now maybe enough of them will be convinced that being able to cash out with BTC would be worth the potential damage to the player pool; maybe you can convince them and then they can tell DK/FD that it needs to happen. But all things being equal, keeping a shark happy is much, much, much more important than keeping a fish happy. And keeping a fish playing is much more important than keeping a fish happy. Now of course there's the case where enough DFS fish demand quick BTC withdrawals and threaten to leave that it threatens the sharks' ROI, but it would take a huge critical mass of demand that just doesn't seem to be there. Winning gamblers tend to keep playing.": 2, '>technically there\'s no reason a competitor can\'t duplicate a social betting site and not have any restrictions\n\nUS AML laws don\'t just go away because you left the US. If part of your business plan is "don\'t get caught by our customers\' government" then you\'re going to run into problems sooner or later. \n\n>Bitcoin will fuel that site and it will eat FD/DK \'eventually\'.\n\nSee the thing is I don\'t know what evidence you have that warrants continuing on to make a claim like this. Why will this hypothetical anonymous daily fantasy provider "eat" FD/DK? What is the market dynamic that incentivizes an American (shark or fish) to pull their USD from FD/DK and send BTC to this other firm? It can\'t just be cheaper rake or (a.) it\'ll work at first and you\'ll get starved out by a bigger firm in a price war or (b.) the site is sketchy enough that it\'s hard for people to take seriously even with cheap rake (SwC). Under (a.) even if using BTC means profitably undercutting them, at some point they start subsidizing with their balance sheet and either you raise capital to do the same or it doesn\'t matter whether your costs may or may not be naturally lower. Or are you saying that the untapped US DFS market whenever this happens will be enough that this mystery BTC site can acquire an untouched player pool that makes it competitive with DK/FD/etc.? But at that rate when does DOJ get involved? \n\nAnd I know you didn\'t mention smart contracts, but I think they\'re worth noting here because even if you use them anonymously you still run into the situation where you need a *lot* of fish to attract sharks for the rake economics to scale. Because as much as the smart contract casino might save by using smart contracts, if they\'re not creating a fun, secure, easy to use environment layer for fish (and developing and maintaining this does cost money at scale, extrinsic to your actual smart contract setup), then the fish won\'t come. And so while the sharks might be impressed by the low rake, they won\'t come if there\'s no player pool for them. It\'s the same reason that I know many US citizens who play/have played consistently on Bovada, but few if any that can say the same about SealsWithClubs (which has had impressively really cheap rake). Which isn\'t to say SwC doesn\'t have a soft field, but it\'s just not a liquid solution for somebody hoping to consistently make money. Of course SwC isn\'t a decentralized smart contract solution, but that doesn\'t seem relevant to the comparison unless the counterclaim is that a large reason SwC didn\'t become more popular was because it was centralized.': 1, 'Why do you think that they seem like ideal candidates?

It promises too many contradicting traits (decentralization, 4 seconds confirmation time with 120 seconds block time, small blockchain with much higher tps capacity, proper incentive structure, true anonymity where there isn\'t, 51%-safeness [but still decentralized!]). There must be a catch, or many. Dash mainstream superficial marketing is definitely hiding away something. Big P&D.\n\nAlso Dash\'s homepage (which has a grammatical error already in the introductory text) only lists some nice-sounding buzzwords without explaining what\'s behind. If Dash proponents then say: "read our papers", that\'s hippocratic. If there were true substance behind, then the buzzwords would be linked to better explanations directly. This is not the case.\n\nTo me Dash sounds like a giant scam with half-baked truths, to put it diplomatically.': 0, 'Monero is not a Bitcoin clone, though it improves privacy and fungibility. Not sure about transaction malleability. But of course Bitcoin has far better usability, liquidity, and adoption. ': 3, 'Dash hash solved many of the issues Bitcoin has and will continue to solves more with v.13 Evolution. \n\nThis was posted in https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=421615.msg12643076#msg12643076\n\n1) Bitcoin is too slow to use in person-to-person transactions.\n2) Bitcoin\'s fees are too high for it to be used for micropayments.\n3) Bitcoin doesn\'t scale past 7 TPS.\n4) Bitcoin\'s blockchain is huge and it\'s unlikely to be pruned due to consensus issues.\n5) Bitcoin has a very high level of infighting and it\'s nearly impossible to achieve consensus. As Tok pointed out earlier, the only consensus in the Bitcoin community is that it should be left alone and never changed, updated, improved, or fixed.\n6) Bitcoin nodes are disappearing at an alarming rate because they aren\'t incentivized.\n7) Bitcoin\'s consensus mechanism is under constant risk of attack. Collusion of just two pools would allow double-spends.\n8) Long-standing issues like transaction malleability still have not been cleared up, and there\'s no sign that Bitcoin developers have any interest in fixing them.\n9) Bitcoin\'s governance model is deeply flawed. Funding comes from centralized sources (Foundation and MIT) and governance is dangerously fragmented between often-hostile devs.\n10) Bitcoin is and always will be traceable. People don\'t want the world knowing the details of their finances, and as more people move into crypto this will become a bigger and bigger issue. "You mean everybody can see how much money I have and where I sent it if they know my address?"\n11) Bitcoin devs and maximists have their heads buried in the sand and refuse to accept that Bitcoin might not be the solution for everything. It\'s analogous to the situation in World War II when Japanese admirals were too scared or proud to report their actual losses, and so their high command kept making decisions based on incorrect information.\n12) Centralization and censorship in the community. Theymos has managed to grab ownership of BCT and the subreddit and regularly censors any voices he disagrees with (case-in-point: anyone who talked about Bitcoin-XT).\n13) Bitcoin is complicated to use and understand for a neophite. We all remember how long it took us to fully wrap our heads around everything.\n\nDash already solves many of these problems, and Dash Evolution will solve the rest of them:\n\n1) Dash has InstantX, which allows transactions to be fully confirmed in about four seconds.\n2) Dash Evolution apparently has no fees (information from the slide).\n3) Dash Evolution will scale to 1500+ TPS.\n4) Dash Evolution is likely to use pruning at some point (Evan has spoken about this before and says pruning is definitely possible).\n5) Dash enables masternode owners to vote and express their opinions in a binding fashion using the decentralized budgeting system.\n6) Dash nodes (masternodes) are incentivized and the number grows daily. The growth will eventually taper, but there is very little chance of numbers declining due to the significant incentivization.\n7) Dash Evolution will have a confirmation-less wallet using InstantX locks for all transactions. Even if one entity gets 51% or more of the network\'s hash power, it will be impossible to double-spend.\n8) Dash developers regularly incorporate fixes as the problems are discovered. A great example of this was the "dead change" issue that Aswan discovered last year. It was fixed very rapidly.\n9) Dash uses Decentralized Governance by Blockchain to enforce good governance and to pay developers directly from the blockchain. It\'s decentralized and trust-less.\n10) Dash users have the option of using Darksend to anonymize their transactions, and Dash Evolution will build this anonymity into the protocol itself, making all transactions anonymous by default.\n11) Dash regularly incorporates new ideas from the community and from other cryptos, or even from the trolls in our own community. Evan has actually said that many of his best ideas came from the arguments trolls were trying to use against us.\n12) This thread is unmoderated, and Dashtalk, while moderated, has no history of censorship.\n13) Dash Evolution will be using a decentralized API to make the network trivial to use for newbies (information comes from presentation slide...I don\'t know how this works yet, but I do know that Evan has previously said that making Dash easy to use was a priority).': 1, 'Litecoin and Monero.': -1, 'which fixes, please?': 3}, ('Showerthought: Bitcoin is the Real version of Second Life', 0): {'This makes no sense.': 5}}}
