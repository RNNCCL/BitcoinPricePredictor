Because Coinbase provides transactions off blockchain between individuals.  They can provide (if they don\'t already) mass settlement between exchanges (so you can move your bitcoin again, off blockchain and avoid fees).  They can set up an agreement with BitPay and do the same thing, avoid on blockchain transactions via a Coinbase wallet and Bitpay software.\n\nBasically, Bitcoin can be removed from many transaction scenarios as a distributed, autonomous, trustless payment system, to a centralized, managed, and government happy system.   And the motivator to leave all the true Bitcoin wallets behind?  Fees.\n\nBecause that is what running into the hard limit on transactions does, it raises fees.  Removes the small transactions (the "Entry Drug" of Bitcoin) from the market.  And Coinbase is in the position to capitalize on that.\n\nSo as you bash Brian, keep in mind that either he *really, really* is retarded and doesn\'t understand the short term opportunity to corner a huge portion of the market that the average Joe assumes to be the utility of Bitcoin...\n\n*Or he really is trying to promote some solution to a real and present danger to the Bitcoin protocol, as he sees it.*\n\nBeing in much the same position, and saying many of the same things (without actually endorsing Classic), I can relate.

But an assumption needs to be made about how long the transaction is going to be, at the time you open it.  If it is paid when it is closed, it's good you have RBF, because if your fee is too low, you'll want to be upping this as soon as you can, so you can retrieve any unspent value within a channel.\n\nAlso, there's going to need to be some clearing-house that connects channels.

If your breakeven between bitcoin fees and lightning is above $100 at 0.5%, then bitcoin fees are at least 50c per transaction. So the assumptions don\'t quite make sense.\n\nNobody really knows how much lightning fees will be; maybe they\'ll be zero (funded by big data analytics or something?), maybe they\'ll be flat, maybe they\'ll be a percentage. Nobody really knows whether lightning transactions will mostly be micro transactions (internet-of-things devices sending each other a few cents?) or if it\'ll be useful for buying more expensive things ($100 jeans? $500 rent payments? $1000 tv? $20000 car?) as well.\n\nThe "costs" of running a LN are miniscule: the marginal CPU/bandwidth costs for a single transaction are on the order of fractions of  a satoshi [1] so 100 tx/s is on the order of 3e9 transactions per year, which will cost less than 1e-8 bitcoin each in real resources used, for a total of less than 30 BTC/year or about $14k. Other costs are bitcoin fees for opening and closing channels, time cost of money (could you do something more useful with bitcoin than hosting lightning channels), and the risk that your lightning node might get hacked and your money stolen. I think each of them would be more substantial than the CPU/network costs; but until lightning actually exists, they\'re pretty hard to estimate.\n\n[0] http://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/lightning-dev/2015-September/000218.html\n[1] http://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/lightning-dev/2015-October/000266.html': 1, 'Is this satire?': 1, 'Sigh...': 1, 'It\'s hard to predict but my guess is that fees will be close to zero. Nodes need money and to get a channel opened towards you, you would have to pay interest but if fungibility is a concern then intermediary anonymous nodes might sponsor transactions to get their funds mixed. So anything, including negative fees is possible.\n\nEdit: Bitcoin\'s fungibility is my biggest concern, long before block size. /u/maaku7 [seams to think the same](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/46po4l/we_have_consensus_in_april_we_get_sw_3_months/d082hi8). Maybe he can comment here, too.\n\nSure, with bitcoin being fungible, nobody would pay a premium to get his bitcoins mixed but the discount at which you can get certain coins is a direct measure to how fungible bitcoin is and how desperately in need of fungibility we are, to avoid taxes being payable in white-listed coins only for example. Only if mixing is part of the fabric of bitcoin can we achieve fungibility. \n\nSo lets assume it\'s 2030 and with or without negative fees at some points we achieved fungibility. Nobody trades certain bitcoins at a discount anymore, which is what fungibility means. Will we still have a chance on low fees? I bet we do. Providing nodes will be as easy as `apt-get install lightningd` and sending it some initial funds for bootstrapping. Maybe you want to tweak the fees to gain traffic/help the network faster but most lightningd will be run by those who move money a lot anyway. Employers for example. Instead of paying me my weekly $100 paycheck in an on-chain transaction, they would put $300 into a channel that gets updated every hour in my favor by $300/24/7. Whenever I buy I coffee now, it would get shifted by $3 in their favor, with a request to credit some other node $3 which eventually would end up paying my coffee. I would pick a route that doesn\'t go me->employer->starbucks but maybe me->employer->google->piratebay->anon@40->starbucks, with each only knowing his direct neighbors, to hide my coffee addiction.\n\nNow my employer would nominally lend me $300 minus what\'s on my side of that channel and probably charge me interest on that but given the security of this "loan", interest rates are as low as they can get. With bitcoin being deflationary, this loan could be considered an investment that already pays interest, held by my employer.\n\nWould my employer charge me for cpu cycles for each coffee I buy? I\'d argue he wouldn\'t. anon@40 might have stopped paying me for using his tor hidden service but if he charged a significant fee I would find somebody else who doesn\'t, to include in my route for anonymity.\n\nNot sure where fees could come from if we figure out fungibility.': 3}, ("Now accepting bids on (the first job posted to) Bitcoin's first multisig-powered, ECDSA-authenticated, decentralized freelance market: Rein", 20): {'Getting started HOWTO: https://github.com/ReinProject/python-rein/blob/master/doc/HOWTO-setup-rein.md': 4}, ('Mark Friedenbach opposes the HF-consensus that was just reached today?', 70): {'seems like this kiddie-fight could go on for a while...': 3, 'they promised to write code and submit it. nothing more. how are they not able to deliver on that promise?': 9, "Yes, I think that's part of the problem.

For instance, if Core devs were split 50/50 between 2 MB blocks first or SegWit first, then half of the Core devs can create a fork and abandon Bitcoin Core. Both forks will consider themselves to be the best progression for Bitcoin but effectively there would be two coins, both having a value that is only a small fraction of the current value. It would take years to get over such a split, if it would be ever possible. I think most people will call it quits.\n\nOn the other hand, if the community disagrees with the Core devs, but the Core devs themselves agree on the way forward, then there is no danger of any fork and Bitcoin can just progress naturally along the roadmap outlined by the devs. And who is "the community" anyway? There will always be groups who have differing views on how to go forward.

[Here is roughly how credit cards work](http://www.creditcards.com/credit-card-news/how-a-credit-card-is-processed-1275.php).  The heavy lifting is still done via batch processing (like we did in the 60\'s, when Credit Cards came into their own).\n\n* VISA is a distributed collection of individual processing parties, each of which certainly still puts Bitcoin to shame on transaction volume and speed, but the difference is many orders of magnitude less than described here.\n\n* And no, they don\'t have a simple consensus model.  The link I provided VASTLY simplifies the actual flow.  There are things like the Merchant\'s bank, point of sale systems, and payment networks (that let you use your VISA in Hong Kong) that are all missing.\n\n* VISA doesn\'t have to worry about double spends, because you are taking on debt, not paying value.  So if you pay twice, you get charged twice, NP.   So all they need is to do a rough estimate and then they can take days (or even months) to figure out the real story.\n\n*  The goal of most of us calling for larger blocks is to avoid a hard limit causing clear and immediate damage to Bitcoin.  Nobody, not even one person I know, thinks that we can raise the blocksize and take on VISA toe to toe.  \n\n* Changing Bitcoin to a zero sum game (where you getting your transaction into a block means someone else did not) carries real risks, *which trotting out VISA utterly ignores*.\n\nWhat might a year of restricted Bitcoin Transactions do to Bitcoin?\n\n* Centralize Payment Processing.  Because off-chain transactions can be performed without Bitcoin fees, companies like BitPay, Coinbase, GoCoin, Circle, and others are well positioned to become centralized payment processors who collect the fees and transfer Bitcoin on the books instead of on the Blockchain.  I thought, in this space, we wanted to move away from Banks and trusted third parties.\n\n* Loss of the Bitcoin "Entry Drug", the small casual Internet transaction without a trusted third party described by Satoshi in the first paragraph of the Bitcoin whitepaper.  You know, the one entitled, [Bitcoin: \nA Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System ](http://nakamotoinstitute.org/bitcoin/#selection-7.4-9.39)?\n\n* Loss of Bitcoin value to other cryptocurrency options without such limitations (at least not in the next year or two) that can capitalize on high Bitcoin transaction fees (or the fear of such fees).\n\n* With loss of Bitcoin value, we could have loss of security.  Fewer full nodes, less mining power. More centralized mining power (as cheap power is no longer enough to mine; one may need power approaching free, at least until the mining power drops away).\n\n* The scaling plan just discussed from the RT in HK would pretty much require shedding 20 to 50 percent of projected Bitcoin transaction growth between now and July 2017.   Does anyone know exactly what fee level makes that many people turn away from Bitcoin?  I\'ve heard talk that we don\'t care about "ants", or that we don\'t need use cases that depend on small transactions.  Do we think that\'s 20 to 50 percent of transaction volume?\n\n* Lighting Networks will save us!  Beside the fact that you should *never depend* on code that will be here *very soon now*, Lighting Networks require Bitcoin Transactions, and high fees will hinder the deployment.  It is also unclear if Lighting Networks can work with business in the Western world due to regulations on transferring funds between parties.\n\nI could go on.  But the point is that this debate is not helped by crying VISA when people talk about the hard limit.\n\n**Edit:** Before anyone thinks I am picking on LN for their delivery schedule, I\'ve been the developer (and am the developer) who finds himself saying his code will be ready "very soon now".

It really is trading Bitcoin, it really is as secure as Bitcoin, at least potentially (vast network outages preventing you from closing channels being maybe the biggest additional risk).

Here is a link to their [summary.](https://lightning.network/lightning-network-summary.pdf) (It's a pdf.  Sorry if that is annoying).\n\nI do think we have to eventually get to something like LN.  But my objection is leaping for a solution when we haven't built, deployed, tested, and validated said solution.   Growing the blocksize to accommodate another year or two is within reason for our hardware and network, and gives us time to put a solution into place.  \n": 2, "> Thanks for the reply.

It will never be fast enough for that, and the balance between convenience and need for truth is not good in such use cases. Bitcoin is most useful where truth is most important and least useful where speed is most important.

The "throughput" of zero conf transactions is whatever rate the network nodes can relay them, and the capacity is however much mempool is available to store them.\n\nThroughput only makes sense in reference to confirmations, because confirmations are limited to a probabilistic interval that averages 1 block every 10 minutes.  \n\nDoubling the size of the block doubles the maximum number of transactions that could be confirmed in a given time period - scaling the capacity by a factor of 2.

There\'s a faction that is really representative to the fact that we need a scheduled hardfork, but now that we are seeing the formation of that proposal, we now have a faction thats decreeing that consensus is not derived from people sitting in one room.\n\nI actually beg to disagree on a basic psychological fundamentalism with social behaviors. Clearly there is a large faction that is going to follow core without any regard to the path forward, so long as it is not *extreme*. This would be the conservative faction that has an appeal to authority that will support anything that comes out of the satoshi github repository. I would state with consideration for bias that this faction has fundamental justification for this behavior, considering the history of core and its well respected members. Its a impressive list, and quite diverse with a lot of counter-opposing ideas within. This is *good*. I would like to see Gavin, Jeff continue to work within core because the balancing of ideas is important and its *really* important that there be contrasting views for the health of the ecosystem.\n\nMeaning that anything that core proposes, we will see a majority of the users support it by default, so long again, as its *not extreme*. This means that while full consensus is not built within a room, it has a strong influence to creating consensus industry wide through the microphone piece (satoshi github/core).\n\nThe analogy is akin to the white house. The president, while he does have veto and executive orders, he cannot change the outcome of congress (miners) except *by the means of using the whitehouse as a propaganda platform to build rapport with the citizens of the nation*. With these citizens being the constituents in a representative democracy, this is a 2nd layer approach to try to influence congress by proxy through the people. Now I understand that we can go into complexities like representatives not doing what the constituents want (miners ignoring users) but I think for the most part the users have the ultimate power as the final say (I will use this software or I will use a different software). Further, users have the power to vote out both congress and the president *at any time*, which is a improvement on the representative-democracy model in comparison here.\n\nCore is in a similar position where their platform allows them a advantage to build consensus by vocalizing their support, which comes in the form of software releases, core issued statements with signatures, or the ACK process on the devlist signaling strong support for issues.\n\nI would say that the establishment (core), is already a political party by default, even if they dont try to be. Even if you would disagree with this ideology, I think its ultimately clear that they are *at least* a central planning committee that is influenced the same as all humans are.\n\nAnd I think this recent "consensus" is a transparent example of this political process and how the final result is molded by it, regardless of what it may be.\n\nAnd I think those who wanted the HF need to be happy with the compromise, and that core should *really* hope that the blocksize limit is not hit, creating a artificial market that prices some users out or frustrates people into moving to another software system, be it bitcoin or a altcoin. This would also cause another HF war with alternative clients offering to "fix" the situation by raising the limit.\n\nWith all that said, I think gavin is merely expressing his frustration at the political process, by recognizing it for exactly what it is - a political process/central planning committee. And if they can decide these things, then they can decide these other things, right?\n\nI hope that lukejr builds a solid platform for the future HF proposals so that we have better consensus logic in the future, and less political process.

While it\'s technically precisely accurate to say "when it\'s safe", it\'s also ambiguous enough that you could keep changing the definition of what\'s "safe" so that it\'s never safe.\n\nTo put it another way: It\'s not a falsifiable to say "core will do a hard fork when it\'s safe" -- if you don\'t do a hard fork, you can always come up with a definition of "safe" that\'s not yet met. But even without working out in advance how to define "safe" exactly, it\'s easily falsifiable to say (eg) "core thinks it will be safe by $DATE1, and presuming that pans out will have code ready by $DATE2, aiming for activation on $DATE3."

(I don\'t understand why the word "effective" is popular.. the witness data is not separate from the block)\n\n> To be clear, this hard fork would raise the limit imposed on block space, defined as the space in which non-segwit transactions are stored in their entirety. Right?\n\nCorrect, although that is a strange definition for "block space".': 3, 'Not really. The SW SF is pretty elegant already. The reason the HF is based on it, is because SW is the cleanest way to fix some serious problems of just increasing the block size. Pre-SW, a 2 MB block could literally have taken several *hours* to verify (exponentially increasing with size). SegWit makes these steps instead a linear increase in complexity/verification time.': 4, '>I don\'t understand why the word "effective" is popular.. the witness data is not separate from the block\n\nMaybe I\'m missing something big here then. I\'d be interested in your take on this:\n\nFrom what I understand, the SegWit proposal would enable a transaction style in which the signature data are stored externally to the block in which the transaction appears.\n\nGains in block space under this system require the use of SegWit-style transactions. If nobody uses them, then block space does not expand under SegWit. And so the use of the term "effective."': 3, "The goal for SW included in core?
