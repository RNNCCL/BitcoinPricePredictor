My emphasis on "public" is because that removes the possibility of a compromised environment, and truly makes the proof irrefutable as far as proving key validity is concerned.  The private demonstration described by Gavin is not irrefutable proof of key ownership; Gavin mentioned one potential attack vector and there are others.  \n\nMaybe this is just me, but imo "irrefutable" evidence is not that which you admit was possible to be forged.  The definition of the word is that it\'s *impossible* to deny or disprove.

OF COURSE he should just publish a signed message or (equivalently) move some btc through the key associated with an early block.\n\nGavin knows he wasn\'t presented irrefutable evidence; he does think he was presented fairly difficult to fake evidence that combined with his other subjective judgements convinced him "beyond a reasonable doubt" that Craig was Satoshi.
