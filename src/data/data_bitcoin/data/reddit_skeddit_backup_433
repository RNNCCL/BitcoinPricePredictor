It's like a way of having credit with someone without having to give them all the bitcoin at once.\n\nNext, it's great for bitcoin price because hypothetically a future of lightning network connections means that people have to close channels out when they've finished transmitting the value (or want to close the channel).

H(N-1) = H(H(N)), H(1000000) =\n<random secret seed>).\n\nTo recap:\n\n\tThe Commitment Tx has an output to Alice-tmpkey and Bob, and Bob\ngives Alice a signed 40-day timelocked Commitment Refund Tx. To\ninvalidate the commitment tx, Alice gives Bob Alice-tmpkey.\n\nSo the Commitment Tx output and Commitment Refund Tx serve three\npurposes:\n\n1) If the commitment tx goes to blockchain, Alice can her money is N\n   days (normal channel close).\n2) If the commitment tx is invalidated, then goes to the blockchain,\n   Bob (with Alice's tmpkey) can write a replacement commitment and\n   steal the money.\n3) If (1) Bob can help Alice get the money sooner if he wants to.\n\nSo we can't just replace Alice-tmpkey with Alice-preimage, since Alice\nneeds to reveal this to spend, and that would mean a race.  But we can\nchange the commitment tx output to allow immediate spend if Bob has the\npre-image, as follows:\n\n\tAlice's sig and relative-checklocktimeverify N days\n\tOR Bob's sig and hash preimage\n\nNote that I snuck in RCLTV; it simplifies things.  This means that you\ncan invalidate the Commitment TX by giving Bob the hash preimage.

That right there is actually a Bitcoin script, aka smart contract (because it\'s self enforcing).\n\nThe reason we normally have to wait for confirmations in the blockchain is to prevent Alice paying Bob, then immediately "double-spending" that payment back to herself and hoping the network will confirm the refund first (and reject the original payment).\n\nThis is where multisignature transactions come in. Say we have a multisig address that requires both you and I to sign for the payment to be valid, imagine there is 10 BTC in there. We talk between each other and I agree to sign a payment for 10 BTC to you. If I give you that transaction, in order for you to spend it, you must also sign it.

It experiences boom/bust cycles.  There\'s a similarity there with bitcoin.\n\n> Correct me if I am wrong, but that will require tiny amounts of bitcoin only. It will not hold up the floor.\n\nAbsolutely it holds up a floor.  Where that floor is, I\'m not sure.  But Nasdaq definitely has an "industrial" use for bitcoin.\n\n> If a miner was spending 100\'000 $/month of electricity to mine 120\'000 $/month worth of bitcoin\n\nYou\'re speculating numbers; not all miners have the same cost of electricity.  Electricity is MUCH cheaper in some parts of the world than others.  So yes, a large drop will necessitate that *some* miners leave the playing field, but that doesn\'t necessarily indicate that they ALL will.  And many will mine through a temporary drop with the expectation of quick rebounds.  The point is that miners will not simultaneously shut off their mining rigs in lock step.\n\n> That is true, the drop in hashpower can be somewhat less than 90%, but can also be more than 90%.\n\nAgain, miners who mine professionally will not necessarily shut off immediately following a crash in price.  The hashrate will adjust, but not immediately and not simultaneously.\n\n> Right. It would be stupid to worry about the plane not having enough fuel before the fuel actually runs out. \n\nFalse analogy.  Your "fuel" is constantly replenishing and dropping out worldwide on a regular basis.  Hashing power is not derived from a single source.  People have LOTS of different incentives and plans for their mining rigs and are not coordinated.  \n\nAdditionally, a 90% drop is something that\'ll most likely rebound as people see opportunity to grab cheap coins.  Whether it\'s a dead cat bounce or not is irrelevant, because as long as the descent is slower than *immediate*, the difficulty levels will have a chance to adjust.\n\nThe truth is, we\'ve seen when mining rewards dropped by *half* at the first reward halving and mining didn\'t slow down to the degree you\'re surmising.

": 2, '> What is the cause of this crazy delusion?\n\nRoughly: as the price increases, more people will hoard it, reducing the available supply and thus pushing the price further up.  As the free supply tends to zero, the price will tend to "infinity" (or some absurdly high value, say 1 M $/BTC).  \n\nThe price cannot ever stabilize, because if it stops increasing it will no longer be a good investment.  Then hoarders will try to sell all their holdings, no one will want to buy, and the price will crash.  When that happens, the miners will lose the revenue from block rewars, and will have to increase the fees. that will reduce the trasnction volume, that will further reduce the mienrs revenue.\n\nAlso: now, in 2015, each day investors put ~ 1 M $ into the system, to buy the coins generated by the miners.  In order to prevent the network from shrinking, they must keep pouring in at least that amount, no matter what the block reward is.  Eventually, those 2015 investors will want to get their investment back with profit.  To simplify the argument, let\'s say that they all decide to cash out in 2016,  To get a 50% profit, they must sell their coins. that they bought in 2015, for 1.5 M $.  The only place where that money can come is from the people who will be investing in 2016.  Thus, every day the  2016 investors must provide 2.5 M $: being 1 M $ or more for the miners, and 1.5 for the 2015 investors.  One year later, when the 2016 investors try to recover those 2.5 M $ with 50% profit, the 2017 investors will have to provide 4.75 M $ per day: 1 M $ for the miners plus 3.75 M $ for the 2016 investors.

The hashrate grows both because new mines are coming into play; and also because the technology is improving, so the same revenue (dollars;day) suports more hashes/second. \n\nWhen the price fell from 1200 in november to 900 in January (25% loss) miners were still probably making more than 50% profit over the electricity costs.  So they probably continued to mine, except perhaps for some older mines or miners in places with expensive energy.  Many mines were under construction and continued to come on line during 2014, with better technology; so, even though the total revenue of all miners was dropping, the hashrate continued to increase.\n\nBut mining equipment manufaturers already have stopped innovating because the sales have dwindled.  Many miners have shut down, and only the residual improvement in efficiency (hashes per joule) has kept the hashrate rom dropping.  It is unclear how profitable mining is now, and it obviously depends on the location.  I have seen claims that it will remain profitable as long as the price is above 100--150 $/BTC, while others claim that they are already close to break-even.

Then think of embarrassing purchases, purchases from unbanked countries, purchases where anonymity is an issue (VPNs), and illegal purchases. Now we are talking serious utility relative to the other options.\n\nTo anyone who still entertains this notion that Bitcoin is a currency *right now*, let me explain something: Currency requires currentness. Currentness means that it is generally accepted. If Bitcoin were generally accepted, the price would be at least $100,000 per coin already. \n\nSo how does Bitcoin proceed? Certainly not from brick and mortar adoption, nor even from Amazon adopting it. It starts with the applications where it can provide the *highest* marginal benefit: black markets, evading capital controls, hiding/"offshoring" wealth, other "store of value" applications, etc. Then as these have driven the price higher the infrastructure follows and then in myriad incremental (and sometimes sudden) ways new applications become feasible and are invented. VPNs, porn, remittances, and a mix of the familiar and radically new prospects that everyone here is familiar with. All this happens in a virtuous cycle with price, mining, venture capital investment, infrastructure rollout, increased trust, better image, better user-friendliness, the overcoming of security obstacles, more interest from coders and financial people, etc. \n\nEventually merchants start start finding that Bitcoin spending during bubbles is a fair size of their payment pie, and then the cost savings raise eyebrows, they offer incentives for payment in BTC, and things really start snowballing for merchant adoption. Finally, *at the very end*, brick-and-mortar stores accept it simply because a sizable number of people already use it daily for online purchases. \n\nMost importantly, all through this process investors are buying BTC not to enable purchases but to capitalize on the coming stages of adoption.

But spending these (untainted) bitcoins to pay a vendor, for example, give the vendor those coins for spending on either side as they remain untainted.

More people mining does not result in [significantly] more Bitcoins being created (thanks to the rise in the difficulty adjustment as more mining occurs).\n\nI sure wish they would use a realistic approach to calculation.\n\nToday we have 342,478 Th/s.     If all mining were done using a 1.15 Th/s Antminer S5 then you would need nearly 300,000 of the units.  Each unit draws 590 Watts, so that is 4,248,000 kWh per day that today all hashing combined consumes (again, assuming all is using the Antminer S5).  That S5 is a miner that is very efficient on power (Mh/Joule) so let\'s double that to get a number more realistic that accounts for many of the more inefficient miners still out there.   So that is ~8,500,000 kWh per day.\n\nAt the $0.05 per kWh quoted in the Coindesk article, that\'s nearly a half million dollars per day of electricity on mining.   Since the average residential power is much higher (in the U.S. it is $0.12 per kWh, source: http://shrinkthatfootprint.com/average-electricity-prices-kwh ), more is probably spent on mining per day.    Probably not much more than the ~$850,000 that the 3,600 coins mined each day are worth though.\n\nIncidentally, that 8,500,000 kWh per day is about the same amount used by roughly 700,000 persons in the U.S. (source: http://shrinkthatfootprint.com/average-household-electricity-consumption ).\n\n8,500,000 kilawatt hours (kWh) == 8,500 megawatt hours (mWh) ==  8.5 gigawatt hours (gWh) == 0.0085 terawatt hours (tWh).  That\'s per-day.  Per-year it is 3.1025 tWh.\n\nI have no idea what calculation they have that makes the jump from today\'s 3.1 tWh per year (as I calculate it) to the 22,688 tWh per year that their "calculator" yields (using as input, today\'s $235 exchange rate, 3,600 mined per-day, 100% going to electricity, and $0.05 per kWh.)': 1, 'Will still spend as much on mining overall though - depends solely on price.

Imagine you have $10M in BTC and can afford paying $100 per transaction. It's still cheaper and safer than holding that much in gold, real estate or stocks. But there are 10x more people who can afford paying $11 per transaction, not more. If the block limit is increased, then 1) you can pay $11 instead of $100 2) liquidity of your coins increased 10x (because more people can receive it from you directly) 3) miners will earn more.\n\nSo whenever fees are driven up by competition for a space in block, everyone who can transact will be interested in increasing that space.
