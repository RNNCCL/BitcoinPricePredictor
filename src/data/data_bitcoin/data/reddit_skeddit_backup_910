It\'s something that can be replicated anywhere a couple CPUs can be networked.  Like the internet, no one "runs" the network or is in charge of it, and no one owns the code that runs it.  The original author who imagined the Bitcoin concept has preferred to remain anonymous.\n\n\nThe tokens of exchange are secure, more so than any bank can provide, and therefore can represent a value, which can be anything.\n\n\nThe first and most obvious implementation of this technology was to make a digital "coin" which could be used to represent anything that we\'d normally put value on.  As far as its implementation as a currency goes, it can be thought of like a Paypal for the internet\xe2\x80\x94only without the Paypal.\n\n\nSo far, what\xe2\x80\x99s attracted the most attention to the protocol, has been its ability to serve as a digital currency, for which its well suited.  Its characteristics lend itself to work like digital cash.  But just like real cash, it is easily lost or stolen.  Much stronger security measures are in development, which the community hopes will one day make it secure for anyone to use\xe2\x80\x94even my grandma.\n\n\nHowever, for all its use as a currency, this is to me its least interesting aspect.\n\n\nAt it\'s core, the language allows disparate parties, who\'ve never even met, to create a consensus on a given issue.  Something Congress knows a little about how hard that can be.  And it has been, until this protocol was imagined, equally difficult to do so between different parties over a network.\n\n\nUntil the Bitcoin technology came about in 2008, the only way to do this was to trust an (hopefully fair and neutral) arbitrator.  Bitcoin allows direct consensus without this intermediary.  This break-through still surprises me today, as I was fairly certain this wouldn\'t be possible.\n\n\nBut it turns out, it is possible!  And Bitcoin isn\xe2\x80\x99t a gimmick or a get-rich-quick scheme.  It represents a significant step forward in computer science.  And like discovering a new physics theorem, we cannot un-learn it.  It\'s something that will influence the way code is written, how things are published, and how things are exchanged from now on.  It will impact numerous industries.\n\n\nMy own interest lies in medical research, and the implications the protocol has to me are fascinating.\n\n\nHaving said all that, it\'s still a fledgling baby technology, just five years old.  There are a ton of technical issues to work out.  But as insights into the protocol arise, it\xe2\x80\x99s also giving us ways to solve those issues that have never come to light before:  like up-to-the-second provable solvency of an insurance or exchange business, as an example.\n\n\nThe technology at the heart of Bitcoin will improve research, accommodate greater transparency (for non-profits for example), provide for mediums of exchange, provide proof of publishing, and shift how decisions over things are arrived at.

Simply use something like Truecrypt and sync an encrypted drive.  No way anyone can see or access the files.\n\nFurthermore, doing a peer to peer clustered cloud system would be incredibly slow and inefficient for any reasonably sized file.\n\nThe only real advantage this system has is lending everyone\'s unused storage space to a cloud which could give users a lot of space for very cheap.  But the thing is, cheap storage is not a problem at all.  Hard drives are becoming cheaper and cheaper and it would always make sense for the performance to simply buy your own cloud storage (you\'d get comparable storage at a much higher performance).\n\nEnvironmentally and economically it would cost more to run all this individual computers too than having one efficient storage data center as well.

Make you already suspicious as well as make you bandwidth useless. It's just stupid to use for at this point. A simple VPN service would be more then enough and still useless.\n\n2) encrypting your data is totally useless since it is already split encrypted. \n\n\nI wouldn't waste too much time on thinking about these things since you don't have to do anything.": 4, ">So why wouldn't they prefer a much cheaper cloud?\n\nBecause I don't think it's going to be cheaper or by enough to justify the downsides.  We can already get terabytes of cloud for dollars a month.  You can self host cloud storage for a cents a month (after only paying a few hundred for the hardware).\n\nIf you're paying people to utilize their computers, that's going to cost them power and that power is overall going to be far more than the cost of operating a storage data center.  Eventually it's going to reach an ideal dollar point where less and less people are going to be running nodes because they can't justify the costs.  The only people who will be able to justify the costs are people who are running efficient systems so it slowly devolves back in to the data center model and at that point Storj just becomes an unnecessary middle man.\n\n>You will end up paying a little more for better bandwidth, but this cuts back on things like slow download speeds, so you don't have to worry about transferring a large file around. \n\nI really doubt this.  If your system is utilized by a lot of people you're not going to be able to get enough output hosted on enough system to transfer large files at max speeds.  If it could it would be incredibly inefficient (too many users storing files that will never be requested, users being capped by low upload speeds when they could be serving much faster, etc).\n\nEven if you could, most people can already max out their download speeds with existing cloud storage.  The extra time Storj takes to peer find would just be an inconvenience to most people.\n\n>The blockchain acts as a store for the metadata as opposed to us having some central server storing all of the data or the metadata so the network does not need to rely on any centralized sources.\n\nSo this is convoluted in my opinion.  Bitcoin is slow it's not for this type of thing.  Why not simply use a node and peering system like TOR or torrents use to populate this meta data?  It would be much faster and doesn't need to piggy back on a whole system not designed for that function.  It could still be decentralized, work better, and would NOT be susceptible to going down due to a Bitcoin related problem (large fork, double spend attack, etc).\n\nFurthermore, why does this even need to be decentralized?  If you can encrypt your data on any cloud storage system, no one has any reason to take it down.  Further decentralizing it doesn't make it any more safe.\n\n>While that is one of its uses, Storj is also a platform for the creation of decentralized applications on top of the network.\n\nWell you should really push this more.  You make it seem like you're not even focusing on the public side of access here.\n\nHowever, I will say that is essentially what Freenet is and what a lot of other decentralized hosting networks are.  They all have the problems I listed above (they are incredibly slow and inefficient and ultimately expensive in a grand scheme compared to centralized hosting).  They do have the advantage of being able to host content that can't be taken down though.  That is really your only selling point here.\n\nIf you can improve on it, great!

Here\xe2\x80\x99s the relevant section:\n\nProof-to-miner\n\nIn a proof-to-miner scheme, the payment to create trust for an identity is paid to the miner that first confirms the bitcoin transaction which is the proof. This scheme initially seems desirable, as there is no single entity which can be compromised, and it incentivizes the network to mine more, thereby making bitcoin more secure and, in turn, OpenBazaar more secure.\n\nTechnically, proof-to-miner can be achieved by including an OP_TRUE in the output script of the transaction. While anyone is, in principle, able to spend the output of the given transaction, a miner is incentivized to only include their own spending in their confirmation. Alternatively, a 0-output bitcoin transaction can be made, so that all the inputs are given to the next miner as fees. Again it is important to include the GUID of the OpenBazaar identity in the transaction.\n\nUnfortunately, it is again possible to game this system. This attack would work as follows: The malicious agent first generates a new OpenBazaar identity. Subsequently, they make a proof-to-miner bitcoin transaction with any amount they desire, but they keep the transaction secret. They then perform regular bitcoin mining as usual, but include their secret proof-to-miner transaction in their block confirmation. Including an additional transaction does not increase the cost of mining; therefore this approach can be employed by existing rational miners. If they succeed in generating a block, they publish the secret transaction and they gain identity trust in the OpenBazaar network, and can use the money again in the same scheme to increase their trust arbitrarily. If they do not succeed in generating a block, they keep the transaction secret and double-spend the money in a future transaction in the same scheme, until they are able to generate a block.': 1, "I've heard this idea mentioned before: rather than sending bitcoins to a true burn address, why not send them to e.g. a known charity address (proof-of-donation)?

When a seller makes his account he will select a % of each sale that will automatically go into a timelocked address, one new address per sale, so that each address will release its funds after specified period of time and the wallet will accrue over time and slowly pay back out. The wallet itself will be tied to his reputation, so that if his reputation drops below a certain threshold the wallet is destroyed. This will in effect continually serve to keep a seller honest, provided that the % held as a bond against him is more than the total sum held in escrow at any one time (exit-scam).**\n\nThis is probably more complex than your team is willing to do but proof-of-burn, which is really purchasable reputation points, doesnt really solve the problem of preventing the sort of scamming that is common among the anonymous markets.

Sacrifices (party A consumes resources, never gets anything back)\n2. Deposits (party A transfers resources to party B, gets them back at the end, but party B can steal in the interim)\n3. Hostages (party A transfers resources to party B in such a way that party B can either eventually give control back to A, or destroy the resources without benefiting)\n\nThe nice thing with PoB, as you mention, is that unlike many protocols that use sacrifices and hostages in the real world, here the destruction of BTC does not translate into a destruction of economic value; the value simply gets redistributed proportionately among everyone else. Hence, the protocols are actually _efficient_ (ie. not wasteful). The only way the protocol could conceivably be made even more efficient if the resources were instead transferred to some mechanism that provides a public good (eg. charity).\n\nSo my recommendation would be for some kind of system where users would maintain a list of approved charities, and if a given user had a certain charity in common with very many other users, then the sacrifice funds would go to the charity instead.

I believe the one positive argument out of the affirmative team was that it was possible for other currencies to exist to serve some niche.  For example, if the Bitcoin blockchain becomes too expensive for some kinds of transactions, it might be beneficial to have a "cheaper" one, that maybe does not provide the same level of security, but can exist for smaller cases.\n\nNamecoin might be the only example I can think of that serves this purpose.

The key is to figure out why the similarities matter, and why the differences don\'t matter.\n\nYour "hoarding" argument was fantastic and I think you could have pushed it further.  Imagine all stores and restaurants only took gift cards as payment.  You could only buy giftcards from shareholders of the company, who were given a fixed amount relative to their investment.  That\'s pretty much an appcoin.  The harder it is to hunt down a shareholder to get a gift card, the more valuable they are, even if the gift cards were denominated in "1 hamburger", instead of dollars.  People would hoard these just because it\'s a pain to acquire them and you might want to eat.  But change it up by having a machine that allows you to exchange any card at a market rate for cash of every shop with virtually no fee (say a fraction of a penny).  You have no incentive to hoard the cards anymore, you simply buy one outside the store, go in and use it, then walk out.\n\nAlso, if you would have known he was going the gift card route, you could have spoken of the unpopularity of gift cards as gifts (from receiving them).  People give them as gifts to avoid being tacky, not because they provide some kind of value.  The going rate for gift cards is substantially below market, and Johnston even admitted (or at least almost admitted it) as much.  People simply do not buy gift cards for themselves unless sold at a discount.\n\nThe frequent filer mile comparison is great, and I think one of you caught him on that, asking if he had ever purchased them.  Of course not!  There is one time to purchase them, and that\'s when they are about to expire and you need enough to redeem them.  No one in their right mind would.  I think you could have attacked that stronger with the gift card by asking if he ever bought gift cards for himself, and it only comes down to "well, this restaurant was offering you $10 in free gift cards if you bought $100, so I bought some.".  Or "If I buy an HEB Gift Card, I can use it to buy gas at an 11 cent discount per gallon".  It pretty much proves they are less valuable.\n\nAnother point I wish you would have hit them with harder is how there is no benefit of a network effect from having a service that accepts a special token.  They mention the whole "well, people love to evangelize their terrible investment" argument as why services that use Bitcoin aren\'t at the level of app-coin token services.  The trivality of forking any Open-Source project that has its own token, and switching that for Bitcoin will destroy any successful service.  Or even another  app-coin that doesn\'t need as much investment for infrastructure - the profit from investors will simply disappear as copy-cats exist, and there\'s no reason to use Storj vs. Storj2.0 if one is cheaper than the other.\n\nThey did have one good point - the appcoin model is a great business model for raising money.  Which is why they are following that path - it\'s a great way to get a lot of sucker investors who otherwise wouldn\'t be allowed to invest in something they can promote, give themselves discounts on the "IPO", then turn it over.  It\'s Wolf of Wall Street over and over.  They get in first, they dump it off to suckers, then can move onto the next coin while all these projects are in development, and come out ahead without having to do anything other than fleece the sheep.': 8, 'I believe the reasoning behind it is that appcoins are pegged to a company or application. \n\nWhere bitcoins can buy anything, the app coins can only be redeemed for products pegged to the company.  Its like having a coupon. Sure it knocks off 0.50 cents of the price, but that coupon can only be used on cat food.  So its great if you need catfood, but you are going to need cat food if you want to redeem value from the app coin. Really, they should just be called coupon coins. \n\n': 2, "Hi there,  \n  \nSo, there are some flaws in your argument. Primarily when you said this:\n>IPOcoins are scams in a nutshell  \n   \nAnyways, many appcoins go beyond what is currently possible with Bitcoin. Storj, for example, uses the blockchain to store metadata which the Bitcoin blockchain cannot do. *It is literally impossible for Storj to work on the Bitcoin blockchain.* It's not like we (Storj) wanted to create our own coin, it's because we *had* to. At that, we plan on integrating back into Bitcoin if sidechains and/or treechains come to fruition.  \n  \nAnother problem with your argument is that you imply that people shouldn't be getting money for their work. Some of our team members work full time on Storj, as well as having many part time volunteers and freelancers helping out. We have also have marketing costs, costs of travelling across the country, and so on that have to be paid for. Without some sort of money source, it would be impossible for Storj to even think about turning into a complete project. People can't spend everyday working on something without and expect to make a living. All of those other costs aren't free either, and we will have many costs to come during development and progression.  \n  \nAlso, nobody is forcing others to buy our coin (SJCX) and other project coins too.

Same argument anti-bitcoin people make. And it falls flat in the same way. All forms of money retain their value because those who buy and hold them believe in them as money. So, if appcoins are bubbled up as you say, so is bitcoin. In both cases folks are holding them because of their value in performing a technical task.\n\nWhile you and Pierre successfully refuted the gift card/miles analogy you did nothing to disprove the initial statement. Truth is that appcoins will likely provide functions (proposed storjcoin case in point) that bitcoin can\'t do and never will do. \n\nIn any case, the "bitcoin is the only blockchain" mindset is a bit strange if you ask me.

The profit of a DAC/Dapp could come from for example a cut of each transaction -- like BitShares X did, and rewarded back to the token holder. So as network gets more popular, the network gets more profitable for its "shareholders". Therefore the incentive to hold them is for value appreciation.
