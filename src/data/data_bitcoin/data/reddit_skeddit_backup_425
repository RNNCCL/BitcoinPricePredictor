(For instance, the breakdown of your holdings into UTxOs affects the minimum fee that you must pay to spend it.)\n\nHowever, replacing that model, or even getting rid of change-backs, would require more than a hard fork: it would require a complete redesign -- which would mean a new cryptocoin with a new network.': 1, '>It adds unnecessary transactions and size to blocks.\n\nExcept it doesn\'t. That change has to go somewhere.

The timestamps need not be issued or executed in order; but will usually be.\n\nEach entry L of the distributed ledger contains basically one confirmed transaction L.tx, augmented wth two timestamps L.inlastwid,L.outlastwid, two balances L.inbal,L.oubal, and two links L.inprev,L.outprev.  The field L.inprev links to the most recent previous ledger entry X where L.tx.inaddr appears as X.tx.inaddr or X.tx.outaddr.  Same for L.outprev.  The fields L.outbal and L.inbal are the current balances of L.tx.inaddr and L.tx.outaddr, including the effect of executing L.tx.\n\nBy following the inprev and outprev links from a ledger entry L, one could recover the full history H(L.tx.inaddr,L) of all executed transactions that have affected (withdrawn from or deposited to) L.tx.inaddr, up to and including L.  Similarly one could get H(L.tx.outaddr,L), the list of all executed transactions that have affected L.tx.outaddr, up to and including L.\n\nThe field L.inlastwid is the max timestamp among all executed transactions up to L that have **withdrawn** funds from L.tx.inaddr; namely, the largest X.tx.timestamp among all entries X in H(L.tx.inaddr,L) that have X.tx.inaddr = L.tx.inaddr.  \n\n*Almost* analogously, the field L.outlastwid is the largest timestamp among all executed transactions that have **withdrawn** (not deposited!) money from L.tx.outaddr; that is, the maximum X.timestamp among all entries X in H(L.tx.outaddr,L) with X.tx.**inaddr** = L.tx.outaddr.\n\nLet LAST(addr) denote the most recently processed entry L in the ledger where address addr is mentioned, i.e. with addr = L.tx.inaddr or addr = L.tx.outaddr.\n\nTo validate a transaction request txrq, the system checks its signature and then gets L = LAST(txrq.inaddr).  Let's suppose that txrq.inaddr = L.tx.inaddr, i.e. the last action on txrq.inaddr was another withdrawal.  (the other case, txrq.inaddr = L.tx.outaddr).\n\nIf txrq.timestamp > L.inlastwid, and L.inbal is not less than txrq.amount plus any fees, the transaction txrq cannot be a duplicate of an already executed transaction, and it is considered valid.  \n\nIf txrq.timestamp <= L.tx.inlastwid, then txrq may be a double-issue, or just an unprocessed transaction that happened to be delayed and processed out of order.  Only in this case the log H(txrq.inaddr,L) has to be searched backwards until an entry X with X.tx.inaddr = txrq.inaddr and X.inlastwid < txrq.timestamp, or X.tx.outaddr = txrq.inaddr and X.outlastwid < txrq.timestamp. If an identical transaction is found, txrq is rejected, otherwise it is considerd valid.\n\nOnce txrq is validated, the system fetches M = LAST(txrq.outaddr), and appends a new entry N  to the ledger, with N.tx = txrq, and updated values of N.inbal,N.outbal,N.inlastwid,N.outlastwid,N.inprev,N.outprev, computed from L, txrq, and M.\n\nHow to get this to work in a distributed-consensus tamper-proof atomic untrusted network is left as an exercise to the reader. ;-)\n\nAs an outsider, would expect that the cost (to me and to the system) of processing my t transactions that involve m distinct sender and receiver addresses, out of a total of n addresses in the world, should be something like O(t + m log n).  That would be the expected cost of a centralized solution. Can we get that with a distributed system?": 1, 'Not just that, preventing replay and allowing conflict control (e.g. when you want to double spend one particular in flight transaction but not others, or control the mutual exclusion map) requires nonce tracking, which ends up making the behavior almost equivalent to the UTXO coin tracking behavior in any case.\n\nE.g. consider Alice plays Bob and then Charlie. Then Alice wants to update the unconfirmed payment to Bob, perhaps to add fee or adjust amounts, but leave the transaction to Charlie unaffected.  In no case should any of Alices\' payments be replayable even if Alice has coins remaining.  You can get this with an "accounts" system, so long as you carefully always spend an account completely and never reuse one.  Of course, when you create a transaction you can\'t be sure that you won\'t want to conflict it later; so to be safe you\'d want to always transact in a way that permits selective conflicting-- thus Bitcoin\'s behavior.\n\n_Moreover_, some amount of privacy is an absolutely essential characteristic for any payment system-- it\'s basically unheard of in the modern world to have completely public account, and excessive disclosure can carry costly security consequences.  Bitcoin\'s answer to that is single use pseudonymous addresses;  so even if you really were sure you wouldn\'t want to selectively conflict later, getting even a modicum of privacy  that also pushes you into not reusing accounts; so Bitcoin just makes them inherently single use.': 3, '> E.g. consider Alice plays Bob and then Charlie. Then Alice wants to update the unconfirmed payment to Bob, perhaps to add fee or adjust amounts, but leave the transaction to Charlie unaffected. In no case should any of Alices\' payments be replayable even if Alice has coins remaining.\n\nI don\'t understand what is the intent here. Could you translate this example in terms of bank accounts and wire transfers?\n\nSay, Alice has 100$ in her account and issues a wire transfer order of 50$ to Bob and then 30$ to Charlie.  I suppose then she wants to cancel the order to Bob, which has not been executed yet, and replace it by an order of 55$ or 45$, without changing the payment to Charlie.  What does it mean "In no case should any of Alice\'s payments be replayable even if Alice has coins remaining"?\n\n> Moreover, some amount of privacy is an absolutely essential characteristic for any payment system\n\nYou could still emulate the UTXO system with a balance system by creating new addresses for each UTXO.  But a balance system also allows payments  to be processed in almost any order, and does not need change-backs.  In normal use, it also keeps all the data that is needed to validate a simple transaction in one single record (the current balance of the input address). \n\nIf you care, I discussed this topic a while ago with Peter Todd and some other redditor; I will try to find it tomorrow.': 0, "That's not an ": 1, "Ahh, that's it.

I just proposed the general design.": -2, "The scenario being discussed is hardly optimal, but Hearn is correct in contending that it is feasible to pursue a fork even with less than 50% of hashing power. Both branches after a hard fork can continue to exist for some time regardless of the percentage of total hashing power each has from before the fork.  \n\nIt's true that the fork that has less hashing power could be vulnerable to attack from miners on the other fork, but those miners would need to coordinate an attack together and all agree to forgo rewards in the coin that they profess to be supporting. Any rewards they earn while attacking *would be in the other bitcoin*. They would not be able to spend any such rewards earned during an attack in their own fork's economy.  \n\nSo there seem to be two possibilities: 1) a fork occurs, and for whatever reason the stronger chain (in terms of hashing power) does not 51% attack the weaker chain, or 2) a fork occurs and the stronger chain does successfully organize a sustained 51% attack on the weaker chain.  \n\nIn event the event of 1), both chains will continue as if they are independent SHA256 altcoins. One will eventually start being recognized as more useful or having more value, and therefore support a higher price per unit. If this happens to be chain that also has less hashing power, it will inevitably attract miners from the other fork because profits will be greater when mining the coin that has higher unit value *and* lower difficulty.  \n\nIn case of 2) the weaker chain that is getting attacked would need to take measures to continue to function. Another hard fork would likely be required to deploy measures to defeat any continued 51% attack from the stronger fork. In the worst case, the weaker coin could fork to a new hashing algorithm. At that point the stronger fork would have no more ability to attack the other fork, and for the entire duration of the attack they will have given up any chance of getting mining rewards in their own bitcoin. They'd now be stuck with a bunch of *the other bitcoin*, which they would not be able to spend without supporting the competing coin's economy. Even if they never spend or actively destroy the rewards mined during their attack, they'd just make the competing coin more scarce and hence more valuable per unit. Essentially, they will have paid to attack out of their own pockets, given up potential rewards, and only have succeeded in disrupting the other fork temporarily.": 1, 'Did someone just get shadow banned or was an account deleted?': 2}, ('[Moron Q] If we have a hard fork and, worst case, two incompatible chains, can users hedge by transacting on both forks?', 3): {'> the 1 MB fork would rapidly lose value in comparison\n\nBut this means that at some time the 1 MB fork would have *some* value.  And the 20MB would have less than full value.  This feels like a quite unstable and undesirable scenario, even if it is short-lived.  But: I really think you don\'t have to care, *at all*.  As long as you own all instances of a bitcoin across all the forks - their value *must* sum to 1, if you believe only one fork will survive.  You cannot believe chain A will fail without simultaneously believing that chain B will succeed.  You (i.e. the market) cannot hold any views about the probability of success of A without holding exactly the opposite view for B.  Even if views change rapidly, this is constant:  the sum of probabilities must equal 1, exactly - there is no "approximation" involved.  Consider this from the perspective of the total value of bitcoins A and B.  The sum must be exactly equal to the value of whichever emerges (leaving aside the noise and other factors which would shift the total value around anyway - including any general "shying away", as you put it).  Saying it another way:  the value of bitcoin depends on external long term factors - utility for transactions, store of wealth, etc.  If you believe that only one chain will survive, then none of these external factors have changed - and the total value of bitcoin cannot change, even though it is temporarily split across the two chains.\n\nAll this means Bob knows he can later sell his 1 BTC for 1 BTC - whether it is his holding on chain A, or on B or, if they are co-existing, on both.  It just depends on him being able to own the utxos of both Alice\'s transactions.  Here\'s where my knowledge runs out.  Could wallets be developed that would hold keys for both chains?': 2, 'But bitcoin  and litecoin *already* are two incompatible chains. As incompatible as you can get. ;D': 1, '> But, depending on how the new software is written, transaction requests may cointinue to be valid to both versions, and may be executed on both chains.\n\nThat is confusing hard and soft forks, and executing them in a flawed fashion in any case.

Then the (market) value of 1 BTC in A will be p, and the market value of 1 BTC in B will be 1-p. The total value of Bob's bitcoin is p+1-p=1 !!\n\nWell, that is a good guess.  But the price is totally arbitrary anyway, so it will depend on the spin that people will put on the fork.\n\nThe pessimists claim that the mere fact that the coin has forked destroys the confidence in scarcity etc. so the price of both coins would crash.\n\nOn the other hand, most bitcoin users do not follow the technical discussions, and for them a bitcoin would be a bitcoin, so why should it suddenly be worth less?  When a government prints more of its currency and uses it to pay salaries and purchases, it may take some time for its purchasing power to drop to the level expected from its scarcity and use.  The same may happen with bitcoin, so that P_A + P_B may be more than the price P before the fortk.\n\nAlso, pundits may explain to the bitcoin plebeians that the change to 20 MB (or whatever is changed by the fork) is very good for bitcoin because it increases the potetial traffic 20x etc.  That may result in the price of the 20 MB bitcon to be higher than the price of the 1 MB bitcoin before the fork.": 1, 'Please tell that to all the posters who keep assuming that trnsactions will be executed both in the 1 MB and in the 20 MB fork, if they use only pre-fork UTXOs as inputs.': 1, "> You definitely could do it that way\n\nOK thanks, this was the main thing I wanted to know with all this.  So, that being the case, is this not what *will* happen, assuming it is technically feasible?  Eg won't wallets be developed that are fork-independent?  It seems to me this basically nullifies the risk of a hard fork.  I haven't heard that reflected in the general discussion.  Or is there something else? \n\n> I think it would be more accurate to consider what coins in each fork are worth, and how much the recipient may or may not value them. \n\nAh, yes, this is interesting!  Suppose the expected probability that A will win is p.  Then the (market) value of 1 BTC in A will be p, and the market value of 1 BTC in B will be 1-p.  The total value of Bob's bitcoin is p+1-p=1 !!\n\nSo we have a kind of parallel track development for bitcoin.  The total value will be the same, but it will be probabilistically distributed across the competing forks.  As long as everyone is transacting across both, it doesn't matter.  Miners will ultimately decide which live or die.. ..but is this also a way of enabling more organic evolution? \n\n> It would be just like if today Alice has both bitcoin and litecoin\n\nFeels like a difference is the common root that bitcoins A and B have?  Eg you can't say anything about the total value of the bitcoin and litecoin, but I feel you can about bitcoins A and B.\n": 1, 'The worst case is having two *semi-compatible* chains so that when you issue a transaction request you will have no idea of whether it will be valid and executed on chain A, on chain B, on both chains, or in neither.  And you will have no way to recover from whatever mess you happen to get yourself into.  (The *really* worst case is when the core devs will try to hide from you that there are two chains, because that would be an "image problem".)\n\nAssuming that the network is cleanly split, and transaction signatures are version-salted so that no "bad samaritan" can set up a gateway automatically copying requests between the two chains, and the "true bitcoiners" have made such a fuss about the fork that both chains retain a substantial fraction of the hashpower, then the two versions will be as independent as bitcoin and litecoin.\n\nYou will be able to send either version of the coin to other addresses by using the proper version of the software, and the receiving party will have to use the same version in order to see and use them. \n\nPerhaps there will be at least one exchange opting to operate on each branch; or some enterprising exchange may offer trading in both coins.  In either case, you must be careful to use the right version of the software when depositing coins at the exchange; and any coins that you withdraw will be available only in the corresponding branch. \n\nEach coin will have its own market value, that will evolve independently. I guess that the sum of the prices of "bitcoin A" and "bitcoin B" will be at most equal to the bitcoin price before the fork; but, considering that the price is not pegged to anything, and that the price of bitcoins packaged as GBTC is still 70 $/\xc9\x83 higer than market,  anything may happen.\n\nHowever, if the transition is properly implemented as a neat network split, it is quite likely that almost all players will upgrade their software to the new version, or almost none will.  As soon as a miner or holder of bitcoins perceives that it will be in the minority side, he will almost certainly swicth before the scheduled forking time, out of self-interest; and will then speak out in defense of the majority side.  Then one of the two bitcoins will immediately become unusable and worthless, and almost all players will go through the fork without a glitch or jolt, and without having to do or know anything special.': 3, "Yes.  After fork send bitcoins to another address you have the private key for.

If you don\'t first taint those coins, you essentially transfer that "dual chain spending" power to the recipient that you paid.  \n\nSo even if you are "large blocksize supporter", if there is a not-insignificant value for the coins newly mined on the original chain (where the 1MB limit is still enforced) then you want to hold them (or sell them), so you\'ll need to get your coins tainted (with newly mined coins from the larger blocksize side) so that you can make payments on the new fork yet still retain the value of the bitcoins unspent on the original chain.\n\nIf instead exchanges, merchants, etc. only accept payments that confirm on both sides that means they are accepting transactions with only (untainted) pre-fork coins.  That\'s a problem because then there\'s no real market for the newly mined and tainted coins.  And why mine if the coins mined have no significant value?': 1, "> Well, that is a good guess. \n\nNo, it is logically required, I think.

You always sum to $220 by definition.\n \n> On the other hand, most bitcoin users do not follow the technical discussions, and for them a bitcoin would be a bitcoin, so why should it suddenly be worth less? \n\nNote that they would in fact own 2 bitcoins, one on each chain - though they maybe don't even have to know this.  The value of their holdings will be the value of both.  That gives you your (implicit) underlying price for undivided bitcoin - and, if nothing changes, this would be the price on the single chain that emerges.  \n\n": 1, "But, depending on how the new software is written, *transaction requests* may cointinue to be valid to both versions, and may be executed on both chains.  \n\nSome posters seem to think that this double-execution would be good.  To me, it seems total nonsense. \n\nMoreover, in the case of a block increase, without special precautions the blocks mined by the old miners (all with 1 MB max size) will be recognized as valid by the new miners too, except for the fact that the new miners also recognize as valid another chain branch (that starts with an oversize block) and is longer than the old miners' branch.  If the latter happens to grow longer, even the new miners will abandon their branch and try to extend the old one.  \n\nThat would be chaos.  A hard fork must be triggered by block number (not some unpredictable criterion, like 80% adoption) and must be a complete and permanent network split.": 1, '>  will only create clients intended to transact one or the other coin, for the sake of minimizing confusion\n\nYes, that is what I see as the only sane alternative.  But it seems that many posters are assuming that transactions requests will be untagged, so that each network will accept or reject them depending only on whether the UTXOs used as inputs exist on the respective chains.  They do not seem to be assuming a soft fork, because in their view the blocks themselves would be tagged (or one network will recognize bothm while the other will recognize only their own).  Yes, this "semi-compatibility" does not make sense for me either...\n\nSomeone even claimed that Mircea Popescu has promised that, if transctions are seregated, he will automatically duplicate every transaction from one chain to the other, to frustrate the neat split and force "semi-compatibility".  So I suppose that the signatures in transaction requests for the new coin would have to be salted with the version, to frustrate such frustration attempts...': 1, '> In a "semi-compatible" split, even months after the fork someone could issue a transaction that would be acceptable and executed on both forks.\n\nNo, because that is *by definition* the nature of a hard fork. Transactions on the block chain of one fork are no longer considered valid on the other.  \n\nEDIT: grammar': 1, "Thanks.  Even in the *semi-compatible* split, wouldn't it be possible to ensure what you did was independently valid on both chains?": 2, "If you don't double spend your coins so that you have a different set of utxos on each chain then any transaction you create is valid on both forks and can be mined on both.": 0, "The second you have two incompatible chains, you'd better get your ass into *Litecoin.*": 0, 'It\'d be best coming concisely from a core dev.  \n\nActually, what you just wrote is possible in a number of ways. Say after the fork we call each resulting branch bitcoin-A and bitcoin-B. I\'m anticipating that wallet makers will only create clients intended to transact one or the other coin, for the sake of minimizing confusion. In this case, to get your suggested transaction happening on both forks virtually at once, you\'d simply send the same transaction twice, once from a bitcoin-A wallet, and once from a bitcoin-B wallet (by transaction, I mean sending the same UTXOs to the same destination address(es) on both chains -- of course the raw transactions themselves will be different, as generated by each fork\'s client).  \n\nIn fact, you could always build a wallet that executes transactions on both forks almost simultaneously (assuming the UTXOs are available on both forks), but that\'d really be asking for trouble.  \n\nEDIT: I suck at grammar, and added what I specifically meant by "transaction"': 1, "Yes that is kind of what I am getting at.  But I'm more thinking of the recipient of the coins really.\n\nEg Alice gets 1 BTC *today*, when there is a single chain.  Some point in the future wants to send it to Bob to pay for a book.  But there's a hard fork in progress, two clients being used and the blocks they mine are incompatible.  It is expected that one will die out but they aren't sure which.  Alice just wants the book but Bob needs to worry about the transaction going on the wrong chain.  So, question: can Alice say it's OK, I will do two transactions, one with each client, one in each chain.  Both will use the same 1 BTC.  There isn't a problem with double spending because the clients are incompatible anyway (there are two networks and two blockchains).  Whichever chain lives, Bob has his 1 BTC in it.\n\n(Still just questions, I don't know this stuff)": 1, 'I realized I did not respond to the part of your question about hedging in my other comment.  \n\nIf after a fork, you only use your coins on one of the two block chains *you will automatically have a hedge in the unused coins on the other block chain*. So if it turns out the economy of the fork you start using is the wrong one, and it starts to lose to the other fork, your unused coins will just be gaining in value.  \n\nIt seems to me the only way this hedge could be completely lost is if you immediately exchanged all your bitcoin on one fork for the incompatible bitcoin on the other fork, and then it turns out you bet on the wrong fork to begin with. This would only be possible if an exchange were to offer that trading capability very soon after after the fork occurred.': 1, '> So, that being the case, is this not what will happen, assuming it is technically feasible?  \n\nMy personal prediction is that a hard fork won\'t happen until there is pretty good consensus in the community for one fork or another. In this case, we may already be pretty close now. Several polls I\'ve seen have support for some kind of fork to increase block size at 80% to 90%. However, it\'s important to realize these are not scientific or representative polls. There are also developers, businesses, international communities, miners, etc. to consider. Still, assuming there is already well over half of the total Bitcoin community in support of a fork to larger blocks, those large-block-bitcoins should start the post-fork era with greater value, more ways to transact, and more hashing power. Right away, they should be seen as more useful and valuable than those of the 1 MB fork. Barring any unforeseen factors, that would imply the 1 MB fork would rapidly lose value in comparison.  \n\n> Eg won\'t wallets be developed that are fork-independent? It seems to me this basically nullifies the risk of a hard fork.  \n\nNot sure what you mean by "fork-independent", but I expect wallets after the fork to only work on one fork or the other. Or if the developers of a particular wallet, say Electrum, decides to support both forks, each version would be clearly specified. There still are risks in a hard fork, but the risks that exist do seem manageable.  \n\n> The total value of Bob\'s bitcoin is p+1-p=1 !!  \n\nKeep in mind that would only be an approximation, as the real value of either coin would be established on the free market. Such markets are notoriously hard to predict. For instance, someone could come up with a use-case for the 1 MB fork that no one anticipated, giving it more value, but not necessarily stealing value from the large block fork at the same time. In such a scenario p+1-p could end up being > 1 after an influx of investment.  \n\n> Eg you can\'t say anything about the total value of the bitcoin and litecoin, but I feel you can about bitcoins A and B.  \n\nAgain, I think my bitcoin/litecoin analogy applies because market valuations after the fork may not be entirely as expected. One counter example to the one I gave above would be if risk-averse investors shy away from both large-block-bitcoin and 1 MB bitcoin after the fork. If that\'s happens and it\'s also the biggest influence on market price at the time, the value of both forks together could fall to less than that of bitcoin as a whole before the fork. It\'s anyone\'s guess exactly how it will shake out. The one aspect that seems a fairly safe bet to me is that the fork with greater initial value and utility will tend to dominate the other fork, and the value of the dominated fork will drop, if not to zero, at least to a much smaller figure before reaching any equilibrium.': 1, 'Semi-compatible chains simply cannot happen because no node on one post-fork block chain will accept or validate a block from the other post-fork chain.': 1, 'While I agree that holdings in both chains represent hedges of the other, I have to disagree that the possibility of success or failure of the two forks must simply sum to 1. Actually, it\'s quite possible, however unlikely, for both forks to fail or for both to succeed in the long run.  \n\nWallets already exist that can hold several different cryptocurrencies, so there\'s no reason you can\'t make a wallet that "holds" the balances for each of this fork\'s block chains. However, in this case I think doing so would be very bad practice simply because of the confusion that could be generated.  \n\nEDIT: changed a word': 1, '> Transactions that are acceptable and that can be mined on one of the post-fork chains will be considered invalid on the other chain.\n\nNot necessarily *every* transaction request, right?  In a "semi-compatible" split, even months after the fork someone could issue a transaction that would be acceptable and executed on both forks.\n\nI cannot even think about the mess that a "semi-compatible" split could create.  I do not see how one could recover from such a mess even if one of the coins died out.\n\n> Any blocks mined post-fork on one chain would be considered invalid by nodes on the other fork.\n\nBut, depending on how a "semi-compatible" split is done, the miners running the new version of the software would still recognize the blocks in the old branch as valid, and only ignore them as long as their own branch is longer.  If the old miners manage to grow their branch faster than the new miners grow theirs, the new miners wil abandon their branch and start mining at the end of the old one.  Then transctions could become unconfirmed after dozens of confirmations on the new chain...': 1, 'This is impossible because it is by definition why a hard fork diverges. Transactions that are acceptable and that can be mined on one of the post-fork chains will be considered invalid on the other chain. Any blocks mined post-fork on one chain would be considered invalid by nodes on the other fork.': 3, "You definitely could do it that way, but I think it would be more accurate to consider what coins in each fork are worth, and how much the recipient may or may not value them.  \n\nFor instance, the recipient may be a believer in one fork but expect the other to go down in value. In that case he'd just want a little more in coins from just the fork he believes in.  \n\nIt would be just like if today Alice has both bitcoin *and* litecoin. She could pay Bob for the book by sending an amount of bitcoin and of litecoin that together add up to the value of the book, or she could just pay with more of one or the other coin alone. If Bob is a merchant, he may only accept either bitcoin or litecoin, in which case the decision is made for you.": 1, '> No, it is logically required, I think.\n\nBy that logic, BIT shares should be selling for 22 $/share, not 30.  8D\n\nI understand and agree with your arguments.  But markets are irrational, and the price is arbitrary anyway; so I am not sure that the theory would apply in practice...': 1, 'Before the fork you only have bitcoins. After the fork, you\'ll have bitcoin-A and bitcoin-B (the same amount of units in each as you had before in just bitcoin -- so you can think of each satoshi as having split or diverged). From that point on, you\'ll only be able to use bitcoin-A on the fork for bitcoin-A, and bitcoin-B on the fork for bitcoin-B.  \n\nThere would be no need to "double spend" anything (which is actually an incorrect usage of the term "double spend"). If you want to buy something with bitcoin-A, simply send your bitcoin-A to a merchant that accepts bitcoin-A using a bitcoin-A wallet. You can\'t send bitcoin-A directly to a bitcoin-B wallet, or vice versa.  \n\nAnother way to look at it would be that all the private keys and addresses are the same for both bitcoin-A and bitcoin-B, even after the fork. What will have changed is the block chain (the ledger) for each coin, and that\'s how bitcoin-A and bitcoin-B can never get confused.  \n\nTheoretically, bitcoin-A *can* get exchanged for bitcoin-B, but you\'d need to go through a cryptocurrency exchange that supports such a trading pair, since the values for bitcoin-A and bitcoin-B will almost certainly be different immediately after the fork, and those values will continually change against the other. It\'d just be like trading bitcoin right now for litecoin or dogecoin.  \n\n> Can this be mitigated by basically double spending the input (on the common chain) with transactions using both clients, to each of the forks?  \n\nAfter the fork, there will be no such thing as a "common chain". Blocks mined on the bitcoin-A fork that are accepted by bitcoin-A nodes would get rejected by bitcoin-B nodes, and vice versa. For example, at any time after the fork, if you feed bitcoin-B block chain data to a bitcoin-A node, it would immediately fail to confirm any blocks starting from the point where the fork began.  \n\nHow colored coins behave would depend on how each colored coin implementation approaches the issue, but I\'d be shocked if any implementation would choose an approach that would allow confusion between colored coins on each of the post-fork block chains.  \n\nEDIT: clarified that different block chains means different ledgers for bitcoin-A and bitcoin-B': 1}, ('Author of "Breaking Banks", Brett King, dissects the banking industry and Bitcoin\'s future role.', 7): {"I'd recommend his podcast for people who want to learn more about the banking world and FinTech, outside of the Bitcoin bubble.
