I n trade, this is showing up in the emergence of new finacing structures, new technology providing more efficiency in trade processes like blockchain.\nAustralian companies are starting to come to grips with the digital innovation that has come to trade, says Neal Livingstone, Managing Director of Global Trade and Transaction Services, Institutional Banking and Markets, Commonwealth Bank.\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrade finance is very document intensive business, but that is changing in through product innovation, such as the Bank Payment Obligation  (IPO), which is a new automated settlement product \xe2\x80\x93 and through digital and electronic innovation such as the much talked about eBill-bill-of-lading (EBI). These enable fully digitally documented transactions and its quite exciting\xe2\x80\x9d Livingstone says.\nFinancial technology is also stimulating change, he says. \xe2\x80\x9cThe first bit of this is the connection of the traditional Bank-led-trade finance with the alternative investor space. To help achieve capital efficiency, structures and vehicles are being put in place to allow alternative investors to fund trade finance as a new asset class. This is partly a yield play but mostly a diversification play. In this way, the investors can get access to small-to medium-sized enterprise (SME) and mid-cap-type exposures that they don\xe2\x80\x99t typically get in the institutional debt and credit markets\xe2\x80\x9d.\nThe other major innovation taking place is the emergence of "trade portals" through which SME businesses are buying and \nselling across borders. "Alibaba\'s Chinese and Asian business-to-business (B2B) portals are a great example," Livingston says. \n"The neat thing, from a trade finance perspective, is that these portals actually give visibility into the underlying cash flows, \nincluding the tenors, the risks, the payment record and so forth, attendant to those transactions. So the next piece in the value \nchain is trade finance, or supply-chain finance, that involves making an advance on the back of the settlement and is a natural \nadjunct to facilitating the transaction. "It is anticipated that you\'ll have peer-to- peer lenders participating in the portal, and \nwilling to provide capital to fund certain supply-chain activities. \nin Europe right now, where investors can subscribe to the portal and are choosing the sectors and industries they want to support," he says.\n \nLooming behind these developments, says Michael Eidel, executive general manager of Cashflow and Transaction Services, Institutional Banking and Markets, Commonwealth Bank, is blockchain \xe2\x80\x94 a distributed public ledger, peer-to-peer system enabling the verifiable transfer of digital assets. Eidel says blockchain has the potential to "completely revolutionise" trade by allowing \nvalue to be digitised, securely verified and stored, and transferred instantly from one party to another. "If you combine blockchain with the \'internet of things\', the potential exists for even greater benefits for trade participants. For example, through the use of GPS data, you could automatically alert an issuing bank once a shipment arrives at any destination. And if we add sensory \ntechnology to that, we could have real-time monitoring of the condition of the delivered anywhere along its journey." \n\nThat opens up the ability to introduce \'smart contracts\', which involve more specific built-in parameters, Eidel says. \n"At the moment, trade contracts have some contingency because no-one exactly knows the condition of the goods when they are in transit and are handed over from one related party to the next along the delivery chain. If you can measure that throughout the journey, with the data stored centrally or blockchain, contracts can become much \nmore specific and the costs to participants can come down significantly," he says. "Blockchain is going to have an amazing \namount of uses. If we think of the trade finance space everyone that is party to the trade transaction \xe2\x80\x94 banks, exporters, importers, producers, the end user will have decentralised access to all contractual agreements, all identities, all documents through the blockchain. \n\n"So when you consider the comparative simplicity of using an integrated system that tracks transactions along the supply chain, \nand the associated cost reduction and ability for self-service for its participants, it is clear that blockchain has the potential to \nfundamentally change the business model of global trade," Eidel says. \n': 1}, ('Running a Bitcoin Full Node Over Tor (Bitseed)', 1): {}, ("Who's Afraid of P2P?", 0): {}, ('Getting a "Bad Recovery Phrase" message when trying to restore my wallet on a different device', 1): {'You likely transposed two words or wrote one down wrong.

This is very costly, which if you just used it to mine bitcoins instead of trying to reverse transactions you'd probably make more money anyway.\n\nMore technical info: mining is basically generating random numbers, running them through a one-way function and checking if the result is statistically unlikely (turns it into a sort of lottery, with more hashing power making it more likely you'll find a block).\n\nexample:\n\n* hash input: j9f3jfas\n* hash output: b2c7646dde8319b025a2b6680c784b808b582029e74d58fd82481fc46263e160\n\n(note: I used normal sha256, not the variant bitcoin uses)\n\nSince this does not match the current requirements for a found hash (needs to have a certain number of 0s, basically), you have to try again and that input is worthless.\n\nNow part of the input must come from the block before it, so once a new block is announced, it's everyone's chance again because no one will know what the new block's portion of the input will be until it's found.": 1, "You have millions upon millions to invest, and you research and deploy cutting edge mining chips in the thousands, somewhere where electricity is cheap and you can afford the time to manage and the money to pay a large crew to run the show.

Typically a private key relates to a single address, this address should only be used once to send funds from as an enhanced security feature should ECDSA be broken in future.  Most wallets do this by default so you don't need to worry but what this means is every time a transaction is done the full amount at that address is transferred to at least two addresses (1 to who you're paying, and the other is your change address where any remaining funds from the original transaction are sent back to).\nThis change address uses a different private key from your source address.  Bitcoind wallet forinstance always generates 100 future addresses in the wallet for these change addresses, this typically means you can do up to 100 transactions and still restore from a backup and it'll magically still have access to all your bitcoin even at the new addresses that weren't there when you last made your backup.\n\n\nIf however you do 101 transactions with the bitcoind client and lose your wallet/restore that old backup... all the funds that were sent to the address in 101 will be lost forever as your backup has no knowledge of this 101st change address hence why backups are encouraged regularly.\n\n\nTypically I think most people now use HD or multisig HD wallets now anyhow so isn't an issue but worth calling out if anyone is using bitcoind to store funds.\n": 2, 'Yes, your mnemonic seed will recover the money.

Even if it were so, who thinks these guys are that childish?? And talks about beliefs about BIP101. The fact is, these things need *analyzing.* Not beliefs. That is why BIP101 wasn\'t/isn\'t widely accepted by community (hasn\'t gained consensus) nor is merged into Bitcoin Core. BIP101 simply needs more analyzing. We don\'t know what are the consequences, one can just guess. And as there\'s no immediate need, it\'s better to try to fix the problem with smarter solutions. \n\nAlso:\n\n>But there is a fatal flaw in this position. A voluntary (non-fiat) currency which is not widely accepted, or believed to be headed toward wide acceptance, will lose.\n\nIn that sense Bitcoin has already lost. Fiat currencies have more acceptance. A less decentralized, trust-needing cryptocurrencies will come and they may easily bypass Bitcoins popularity, just because less decentralized systems can do some things more efficiently. And sadly majority of the people of the world value those things more. As an example, cheap transactions, fast transactions, microtransactions, mobile systems, ease of use, reverseability and so on. Bitcoin offers good things for those who value *censorship resistance for all* the most. 100% trustlessness is the most important thing Bitcoin has, everything else comes after that. 99% trustlessness is simply not enough since then you (or 1/100 of the people) **need** to trust someone else to use the system - and that opens up ways to restrict usage for some.\n\nOne can argue that 99% trustlessness is just fine. Huge majority of the users can use the system without problems. Too bad for the 1% who are banned from using the system. Bitcoin is not that kind of system and doesn\'t need to become like that. BIP101 is a path towards that kind of environment, *in my opinion*, and I think many (or majority of bitcoin community) share this or similar opinion. 4-8MB *now* would possibly be just fine, after same adjustions or even without, though.\n\nOK, then the next comment after that... https://np.reddit.com/r/bitcoinxt/comments/3wdhlf/luke_jr_my_goal_is_to_work_on_improving_bitcoin/cxvallc\n\n>In a matter of 2 comments, Luke Jr. has destroyed any benefit of the doubt that I might have given to him.\n\nAlright. You\'re talking about one of the most active Bitcoin developers / maintainers. Some respect, no?\n\nThen 3rd comment (https://np.reddit.com/r/bitcoinxt/comments/3wdhlf/luke_jr_my_goal_is_to_work_on_improving_bitcoin/cxvd5h4) is just so delusional and disrespectful I don\'t want to say anything about it, so I\'ll skip to the 4th.\n\n4th comment: https://np.reddit.com/r/bitcoinxt/comments/3wdhlf/luke_jr_my_goal_is_to_work_on_improving_bitcoin/cxvgif6\n\n>Bitcoin has been working fine for the past few years, and probably doesn\'t need a whole lot of "improvement" beyond simply more people using it.\n\nUnder constant development and improvement it has been working fine. It\'s nowhere near finished. It\'s not even at version 1.0 yet! And for sure it needs lots and lots of improvement before all the major issues are fixed for good. Lots of those issues only start to show when Bitcoin grows a lot so it may be easy to think Bitcoin code is finished already.\n\nAnyway, the OP in that thread is somewhat reasonable and seems to listen & understand answers.

At least comments try to ridicule with that.. But no, sadly there are trolls who want to make it serious. For example, /u/hellobitcoinworld rises to write a comment only to mock theymos. And allegations and assumptions that *everyone* hates theymos, like it\'s just a fact. Newcomers and people who don\'t actively follow will get their view about this by reading those shitty comments.\n\nThen someone goes and tells that it doesn\'t matter who sent the e-mail. And that follows with lots of theymos-hate. I see my own comment there, just trying to make at least some people see what\'s going on (or how I see these things.) Why I answered exactly that post? The guy states "obvious" things as facts which are lies and/or opinions (based on lies), just like that.

Perhaps hash rate can be viewed as a temporary representation of marginal cost. I understand that over time marginal cost decreases at a constant hash rate due to technology advances, but in the short term, say a few months, the hash rate could be a proxy for marginal cost. \n\nIt is a fact that hash rate is stickier than price. Meaning that the change in hash rate lags the change in price. However, Satoshi wrote that in the long term the value of bitcoin would equal the marginal cost, or the the point where the Marginal Cost equaled the Marginal Revenue. \n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profit_maximization\n\nI'm also fairly certain that miners are heavy in the futures markets, hedging their operations and production. As you probably know, futures were originally designed to hedge future production and insure investment in the capital means of production in other industries (particularly farming). So the hash rate could be priced in, in futures and not directly in the sale of fresh coins on the market. Futures would give miners the needed time to adjust their hash rate (or marginal cost).\n\nAnyway, valuable discussion.\n\n": 1}, ("he's not satoshi, he's a very naughty boy.", 0): {}, ('Just think we deserve an explanation of how Craig S Wright ended up on that panel', 253): {'"Don\'t worry Craig, you\'ll skype in on a laptop."\n\nPuts him on side the of the building.
