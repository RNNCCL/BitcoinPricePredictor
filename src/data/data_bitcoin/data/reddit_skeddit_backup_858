You have to think differently and think about "What can I buy with X amount of Y currency?".

This means that the amount of "stuff" 1 BTC can buy in 2018, will only slightly diminish over time compared to USD or most other currencies. This, coupled with the inflation of popular fiat currencies such as the Dollar, means that the number of Dollars 1 BTC will be able to purchase, will naturally slightly rise over time.

The actual *stuff* that BTC can purchase will stay exactly the same. Outside value has to be put into Bitcoin for stuff/BTC to rise and that\'s really what hodlers want.\n\nThe USD cost for an item isn\'t particularly interesting to people holding large sums of BTC since stuff/BTC will naturally stay the same as the market adjusts.\n\nI can only suggest that people who hold BTC stop worrying about month-to-month fluctuation and spend more time looking at the long term and how the protocol develops and matures.\n\nForget months or weeks and start counting in years.

Under no circumstances would I advise storing encryption keys on a cloud, especially one that also stores files it was used to encrypt, store them on flash drives in a fire/water proof chest (available at Walmart for less than $50) along with a printed copy of the private key so that in the event that every backup of the keys fails you can still type it in by hand to restore it.

Among pyrrolobenzodiazepines, cardiotoxicity is associated with hydroxylation at position 9. Deletion of the methyltransferase gene sibL abolishes the production of sibiromycin. Supplementation of growth media with 4-methylanthranilic acid can substitute for its native 3-hydroxy congener that is natively produced. Cultures grown in this fashion yielded 9-deoxysibiromycin. In this study, we characterize the structure and biological activity of sibiromycin and 9-deoxysibiromycin methyl carbinolamines. Preliminary in vitro evidence suggests that 9-deoxysibiromycin exhibits reduced cardiotoxicity while gaining antitumor activity. These results strongly support further exploration of the production and evaluation of monomeric and dimeric glycosylated pyrrolobenzodiazepine analogs of sibiromycin.\n\nThis figure was particularly nice: http://imgur.com/QZPFzDT\n\n- ACS Biology has an impact factor of 5.356 and is a respectable journal.

However, I feel there is not enough *in vitro* data, let alone *in vivo* data, on the effects of 9DS on normal healthy cells and in comparison to other anti-cancer agents. Therefore, it is hard for me to judge whether it is worth investing/developing an easier way to synthesize this compound without this crucial bit of data. I can understand this project from the point of view that they want an easier way to batch produce more 9DS to obtain that data.... if so, I'd like to know what collaborations they have lined up to do that, given that their lab's expertise appears to be focused on synthesis **and** if/why they can't synthesize enough to obtain that preliminary data.": 3, "It's pointless.": -1, 'Why?

That IS all you got? LOL.': 0, 'I  can tell you 100% this is not FUD.   I have had the same issue.': 1, "hi there.

Over and over, the same crap complaints... \n\nStop trying to make huge buys bigger than your normal buys when the price tanks or starts shooting up, as that is not what Coinbase is for, and you will most likely stop having these problems. Use a real exchange with a predefined ask and bid if you want a guaranteed price and sale. Is that more difficult?
