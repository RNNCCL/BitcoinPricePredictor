Deflation, the Economist recently proclaimed, is a \xe2\x80\x9cpernicious threat\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cthe world\xe2\x80\x99s biggest economic problem.\xe2\x80\x9d Christine Lagarde , managing director of the International Monetary Fund, called deflation an \xe2\x80\x9cogre\xe2\x80\x9d that could \xe2\x80\x9cprove disastrous for the recovery.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTrue, a sudden, large and sharp collapse in prices, such as occurred in the early 1920s and 1930s, would be a problem: Debtors might fail, some prices and wages might not adjust quickly enough. But these deflations resulted directly from financial panics, when central banks couldn\xe2\x80\x99t or didn\xe2\x80\x99t accommodate a sudden demand for money.\n\nThe worry today is a slow slide toward falling prices, maybe 1% to 2% annually, with perpetually near-zero short-term interest rates. This scenario would unfold alongside positive, if sluggish, growth, ample money and low credit spreads, with financial panic long passed. And slight deflation has advantages. Milton Friedman long ago recognized slight deflation as the \xe2\x80\x9coptimal\xe2\x80\x9d monetary policy, since people and businesses can hold lots of cash without worrying about it losing value. So why do people think deflation, by itself, is a big problem?\n\n1) Sticky wages. A common story is that employers are loath to cut wages, so deflation can make labor artificially expensive. With product prices falling and wages too high, employers will cut back or close down.\n\nSticky wages would be a problem for a sharp 20% deflation. But not for steady 2% deflation. A typical worker\xe2\x80\x99s earnings rise around 2% a year as he or she gains experience, and another 1%\xe2\x80\x94hopefully more\xe2\x80\x94from aggregate productivity growth. So there could be 3% deflation before a typical worker would have to take a wage cut. And the typical worker also changes jobs, and wages, every 4\xc2\xbd years. Moreover, \xe2\x80\x9ctypical\xe2\x80\x9d is the middle of a highly volatile distribution of wage changes among a churning job market. Ultimately very few additional workers would have to take nominal wage cuts to accommodate 2% deflation.\n\nCuriously, if sticky wages are the central problem, why do we not hear any loud cries to unstick wages: lower minimum wages, less unionization, less judicial meddling in wages such as comparable worth and disparate-impact discrimination suits, fewer occupational licenses and so forth?\n\n2) Monetary policy headroom. The Federal Reserve wants a 2% inflation rate. That\xe2\x80\x99s because with \xe2\x80\x9cnormal\xe2\x80\x9d 4% interest rates, the Fed will have some room to lower interest rates when it wants to stimulate the economy. This is like the argument that you should wear shoes two sizes too small, because it feels so good to take them off at night.\n\nThe weight you put on this argument depends on how much good rather than mischief you think the Fed has achieved by raising and lowering interest rates, and to what extent other measures like quantitative easing can substitute when rates are stuck at zero. In any case, establishing some headroom for stimulation in the next recession is not a big problem today.\n\n3) Debt payments. The story here is that deflation will push debtors, and indebted governments especially, to default, causing financial crises. When prices fall unexpectedly, profits and tax revenues fall. Costs also fall, but required debt payments do not fall.\n\nAgain, a sudden, unexpected 20% deflation is one thing, but a slow slide to 2% deflation is quite another. A 100% debt-to-GDP ratio is, after a year of unexpected 2% deflation, a 102% debt-to-GDP ratio. You\xe2\x80\x99d have to go decades like this before deflation causes a debt crisis.\n\nStrangely, in the next breath deflation worriers tell governments to deliberately borrow lots of money and spend it on stimulus. This was the centerpiece of the IMF\xe2\x80\x99s October World Economic Outlook antideflation advice. The IMF at least seemed to realize this apparent inconsistency, claiming that spending would be so immensely stimulative that it would pay for itself.\n\n4) Deflation spiral. Keynesians have been warning of a \xe2\x80\x9cdeflation spiral\xe2\x80\x9d since Japanese interest rates hit zero two decades ago. Here\xe2\x80\x99s the story: Deflation with zero interest is the same thing as a high interest rate with moderate inflation: holding either money or zero-interest rate bonds, you can buy more next year. This incentive stymies \xe2\x80\x9cdemand,\xe2\x80\x9d as people postpone consumption. Falling demand causes output to fall, more deflation, and the economy spirals downward.\n\nIt never happened. Nowhere, ever, has an economy such as ours or Europe\xe2\x80\x99s, with fiat money, an interest-rate target, massive excess bank reserves and outstanding government debt, experienced the dreaded deflation spiral. Not even Japan, though it has had near-zero inflation for two decades, experienced the predicted spiral.\n\nThere are good reasons to believe it can\xe2\x80\x99t happen. Most of all, government solvency fears that don\xe2\x80\x99t matter for 2% deflation kick in and stop a deflation spiral. If prices fall 20%, or 30%, bond-holders will see that governments cannot pay back debts. They try to get rid of their bonds before the coming default. They buy things or other currencies, nipping the deflation spiral in the bud.\n\nThere is an unsettling feature of the current inflation situation, however. Clearly, our central banks want higher inflation, and the current slow decline was unintended. So, just as clearly, central banks have a lot less understanding of and control over inflation and deflation than most people think.\n\nAccording to the conventional worldview, the economy is inherently unstable. Central banks control inflation the way you balance an upside-down broom, with interest rates on the bottom and inflation on top. Central banks have to actively move interest rates around to keep inflation and deflation from breaking out. And if they want more inflation, they must temporarily move interest rates the wrong way, let the inflation increase, and then move quickly to stabilize it.\n\nHence the zero-bound worry. When interest rates hit zero and the Fed can\xe2\x80\x99t move the broom handle any more, the top of the broom must topple into deflation. Except we hit the zero bound, and almost nothing happened. Maybe the economy isn\xe2\x80\x99t so inherently unstable and in need of constant guidance after all.\n\nBottom line? Relax. Every few months we hear a new \xe2\x80\x9cbiggest economic problem\xe2\x80\x9d from which our \xe2\x80\x9cpolicy makers\xe2\x80\x9d must save us.

Economists don\'t claim that a small amount of deflation causes depression, just like small amounts of inflation don\'t either. They argue that small amounts of inflation is preferable to small amounts of deflation, and that runaway inflation is much easier to remedy than runaway deflation.\n\nSorry but you\'re 100% wrong about the Spanish empire, it is one of the better studied empires by economists. The general consensus is that Spain did a number of things which caused the empire to become unstable and eventually dissolve.\n\n1) The aristocrats were seeing a lot of silver and gold come back from the new world, and decided it would be a good idea to invest the majority of their wealth into these operations to get even more silver and gold. The problem being they completely ignored growing domestic infrastructure and human capital which caused a number of recessions as they were overwhelmed with silver but had no local production.\n\n2) Spain decided to fight endless costly wars all throughout Europe and the new world.  This is the time period you reference where the majority of the debasement occurred. Most of the economic literature I\'ve read concerning this time period is an agreement that debasement did not contribute in any meaningful way to inflation. If Spain would have used their increased money supply to grow their production or build infrastructure they would have been pretty prosperous. Instead the chose to waste their new-found spending power on costly wars which led to extreme inflation and a breakdown of the local economy. It\'s these wars that are almost universally cited as the main cause of the Habsburgs\' decline.\n\n3) Because Spain wasted so much of their wealth fighting wars they were in a tight spot economically and politically. The Habsburgs were in the midst of a credit crisis and were having a tough time financing domestic projects and expeditions abroad. People they could once borrow from were turning them away because of political instability. In addition to this, the Habsburgs made many mistakes managing their accounts which led to a number of defaulted loans and eventual bankruptcy.\n\n4) With a declining economy Spain found it hard to retain power over their colonies which by this time had become the majority of their income (the aristocrats saw manual labor as dishonorable and instead invested in imports). They found themselves fighting refitted Dutch and French fleets which caused them to lose power over many of their most profitable trade routes and ultimately give up a lot of their territories. It was all of these events coinciding with debasing their currency which caused inflation and economic problems.\n\nNo obviously they don\'t but all loans have risk and default is always a possibility, that\'s not even the point I made which you\'ve seemed to miss entirely. Why would a rational actor enter into an agreement where he is working against his own interests. The reality is in a deflationary system huge risk is shifted from institutional banks onto the backs of the borrower. If you take a loan with a fixed interest rate you know exactly what the maximum real value interest rate is going to be in an inflationary system. If you take a loan at a fixed rate in a deflationary system you have no idea what the maximum real value interest rate will be, unless you can magically predict how much production will grow. This is how **everyone** who gets an appreciable loan thinks. In fact, it\'s **literally** the loan officers job to go over these types of things with you and make sure you understand them. The fact you don\'t know this pretty much destroys what little credibility you had left.

Inflation makes it easier to pay off debts. During times of inflation the lender takes real value losses and the borrower receives real value gains. Inflation happens when the money supply grows faster than production which causes prices and wages to rise (although not always proportionally).\n\nIn a deflationary system lenders take real value gains and borrowers take real value losses. Since deflation increases the strength of a currency prices and wages fall which increases the real price of credit. This is a major reason why deflationary currencies don't work, because credit becomes nearly impossible to secure and those who borrow money take losses if the economy grows. So assuming someone borrows money to do something useful like start a business of get an education, they will be working against their own interests if their actions strengthen the economy.\n\nThis is Econ 101 stuff, I seriously can't believe people in this sub are still getting this stuff wrong.": 2, "That's not how loans work. You can't just change the interest terms after the loan as been finalized. The only situation where an example like that is even remotely applicable is with ARMs which are pretty uncommon in the US now after the housing bubble. Plus with ARMs its a lot more complicated than simply inflation = increased interest rates. Most arms have annualized caps or maximum caps over the lifetime of the loan; again, which is agreed upon before the loan is finalized and cannot be changed.\n\nHere's how it actually works in a simplified example:\n\nTotal money supply = $10,000\nWeekly wage = $100\nCost of widgets = $15\n\nNow I take out a loan for $500, with an APY of 50% with a agreement I'll pay off the loan in 1 year ($750). During that year there is runaway inflation and the money supply triples while the economy stays the same. Now we're looking at a situation like:\n\nTotal money supply = $30,000\nWeekly wage = $300\nCost of widgets = $45\n\nNow you see that the loan would have taken me 7.5 weeks to pay off in the pre-inflation economy, whereas it will only take me 2.5 weeks after inflation. Furthermore, the lender took a real value loss as the principle + interest is worth less than the original principle. The borrower, assuming he spent the money before inflation took place, received a real value gain as he was able to buy twice as many widgets with the loan, than the amount he paid backed.": 1, 'The Bitcoin tip for a banana (1,406 bits/$0.53) has been collected by *solled*.\n\n\n[ChangeTip info](https://www.changetip.com/tip-online/reddit) | [ChangeTip video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AnfKpypMNw) | /r/Bitcoin': 0, "The IMF and it's version of global currency": 0, "/u/changetip 1000 bits\n\n^ This money could've gone to WSJ if only they'd get with the times.": 5, '58 points and 87% upvoted this link defending one of the biggest criticisms mainstream economists have of bitcoin, after 6 hours.\n\nCats with monocles with "this is gentlemen" text go to the /r/bitcoin front page\'s moon.\n\nThis sub really has its priorities in order.': 1, 'Sorry, but deflation is bad... really bad.\n\n\nif you operate with a debt-based monetary system.

This is from their site:\n\n--------------\n\nSTANDARDS FOR CHARITABLE ACCOUNTABILITY\n\nGOVERNANCE AND OVERSIGHT\n\nThe governing board has the ultimate oversight authority for any charitable organization. This section of the standards seeks to ensure that the volunteer board is active, independent and free of self-dealing. To meet these standards, the organization shall have:\n\n1. A board of directors that provides adequate oversight of the charity's operations and its staff. Indication of adequate oversight includes, but is not limited to, regularly scheduled appraisals of the CEO's performance, evidence of disbursement controls such as board approval of the budget, fund raising practices, establishment of a conflict of interest policy, and establishment of accounting procedures sufficient to safeguard charity finances.\n\n2. A board of directors with a minimum of five voting members.\n\n3. A minimum of three evenly spaced meetings per year of the full governing body with a majority in attendance, with face-to-face participation. A conference call of the full board can substitute for one of the three meetings of the governing body. For all meetings, alternative modes of participation are acceptable for those with physical disabilities.\n\n4. Not more than one or 10% (whichever is greater) directly or indirectly compensated person(s) serving as voting member(s) of the board. Compensated members shall not serve as the board's chair or treasurer.\n[Publicly soliciting churches and other houses of worship: see the Implementation Guide for further information about the application of this standard.]\n\n5. No transaction(s) in which any board or staff members have material conflicting interests with the charity resulting from any relationship or business affiliation. Factors that will be considered when concluding whether or not a related party transaction constitutes a conflict of interest and if such a conflict is material, include, but are not limited to: any arm's length procedures established by the charity; the size of the transaction relative to like expenses of the charity; whether the interested party participated in the board vote on the transaction; if competitive bids were sought and whether the transaction is one-time, recurring or ongoing.\n\nMEASURING EFFECTIVENESS\n\nAn organization should regularly assess its effectiveness in achieving its mission. This section seeks to ensure that an organization has defined, measurable goals and objectives in place and a defined process in place to evaluate the success and impact of its program(s) in fulfilling the goals and objectives of the organization and that also identifies ways to address any deficiencies. To meet these standards, a charitable organization shall:\n\n6. Have a board policy of assessing, no less than every two years, the organization's performance and effectiveness and of determining future actions required to achieve its mission.\n\n7. Submit to the organization's governing body, for its approval, a written report that outlines the results of the aforementioned performance and effectiveness assessment and recommendations for future actions.\n\nFINANCES\n\nThis section of the standards seeks to ensure that the charity spends its funds honestly, prudently and in accordance with statements made in fund raising appeals. To meet these standards, the charitable organization shall:\nPlease note that standards 8 and 9 have different denominators.\n\n8. Spend at least 65% of its total expenses on program activities.\nFormula for Standard 8:\nTotal Program Service Expenses \t  \tshould be at least 65%\nTotal Expenses\n\n9. Spend no more than 35% of related contributions on fund raising. Related contributions include donations, legacies, and other gifts received as a result of fund raising efforts.\nFormula for Standard 9:\nTotal Fund Raising Expenses \t  \tshould be no more than 35%\nTotal Related Contributions\n\n10. Avoid accumulating funds that could be used for current program activities. To meet this standard, the charity's unrestricted net assets available for use should not be more than three times the size of the past year's expenses or three times the size of the current year's budget, whichever is higher.\n[Meeting certain public disclosure requirements described in the Implementation Guide may enable a charity to satisfy this standard.]\n\nAn organization that does not meet Standards 8, 9 and/or 10 may provide evidence to demonstrate that its use of funds is reasonable. The higher fund raising and administrative costs of a newly created organization, donor restrictions on the use of funds, exceptional bequests, a stigma associated with a cause and environmental or political events beyond an organization's control are among factors which may result in expenditures that are reasonable although they do not meet the financial measures cited in these standards.\n\n11. Make available to all, on request, complete annual financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. When total annual gross income exceeds $500,000*, these statements should be audited in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards. For charities whose annual gross income is less than $500,000*, a review by a certified public accountant is sufficient to meet this standard. For charities whose annual gross income is less than $250,000*, an internally produced, complete financial statement is sufficient to meet this standard.\n\n*Note that new financial statement thresholds for Standard 11 are effective for fiscal years ending 12/31/2011 and thereafter.\n\n12. Include in the financial statements a breakdown of expenses (e.g., salaries, travel, postage, etc.) that shows what portion of these expenses was allocated to program, fund raising, and administrative activities. If the charity has more than one major program category, the schedule should provide a breakdown for each category.\n\n13. Accurately report the charity's expenses, including any joint cost allocations, in its financial statements. For example, audited or unaudited statements which inaccurately claim zero fund raising expenses or otherwise understate the amount a charity spends on fund raising, and/or overstate the amount it spends on programs will not meet this standard.\n\n14. Have a board-approved annual budget for its current fiscal year, outlining projected expenses for major program activities, fund raising, and administration.\n\nFUND RAISING AND INFORMATIONAL MATERIALS\n\nA fund raising appeal is often the only contact a donor has with a charity and may be the sole impetus for giving. This section of the standards seeks to ensure that a charity's representations to the public are accurate, complete and respectful. To meet these standards, the charitable organization shall:\n\n15. Have solicitations and informational materials, distributed by any means, that are accurate, truthful and not misleading, both in whole and in part. Appeals that omit a clear description of program(s) for which contributions are sought will not meet this standard.\n\nA charity should also be able to substantiate that the timing and nature of its expenditures are in accordance with what is stated, expressed, or implied in the charity's solicitations.\n\n16. Have an annual report available to all, on request, that includes:\n\n    the organization's mission statement,\n\n    a summary of the past year's program service accomplishments,\n\n    a roster of the officers and members of the board of directors,\n\n    financial information that includes (i) total income in the past fiscal year, (ii) expenses in the same program, fund raising and administrative categories as in the financial statements, and (iii) ending net assets.\n\n17. Include on any charity websites that solicit contributions, the same information that is recommended for annual reports, as well as the mailing address of the charity and electronic access to its most recent IRS Form 990.\n\n18. Address privacy concerns of donors by\n\n    providing in written appeals, at least annually, a means (e.g., such as a check off box) for both new and continuing donors to inform the charity if they do not want their name and address shared outside the organization, and\n    providing a clear, prominent and easily accessible privacy policy on any of its websites that tells visitors (i) what information, if any, is being collected about them by the charity and how this information will be used, (ii) how to contact the charity to review personal information collected and request corrections, (iii) how to inform the charity (e.g., a check off box) that the visitor does not wish his/her personal information to be shared outside the organization, and (iv) what security measures the charity has in place to protect personal information.\n\n19. Clearly disclose how the charity benefits from the sale of products or services (i.e., cause-related marketing) that state or imply that a charity will benefit from a consumer sale or transaction. Such promotions should disclose, at the point of solicitation:\n\n    the actual or anticipated portion of the purchase price that will benefit the charity (e.g., 5 cents will be contributed to abc charity for every xyz company product sold),\n    the duration of the campaign (e.g., the month of October),\n    any maximum or guaranteed minimum contribution amount (e.g., up to a maximum of $200,000).\n\n20.

I don\'t think it affects the quality of assets, though.\n\nWhen I started working on the colored coins projects in 2012, the main motivation was to create a decentralized, unregulated stock exchange. It was the time when GLBSE was closed, so it felt like there is a need in decentralized exchanges.\n\nObviously, it would be very easy to create scam assets on the decentralized exchange, but the hope was that eventually the community will establish standards for verification and reporting, which would ameliorate the problem.\n\nHowever, this year I got completely disillusioned in unregulated stock markets seeing so many failures. The last one was NEO&BEE. It was very visible and public, was endorsed by reputable people in the community, generated a lot of press, run ads on TV. They even talked with Cyprus government.\n\nAnd, it turned out to be a complete scam.

And in 5 years I will tell people "Oh, sorry, my business failed to reach profitability. But you got nice dividend for 5 years, just leave me alone". Obviously, I don\'t need to run any business, I\'ll just get 50 BTC out of it.\n\nSo when you claim that mandatory rewards help to a history of trust, you\'re only helping scammers who can do the math. It is a bad idea.\n\nAnd, yes, there is a plenty of examples of Bitcoin stock issuers who pay dividends for several months (or years) and then disappear or go dormant.\n\nPerhaps the most striking example is [BASIC-MINING](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=130982.980). For the first 8 months it was an exemplary project: it paid dividends on time, met all investor expectations, communicated with investors on forums, posted photos and screenshots. And then when it was announced that btct.co is closing, that guy just disappeared. People later found his real name, and evidence that he was a scammer before this endeavor.\n\nSo I\'d say early dividends are more like a red flag. Sure, you might recover 50% of your initial investment, but if you\'re guaranteed to lose 50%, it\'s a bad idea to invest.

What you have instead is a promise for some bitcoin.\n\nIf you want bitcoin, you also need to ensure the system you hold your keys on is hardened against malware. I built [breadwallet](http://breadwallet.com) for iOS because that platform is locked down and hardened against malware by default, and iOS devices are also hardware encrypted by default, protecting your funds even if the device is stolen. If you use a web or desktop wallet, make sure you know how to harden your system against malware yourself.": 16, "That's why the fucking iTunes backup is encrypted.\n\nYou can permit your data to be backed up in a portable fashion only if encrypted; please do so.": 1, '> A small price to pay\n\nI think giving up your privacy is a high price.\n\nEspecially since I trust my personal wallet more than a custodial account like Xapo.': 6, "Actually if you use Coinbase's multisig vault you do actually have direct access to your bitcoin, becuase you control the private keys, and you don't need to go through them to access it.": 0, "> breadwallet\n\nHi Aaron, it might be a lot to ask, but would it be too complicate to have a version for iOS7.0.4?

': 5, 'Why did you transfer your bits to Xapo and not a personal wallet (like on your phone or pc)?': 3, 'Yup.  A Bitcoin wallet is a public/private key pair (PK, SK).  A Bitcoin address is just the hash of the PK.  To spend, you broadcast the public key associated with an address and "sign" (with the secret key) a message telling the Bitcoin where to go.  Anyone can validate the PK and check that you have the associated SK, and check that the hash of the PK (address) has a balance floating "in space" as you say, confirming that the transaction is valid.  Once it\'s in the blockchain you also can\'t spend those funds again, as they\'re no longer in space.\n\n\nAddresses are not necessarily even associated with a single wallet.  But the probability there will be a collision is infinitesimally small.  \n\n\nSo basically yes, the money is always floating in space.  And you spend it by basically shouting "that piece is mine, send it there!" to the world.  Somehow, everyone agrees and says "yes, that\'s true, we\'ll write it in our books too".

Users are notoriously bad at choosing strong passwords. You're thinking of bitcoin like it's some login credential that you can recover from if it gets hacked. It's not. It's digital cash, and requires a much higher standard of security. Your keys are stored in the secure enclave which is a custom, tamper resistant secure hardware chip, and then also off device with your backup phrase on paper. If there's a cross device backup stored on your desktop, you've reduced your security to the level of any other desktop wallet, vulnerable to desktop malware that either cracks your weak password offline or waits for you to type it in.": 1, "Don't hold bitcoin on jailbroken phones.

If an attacker has the unlock info of your phone, they also have the hardware decryption key.  What would stop an attack that goes something like (backup app data) -> (bruteforce PIN, restoring app data if too many incorrect guesses results in a wipe)?\n\n\nGlad you're also looking into deterministic builds and verify the version posted in the app store, those are great steps for the average user (as you say you are targeting).  But this is r/Bitcoin and we all know that trusting a third party with closed source software (Apple) to manage the distribution/execution of BTC-related applications could inherently be a security flaw.  It all depends on your risk tolerance - I have a decently sizable ~5BTC in GreenAddress for example and wouldn't think twice about sacrificing the security of signing my transactions offline for the convenience it provides.

"blockchain.info/wallet" implementation), you gonna end up in your mess:\n\n- TX Input = B + C = 7.00010541\n\n- TX fee = 0.00010000 BTC\n\n- TX Output 1 = Z = 7.00000000 BTC\n\n- TX Output 2 = D = 0.00000541 BTC (the change) <--- **DUST**\n\n(Note that this looks the same to the network as if you sent 0.00000541 BTC to someone and 7 BTC is your change)\n\nThere are two (three) ways how a properly programmed wallet can avoid it:\n\nSolution 1:\n\n- TX Input = **A +** B + C = 7.00010549\n\n- TX fee = 0.00010000 BTC\n\n- TX Output 1 = Z = 7.00000000 BTC\n\n- TX Output 2 = D = 0.00000549 BTC (the change) <--- No dust ! (it is >=546 satoshis!)\n \n \nSolution 2 (if you don\'t have the address A in your wallet):\n\n- TX Input = B + C = 7.00010541\n\n- TX fee = **0.00010541** BTC\n\n- TX Output 1 = Z = 7.00000000 BTC\n\n- TX Output 2 = doesn\'t exist (no change, no dust)\n \n \nSolution 3 (not recommended but better than original):\n\n- TX Input = B + C = 7.00010541\n\n- TX fee = 0.00009995 BTC (slightly reduced fee)\n\n- TX Output 1 = Z = 7.00000000 BTC\n\n- TX Output 2 = D = 0.00000546 BTC (the change) <--- No dust ! (it is >=546 satoshis!)\n\nNote that solution 3 has a smaller tx fee than default, but I think(!) this will just get it de-prioritized by the miners and not rejected from the memory pool straight away. So you would wait a few more blocks for the first confirmation, but not hours. When choosing between solution 2 and 3 (if sol. 1 is not possible), the wallet app should default to sol. 2, but in an expert mode could also offer sol. 3.\n\n***Please write to blockchain.info, point them to this post, and ask them to implement this properly (as outlined here) to avoid unnecessary annoyance in user experience (and the unnecessary impression that Bitcoin does not yet work smoothly) for the future.***\n\nThe solution should be like "solution 1", if possible, and otherwise "solution 2" (which is always(!!) possible), or alternatively solution 3, instead of 2, for advanced users.\n\nThe "solution 2" entails a very slightly (but well acceptable) increased Tx fee.\n \n \nPS: To avoid the side effect of slightly increase tx fees for avoiding dust (sol.2) (max. increase by 5.45%), I\'d recommend making sol.3 the default, but this would require changing miner policy such that it is *guaranteed* that miners will not discard a transaction as long as a tx meets the following condition:\n\n(a) either tx_fee >= 0.00010000 BTC (or whatever tx_fee_min is in a particular situation)\n\n(b) or tx_fee + smallest_tx_output > 0.0001000 BTC AND smallest_tx_output==0.00000546 BTC.\n\nIn this case, in the worst case the network would accept a fee reduction by 0.00000545 BTC, e.g. from 0.00010000 to 0.00009455 BTC or a reduction of at most 5.45% for particular (rare) transactions. But this is something where the core devs have to get involved.\n\n*Edit: I think you, the reader, can disregard solution 3 and all I wrote about it. It is just one FURTHER thought that probably distracts from the main thought. So just consider solutions 1 and 2, and that\'s it.*': 13, "No, it's just a random valid address that nobody knows the private key to.": 2, 'It\'s in the technical level below that.  People think things like "I have 500,000 bits", but that\'s not technically accurate. What you have is a series of payments (inputs) that were authorized by the originator (payer) to be sent to your address.  Those inputs add up to 500,000 bits.  Conceptually this is the same, but technically quite different.\n\nThis becomes evident when you go to spend it.  The wallet gathers enough inputs to cover the amount you are authorizing to be sent to another wallet.  More than likely, there will be some extra amount more than the payment you are making.\n\nLet me break this down a bit, before moving on.  Consider:\n\n**My Hypothetical Wallet**\n\nInputs:\n\n* 1000 satoshis\n* 1000 satoshis\n* 2000 satoshis\n* 3000 satoshis\n\nBalance is 7000 satoshis.\n\nI make a payment for 5500 satoshis. The wallet then takes enough inputs to cover the amount I\'m making a payment for.\n\nLike:\n\n**Wallet Transaction**\n\nInputs for the Transaction:\n\n* 1000 sat\n* 2000 sat\n* 3000 sat\n\nOutputs:\n\n* <person\'s addy I\'m paying> 5500 sat <--- This is my payment\n* <addresss I own> 500 sat <--- This is what people refer to as change\n\nAs you see I had to include enough inputs to cover my payment in the transaction, but there is a leftover amount that gets sent back to an address in my wallet.\n\nWhat I can tell, from a cursory look at what\'s being discussed, Is that at some point the op had 3 satoshi in change from a payment he made.  That created an input into his wallet that is referred to as "dust". to prevent this (as a temp-ish type fix) type of transaction (too small to be valuable) from bloating the block chain.  The devs implemented a filter that stops any transactions with inputs this small from being propagated to the network, which in turn is keeping it from block inclusion.  \n\nHope that helps': 5, "Sorry I couldn't reply earlier, but apparently you managed to it with electrum.

We\'re not discussing "download apps".': 0, 'Instant messages in Gems arrive in two flavors - standard and secret. Standard messages are the default type and provide a standard level of security. Secret messages are meant for highly confidential conversations and provide an extreme level of security and privacy. App users can switch between these two flavors for every chat conversation. Making a conversation secret is very easy, and only requires tapping on the "lock" icon inside the app.\nInstant messages are encrypted on two levels. \n\nThe first level of encryption is relevant for both standard and secret messages. For both types, all communications between the Gems mobile app and the Gems instant messaging cloud server are encrypted - this is also referred to as client-server encryption. Communications between the two is performed over SSL in a secure tunnel (HTTPS) with 256-bit keys. This prevents third-parties from listening in. This also prevents man-in-the-middle attacks and makes sure the Gems app only communicates with the real server and not anyone impersonating it.\n\nThe second level of encryption is only relevant for secret messages. On top of the client-server encryption, secret messages also have client-client encryption. Every Gems app generates a unique random pair of 4096-bit public/private keys upon installation. The public key is propagated within the network, but the private key never leaves the device. The public/private pair is unique to a device. If the user transfers his Gems account to a new device, a new pair is created. The key pair is also expired and refreshed periodically to enhance security.\nWhen user A sends a secret message to user B, it\'s encrypted using RSA 4096 with user B\'s public key. Once the message arrives to user B\'s device, it\'s decrypted with B\'s private key. Decryption can only take place on user B\'s device because only this device has access to the correct private key.\n\nThe benefit of client-client encryption is that it provides a zero trust environment. The encrypted message cannot even be decrypted by the Gems server infrastructure. This means that even if the Gems servers have been compromised and hacked into, secret messages are still 100% private and can only be decrypted by their rightful recipient.\n\nThe drawback of secret messages is that they cannot appear in push notifications. Since push notifications are encrypted by Apple\'s/Google\'s infrastructure, they don\'t conform to zero trust policy. When a secret message is sent from user A to user B, the push notification user B receives contains the text "You\'ve received a secret message from A" instead of showing the actual content of the message.': 1, "That's where open source comes in, then nobody has to trust the developers, e.g. I'm a big fan of TextSecure": 2, '> iOS beta App will be available November 30th and Android will be released at a later stage.

It has a low time-investment to understand, Safaricom offers loan facilities, and it's widely used as money, so no need to transact constantly between it and the native currency. \n\nInterestingly most Bitcoin advocates and enthusiasts make this mistake.

This third party is a bank, not some dumb fuck like you picking up a crayon and writing "bitcoin" on a piece of paper. You know what the difference between you and such a bank is? A bank with a good reputation, which proves its reserves regularly, which gets audited, which contractually promises to abstain from fractional reserve banking and which can and will get sued if they do not fulfill that contract, is trustworthy. You are not, because apparently you are not even able to read one simple English sentence.\n\nI don\'t know why you feel you "found something here". Like what? The idea that there will be a market for banks in the future? Guess what, changetip.com is a bank. They issue digital bitcoin IOUs. No problem there.\n\nAlso, bank notes *is not* the same as fiat currency.

That's not what we're talking about.\n\nPeople don't go around making sure every fiat bill they receive is genuine; why would they need to do so with a bitcoin-backed bill?\n\nA well-established standard for the manufacture of such bills would be enough for the vast majority of commerce in a particular locality, as with fiat; indeed, the U.S. dollar, for example, used to be a promissory note that could be exchanged for the asset that backed it: Gold. Did people go check the Treasury every damn time they received a bill? Do you mark every bill you receive with fraud-detection pen, or do you examine them closely for the special security features? No.\n\nNow, such a note could be exchanged for digital bitcoin even without having to go to a centralized treasury: You just destroy the bill to access the private key and feed it into a computer.\n\nIndeed, you don't even need Internet for validation, just a computing system that has a sufficiently up-to-date blockchain on it. Maybe a local business provides this service for you.\n\nWhat with wirelessly powered, wirelessly communicating, thin devices embedded in such a bill, you could even make cryptographic verifications in bulk without destroying the bills.\n\nYour trouble is that you don't know how things work or what technologies exist.": 0, "You can do that on your own.

There are plenty of other issues with it, but lack of access to infrastructure isn't really a big one. \n\nA LOT more people in developing countries have cell phones than credit cards; purely looking at it on an access basis it would be possible for Bitcoin to overtake credit cards as a payment method.

Maybe prepaid shopping cards will be a thing, where you load some bits onto, you get a discount and you can pay instantly. Or every item has its own address and you pay while you are going around in super market, which confirms the first items which may be strategically placed by the super market to be the rather expensive ones.

What we\'ve ended up with is neither because after literally decades of sunk time and billions upon billions of dollars, they still haven\'t managed to get fusion going, and as a result Thorium has sat on the shelf, sure they\'ve made progress in fusion, but still no product, and it\'s certain it will be decades more before even something approaching a working fusion power plant will enter the market (and even then that\'s still uncertain), yet Thorium was working in the 50s and we could all have saved our planet from disaster (a dream now) and the world could have been rolling in near free energy.\n\nEthereum is to Bitcoin, what Fusion is to Thorium based tech. Bitcoin can serve the world far better than Ethereum ever will IMO, and it can do it right now, yet some people want to stay at the drawing board making a "better" crypto-whatever, while the world goes to hell in a handbasket. People need something that works, and they need it now, and they want guarantees, not vague hopes. People need to stop trying to invent/perfect technologies that we are clearly not capable of doing properly right now. People pushing Etherium really aren\'t helping anyone at the moment and all their lofty aspirations will also be what makes Etherium a non-starter, it will hang itself with all of it\'s promises (in any project you should always under promise and over deliver, Ethereum have done the exact opposite and in many cases this is a death knell to any project).\n\nLuckily most people see the Etherium hype for what it is though.

Oh, wait, it\'s not what happened.\n\nInitially, the protesters led by Gubarev attacked the Donetsk oblast council, i.e. the local government which was elected by inhabitants of Donetsk oblast in 2010.\n\nHow does that make sense? Donetsk people were so much against anti-government protests, until out-of-blue they organized such a protest themselves.\n\nSounds kinda fishy, eh?\n\nIf you look at the facts, it\'s obvious that these protests were organized by Russia. Gubarev was literally a nobody, he was running some tiny ad agency and was not involved into politics.

And his arguments are quite good. You should read his own texts for a decent description of the arguments, but the tl;dr is basically two points:\n\n * Kings are "long-term parasites", while democratic leaders are "short-term" ones. Kings see the kingdom as their property, and will avoid to damage it too much, so that it can keep benefiting him and his heirs forever. Democratic leaders have only their terms to extract everything they can, and that tends to make them much more destructive.\n * In democracy this illusion that "we are the government", that anybody can be there etc makes the subjects much more prone to accept abuses. While in monarchy the distinction between the host and the parasite is much clearer to everyone. People tend to tolerate abuse less.\n\nI\'m not sure whether I agree with that, since we have counter-examples in our world: Saudi Arabia and North Korea (which technically has been an absolutist monarchy for three generations). OTOH, there are prosperous monarchy-like places, like the Emirates, Qatar, Bahrain (the religious authoritarianism that exist in these places is IMHO unrelated to the government system).

So they have an incentive to subsidize the gift card transaction. This is why you see some restaurant cards at Costco selling for a discount.\n\nSecond, the economics of gift cards rely on breakage. That it people giving the company cash for the gift card, and then never using the gift card. This can be forgetting where you put it or in some cases the card expiring.\n\nIn the case of Bitcoin, neither of these situations is exist. A merchant doesn\'t control where the BTC are spent, so they may not get the business. So they have no incentive to spend marketing dollars on that kind of exchange. Also, the merchant does not get the proceeds of the BTC value (unless they themselves sold you the BTC, but then they face serious volatility risk, still without controlling how the recipient spend the currency).\n\nIf you are thinking that a merchant can restrict the use of the BTC to just their stores, then that no longer is a bitcoin system, and it would not have any attractiveness to participate in.\n\nGranted, the recipient could still lose their private key and create breakage. But since the BTC are not tied to a specific use, people will be less likely to lose them (compared to a gift card that requires you to spend at "Olive Garden" restaurant.\n\nI think the simplest way to do this is to give a gift of a paper wallet, or better yet, send your friend some BTC to their smartphone wallet.': 2, 'When you redeem the card it asks you to make a Coinbase/Circle account.': 2, 'Would the gift cards be denominated in Bitcoin?

(Afaik)\n\nIn BTC-card, you would be purchasing a claim to actual bitcoins, deliverable whenever you input a scratch-off code online. This transaction might plausibly fall under "transfer of money" since the BTC would be dispersed directly to the customer.\n\n[Another note: Distribution & production costs are probably very high, so it wouldn\'t surprise me if only a handful of companies supply all those gift cards you see in the store.

Every single person involved in bitcoin in any way, even if they're the operator of the darknet market of the day, is bragging about their involvement with bitcoin openly online, every chance they get. Look at the SR2 guy, bragging about being paid in BTC and buying teslas. Look at Ross Ulbricht, posting his personal bitcoin addresses on bitcointalk. Them and every other idiot in the bitcoin world are just laying it all out there. \n\nFBI loves infiltrating so they can provoke crimes and massage their stats. It's a proven technique when you're dealing with people who aren't bad dudes. Bitcoiners just do it all out in the open. All the FBI needs to do is sit down at a computer for a few days.

Here is our response which was posted in that thread:\n\nDue to the very large, rapid price movements on 11/13 and 11/14 and many users trading with 20x leverage, many forced liquidations were unable to be executed at the target price, thus resulting in a situation where cumulative users' losses exceeded cumulative users' profits by 46.1% for the weekly bitcoin futures contract. As stated in the BitVC Futures rules (https://www.bitvc.com/help/detail?id=81), the systemic losses were allocated to the profitable users proportionally. We understand that this level of loss allocation is unacceptable and so we are crediting the full amount of losses allocated to users' future trading fees.\n\nHowever this was absolutely not a bitcoin heist or a bitcoin loss as alleged by the OP. The cumulative amount of bitcoins held on BitVC futures accounts was not effected by this event. What essentially happened was a major accounting imbalance due to the failure to execute forced liquidations at the target price. The difference between the forced liquidation target price and actual forced liquidation price is what accounts for the 46.1% profits that were withdrawn. In other words, if all forced liquidations had been executed at the target price, cumulative users' profits would have been 46.1% less. This is not to say that we regard this event as normal or acceptable, however this is what we have determined to be the least bad option for dealing with this kind of situation. It is the same policy as the other bitcoin futures exchanges.
