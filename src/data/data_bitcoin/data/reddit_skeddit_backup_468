All economic transactions are positive sum at the time they were executed, *from the point of view of each party at the time*. However, in investment the market value of something you sold to someone may go up or may go down, afterward, so that later on you are glad you made the trade and the other person regrets it, or vice versa. ': 3, "\nTo the extent that Bitcoin is purely a commodity store of value akin to Gold, then it is purely a zero sum game, and in order for anyone to make money in Bitcoin as holder, it has to go up, because someone is selling another asset to buy bitcoins at higher prices.  Like all commodities you get Highs and Lows. Buying Gold in the 70's and 80's was a disaster, Buying Gold in 2000 has been a great move.\n\n\nNow to the extent Bitcoin introduces an entirely new financial model and unlocks new ways to build businesses, to transact, to onboard people who previously had no access to 1st world finances, then Bitcoin is building a whole new financial world that previously did not exist.

The market price levels? Remember, a market is a price that represents participants\' perceived value of an asset. Perceptions of value can "sustain" for a very long time. Money flows from one market to another. So when you make money in a particular market, it may be that someone else lost money in another market, when funds were extracted from that market and directed into yours. The reverse is also true. A price on a market can be sustained, even with no trade taking place, as long as no one feels the price is too high or low and/or is motivated to liquidate.\n\nedit: My use of the word "market" is in the investment sense on the exchanges, not the broader macro sense.': 3, "this isn't an absolute, as in it is not always true and it is not always false\n\nit is part of the economy as a pie fallacy": 2, 'As long as the currency continues to be regarded as a store of value by enough people, it doesn\'t crash and nobody trading it is *necessarily* losing money. Example:\n\nSuppose "A" buys 2 bitcoins for $100 each, and these are the only 2 bitcoin which exist.\n\nThen A sells 1 bitcoin for $150 to B.\n\nThe "market price" of bitcoin is now $150.\n\nA holds 1 BTC, and B holds 1 BTC. They each have $150 worth of Bitcoin.\n\nA\'s total net worth is now $300, because he has 1 BTC worth $150, plus the $150 in fiat he received from B. \n\nB\'s total net worth is $150 for the 1 BTC that he has.\n\nThat\'s $450 total net worth from $350 that went in. How is possible?\n\nA "made money", but not at the expense of B. He made money because the commodity is now valued at a higher price. \n\nSo who "lost money" in favor of A?  Obviously it\'s not the Bitcoin traders in this example. Actually, it\'s another party: the aggregate holders of USD, who didn\'t notice the tiny devaluation of their notes which occurred because somebody decided not to hold them, in favor of BTC.\n\n**TLDR the losers are the ones holding USD.** That\'s what ultimately crashes if everyone were to switch to Bitcoin.': 1, 'Well, yes. But this is true of every new technology before it is widely adopted. First we need to get it to work, then we need to get it adopted for some significant use case - then, and only then, will it have a significant impact on the real economy.\n\nThe current "negative contribution" is actually in a very real sense not consumption, but an investment (as seen from a collective perspective) - both in security, but significantly also as a means of fairly distributing the new coins. Note that this last problem is nontrivial in itself, and probably borderline impossible without "wasting" value close to the current market value of the coins.': 2, "Sounds perfectly sustainable to me, all commodity markets work the same way Bitcoin markets work\n\nBitcoin is just a token it's not creating anything, people are just trading them back and forth it's not much more complicated than that": 1, "When two parties make a trade voluntarily, they do it because they *both* believe they are better off because of the trade. If the trade involves money, then typically one party will have less money after the trade, and the other will have more, but that doesn't mean there's a winner and a loser. Both parties are winners. If this weren't true, then one of the parties wouldn't agree to the trade. (However, when government forces the trade to occur, typically under threats of violence, such as in the case of Obamacare, then there can be a losing party.)": 3, 'This is true in the broader sense of absolute wealth creation incentivized by way of markets.  I believe OP refers to the sustainability (of price levels) of individual markets such as those in finance?': 1, '> But this is true of every new technology before it is widely adopted. F\n\nExcept that the initial stages of a new technology are financed by investors who get equity on the comany, and therefore will share its profits once it becomes profitable.  Wheras today\'s bitcoin investors give the money to the miners but do not get mining equity in return, and will not receive anything for future use of the the bitcoins as currency.  Not even the current miners who make bitcoin succeed will profit from its use, because, by the time that transaction fees replace block rewads, their equipment will be obsolete and other miners will rbably take their place.  The only way the investors can get any return is by finding someone willing to buy their coins for an even higher price.  Obviously this is not going to continue forever; and when people realize that the price is not going to increase any more, they all will sell as quickly as possible, the price will crash, and the network will stop working...\n\n> also as a means of fairly distributing the new coins. Note that this last problem is nontrivial in itself\n\nIndeed it is not a non-trivial problem, and the bitcoin protocol did not solve it.  Giving all the coins to the miners who create them might have been a reasonable workaround if all clients were miners, competing in equal terms.  Once mining became industrialized and out of the reach of most users, that "solution" became a terible flaw.': 1, '> I know that is mirrored in all stocks and finance and so on, but I\'m curious your thoughts.\n\nNot true.\n\nIf you buy a stock, you are buying a share of ownership of the company, and become a residual claimant of its profits. The price of the stock moves up and down, but your ownership interest in the business venture and the potential for a stream of dividends means that it isn\'t the case that "if you are making money, someone else is losing money." Bonds are generally the same, as they pay a fixed coupon/interest over the term of the instrument. \n\nWith commodities and currencies, on the other hand, the only way to make money is buy buying low and selling high, which is in fact a zero-sum game. \n\nThat doesn\'t mean commodities and currencies are unsustainable as investments, but it does mean greater care needs to be taken when deciding to invest. Without profit potential or cash flows, they are very different from stocks and bonds when evaluating them as financial assets. \n\nWarren Buffet frequently discusses this as his reason for not investing in gold. That doesn\'t make it correct or an absolute rule, but it\'s an interesting perspective. \n\n': 1, 'This is the best answer.  Value is created from resources ': 3, "It is valid in a purely mathematical sense but humans are not strictly mathematical creatures.\n\nThink: would you pay $10 for something that that you valued less than $10?  Generally speaking, no of course not!  When you trade that $10, you trade it for something that *you value more than the $10.*  You used to have $10, now you have something more valuable (to you) than the $10.  Your net worth has increased.\n\nBy the same token, the merchant values your $10 more than what you bought.  Before, s/he had stuff that wasn't quite that valuable to them, and now they have $10.  Their net worth (to them) has increased.\n\nThere is still only $10 in the game, but both parties to the transaction have increased their net (perceived) worth.  This is the engine that drives capitalism: the positive sum to both sides of every transaction.\n\nKey point: capitalism is not a zero-sum game.  Money is only a tool, and only part of the equation.  You have to factor in what was traded, and you also have to factor in human emotions.": 1, "However, at current e-payment volumes, the actual positive contribution of bitcoin to the economy is very small (basically, the fees that people save by using it instead of banks, credit cards, paypal, etc.) and *much* less than its negative contribution (more than 500'000 USD of electricity consumed per day).": 2, 'Lets say there were only two people in the world, "Mr.A" and "Mr.B", and there was only $100 dollars in this world, and "Mr.A" had the $100 to begin with.

The $100 dollars, and the house which is worth $100. This continues as "Mr.A" now goes out and builds a house for "Mr.B" and receives the same $100 dollars as payment. There is now $300 dollars of value in the system.

Sometimes those characteristics are useful (some sacred cows need burning), often they aren't (though I'm expect he'd disagree), but regardless you take the good with the bad, everyone has their short-comings; and everyone has the potential for growth and improvement. It's almost always possible to simultaneously increase cooperation and effectiveness at your goals, even when your goals are largely oppositional; but it takes work and difficult to develop skills.\n\nThere are a great many, uh, simply terrible or sick people who are interested in Bitcoin-- a side effect of having a big tent that is interesting to all types.

Under the DMCA, Internet providers gain a safe harbor from civil copyright infringement suits in the United States if they meet certain criteria.  As an initial matter, the safe harbor applies only to civil copyright infringement suits, and does not apply to criminal prosecutions for such offenses.  **In any event, the safe harbor requires that an eligible provider have an agent designated with the U.S. Copyright Office to receive infringement notices, which the Mega Conspiracy failed to do until October 15, 2009, years after Megaupload.com and many of its associated sites had been operating and the DMCA had gone into effect.  Furthermore, the members of the Mega Conspiracy do not meet these criteria because they are willfully infringing copyrights themselves on these systems; they have actual knowledge that the materials on their systems are infringing (or alternatively they are aware of facts or circumstances that would make infringing activity apparent, such as \xe2\x80\x9cred flags\xe2\x80\x9d indicating blatant copyright infringement);** they receive a financial benefit directly attributable to the copyright-infringing activity, which is under their control; **they failed to terminate repeat infringers; and they have not removed, or disabled access to, known copyright-infringing material from servers they control**.  \n\n>21.At all times relevant to the charges presented in the Superseding Indictment, the defendants and other members of the Mega Conspiracy knew that they did not have license, permission, authorization, or other authority from owners of hundreds of thousands of copyrighted works to reproduce and distribute those works, including making them available over the Internet.  Members of the Mega Conspiracy are aware of the way that their websites are actually used by others; **have themselves used the systems to upload, as well as reproduce and distribute, infringing copies of copyrighted content**; and are aware that they have financially benefitted [sic] directly from the infringement of copyrighted works that they are in a position to control.\n\nAre you claiming that similar things can be said about Dropbox?

If it\xe2\x80\x99s so expensive and complicated for each bank to run its own system that contains its own narrow view of the world \xe2\x80\x93 and then have to check it matches the other systems where the facts overlap \xe2\x80\x93 why not just pay somebody to run a single ledger that everybody agrees will be authoritative?\n\nAfter all, as we showed above, any bank that wanted to could easily derive its own view of the world from this mega-table, completely trivially.\n\nOf course, we\xe2\x80\x99d have to give thought to how to mediate access to the ledger \xe2\x80\x93 who is allowed to observe or update which records \xe2\x80\x93 but we know how to do that \xe2\x80\xa6 and it\xe2\x80\x99s not an impossible problem.\n\n*Are you mad?*\n\nNow, it is tempting to say that such a thing would be insane: imagine how powerful would be the firm who ran such a system. And imagine the catastrophic implications for the world if there was a system outage!\n\nPerhaps the expensive, error-prone, but fundamentally decentralised and robust (anti-fragile?) system we have today is a price worth paying.\n\nBut an interesting question arises: what if there a way to achieve the benefits of a globally shared system but without having to grapple with the difficult political question of how to control an all-powerful operator or how to deal with the risk of an outage of such an important, central piece of infrastructure?\n\nPerhaps we can achieve this\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n**The replicated, shared ledger**\n\nRemember what we achieved in the diagram above: we created a single table that could describe all bank balances and which was inherently shared: different actors had different permissions to update different parts of it.\n\nBut the worry in the section above was that a shared global ledger would be controlled by a single powerful entity and that this centralized system could be a systemic risk. So can we make two tweaks to the model?\n\nFirst, why not replicate the ledger massively. So, rather than one copy, have lots of copies. Perhaps one copy at every bank. So now there isn\xe2\x80\x99t a single point of failure. We would have to worry about how those copies are kept in sync, of course, so this isn\xe2\x80\x99t an unambiguous \'win\' but having copies at each bank might also make integration with existing infrastructure somewhat easier, too. Perhaps this would also help ease adoption.\n\nSecondly, why not have those who participate in the system \xe2\x80\x93 maybe just the banks or maybe their customers too \xe2\x80\x93 also be jointly responsible for maintaining and securing it. We know who everybody else is in this world, after all, so we know whom to punish if they cheat. So we replace a single powerful entity with a model where everybody contributes to the system\xe2\x80\x99s security. \n\nIf a single copy of the global, shared ledger is undesirable or risky, then replicating it to all the participants could give the best of both worlds. Now the problem becomes one of automatically keeping the systems in sync rather than manually reconciling and dealing with breaks.\n\nThe picture above looks superficially like the one I drew at the start of the article. But there\xe2\x80\x99s a critically important difference. In this model, all participants have a copy of the ledger but only have the right to amend entries pertinent to them. So it is both replicated and shared.\n\nAnd so this is why I call this concept the \'replicated, shared ledger\'. I think this wording is better at evoking the right mental model than \'distributed ledger\', for example.\n\nAnd depending on whether you want to model balances, other assets or even agreements between parties, there are startups working on a project.
