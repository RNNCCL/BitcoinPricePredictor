Money is not meant to be a commodity, it's a form of exchange. Since money has fluidity it can quickly turn from a herd of goats to a luxury sedan.\n\nWhat we're seeing right now with BTC is it's completely a commodity. That has a lot to do with minimal merchant adoption, but it also has to do with the strategy of holding it and attempting to make money off it just being money. Money as a commodity is bad.\n\nA gold or any other physical linked currency just isn't a reality anymore. Money is too fluid (it's a good thing) nowadays compared to the 1800s and earlier when the value of a dollar was completely meaningless and that being able to exchange for gold (a more universal 'currency') was well represented. We don't need that anymore, USD or EURO is accepted and transferable just about anywhere.  It is gold, it's value derived from the stability of the nation that produces it.\n\nAnd what does Bitcoin's value derive from? Speculation and only speculation. It's value is still $350 because people have invested real fiat into it so has a flaky consistent value.\n\nThat's why it can go to auction and be purchased for much less than it's worth and you couldn't do the same thing with USD or the Euro.": 1, "> Rubbish - use Thunderbird with Enigmail to get GPG to work easily and transparently with email.\n> \n\nNot on iOS or Android, or if you want to do things other than e-mail with it, or if you prefer using a web client, or...\n\nIn my experience the problem with things started by people who like to 'create new things and solve problems' is that as soon as they have to deal with the 'boring' stuff like writing documentation, creating a good UI, or whatever, they go off and write other things.

People who work and save SHOULD like the Austrian approach, but sadly most never understand this. Instead they believe the never ending torrent of propaganda in the media about 'needing' 2% inflation.\n\nThat is flatly wrong - what is desirable is to balance the money supply against the currency needs of the population. If population goes up and productivity is stable, you need a matching increase in money supply to ensure zero price inflation. Similarly, if population decreases with stable productivity, you need a decrease in money supply to ensure zero price inflation.\n\nThat sort of thing with lots of other variables besides productivity and population, means we are assuming that the central banks are utter geniuses are calculating the right level of money supply (and they have inaccurate data to work from), and that they operate outside political pressures.   Yeah right .... never going to work. \n\nSo Bitcoin offers an approach to an honest predictable Austrian style monetary system like gold, but with the globe spanning payment ability that the Kensian fiat systems have developed into. Plus an improvement over gold in prevention of counterfeiting, and possibilities of storage approaches that are invisible and immune to theft via coercion.\n\nSome of the world will choose to use this version of money. The real question is how many people?\n\nThat will control the exchange rate into other fiat currencies and real world goods and services.\nIE.

(The "main" chain is whichever chain of blocks has the greatest sum of target difficulties.) Since it is possible for a block chain to branch, it is prudent to wait until a sufficient number of blocks have been chained onto the block that contains the transaction in question, such that the likelihood of another branch (one that does not contain the transaction in question) becoming the main chain is sufficiently negligible.\n\nIn reality, six confirmations is overkill.

Sending and receiving transactions is instant. *Settlement* takes longer and you choose how many confirmations you are comfortable with before you accept that the transaction isn't going to be reverted or double spent. You could spend an unconfirmed transaction, no problem. The risk in doing so is that your input transaction could be double spent, rendering your transaction invalid, which is why you wait for *settlement* so you are reasonably certain that that won't happen.\n\nNow if you look at the traditional financial services around today, settlement of a transaction can take days to weeks, even months. I'd say 1 hour is pretty damn fast. As for sending a regular transaction and verifying that it's not going to be double spent to a reasonable degree takes a few seconds and requires that you are fairly well connected to the bitcoin network. Propagation through the bitcoin network doesn't take very long and that's exactly what BitPay relies on.\n\n> Which merchants will accept Bitcoin payments in less than six confirmations. \n\nPretty much all merchants that process through BitPay or Coinbase. And even then, for regular goods that are shipped to you, you really don't care that it takes an hour to fully confirm the transaction. Let the customer know that you received the transaction as soon as you get it and then when it's time to ship the product out you can verify if it wasn't double spent. \n\n> I am tired of waiting... and waiting... to send Bitcoin between exchanges.\n\nHave you ever tried sending fiat to one of those exchanges? Did your money get there in less then an hour? No? Thought so.\n\n": 1, "Hi Ninj,\n\nThanks... for the comment...\n\nBut in drilling down, I do not see technically how the computational problem of ten (10) * N minutes, where N = 6, can be improved on.\n\nThe problem is two fold:\n1: there needs to be sufficient CPU in the mining contingent to solve the cryptographic problem \n\n2: changing the Bitcoin protocol will require agreement amongst the miner's securing the BlockChain. Possibly difficult.\n\nWhat I am really pushing in this discussion is for someone to correct me, or two, come to the realization that Bitcoin v1.0 is seriously flawed... and therein force the Bitcoin Foundation to deal with this question.\n\nIt surprises that Bitcoin talks always state 'fast' transaction times (Western Union can send money faster than Bitcoin fifteen minutes globally), when the Bitcoin speakers know that there are at least three (3) serious alt coin contenders where the transaction time is near zero. \n\nOk, I will give up the debate.\n:-(": 0, "No, this is just wrong.
