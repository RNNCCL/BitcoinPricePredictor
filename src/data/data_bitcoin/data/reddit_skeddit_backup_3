It doesn\'t mean it has to move astronomically, but if all else holds equal, the price will have to rise somewhat by December 2016.\n\nWhat I expect to happen is that large Mining operations have been holding on to coins for a few months. They are holding a greater percentage of their coins as they approach the halving so that by the halving they are already operating on 50% revenue. Then they\'ll begin selling off their stashed coins into the halving hype.\n\nSo the price I expect to continue to rise until and maybe shortly after the halving, at which point I expect a significant correction as miners sell off all those coins. Finally after this activity has calmed down the effect of reduced newly available supply will finally be felt ~6months post halving. Obviously this is pure speculation !RemindMe 6months': 1, 'This makes complete sense.  A car is not only a depreciating asset but it requires money for insurance, registration fees, and maintenance.

Well, I think I will generalize it to two scenarios.\n\n1) You get new information, and based on that information you get a compelling need to sell your bitcoins.  Let me just tell you about our example ... we moved to another town and needed to buy a house there.  My wife found just the perfect spot - perfectly fitting our wishes and needs.  It was big, but we could have rented out 50%, and we even knew the perfect tenants.  And it was cheap, compared to the size.  Unfortunately we couldn\'t afford it - the other interessted party had just a tiny little bit more funding than we had.  Yes, I\'d gladly sold all my hodlings for that house.  Another example: your choice is probably based on your love for bitcoins.  Now, what if your feelings for the bitcoins will change at some point?\n\n2) When I write "you will regret", that includes retro perspective.  Maybe Bitcoin will be as dead as MySpace in some few years, maybe the value will plummet.  In retro perspective you will probably regret that you locked the coins instead of selling them.  Then again, you would have needed to be smarter than the market to be able to sell out at the right time, so it\'s not really something to feel bad about.\n\nI don\'t know your situation ... this is indeed a very good way to protect the coins against robbery, coercion, blacmail and a momentary lapse of reason, so it may make sense ... but four years is a long time, and a lot of things may happen before that.': 0, 'Indeed ': 4, 'Weird, here it is again: https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3yoa47/you_can_now_create_op_hodl_address_to_lock_your/': 1, 'Yeah it sure will, you should place a big short and screenshot it :)': 2, "The supply is only 25 per 10 minutes if literally nobody who owns bitcoin sells any.

The rules for doing this are not very complicated, but the system overall can be very hard to follow; so much so that I ended up writing a protocol simulator to be sure it works.\n\nEach node keeps track of two commitment transactions; its local one (which it will drop to the blockchain if anything goes wrong), and the remote one (which it might see on the blockchain if the otherside releases it). For both the local and remote commitments, it keeps track of two types of changes: unacknowledged changes, and acknowledged changes.\n\nNode A pushes a batch of updates to the remote commitment, such as \xe2\x80\x9coffer this new HTLC\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9cI redeem your existing HTLC\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cyour existing HTLC failed to route\xe2\x80\x9d.

Node B checks the signature, and returns the revocation preimage for its previous commitment transaction, promising never to use it.\n\nSo node B has a signed commitment transaction with the changes, but node A hasn\xe2\x80\x99t. We could have node B send exactly the same updates back to A, followed by a commit, but the revocation message serves the same purpose: A knows that B has seen all those updates, so it can now queue those changes to its own commitment transaction. But it still needs B\xe2\x80\x99s signature.\n\nSo B now sends its own update message, signing A\xe2\x80\x99s commitment transaction with those changes applied. A checks the signature, and sends its previous revocation preimage to obsolete the old commitment transaction. Both sides are in sync.\n\nHere\xe2\x80\x99s an autogenerated diagram of A adding HTLC #1:\nA Full Cycle for a Single HTLC Add\nThe General Case\n\nTo deal with the case where B makes simultaneous proposals, we need to get a little bit more formal. Remember that each node makes proposals for the remote side; these changes only get applied locally once they\xe2\x80\x99re acked.\n\nWhen a node first sends an update, it adds it to its remote unacked list.\n\nWhen a node receives an update, it adds it to its local unacked list. This mirrors the above, so both sides have the same lists (my remote = your local, and vice versa).\n\nWhen a node sends a commitment, it first applies everything in its remote lists: both acked and unacked.\n\nWhen a node receives a commitment, it applies everything in its local lists: both acked and unacked. It then copies its local unacked list (ie. all the changes you sent me) into its remote acked list, and sends the revocation preimate.\n\nWhen a node receives the revocation preimage, it copies its remote unacked list (ie. all the changes it send in step 3) into its local acked list.\n\nThe two lists ensure that every change gets applied first on the recipient node, then on the proposer node. There are various ways for an implementation to optimize this of course.\n\nHere\xe2\x80\x99s a case, where they both offer an HTLC at the same time, then commits fly back and forth until they\xe2\x80\x99re both in sync again:\nFees\n\nFee negotiation is a little weird: I have no real interest in what fees the other node\xe2\x80\x99s commitment pays (within reason), but I need to keep fees on my commitment competitive, in case I need to drop the transaction to the blockchain. So unlike HTLCs, they\xe2\x80\x99re not symmetrical.\n\nWe fit \xe2\x80\x9cfee change\xe2\x80\x9d messages into the same yours-then-mine model by ignoring their fee changes when applying changes to our own commitment transaction (technically, we only apply fee changes from the acknowledged set). So we send a fee change like any other change, send the commit, and then when the other side commits, that\xe2\x80\x99s when we finally adjust our own commit transaction\xe2\x80\x99s fee. Fortunately, fee changes should not be very common:\nFee changes following the same flow as other changes.\nOuch My Brain!\nWait, is that an acked or unacked change!??!\n\nThere have been several wrong turns in this design; it went through several iterations using explicit ack numbers before I was convinced they were unnecessary. My implementation had a bug when commit messages crossed over which was so confusing I had to go back to first principles; it\xe2\x80\x99s also been a source of confusion on the mailing list.\n\nIt\xe2\x80\x99d be easy to blame new baby and lack of sleep, but the truth is that protocols have to be simple enough to implement badly: they will be anyway!\n\nImplementing this in my prototype is the final issue for the 0.3 release, which already has a codename thanks to Braydon Fuller\xe2\x80\xa6': 2, "> One more step\n----------\n\n> Please complete the security check to access  \nmedium.com\n\n> \xe2\x98\x90 I'm not a robot\n\nI'm a Tor user.

I wouldn't send him anything until you get that transaction and you get 3 confirmations": 1}, ('ELI5: Lightning Network', 2): {'Here\'s a rough-and-ready explanation. Let me know if you need anything explained differently:\n\nFirst off, suppose you and I regularly send each other BTC. Currently every time we make a payment we have to pay a transaction fee to get the payment onto the blockchain.\n\nInstead we could make a 2-of-2 multisig address using one private key from each of us. Any coins sent to that address cannot be spent unless we both agree by signing a transaction.\n\nSo we both send 1 BTC each to the new 2-of-2 address, I make a transaction (A) saying "pay 1 BTC to dooglus and 1 BTC to llama", I sign it, and send it to you. You sign it, and send it back to me. If you wanted to, you could broadcast it. Then we\'d both get our 1 BTC back. But you don\'t. You hold onto it.\n\nThen when I want to pay you 0.1 BTC I make a new transaction (B) saying "send 0.9 BTC to dooglus and 1.1 to llama", I sign it, and send it to you.\n\nWe keep on like this, sending and signing transactions, but not broadcasting them. It\'s like when you have a tab with a buddy. You\'re just remembering how much you owe each other, cancelling out debts, and not actually exchanging any cash until one of you asks for it.\n\nThis is called a \'payment channel\', and LN is made up of lots of them. If there\'s a channel between P and Q, and between Q and R then P can pay R using Q as a middleman: P -> Q -> R. Both channels adjust the split of the coins between them, but don\'t need to put anything on the blockchain yet.\n\nIt\'s more complicated than that, because we need a way of revoking old transactions. If we start of at 1 BTC each, then I pay you 0.1 BTC (so I have 0.9 and you have 1.1) then you pay me 0.1 BTC (so we\'re back at 1 each), I need for you not to be able to broadcast the old transaction in which you get 1.1 BTC.': 2, 'Looks like you did,  this post went nowhere.

If the second transaction is included in a block before the first one, the first one becomes invalid and can be considered fully cancelled after the second transaction receives 6 confirmations. It's normally not easy to do this. Network nodes won't accept transactions which double-spend coins used in a transaction they already know about. However, nodes gradually forget about transactions if they don't get into blocks, so a transaction could be cancelled if it doesn't make it into a block after several days and both the sender and recipient stop rebroadcasting it.\n\nBitcoin used to have a feature called transaction replacement. A transaction could be marked as non-final, which prevented this transaction from getting into a block, but allowed the transaction to be cancelled at any time.

The longer you can hold on while others are dropping off, the better off you are. With miners dropping off with high electric bill (making the difficulty drop), and the price of bitcoins going up because of less supply, the big mining farms should rake in the profits.\n\nBut what I think will happen, and what will happen, are probably two different things.

Not to mention the cost of all that mining power. Were these huge mining farms around in 2013? If there were, I'm sure they would have been smaller and a lot less of them.\n\nGoing from 50 to 25 bitcoin reward must have been a major blow to miners back in 2013. But I think the profit margin was a little bigger back then. Making it easier to absorb the reduction.\n\nWith profit margins tighter, and these massive mining farms, I think the network is a little more volatile.

Not more than height based locktime, P2SH, CLTV, CSV, etc.  Nodes still provide absolute protection against inflation,  nodes do not verify new signature rules they don\'t know about-- but users opt into making use of those new rules at their own pace and own risk. This is a far cry from "not validating".  They also know they\'re not validating all the same rules miners are, and I suppose if you wanted you could setup your node to shut down in such a case until you updated it.\n\n> I think something like BIP101 combined with optimizations in message transmission achieves a lot of the same scalability issues without near as much fancy\n\nBIP101 achieves absolutely none of the mentioned scalablity benefits. All it does is remove a capacity safety limit without any increase what so ever in the system\'s efficiency at handling transactions. And it takes a similar amount of code to do so (much more if you also assume "optimizations in message transmission"). No amount of message optimizations can provide the actual scalablity improvements I enumerated, but to the extent that such optimizations are possible they can be applied in addition to.\n\n>> It also aids scalability by reducing the free pass on UTXO bloat by shifting costs away from consuming UTXO and more towards creating them.\n\n> How so? Can you elaborate?\n\nTransaction witness data is only needed to verify the transaction, not otherwise-- and it cannot add to the UTXO size. Because segwit discounts it, the net effect is that (once segwit is widely used) costs relatively more transaction fees to create UTXO entries than to consume them compared to today; because the consuming them (which requires providing a witness) is discounted.\n': 4, '> A common argument against a hard fork to a large block size is that it takes up more space.

Script itself introduces at least a dozen modes of malleability, and you also have malleability that comes from the random input of multiple signers in multisig.

There is a lot more to scalablity than "saving space".\n\nLite nodes already save space by only storing their relevant transactions.  However, they still usually store the block headers.  Regardless, the size of transactions for lite clients has never been an issue, and that slight benefit seems to me to not be favorable enough to off-set the introduction of a ton of new code.  That said, the code is being tested thoroughly, and even if it\'s a small benefit, it IS still a benefit.\n\n> It also opens up the potential of new synchronization methods.

More importantly, it\'s outweighed by the fact that segwit turns all non-segwit clients into non-validating nodes.\n\nAgain, I see the benefit and understand your point, I just don\'t think it\'s enough benefit to offset what I view as drawbacks -- the risk of so much new code and the harm to non-upgraded clients.
