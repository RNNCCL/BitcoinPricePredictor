First of all, Bitcoin is PoW. You are talking about PoS.\n\nAnd second, PoS is not cryptographically secure. Ask any serious cryptographer who has studied the subject. No, Nxt pump and dumpers don\'t count as serious cryptographers. Nxt and similar coins are secured by keeping them centralized in various ways, like frequent changes to the protocol that are accepted blindly (Nxt) and checkpoints (Peercoin), which is the opposite we want in a currency.

You don\'t need to perform any significant work to mine, so you can mine all the forks that you want in parallel at virtually no cost. PoS proponents will use all kind of weird arguments that only show that they don\'t fully understand the blockchain. Like when they say "but you need to own a lot of coins, and if you attack us you would be attacking yourself!", which isn\'t true because you can sell them before starting your attack, effectively reducing your risk to zero basically. In PoW you need to own a lot of hardware and have a physical place for it and electricity and cooling if we are talking about mining operations like Bitcoin has nowadays. And you obviously can\'t sell it as soon as you finished your attack (besides you would leave a lot of physical evidence of your fraud), let alone before the attack.\n\nBlackcoin and similar coins keep it secure by playing whack-a-mole with the vulnerabilities or using checkpoints (checkpoints are basically that the dev periodically says "this block can\'t be changed anymore", instead of letting it be consensus based), instead of relying on a solid cryptographic design, which they can never have until someone finds a way to make PoS secure.

This proof can be verified mathematically. It's impossible to fake.

The protocol can have whatever rules it wants. \n\nWhy the hell would you need to deposit cash anywhere? IBM\'s IOT implementation of a block chain has absolutely nothing to do with money. Instead of storing balances their block chain is designed to store the state and status of devices... \n\n**Why not run all nodes.**\n\nWell no shit.

Note that on a single planet, "regional" would not have to refer to a physical region -- it could be any social network; in fact "regional" blockchain membership could be created automatically by looking at transaction history of the parent blockchain.\n\nEssentially we\'d end up creating blockchains both slower and faster then the current one. \n\nIt would be possible to do this with multiple independent "coin" chains but then you\'d have the friction of independent markets that trade these different coins.  Just like we have today with gold -> USD.  This is what "litecoin" is attempting to do.  A "better" solution would be to allow the same bitcoin commodity to transfer into and out of the slower and faster blockchains and have the greater blockchain verify some invariants (such as total quantity) of the lesser blockchain -- but not verify every transaction on it.  An additional advantage is that periodically the leaf (final state) of every account in the lesser blockchain could be "committed" to the greater chain, and then that entire chain (the entire history of transactions within that chain) could be restarted.\n\nIf you are confused, imagine a "tree" of blockchains...\n\nThis architecture relies on the premise the the network has the "scale" property.  That is the premise of localization of payments (i.e. that the majority of payments happen locally); if the average user paid randomly across the entire network (a "scaleless" network), the largest blockchain would see more traffic then the local ones and there would be little point in a fractal design.  I think that bitCoin is "scaleless" as used today, but will become very scaled if mobile payments take off.\n\nA big problem with shoehorning this into the existing system today is the BTC mining award.  There is no way today\'s blockchain could recognize coins "mined" on other blockchains... so the lesser and greater chains would have to rely entirely on transaction fees.\n': 6, 'The same way bitcoin will be when subsidy goes away.

Bitcoin is an international currency so it's not arbitraging *just* the dollar but every currency, dollars just happen to be one of the biggest players.  You kind of have to start by looking at The Fed M1, M2, and M3 numbers. I happen to think it can canibalize all these but some people only count M1. \n\nThese are really economist questions which all hate hard currency anyway so while they could likely provide a good answer they won't because they disagree with the dichotomy to begin with.  \n\nOne thing they can't disagree on is that everything reaches equilibrium so the value is somewhere around the sum of both bitcoin and M1 divided in a certain amount by the two. If bitcoin even takes 1% of M1 then you're looking at an extra 28 billion or so in bitcoins market cap, well over a couple thousand dollars. 1% M2 is a 114 billion added to the market cap. You do the math. \n\nThese are conservative projections. The numbers only get *bigger* the more data you add in. There's hundreds of trillions of dollars in the world. 1 trillion dollar market cap for bitcoin is not out of the question and could be considered quite small. \n\nAh.... but what about the dollar? Well 1% inflation isn't that much is it? But that's if we're being really conservative. *Significant* devaluation only comes with giant value projections on bitcoin, well into tens or even hundreds of trillions of dollars market cap.

There's a little setup work if you haven't set up an Electrum offline wallet, but here's how I did it.\n\n1. Create your new cold wallet with an *offline* machine. \n\n2. Import your paper wallet private keys.\n\n3. Save out the Master Public Key from Electrum. \n\n4. Enter the Master Public Key into your *online* version of Electrum, thereby creating a watch-only wallet.\n\n5. Import your paper wallet *public address*. This part's a little tricky because the UI doesn't import public addresses properly:\n\n    1. Quit Electrum. Make a backup of the wallet file and open it in a text editor.\n   \n    1. Find where it says `'mpk': 'your_master_public_key'}},`\n\n    2. Enter your public addresses *after* that text as follows:\n\n     `'imported_keys': {'1your_public_key_one': '', '1your_public_key_two': '', '1your_public_key_three': ''},`\n\n    3. Note, the empty apostrophes after the colons are where your private keys would go IF you were importing them, but you're not.\n\n6. Open the wallet again with Electrum. You should see your imported addresses and balances.\n\n7. Create a new unsigned transaction. \n\n8. Enter the destination address, then enter '!' in the amount to send the entire amount minus fee. \n\n9. Save the transaction to a file. Move it to the offline computer.\n\n10. Open the unsigned transaction in the *offline* version of Electrum. Sign it and save it.\n\n11. Finally, bring it back to the online machine and use Electrum or Blockchain.info to broadcast it. \n\n12. **Remember that imported private keys are NOT protected by Electrum's 12 word deterministic seed!** You still need to keep your paper backups.\n\nIt seems like a lot when I write it out, but I broke it into as many steps as possible. I like this method because I can combine my Electrum seed's cold storage along with my paper wallets, resulting in a cold wallet containing all private keys for signing transactions, and a watch-only version for monitoring balances, creating and managing transactions, and bookkeeping.

Bitcoin was cool in China because about 50% of ecommerce in places like China and India are paid for using COD, cash-on-delivery, due to a lack of 95%+ penetration rates for (online) banking services and online payment processing. That situation is changing rapidly, btw, but that's why bitcoin was even a thing to consider for Alibaba. Abroad, it's much less interesting, it's just an 'extra' to credit/paypal/stripe/sofort etc.\n\nSo I doubt they'll try to integrate bitcoin for tens of thousands of merchants in the off-chance one of their few non-Chinese users also happens to own bitcoin, at the risk of messing with the government they're so intimately familiar with.": 1, "It's not illegal for businesses to trade with foreign entities in Bitcoin, show me the law that says it is.": 1, "It's there any reason why they can't enable it for non Chinese users?": 1, "PLEASE DON'T DO THIS!!!\n\nI love buying cycling gear, which is really cheap on Alibaba.

Once they accept Bitcoin, I will be financially ruined and I will have more clothes than I know what to do with.

Look at the issues in Hong Kong right now, mostly due to capital issues. (I'll explain if you want).
