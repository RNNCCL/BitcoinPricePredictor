However, in addition to being the longest chain, it also needs to be *valid* in the sense that the transactions that are linked into it are fitting all kinds of criteria (do not create money from nothing, for example), to be accepted by the rest of the Bitcoin network.\n\nBy just looking at just the block headers, you cannot be sure that it also belongs to the longest, valid chain. But doing this verification of all the transactions takes some time.\n\nSo some miners take a shortcut: They start running their mining on just the headers and assume that the network fed them a fully valid block, meaning all transactions in the block are valid, too.\n\nThis *SPV mining*, so far, isn't really a problem. Because if they have a full node in parallel, they can let this full node check the transactions in parallel and, when done, alert the mining hardware that it should work on another block (the one that is actually valid) instead of one that actually has invalid transactions in them. If they spit out one invalid SPV block, that one would be rejected immediately by the rest of the network, because it is also very short (no transactions in it).\n\nNow, BIP66, which changed some details of the protocol to make it overall behave better and more predictable,  was accepted by the majority of the miners (and also full nodes), thus now making it the enforced default on the network. But this also means that old software that isn't aware of BIP66 will create blocks that are invalid according to BIP66 and will be rejected.\n\nAnd a couple of miners did not update. And they produced an old, invalid block.\n\nBut then, miners doing SPV mining started to build on top of this old block. Because they only saw that it is the longest chain, but didn't see whether it is valid.\n\n SPV miner a) created a block on top of the invalid block.  And then, another miner b) went and build on the invalid (but hashpower-wise longest) block once more. And so forth.\n\nAnd this is where it broke down, and could have been done better by the SPV miners. Instead of having a full node that verifies in parallel, and alerts their SPV mining part that the longest chain isn't the longest *valid* chain, they did nothing! They simply didn't run such a full node at all.\n\nMeaning they created a chain fork, a couple of blocks on the Bitcoin chain that were the longest, though invalid and rejected by the rest of the network.

That\'s honestly something that the vast majority of people aren\'t nearly as good at, and you should be proud of that.\n\nWith that said, I do have some critique:\n\n* I think the "buy a portion" analogy with the wine and the small-print table just confuses things unnecessarily. I would simplify that. Ditch the table, and maybe just have a big thing saying "you can buy as little as 0.000001 bitcoin at a time" or similar. Perhaps some kind of analogy would be good, but it should be simpler (no need for a "middle-size" portion to be shown, and no table), and probably something more fluid, and without the confusion of wholesale/retail that a bottle of wine vs. a glass of wine entails - maybe gas from a gas station. "Yes, gas costs $3.50/gallon, but you can buy any portion of a gallon."\n\n* Trim the fat. There\'s a lot here that can wait \'til another time - any discussion of trading/exchanges, mining, etc. And then it may make sense to question if your audience actually has any interest in holding/spending/saving bitcoin, or if they just want to use it to post their ad and be done with it (I suspect this is the case for a large majority). If the latter, it would probably make sense to eliminate all the stuff about savings, paper wallets, and spending bitcoin (although perhaps a VERY brief overview, like the splash of logos of where it can be spent, even indirectly, would be good). And perhaps a Q&A break at some point to find out if the audience does or does not have an interest in holding/saving/spending, at which point brief mention of these things could happen.\n\n* On the subject of that "splash of logos" slide that talks about gift cards apps, the heading is very confusing - it\'s titled "Proxy Apps! (Android only)", but the pictures shown are not proxy apps, and the audience has no idea what a proxy app is (probably - I didn\'t, until I thought about it for a bit). Rather I would head that slide with something like, "spend BTC at all these and more with simple gift card apps!"\n\n* On a more superficial level, I think the theme for the slides is a little weak. The way the whitespace in the heading area is cut off on the top of the screen, out of balance with the closed box for the main content on each slide, just looks "weird" and isn\'t good design. I might experiment with any or all of: closing the top of the heading box to match the bottom of the slide, using a different alignment on the heading text (center or right), using a larger and/or heavier and/or different typeface for the heading text to better fill the heading area and/or distinguish it from the content better, making the divider between heading and content less drastic (a less contrasting color? replace it with a simple underline, perhaps? It\'s a classic for a reason...), and so on. There\'s lots of ways to play with it, but of course I wouldn\'t go nuts trying to get it perfect. As it is now, every slide just looks like a big "H" and it\'s distracting and ineffective, from a design perspective.\n\n* I second the notion already raised about mentioning malware - I think it\'s a very significant threat that deserves some attention. But again, keep things brief however you can. Malware is a good reason to keep bitcoin on a phone (unfortunately).\n\n* You say (or imply) that bitcoin sent by a john to a phone is one-way and cannot be stolen back, but that\'s not really true unless it\'s a watching-only wallet. I would probably clarify that phone wallets use a PIN code just like a bank debit card/ATM, and then MAYBE mention watching-only wallets.

Some local exchanges allow you to use the ACH system, which takes 2-4 business and locks in the price before the funds get there (this has tax implications explained below). Some systems enable instant buys, but the limits on these features are prohibiting for paying a group of employees. Our system hooks into the back of any payroll system, costs nothing for the sending of the funds, enables next day payments and has no limits to the size of the payroll (permitting that it is actually a payroll payment).\n\nOur exchange rate is not always the best, although we are working on lowering it by partnering with a variety of bitcoin exchanges in the United States and around the world to buy the bitcoins. The result of this rate has to do with various costs we receive in order to manage next day payouts without limits. However, when you compare the fees of other exchanges and the cost of sending funds vs our exchange rate and convenience (ease of use, next day and limitless), the total costs of services are lower.': 2, "Paolo from BITWAGE here. Thanks for your question SteveRD1 :)\nIn a nutshell...HOW IT WORKS:\n1.  We give you a bank account number.\n2.  You tell your employer to send your payroll deposit to that number.\n3.  We put bitcoin in your address the next day after deposit.\n\nPlease note that you will only have access to our banking info if you signup successfully and are approved by the Bitwage Team. Also, if you have a payroll provider (i.e. Trinet, ADP etc.) your employer does not have to be involved.\n\nWhen ACH deposits hit our account, we send the funds on the same-day to our partner exchange.

So this problem would not have occurred more than once. SPV clients would be protected and older Core\'s would have effectively stopped processing the chain (or only getting a block very rarely).\n\nIn fairness to Pieter, doing BIP66 as a hard fork would have required manually forcing it via e.g. invalid opcodes in the coinbase, as unfortunately the version field is not a consensus rule so there\'s no built-in way to tell old nodes "stop mining, you are out of date". So the code would have been a bit more complex.\n\nAdditionally, "miners who don\'t validate" isn\'t something we should really be designing for. Miners who don\'t validate transactions are effectively getting paid by us all for work they are not doing, and that\'s a problem no matter how a rollout is designed.\n\nStill the point stands - if BIP66 was a hard fork then SPV wallets and obsolete Cores would be much safer than they are now.

Hard forks are safer in this respect because once the initial split has happened, unupgraded miners are left mining their own little branch that everyone except unupgraded full nodes will ignore because it never catches up with the main one.\n\nAs well as being safer for SPV clients, a hard fork would have been safer for miners that were failing to validate, because they'd also be following the longest chain and ignoring the unupgraded orphan branch.

This is a fact. It's observable through empirical data for as long as we have had those sort of data. Ignoring this is idiotic. No one with a remote understanding of the topic argues against this. Even if they argue against multiple free floating currencies, this is not the approach they use, because it's the equivalent of arguing against gravity by saying the apple falling to the ground is a viewpoint. \n\n>So as a worker I can rationally accept that I might in some situations need to settle for a lower wage to keep my job (unless my skill set is in high demand) or not accept it and get fired or have the business simply quit.\n\nNo, as a worker you rationally do what benefits yourself the most. Which is to resist any wage lowering till the last minute you can to maximize your own income. This isn't even taking into account that there is an unavoidable information lag between the time when the economy shifts to put pressure on wages  and when you realize/experience that shift/pressure.  \n\nWhat you are talking about is whether wages are immovable. No shit they are movable. There is a reason we say sticky wages, not nailed to the wall wages. The point is that this is a prisoner's dilemma. Unless all players collectively act in a way that's the opposite of what personal utility maximization dictates, they all end up worse off. But no one is going to do it by themselves first or even second, because they will benefit themselves by doing it last. \n\nI never stated anything about government controls. This has nothing to do with the issue. The issue is what happens when you force different distinct economies into using the same currency, and thus artificially binding them to each other's health. \n\n>I would also like to point out, how your suggestion (floating government controlled currency) punishes everyone alike, rational or irrational. My suggestion (free market capitalism combined with a world wide trustless ledger) will reward rational actors and punish irrational actors. I for one believe incentives matter. If you subsidize irrational actions, you will see more of them.\n\nAs I've said, when you force different distinct economies into using the same currency, you are artificially binding them to each other's health. This breaks the link between the health of the economy/the actions that economy chose to undertake takes and the actual economic feedback of those decisions. They are now beholden to forces and decisions totally out of their control. For example, the germans are now affected by greece. If greece collapses, the germans will be negatively affected because the euro (which they both use) will be negatively affected. Conversely, Greece (and all the other countries like potrugal, italy, spain, Ireland) gets to limp along because the health of the german (and to a lesser extent the french) economies. The germans have to perform CPR on the deadweights, or they will get dragged down into a economic rescission through no fault of their own, just because they share a currency and that currency will crash. \n\nSaying it rewards rational actors and punishes irrational ones is a joke. You have no clue what you're talking about. ": 1, "> German wage suppression policies coupled with the Euro's strength made German exports more attractive than Greek, guaranteeing a current account deficit which became the debt problem we see today.\n\nAre you blaming germans for being too good and efficient at production?

The Troika could stop being recalcitrant and actually strike a deal. Greece could enter technical default temporarily in hopes of forcing a new agreement.
