This is a situation which can\'t be relied upon.\n* They haven\'t had much to gain from it so far. We\'re *not* using the OP\'s scheme, so when a block is rejected, it\'s rejected absolutely by everyone running a full node, which still seems to be a very significant section of the economy (and will hopefully remain so). Therefore, miners have a significant incentive to not break the rules. If everyone was running an SPV node, then the miner majority *would* have a strong incentive to break the rules to whatever extent allows them to extract as much value as they can from Bitcoin (and I very much doubt this would align with Bitcoin\'s principles or the desires of most Bitcoin users). The OP\'s proposal is similar, though in that case it\'s a *little* more difficult for miners because they have to work around the network issues, and they\'re also limited to messing with just the block size. On a somewhat separate subject, another situation in which miners could get something to gain from becoming a cartel is if they receive government pressure to do so: right now a handful of pool ops, all in the same country, could work together to instantly stop all Bitcoin transactions, or only allow transactions that are somehow "verified", for example.\n* In some (but certainly not all) cases, pools which abuse their position might make less money, especially as time goes on and the subsidy gets replaced by transaction fees. If they abuse their position despite this, mining-hardware-owners may eventually move to different pools. Though hardware ownership has also become fairly centralized.\n* If miners exploit their position to do great evil, the PoW algorithm will be changed. Though that\'d be messy and dangerous, so it\'s very much a last resort (though all-powerful) defense against evil miners.': 1, "This can easily be gamed by any party looking to change the status quo. Furthermore, votes should only be counted from mined blocks, since PoW will prevent Sybil attacks. But then we're just back in the same position of having the majority of the hashing power dictating the block size.  I don't think this is a good way to handle dynamic block sizing.

So what is keeping them from doing what you describe right now?': 1, 'Miners have a separate [relay network](http://bitcoinrelaynetwork.org/) amongst themselves. They don\'t need to depend on the Bitcoin network for relay. They\'ll just create a long chain and eventually it\'ll get pushed through the Bitcoin network *unless* it is hard-rejected. Permanently hard-rejecting blocks is the only tool that nodes really have.\n\nAlso, if a node accepts a block but refuses to relay it, then this doesn\'t make a lot of sense. It\'s saying, "I hope and predict that this block won\'t actually last, but I\'ll accept it as adding confirmations to transactions and work to the longest chain anyway."\n\nAnother problem is that if you have to manually set the limit, then almost everyone is just going to use the defaults. The ones who don\'t use the defaults will be a tiny economic minority. And even if the limits are automatically assigned somehow, if the limits are fairly evenly spread across the number line, then people will tend to fall off the network one-by-one as miners slowly increase their block sizes, and at no point will there be an effective economic resistance against an increase.\n\nOne idea (based on [my old per-node limit idea](http://pastebin.com/9c3bev96) with some additional ideas by aminok) would be for miners to *propose* a specific new max block size, and if a particular proposal gets x% of miner support, then full nodes would automatically show a GUI making each user of a full node choose to accept or reject this proposal. After a "voting period", miners would choose to go forward with the proposal and split permanently from people who said no, or abandon the proposal. Since the "vote" happens at the same time for everyone, it ensures that any economic resistance will be strong. (Note that the point of giving miners a say here is just to attain coordination. In general, miners do not and should not have any particular decision-making power in these sorts of issues.) It is vitally important that the client make a recommendation here using automatically-computed information about the computer\'s technical capabilities, or else we\'d get nearly a 50-50 split every time, which would be an absolute disaster. There would need to be some infrastructure for people (especially businesses) to gauge the economy\'s support here. One good method would be for people to send the constants going into the limit recommendation algorithm every time they buy something with the payment protocol so that businesses can predict which currency their clients will use whenever there is a limit-increase proposal.\n\nWith this idea, even with the mechanisms intended to reduce it, at every increase there would be some split in the economy, which would be pretty awful. And to get it all working properly would require quite a bit of thought and code. So I still think that a global max block size is preferable, though I do think that the above idea *could* be made to work.

But the majority of drop of nodes was also due to miners moving from their own wallets to a shared pool\'s node.\n\nBack then everyone who wanted to mine had to use their wallet to mine from their own home and thus each miner were part of the full node counts. this was before pools blew up. also regulars users had their nodes running due to blockchain being smaller in size. thus it was cheaper in space. i also thing it was the empathy effect which helped as well. it was the beginning and a lot of those nodes came up online form regular users as well to show their support. It would not cost you a lot of space time and these users well willing to eat up the energy consumption. ( these are my assumptions as i was not in the space at those early years)  \n\nOther than that spot on. \n\nI foresee our newest issue here will be the centralization of nodes as users might move to have their "full" nodes on cloud services. While they might think running a full node on some one else server is beneficial, eventually this will cause a concern similar to pool nodes. \n\nIn reality while moving to these "cheaper to run" cloud services, we might risk the effect of having very few big service run most of the nodes and thus putting the our network trust on them to always stay up and running and not to use their power to force malicious code being relayed.\n\nI think it is good that people in the space now are focusing on this and trying to come up with ways to reduce the cost to run your own nodes. we will need as much help and resources on this as we are putting into the mining and payments services. \n\nIt will be cheaper for a harming party to attack bitcoin network via node consensus than via mining. The main reason why i think this will be an oncoming issue in our space. \n\nHopefully more and more resources are put to reduce the cost effect to run individual nodes and with the help of bitcoins price rise the individual nodes will be greater then the centralized nodes offered by the cloud services. ': 1, "I'm not going to pitch an altcoin here, but personally I did like the idea that some alts have implemented where running a node pays around 10% of the block/tx fee reward.  \n\nIt's a small fraction but it's not negligible and can add up over time.  In order to set up a node, you need to hold in reserve some amount of currency units (i.e. 100 BTC) for as long as the node is active, and then when a block is found a random selection algorithm picks one of the eligible nodes to distribute the reward to, independent of the payout to the mining pool. People can obviously set up as many nodes as they want to increase their odds, they just have to reserve currency each time. \n\nThis creates an incentive to hold some of the currency in reserve (which drives up the price) and creates a real financial incentive to create nodes (which increases the health of the network) AND makes it prohibitively expensive for a 3rd party to set up a large number of nodes and attack the network. \n\nIf miners want to complain about losing 10% of the block reward, the mere fact that so many nodes would be holding currency could drive up the price more than 10% and everyone's profit would be higher because of it.": 1, 'me as well. i am not looking to put a quota number under it.\n\nsimple cheering for those trying to scale down the incentives to run an individual nodes. \n\npreferably i would like to see a higher % of individual nodes compared to the centralized nodes (like wallets run on a common cloud service) ': 3, "Seems like you could also include a merke tree with all input's to prove no transactions have been made from a specific address.

In this way the nodes will all be run by whoever can get the most nodes setup the fastest. The reason this doesn\'t occur with mining is because mining is relatively "hard". The costs of spooling up a node are relatively tiny comparatively. \n\nI think this may have the opposite effect.

The 4MB number is a theoretical max size if there are blocks filled completely with the largest possible multisig transactions.  A vast majority of transactions currently are the standard single sig transactions, therefore 1.6MB is more accurate.\n\n\nAlso, there is the issue that they want to implement it as a soft fork by signing all SegWit transactions as "anyone can spend" to maintain backwards compatibility with older clients.  This basically lets non-SegWit clients stay on the network, but in a confused state and without validating the legitimacy of any of the transactions.  Many feel that it would be much cleaner and safer from a security point of view to implement it as a hard fork rather than keep non-verifying nodes on the network.

I don't really care which is done first, and am happy to follow Core's leadership, but they should commit to both. They are not mutually exclusive.\n\nThey are mutually exclusive, right now. We had a series of data-driven open workshops exploring this question, and the clear result was that the network can't currently handle more than about 2MB block sizes at this point in time and retain its adversarial protections.\n\nNow if you look to the Core roadmap you'll see a number of research directions mentioned (e.g. IBLT, weak blocks) which are expected to increase capacity. The plan, put simply, is this: use the existing excess capacity to deploy segwit; concurrently research and deploy IBLT, weak blocks, and various other network layer improvements; measure and verify that these technologies have in fact at least doubled the available capacity; deploy a block size increase fork. It is most likely that around this time next year we should be working out the details of a 2MB hard fork on top of the already deployed segwit code.\n\nIf I were a betting man, that's the outcome I'd put my money on. But the philosophy of Core is conservative, and we do not feel that we should be betting with the entire Bitcoin economy by committing to a 2MB hard fork in addition to segwit and setting dates before we have even developed and tested the technology that would make it safe to do both. The scenario I outlined above is the most probable outcome with what we know today, but there are known unknowns and probably unknown unknowns that could  interfere with such a schedule. We _think_ that the network could support another doubling after mitigating the effects of the Great Firewall. We _think_ that a combination of IBLT and weak blocks will be able to do that, although no concrete proposal exists as yet. We _think_ that deployment of these technologies will be all that is required to achieve the next level of scale. We think. But all of that is untested, and it would be irresponsible and reckless of us to commit to such an outcome before we actually did our homework.\n\n_Right now_, we are only certain that the network could be safely made to support double its present on-chain capacity with either a 2MB hard-fork or segwit deployment. Of these, segwit is the obvious clear winner as it brings other scaling benefits as well. So we can commit to a schedule for that and do our best to meet that deployment schedule. We have also identified the problems that we believe are holding us back from a further doubling, and possible solutions to those problems which require more research. We can commit to doing the proper research in a timely fashion, and hope that deployment of that technology leads to another capacity doubling. But that's an empirical question, and we can't promise the results!": 9, "It seems like with the lightning network, everything is going to have to be published to the chain EVENTUALLY, so i don't understand how it would help.

At best, they offer no value to the network other than being a dumb relay. At worst, they create a weak spot and a possible attack vector. There should be a hard fork that simple invalidates non-segwit aware nodes so they can't pose any risk. What happens if someone makes a bot that connects to hundreds of nodes and tries to spend the anyone can spend transactions?  The segwit aware nodes will probably ban the incoming connections that relayed the invalid transactions, but the old nodes will be none the wiser. Eventually the p2p network will split into two groups of connected peers with little to no interconnection between the two and the older half would be unaware of any problems.  The blockchain might not fork, but the p2p network would be a mess. I feel that hard forking at the start and forcibly removing the non-segwit nodes with a consensus change is healthier for the network.": 1, "You're missing a few points.  \n\n1. Basic scaling is a simple necessity for most technologies and businesses.  If you want a network to be able to handle increasing traffic, you have to upgrade your infrastructure.  For bitcoin, this can be done ad hoc (e.g. hard fork when needed), or we can make the change just once to a dynamic system that automatically calculates a new block size cap every 1000 blocks or something tied to average volume.  Code for this has already been written, it's not that complicated.\n\n2.  The cost of hardware is continuously falling.  The cost of supporting a full node that can handle 1 MB blocks is much lower today than it was 5 years ago.  Same with the cost for supporting 2 MB and 4 MB etc.  So if you simply wanted consistency in cost of running a full node, you'd have to upgrade block size cap every so often.\n\n3. Numerous other changes are in the works that will reduce the cost of running a full node.  SegWit is one example.

The main issues are bandwidth and verification time. Full nodes have to download and verify all Bitcoin transactions as they happen. Also, the network needs to provide enough upload capacity for full nodes to be able to download this stuff. So the minimum requirements for a reasonably-safe increase to the effective max block size (MAX_BLOCK_SIZE plus expected witness data) are:\n\n* ~All existing full nodes should have enough download bandwidth that they can download DOWNLOAD_TIMES\\*effective_max_block_size in about 30 seconds without experiencing much noticeable congestion, where DOWNLOAD_TIMES is the average number of times that full nodes download a given transaction -- currently slightly higher than 2.\n* ~All existing full nodes should have enough CPU power to verify a new worst-case effective-max-size block in about 30 seconds without experiencing much noticeable performance degradation.\n* On average, full nodes should have an upload bandwidth sufficient to upload DOWNLOAD_TIMES\\*effective_max_block_size\\*SPREAD_FACTOR bytes in about 30 seconds without experiencing much noticeable congestion, where SPREAD_FACTOR denotes the average number of times each full node must upload a transaction before everyone who wants it has it. SPREAD_FACTOR depends on how efficiently the network is laid out, how many lightweight nodes there are, and what data lightweight nodes are requesting. It is theoretically as low as 1, but with the current network it's probably unsafe to assume anything less than ~7 (= the number of outbound peers who might not have a newly-received block).\n* The UTXO set must not grow so quickly that it creates space issues.\n* All of the above must be provided in a decentralized way. It's not reasonable to rely entirely on supernodes that big companies might (theoretically) provide.\n\nThe bandwidth issues can be improved in a number of ways, which would, if actually done, allow for larger blocks:\n\n* DOWNOAD_TIMES is ~2 due to the fact that all full nodes actually download each transaction twice: once as a stand-alone transaction and once in a block. This could be significantly reduced with something like IBLT or weak blocks, but it can never reach 1.\n* The requirement to download a block in 30 seconds is because the time it takes a block to flow across the network needs to be insignificant compared to the target block time of 10 minutes, or else the network is likely to fall out of sync for long periods of time. Something like IBLT or weak blocks would spread out most of the download so that a full node can download/upload/verify stuff over 10 minutes instead of 30 seconds. However, there are various problems with IBLT / weak blocks still under investigation -- foremost of which is the fact that evil/incompetent miners can create bad blocks that completely remove the benefits of these solutions.\n* Natural increases in the world's bandwidth.\n* Make the network more efficient to reduce SPREAD_FACTOR.\n* Refuse to serve lightweight nodes to reduce SPREAD_FACTOR, or make them pay for the services provided by full nodes in order to subsidize full nodes' increased bandwidth requirements (note that this would likely only subsidize a part of the total requirements).\n* SegWit allows for future implementation of fraud proofs. With fraud proofs, it might be reasonably safe for full nodes to verify only a percentage of all transactions that are occurring, and rely on fraud proofs from other full nodes to detect problems in the rest.
