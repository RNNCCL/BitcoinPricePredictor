BTW - the first I heard about the leak was Nov 30, when they sent me this email. \n\n\nDear Valued Customer, \n\nOn November 17, we were privately notified of an IP address leak vulnerability affecting the port forwarding feature of our service. Essentially, anyone connecting to a forwarded port on any of our VPN gateways could have their real IP address leaked to an attacker specifically targeting a PIA user. \n\nWithin 12 hours of the initial report, we developed and tested what we thought was a complete fix, and deployed it to all of our VPN gateways. \n\nOn November 26, the researchers who discovered the vulnerability made it public and we quickly noticed that our service was still vulnerable to the IP address leak in certain cases, despite our initial fix. After further investigation, we also realized there was a separate but related issue on our desktop client. To fix this issue we are releasing updated VPN apps to prevent any leaks. We released v.52 on November 27. \n\nProtecting your privacy is our top priority and although exploiting this vulnerability is difficult and requires an attacker to specifically target you, we feel like we let you down with our initial response. Please accept our apologies, we are sorry. \n\nWe highly recommend users update to v.52 (or later) of the client. To ensure all of our beloved users remain protected, we have pushed an update to existing clients. Please update immediately from the application or visit one of the following links: \n\n<redacted>\n\nTechnical Facts: \n\nThe vulnerability relies on the fact that a direct route exists between the VPN client and server. If the client accesses a forwarded port on the VPN server that is maliciously set up by an attacker, the client will use the direct route using the user\'s default route, bypassing the VPN entirely. \n\nOur initial fix was to block VPN clients from accessing forwarded ports on the same server at the VPN gateway firewall level, but we soon discovered a flaw in our desktop clients that made the fix incomplete. When the client disconnected, the direct route to the VPN gateway was not removed, thereby making users vulnerable even after they disconnected from the VPN. Beginning with v.52, we remove these "lingering" direct routes to the VPN gateway at disconnect time. \n\nNote: If you are connecting to our service with a native OpenVPN client, or PIA\'s Android or iOS apps, you do not need a client-side fix.

Very often, the owners of such capital seek to make their subjects dependent on the existence of continued exploitation, perpetuating the continual increase in wealth disparity. Saying "everyone\'s coin is worth more" doesn\'t really address the situation when the keepers of such a wallet are either lost or lose their wallet\'s key, because the flows of capital that were previously established before the loss of such access will leave the system in a previously uncharted state.

In fact, being able to take on debt at a low interest rate is actually valuable to an economy; it provides fluidity and more rapid responses. So debtors and debt are not going away any time soon. The type of debt we're talking about is exploitative debt - think microloans and payday type of operations. The behavior of the lender entity in trying to gouge their customers has no mapping to the currency.

So one someone dies without forwarding them to heirs or loses them through forgetting their keys, it makes everyone else\'s bitcoin more valuable. \n\nIf the bitcoin price is basically a function of supply and demand, and coin loss reduces the available supply, then the price per coin will go up. \n\nThe effect of such events is pretty negligible so far, because bitcoin is still experiencing ~10% inflation, but in the far future when only 1 BTC is mined per year, yes it might matter quite a bit if someone loses several BTC. \n\nThere doesn\'t need to be a replacement or "redistribution" process, because bitcoins can be made infinitely divisible.

It\'s more like an invisible hand moves the value, and so the valuation of a coin will be more erratic.\n\nAlso, no one decides who needs more than anyone else. What I was thinking is that stagnate coin repatriation should be part of the miners work; periodically, all old wallets are reviewed and a small portion is withdrawn from them. Their ledger history in terms of stagnation should allow miners\' machines to see what wallets were sequentially hit by such a stagnation penalty, and so the penalty would increase according to some accumulating scale, like squares or something, and the tax would be redistributed to all other wallet holders no under current stagnation penalty.\n\nImagine if you didn\'t move your coin after 3 years. But then after that, you got hit with something that cost less than a cent. Would you complain? No, it wouldn\'t make sense to because you would just be bitching to everyone else.

It is because the creation of debt (bank\'s IOU) is a monopolized institution, and widely accepted form of money.

From [Pando.com](https://pando.com/2015/02/28/meet-pierre-omidyar-a-handy-primer-for-new-first-look-hires/):\n\n10 Things Every Fearless Adversarial Investigative Reporter Should Know About Pierre Omidyar\n\n    1. Pierre Omidyar, his wife, and his top Omidyar Network director have logged in over a dozen visits to the Obama White House to visit senior officials and members of Obama\xe2\x80\x99s National Security Council.\n\n    2. Between 2011-2013, Omidyar Network co-funded with USAID regime-change groups in Ukraine that organized the 2014 Maidan revolution. In India, the head of Omidyar Network\xe2\x80\x99s operation, Jayant Sinha, concurrently worked for the far-right BJP Party leader Narendra Modi helping him take power in 2014, after which Modi appointed the Omidyar Network partner as his junior finance minister.\n\n    3. Pierre Omidyar is a free-market libertarian loon who told Nobel Prize winner Mohammed Younus he refused to donate to the poor unless he could personally profit off of it. A few years later, hundreds of poor rural Indians committed suicide to avoid debt collectors working for one of Omidyar\'s for-profit microfinance lenders.\n\n    4. Omidyar is the chairman of eBay/PayPal, which boasts of its own private global police force that works \xe2\x80\x9chand in glove with law enforcement agencies," including the DEA, to whom eBay provides user data \xe2\x80\x9con a silver platter\xe2\x80\x9d without subpoenas. Omidyar\'s eBay executives boast of arranging thousands of arrests around the world.\n\n    5. Although Omidyar allegedly does not interfere in his journalists\xe2\x80\x99 editorial, he does control all hiring and firing, budgets, approval of expenses for taxi rides and cocktails, snuffed months worth of investigative stories from leading investigative journalists, forces editorial staff to attend countless meetings, imposes task-management software on editorial, and \xe2\x80\x9cwrites more internal messaging than anyone else.\xe2\x80\x9d But he does not interfere in editorial.\n\n    6. Omidyar believes that journalists should help police arrest sources who leak stolen information from private for-profit companies. Omidyar supported the persecution of the PayPal 14 because he believes that free speech rights should be subordinate to the rights of private enterprise\xe2\x80\x99s mission to maximize profits for shareholders.\n\n    7. Omidyar is a committed prepper whose fear of pandemics and epidemics is so great, he has invested large sums into ensuring his own personal food supply, and has buried several months\xe2\x80\x99 worth of food in storage facilities in properties around the world, from Hawaii to Montana, Nevada, and an island off the coast of France. Omidyar keeps a private French jet, and pays a private security detail made up of former Secret Service and State Department officials to help him survive his apocalyptic fantasies.\n\n    8. In 2007, Omidyar invested in Maui Land & Pineapple, which was subsequently accused of being part of the largest human trafficking operation ever busted by US federal officials.\n\n    9. Omidyar loved Second Life so much he invested in Linden Lab and communicated with its CEO through his Second Life character, \xe2\x80\x9cKitto Mandala,\xe2\x80\x9d a tattooed black man who rode a Segway and wore a T-shirt that read \xe2\x80\x9cKISS ME I\xe2\x80\x99M LAWFUL EVIL.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n    10. Omidyar was investigated by Congress and sued for secretly \xe2\x80\x9cspinning stocks\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 insider trading on IPOs \xe2\x80\x94 with Goldman Sachs. Omidyar was also accused by Craigslist and a Delaware judge of stealing the "secret sauce of Craigslist\'s success\xe2\x80\x9d and passing those secrets to eBay in violation of contracts, fiduciary duties and securities laws.\n\n    Bonus: Pierre Omidyar arranged an interview with two \xe2\x80\x9cfiercely independent\xe2\x80\x9d journalists on Omidyar\xe2\x80\x99s payroll at The Intercept, in which he revealed to them what tea he drinks in the morning.

As we see consolidation of bitcoin ATM business, e.g. more and more operators create networks of bitcoin ATMs, rather than machines run by individuals as was more a trend at the beginning, I assume there is a way to run this business and convert cash into bitcoins.\n\nSo in general your argument is two-point:\n\n- on the decreasing price market (which was happening from the beginning of 2014 till now) operators due to holding liquidity in bitcoins lose value of funds and pass these costs to customers? Also putting the figures into perspective, if in the model above (10 machines) operator must have $20K in bitcoins, so even with two-fold fall of bitcoin price during a year operator loses $10K, which is 10K/3.6Mio = 0.0003%, I mean it looks to be totally not significant. Even if the bitcoin holdings should be $50K or $100K, it is still drop in the size of fees.\n\n- second main argument is that it is hard to convert cash to bitcoin on regular basis, and operators pay 5-7% markup on this. I mean if this is the case, this increases the end fee for customers dramatically to 15-17% leaving 10% as net fee charged by operator, which some charge. But are these 5-7% justified? What kind of market players category charges that much on wholesale market?\n\nYou provide some valid reasoning, but the model of operating is still not clear. My assumption was of running a bitcoin ATM biz via bank, however, you say it is not possible long-term as account will be closed anyway.": 1, "I remember there was a Robocoin machine closed in Australia, because banks terminated relations, although the business was following all legal requirements and rules. Didn't know that exactly same picture is currently in North America.\n\nI remember this FinCEN statement, but basically what you say is that it doesn't work and banks close accounts of MSBs without consider their business model anyway.\n\nSo what we get in the end with the bulk opearators (2nd group) is that end customers basically pay twice the fee, one is the localbitcoins and the other one by operator on top of it. So it is cheaper to get coins by meeting locabitcoiner, however, ATM gives advantage, the question is this advantage really worth that much higher fee?\n\nI do understand the current state better now, however the model of repurchasing bitcoins from localbitcoiners seems very flawed to me, although it is only currently available opportunity as you say. Solutions could be:\n\n- Unbanked bitcoin machine (when via price machine coordinates the demand and so keeps the constant amount of bitcoins and cash available over time). The problem is the demand and supply is limited to geo burdens and price discovery might not be efficient for particular ATMs. I think BTCPoint was working on some kind of unbanked functionality, but I think it ended up with nothing. What do you think about unbanked machine, is it real it could be helpful in this scenario?\n\n- Having some cash eating business in parallel, e.g. Satoshi Citadel in Philippines have several business and for example they have bitcoin remittances, when for example money comes from abroad in the form of bitcoin and you need to cash out to local users. In this case bitcoin ATM business and remittances could co-exist, if the volume is about the same for both. Of course it will work in case it is more about incoming remittances, which is probably not the case for US. However, maybe there are other potential businesses which can eat cash. E.g. issuing payday loans in cash, and then customers will return via transfers. Or checks cash out services. I've seen many bitcoin ATMs are located at cash exchange offices, so it might work like this already.\n\nI mean in general the current state of things is clear and it is understood where from the higher fees are coming, but again this problem looks flawed and should be resolved over time in some form. I also had an impression that getting cash instead of wire transfers was something advantageous to the bulk seller of bitcoins. E.g. if bitcoin ATM operator could find a miner who mines on wholesale level, then actually miner would be glad to sell bitcoins even at lower than market price for cash. At least, this was an argument by some operators, when basically the discussion was about shifting the fees to miner, from whom to purchase at low than market price and then sell bitcoins to customers at 0% (market rate).\n\nI think over time it should get resolved in some form, because for now it seems to be very inefficient.\n\n>In your example you say worst case scenario their float decreases in value by 50% over a year, but this is very inaccurate. They are purchasing a few percentage points above market and then the price drops 5-10% in the matter of a few hours. If they try to sell for 5-10% above the new market price, they are basically keeping their machines on at a complete loss.\n\nDon't agree here, statistically if you do regular purchases (say daily) of similar amounts all short term fluctuations won't matter, only long term will define a loss or profit for operator because of rate volatility. You provided an example when the price goes down for 5-10% quickly, but on opposite it could be the case when price goes up 5-10% quickly after bitcoin purchase. So one day will be exchange rate loss, another day will be additional margin when bitcoins price increased. The problem is only when price rises quickly - many bitcoin operators just stop operations, because it is more advantageous just to hold bitcoin funds, rather than sell and repurchase, because during this lag before repurchase price goes up again.\n\nHowever, if the business is provided on regular basis only long term matters, and I mentioned price two-fold decrease, because this is what happened over 2014-15 (1000->500->250). But looks like there was some bottom touched at 200, hope for optimistic scenario here in the future.\n": 1, "I appreciate the reply bro\n\nThe site is great otherwise and live rates sounds great\n\nbut 20% don't make sense anywhere. especially when theres 8%  plenty of other places in the city": 1, "the machines can ask for a lot of info sometimes too. but it's just the easiest/quickest way to buy bitcoin bro.": 3, 'I recently moved from TX to NY and it looks like LibertyX.com is here as well.

The ATM system doesn't take off because of experiences such as the one you describe here in the OP, are standard. People go to coin ATMs and get ripped off with absurd fees, the machine is oftentimes not functioning and limits and verification demands seem very arbitrary and opaque. If you're really lucky the operator has bothered to report correct data to coinatmradar, maybe a few montsh ago when it was new and shiny, but typically not. And ultimately this is the undoing of the ATM operators, because people can't rely on the ATM network and simply give up going to them. This leads to machines often closing or moving because they are not profitable, which causes people to waste even more time going to machines that aren't even there, or have raised their fees to something even more ridiculous and so on. \n\nFor fiat ATMs, it's not a big deal if they are sometimes out of order, because there is another one just around the corner, but for Bitcoin ATM where you may have to travel considerable distances to get to one, it's insanely frustrating when it's not working.\n\nIMHO the ATM operators and manufacturers need to properly band together and make sure some site or service like coinatmradar (doesn't have to be them, although it seems the obvious choice) or better yet some API, ALWAYS and AUTOMATICALLY have the correct information. It shouldn't be rocket science when you consider that every machine by definition is online and set up to exchange data.

This is usually within 15min of being made aware of the issue. \n\nWe operators also have problems keeping bitcoin in stock since many are bootstrapping their business, having banking issues and/or experiencing an explosion in volume growth. \n\nCreating a way to make customers aware of ATM status is a problem that is technologically fixable but we need the manufacturers to provide the functionality. CoinATMradar does have an API but I don't believe it was designed to work as a heartbeat/in stock communicator for the ATMs. \n\nThis thread is great for bringing awareness to the issue. Thanks to the OP and commenters. ": 3, "You are concentrating on fixed costs, however, there are many other factors influencing price setting. E.g. as a localbitcoiner you are risking to meet someone you don't know - risk of robbery, risk of getting legal prosecution as you are conducting business without proper registration/license. So I would say different factors might equate each other in my opinion.\n\nAlso don't forget average bitcoin ATM fee now is about 7%.\n\nHere is a short calculation:\n\n- average bitcoin ATM volume - $30K per month\n\n- 10% fee\n\n- $5K cost of two-way machine (BitXatm), $3K cost of one way machine (General Bytes) (90% of volume now is buy bitcoin, not sell - so one-way might work good at current market state)\n\n- serve machine yourself (grab cash periodically)\n\n- find a friendly store to place your machine w/o rent in exchange for new customers traffic\n\nYou get $3K per month in gross profit, so basically it covers the cost of machine in 1 month (of course, this volume appears not immediately, but after 5-6 months).\n\nIf you did any business before, you know that ROI of 1 year is something normal, it can be 2-3 years if there are substantial investments.\n\nNow assume you are an operator who launches 10 machines, let's make them Satoshi1 machines with cost $6K each. So you invest $60K for getting hardware.\n\nLegal costs (not sure about U.S. laws as vary from state to state, know that some operators run machines in particular states by having bitcoins in hot wallet, so recognized as no money transmitters) - I'm not legal expert, but let's put $100K as initial legal costs for 1 state.\n\nNow every place you rent for $500/month and have cash taking service for $2K per month to serve all your 10 machines.\n\nVolume assumed still $30K/month (however, there are cases when monthly volume is $200K or more per machine - I know such operators).\n\nSo per year volume is $30K * 10 * 12 = $3.6Mio, your gross profit (10%) is $360K, after sharing 1% of turnover with Genesis Coin - you are left with $324K per year.\n\nInitial costs = $60K (hardware) + $100K legal costs = $160K\n\nRunning costs = $2K + $0.5K = $2.5K * 12 months = $30K per year\n\nSo after year 1 you have $324 - $160 - $30 = $134K net profits or $10K per month, which is even enough to cover work of 2 people, one is you taking care about accounting and compliance, second guy - support.\nYear two will bring you $324 - $30 = $294K or $24.5K per month, not bad. So even at very early market - bitcoin ATM business can be profitable at 10% for sure.\n\nNow imagine what will happen if any kind of significant adoption happens? And you are already there with bitcoin ATMs at different locations and which run smoothly with established reputation.\n\nFigures above are very rough, but I think reflect the reality.\n\nSo if you share your vision on figures to justify that 10% is too small - will be interesting to check it.\n\nEdit: formatting.": 1, 'What!

Another one probably "Henley Vaporium" - also online pricing is available.\n\nRegarding incorrect fees - it is really hard to track how operators change stuff, and regarding this 15/18% you mentioned, it was reported by operator as 15%, although online prices indicated that the fee is actually about 17-18%, which I asked the operator and have not received the answer yet (machines were added recently).\n\nAnyway, I\'m working on some updates on the site, when fees field will be updated in almost online mode, of course, for those which provide feeds. So stay tuned, coinatmradar will do his job! I always vote for transparent information and sometimes struggling with operators about it.

Then you can take the same Ledger USB and plug it into your computer and use it there.

Just in case you\'re looking for a challenge...\n\n\n# How to Steal My 16+ Bitcoins #\n\nNo system is perfectly secure, but I\'ve tried to make it so I\'m not the easiest target. Let\'s say you want to steal my wallet by cracking into my system (e.g. breaking passwords, infecting my systems with malware, exploiting a security bug) or coming to my house.\n\n## Breaking Passwords\n\nAll of my passwords are at least 15 characters long with a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, symbols, and no dictionary words or similar alternatives. Basically they look like gibberish. The only weakness I can think of here is that I don\'t change them as often as I should. Guess what I\'m doing this afternoon.\n\n## Malware\n\nI don\'t run any version of Windows or OSX, so your options are limited. My hardware firewall runs malware detection, so anything I try to download is checked. My Android phone and tablet could be vulnerable, but I only keep a little bit of bitcoin on the phone. Also, they can only connect to the wifi AP on my DMZ network. My secure network with my NAS and desktop system are protected from my DMZ network.\n\n## Security Exploits\n\nLet\'s say you\'re looking for security vulnerabilities in my networks and systems. Generally I try to minimize the programs and services running on my devices to only the ones I actually use, and I check for updates and install them daily. You\'ll have to hack your way through:\n\n* A hardware firewall running network intrusion detection and malware detection.\n* A network switch to my DMZ network.\n\nOn my DMZ network you have access to devices like my Nest, Roku, TV, Xbox, and wifi AP. You\'ll need to keep going to get to my secure network to claim your prize.\n\n* Another hardware firewall to my secure network.\n* Another switch.\n\nNow you\'re on my secure network. The only two systems here are my desktop computer (running Linux) and my NAS (running FreeBSD). I\'ve locked down ports to the bare minimum (e.g. ssh and cifs on my NAS). Both systems use full disk encryption, and are running intrusion detection software. Root login is disabled; you\'ll have to break in as another user who has sudo privileges. In the browser on my desktop I use plugins like HTTPS Everywhere, Privacy Badger, uBlock Origin, etc.\n\n## Coming to My House\n\nMaybe you could break in, and steal my computers (again, they use full disk encryption). First you\'ll need to find out where I live, which is a bit harder since all my Internet traffic flows through my hardware firewall, which maintains a VPN connection. It might look like I\'m in Texas or Kansas or Seattle, but I\'m not. Search my reddit history and you might find the state I live in.\n\nMy name is not really Enrique Montalvo. I\'m a white dude with a name like Bob Johnson. I keep a separate browser profile for this pseudonym that has never been associated with me IRL. Enrique Montalvo has a gmail account, Twitter account, etc. I\'m still trying to figure out how to get a truly anonymous phone so I can get a Facebook account. I may be good, but I\'m not yet a Rembrandt!\n\nIf you somehow figure out where I live you\'ll have to get through my physical security (e.g. alarm system, camera, dog).\n\nI keep a 5TB encrypted USB drive with backups of my data in a gun safe in the basement. The most important two words in that last sentense are "gun safe". ;) It\'s bolted to the concrete floor. The USB drive contained within could be up to a week out of date, but it will have a copy of my wallet. You\'ll need the safe combination and a physical key to open it, or maybe just a big-ass plasma cutter.\n\nYou could try social engineering your way in, but I\'m a slightly paranoid introvert with trust issues.\n\nYou could try kidnapping and torturing me for the entire 16 BTC, but when I\'m home I\'m armed. If you take me by surprise (and we both survive) then I\'ll just give you what you want. You earned it. You better sweep the bitcoin into your own wallet and hold onto me until the transaction is confirmed, otherwise I\'ll just sweep it into a new wallet of my own. Or just kill me, then I\'ll have bigger problems to worry about.\n\n## One Does Not Simply Walk Into Enrique Montalvo\'s Wallet\n\nIf you have my wallet, congrats! Just figure out the password for it and you\'re all set.\n\nI may have left out some important details in all of this that would make things even harder for you. ;-)\n': 1}, ('Good news, comment scores are back!', 0): {'yes, they are not back :(': 1, "i dont understand why they appear sometimes but I'm sure that thermos guy is unable to listen to reason in his endless wisdom, so they're probably not back.": 1}, ('Coinbase shut me down', 29): {"It's a federal MSB license, and yes many states require one at the state level as well, which I do have for 2 states.": 1, "Federal MSB isn't that hard, but some states have complex regulations": 1, 'If the amounts were over $1000 throughout the year, the person giving you USD is the money transmitter.': 1, 'Question to you all...

Therefore, a conflict of interest can be discovered and voluntarily defused before any corruption occurs. A widely used definition is: "A conflict of interest is a set of circumstances that creates a risk that professional judgement or actions regarding a primary interest will be unduly influenced by a secondary interest."[1] Primary interest refers to the principal goals of the profession or activity, such as the protection of clients, the health of patients, the integrity of research, and the duties of public office. Secondary interest includes not only financial gain but also such motives as the desire for professional advancement and the wish to do favours for family and friends, but conflict of interest rules usually focus on financial relationships because they are relatively more objective, fungible, and quantifiable. The secondary interests are not treated as wrong in themselves, but become objectionable when they are believed to have greater weight than the primary interests. **The conflict in a conflict of interest exists whether or not a particular individual is actually influenced by the secondary interest. It exists if the circumstances are reasonably believed (on the basis of past experience and objective evidence) to create a risk that decisions may be unduly influenced by secondary interests.**\n\nIn this case, Blockstream financially benefits from the lightning network being successful. If fees remain low on the blockchain, that reduces the reasons to use the lightning network.  Therefore, it\'s in Blockstreams financial interest, to have smaller blocks that create a scarce environment to encourage the user of their network due to higher fees on the blockchain.\n\nTo deny the conflict of interest just brings your own judgement into question. \n\nIt would be more appropriate to say, yes it exists, but they are not behaving incorrectly.

Back then mining was done mostly by hobbyists and enthusiasts, who were either mining as individuals or running a small business. \n\nLarge mining operations appeared later. Obviously, they (especially mining equipment manufacturers who are mining themselves) have much more power than individuals.\n\nSo they can try various optimizations which boost their profits even if they potentially hurt Bitcoins security. E.g. SPV mining, it's already observed in practice.\n\nMoreover, if a group of miners can somehow steal profits of other group of miners, they can definitely try that. And as the selfish miner paper, as well as Peter Todd's calculations demonstrate, it's theoretically possible in certain circumstances.\n\nAnd thus we should be very cautious. If big blocks can be used to manipulate the network it's certainly a possibility which should be considered.\n\nThe landscape have drastically changed since 2013.
