And the only reason that the person I trade with will be willing to trade me for my money is because they\'ll be making the same kind of prediction. (It\'s turtles all the way down.) But my speculation that others will value Bitcoin in the future isn\'t based on "faith" or arbitrary "belief." It\'s based on my observation that Bitcoin has really excellent monetary properties (in short, it combines the reliable scarcity of a commodity like gold with the transactional efficiency of a purely digital medium).  As a result of those properties, I predict that, over time, Bitcoin may be able to steal significant monetary "market share" from other forms of money that lack those properties (e.g. gold and fiat).': 7, 'No component of value can be coherently called "intrinsic." It is all subjective, because valuation is meaningless without reference to someone who values the thing in question. \n\nAn item\'s utility for a given purpose may be an objective fact, and it might work to call that utility intrinsic, but we must be careful to distinguish between utility *for a given purpose* and utility *to someone*. The first could be said to be objective or maybe intrinsic, but the second obviously cannot, since usefulness to a person doesn\'t inhere in the item but in the desire of that person to achieve a given end (purpose). \n\nIt is always and in every way wrong to call value intrinsic. Something can be universally valued, and it can be objectively useful for a given purpose, but people\'s valuation of achieving that end is subjective. We could try to say that a hammer intrinsically valuable for driving in nails, but there we are simply using the word *valuable* as a synonym of *useful* - it could be valued by someone, but need not be since no one necessarily wants to drive a nail. \n\nValue is a verb; "intrinsically valued" makes no sense.': 1, 'Indeed, many good with use value had an exchange value in the past.\n\nRice for example were "Durable, Divisible, Transportable, Unspoofable" and thus used as a medium of exchange.\n\nGold arose from the same reason, their initial acceptability was rooted not in belief of a medium of exchange, but in their use/industrial value. \n\nThis use value is what some people call "inherent value", which is a term that is so vague and used for all reason that it lost its meaning. Which is why I prefer saying "use/industrial value".\n\nThe use/industrial value of gold is not really relevant compared to its exchange value nowadays. But the reason why it started to be used as a medium of exchange was because of its use value in jewel, and the divisibility/durability/transportable/unspoofable properties I enumerated.\n\nPeople who says "bitcoin can\'t succeed as a currency because of no inherent value" are referring to this initial use value that can spark a new money in the first place.\nThe response to give to them is not that Bitcoin has no inherent value, but that it has. (the blockchain)\n\nThis plus the fact that this is durable, divisible, transportable and unspoofable above all competing currencies make it a great candidate for use as a currency. \n\nWhich is why you can say (and I quote you) : "How could it ever lose its exchange value if it has a use for a group of people", response : "It can\'t"\n\nHowever you can observe that rice lost its exchange value.

Since we have new bitcoins being created daily, the currency is both inflationary in the sense that it\'s literally an increase in the supply of money, as well as inflationary as in the buying power of a particular bitcoin is made to be less. This is the same problem that reserve notes have, but with bitcoin the effect is more dramatic. Since the "amount of bitcoin existing" inflation is controlled by an algorithm, we can only stifle the effects of it by means of decreasing the actualized amount of bitcoin available on the market, ie "hodling". \n\nThis is economics 101, simply supply vs demand stuff. \n\n>And as I said that\'s a terrible indicator of the health of an economy.\n\nYou need to back this up with something. \n\nYou can have transactions going like crazy in an economy and still have no wealth.

Something needs to have value before it can have mainstream adoption.

Currently it means that the people who buy or trade bitcoins must put 1.3 million dollars into the system just to maintain the network.  It is hard to separate that loss from price changes due to other causes, but it surely contributes to the devaluation that bitcoin has suffered in 2014.\n\nPart of that 1.3 million US$/day goes into paying the actual costs of mining (equipment, rent, electricity, salaries, etc.), and part goes into the miners\' pockets as profits.  It is unclear how profitable mining is at present. However, since it is a free market, if the price remains minimally stable for a year or so, the industry should adjust so that the profits are 10-20% of the revenue, not much more.  Therefore, a rough guess for the actual cost of the network (minus miners\' profits) today is about 1 million US$/day.  With the present traffic, that is about 20$ per transaction, or 2% of the total transaction amount (excluding obvious change-backs).  \n\nIt is hard to guess what the cost per transaction (or, more importantly, per BTC transferred) will be when the inflation tax is replaced by transition fees as the main revenue source for the miner\'s network.  It depends on an unpredictable variable, which is the total daily transaction volume in USD at the time.  \n\nThe fees then can be expected to be around 2% of the transaction amount, to maximize the miners revenue while keeping the system competitive with other forms of payment.

Therefore, JP Morgan Chase will have trouble manipulating the price since they would have to create "paper" bitcoin that doesn\'t actually exist but that people actually agree to buy. The reason people may be averse to "paper" bitcoin is because it would actually be easier to buy real bitcoin than paper bitcoin whereas with gold, obtaining real gold/silver and storing and securing and trading it is actually not as simple (think transport, shipping, insurance, etc.) which is why trading "paper" silver/gold is attractive and the fake paper has demand.\n\nEDIT: after second thought, I don\'t know if they\'ll have trouble manipulating the price, but I do think it will be harder for them due to the public ledger (there is no public ledger of gold/silver and which wallet owns which chunk of metal... I think when they "rent out" the metals, multiple people can actually own the same metal which is akin to multiple addresses having the same bitcoin in it which from my knowledge isn\'t possible).

By non-exclusionary, I mean it's impossible for anyone to opt-out of being a part of these ring signatures. So, when Alice spends her owned output, she sends them from Bob OR Alice OR Joe OR Cindy's output. This could be included in Bitcoin as a softfork, but likely won't be available until a sidechain comes out that supports it, e.g. the one andytoshi and gmaxwell are working on.

Displayed ECG does not reflect the fidelity of the internal signal representation.\n\n> A single lead II ECG vector cannot give you some of the details they claim to be able to recognise (size and orientation of the heart muscle)\n\nWe talk about the fact that heart characteristics (e.g., size, orientation, etc.) affect the ECG morphology (this is the underlying principle of ECG biometrics).

That's how doctors can read an ECG\n\nIt's true that the general biological functions that give rise to the ECG signal are common. It is also true that the variations of the human body create unique and consistent features in the ECG signal for each person. This was an observation made decades ago, which ultimately led to a whole field of research that is ECG biometric recognition. To get a sense of the amount of research out there, here is a survey paper from 2012: Odinaka, et al, [ECG Biometric Recognition: A Comparative Analysis](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?reload=true&arnumber=6287579)\n\n> Take your pulse. Now take a deep breath in. Notice it slowing down? That's a change in the spacing of individual contractions, but the conducting pathways causing the contractions are still firing identically each time your heart beats, for your entire life.\n\nSee above. On a general note, researchers are constantly on the lookout for physiological or behavioural traits that are:\na) consistent (i.e., relatively permanent) for each person; and\nb) unique between people\n\nIf there is a trait that has this set of characteristics, it can potentially be used for biometric recognition. The ECG falls into this category (and, as the paper above indicates, plenty of researchers have been doing this for years now). The challenge is how to consistently extract those features when there are also natural variations (e.g., in the case of ECG, one of the variations is heart rate), and is also among other features that are common to all people (but this is less of an issue as machine learning algorithms filter out these features). We have a unique set of algorithms that does this. It's not that different from other biometrics -- all biometric have to deal with variations in the captured signal, as well as common features that are not useful for identity recognition. \n\n> Can you recognise an individual car from its cylinder timings? Sufficiently uniquely across the entire population of cars out there?\n\nAn interesting research question! You may be surprised at the kinds of insight you can gather when you capture signals of sufficient fidelity. Consider the old days of forensic investigation where variations in typewriters were used to identify who wrote a particular letter. This is not terribly different from modern research into biometrics.\n\nWe are very open about how our system works and happy to have it scrutinized.

During authentication, the Nymi is able to ignore noise from recording artifacts that result from breathing, body movement or an inadequate connection and instead focus on pattern recognition to either accept or reject the user. Nymi\xe2\x80\x99s pattern recognition engine uses a combination of second order statistics to extract unique ECG features. This allows the ECG wave to be analyzed for repeated unique patterns while factoring out artifacts\nand incidental forms.

It is totally disingenuous to compare bitcoin to equity in solid companies.\n\nThe price of stocks like TSLA and AMZN is largely determined by their expected dividends and capital assets, so if all the existing stock were offered for sale it would find buyers not much below their current market value.  For example, if a share of FUBR is expected to yield 10$ in dividends over the next year, investors will gladly pay 100$ for it,  no matter how many are on sale, because it will give 10% return on investment just on its first year.  If a company owns a oil rig valued at 100 M$, and has 1 M shares, people will easily pay 80$ or more per share, no matter how many shares are available for sale.\n\nWhereas the price of bitcoin is entirely determined by the fuzzy expectation that  it will somehow have another 1000% bubble in the future; and those who believe in that miracle are few and without money to spare. So, if the old-timers started selling their hoards, they would not find buyers, and the price would crash. \n\nThere are 13 million BTC at present.

Suppose each coin stays out of circulation for 7 days, on average, before being sold again.  Then, that activity will need an amount of bitcoins worth 7 x 5 M$ = 35 M$.  In that case, the market price of each BTC will be about 35 M$ / 13 M BTC, or about 3 $/BTC.': 1, '> There are 13 million BTC at present.

Your math is fine, but your assumptions regarding the inputs are very far off base. First of all, estimated average daily transaction volume is closer to 30 million USD per day (source: blockchain.info), but this does not even account for off-chain transactions etc. and furthermore does not account for peak transaction volume.  Furthermore, the supply of available bitcoin in circulation (i.e. bitcoin not being saved) is far less than 13 million. This number is far more difficult to estimate, but based on current exchange volume, the number of bitcoins is likely to be lower than 13 million by one or more orders of magnitude, which, by your analysis, puts the "fundamental" value of bitcoin in the hundreds of USD. \n\nOf course, like many technology stocks, the valuation of bitcoin is also dependent on other factors such as expectations of future network demand as well as pure speculation. The argument that bitcoin somehow has no or little intrinsic value has been done to death and is false. Yes, bitcoin is not a company in the traditional sense, but to claim the transaction network (and all sorts of Blockchain 2.0 tech coming soon) itself has little to no value is extremely foolish.   \n\nPlease come back when you have a reasonable and rigorous analysis to present.

I am merely pointing out that this is also true of stocks as well. The valuations of some stocks, like bitcoin, are also driven in part by speculation regarding their future "underlying value" (see TSLA, AMZN before they were profitable, etc.), but this does not mean that their market cap is somehow less valid.\n\nJust to drive my point home so you can hopefully understand it this time, you say\n\n>It is a very lose cap, because the price would crash if that were to happen **(unlike most ordinary stock)**\n\nThis part in bold is total nonsense.

Then, you have coinage. The state monopolizes coinage, because it sees this allows it to debase the currency to its own benefit. This happened in ancient times, beginning in Lydia at some point of the first (?) millennium before the current era, and I\'m a bit too lazy to Google the exact point.\n\nAfterwards, people realize carrying metal is clumsy, so banks arise: places where bullion is stored in exchange for a certificate, which then begins to be used as a substitute for money.\n\nAs long as the market is free (other than that state intervention which is the debasement of coinage), banks must operate at a reserve ratio the market accepts. (I [mentioned](http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/2qmmp8/the_more_and_more_i_learn_about_the_history_of/cn7t2ss) this on a side thread).\n\nThen comes central banking: since legal tender laws have allowed banks to create money like there is no tomorrow, on the false pretense it is backed by bullion, there is the occasional, recurring need to bail out banks. Besides, the state wants in on the massive transfer of wealth fractional reserve banking operates towards those allowed to create money.\n\nA central bank allows the state to accomplish both these objectives (bail out banks and get its share of the wealth transfer). So, in the US, for example, the Federal Reserve system was created in 1913.\n\nPeople could still protect themselves from the debasement of currency through money creation by the Fed by using gold. This is why Herr F. Roosevelt confiscated everyone\'s gold about a month into his presitatorship. Gold remained illegal for private individuals in the US to hold until after the final step of this process: the end of convertibility of dollars into gold in 1971.\n\nSince people had already conformed to money having no real value other than that the government decreed it to have, there was no point in even pretending it was actually backed by bullion. (What\'s the point of a gold standard system if you are forbidden from converting your bills into bullion, unless, like in the Bretton Woods system, you\'re a foreign power?) So the government simply said - dollars aren\'t backed by gold anymore. You still have to accept them, or else...\n\nIn short, every fiat currency in the world is "backed" by the threat of your debtors being legally allowed to default on their debt should you refuse to accept payment in that specific kind of colorful paper. Other nations\' legal tender laws are even harsher than America\'s - you\'re not allowed to refuse their decreed colorful paper even if there is no outstanding debt - you cannot legally operate a bitcoin-only business, as you are in America.\n\nIn short, the state forces people to accept paper without any relation whatsoever with real value, like I said in my previous post.': 1, "The difference is that this doesn't *have* to occur with bitcoin. This is because you can mathematically prove that you have full reserves with bitcoin, and you can't do that with any other currency. The other difference is that, with bitcoin, being your own bank is no less convenient than keeping your coins in a bank. The same stuff that happened with fiat currencies is bound to happen with bitcoin: bank runs, heists, etc. The difference is that this time around, there's another option. You don't *have* to put your money in a bank. So after an initial period of turmoil, people will probably opt to simply hold their own private keys, once personal digital security has improved enough for this strategy to be viable for the average person. ": 3, "The crucial matter with fractional reserve banking (FRB) is legal tender.\n\nIn a free market (i.e. a market free from legal tender laws), FR banks must keep a reserve ratio compatible with what the market expects. If they don't, they fail - people simply stop accepting their paper money, because they know it is worthless as it is not actually backed by bullion.\n\nOnce legal tender kicks in, people are forced (literally) to accept that worthless paper. This allows banks to lower their reserves to insane levels, enriching themselves in the process - they create new money but pay old prices.\n\nThe way I see it, bitcoin FRB would have to operate off-blockchain (as mining is the *only* way bitcoins can ever be created, and lending is *not* mining). This would immediately be a red flag for sensible agents, limiting the harm FRB could cause.\n\nIn short, I think Bitcoin offers a reasonable level of protection against FRB.": 3, 'MtGox did operate on fractional reserve quick enough.': 2, "How can I know that they are including every customer's money in the solvency report?

Fractional reserve is fraud. \n\nWith bitcoins, if you don\'t have the keys, you don\'t have the bitcoins.\n\nFortunately, it\'s possible to have your bitcoins protected by 2 of 3 multisig, storing one of the keys in an online "bank", another on your phone and the third one safely offline. That way, you can be sure your bitcoins are not being moved to a new address and be sure the "bank" is not doing fractional reserve with your bitcoins. To spend your bitcoins, you login into the "bank", and sign with your online key and phone key.\n\nI hope nobody stores their bitcoins in places like changetip, coinbase, etc... where they can move your coins and make fractional reserve.': 7, "In it's current form, bitcoin is not useful for credit.  This is because bitcoin is two things: sound money and ultimately deflationary.\n\nBitcoin is sound money because it is not token redeemable for an asset, it is the asset itself; much the same as gold.  If you hold the private key, you own the bitcoin, simple as that.  This doesn't stop one form making loans with it in and of itself, however...\n\nBitcoin is ultimately deflationary, meaning that in the future, there will be less of a supply of bitcoin than in the present, even though bitcoin is inflationary at the present time.  This being the case, if you loan to somebody in bitcoin over a long period of time, you run a much higher risk of not only not making a profit, but never getting your principle back.  I call this the Mortgage problem.  Why would you loan somebody a bitcoin for 30 years to buy a house when in 30 years that house will almost certainly be worth less than a bitcoin?  You wouldn't.\n\nThe risks of lending in bitcoin outweight the benefits in the long run.\n\nSo what is the solution?  A 2-way pegged side-chain with market determined inflation within set parameters.  This will allow for an inflationary currency to be 100% backed by bitcoin.  In this currency, the market will have an acceptable  level of risk because the collateral will always appreciate in the currency that the loan was made.  I dunno, call it loancoin.  This was not possible before crypto, because if a currency was backed by a reserve (such as gold) there was no way to ensure the reserve was 100% because people (banks) cheat. Now we can.

Fractional reserve banking is a problem in our system mostly because of how it combines with loose monetary policy, to exacerbate asset bubbles caused by excessive liquidity.\n\nActual cash is a tiny percentage of the money value in the world's economy.

Basically, you are offloading the volatility risk to that site, replacing it with a counterparty risk.\n\n3) Some exchanges (I think one of the Chinese ones, but I don\'t know for sure) allows you to trade Bitcoin derivatives such as futures. When you buy bitcoins, you are essentially going long bitcoins. You can offset that by selling short a bitcoin futures contract.

However, derivatives trading has its own set of risks and costs and you really ought not to engage in it unless you are an experienced speculator.\n\nBut, yeah, Bitcoin is too volatile to be used as a store of value - and that is not likely to change any time soon.

As the country\'s economy gets stronger, or weaker, so does its currency. Some people have made a lot of money on such investments (George Soros). But the problem with dollars is that their amount is not fixed, it\'s impossible to predict when more will be dumped on the market, and it\'s impossible to know the number of outstanding "shares." So it doesn\'t compare to stocks very well.\n\n> No cash flows.\n\nAre you sure us dollar cash has no cash flow? What do you mean when you say cash flows?\n\n> There is no such conglomerate (I bet you don\'t even know what that word means). There are different businesses, with different business models, with different profits.\n\nYou just wrote the definition of a conglomerate. Different businesses, with different business models, with different profits, all a part of a larger whole. I think you don\'t know what that word means. For example, 3M is a famous conglomerate, manufacturing "adhesives, abrasives, laminates, passive fire protrction, dental and orthodontic products, electronic materials, medical products, car care products, electronic circuits, and optical firlms." 3M\'s goal is to invent something new every year, kr buy a company that did, and sell off any companies that are underperforming. When you invest in 3M stock, you are not investing in a single business, you are investing in, as you said, "different businesses, with different business models, with different profits." AmEx is not a conglomerate, but Bitcoin is very similar to one.\n\n> It is perfectly apropros, demonstrating why an investor (like Buffett) would invest in AmEx and not, for instance, in Coinbase or Facebook.\n\nSo, because Buffet only invests in large, established, non-tech businesses, Google, stock is pure speculation, and shouldn\'t be invested in?

It is regulated and less likely to be a scam than a company that used to be trading collectibles till recently.\n\nThe fact that every stock share sold on the stock market today has an average of four claimants to it, due to lack of safety regulations forbidding fractional reserve types of activities by brokerages, and that if there was a run on the sale of stocks, your shares could end up being worthless scams (did you know about this?), and the fact that the only thing the stock market regulates for is making sure that the shares are legitimate, not that the underlying businesses themselves aren\'t scams (which happens more often than it should) aside...\nWhat is it about owning bitcoin that makes you think you are being scammed? You either own a share in an economy thatis rapidly expanding with a lot of new businesses, or you don\'t. Hell, one of the long term plans is to move all stock trades entirely onto blockchain technologies, making most of what the stock market uses regulations for obsolete.\n\n>> Would you not have invested in Google, Facebook, or Twitter when they were privately traded?\n\n> I wouldn\'t. That would have been a speculation, not an investment.\n\nYou should probably read this http://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/09/difference-between-investing-speculating.asp\n\nGoogle, Facebook, and Twitter were very well established companies pre-IPO, with a large enough customer base, and advanced enough technology and competitive advantage that there was little chance they would fail. It\'s the same deal with bitcoin.\n\n> Bitcoin has no cash flow and no profits \n\nNeither do stocks! The companies that you own a share of have cash flow and profits, which usually translate into shares of stock going up as the company assets increase, either from their inventory going up in value, or **more cash going going into the company.** Does that sound familiar? What happens when bitcoin services are used by users? More cash goes into bitcoin.\n\n> And neither is gold, BTW - which is why Buffett doesn\'t "invest" in it, either. \n\nI would have thought it was because gold is a terrible investment, only gaining 3% return over it\'s life long term. And yeah, gold is a speculative investment, with its price being almost entirely from it being used as a store or value or a hedge against other currencies, not as part of any business or service that actually generates cash flow.\n\n> But at least it is possible to invest in Microsoft. It is not possible to invest in Bitcoin \n\nSure it is. Finished reading that investopedia article? Now look at the fundamentals of bitcoin.

LOTS of fundamentals to consider and invest based on. Why do you think the general feelin g around bitcoin is that it because!e much stronger in 2014, despite the drop in price? Its because the fundamentals have improved so much. You don\'t have that in speculations.\n\n> But it is still not investing, because you are not buying a claim on a business\' long-term cash flows.\n\nWhen I buy bitcoin, and the reason I hold it, is because I am buying a claim on bitcoin infrastructure\'s long term cash flows.

Would you not have invested in Google, Facebook, or Twitter when they were privately traded (and worth 1/1000th of current price) even if you had the chance? Or is it that you want SEC approval before investing in it?\n\nMy point is that speculation is basically looking at something with very little background, and betting on it in hopes that it will be adopted and take off. You have no trading history or fundamentals to examine. It really is a bet and a hope. Bitcoin has a lot of trading history and fundamentals to look at, and can be evaluated and invested in based on its business activity and development plans. Truez you don\'t have a single organization with financials and plans to look at, and instead have to look at the progress of a few decentralized and independent entities, but it\'s still something you can examine, make informed decisions on, and invest in without it just being a bet.': 1, "Bitcoin is silicon valley's quest to obsolete wall st.": 2, 'Speculation is stuff like options, or betting on whether the price will go up or down. Investing is evaluating the potentials of a company or technology, and investing money in it in to both help it grow, and in hopes that it will grow and earn you money back. People who invested in things like Facebook, Twitter, and Google knew what they were investing in. They weren\'t speculating. The things you care and not care about is risk. You don\'t want the extra risk from investing in a company or technology that is not well established in, despite the higher risk possibly bringing a higher reward. You want a low risk investment, where the risks of fluctuation or failure are low (but still always exist), because the company is already well established. And that\'s fine. Different people have different risk tolerance, and different situations require different risk too (if you are 65, I wouldn\'t recommend moving your retirement to risky stocks, **even AmEx**)\n\nEven if it\'s a Bitcoin-related business that is generating steady profits, that won\'t necessarily give you more security, since the business may still fail. Nor would it necessarily give you a better risk-vs-return than bitcoin itself, since if there is a bitcoin business big enough to be "safe" and generate a steady return, then chances are that by that point bitcoin itself is safe, steady, and is appreciating in value at a steady return.

And this doesn't count off-chain users (who exchange coins via Coinbase or Changetip, for instance). This growth pattern occurred during what it likely to be the most volatile and difficult part of bitcoin's life cycle.  Getting from zero to one is always the hardest part. \n\nSo, if current trend holds, we are no more more than 11 years away from half the world's population using Bitcoin on a daily basis.  Do the math for yourself, if you like.  \n\nOf course, the trend could accelerate or decelerate. But given the known tendency of open-source information technologies to continue, if not accelerate, on their exponential adoption pattern once it's firmly established, my guess is that Bitcoin will be no differently. And three years (longer really) is enough time in my mind to firmly establish the pattern. \n\nRather that Bitcoin proponents having to continually explain why this pattern is likely to hold, it's increasingly incumbent upon its detractors to explain why it will not. Gox didn't stop it.  Extreme price volatility hasn't stopped it.  Regulations haven't stopped it.  Warren Buffett hasn't stopped it.  \n\nIt's increasingly difficult to imagine what will stop it.

If the USD network effect would crush BTC, it would have done it when Bitcoin was $0, $0.1, $1, $2 or $3.
