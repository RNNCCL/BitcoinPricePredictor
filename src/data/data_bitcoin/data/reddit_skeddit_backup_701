Always fun to keep track, not so much on particular dates "predicted" but general technologies (self-driving cars? partial check; hover-cars? less of a check).\n\nThe two that come to mind off-hand are "Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom" by Cory Doctorow (free), which is less focused on the "crypto" part, but is absolutely a post-scarcity cybercurrency (and to the canny observer, crypto is probably implied in that).

If I wanted a console, I'd buy a PS4/Xbone. They are trying to stick two completely different demographics together in my mind. (I can see this argument existing even in the development office)\n\nSee, I disagree. What they're trying to do is lure console gamers away from their consoles. Once you have them on a PC, even one masquerading as a console, then you can slowly peel back the layers, guiding them to ascension.\n\nThat being said, there are some games that just work better with controllers, IMHO. I'd rather play racing games with a controller than a keyboard and mouse, and when you're playing a platformer (like *BattleBlock Theater*, or *Lego Marvel Superheroes* for example) or something that plays like one (say *Dungeon Defenders*, *Bit Trip Runner*, or *Edge*) it's nice to lean back with the controller for that kind of stuff.\n\n>Source Engine 2 -> Something is going on here, theres a lot of weird deep level stagnation going on with all their existing engines that indicates to me at least that they are pouring their resources into something else?\n\nYour guess is as good as mine.\n\n>(Hopefully Source 2 or even Source 3 if it exists)\n\nNot possible.

Gold trades at $1,665 per troy ounce, setting a break-even price of $518-million per ounce troy for space-gold to break even.\n\nhttp://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/economy/economy-lab/why-asteroid-mining-wont-spark-interstellar-gold-rush/article4103471/": 1, "I suggest you read up on the subject more before throwing around numbers like $100k/ounce.\n\nThe calculations for a mining ship are in [my book](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Space_Transport_and_Engineering_Methods/Orbital_Mining2#Bulk_Regolith_Return_Mission), so I won't repeat the details here.  \n\nWith an empty mass of 10 tons, plus 23 tons of fuel, it can bring back 1000 tons of rock.  Since you can extract 200 tons of fuel out of the 1000 tons of rock, later trips don't require more from Earth.  One ship can be expected to make ~7 trips before replacement, so total mass return is 7000 tons.\n\nThe [Falcon 9](http://www.spacex.com/falcon9) can deliver 13 tons to orbit, so two flights can transport the mining ship and a partial fuel load.  The first trip would bring back a reduced cargo, after that it would be fully fueled.\n\nThe market value of 1200 net tons of fuel in high orbit, at $2000/kg, is $2.4 billion.  The mining ship and processing plant, based on similar space hardware, should run about $600 million each, and two Falcon 9 launches are $125 million.  That leaves a comfortable profit margin.\n\nIf you try an extract precious metals, you would get 7000 tons x 0.1% concentration = 7 tons, with a market value of  ~$1000/oz average = $30k/kg = $30M/ton.  That nets $210 million, which is not enough to cover costs.

The article is old, so adjust metals prices to today.\n\n> Now consider that you have taken into account the orbit of eros \n\nAs I mentioned in another comment for this article, [433 Eros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/433_Eros) is a stony (S-type) asteroid, which is the wrong kind.  You want one of the metallic asteroids, because the precious metals are associated with iron.  That's why they are rare on the Earth's surface, most of it sank to the core.\n\nThe rest of your question is irrelevant, because one of the other 12,000 and growing [Near Earth Asteroids](http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/stats/) is what you would go after, whichever has the best orbit and right composition.  We are finding over 1000 new ones a year, so there are plenty to choose from.\n\nAs far as radiation, grabbing a small asteroid (1000 tons or less) is an unmanned operation, so it doesn't matter.  You don't land on it.

Most of the value would be in Platinum and Rhodium, though, not gold.  It would also have a mass of about 4 billion tons.  So the ore value would be $1250/ton, or $1.25/kg.\n\nGiven that launching anything into orbit today is at least $1600/kg, we would need very efficient mining processes to do it profitably.  In all probability we need a large reduction in launch costs, plus building a lot of the equipment on-site out of the asteroid itself.  Metallic asteroids are typically iron-nickel alloys, which is a pretty good building material.

It\'s like estimating the cost of an open-pit copper mine at the rate the exploration geologist charges for assay samples.  OSIRIS-REX is a prospecting mission, not a bulk mining operation.\n\nThey also mis-understand the point of early asteroid mining.  The early market is materials for use in space.  For example, propellants for communications satellites and future missions to the Moon or Mars.  Rocket fuel is pretty cheap.  Getting it to a high orbit currently costs ~$5000/kg.  Some Near-Earth asteroids are ~20% easily extracted fuel - water and carbon, from which you produce Oxygen and Hydrocarbons.  A mining tug can haul about 350 times it\'s own starting mass in asteroid rock back to high orbit over a typical operating life.  That converts to 70 times its starting mass in fuel.  It uses 5 time its starting mass in fuel to do the hauling, leaving a net surplus of 65 times.\n\nSo on a mass basis, the mining tug gets fuel to high orbit way cheaper than launching it from Earth.  The economic questions are (1) whether the cost of building and running the tug and the fuel extraction plant can be low enough, and (2) if there is a big enough market for products like fuel.\n\nIn mining there is this idea called "ore value", which is the price of the product you sell times the concentration in the ore.  So fuel at 20% x $5000/kg value = $1000/kg ore value.  Precious metals at perhaps 0.1% concentration in a good asteroid x $30,000/kg street value = $30/kg ore value.  So fuel is the more important market.  Sure, get some precious metals out later as a bonus, but start with fuel, and other bulk commodities you can get in large quantity.': 1, "Exactly. A cup of coffee in China is not the same as a cup of coffee in New York. The former might be 10 times cheaper than the latter, but that doesn't make coffee any cheaper in New York.\n\nSimilarly, the presence of gold on some asteroid does not affect its scarcity on this planet that we live on.\n\nThe interesting question is what it would cost, per ounce, to bring back the gold to earth.

Why would anyone mine for gold from the asteroids, when other precious metals in them have a lot more value, and bulk materials like fuel have even higher value than that?  Even if we wanted to extract the gold, current technology can't get it out.  Water and hydrocarbons for fuel can be extracted by simple heating to temperatures typical of a household oven (a few hundred degrees C).  Oven heating is easy, just use some mirrors to concentrate sunlight.\n\nPrecious metals, including gold, are mixed into chunks of asteroid steel in tiny quantities.  We don't know how to design an extraction process yet.

You might want to proof-read it, BTW; I spotted at least one type while browsing it ("is know" should be "is known"). Some remarks:\n\n1) Do not talk about "viruses" and "worms". The paper discusses a communication channel for command and control; you don\'t need self-replication for that. Besides, most self-replicating malware (i.e., viruses) doesn\'t use (or need) C&C communications. Talk about "malware" in general. You seem to mean mostly botnets anyway.\n\n2) As you note yourself in the paper, peer-to-peer C&C channels for malware already exist. You really should expand more on that. In particular, I don\'t see how a blockchain-based C&C communication (no matter whether the blockchain used by Bitcoin or any other blockain) is any better than the standard P2P model. After all, cryptocurrencies mostly use the P2P payment model anyway.\n\n3) Since the blockchain is public and most malware controllers do not want the commands they relay to their botnet to be publicly visible, you should write something that the information committed to the blockchain can (and should) be encrypted. Problem is, I don\'t see how this can be done in practice. OK, when the bot communicates with the controller, the information it sends can be encrypted, so that only the owner of the botnet can read it. But the commands sent by the owner to the botnet must be readable by the bots - and if they are encrypted with the public key of the bot, the bot will have to contain the secret key, which can be extracted by analyzing the bot, thus making the commands readable by anyone.': 7, "Sure, you can store data in OP_RETURN to act as command and control for malware.\n\nThe problem isn't bitcoin, the problem is the malware running on people's machines. \n\nAnd unless they want to airgap disconnect from the Internet, they will have to rebuild/restore then repair/patch/remediate/address vulnerabilties in their computers if they get infected with malware and want true system integrity back.\n\n": 6, 'The Bitcoin tip for 2 cents (57 bits/$0.02) has been collected by *crcondes*.\n\n\n[ChangeTip info](https://www.changetip.com/tip-online/reddit) | [ChangeTip video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AnfKpypMNw) | /r/Bitcoin': 1, 'The Bitcoin tip for 1 Kudos (5,725 bits/$2.00) has been collected by *needmoney90*.\n\n\n[ChangeTip info](https://www.changetip.com/tip-online/reddit) | [ChangeTip video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AnfKpypMNw) | /r/Bitcoin': 1, "That's not a bug, but a feature.

The velocity of money has no impact on the money supply. It *can* have an impact on prices, though, which are also impacted by the money supply, which might be the source of your confusion.\n\n2) When you deposit your money in a bank, you surrender your custody of them. Effectively, you lend them to the bank and become an unsecured creditor of that bank. The bank then uses this money as a fractional reserve to make loans 10 times increasing it. There is absolutely no reason why exactly the same scam cannot be performed with Bitcoin. Yes, the bank has the contractual obligation to return you the amount of money you have deposited (lent to it) - after some time and with some interest, depending on the terms of the contract. But it has absolutely no obligation to return you the very same banknotes you deposited.

It will simply be exactly the same kind of scam that it is now, in a fiat-based economy. Remember, the commercial banks cannot increase the base money - just as they cannot create new Bitcoins.
