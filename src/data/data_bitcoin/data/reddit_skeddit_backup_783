The problem is that these economies of scale are inconsistent with long-run competition.

And in summer it's a BBQ outside.\n\nSo, I can imagine that I as an individual have some use for the heat a miner makes and that spreads the units back out. \n\nSo I'm not 100% sure that things really do all come together under one control, even if we think there'll ultimately only be a couple big builders of mining equipment (like Intel and AMD are to CPUs).\n\nSeems pretty iffy.": 1, 'WTF is durham university': 2, 'this reminds me of the Wired article "Bitcoin is dead" in November 2011.. im so excited! this article is basically confirmation we are starting a bull run.': 12, "Haha wtf.

The reason this is not the current norm even though the [specification](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Getblocktemplate) "arguably" is not the problem is because miners don\'t demand it. They find it far more easy to switch pools when push comes to shove, and there are plenty of pools out there.\n\nAlso, if Bitcoin would go "bust" just because of this, there are things we can do to make pooled mining impossible. I don\'t think it would ever come to that though.\n\nRegarding mining itself, you have to make too many assumptions for my taste to call it a natural monopoly.\n\nJust as an example, heat concentration is a negative, and its cost grows nonlinearly with scale. You don\'t need any extra cooling system if you are running a couple of miners at home, and even make use of the heat (especially ideal if someone invents a water heater). And the additional risk has been demonstrated by the unfortunate fire today, destroying millions of dollars worth of equipment.\n\nOther examples include regulatory risk and the fact that electricity prices do not necessarily correlate with logistical cost.\n\nAll in all, I think this deserves extensive study.

IMO he's right, mining is a natural monopoly - two pools could always find some sort of tiny saving if they joined together, be that in admin or whatever.

That's in nobody's interests - particularly as the efficiency gains are going be pretty tiny.  And it has, I gather, proved relatively straightforward for mining pools to sort themselves out in the past to avoid this kind of thing.  It's not like this is a situation that hasn't arisen.\n\nIronically I (an economist) went through a period of finding out about bitcoin, often thinking I had worked something out (including this) that others hadn't seen because I was an economist and this is really economics.

Otherwise you have to pay a fee to convert to foreign currency (if they will let you transfer in the first place) that is where Bitcoin\'s true advantage is.

Good thing I back up to reddit, bitcointalk, my computer, and some other places.\n\n~~~\n\nHi.\n\nI\'m a Candidate for Individual Director of the Bitcoin Foundation. If you\'re curious, and I hope you are, you can find out some interesting things about me at [this link](https://bitcoin-election.consider.it/colin-gallagher), which contains bitcointalk, reddit, and foundation forum links with more in-depth information - choose your forum and interact with me more. \n\nI\'m looking forward to a multi-candidate AMA on reddit and hope we can do one of those well before the Feb. 13-19 elections, but will do my own AMA - let me know (here, reddit, wherever) when you would like to see that happen and what questions you have. I will respond to you within a day\'s time, I am checking the different fora (bitcointalk, reddit, here, etc.) So definitely feel free!\n\nMy (admittedly very basic) platform is:\n\nChoice for the users. Anything that does not provide or preserve user choice is a non-starter.\n\nBitcoin development.\n\nPrivacy and anonymity development using bitcoin. (I acknowledge that privacy and anonymity are two very different things, and I support the idea that the use of technologies that offer either should be a choice for end users ~ and I understand that the technical and development details of this cannot be whisked away by legislators, but that the details and the interface of technological progress and cultural progress must be honored as part of how our digital expression is evolving.) Support for open source initiatives that accomplish, or can help accomplish this goal in bitcoin and in any distributed-digital currency that is supported or funded by the Board and is determined to be within the ambit of the Corporation\'s purpose.\n\n\nAdditional details about what I support:\n\nListening to the users, as well as recognizing and including member and non-member input in the context of the Board\'s deliberations and decisions. Enhancing communication and supporting education about bitcoin. Greater transparency about what the Foundation is doing, through timely presentation of agendas before meetings and posting of minutes promptly thereafter. No-one should have to wait weeks or months to know what the Board does. No censorship here... We came to bitcoin tired of financial censorship in the regulated marketplaces. Now we are experiencing censorship in bitcoin communities, in fora, in "services." Listening and support yes, censorship and exclusion no.\n\nDecentralization, support for the Foundation in its present configuration as a recognized nonprofit, and support for proposals that would decentralize aspects of the Foundation, including support for use and development of systems that would enable the userbase to collectively make funding decisions (to complement Board votes and decisions relating to funding). Independence from regulatory efforts. Focusing on expanding support for solutions based in technology (bitcoin development, decentralized exchanges, anonymity solutions).\n\nInitiatives that reduce possible coercion while preserving or enhancing the users\' ability to voluntarily make decisions about their own resources. No-one should ever be coerced or forced to provide funds to any organization or effort that they do not support, regardless of whether or not an organization claims a basis in law for its extraction of resources from the users. Freedom to express ourselves as we wish across the blockchain.\n\nSince early November 2014 and coming out with this platform, I have stated that I will vote against any Foundation proposal that would result in initiation, continuance, or expansion of support for:  a.) Foundation lobbying (to Washington, D.C. or in any country where such lobbying activity would be proposed to extend to), b.) proposals to regulate bitcoin users or their identities, and c.) any effort, whether or not its proponents claim a basis in law, where evidence suggests that Foundation support for such an effort would result in user choice being impaired or limited.
