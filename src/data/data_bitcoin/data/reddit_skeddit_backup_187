But, like any new technology, the bank added that the hype cycle is building with no real legislative or regulatory framework.\n\n2 Space race heats up. To infinity and beyond? The space race is reigniting and Goldman said it sees investment opportunities. \xe2\x80\x9cAs the barrier and costs to deploying space technologies are lowered, we believe [aerospace and defense] companies will see accelerated growth in their space business lines, while commercial satellite operators may be disrupted by lower-cost alternatives,\xe2\x80\x9d wrote Goldman analyst Noah Poponak.\n\n\n3 Is college worth it? Amid rising costs and dismal wage growth, the average return on college is falling. Goldman said that, for the typical student, the number of years to break even on the cost of college has grown to nine today from eight in 2010. If current costs and wage growth persist, Goldman said students starting college in 2030 will have to wait 11 years post school to break even.\n\n\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s increasing unmet demand for specialized, or skilled, work. But Goldman said the labor market is moving faster than education, broadly speaking, can respond. Because of that, it sees \xe2\x80\x9cclear growth\xe2\x80\x9d opportunities in professional training programs via LinkedIn Corp.LNKD +0.86%, Coursera and edX.\n\n4 Tapping in to Gen Z. As the oldest Gen Z\xe2\x80\x99ers enter their mid- to late-teens, Goldman said this cohort will soon surpass Millenials in size and that their influence is already evident. The group is the most diverse to date, digital is at its core and it\xe2\x80\x99s decidedly financially conservative, according to Goldman analyst Christopher Wolf. \xe2\x80\x9cWhile not the first generation of youths with a desire to be heard, Gen-Z is arguably the first with the means,\xe2\x80\x9d he added.\n\n\n5 More flash crashes in store? Goldman said that while investors have become more used to greater volatility, the specter of another flash crash happening is top of mind for people. Recently, on Aug. 24, the stock market didn\xe2\x80\x99t fully open at 9:30 a.m. Eastern time as liquidity issues and selling pressure in the futures market spilled over into the stock market. When stocks did open, many securities traded off sharply and the largest number of Limit Up Limit Down trading halts to date were triggered.\n\n6 Lithium\xe2\x80\x99s increasing use. Take a look at Tesla Motors Inc.'sTSLA -1.00% stock over the past few years, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll see a lot of hype around battery-powered electric vehicles. Against this backdrop, Goldman said that the unique properties of lithium position it for portable energy storage applications that \xe2\x80\x9cwill be a key enabler of the electric car revolution and replace gasoline as the primary source of transportation fuel.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\nLithium is the earth\xe2\x80\x99s lightest solid element with double the energy density of the next closest alternative. It is one of the most abundant elements on earth too.\n\n7 Cancer\xe2\x80\x99s cure: the cloud? The last topic Goldman looks at is how the cloud has the potential to improve cancer treatment over the next decade. \xe2\x80\x9cRapid reductions in cloud storage costs and [better] DNA sequencing technology will soon merge with the proliferation of electronic medical records to enable a new paradigm in cancer treatment,\xe2\x80\x9d wrote Goldman analyst Isaac Ro.\n\n\nMr. Ro said the combination of lower cloud costs, improved DNA sequencing and the increase in electronic medical records should make it easier for physicians to analyze data and assess individual patient treatment options. For drug companies and scientists, it should cause them to develop drugs faster and cheaper. And for payers, the emergence of electronic medical records should help them better allocate health-care spend for both preventative and ongoing treatment-based applications.": 2}, ('A lesson for everyone...', 3): {'http://I.imgur.com/hybJVEN': 3, "I remember the only time I tried real gambling.\n\nMore than 10 years ago I put \xc2\xa310 into an online casino on a whim, I fancied trying the roulette.

However with SETLcoin you have to trust in \'whoever is swapping\'\n\nThis isn\'t a financial equivalence so you\'re double counting risk here -- you don\'t have to trust the swap counterparty in *either* case if you\'re willing to accept closing out with a digital good and not taking physical delivery/cash settlement. Bitcoin doesn\'t eliminate a level of trust there because in either case you still have to make another transaction between the digital good and the asset itself. However, Bitcoin does avoid the two-phase commit coordinator mechanism that Kaminska tears into.\n\nRelating to her comments on that, I think the nature of the two-phase commit role is interesting in the context of the idea that the primary goal of this might not be to build a fancy settlement platform for stocks or whatever, but to find a way to self-manage clearing and settling in the bilateral OTC market without technically violating Dodd-Frank regulation. I think that\'s what Kaminska hints at with the "cartel mechanism" comment at the end.': 2, ">SETLcoin won't hook you up with shoes either\n\nCorrect, you and Kaminska are in full agreement on this. This is the core premise of her article.\n\n>If you use a colored coin you don't have to trust Goldman Sucks or anyone else, with SETLcoin you do\n\nYou do need to trust whoever is swapping that colored coin with you for the actual asset you're acquiring if that asset isn't the actual (colored) BTC itself.

What happens if the trade happens with another entity? We are back to where we began. With Bitcoin, it doesn't matter who does the trade - anyone can be guaranteed of its validity. ": 2, "How much is a SETLcoin worth?  If it doesn't have market value, then it has to be backed by something or someone, which introduces counterparty risk.  Bitcoin isn't backed by anything per say, however it is currently worth about $380 a coin depending on liquidity.  That's the advantage that bitcoin has over these private blockchain coins.  \n\nIt sounds like SETLcoin is a GS IOU.  \n\nThe best way that these banks can swap assets is for each bank to create digital shares of their corporate stock and use those as IOUs for various other purchases.  As least those would have a relative market value.  \n": 1, "SETLcoin isn't meant to be an asset onto itself.

Izabella.': 5, "It seems to me you could operate a coin on a consortium of a large number of banks internationally, a bit like SWIFT, ~~so you're in proper Byzantine Generals territory, and you could use PoW but limited to those fixed players.~~\n\nEdit: No, I forgot again - with fixed identities you can just  use signatures, no need for PoW mining.\n\nBottom line is when you have identities you have a very different kind of system - it can be fast and efficient but it can never be censorship resistant (at least, not fully).": 1, "They hate it so much because it's threatening to them- either their livelihood or their beliefs.

': 0, 'No I actually think they\'re in agreement on this, Derman clarifies that he\'s considering Bitcoin to be the product for which \n\n>the trade IS the settlement.\n\nThat is, the transactions denominated in block reward tokens "instantly" settle when a trade is confirmed. The issue that Kaminska\'s article covers is the reliance of the settlement parties on a trusted exchange mechanism between SETLcoin and the securities that actually matter. So I don\'t think the shoe analogy is a bad one -- if I don\'t care about receiving a (colored) BTC token but I do care about receiving the shoes that the token represents, then regardless of how many times the transaction has been confirmed by bitcoin miners, the shoe trade hasn\'t really settled until somebody hands me the shoes. So I think Derman is indirectly pointing out that the only thing that bitcoin miners are capable of "instantly" confirming (with the intended level of security, decentralization etc.) is a Bitcoin transaction itself; actually using that transaction to settle a trade in another asset requires another layer (Counterparty, sidechains, etc.) which carries additional risk.': 2, "<raises hand> Umm, hi, I'm with Citibank... can I show you a few slides?": 3, "But...but... but everyone keeps telling me that banks will have no problem succeeding with their own private version of Bitcoin because... because they're banks, and really smart, and rich, and stuff!": 2, "Yes, thats most likely.

What the pools I've talked to are doing is using compression methods to only send the transactions that are not in the other node's mempool to communicate blocks across the Great Firewall. My proposal gives about 1 kB transfers across the GFW per block in the latency critical path, while continuing to fully validate, regardless of the block size, and it means that the rest of the world gets blocks at essentially the same time as China does (which means no accidental selfish mining attacks).

I am suggesting using the stratum protocol as a block compression method, not as a validation-free mining method. In fact, the use of stratum that I am suggesting makes full validation easier and less expensive. The purpose of my proposal is to allow the coinbase transaction to be determined by nodes in China (where all revenue-critical systems should be done for security reasons), while block assembly and validation can be done in regions with faster internet (so as to not disadvantage non-Chinese miners and perform accidental selfish mining attacks).\n\nThe only risk that I can think of is that someone will take over the VPSs or colocated servers in foreign datacenters and use these nodes to intentionally mine invalid blocks for SPV double-spend attacks, or will include valid but undesirable transactions like double-spends. These attacks will be detectable after a few seconds (we can send the full transaction data to China on a channel that is not used in the latency-critical path in order to allow block publishing to happen simultaneously inside and outside China under most circumstances), and they\'re basically the same risk as running any pool server in a datacenter instead of in your own home or office.\n\nI think the objections that have been raised about this issue come from people misunderstanding what I\'m proposing. They hear the word "stratum" and think it means validation-free, but the truth is that 99.9% of all mining (including fully validating mining) uses stratum. I\'m just suggesting using stratum a little differently than it has been used so far. The use I am suggesting is a fully-validating one.': 3, "Well, this goes in the line of Szabo's argument though: If they do not trust the VPS in Tokyo for the coinbase transaction, they should not trust him either for the rest of transactions (i.e., they could be building invalid blocks or, more subtly, attacking BetCoinDice or applying redlists).\n\nHonestly, if the Great Firewall is such an obstacle and 60% of the hashing power is on the Chinese side, then it is the rest of the world -not China- who is in trouble.\n\nIn other words, it is you who should build a stratum bridge to a Chinese VPS inside the Firewall that talks directly to the Chinese majority of the hashing power.": 1, "> https://twitter.com/zooko/status/673373001019031552\n\nMy proposal has nothing to do with validation free mining. It would actually be fully validating, and would make the cost of full validation easier. The point of using stratum in this way is to move block creation and block validation out of China while still controlling the coinbase transaction (with its 25 BTC reward) in China (for Chinese pools). This gets rid of basically all of the performance problems of the Great Firewall and the consequent accidental selfish mining risk while having very low additional security risk. Basically, it just means that you have block creation and validation being done in a commercial datacenter on a VPS or dedicated server in a hosting environment instead of in your own office. I don't see how that can be used in an economically meaningful attack, but if you do, please let me know how.\n\nIt seems I'll need to have a conversation with Peter Todd and /u/adam3us about this, as it seems a few Core developers misunderstood my proposal.

Or perhaps every miner responds by filling blocks as a defensive measure, and we have a big problem on our hands.\n\nA 1MB max block size might not be large enough for that attack to make a difference, but 8MB might be plenty. \n\n\n': 3, 'I don\'t understand the word "democratic" when the only folks who can vote are the miners.

You can only access it during business hours though as it\'s inside the outer doors of a corporate office building. The guy who manages it is only a few floors up in case something wouldn\'t work properly or you\'d want to ask for help on how to use it or how to store and handle "real" bitcoin properly. He or one of his employees are usually there and at least the manager loves to talk about bitcoin.\n\nAlso, you could visit the local meetup group called "Stockholm Satoshi Square". They meet on Mondays in "Kulturhuset" on the bottom floor in a restaurant / cafe area:\n\nhttp://www.meetup.com/stockholm-satoshi-square/\n\nI\'ve attended their meetups a couple of times, and they\'re both friendly and helpful to people who know just a little but are interested in learning more. They also trade bitcoin to and from cash directly from their cell phones. If you chose to buy from them, be sure to ask loudly enough so everyone at the table can hear you (but not loud enough so that the cafe staff or the whole restaurant can hear you): "Is there anyone who can make a better offer than 392 USD / bitcoin?", and watch their reactions. People don\'t usually do that and accept the first person\'s offer, but I saw a guy ask a similar question, and yes, he did get a slightly better deal from a guy a few chairs away from him.\n\nBe sure to know how to calculate a reasonable price in SEK, so you don\'t have to blindly trust your seller when he offers you an exchange rate. I\'ve never seen anyone get tricked, but you don\'t want to be the first. There is no "membership" to be allowed to be there, so anyone can show up at those meetups.\n\nUsually there are only 2-3 people who have registered themselves as attending, but 5-7 people appear there anyway. People are just lazy to register that they\'re coming on the meetup site, so there will be enough people to keep interesting conversations going, sometimes even several at a time.\n\nBefore you visit either the ATM (just a few blocks away from Kulturhuset) or the meetup, I\'d recommend that you download and install either the Mycelium bitcoin wallet app if you\'re on Android, or the Breadwallet app if you\'re on Iphone. Play around a little so that you can have more than just a few questions before you meet the people.\n\nEveryone can see everyone in the open restaurant / cafe and it\'s right across "Plattan" where a lot of weirdos hang around.

So I\'d recommend to not bring too much cash with you the first couple of times, just to get a feeling of the situation, the people and your surroundings. You shouldn\'t even trust me in anything I say.
