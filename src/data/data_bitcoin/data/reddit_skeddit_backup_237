Banks are creating money and THEN it comes back as deposits. Only the money creation leads to economic activity, not the deposit. The concepts of "banks lending deposits" or "banks multiplying capital" are simply an illusion. There is empirical evidence for that:\n\n*Abstract*\n\n*This paper presents the first empirical evidence in the history of banking on the question of whether banks can create money out of nothing. The banking crisis has revived interest in this issue, but it had remained unsettled. Three hypotheses are recognised in the literature. According to the financial intermediation theory of banking, banks are merely intermediaries like other non-bank financial institutions, collecting deposits that are then lent out. According to the fractional reserve theory of banking, individual banks are mere financial intermediaries that cannot create money, but collectively they end up creating money through systemic interaction. A third theory maintains that each individual bank has the power to create money \xe2\x80\x98out of nothing\xe2\x80\x99 and does so when it extends credit (the credit creation theory of banking). The question which of the theories is correct has far-reaching implications for research and policy. Surprisingly, despite the longstanding controversy, until now no empirical study has tested the theories. This is the contribution of the present paper. An empirical test is conducted, whereby money is borrowed from a cooperating bank, while its internal records are being monitored, to establish whether in the process of making the loan available to the borrower, the bank transfers these funds from other accounts within or outside the bank, or whether they are newly created. This study establishes for the first time empirically that banks individually create money out of nothing. The money supply is created as \xe2\x80\x98fairy dust\xe2\x80\x99 produced by the banks individually, "out of thin air".*\n\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1057521914001070': 3, 'By a bitcoin only system I actually mean an aconomy that only uses bitcoin some point from now.

Now then, there are two possibilities for bitcoin, 1) bitcoin won't change, or 2) it will change. \n\nIf 1) is the right answer the situation will be no different from today, so why would the value go down? Alts with different rules are here now, and bitcoin has a low limit. We only avg what, about 500kb to 700kb a block anyway, so we have excess room for usage to go up even, if bitcoin didn't change. If 2) is the correct answer and bitcoin changes its block size limit, then most agree the value will increase.  Either choice the price doesn't necessarily collapse, and probably won't. In fact it could create more incentive to mine because txn fees must increase. \n\nBy my last question I was trying to pull out the realization that there are equally important benefits of bitcoin over alts other than scalability. The fact that it's the largest most secure network, most widely and highly  valued cryotocurrency, and the network effects it enjoys points to a logical conclusion that even if it didn't increase its block size, the 3-7 txns/sec will still be highly valued for those other characteristics. It could become used for high value, low liquidity txns for example.\n\nYou may be correct in believing that the TPS limit goes up, but you get to that conclusion falsely it seems.": 1, 'Exactly. If Bitcoin has no real-world utility, it will be of little interest for investors.\n\nE.g. if Monero or another altcoin with otherwise similar properties as Bitcoin (e.g. Litecoin, Vertcoin) have more TPS capacity and Bitcoin stubburnly/ideologically stays at 3 TPS, then eco-system will change to those other crypto-currencies for REAL WORLD USE, and as a result, also investors will change.

Otherwise we're just wasting our time here. You can't try to offer an alternative that's inferior to the status quo.\n\nCan't wait for scalability to be solved, otherwise we just have a proof of concept and nothing more.": 1, 'The point you miss is that Bitcoin is *not* supposed to be purely some sort of Visa replacement. It is, first and foremost a **cryptocurrency**, a censorship-resistant store of value (i.e. digital \'gold\', or electronic \'cash\' as Satoshi describes it) that provides monetary sovereignty (private money, rather than public money connected to any particular government). Have you forgotten this? Your post seems to completely forget this aspect.\n\nPeople say we need to follow Satoshi, but Satoshi cited central banking\'s failure and bailing out of banks (i.e. failure of fiat, *not* failure of Visa), as his motive to create Bitcoin. Satoshi also wanted to create a "purely peer to peer electronic cash". Bitcoin has not been designed for banks to use it as their tool to move fiat. I mean, really, who cares what systems banks use, how does that *really* matter? It\'s nice if utility can be maximized and more functions possible, but that was not the primary reason why Satoshi created it.\n\nThis doesn\'t mean we shouldn\'t also try to scale Bitcoin, but it has to be done carefully. It doesn\'t seem you understand the importance of doing it \'carefully\', based on this statement: *"I doubt this architectural change will ever happen if we can\xe2\x80\x99t even agree on a simple algorithm to raise blocksize"*. It\'s not a "simple algorithm"; if it was, we would not have so much debate. It has to be considered in a way that keeps the network decentralized.\n\nThe point of things like Lightning Network is also to allow "real" scalability on the order of 10,000x (as you mentioned in the post, block size isn\'t really going to solve the problem in a significant way), while also keeping the network decentralized.\n\nSee BitFury\'s recent statement on Lightning:\n\n* https://twitter.com/BitfuryGeorge/status/663432401645797376 ("enter lightning 10000X Visa coming up.")\n\nWith respect to OpenBazaar, OB is not interested in providing privacy to its users: no Tor, no nothing... so I wonder how much value they will bring, if they are already compromising on principles, in order to appease mainstream.\n\nBut back to the issue of how it will handle Bitcoin not being scalable, that\'s a good question. I imagine Lightning will have to play a major role. If Lightning is estimated to take another 12 months to be rolled out, and we couple it with a stop-gap blocksize increase (a 2-4-8 MB plan over 4 yrs has been mentioned a lot -- and even those numbers are not set in stone for the purpose of debate) in the mean time, then maybe such a combo will do the job.\n\nWe are at 50% block capacity right now on average, so doubling capacity in the next 3 months (to 2 MB) will put us at 25% of capacity. Based on Tradeblock\'s analysis of trends, this means we would rise to about 40% of capacity by July 2016. By then, we should be able to expect Lightning\'s arrival, which will at the very least help offload those transactions of small value (small value, because it won\'t be secure enough to handle large value transactions until longer-term malleability soft forks are deployed) from on-chain to LN.\n\nI\'m not sure what percentage of transactions are of \'small value\', but I imagine it\'s a sizable number (anyone have statistics?). So, we can estimate for the sake of argument that maybe, assuming 50% of transactions are viable to be transacted over LN instead, we will then be utilizing 20% of capacity (or lower!) with the advent of LN. Placed on such a trajectory, we would then double block size to 4 MB in 1.5 yrs (early 2018), and double again to 8 MB 2 yrs later.\n\nThese are just attempted estimates.\n\nLet\'s wait for Scaling Bitcoin #2 in Hong Kong to see what scaling proposals people announce and the specific numbers.': 8, 'Key word of Satoshi\'s paper:\n> "**purely peer-to-peer** version of electronic **cash**"\n\nI already argued this point, saying bitcoin is a cryptocurrency and \'digital cash/gold\'. The point is monetary sovereignty. Building a better Visa is really boring, and misses the point that Bitcoin is not merely a value transfer network. First and foremost, it is digital gold. This is the only reason bitcoin has value at $322, and is not currently at $50 or something. You should watch a video of what Wences of Xapo has to say, as well as Szabo\'s recent talks. Also, this is not possible unless, as Satoshi said, it\'s "purely peer-to-peer", aka decentralized & trust-minimized & censorship-resistant.\n\nAs for scalability being solved, a good method (aka, decentralized & scaling by factor of 10,000x or more) is via Lightning.': 2, "I'll just leave this here...\n\n** hides behind desk with a helmet on **": 1, "got so many questions for lightning and an actual working implementation, in my experience with p2p what they describe will bring more headaches than solutions, too much complexity, and seems like an opportunity for big companies to bring more centralization, also doesn't cover all use cases for bitcoin, unless you manage to convince everyone to use lightning and you trust your balance to a lightning service/federation of lightning servers. and how much will it cost to keep your money there? ": 1, "Tokens are generated by bankers, the same way they generate electronic tokens today to represent the account balance on your checking account. If they have the power to do that today, they should have the power to move the existing value represented in today's account into that blockchain.\n\nOnce a token is created and moved around the blockchain it can always be tracked to the moment it was added to the chain.\n\nAnd yes, read the post again, I'm moving trust back into banks, or you think banks are going to just let go of the power they have as centralized trust entities?\n\nI'm just making a case that if banks got their shit together and gave us blockchain capabilities to openly transact, while keeping trust in their hands, people would dismiss Bitcoin as it would be an inferior option.\n\nIf Bitcoin gets to scale, then that's another story and the next issues to solve are volatility, fungibility and regulation.": 1, "Don't you think Lightning is actually detrimental to mining incentives.\n\nAs you have less rewards per block and as you have more people transacting on blocks that are becoming full, you will be tempted to move most transactions off-chain with lightning, which means less fees for miners, then miners will instead want to run lightning nodes and will have to charge you for opening channels to keep those servers up.\n\nOB at this point is interested in having a working product. I'm sure those interested in adding layers of privacy will be able to do so. Hopefully with something better than government's Tor. I2P would make more sense IMO as OB uses a lot of UDP.\n\nI understand the motivation for decentralization, but my point is that people will not care about much of that if they got to see what banks could be capable off if they actually tried to offer what Bitcoin can already do for us today.\n\nAs for the changes on architecture, I left a link on that phrase, I wasn't refering to LN, I was referring to this http://blog.sldx.com/three-challenges-for-scaling-bitcoin/\n\n\n": 2, "Does this blockchain have native tokens?  Do these tokens have a value?  If so how?   Are these tokens backed by bankers willingness to accept them in exchange for fiat? or something else, like gold, silver, oil? etc?  \n\nHow do bankers create a new token that has market value with NO counterparty risk and is zero trust, like bitcoin?  \n\nIf they can't create this, then they have a fancy settlement system for IOUs and everything is based on trust again.  Which means that the whole system can come crashing down again when they can not prove their reserves.\n\n\nI made a post about this topic the other day.   \n\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3qtvlp/the_economist_youre_getting_it_wrong/cwihhh5?context=3\n\nIMO, everyone is focusing on the Bitcoin network, when they should be focusing on the settlement free asset, that is bitcoin.": 5, 'BitFury supports Lightning, so I doubt it.

": 1}, ('What would banking and finance look like in a Bitcoin economy?', 2): {'>Additionally, banks could only lend real amounts of bitcoin instead of fractional reserve banking which would really slow our economy\n\nThere are two conceptual mistakes here. Let\'s look at the first one...\n\n> banks could only lend real amounts of bitcoin instead of fractional reserve banking\n\nFRB existed even during the time of commodity money. Basically, banks issue IOUs for gold (or Bitcoin). These IOUs don\'t need to be backed by actual deposits, because banks know not all their depositors are going to withdraw at the same time.\n\nNow, Bitcoin is a free market currency. There is no government forcing people to accept it, unlike fiat money (refer to any dollar bills in your wallet - "this note is legal tender for all debts public and private"). If people aren\'t forced to accept Bitcoin itself, let alone a bank-issued Bitcoin IOU. It is an open question whether FRB would be accepted by the market at all; if it is, reserves would likely be much closer to 100% than they are today. They would be kept like that by the fear of a bank run.\n\n> [closert-to-full reserve banking] would really slow our economy\n\nAlso incorrect. There are two types of investments: good, profitable ones and bad ones. This is measured by profitability, *net of market interest rates*. The higher (or full) banking reserves would mean the real interest rates would probably be higher than they are today. This means, and you were probably thinking of that when you said the economy would slow down, that many investments which nowadays happen wouldn\'t happen in a cryptocurrency economy.\n\nHowever, this is a good thing. Let\'s take a look at what interest rates are. They are a reflection of the fact that, in order to lend you money today, I want a higher sum when you pay me back. This *time preference* is what gives rise to interest. The market interest rate is determined by the combined time preference of all the actors in the economy - both lenders with more cash than they can profitably utilize at the present, and borrowers with greater need for cash than they currently have (mostly entrepreneurs).\n\nNow, as we have seen, good investments are profitable, even net of market interest rates. However, fiat currency and central banking lower the interest rates below market rates (some stupid countries are even experimenting with negative nominal rates, and many already have negative real rates). This means *malinvestment* can occur - investment whose returns are higher than current interest rates, but lower than market rates. This investment is such that the economy would be better off if it weren\'t carried out. It creates no wealth, and rather destroys it. People get poorer because of it. They are a waste of scarce resources.\n\nAnd you recognize it yourself:\n\n> make it more stable presumably\n\nThe "instability" you\'re referring to are the recessions and depressions caused by central banking and its consequent malinvestment. While there\'s an initial apparent boom, the competition for capital goods created by these wasteful projects eventually rises the cost of capital goods for good projects as well. This triggers the crises you see. A malinvestment-free economy, one where the current interest rate dynamically matches the market rate (i.e. that derived from individuals\' time preferences), would see no such boom and bust cycles. Only continuous, long-lasting prosperity.': 2, "Well fractional reserve banking simply allows way more spending in the economy which makes the economy faster in the now, but unstable in the future. Fractional reserve banking may speed the economy up, but I don't think this is a solution, I agree that it's a problem. I think if our debt was financed by the real amount of money or bitcoins then the economy will slow down, but at least be real. If the economy is actually realistic, it'll be more stable and robust.": 1, "I think it's more likely that robo-investors will make MANY small investments per small investor so that even we little folk can get the benefit of a highly diversified portfolio?\n\nNeed a loan?

If you default, they all get hurt a tiny bit, but nobody is broken.\n\nI find it a bit shocking to see you believe that fractional reserve banking is somehow responsible for the fast pace of the world economy. It may have been in the past -- running up debt is always exhilarating -- but looking back I think it's been more of a problem than a solution...": 2, 'I\'m not certain the economy would slow down, particularly from this starting point...\n\nHow does an economy react with an "ideal" currency? We\'ve certainly never had one before...\n\nI suspect interest rates would be very high. While you might think this would slow things down, only people confident in the outcome would borrow.\n\nAnd the people lending -- and with Bitcoin everyone could afford to lend something -- would have high income.\n\nOn second thought, since everyone can lend something, billions of active lenders might drive interest rates lower than the average we\'ve grown accustomed to...\n\nAnd, when someone kills it like Apple has -- and ends up making profits faster than they can spend it -- everyone else holding Bitcoin would become wealthy as well as that would make currency artificially more scarce.': 2, '\n**The End of Banking: Money, Credit, and the Digital Revolution** \n\n||||\n--:|:--|:--\nCurrent|$15.95|Amazon (New)\nHigh|$15.95|Amazon (New)\nLow|$14.25|Amazon (New)\n|Average|$15.95|30 Day\n\n[Price History Chart and Sales Rank](http://i.imgur.com/xGbIIpR.png) | [FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/r/PriceZombie/wiki/index) \n': 1, '"The End of Banking" by McMillan <http://www.amazon.com/End-Banking-Credit-Digital-Revolution/dp/3952438510/> is the definitive study on how the many functions accumulated into traditional "banking" will be transformed or eliminated as the digital age unfolds.
