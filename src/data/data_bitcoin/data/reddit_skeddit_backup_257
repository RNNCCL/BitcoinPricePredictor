So A chooses the route A->B->C->D->E and is the only one to know it.\n\nLet\'s say that hubs B, C, D are identified by their public key pubB, pubC, pubD.\n\nA generates three key pairs: pairB, pairC, pairD, one for each node. It then does three Diffie Hellman key exchanges:\n\n* pairB.priv + pubB = sB\n* pairC.priv + pubC = sC\n* pairD.priv + pubD = sD\n\nBasically sB, sC and sD are secret keys shared between A and each one of the hubs. Each hub will be able to recompute this key by doing the same operation using their private key and pairX.pub. \n\nA then build the following three messages:\n\n* "please forward this to C" = msgB\n* "please forward this to D" = msgC\n* "please forward this to E" = msgD\n\nNow is the tricky part:\n\n1) A ciphers msgD with sD resulting in ciphD\n\n2) A ciphers pairD.pub+ciphD+msgC with sC resulting in ciphC\n\n3) A ciphers pairC.pub+ciphC+msgB with sB resulting in ciphB\n\nThen A send pairB.pub+ciphB to B.\n\nUsing pairB.pub and its private key, B will find sB, which it will use to uncipher ciphB resulting in pairC.pub+ciphC+msgB. After reading msgB, it will know that it needs to forward pairC.pub+ciphC (which is unreadable to B) to C. C and D do the same: each hub "peels the onion".\n\nWhat\'s important is that:\n\n- with appropriate padding (omitted here for brevity), messages between each participant will always be of exactly the same size.\n- the buffer is built in a circular fashion (padding prepended, actual message at the end), so that each node has no idea where it sits in the route\n- since everybody is a hub, B has no way to know that A was the initiator, and D does not know either that E is the final payee\n\nBasically that\'s how it works for now.

Forget needing to make payments through middle men. It's not even necessary to involve one's bank to make a **bit coin** transaction happen. Aside from being a type of Internet currency, **bit coin** is not vulnerable to the usual bank practices of currency manipulation. Rather, specialized coding procedures are used to ensure the stability of **bit coin** and prevent these manipulations from occurring. Now anyone can use this decentralized currency. All that a person needs to get started is a computer or similar smart device that can access the Internet.\n\nWhy use **bit coin** instead of other conventional payment options?\n\n* The unique coding method, called a block chain, employed in a bit coin transaction makes it next to impossible for third party entities to hack into and follow your transactions.

Incentivize creation of Takers -- Send every transaction as a CoinJoin. ; Rationale: Much improved privacy, at very low cost, automatically ; Cost example: Sending $10 = 0.01%*10 = 0.001 ; To send $10, it costs 1/10 of 1 cent. To send a CoinJoin via 10 parties, assuming it then costs 1/10 of 1 cent * 10 = 1 cent. // Paying 1 cent to send $10 (or 0.1% fee) properly anonymized (assuming 10 parties qualifies) sounds amazing, although it could get irritating as you send higher amounts, because CoinJoin fee is variable (%-based), while bitcoin tx fee is fixed. So, the optimal # of CoinJoin parties (after factoring in diminishing returns) should be determined, to minimize cost. Also, hopefully greater usage (including usage via mixing with more parties rather than less), and ease of use to be a maker, should keep costs down?\n\n2. Incentivize creation of Makers -- Yield generator is essential, because it ensures ease of use for people to contribute back to the network and ensure a greater anonymity set. It's not just about investment and making profit. JoinMarket needs both: makers + takers.\n\nIf #1 can be guaranteed to work well in all cases, then maybe being able to do a manual 1-time CoinJoin would be unnecessary and redundant.

It seemed to me that you had not actually used Electrum, and were merely speculating.\n\nI agree that the software could be improved by making it non-copypastable. You should file an issue on their Github repo, as with this link: https://github.com/spesmilo/electrum/issues': -1, "> [...] so you would have to deliberately disregard the program's advice about storing the seed.\n>\n> Can't say I feel bad for the user who lost his bitcoins.\n\nSort of arrogant top-down attitude, don't you think? Also to the upvoters, I think they did not think about it properly.\n\nInstead of blaming the user (you will never succeed educating all users, as little as you succeed to convince the dumb masses to use vi editor or the command line, which is more efficient then clicking 20 times, but still users will prefer the clumsy GUI), we should strive to design the software such that it is safe against user mis-behaviour.\n\nIn this particular case it is simple: DISABLE copy-pasting the mnemonic seed word list. Instead show an image or something with the word-list (something not copy-able). Then force the user to write it on paper. Then force the user to validate by re-typing from paper - like in mycelium (have a look there - program supports with text-auto-completion as the user types the words from the word list for user convenience, so it is least annoying!). If the user skips this manual validation, either do not proceed with the program at all, or always show a very annoying nag-screen warning (like mycelium). As soon as the wallet balance exceeds <tbd> EUR (in bitcoin), program shall re-insist in validating the seed before continuing... there are so many possibilities - display reminders with test-questions, display another screen with another question about how the user has made the backup. Do it in an annoying way! It really makes sense to think in this direction. Because in the end, the program should behave to the user like a parent behaves to an inexperienced child: Would the parents let the child leave the house bare-feet in winter? No! It might seem annoying to the impatient child to wait and put on shoes, but the parents know it is better for the child to put on shoes!\n\nSame with backing up the seed: The program should educate the inexperienced user in a friendly-forcefully manner. The program knows better what is good to the user, so it can and should be programmed like that! Eventually, the user (child) will be grateful that the program (parents) behaved like that and forced him to act responsibly.\n\n*EDIT: Since Electrum is conceptually EXCELLENT otherwise, I have good hopes that this conceptual gap will be closed at some point in the not too distant future.*": 4, '> Low-S values are used in signatures (BIP 62).\n\nWow, this is crazy late.
