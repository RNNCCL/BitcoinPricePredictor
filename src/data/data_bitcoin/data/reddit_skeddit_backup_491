But we are talking **storage** here - you wouldn't keep $200k in fiat in your wallet, likewise no-one in their right mind is going to carry 1000 BTC around for day to day spending, so for that you need a secure storage medium that is going to protect the keys long term. \n\n> bad for privacy.\n\nThat is a totally different conversation, and not what the OP was after.\n\nWhen you are talking a quarter million dollars worth of coins, it pays to be extra paranoid and protect as much as possible against a range of reasons why you might lose your private keys. \n\n- Online wallets (coins kept on exchanges and the like) are completely vulnerable to theft, hacking, company collapse etc.. These should never be used for anything other than temporary storage. \n\n- Other online wallets (private keys generated by online web sites etc.) are vulnerable to viruses, trojans, cache attacks and the like, as well as network snooping. As others have pointed out, even HTTPS and TOR will not help you here, offline generation of keys is the only truly safe way.\n\n- PC/Mobile and other hot wallets are all susceptible to theft; either via hacking, network snooping, trojans, viruses, or plain old physical theft. But also susceptible to hardware failure (ie. hard disk crash) or destruction. Even USB key backups aren't completely safe. These wallets are only good for storage of small amounts of spending money, just like a regular fiat wallet is. \n\n- Hardware cold wallets are great and all, but (correct me if I am wrong) are still susceptible to firmware attacks, oscilloscope hacks, as well as hardware failure by electrical, magnetic, water or fire damage. The device can also be simply stolen, smashed or lost, your coins might stay secure but if you can't get them what is the point. \n\n- [Brain wallets](https://www.bitaddress.org) as I mentioned above are all good and fine until you suffer a stroke and forget the passphrase, not good for long term storage, but great for smuggling coins across borders safely if it ever comes to that.  \n\nWhich basically just leaves paper wallets. \n\n1. First they are safe from snooping or hacking, viruses, trojans, network sniffing and all other forms of electronic attack. The best (and only truly secure) way to create them is to do so from a completely 'off the grid' computer that is not connected to any network, is running a clean/fresh OS (such as Linux from a bootable CD) and running the website files via local files only. Then when you print them off, do so only on a completely non-network connected printer. Create them this way and there is zero chance anyone can get to the private keys without physical access to the PC at the exact time they are being created. [Details about this are here](https://bitcoinpaperwallet.com/#security).\n\n2. You can print multiple copies of each paper wallet, so as to allow an offsite backup copy for emergencies. If your primary storage location burns down, is flooded, blows up in a gas explosion, is robbed, etc. the backups at your secondary location will still let you get your coins safely out. \n\n3. BIP38 encryption of the wallets ensures that if a wallet does get stolen, without the password the thief will not be able to get the coins, and the backups will allow you to safely empty the wallets to move the coins out to new locations.\n\n4. To protect against physical damage, you have the backups, but what if a mass disaster happens and there is a tidal wave and your whole town get's flooded or a huge fire burns down half the neighborhood? Sure this stuff is unlikely to happen to you but it does happen, so it is reasonable to take basic steps to allow for this. Simple precautions against water damage are called for. This means at the least a) using a laser printer and most definitely not an ink jet, a single drop of water will destroy an ink jet print in seconds. b) putting the wallets in zip lock bags. The waterproof/heat resistant paper I linked to above adds an additional level of security here by making the paper so much harder to be destroyed. Finally, as a simple protection against fire damage, keeping all your wallets in a fireproof bag (and ideally storing them in a secure safety deposit box, or a fireproof safe) is a cheap and simple precaution.  \n": 1, 'What happens when your offline laptop dies?': 1, "I don't think I'd sign so many offline transactions before I'd upgrade.

How does bitpay plan on making money?   1-2 million a year processing transactions doesnt cover their payroll. They need to increase their business by a factor of 10, yet it only went up by 50% YOY, that's not VC early stage growth rates, that's late stage after IPO.\n\n2. If you believe Bitpay is 50% of the merchant processing market, that means roughly $300 million in Bitcoin commerce sales, while we spend $300 million on security.  Sure it doesn't cover black market, investment holders etc.  But something has to move, either the network is over secured or Bitcoin is about to experience explosive growth.  Reality is probably in the middle.\n\n3. Bitcoin is tool of the white elite.  $25 million on precious metals, and $76 million on mining hardware.  There is no real consumer volume.\n\nI think this places on hold the meme of Bitcoin as payment tool.  It's not.": 21, 'Scroll down a bit. It says that 28.6k BTC has been kept in coins. $87.7M to USD converted and $37,3M to Euro.': 6, 'If we start to see a trend over the next couple of years of Bitcoin companies winding down due to slowed growth the sector is probably in big trouble. Things need to start growing again or the VCs are just going to close the tap.': 2, "Even if they charge as much as credit card companies do for small time users, they're looking at $4mn/year tops by their own numbers.\n\nIf they're taking in *more* than that, then merchants are coming out behind over credit cards.": 1, 'activate everything !\nThe satoshkey universal crypto currency switches can be activated through bitcoin payments.\n\nhttp://satoshkey.com/': 0, 'I\'ve always seen Bitpay and the merchants they sign on as mostly a release valve for the steam produced during bubbles. As the price rises and people inevitably want to convert bitcoin to fiat in order to rebalance their portfolio (take profits on the investment gains), since exchanges are still difficult and people are feeling rich, they can skip several steps by buying whatever they need through Bitcoin-enabled merchants. That enables a partial skipping of dealing with exchanges.\n\nSince Bitcoin has risen a lot since its inception and will need to rise a lot more in order to be successful, and since exchanges are likely to continue to be a friction point for quite some time, Bitpay seems a moderately viable play on Bitcoin\'s value. Though since it doesn\'t seem to be a very leveraged play I\'m not sure there\'s that much point to it as venture investment.\n\nIn short, I think Bitpay\'s main competitors are the exchanges. They\'re a minor help in reducing friction in that way, but I think they are part and parcel of the very premature push for merchant adoption and "Bitcoin is a currency!" idea, which is also jumping the gun. Bitcoin, being a tool for getting around things, will first be useful where there are things to be got around. The bigger and more formidable the obstacles to commerce in a given area, the more Bitcoin can be useful. Bitcoin adoption will continue to happen organically at the margins, driven by pressing need, not minor convenience. Meanwhile, investment drives up the price, though in humongous fits and starts ( spectacular rises and drops on a net upward path, if it is to succeed), to make future ubiquity more and more likely. ': 1, "Nice visual, but Bitcoin isn't moving to a currency yet as it claims near the top. The lower average payment figures are more likely due to bitcoiners being less rich right now.

In general if someone wants to unload BTC they'd be wise to first look for purchases they were going to make anyways, rather than sell on exchange, wait for wire transfer, pay with credit card, then pay the credit card with a check. If you already have bitcoins burning a hole in your pocket, spending makes a lot of sense - but if there's nothing available that you want, you sell on exchange instead. In that case merchant adoption just broadens the scope of when that dynamic applies.\n\nSo at least some, if not most, of the notion that merchant adoption creates selling pressure is a myth, based on missing the unseen: the bitcoins that would be sold directly if they weren't able to be spent.": 1, "> This is VC bubble land, you don't need to make money, you just need to grow and get more VC money!\n\nThe problem is that the growth numbers aren't going to attract another strong round of VC funding.

I had read in the lesson plan ahead of time that we would be experimenting with how much electricity would cause how much light and heat in an ordinary light bulb, so I thought now would be a good time to bring my temperature measuring device just to be able to verify our theoretical temperature calculations. There was no mention about trying to actually measure the temperature inside the light bulb in the lesson plan, just trying to calculate it with the help from other measured data.\n\nHis jaw dropped when he saw me use my temperature measuring device (we were not supposed to use them, and the school didn\'t have any of their own. We were only supposed to measure the amount of light and electricity and then learn about the temperature from calculating it, not by measuring it.). When I saw his shocked facial expression I immediately thought "Oh, shit, now he\'s probably thinking that I\'m trying to cheat by not doing my calculations". But he just asked me discreetly "how could you afford to buy such a device?". I said that they are sold for about 100 USD in a local electronics shop. \n\nHe said "Wow, just a few decades ago they cost thousands of dollars and were much heavier and larger and were certainly not sold in ordinary hardware shops. May I play with it?". "Of course", I said. "It can measure temperature with an accuracy of 0.1 degrees Celsius.". Then as he played with it we started talking about how he used to type out paper punched cards on a mechanical typewriter when he had one of his earlier jobs a few decades ago. So a few decades into the future, we may tell the future generation how we used to put a plastic card into a machine just to be able to buy groceries, and that we used to call that "swiping the card through the reader".\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punched_card  \nand also here is a link to a "typewriter" for those of you young enough to maybe not have seen one:  \nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typewriter': 2, 'Do you know many people who own IP addresses?\n': 2, 'How did you find out about Bitcoin ?

But when added up over enough time, or enough people, it can be substantial.\n\nConsider a streaming service where each second costs a satoshi.  You watch an hour and it costs 3,600 satoshi, or .0036 bitcoins.  An insignificant amount (if a bitcoin was $1,000 that would = $3.60).  But when 1,000 people watch it, suddenly that\'s 3.6 bitcoins worth.\n\nOr how about a site like Reddit where instead of meaningless upvotes and downvotes and karma, people voiced their opinion by voting with satoshis.  A site where an upvote wasn\'t just a meaningless number, it costs some some (lets just say 50 satoshis, which would be equal to about a penny if bitcoins costs $1,000).  Again, not enough to be of any concern to a single individual.  But now, when a post gets 4,000 upvotes, that would be valuable to the content creator as it would be worth 200,000 satoshi (or .2 bitcoins).\n\nThis is the paradigm shifting potential of bitcoin.  It has the potential to empower viewers to voice their opinion with their time/attention/votes/etc, while properly rewarding content creators for delivering worthy content.\n': 1, 'Did you pledge over the lighthouse client?

This keeps the decentralization of Bitcoin intact while scaling it to VISA levels easily.

The payment system would avoid dustspam because it would package all viewers' payments into one transaction.\n\nLong term goals could include streamer-defined rates, adding videos for later viewing for a fixed price, comment threads and shit.\n\nMy brain example is MKBHD doing a live CES stream. He gets huge youtube numbers for his videos (2.3 million subscribers!), but people want the news immediately, and I imagine a large number wouldn't question 1cent per minute.\n\nAn alternative example which would most likely arise is camgirls which would probably be a lucrative business, but I would recommend keeping separate from the main app.\n\nI've just realised how awesome my idea is, so if anyone makes this, I demand 20% of the company.": 5, 'Important to me: do we know what license it will be released under?': 1, "We've known about these style of methods for years... it's the details, implementation, communication network, etc that need to be built.(oh and there are some nice bells and whistles on Lightning Network we didn't have before)  \n\nI'm a 5 year bear, 10 year bull because of this.

And you have to accomplish this with no hand-waving, no Moon Maths, and no bugs.\n\nI personally think that some trick of publicly escrowing some bitcoin, and some other side channel of 'liens' against that escrowed bitcoin, with these kinds of countdown clocks before all must settle up - that's the insight that I think Lightning Network got right. \n\nI also have a vested interest in hoping Lightning Network is right, because if they are, then payment channels are created by people who actually have some bitcoin, and while it's locked up in these transactions, it's committed to use - and makes less bitcoin available to others - drives scarcity - makes bitcoin more expensive to purchase - but just as useful to use - and ideally means that someday, the bigger your company is in purchasing power, the more bitcoin you need to buy.

If I need to buy oil down the road, I can choose to wait, or buy oil futures.  Thus, if there's a huge rise in the price of oil down the road, I come out ahead if I buy the futures.
