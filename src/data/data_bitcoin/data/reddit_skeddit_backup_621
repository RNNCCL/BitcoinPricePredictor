Or, sending off your identity docs to some new company that you may or may not trust.\n\nWith the ETF, millions of users who are already set up to trade shares on the Nasdaq will be able to speculate on bitcoin with the click of a button.\n\nThe other thing is that investment funds have rules on what assets they can hold, and an ETF would allow them to allocate to some money into bitcoin whereas before they couldn't.": 2, "With bitcoin you're your own bank and you can become a target if someone knows you own a lot of bitcoin.

Ultimately, the more savvy would hold their coins in offline cold storage wallets and newer types would use online wallets like Blockchain.info, coinbase.com, circle.com to store the coins. You can easily buy coins by using coinbase or circle. If you use wallets from coinbase you won't exactly own them even if you have a tough private key cause the exchange holds them in IOU form although barring any govt interference, you should be safe. If I were you, I'd keep part of the stash on blockchain and the other on coinbase that way you're not all in one basket barring any horror stories. If you can figure out offline cold storage you're probably better off.

Walmart for example is usually 3% off. Right now they are 4.2% off. Target is currently 4% off. \nWe offer an additional discount of 3% to customers who use Bitcoin or Direct Bank Deposit. So yes, Walmart cards at this moment would be 7.2% off.

It helps us advance the technology and web development that it takes to do things you all want.\nThat said, we\'re still growing. If you order a card that can be used online as an eCard, it still has to be created by one of us and manually marked Completed for the email to go out. So if you put your order in at 2 AM it might be 10 hours before you get your codes. \n\nThe most time consuming part of processing orders is screening for credit card fraud. With Bitcoin we are able to send out as soon as we can pull up Blockchain and check our wallets. Bitcoin orders are sent out faster than any other orders because of the inherent security features.\n\nYes, every now and then a card will go bad. If a card is going to go bad, it\'s usually going to happen within 48 hours of us buying it. For your own peace of mind we offer a Guarantee on all cards we sell. We guarantee to replace any lost balance for up to 45 days after your purchase. We check every cards balance before we send it out, so the chances of you receiving a bad card are slim. If it does happen, we investigate what happened and make it right.\n\nI hope this answers the major questions thus far. We\'re not invincible, we\'re not the most gorgeous site on the web.

Both contribute to the network effect.': 13, 'Your analogy is fundamentally flawed. On one hand you are analyzing a commodity and in your example you are discussing a service industry.\n\nCredit cards (and credit card companies) are a financial lending/credit service. There are many advantages to using these services: they often simplify purchasing processes, offer rewards programs, and (as you said) they can mitigate risk. There are also many disadvantages to using these services: payments are delayed (if you accept cc payments you won\'t actually receive the money for 3-5 days), the services are expensive (cc fees are significant), and the service provider can dictate where you\'re allowed to spend your funds (Visa has the power to review and deny any potential spending - for example international purchases or gambling). All of these are reasons that many small businesses cannot afford the services of a credit card company (again, remember that credit card companies offer a service, not a tradable commodity).\n\nBitcoin is a freely traded, controllable commodity or currency. Bitcoin is not a service that charges fees, or a company that offers credit loans. It is something that can be gathered and spent in a "push payment" system. These are all properties of fiat currencies - not financial services. Bitcoin is NOT analogous to credit cards - it is analogous to Internet cash.\n\nInstead of comparing the experience of purchasing a game on steam with a credit card, you should ask yourself: would it ever be useful for me to pay for an online service like steam with cash? In your example above you stated that credit cards offer you a better value because steam might not be trustworthy enough to deliver you a working product and you can chargeback. But at the same time, by the very nature of paying with a credit card, you are sharing loads of private identification information with a company that you don\'t even trust to deliver you a working video game. In many cases cash transactions are less risky, and in every case cash transactions are cheaper because you don\'t have a credit/lending service acting as a middle man. Think of all the small businesses that currently exist who are unable to afford credit card processing fees.\n\nAlso, remember that credit card companies could easily exist in the Bitcoin ecosystem just as they exist in the Australian economy and American economy, etc. Credit card companies are lending services established on top of existing currencies. They could just as easily be established within the Bitcoin infrastructure in the future.
