And no they haven't been consistent. Even in this video they imply they stored the Gutenberg library. Hilariously, that is a library that is always in Flux because it is actively edited. Also storj doesn't exist and likely never will. ": 0, "The exact opposite of a bullet-proof guarantee would be a bullet-proof promise to destroy...  I am not making a straw man argument as much as blunting the implied assertion that Factom doesn't store data at all.\n\nFactom is built to scale far beyond the data entry rate of Bitcoin.  As such, if full nodes (nodes able to validate commits and reveals) had to hold all the data, then very few people could run full nodes.  Look at Bitcoin, and the number of full nodes has been in decline for a while.  Much of it because of the weight of running a full node.   What Factom nodes will look like, and what will be required of them is still a matter of design.  But running a full node will not require holding all the data ever submitted to Factom.\n\nThe video.   I'll give you that point.  I spend a good bit of time making sure the people that make these videos do not claim Factom stores data.  Factom creates a verification and validation layer that will exist forever.  And if you have the data, you can thus validate your child's birth certificate as being the one submitted to Factom in the past.  If your jurisdiction accepts such validation, then you have quite a bit of value here.  We are talking to some governments to help them do this.\n\nLastly, I do think that many nodes for a long time will hold all the data.  And perhaps many nodes will always hold all the data.\n\nIt will only take one node holding your data to validate it against Factom.\n\n": 1, "If it's your data, you can choose where to store it.
