So QE for the next 500 years is unlikely to work, there just aren't enough assets to buy.\n\nBut I think where you were going was can QE be done long-term without penalty?  QE isn't even about the purchases, it's just a communication strategy (sadly).  An inefficient communication strategy, but it is what it has become.  A central bank engaging in QE indicates they are willing to support more inflation and nominal growth in the future.  A central bank that is cutting back on QE, or even raising overnight interest rates, is indicating they want lower inflation and nominal growth.\n\nIf it took a small amount of QE, say $5-10 billion/month, to keep inflation from going negative then yeah, they could probably keep it up for years and years with absolutely no downside at all.": 1, "Yes, the US has been growing well the last 2-3 years.

Economically speaking, the US has been growing well for the last 2-3 years and it probably makes sense to begin tightening monetary policy a bit as a result. However, the Fed knows that their actions have global impacts, and they don't want to create problems with Europe or be responsible for another wave of defaults in the global south. Hence why they haven't raised rates yet - doing so would siphon money out of Europe, worsening its deflation problem.\n\nI think they will raise rates, but I think they will do it slowly and over a long period of time to make the global adjustment gradual instead of sharp and Volcker-esque.

These methods may be combined.\n\nThe starter kit does not have to be able to make 100% of its own parts, especially not at first, and does not have to be 100% automated at first.  The main feature is the ability to upgrade over time to higher capabilities.  The seed part of the name comes from how an acorn is the seed that grows into a tree.  Acorns don\'t copy themselves directly.  They first grow to a higher capability, and *then* make copies.\n\nA seed factory is more of a concept than a building.  You *can* locate the machines in one place for convenience, but another option is a distributed factory.  That\'s where different machines are in different places, with different owners, but collaborate electronically.  This is what makes it on-topic for /r/bitcoin - In a distributed version, payments to each owner can be via escrowed bitcoin transactions.  As each one finishes their part of the work, the payment gets released.  In an ideal version, distribution of parts files and payments can all be automated.\n\nAs the seed factory upgrades, it can make more and more of its own parts, and have more robots and automation.  At the start, though, you will need to purchase parts and materials, and use manual labor when necessary.\n\nWhat goes in the starter kit depends on where you are using it and what the desired final products are.  The prototype version we are working towards includes [8 machines](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Seed_Factories/Starter_Set), plus making attachments for them to be more flexible, and some conventional workshop tools.  \n\nWe are nowhere near done with the work on this idea, but a goal for the "Personal Factory" version is individuals in a metropolitan area can split up the cost for the starter kit. Then they start to upgrade to where they can produce most of their physical needs (food, shelter, utilities, etc) and enough surplus to trade for the stuff they can\'t make.  If the end-version expanded factory is mostly automated, their needs are taken care of without a lot of work.  This answers the question of "what do we do when robots take our jobs?" with "we have our own robots (and other machines) and don\'t need a job."  I think that is a better answer than Basic Income, which some people are proposing.  Basic Income leaves you at the mercy of whoever collects taxes and sends out the payments.  If you have your own production ability, you are not at the mercy of some politician or bureaucrat.\n\n': 2, 'Yes, exactly!\n\nBusiness have many currencies.

That means tracking things like energy and raw materials into and out of a factory, not just money.  In order for the factory to function, the books have to balance on *all* the resources consumed.  If you don\'t produce that resource in-house, then it has to be supplied from outside.\n\nResource accounting can be handled with the same tools as money accounting, like spreadsheets.

The bad guys can pass their ill-gotten gains through a few cash-intensive businesses for a 50% cut. It's a just cost of their (often lucrative) business.\n\nCheap, practical, realistic privacy is for normal people.\n\n* You wouldn't want your employer knowing which nonprofits you support from your salary.\n\n* You wouldn't want your landlord knowing how much you earn, thus knowing exactly how much to raise the rent by.\n\n* You wouldn't want data mining companies bringing you targeted adverts based on your spending habits.\n\n* You wouldn't want your competitors analyzing your business' spending and learning trade secrets.\n\nIn it's current form, bitcoin is unacceptable to many potential legitimate users because of the privacy issues. \n\n> As someone with clean coins it feels like I'd be taking a risk exchanging them for dirty ones that have a unknown history behind them. I could be taking on the coins of someone who is a known MGOX hacker for example.\n\nThe MtGox hacker has probably already sold his bitcoins. When you use JoinMarket to mix you are probably mixing with investors of bitcoins who would own them anyway and have put them into the JoinMarket bot to earn an income from them. These investors have probably bought the coins from a regulated exchange.\n\nWhat is a US coin or a China coin? I do not recognize that concept. Bitcoin and software built on top of it does not care for nations or borders. :)\n\nIf this service is labelled as money laundering, they will have to say cash and casino chips are for money laundering too.

Possible factors might include the size and perhaps the age of the utxos you offer for mixing.

CoinJoining with Uncle Sam still keeps the CCP in the dark.) This project would still go a huge way towards increasing general privacy against all but the most determined enemies, and restoring fungibility.\n\nGovernments may have unlimited fiat but they don't have unlimited value. Printing a couple more billion doesn't increase the amount of value in the real economy. Anyway if they really had an unlimited budget they could put a huge amount of bitcoin full nodes online and crowd out everyone else.\n\nRing signatures or other exotic crypto would require a hard fork or an altcoin. Bitcoin has an overwhelming amount of liquidity, market cap, users, etc. The point of privacy is that you hide amongst the crowd, an altcoin focused only on privacy still provides a smaller anonymity set.\n\nThis project provides a much larger anonymity set because it convinces normal bitcoin investors, many of whom bought coins from fully-regulated exchanges, to mix with you.

So if Sybil gets in the channel and participates, can they guess who got paid what by the fees attached? The fees would seem to go for sure to particular people. Later if they use those fees in a wallet, I can guess it's them and not the person tumbling. Would some randomness around the fees paid be helpful?\n\nAn individual maker's fees won't be too different from anyone else because of market forces. There will surely be many many people offering to make coinjoin at almost exactly the same fee.\n\n> And is it best to have, say you want 5 people to sign, does it force it to be evenly sized pieces by each signer? Can I game this system by having 5 small accounts, so that I get to sign and participate in as many signings as possible? (It's not helping them much because they're mixing with one other person). Maybe as part of opsec, the IRC channel should let you see the IP address of who is connecting? and mark if they are VPN / TOR etc? And maybe if they have a root key that they mix over and over from so that they could announce that too and you could inspect these mixer people and get a sense of how good they seem to be at mixing things and truly how much bitcoin they have there? Not sure. I guess I just want to know who the large bitcoin wallets and old established tumblers are. If they're getting too established, then I know they're a tumbler; not sure how this games out.\n\nThere is a disincentive against this happening because it's likely that large single coins will earn a higher fee than split up small coins.\n\nImagine how many people own 0.1btc vs how many people own 10kbtc. Lack of supply will make the price go up, so people will have an incentive to lump their coins together not split them up.\n\n> Visualizing the order book for mixing - it would be a really interesting graph .... it could show how many coins you can mix (the market depth) as a height, and going out on the X axis (getting worse) would be the interest rate you pay to mix?

This could be resolved though e.g. by offering something like a "mixing Monday" where all proposals are batched together in 2-3 1 hour slots during every Monday and if one wants to take part in this, all you need to do is to get all proposals, sign them offline and submit them back within that hour.

That\'s why, just last year, he signed on as a digital marketing manager with digital currency bitcoin processor BitPay and recently took another job at a start-up that\'s so cutting-edge it hasn\'t officially launched.\n\nTo understand how advanced the 30-year old Warren, Mich., native really is, you need to understand blockchain technology and how it\'s used to transfer bitcoin, a form of public digital currency maintained by its users rather than the government.\n\nBitcoin is processed through a decentralized ledger called the blockchain that records every transaction on the Bitcoin network, through which every transfer of funds needs to be verified before the next transaction can happen.  The technology has received a lot of media attention since it was introduced in 2009, both positive and negative.  Confused?  Imaging ???ching that every day.\n\nIt was Sakich\'s job at BitPay - based in Atlanta, GA., where he now lives - to explain this to anyone who would ask, create digital marketing campaigns for the bitcoin processor and more.  "Sometimes it\'s like what it would be like explaining the Internet to someone in 1993.  They\'d look like a deer in headlights."\n\nIn his short time at the currency distributor, Sakich saw clients such as Warner Bros. Records, rapper 50 Cent, Microsoft and more sign on to start making transactions with bitcoin.  He also launched the most successful social media campaign for the currency and the NCAA Bitcoin Bowl in St. Petersburg, Fla., working with online money distributer ChangeTip to hand out $10,000 in bitcoins to Twitter users who used the hashtag #BitcoinBowl.\n\nHe loved the energy at BitPay, he says, but has since transitioned to a role with tech start-up Augur - another open-source, decentralized platform dealing with prediction markets.

This required users to backup their wallets frequently, since the new keys needed to be backed up as well as the old keys.  Quite a few people who lost their computer restored the wallet from an old backup and found that they lost the newer private keys that had been added since the backup.\n\nHD, Heirarchically Deterministic, wallets generate a single random seed (also called the 'master private key') when the wallet is created.  All of the other private keys (and the corresponding public addresses) the wallet will use are generated from that single base.  A backup done when the wallet was created can be used even years later to restore all of the addresses generated from that same seed.  \n\nAn HD wallet also has the concept of a 'master public key'.  This can be used on a website, for example, to generate all of the public addresses, but cannot generate the private keys for those addresses.  This makes the master public key very useful and very secure.  You can store the master public key in your website and issue a unique payment address for every customer.  You can give the master public key to your accountant and they can track your transactions and balances without giving them any ability to spend your bitcoin.\n\nAnother variant is BIP44 HD wallets.  These allow you to create subaccounts.  Each subaccount has its own master private key and master public key.  If a corporation were to implement this strategy, the various vice presidents could be issued a unique subaccount for their part of the company.  Each department head under them could be issued a subaccount under their VP's, and each team could even have their own subaccount under their department head.  The VP would be able to regenerate and spend from their subaccount and any generated underneath it, and the master public key for their subaccount could see all of the activity for their subaccount.  A department head could only spend bitcoin under their subaccount, and a team could only spend bitcoin from addresses under their subaccount.

That remainder is your next key.\n\nSince the remainder of something divided by 10 is always less than 10, you'll always have a valid private key.

The thin clients themselves don\'t interact directly with the blockchain or even Blockchain.info\'s servers as it appears you may have thought. They have their own layer of specialty servers that act as middlemen. There was a discussion in here recently about how the Electrum clients send dozens of addresses to the intermediate Electrum servers for processing and that if you truly want to protect your privacy you should run your own Electrum "middle tier" servers and use encryption everywhere.\n\nOP didn\'t yet understand the role that word lists play in key generation in HD wallets and was worried that if the intermediate servers that are tied to a specific app go away, his clients would die and he would suddenly lose access to all his funds.
