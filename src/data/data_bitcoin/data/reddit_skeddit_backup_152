Once services like Uber or Airbnb scale large enough (to the point where governments will care), there is a significant contingent of people who derive real economic value from them and thus will push back against heavy-handed government response.

Any practical enforcement regime would probably take the form of random inspections, with fines & penalties for those caught. If we model this as essentially a form of "natural disaster," we can start to think about decentralized insurance contracts against this risk.

The whole point of crime-and-punishment theory is that if you set F * p > r (that\'s fine * probability of getting caught > revenue), then the expected utility of committing the crime is negative and no amount of insurance can get around that. An efficient insurance market definitely will push the enforcement costs somewhat higher, as you can\'t rely on risk aversion to make "perceived F" higher than "actual F", but only so much; at some point even without risk aversion it stops being worth it.\n\n>  but whether we\'re talking about Sweden or North Korea, there is a practical line that if crossed will result in "revolt,"\n\nTrue, but I don\'t think that even the loss of 2x efficiency gains from hyper-efficient uncensored sharing economy platforms is going to do it.
