It's a logic-based argument, so equations and numbers would just be illustrative; I'm doing this in my spare time so I didn't feel it was worth adding them on for this article. Feel free to read the whole article and, if you have any numbers or equations which would be a problem for my argument, I'm all ears.\n\n> the cost to include a transaction at time of writing is negligible relative to the cost of electricity for hashing.\n\nYes, which I mentioned. It doesn't matter how low the cost of inclusion is, the ultimate equilibrium voluntary transaction fee should be equally negligible. There may be a lower bound because miners become apathetic about including transactions when the TX fee is so low, but that in itself supports my argument - the lower bound holds no premium for hashing, it is only enough to convince a miner to include the TX.\n\n> I'd note that Bitcoin will continue to function just fine even if the hashrate declined\n\nBitcoin without any hashing would be useless. Everyone that I know of agrees on that. So if we agree that some hashing is needed, the question is therefore *how much* and *how do we get it?* Right now we don't have to worry about that because Satoshi gave us some magic numbers (the current fixed block reward x the current price of Bitcoin gives us a monetary incentive which drives a certain level of investment in mining, which produces hashing.) In future we will need an answer. How soon depends on when Satoshi's scheduled block reward first drops below the level of hashing the community considers adequate.  \n\n> ASIC technology continues to advance and the cost per gigahash of operating ASICs continues to decline.\n\nI think you have things a little backwards here. The absolute level of hashing doesn't matter. Like in all fields, competitive pressure will drive increased efficiency in hashing, so over time at a constant block reward we'd expect hashing difficulty to increase. The thing that really matters is the financial investment required to deploy a majority attack against the network, and measuring hashing power is just a proxy for measuring how expensive such an attack is. How much money does it cost to buy enough rigs to have a majority? The higher the block reward = more money offered to incentivise mining = more money invested in mining = more expensive such an attack is.": 0, "Thanks, did you read the article? I was also arguing against relying on altruism. \n\n> let's try to stave off anticipated issues with the network just in case the market somehow cannot handle them\n\nAre you talking about the need for a market for payments for relaying blocks and transactions? That's an interesting issue and one I'm interested in as well, but I'm actually focussing this series specifically on the question of incentivising *hashing power.* I think network propagation is an issue where the market may spontaneously form solutions, paying for hashing power however requires most likely as far as I can tell majority support for new consensus rules. That's something where community discussion does matter quite a lot. ": 1, 'Altruism is just a crutch. Network security will be powered by economic incentives, or it won\'t be secure. The main "problem" is that scarcity has yet to become a big enough issue for an economic structure to develop, where miners pay nodes or whatever, so that pricing develops. \n\nBy all means let\'s try to stave off anticipated issues with the network just in case the market somehow cannot handle them, but let\'s not make the mistake of assuming that this means it is *unlikely* for the market to be able to handle them. In other words, don\'t let solutions to as-yet non-existent problems make us think we *need* such solutions so badly that we would have to rely on something flimsy and unsustainable, like altruism. This network has to be strong enough to resist the fiercest, most motivated enemies.': 2, 'Your series appears to be predicated upon the claim that "Purely voluntary transaction fees will never form a sustainable foundation for network security."\n\nIn part 1 of your series, you state:\n> \n> The users of the resulting network pay no premium for any extra computing power beyond that required to verify and include their transactions. Even an incredibly popular network processing myriad transactions would be no solution, for the same calculus holds true no matter whether the network processes 10 transactions per second or 10 thousand: each given transaction pays for its direct costs and no more. Larger blocks would reap more in fees, but cost equally more in processing, and there would still be no premium for network security.\n> \n> No miner in such a network would be able to recoup the cost of computation for hashing, inherently a cost additional to that of including transactions. Without any security premium paid by transactions, over time the network would trend towards zero hashing power. Unable to profit from hashing, miners would strip back their hardware installations to solely what was required to receive, validate, encapsulate and propagate transactions and blocks.\n>\n>Even before hashing power had completely evaporated, the rewards available to attackers to subvert the network would have long eclipsed the costs of mounting an attack, and the network, incapable of securing the value of its users\xe2\x80\x99 assets, would collapse. The value of bitcoin as a token would be completely destroyed.\n\nMy main issue with your claims is that you state them as if they are backed by math and economics but you never provide any numbers or equations. You also seem to be making a large assumption about the cost of miners including transactions - the cost to include a transaction at time of writing is negligible relative to the cost of electricity for hashing.\n\n\nYou also make some references to \'network security\' by which I assume you mean the global hashrate.

Miners are competing only for efficiency in block inclusion, not hashing, because there is no profit in hashing.\n\nYou are right that the least efficient miners would quit hashing first, but that is always true of the network.': 1, "I think that we both agree that hash power is relative, and we agree that the variables that influence mining result in miners competing to the point that they operate on the brink of profitability.\n\n>No miner in such a network would be able to recoup the cost of computation for hashing, inherently a cost additional to that of including transactions.\n\nThis is a dubious claim in my opinion, because every miner has different costs.

That way everything is encrypted and only becomes viewable to 3rd parties in the case of a dispute. \n\n\n>Maybe a page that displays the sellers disputes openly?\n\nAs someone who has sold stuff on various sites, I don't like that idea. I've had plenty of buyers who were unreasonable and had complaints related to things that are out of a sellers control, like shipping times, item malfunctioning after misuse, etc. I think something similar to eBay, how they only ding the seller for disputes that aren't resolved would nice. If there is an issue or a difficult buyer, I would like to be able resolve it first before making the issue public. Sometimes shit just happens, and that is a part of business; it's how a seller handles problems that should matter most, because all sellers will have problems with orders to some extent. As enough sellers start using a platform, it seems like you could gauge what is an acceptable percentage of problematic orders for various categories. eBay allows 2% before dinging the seller, and unresolved issues could be weighted differently. \n\nMaybe more transparency would be good though, but only if it goes both ways. On eBay, I have to cave to every demand a buyer makes, because negative feedback is a major detractor for my business and I'll do anything to maintain that 100% top rated status, but eBay only allows the seller to leave positive feedback for buyers, regardless of how difficult that buyer was. If a buyer has little reputation and receives negative feedback from multiple sellers, their feedback left for a seller should be negated or removed. Conversely, if a highly rated buyer leaves negative feedback, that is probably an accurate reflection of the transaction and should be left alone. \n\nAn example of an issue I've had in the past:\n\nI was selling some magnifying vanity mirrors from a very popular brand. I had sold a few dozen already and then I had a buyer who placed an order and received the same exact item I'd been shipping for weeks. All the other buyers had left positive feedback, item just as described, etc, but this buyer complained that it didn't match the description and didn't light up. I never said it lit up, it wasn't in the description that it lit up, but because the buyer assumed it lit up and wanted one that lit up, it became my fault for not shipping them something that I never even claimed to have. They threatened me with negative feedback, refused to pay for return shipping, and opened a case, which forced my hand into giving them a full refund, and losing on shipping both ways. I had no way of leaving them negative feedback, and even though I wasn't in the wrong, it was the threat to my feedback rating that forced my hand. \n\nI want to make sure buyers are happy, don't get me wrong, but I also want buyers to be held responsible for their actions. I would gladly accept a return if the buyer shipped it back, but I shouldn't be forced into making a decision of losing money or protecting my feedback rating when I did my part just as with the other dozens of transactions that had no issue. \n": 2, 'Yeah but on a completely serious note.. the next big nut to crack is order fulfillment.

To get around this the newest version of Electrum has Trezor support so this can be avoided. From a hacking standpoint, they are very robust, as the wallet can be password protected to prevent it being loaded (and means you can also setup dummy wallets in case someone forces you to reveal your password), and the pin to send funds is also resistant to brute forcing as each failure kicks in a delay that lengthens for every subsequent failed pin entry. The cases are permanently sealed so it is resistant to physical tampering too.\n\nFrom a connectivity standpoint, it always requires you to plug it into a usb port so it can't be used wirelessly (though this also means it doesn't require a battery or charging which can be considered a plus depending on how you look at it), and there are currently no mobile wallets that have integrated the Trezor yet, so it's still relegated to desktops ATM. \n\n\n\n": 5, 'I have a Trezor and just love it.

Again, he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t compete on costs with U.S. artists.\n> \n> Ifill\xe2\x80\x99s problem stems in part from the difficulty in shifting money around the region\xe2\x80\x99s island nations, which requires constant and costly currency exchanges. Barbados and virtually every nation in the British West Indies has its own, sepa\xc2\xadrately printed currency\xe2\x80\x94each called the dollar, each fluctuating in value against the others and against the better-known U.S. dollar. And the for\xc2\xadmer Spanish, Dutch, and French colonies all have their own pesos, guil\xc2\xadders, and gourdes. The governments of the region have long talked about creating a monetary union to deepen the region\xe2\x80\x99s free-trade arrangement, the Caricom common market. But as with the development of that free-trade area, progress toward building a single monetary authority and the other institutions needed for a common currency has been fitful. A Ca\xc2\xadribbean dollar remains a pipe dream.\n> \n> To make matters worse, a number of central banks impose capital controls on their citizens. Barbadians such as Ifill, for in\xc2\xadstance, are limited in the amount of foreign currency they can buy. That Barbados, the Cayman Islands, the Bahamas, and other Caribbean na\xc2\xadtions serve as tax havens for hedge funds and other foreign financial in\xc2\xadstitutions is an irony not lost on the region\xe2\x80\x99s tightly controlled residents.

He is the CEO of Web Designs, a local business that sells Internet domain registrations, Web site designs, maintenance, and e-commerce platforms. The last has been a particularly tough sell. Because of the costs of foreign exchange, credit cards, and PayPal, which can add up to eight or nine percent, he said, most merchants\xe2\x80\x94Ifill was one of them\xe2\x80\x94simply avoid sell\xc2\xading abroad.\n> \n> Abed learned of bitcoin early on and saw its potential to solve this problem. He began with the idea of a Caribbean cryptocurrency, which he dubbed CaribCoin, but realized quickly it was a bigger project than he wanted to take on. He pivoted to the idea of a bitcoin exchange, and a merchant service that he could bundle with his Web-design and hosting service, and began building Bitt (the URL is actually bi.tt, the .tt being the domain for neighboring Trinidad and Tobago). He also began min\xc2\xading his own bitcoins\xe2\x80\x94in Trinidad, taking advantage of relatively low electricity costs there, and using the profits from that and from Web Designs to fund Bitt. \n> \n> Bitt is designed as a Caribbean-focused online exchange and mer\xc2\xadchant service, providing trading between different cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies, as well as a module for helping local businesses adopt digi\xc2\xadtal currencies for payment. His appeal to them is simple: What if I can give you a payment option that costs only one percent?\n> \n> The catch is that the one percent fee comes with bitcoins, which as of this writing can\xe2\x80\x99t buy you much in Barbados. To say that cryptocurren\xc2\xadcies are not big in Barbados would be an understatement. They effectively don\xe2\x80\x99t exist on the island, and neither does mobile commerce. While vir\xc2\xadtually everybody has a cell phone, the proverbial badge of a digital citi\xc2\xadzen, people use them only for texting and talking. E-commerce is barely getting started, as is online banking.\n> \n> The way to get over the chicken-and-egg problem and encourage adoption, Abed believes, is to focus on the merchants. He believes that if he can offer them a dramatically cheaper payment method, they can be talked into accepting that method at their shops. But he has his work cut out for him.\n> \n> ': 10, "This is an excellent excerpt from Vigna and Casey's book on cryptocurrencies.

The current business model relies on electronic transfers over the old banking rails, and its practitioners charge high fees for that priv\xc2\xadilege. Globally, it\xe2\x80\x99s a huge business.\n> \n> Emigrants are expected to send home more than $500 billion in 2016, according to the World Bank. \xe2\x80\x9cThose are only the official flows,\xe2\x80\x9d says Dilip Ratha, an expert on the subject who tracks it for the World Bank. Another estimated $200 billion is sent that isn\xe2\x80\x99t tracked by the bank. Those numbers dwarf the roughly $125 billion the developed world sends annually in aid. For many countries, more money comes in through remittances than through exports. Moreover, the to\xc2\xadtals are net of the charges and fees emigrants pay to transfer agents such as Western Union; on average those costs are about 8.5 percent globally, but in many countries, it\xe2\x80\x99s roughly 10 percent or more. In countries where annual salaries can be counted in hundreds of dollars, those costs are a serious burden. \n> \n> Kenyans living abroad who want to send money home can choose be\xc2\xadtween, say, Western Union and MoneyGram, but both charge high fees. Although at 42 percent the proportion of Kenyan adults with a formal banking relationship exceeds that of many countries, a majority in the country are still unbanked. But Kenya\xe2\x80\x99s experience with microfinance and telecommunications has inspired people\xe2\x80\x99s imaginations over how to ad\xc2\xaddress some of these problems. In particular, the excitement revolves around one key product: M-Pesa.\n> \n> M-Pesa (the M is for \xe2\x80\x9cmobile,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cpesa\xe2\x80\x9d is Swahili for \xe2\x80\x9cmoney\xe2\x80\x9d) started out as an experiment by Kenya\xe2\x80\x99s biggest telecom company, Safa\xc2\xadricom. Because many more Kenyans had phones than bank accounts, mi\xc2\xadcrofinance experts realized during the 2000s that they could use those phones to deliver loans to borrowers and receive repayments from them. So in 2007, Safaricom began a pilot program that allowed users to send money via their phones\xe2\x80\x94effectively converting the standard units of pre\xc2\xadpaid calling minutes into a form of currency. The system proved wildly popular. Today two-thirds of Kenyans use it, and about 25 percent of Ken\xc2\xadya\xe2\x80\x99s GDP flows through it. \n> \n> M-Pesa had a few things going for it. For one thing, Safaricom al\xc2\xadready had a massive infrastructure in place, not just the telecommunica\xc2\xadtions equipment, but also thousands of agents. M-Pesa was also lucky enough to escape government regulation early on.\n> \n> But here\xe2\x80\x99s the rub: M-Pesa is not a frictionless system, and what appears automatic to the user has a massive, unwieldy, and expensive infrastruc\xc2\xadture behind it. Safaricom\xe2\x80\x99s agents must deal with huge amounts of cash daily. This is not only cumbersome, but can also be dangerous. When agents run out of money, they have to either stop what they\xe2\x80\x99re doing, close the shop, and go to a bank, or stop what they\xe2\x80\x99re doing and send some\xc2\xadbody on their behalf. Agents in rural areas, where the customers are more likely to be withdrawing money rather than depositing it, face a special challenge: Not only is their liquidity\xe2\x80\x94their literal cash pile\xe2\x80\x94drained faster, but the odds are higher that they are farther away from a bank branch, meaning a trip there takes longer and leaves less time to do ac\xc2\xadtual business.\n> \n> Then there\xe2\x80\x99s the question of how to import funds into the M-Pesa system from overseas. It is not borderless. Its mobile, phone-linked sys\xc2\xadtem offers an easier \xe2\x80\x9con-ramp\xe2\x80\x9d for remittances than other countries\xe2\x80\x99 more traditional financial systems, but it\xe2\x80\x99s still going through traditional pipe\xc2\xadlines. Vodafone has partnerships with MoneyGram, Western Union, and other payment networks\xe2\x80\x94with all their routine fees and banking-system\xc2\xad dependent costs. With bitcoin, it is possible to send money via a mobile phone, directly between two parties, to bypass that entire cumbersome, expensive system for international transfers.\n> \n> Perhaps inevitably, then, someone like Duncan Goldie-Scot, a vet\xc2\xaderan of microfinance, would come to see Kenya as the right place to start a full-scale remittance business. He approached fellow microfinance ex\xc2\xadpert Elizabeth Rossiello, a native of Queens, New York, who was then working as a consultant in Kenya, with an idea: How about combining M-Pesa with a digital currency? It would offer all the advantages of M-Pesa, but would make the costs to users even cheaper for those who import money into that system from abroad, because those remittances from rel\xc2\xadatives in London or New York would arrive via bitcoin rather than the traditional banking system. Call it BitPesa.\n> \n> They would begin with a simple and achievable goal: Take a single \xe2\x80\x9ccorridor\xe2\x80\x9d in the remittance business\xe2\x80\x94between the United Kingdom and Kenya\xe2\x80\x94and build a bitcoin-based money-transfer business around it. They hired a development team to build the initial prototype, then a coder to revamp it. Next, they sent a staff member to London, to go into the caf\xc3\xa9s in the Kenyan neighborhoods and recruit beta testers for the ini\xc2\xadtial trials. They began their beta test in the summer of 2014 with about two dozen emigrants.\n> \n> Rossiello hadn\xe2\x80\x99t even heard of bitcoin until Goldie-Scot mentioned it to her. But she quickly caught on to the possibilities and now has am\xc2\xadbitions for BitPesa that go beyond bitcoin, or digital currencies. For all the good it has done, the microfinance industry pioneered by Nobel Peace Prize-winning Muhammad Yunus\xe2\x80\x99s Grameen Bank still operates within what she described as \xe2\x80\x9ca busted financial system.\xe2\x80\x9d An alternative based on cryptocurrency could bypass a lot of the costs of the existing system, and it offers the promise of doing more than just allowing cheap remit\xc2\xadtances.\n> \n> Rossiello sees bitcoin as a way to spark not just a financial revolu\xc2\xadtion in Kenya, but a technological one as well. The idea is that cryptocur\xc2\xadrency fosters innovation, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in San Francisco and other places. She has started a meetup culture and teaches coding to schoolchildren. Five people were at her first meetup; six months later, there were 40, and they were doing coding and coming up with their own apps. \xe2\x80\x9cPeople are responding, people are excited about it,\xe2\x80\x9d she says.\n> \n> As is the case with all efforts of outsiders attempting to better the lives of distant people, an uneasy awareness exists of the legacy of colo\xc2\xadnialism and the fine line between assistance and paternalism. It\xe2\x80\x99s important to resist the impulse to view cryptocurrencies\xe2\x80\x99 tech\xc2\xadnology, or any technology, as a panacea. For all the promise that tech\xc2\xadnology holds\xe2\x80\x94this idea that developing nations are going to \xe2\x80\x9cleapfrog\xe2\x80\x9d decades of development thanks to cheap, distributed, decentralized technology\xe2\x80\x94the reality on the ground resists easy solutions. What M-Pesa has achieved, and what BitPesa promises, matter because they are effec\xc2\xadtive tools for promoting economic activity, and thus development. This is why the stories coming out of Silicon Savannah are important\xe2\x80\x94not only for Kenya but for the developing world as a whole. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a much big\xc2\xadger story here,\xe2\x80\x9d Rossiello says. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re just getting started.\xe2\x80\x9d\n> \n> From The Age of Cryptocurrency by Paul Vigna and Michael J. Casey. Copyright \xc2\xa9 2015 by the authors and reprinted by permission of St. Martin\xe2\x80\x99s Press, LLC.\n> ': 6, '> EARLY ADOPTERS\n> \n> The chicken-and-egg dilemma will require incentives. The promise of sav\xc2\xading money is certainly one of them. But there are others. As in the devel\xc2\xadoped world, one hope is that if big firms or institutions whose relationships run deep in the economy start using bitcoin, they can create incentives for their suppliers and customers to use it.\n> \n> Patrick Byrne, the CEO of Salt Lake City-based online retailer Over\xc2\xadstock.com, which began accepting bitcoin in early 2014 to become what was then the biggest revenue-earning merchant to do so, believes his firm can play such a catalytic role creating a bitcoin \xe2\x80\x9cecosystem\xe2\x80\x9d in the devel\xc2\xadoping world.\n> \n> When we met in June 2014 in Utah, Byrne explained that he viewed bitcoin as a way to widen economic opportunity, if only he could get people to accept it. He was still figuring out the carrots he would use, but he had some ideas. \xe2\x80\x9cIn the world of payments and dealing with vendors, there\xe2\x80\x99s all this sensitiv\xc2\xadity around the terms of payment. Vendors will sometimes give you a two percent discount for shaving off 20 days, because to them that\xe2\x80\x99s like a 36 percent cost of money over the year. That affects all kinds of things. The very fact that vendors offer those terms means there\xe2\x80\x99s an enor\xc2\xadmous opportunity for bitcoin to step up in this area.\xe2\x80\x9d A few weeks later, Byrne announced he would not only be paying bitcoin-accepting vendors one week early, but that he\xe2\x80\x99d also pay his employee bonuses in bitcoin. \n> \n> What companies such as Overstock are trying to do with digital-currency payments has parallels with what Walmart achieved by pio\xc2\xadneering communications technology to revolutionize supply-chain management in the 1990s and early 2000s. The Arkansas-based retailer famously developed a sophisticated network with which to tie all of its suppliers worldwide into a single, integrated database for managing the goods and services flowing in and out of Walmart\xe2\x80\x99s warehouses. Along with big improvements in shipping logistics, this allowed the company to optimize its just-in-time inventory management, which drastically cut costs. Walmart parlayed those cost savings into the cheapest prices any\xc2\xadwhere in the United States, which turned it into the iconic and, to some, infamous behemoth that now dominates American suburbia. \n> \n> Just as im\xc2\xadportant, its high-tech network had a feedback effect on suppliers, contrib\xc2\xaduting to the concentration of manufacturing in hubs such as China\xe2\x80\x99s Pearl River Delta. As Walmart became an increasingly powerful but relentless hunter of the cheapest manufacturing sources, and as other Western buy\xc2\xaders caught on to its high-tech lead, factories paying low wages in the de\xc2\xadveloping world would congregate in locales where it was most efficient to tap into Walmart\xe2\x80\x99s network. Byrne now sees similar opportunities for firms like his to build influence by leveraging bitcoin in its international payment relationships and thus creating a tipping point from which change starts rippling over the global economy. As a group of businesses in one region begins adopting the currency, it will become more appealing to others with whom they do business. Once such a network of intertwined businesses builds up, no one wants to be excluded from it. Or so the theory goes.\n> \n> \xe2\x80\x9cJust as American retail collapsed into Walmart, who knows how much can collapse into us? And I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean Overstock. I mean bitcoin,\xe2\x80\x9d Byrne said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou start getting network effects. You are incentivizing everyone\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s like we have the first fax machine but nobody else has a fax machine, so it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t do you any good. But you start adding other nodes and making incentives to add nodes and eventually get a critical mass.

Otherwise it shrinks.\n\nSee /u/coelomate\'s well written response.\n\nEDIT: I had mis-attributed the original question to /u/EvanHarper': 5, 'Payment, payee, blockchain - is also triangular.': 32, 'The bank takes on short term debt - most simply, a demand deposit checking or savings account, that theoretically could need to be repaid at any moment. The bank then gives out long-term loans - most simply, a house mortgage paid back over 30 years. The bank pays less interest to short-term depositors than it collects from its long-term borrowers.\n\nThere\'s nothing mystical, magical, or "musical chairs" involved, and you don\'t even need "a bank" to do something similar. If you hand me ten $10 bills, and in exchange I promise you access whenever you want but I\'ll pay you 1% interest, then I give $90 out to other people and charge them 3% interest, we\'re in the exact same spot.\n\nThe risk, of course, is a "run on the bank" where you want your $100 back and I can\'t give it to you because the $90 is still out on loan. The business of banking is managing that risk and earning a profit, and sometimes it goes poorly, which is what the FDIC exists for (note that banks pay premiums for FDIC insurance). In practice, it turns out not everyone needs their money all at once, and there\'s so value in that business - because there\'s demand for capital to Do Work (hire workers, improve property, open and fund businesses) and there\'s an ample supply of capital that people keep for themselves without having the means to evaluate projects and make loans. The bank, ideally, serves the role of compensating people for allocating their capital for other projects and earns money for themselves in the process.\n\nThe system has a number of flaws, risks, and weaknesses - plus a checkered past. It\'s great to engage in healthy debate on those points, but it\'s oversimplifying and a weak argument to just declare it fraud and musical chairs.

I'm sure textbook explanations are better than what you can find online.\n\nYou can think of central banks as rental stores for money that ask for collateral while their money is lent out (so that no one takes the money and runs!). They want the safest collateral possible and usually ask for government bonds.  Central banks get to control short term risk free nominal interest rates by competing on the markets using money.

In many cases this can be automated, but the banks are who determine what account to debit and credit, the banks are *handling* and *transmitting* the money, electronic or physical.  \n\nThe same applies to extensions of the traditional sytstem, like PayPal.  they are still handling the source account and transmitting the change to a bank, they are essentially a new type of bank.  There is many risks to banking systems, as enormous trust is placed in the bank and all of it\'s communications between other banks.  Being licensed to operate means they have shown they are capable of being trusted connected to a system that allows you to essentially pull money from anyone\'s account you please. There is much security in place to prevent this, but take the recent discovery of a virus that stole a billion dollars from many peoples accounts, no action on their part needed, just money extracted\n\nNow take blockchain technology.  None of this exists.  There is really nothing moving.  This is an entry in a transaction ledger, nothing more.  If you have the private key you can sign the entry in the ledger.  This transaction is entirely complete, 1 action by the "sender", no other intermediaries needed, and everyone almost immediately knows about it.  The only reason mining and confirmations are needed is to show that you have not signed another transaction already, but nothing stops you from doing this.  Then the only thing the miners do is look at all those transactions and creates a confirmation, in no way touching the transactions, all it is doing is adding a "stamp of approval".\n\nIn addition to all of this, everyone\'s account is never available for anyone to take at any time, all transaction have to be signed from the private key holder only, it is a one way transaction, no trust is needed to be sure you are not a bad guy (virus) that wants to take money from everyone account without any action on their part (this of course has nothing to do with lack of security of your private keys.

That makes making things cheaper, allowing for faster growth. This way is unpopular, because most people don't like their wages getting cut. There are also social and ethical issues with this approach, because you are effectively rewarding those with money (who will enjoy outsized profits from the newly-cheap labor) at the expense of the working class, whose wages were just cut. Also, there are more workers than factory owners, so in a democracy it is quite hard to convince the majority of the electorate to vote for lower wages.\n\nThe second option is to devalue your currency relative to your major trading partners. It has the same result as option 1, but is easier to implement. It punishes everyone (the rich lose value in their money, and the poor effectively earn less), but it has the same result.\n\nGreece's problem is that it can't restore competitiveness. German policies, different levels of productivity, and the strength of the Euro have meant that it is more expensive to make things in Greece than elsewhere. Greece needs to adjust. Option A (wage cuts) is on the table, but Greece would surely prefer Option B - its people have been subjected to five years of increasingly-harsh austerity already, and there's the very real chance that cutting wages only cuts demand further (if workers earn nothing, they can't buy anything).\n\nBitcoin does nothing to solve this problem. It replaces the Euro with Bitcoin, but bitcoin would have the same effect on Greece. Greece would be unable to devalue bitcoin until it is competitive again, and would therefore have to accept broad-ranging wage cuts. That would never fly politically.\n\nIn a bitcoin world, there would have to be no minimum wage, anywhere. Countries have different levels of productivity, and so the only way to make up for that difference is via wages that match that productivity. Today, different levels of productivity are handled via exchange rates (or, at least, should be ... see Greece).\n\nThe same problems are what plagued the gold standard, but goldbugs always seem to forget that part of the history.": 3, "I think it is possible for Greece to convert to bitcoin like this:\n\n* Sell some assets for bitcoin.

However, if the amount of the transaction is less than $20, the probability increases to 91 percent. If the transaction is greater than $20, the probability decreases to 57 percent. Individuals who stated a payment card preference were estimated to have approximately a 30 percent probability of a cash transaction overall, but that probability increases to 49 percent when the transaction is less than $20 and drops to 8 percent when purchases are over $20. These estimates were conducted using the Federal Reserve October 2012 Diary of Consumer Payment Choice dataset, which includes all the recorded financial transactions of approximately 2,500 individuals who participated in the diary during their variously assigned three consecutive-day periods within the month of October 2012. In addition to recording all their financial transactions, they answered questions regarding payment instrument and cash handling preferences. These regressions suggest cash continues to play a large role as a payment instrument especially in lower value transactions for all demographic groups.\n\nedit: I posit some people like using credit cards because it is perceived to be more "secure" than cash, as in the ability to do chargebacks and not get mugged for all you\'re worth is highly highly important.

I have witnessed Bitcoin since late 2010, and even though I found it interesting and understood the concept, I had doubted it for these reasons I had in my mind - but now that the price had risen into the triple digits, I began to question whether I was perhaps mistaken. The response I received from this community however was underwhelming. Few addressed my arguments in their responses, and of those who did, nothing refuted my arguments. In fact, I saw the same fallacious reasoning I had seen before, and I think even worse than before (in 2010/2011, getting rich quick was less of an expectation I think).\n\nI wrote in detail those arguments against Bitcoin's long-term viability, but since the account was deleted for making such posts as those already linked, I can't easily find them to link to.\n\nThe Willy Report, which came out a few months later, cleared up the last remaining doubt I had, which was 'If bitcoin is inherently flawed, why does the price continue to rise?', or perhaps more accurately, just simply 'Why are there continuing bubbles, and should I get on this bandwagon in the short-term even if its doomed long-term?'. We now know the the bubbles were caused by internal manipulation at MtGox by Mark Karpeles, a man convicted in absentia of fraud in France *before* he fled to Japan and bought MtGox off Jeb Celeb in 2011 - coincidentally just 1 month or so before the first big bubble.\n\n\n": 4, 'My prediction turned out to be fairly accurate, as well.

I mean, just look at your own reply, in which you seem to imply that I should not 'speak in absolutes' because (you believe) it is not tactful to do so.\n\nAnd you might also say, 'Who are you to speak of what is 'true''? - well if not me, then who? It is not useful to hold in one's mind a constant dilemma; solipsism will get you nowhere. One must always be willing to change one's mind, and to consider the arguments of others, but to say that one shouldn't dare hold an opinion lest it be wrong is not only overly cautious, it is foolish, because as Mill points out to us, even utterly *false* opinions are of great value to us, because their expression forces us to re-examine what we hold to be true. For instance, if I say to you 'The Earth is flat', then that is obviously false, but do you or most other people know how to prove the Earth is round?
