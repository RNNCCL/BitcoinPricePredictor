Perhaps it would mean more home hosted nodes rather than cloud hosted ones, though bandwidth costs vary by region so that may not always be possible. 1.33Mbps/s in the US likely doesn't put a dent in someone's 100Mbps or come near any cap, but elsewhere or in the cloud it may double someone's monthly cost.\n\nI think this stress test was really valuable.

You make some good arguments but I believe your logic is incomplete. Here are my major complaints:\n\nYour profitability charts are a mere 1 week each - surely you could have included several months instead of just 1 week. There are 3 stales combined in your charts, and I don't find this to be statistically significant. Mining is known to be very low margin, and you are arguing that in fact, it is not low margin and that even a few percentage points are not a big deal. I'm unconvinced, and I do believe that something as small as 2% would be make-or-break for some miners.\n\nYour simulations suggested that a 30% miner would find 30.3% of the blocks. 0.3% is fairly insignificant, but what's more significant is where that 0.3% is coming from. In a real network scenario, the miners that are the fewest hops from the 30% miner are going to have less stale blocks than the miners that are farther away. The further away miners are going to bear the brunt of this 0.3% gap. The effect is then compounded - not only is the big miner 1% more efficient (30% - > 30.3% is a 1% boost), but the furthest miner could be more than 1% less efficient.\n\nNow we're seeing a disparity of 2% between the big miner and the far-away small miner. This is out of the trivial range and into the potentially-damaging range.\n\nYou benchmarked that a fresh 20mb block would take around 20 seconds to verify. That's quite significant, especially considering we're looking at 20 seconds per hop. But was this just a block full of normal transactions, or was it a block taking advantage of the repeated-hashing attack you mentioned? Also (more of an aside), what hardware were you using? \n\nUnder normal, non-attack situations, I fully agree: the network is able to handle 20mb blocks and small miners will not be disadvantaged. But I think that you have overlooked the situation where large miners are intentionally trying to push small miners off of the network by creating slow blocks. I believe you have underestimated the effect of 20-second propagation time on disadvantaged miners, and I'm not certain you've benchmarked the worst-case-possible blocks. (intentionally designed to be as slow as possible).\n\nAt 20 seconds per hop, the miners that are 2 hops away are severely disadvantaged. Before migrating to 20mb blocks, you need to be certain that the farthest away miner will be mining on the slowest possible block after only 20-30 seconds. Even at 20-30 seconds, I believe we are in risky territory. (This is less significant if less than 33% of the blocks are attack-blocks).\n\nAttacks on Bitcoin should be so demonstrably worthless that they are not even worth attempting. I'm not convinced that 20mb attack-blocks are demonstrably not worth pursing to large miners.\n\nIt is worth adding that there's an opportunity cost to launching an attack-block. Attack-blocks will not have any transactions with fees in them. Today, that is not a very significant opportunity cost, and large blocks will keep the fee pressure low.

Right now we are only just approaching a stage where \'blockchain\' is entering the public lexicon , and that comes with a flimsy and imperfect understanding of the underlying ideas.\n\nThis is normal for emergent technologies. \n\nOne of the best parts about Bitcoin in my eyes is that any "missing the boat" opinions are missing the point. As a technology and a use system, Bitcoin compliments itself at every turn. As more coins enter the system and spread around, more people hear about it, more people use it, which increases value, which incites more curiosity, which disseminates the coins further, and on and on and on. \n\nAll things with time.

It is understandable that people at the time might have been apathetic or skeptical about the potential of the technology if they tried to envision the possibility of widespread adoption without the technology changing. Yet it was inevitable that the technology was going to evolve precisely because it solved a heretofore nonexistent problem, and having done so had to evolve in order to actualize its own intrinsic promise. It hadn\'t even occurred to people of the past that everyone on the planet could be connected informationally, yet once this was achieved in infancy, it had to play out to maturity.  \n\nPeople today thinking about Bitcoin face the same difficulty. To imagine widespread adoption one must also have an intuitive sense of how this technology will evolve and mature in the coming decades, without that vision it is hard to imagine how adoption of bitcoin can go beyond what it already is. Yet it is also clear that this technology must grow because it has, like the internet before, introduced a solution to a problem we didn\'t even know we had, it has let the cat out of the bag and there is no way to undo that. \n\nGreat technologies tend to solve problems that we didn\'t know we had until after they were already "solved". Search engines and the internet "solved" the problem of not having the world\'s database of information at our instant beck and call, but prior to their invention people didn\'t feel entitled to that kind of power and thus didn\'t perceive there to be a "problem". Far too often people tend to think of technology purely in terms of solving problems that are already clear, and that is the bulk of how technology progresses, but the great inventions are the ones that solve problems that only visionaries perceived. \n\nBitcoin is one such invention, in my view, it is the invention of direct digital ownership, a phenomena that neither existed in the past nor a "problem" perceived to be in desperate need of a solution. Nevertheless, it is a global record of ownership that is more direct, immediate, and binding than ownership guaranteed by law, and one that is global and not restricted by the borders of the nation state. Even if there was to be a global government it could not establish the kind of immediate ownership this technology brings. In effect, it flips the "virtual" space from being less real than meat space, to becoming more real. \n\nSince ownership is the foundation of money, and money the foundation of finance, it is all but inevitable, in my view, that direct digital ownership that is inherently superior to indirect legal ownership will come to represent the backbone of the global economic system, a system that ultimately depends upon confidence and is increasingly finding national borders to be more of a liability than an asset. The entire global financial system could become radically simplified and streamlined with a global ledger and direct ownership -- and the confidence these things bring -- at it core, bypassing the problems increasingly apparent as the global banking system buckles under the weight of the 21st century. The average citizen will be brought into this financial system as direct participants rather than 2nd class observers of it. The internet, the digital domain, could become the locus of legal and financial value and citizenship. Are we anywhere near that yet? No. But I can see it now whereas before Bitcoin I could not. Whether 20 years from now we will still refer to \'Bitcoin\' as at the heart of this technology I cannot say, but it is clear to me that this technology in general is huge, and since we have not even scratched the surface of its possible influence its clear to me that the answer is B.  \n\ntl;dr  --  B\n': 9, 'Tell that to goldman sachs who just invested 50 million into circle.
