B-money actually is probably the closest "idea" of a cryptocurrency in many ways to Satoshi\'s (in fact Satoshi says as much in emails to Wei Dai).

He goes further though:\n\n> \nAs I think I said in an earlier post you can mix currency systems, eg\nyou can use micropayment systems like say micromint, or millicent\nbacked with b-money, where the value is small enough that the\nrecipient is willing to take the risk of non-payment.  In Wei\'s\nprotocol description b-money is psuedonymous because the identities do\nnot have to be related to real world indentities.  You could also back\na chaumian ecash system with b-money, and perhaps in a way where the\nmint need not be trusted too much, by the value of circulating ecash\ncoins and b-money coins backing them could be openly auditable, or\nbetter that the opportunities for the mint to cheat were\ncryptographically restricted.\n\nNow this is interesting.

Because it seems the momentum for bitcoin as a currency is completely dead. There were two big mainstream players pushing services that allowed one to use bitcoin as a mainstream currency, Bitpay imploded early last year. Yes it's still around, but what's the growth of merchants? I remember it scaled from 10k merchants to 60k in two years, but today (a year later) still states it's at 60k merchants. There's no growth, they laid off a substantial portion of their team and reversed, within a year, the 'free forever' pricing model. All signs of no growth.

Always marketed itself as a consumer wallet (with an easy funding option) and a merchant payment processor... Now for the first time they're saying nah, we're first and foremost an exchange for (institutional) investors... a currency? No, it's an asset class in our view for now, that's where the market is. And they're not wrong and I don't blame them, they're following the demand. And the demand now clearly shows that the momentum for bitcoin as a currency is dead, and that it's mostly used as digital gold. That's still awesome and there's lots of interesting ways to use bitcoin to settle 'regular' financial transactions. But using bitcoin as a currency itself, rather than as infrastructure to move around value in other denominations (e.g. fiat to fiat in remittance), seems dead, and that's a shame. It may revive later, it's hard to build an industry with so few users. But seeing bitcoin as merely an investment isn't as appealing to me... and bitcoin merely as a settlement system, one which isn't anywhere as widely used or developed as using bitcoin for consumer purchases (which is small and sort of dead in and of itself) also doesn't seem to be taking off just yet.\n\nBlockchain.info is still a wallet, Circle is still a somewhat bitcoin-centric wallet, Bitpay is still around, and people still use Coinbase as a wallet... but I feel this is definitely some kind of a landmark shift by the biggest (and most universal) bitcoin company in the world: a shift towards a market where bitcoin is an asset class first and foremost.
