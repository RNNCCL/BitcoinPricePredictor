Even if we implement the secret vote for congress, eventually money would reverse that system overtime. However, James is not saying that implementing the secret vote would solve all problems or that it's the source of all human suffering. Obviously, the problem of money buying the system would remain. However, he is saying that open voting is responsible for the increased detorioration and for the steepness of the slope. \n\nWhich brings us to your second point. According to you, secret ballots would allow politicians to be bought without repercussions. I think the data provided in the video speaks otherwise. If secret ballots had no merit, the system would not have been implemented in the voting booth. Looking at the past and seeing how secret ballots improved the situation, I think the conclusion is that atleast in the case of regular voters, the system is superior. Now, it could be said that regular voters are not the same as politicians and that the dynamic works differently there. I think James has given indications that this is not the case. He's quoted several congressmen complaining how the sunshine laws have actually made it more difficult to vote, instead of improving the situation. \n\nOf course, these quotes may be but mere circumstancial evidence. However, I think it's clear that the supposed benefits of transparency simply aren't there as demonstrated through the Gilen flatline.

By your argument (to paraphrase, "the vital fact that allows politics to be coerced by money is the open ballot."  Let me propose two counterhypotheses:\n\n1) Money\'s influence on politics at some point simply coerced politicians into opening up the congressional vote process.  This would mean the voting\'s just a side-effect and incidental, not the root of problems.  (I find this to be very likely.)\n\n2) The influence money has over politics would continue to exist for other reasons (to name a few, human greed, the necessity of campaign funds, and logrolling).  If the ballot were secret, politicians could accept money without fear of reproach when their values are compromised.  (Less likely but possible.  I admit to the fact that I am not sure whether or not open voting is helpful democratically, but I suspect that it gives too much power to lobbyists.)\n\nThere is only one solution to the Gilens & Page problem, and it is to rectify the slope of that "elite" line.\n\nOn a side note, I find it slightly amusing that you say you see the Gilens & Page data as the first positive evidence for the libertarian hypothesis; I see it as just the opposite.  The Libertarian hypothesis is that "freedom is only obtained by internalizing the costs of social decisions to the individual."  What we see here is very close to that, and I could understand why you\'d slip up and see this as a validation of Libertarianism-- because what the Gilens data shows is that political influence is obtained by individuals who have internalized the costs of their social decisions (i.e. paid for legislation they wanted).  However, the conclusion of the Gilens paper is that this actually **decreases freedom at large.**  That\'s the opposite hypothesis of the Libertarian, who in theory says that everyone must pay for the things they want, because that is true freedom.\n\nMore simply, it can be thought of like this: imagine perfect Libertarianism implemented today.  These people who are economic elites have power now because they purchase legislation; those people would have power in a Libertarian society because they have the largest amount of resources and capital at their disposal already.  The fact that they currently use the government to enrich themselves is simply the work of rational actors acting in a free market, so to speak, where the market is the "funding-legislation" market, the same way they use their capital to enrich themselves (as mentioned by you relative to the Pickity stuff).': 5, 'Require secret ballots in congressional committees and on the floor.\n\nReforms in the 1970s introduced open voting, and James traces the rise in corruption to those reforms.\n\nThe idea is that open votes give financial backers, lobbyists, and party leaders a lever to coerce members.

Congress votes out in the open, so their votes are easy to buy since you can prove they voted the way you wanted them to.': 6, 'Let\'s say that I have a dog that barks all night; it keeps my neighbors up.  Now, normally, this means that I am infringing upon the freedom of my neighbors because I am imposing costs on them that I do not pay for.\n\nI now go around to each of my neighbors and pay them the amount that their frustration is worth.  If neighbor A is indifferent between hearing the dog bark and receiving $50, then I can pay him/her $50.  This is referred to as *internalizing* the cost.  Before I had paid, I was generating *external* costs.\n\nOnce I\'ve done this, presumably, there is no freedom sacrificed-- instead, I have paid the actual cost of my decision.\n\nUnder a Libertarian utopic society, all decisions work this way.  I am allowed, for example, to ban black people from entering my restaurant so long as I pay the cost of decreased business (slightly different from the dog example because you are denying goods to a consumer rather than paying for damages already done)-- or I can do all the drugs I want just as long as it only hurts my own body and doesn\'t cause damage to other individuals.\n\nHowever, a non-Libertarian approach to this recognizes that cost-internalization is ideal, not necessary.  For example, in the case of the restaraunt owner mentioned above, we in a democratic republic believe that it is okay to tell them: "you must accept black people in your restaraunt and treat them the same."  This is because while we see that the restaurant owner\'s freedom is decreased (by the amount relative to his desire to ban blacks), but we see the freedom of every black person in the United States increasing (by the amount relative to their desire to be able to enter any given restaurant without fear of segregation).  This consideration does not pay attention to the cost-externalization of the black people in question, because we have deemed that the costs being generated (the disutility of the restauranteer) should morally be dismissed.\n\nThis differs from the Libertarian interpretation, under which the costs generated by black people are actually immoral themselves; to tell the resteraunteer he cannot ban black people, under Libertarianism, is immoral because it forces him to accept external social costs.': 3, "Can you clarify that a bit (especially your last paragraph)?

The barrier to entry is set high, favouritism is strong and there is a vested interest to be dishonest. If Mastercoin, Etherium, Maidsafe's technologically is unsound, the devs will avoid at all cost admitting it has failed/has set backs/can't fulfill promise XYZ because they and others will be trying to protect their investment.\n\nOpen Transactions, Open Bazaar, Darkwallet, Sidechains, have no such investments where artificial monopolies are restricting who can reap the benefits (if it works then all Bitcoin users and even other alts benefit). If it fails or has problems devs will not be compelled to hide these problems because there is no subgroup they have to answer to or feel they've not met the expectations of that particular group. It's actually in the dev's best interest to be open/transparent/honest because this helps brainstorm solutions rather than hiding the problems for fear it's going to make them or the project look bad. Though it's incredibly unlikely, these projects have the option to fail and devs don't have to protect it from the possibility of failure, unlike Etherium, Maidsafe, Mastercoin etc. where they are going to have to answer people that paid them to make a successful product that they could profit from later.": 9, '2 years ago if someone told me that I would be LOL at your comment I would have told them they were crazy.': 0, "You could have just said you don't like them because they did crowd sales.\n\nAnyways, I disagree with almost every point you made regarding Ethereum, Maidsafe, and Mastercoin.

Any outside contribution will be absorbed, with almost zero benefit for others outside the Etherium investment crowd. Crowdfunding is only healthy if it doesn't impose barriers to entry or artificial monopolies. The problem, as I've already said, is that when you have a small group with vested interest in the success of the project, they will have a strong incentive to hide problems, make excuses for delays and do almost anything but admit they are experiencing problems. Tip4commit also highlights how money is a poor motivator in these circumstances, productivity is wasted where people are only there for the money and make it even harder for the project to grow because it is hindered by  those that have no interest in the project and will disappear the minute the money dries up. By imposing artificial monopolies it will only attract developers that have an interest in getting paid, and will drive away any other developers that wish to do it for free, or for the enjoyment/enthusiasm or passion of working on cryptocurrency. \n\nTell me, would you contribute to a company's software if you knew they were going to claim it as their own (and actively prevent you from using others contributions to that same software), sell it and share the profit with their shareholders and give you zero credit? I know though that gnu/linux contribution has made businesses from nothing, aided in nearly every facet of computing and is insumountably renound, yet no-one has shares, no-one who contributes is unrecognised, everyone gets to use what others have contributed, and everyone that works on linux is passionate about their work. Thats what a zero barrier to entry, zero monopoly project looks like. Even though they don't get paid, many more companies will pay them to contribute to the codebase because they know they'll collectively benefit from it. Already some core developers are employed by Bitcoin startups, and others have even gone on to create other Bitcoin related projects. \n\nYou need to remind yourself we are still in the innovator phase too, these things will take time. Crowdfunding simply gives you the feeling that progress is being made but it's almost always being done to feather the nests of a few, much like pre-order poison of ASIC mining, or IPO hypes on bitcoin stock sites. \n\nEd: Gmaxwell a Bitcoin core dev points out how tip4commit a service that pays people to contribute, has made [life much more difficult for actual developers](https://pay.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/2kzlsh/tip4commit_spammy_as_fuck/clq7fyn) that aren't there for the money as money motivated commiters send frivolous commits slowing down the review process, and will complain if their commits are somehow blocked from being added.": 1, 'Yeah...

Reason is that either 1)miners are not competive 2) miners have to run a full node on everything (does *not* solve the scalability problem for them) 3) miners use pools. Merged mining-on-all is a centralization risk!\n\nIn principle it is possible to do merged mining of some set limited number of chains. For instance you can be allowed to at maximum merged-mine two chains at a time, the nonce would simply list the chains. (not 100% sure how ASICs deal with that, think they can) *However*, then each chain gets much less difficulty, and if one miner 'owns'  a side chain, there are potentially lots of abuses.(well, i think that does depend on how the sidechain is implemented exactly)\n\n[This Ethereum blog post](https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/10/21/scalability-part-2-hypercubes/), the hypercube is just a particular chosen graph based on 3-way merged miners, each miner mines the main chain and two substates. There the suggested solution to lower difficulty on the substates is to tolerate them being owned by single miners, by having a mechanism where 'invalid portions can be reported' and a challenge mechanism to try ensure people can get at the data so they can find the portions that are invalid. If the attacker is forced to make valid blocks anyway, damage is basically completely avoided. He might be able to block transactions, but it is easy to add a mechanism to make transactions jump between substates, so attackers would have to attack all the substates at once to really succeed at blocking transactions.([might be inspired from my hanging blocks idea](http://o-jasper.github.io/blog/2014/06/03/hanging_blocks.html), but not sure.(edit:i am sure the idea already existed in some form) Using the before and after state is much nicer than what i propose there. I suppose i didnt have the Patricia Trie in my head well enough...)\n\nEdit: also the comparison with TCP/IP/HTTP... well bitcoin is a messy protocol, and people havent been able to duplicate it nearly well enough.(afaik the go version still doesnt work) Imo that takes on *too much* technical debt.(for instance the inputs/outputs thing, 'before and after balances' is better, Patricia tries better than that yet) I think existing holders is impetus behind this, but bitcoin technically itself deserves to be superceded, *not* extended/evolved.

A company decides to raise a specific amount of money to expand their operations, so they go through a process with investment bankers to secure the needed amount of money. The investment bank analysts probe the would-be investors to get an impression of what value they place on the stock, or in this case, a coin. This will change as the offering date approaches, sometimes higher or sometimes lower. They will know best a day or two before this ICO for the coin. Currently, GAW is being given data to indicate that the coin will go for \xe2\x80\x9cat minimum\xe2\x80\x9d $20.00 each to investors who have already shown interest to \xe2\x80\x9cbuy in.\xe2\x80\x9d\nI am basically curious how you guarantee this $20.00 price. Why $20.00 and $4.00 valuations?\nAnswer-1: $20.00 is not guaranteed, it is the minimum price that outside investors have agreed they would be willing to pay to invest in the coin. It is highly likely the coins market value, at sale time, will be higher than the $20.00 price. As the ICO date approaches, more valuations will be determined from further probing of the interested investor market.\nAnswer-2 (Allen): All of the ICO coins are apportioned based on the current investors\xe2\x80\x99 and banks\xe2\x80\x99 percentage of involvement up to this point. The remaining share of the ICO coins belong to GAW (and entities). This is a funding coin for GAW\xe2\x80\x99s business expansion projects as well. All involved entities have decided on the percentage of the ICO that will be sold to the miners. Any miner with Hashpoints will be able to purchase the coin with their Hashpoints.\nPrime owners also will have a continued role in the workings of the coin in the future. Therefore, it was agreed that the miners would be able to buy-in at the lower price, but that the coins would not be just given away without a reasonable value paid. Therefore, the value of $4.00 \xe2\x80\x9cor less\xe2\x80\x9d was decided, based on the number of Hashpoints estimated to be mined by the ICO date. As we approach the ICO date, that number will be solidified for the miners based on the total number of Hashpoints that have been mined by the date of the ICO.\nSo, that means every Hashpoint is worth $0.05?\nAnswer: No. They are currently worth $0.01. Since our miners will be able to purchase the coin at or below $4.00 (400 Hashpoints), the conversion will be based on a Hashpoint being worth $0.01 each. However, miners will have an immediate appreciation of value for the coins they buy based on the ICO\xe2\x80\x99s success. If the end price is $20.00 per coin for investors, then our miners will have earned prospectively 400% (or more) on their investment in each coin they have purchased with Hashpoints, once the initial offering has completed.\nThis is my concern. How do we ensure we get in?\nAnswer: It has already been arranged with the underwriting bank(s) and investors. All totaled Hashpoints represent a share of the entire pool of coins offered. Those miners who do not participate by purchasing the coin with their Hashpoints, will only be able to acquire the coin in the future through exchanges, or by mining the coin with Primes. Some miners may not want to use their Hashpoints to buy the coin, choosing instead to use their points to purchase AMPs for their Hashlets in the future.': -5, "There's victims then there's greedy idiots": 2, 'The Bitcoin tip for 50 bits has been collected by *rcondron*.\n\n\n[ChangeTip info](https://www.changetip.com/tip-online/reddit) | [ChangeTip video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AnfKpypMNw) | /r/Bitcoin': 1, 'Considering they convinced alot of the hashlet owners to get Hashpoints (Used to buy hashcoins) instead of their BTC payouts for 2 weeks I think GAW is making alot from it...\n\nit is considered a "great opportunity" for zencloud customers *facepalm*': 2, 'URL?': 1, '/u/changetip 50 bits': 2}, ("Have you ever seen a drunk man who doesn't know what Bitcoin is try to explain what Bitcoin is?
