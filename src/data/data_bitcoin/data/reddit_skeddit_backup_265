Nice and easy and slow for the non-blasphemers. \n\n1) A blockchain is a rather unwieldy data structure whose sole purpose is an unmutable open transaction record. That is the solution for trust without trusting humans. Humans can not be trusted.  \n\n2) A blockchain is a purely a transaction record.  The transactions are valid signatures by private keys to public addresses.  The notion of a coin or token springs from the transactions record.  There is no double entry ledger separate from the instrument itself as there is with bank currencies.\n\n3) Creating and maintaining this record is only trustworthy if it is exceedingly difficult for an actor or small group of colluding actors to modify the transaction record.\n\n4) To date only proof of work consensus systems are trustworthy. Any other consensus method is much more hackable.  Hackable meaning the ability to retroactively modify the transaction record.\n\n5) Proof of work is incented by the token having value. If the value of the token is not a voluntary market value but rather subsidized, then it is hackable by the subsidizing actor.  \n\n6) Despite hundreds, many brilliant, attempts to create voluntary priced alternatives, there is essentially zero success in creating ecosystems around any blockchains other than The Blockchain.\n\n7) There are no Goliath crypto coins.  Not even a single attempt at a marketable Krugman crypto coin, a jam it down your throat backed by men with guns coin.  It is plain that compulsion based value and open source crypto ledgers are incompatible.\n\n8) So, while "blockchain technologies" may prove valuable as a settlement record gadget, that is a trivial outcome.

The network is filled with spamming transactions and normal transaction have to wait hours to go through.

Who is atracking what?\n\nThe Bitcoin network is solid and working if the majority of the power calculation that must certify the blockchain is "honest" in the meaning it follows the rules every partecipant in the network expects. \n\nIf a "dishonest" subject reach the majority of the power calculation necessary to write the blockchain he can avoid the rules and certify transactions not normally valid among which also double spending transactions. He also can refuse blocks mined by other and do other thing which would destroy the credibility of the network.\n\n': 2, 'The 51% is well-known and is a mere Google search away, the malleability one (while also well known) can get confusing due to the jargon involved. Here\'s an ELI5.\n\nYou work in the Accounts department processing transparent envelopes with signed payment slips inside. If the signature is good then you enter it into your ledger and payment is made. On the outside of the envelope is a transaction identifier written in pencil. It has nothing to do with the payment slip inside, but is handy for locating envelopes. \n\nOne day you\'re asked to find an envelope with transaction id "abc123" but it\'s nowhere to be found. However, there is one with "def456" that matches the payment slip details exactly. You look very carefully and see that "abc123" has been rubbed out and replaced with "def456". Someone has been screwing with your system of finding envelopes. The payment is still signed correctly so you process it, but make a note to change your system of locating envelopes to avoid this in the future. Your new system relies on looking at the payment slip inside instead of relying on the transaction id outside.\n\nYou try to tell people to stop using the transaction identifier but it\'s just too damn handy so they ignore you.': 2, 'does it slow down transactions or?\n': 1, 'ohhh': 1, 'There are at least two "attacks" going on:\n\n**1. Transaction spam**\n\nSomeone creates a lot of junk transactions, to overload the network and mempools. These transactions may look like regular transactions and they are paying fees (roughly 0.00001 BTC/kB), potentially delaying legit transactions. This is somewhat costly for the attacker and mitigations to make it harder for the attacker are on the way (see [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6722) or [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6557)).\n\nUnfortunally the extra memory needed for these transactions appears to be an issue for some nodes. From an user\'s perspective it can likely be bypassed by paying higher fees than the attacker.\n\n**2. Transaction malleability**\n\nTo some degree miners and nodes can manipulate transactions they mine or see, without changing their validity. This is possible, because a signature only covers a transaction without signatures (otherwise it would cover itself, which isn\'t possible), and the signature itself can be represented in two forms. The attacker transforms signatures of bypassing transactions from one form into the other. As result, due to the change of the transaction, the hash of the transaction has changed, too. The hash of the transaction is used as quasi-identifier, namely the "txid", which can create the impression, depending on how a wallet or transaction explorer handles it, some transactions have disappeared, or were double spends. In the end it does no harm, because the "meaning" of the mutated transactions is the same (i.e. same inputs were spent, same destinations received the coins), but it creates a challenge for those who process transactions, like payment processors or [exchanges](https://twitter.com/cryptsy/status/651452139223519232), which may have trouble tracking the mutated transactions and relating them to the ones that made it into a block.\n\nA goal for some time is to avoid forms of malleability by restricting the potential forms of transactions, most notably here is [BIP 62](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0062.mediawiki). The ongoing mutations are not yet addressed on a larger scale of the network, which makes it very easy for the attacker. This is not because the "devs" are lazy, but rather because it\'s still an ongoing process.\n\nHowever: a few days ago a [patch was merged](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6769) into Bitcoin Core to accept only one signature form, and to reject the other. This is not a consensus rule, but a policy, to make it harder for the attacker. At the same time a counter-measure [has been started](http://bitcoinstats.com/irc/bitcoin-dev/logs/2015/10/08#l1444332212.0), to actively mutate transactions from the "wrong form" to the "accepted form" (some [more information](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1198032.msg12611204#msg12611204)), to reduce the success rate of the attacker even further.\n\nIt is likely that there is going to be new releases of Bitcoin Core [rather soon](http://bitcoinstats.com/irc/bitcoin-dev/logs/2015/10/08#l1444333303.0), to address these issues.': 6, '*dexX7* received a tip for 4,000 bits (4,000 bits/$0.98).\n\n\n\n\n--\n\n[^^what ^^is ^^ChangeTip?](https://www.reddit.com/r/changetip/wiki/tipping-on-reddit)': 1, "The impact is based on exploiting you not finding the transaction in question. \n\nFor example, imagine you're running a Bitcoin exchange.
