Since foreign currency reserves of a central bank is limited, once the reserves are depleted, the domestic currency will depreciate.\n\n>Hence, all three of the policy objectives mentioned above cannot be pursued simultaneously.

Here is the rest of relevant quotes:\n>    I think there is a good analogy to mathematical theories like, for example, \xe2\x80\x9cclass field theory\xe2\x80\x9d. In mathematics a set of axioms can be taken as a foundation and then an area for theoretical study is brought into being. For example, if one set of axioms is specified and accepted we have the theory of rings while if another set of axioms is the foundation we have the theory of Moufang loops.\n\n>    So, from a critical point of view, the theory of macro-economics of the Keynesians is like the theory of plane geometry without the axiom of Euclid that was classically called the \xe2\x80\x9cparallel postulate\xe2\x80\x9d. (It is an interesting fact in the history of science that there was a time, before the nineteenth century, when mathematicians were speculating that this axiom or postulate was not necessary, that it should be derivable from the others.)\n\n >   So I feel that the macroeconomics of the Keynesians is comparable to a scientific study of a mathematical area which is carried out with an insufficient set of axioms. And the result is analogous to the situation in plane geometry, the plane does not need to be really flat and the area within a circle can expand hyperbolically as a function of the radius rather than merely with the square of the radius. (This picture suggests the pattern of inflation that can result in a country, over extended time periods, when there is continually a certain amount of gradual inflation.)\n\n>    The missing axiom is simply an accepted axiom that the money being put into circulation by the central authorities should be so handled as to maintain, over long terms of time, a stable value.\n\nThx for commenting, gl with Ethereum!\n ": 3, 'The debate (block size) state rages on about the specific utility of bitcoin :) Depending on how the global economic system evolves your point may or may not hold true.': -1, 'In software development you have 4 dimensions: Speed, price, quality, and scope (i.e. feature set).': 1, 'John Nash\'s lecture "Ideal Money"\n\n>... if, for example, all of the countries of the world would base the value for their national currencies on the value of the British currency then this situation would appear singular and unstable, while it was not so singular for a lot of countries to base their currency value on gold.\n\n>But a modern alternative is possible, one that would provide a good standard independent of state pardoners.

That cost obviously grows with the number of such blocks, but not linearly; earlier blocks are much easier to re-sign than the most recent ones.\n\nIn theory, to do that, an attacker would need to purchase mining equipment and/or take control of some miners, until he had a comfortable majority (say, 60%) of all the active hashing power in the world.  The attacker would use that power to build a new branch of the chain, starting from the altered block.  The new branch would differ in some relevant transactions (e.g. substituting the hash of a deed for a different one, sending a payment to another address, etc.), but otherwise it would include the same transactions that were recorded in the original chain.   At some point the doctored branch would overtake the legitimate one, and then all bitcoin users, nodes, and miners would be bound to discard the latter and accept the doctored branch as legitimate.  \n\n(The doctoring of the blockchain would be obvious to everybody, but the players cannot reject the longer chain since that would require some central authority to "disqualify" it -- and the only reason for bitcoin to exist is that it has no central authority.)\n\nThe total hashing power of the network now is 300\'000 trillion hashes per second (TH/s).  I don\'t know much about mining equipment, but it seems that a machine capable of 1 TH/s costs less than 1000 USD.  So, buying enough new equipment to launch a majority attack should cost less than 500 million USD. Once the equipment is set up in a place with cheap electricity, running it should cost less than a million dollars a day.  The equipment would have to be kept running for twice as long as the age of the block to be doctored. That is: if the hash of a land deed was included in the blockchain one week before the attack started, an attacker whose goal was to replace that hash would have to keep the machines running for about 2 weeks to catch up with the legitimate chain.  That would cost him about 14 million dollars of electricity and other expenses.  Since earlier blocks are much cheaper to re-sign, I would guess that an attacker could doctor any block, no matter how old, with less than 1 billion dollars of total expenses and 1 year of work.\n\nAcquiring 60% of the existing installations should cost a lot less than that, perhaps 200 million or less.  Renting them may cost as little as 500\'000 USD/day, electricity included, and no capital costs.\n\nThat said, I don\'t quite see why the cost of drilling through a safe box should be comparable to the value that one keeps in it.

Almost all software (besides Bitcoin Core 0.9.5 and later) will accept these invalid blocks under certain conditions. The paragraphs that follow explain the cause more throughly.\nFor several months, an increasing amount of mining hash rate has been signaling its intent to begin enforcing BIP66 strict DER signatures. As part of the BIP66 rules, once 950 of the last 1,000 blocks were version 3 (v3) blocks, all upgraded miners would reject version 2 (v2) blocks.\nEarly morning UTC on 4 July 2015, the 950/1000 (95%) threshold was reached. Shortly thereafter, a small miner (part of the non-upgraded 5%) mined an invalid block--as was an expected occurrence. Unfortunately, it turned out that roughly half the network hash rate was mining without fully validating blocks (called SPV mining), and built new blocks on top of that invalid block.\nNote that the roughly 50% of the network that was SPV mining had explicitly indicated that they would enforce the BIP66 rules. By not doing so, several large miners have lost over $50,000 dollars worth of mining income so far.\nAll software that assumes blocks are valid (because invalid blocks cost miners money) is at risk of showing transactions as confirmed when they really aren't. This particularly affects lightweight (SPV) wallets and software such as old versions of Bitcoin Core which have been downgraded to SPV-level security by the new BIP66 consensus rules.\nThe immediate fix, which is well underway as of this writing, is to get all miners off of SPV mining and back to full validation (at least temporarily). As this progresses, we will reduce our current recommendation of waiting 30 extra confirmations to a lower number.\n\nI'll try and break it down for you\n\n>For several months, an increasing amount of mining hash rate has been signaling its intent to begin enforcing BIP66 strict DER signatures. As part of the BIP66 rules, once 950 of the last 1,000 blocks were version 3 (v3) blocks, all upgraded miners would reject version 2 (v2) blocks.\n\nThis new rule - strict DER signature enforcement - was being deployed when a certain number of miners signaled they were supporting it. This is pretty standard stuff when deploying new software for bitcoin\n\n>Early morning UTC on 4 July 2015, the 950/1000 (95%) threshold was reached. Shortly thereafter, a small miner (part of the non-upgraded 5%) mined an invalid block--as was an expected occurrence. Unfortunately, it turned out that roughly half the network hash rate was mining without fully validating blocks (called SPV mining), and built new blocks on top of that invalid block.\n\nWhat this means is a miner with ~5% of the hash power got lucky and found a block. The miner propagated this block to the rest of the network to receive his 25 BTC reward. Since other miners were acting as SPV miners (not actually checking the miners work, taking their word that they actually found the correct block) other miners began mining the new block that this miner found. \n\n>Note that the roughly 50% of the network that was SPV mining had explicitly indicated that they would enforce the BIP66 rules.

The scale effect of legalizing prostitution, i.e. expansion of the market, outweighs the substitution effect, where legal sex workers are favored over illegal workers. On average, countries with legalized prostitution report a greater incidence of human trafficking inflows. \n\n> * The effect of legal prostitution on human trafficking inflows is stronger in high-income countries than middle-income countries. Because trafficking for the purpose of sexual exploitation requires that clients in a potential destination country have sufficient purchasing power, domestic supply acts as a constraint. \n\n> * Criminalization of prostitution in Sweden resulted in the shrinking of the prostitution market and the decline of human trafficking inflows. Cross-country comparisons of Sweden with Denmark (where prostitution is decriminalized) and Germany (expanded legalization of prostitution) are consistent with the quantitative analysis, showing that trafficking inflows decreased with criminalization and increased with legalization. \n\n> * The type of legalization of prostitution does not matter \xe2\x80\x94 it only matters whether prostitution is legal or not. Whether third-party involvement (persons who facilitate the prostitution businesses, i.e, \xe2\x80\x9cpimps\xe2\x80\x9d) is allowed or not does not have an effect on human trafficking inflows into a country. Legalization of prostitution itself is more important in explaining human trafficking than the type of legalization. \n\n> * Democracies have a higher probability of increased human-trafficking inflows than non-democratic countries. There is a 13.4% higher probability of receiving higher inflows in a democratic country than otherwise.\n\nAnd I would say sex trafficking requires someone to sell the people which is a reasonable definition of pimp.": 1, "Are you saying that I don't have to send my BTC to Shapeshift, convert them to Darkcoins (Dash now), cycle them, send them to Cryptsy, convert them back to BTC, send them to my fake account at Bitstamp, then send them to my wallet before spending them? :D\n": 2, "> cause psychological torment in many if not all cases.\n\nApart from the fact that *life* causes psychological torment, I really can't agree.": 3, 'Yes but needs to be more accessible': 1, 'I would assume Google Voice/Skype or other voip solutions which will forward calls.': 2, 'Bro, read the link.
