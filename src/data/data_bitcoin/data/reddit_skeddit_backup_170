Since soft forks are easy to do, why not bring down the block size in the next point release to 100 KB? According to Pieter that\'s fine. It is very convenient to Core devs to spread FUD about hard forks and use soft forks to sneak in stuff because it is "easy" and "secure" to do.': -1, "Very, very common view.

We can certainly - individually or not - propose solutions, and express opinions, but as far as maintainers of the software goes our responsibility is keeping the system running, and risking either a fork or establishing ourselves as the de-facto central bank that can make any change to the system would greatly undermine the system's value.\n\n>Hard forking changes require that ultimately every participant in the system adopts the new rules. I find it immoral and dangerous to merge such a change without extremely widespread agreement. I am personally fine with a short-term small block size bump to kick the can down the road if that is what the ecosystem desires, but I can only agree with merging it in Core if I'm convinced that there is no strong opposition to it from others.\n\n>Soft forks on the other hand only require a majority of miners to accept them, and everyone else can upgrade at their leisure or not at all. Yes, old full nodes after a soft fork are not able to fully validate the rules new miners enforce anymore, but they do still verify the rules that their operators opted to enforce. Furthermore, they can't be prevented. For that reason, I've proposed, and am working hard, on an approach that includes Segregated Witness as a first step.

I understand that. It\'s a big responsibility. What if something goes wrong? But I\'m afraid that responsibility is there now, like it or not. And not acting is a choice just like acting.

Btw. this has been pointed a lot to the Bitcoin Core "consensus mechanism" and there never has been a proper response. In fact, there now is a response:\n\nIt seems like the idea is to construct complex solutions that may not get overall consensus but that can be pushed via a soft fork, and then clean them up later via a hard fork.

Seriously, to maintain a computer over several years (bitcoin has been around since 2009!) means periodically upgrading both the hardware and software.  3 - 5 years is about what you could expect as a reasonable lifespan.  If you upgrade OS you well may need to upgrade hardware at some point - same with running a node.

I love bitcoin, and think it has immense power to disrupt how the economy works today and giving people opportunities they didn't have before (the leading cause of inequality and indirectly poverty), but some of the concepts of the bitcoin community exhibit great misunderstanding of basic economics and will only cause greater poverty and inequality. Yeah, holding bitcoin could theoretically leave you better off because its fixed in supply, but in the end its at the expense of growth in the economy. Using bitcoin is great, but if you own it and it sits there, its making the economy worse off. However, **THIS DOES NOT MEAN YOU NEED TO SPEND IT**, simply loaning it to a friend who is starting a business, buying a miner with it (I know you're spending but in the end it produces bitcoin for you), loaning it on bitfinex, all are forms of investment that help the economy grow, give people access to output producing capital they didn't have before, and makes everyone better off.": -1, 'I agree with many of your points, especially the "STUFF based society." A common misconception is that economists say consumption is necessary for the economy to be healthy, but that\'s not the case. Economic production is caused by consumption sure, but also by import/exports and investment (consider an economy where the gov\'t doesn\'t exist or gov\'t purchases are allocated to either consumption or investment), and the big thing is consumption only benefits the economy once, when money is spent, while investment continues to help the economy grow in the long term. But consumption is easier to control, so it quickly becomes the target of manipulation by economists in order to boost the economy, even if its not the best way to do so. As for your investments, over the past 49 years investments in general have appreciated very much, which is why a passive approach of index investing is commonly suggested now a days. By doing so you essentially peg your money to the growth of the economy, which has been impressive for the past century. As for bitcoin, it could be wise investment too, but obviously we can\'t really know for sure until after it has performed as a nice investment (isn\'t that just unfortunate haha) and it could also redefine the economy, but one things for sure, if people hoard their bitcoin en masse (i.e. not say us bitcoiners holding a relatively small amount or people holding but loaning it out or investing in capital markets) it won\'t be beneficial for society as a whole.': 0, "Are you feeling confident enough that government wouldn't find out about you evading taxes?

Presumably, censorship in this context is simply the ability to prevent payments to or from a particular person... but for a bank, that just means not paying someone or freezing any funds that it receives from that person. Those are easy -- it is nothing more than blacklisting. In fact, it would be more difficult in a global private chain, because participant banks might unwittingly process a payment or otherwise validate a payment by another bank subject to some form of censorship (big liability risk for participants).\n\n"Roll back" (by which I assume you mean reversing transactions). Important to remember that transactions today can only be reversed for a limited period of time (we have settlement finality rules -- we do not have a rule that says TXs need to be reversible for x period of time). After that, the only way to reverse transactions is with the consent of all parties ("consent" may be required, for example following a court order in the event of an insolvency), which is frequently what happens.

Even with a 1% advantage (seemingly small), on a long enough timeline, the compounding effects of that 1% could be massive. We don\'t know how this will effect centralization in the long run, and once it\'s released, we can\'t say "oops" and go back to 1mb. So, keep 1mb until we can solve the centralization problem (or raise the limit in lockstep with global bandwidth increases).\n\n(That\'s just one of multiple arguments for small blocks).\n\nNote that I personally think that we should raise the limit in the short term, but with an absolute maximum of 8mb until we have time to evaluate how the network reacts.
