We\'ve carefully done this in a way that doesn\'t give up the security model we value.

This is the ONLY way to recover your wallet (no email/phone verification or HD seed) Second, it is annoying to login to the wallet with my password everytime I open the app. The password is 12 char minimum with special char and numbers (i think) and it is annoying to type in everytime you open the wallet portion of the app. Fingerprint and/or passcode unlock should be implemented. Third is the ability to import private keys and have watch only addresses. Overall it is a decent wallet (allows export private keys and also has a neat feature ,something i wish more wallets implemented, and that is the ability to scan a qr code from a picture). The best feature is the merchant directory, and it is nice to see my business on the first page :)\n\nEdit: i know that you can change the auto log off to up to 60 days and you're still protected with your withdrawal pin but i think the pin to unlock the wallet is a better/less confusing implementation.

Hmmm... This is unheard of. Probably you will get better response if you post this in its own thread. I am by no means expert so I might be wrong on some account but I will attempt to address some of the key things.\n\n>My understanding is that Electrum employs, or will employ, invertible bloom filters \n\nNope, Electrum employs Bloom Filter. Invertible Bloom Filter is the one being used to eliminate the needs for full node to download whole block everytime miner find a new block by 'guessing' which transaction is inside the block based on block headers and transaction that are already inside the mempool. This feature is not yet implemented in Bitcoin Core.\n\n>However, SPV clients must query the balances of the addresses they contain. Electrum communicates with Electrum servers to confirm those balances before sending, because the blockchain isn't stored locally.\n\nNope, rather than querying the balances SPV clients query transaction. Think of it this way. The way Bitcoin works is that everytime you receive a payment you receive single 'dollar bill' with 'serial number' attached to it. When you make a payment you need to refer to this 'serial number'. If you don't store the whole blockchain you may not know what is the 'serial number' of the 'dollar bills' that you have.\n\nWhat the Bloom filter does is that it attempt to ask the Electrum server to pass only the transaction with serial number that is relevant to you. Of course you will need to pass some of the 'fake' request as well to attempt to protect your privacy (which the Bloom filter also provides).\n\nYou can refer to BIP37 by Mike Hearn for more details:\n\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0037.mediawiki": 2, 'I called it that for a long while.

HD wallets aren't really being used in this way (giving untrusted parties master public keys to an account so they can track the addresses but not spend from it) yet so it's not too big a deal, but it is a problem if we do start using them that way.

A radical new financial order would her, otherwise threatened the destruction of our prosperity.\n> \n> We live in a time when a financial crisis the next hunt. Central banks print more and more money, inflation rises. But through the many notes form price bubbles - bubbles that burst at some point. The result: a serious crisis. The supposed solution: more cheap money. And voil\xc3\xa0, the vicious cycle begins again.\n> \n> In his new book "The New Rules of Money - Why we need monetary reform" the Ex-top banker Thomas Mayer deals with exactly this devilish spiral and crisis calls for a radical new beginning.\n> \n> Paper money and socialism lead to ruin\n> \n> In his opinion, our current paper money system is to blame for the misery. Or rather, it is the central banks and banks that make more and more money out of nothing and so the stem a crisis so that they create another. This leads over time to a society\'s need for stability, so Mayer in an interview with " Business Week ". States would serve this need then by intervened in the economy and capitalism gradually transferred into a socialist economic system in this way.\n> \n> And so we would, according to Mayer exactly at that point, or that "ism", the liberal economist has always been the fear teaches socialism. Mayer also can be the mantra \xc3\xa0 la Friedrich von Hayek not escape and speaks of socialism that destroyed the prosperity and inevitably leads to slavery. And because the paper money in turn is just the beginning, socialism at the end of this fatal chain of causation is for Mayer clearly: "Because socialism leads to destruction, is the credit system that promoted socialism, dangerous." It is high time rumzurei\xc3\x9fen the helm and to preserve us from destruction. Mayer has also directly ready for a proposed solution: A new monetary system must be found.\n> \n> Active money is credit money to replace\n> \n> Mayer argues in favor of replacing the current credit money through "active money". Active money? "Money does not materialize, in contrast to loan money through a debt ratio, but is based on an asset, says former chief economist at Deutsche Bank. The point of this money system: The money can not be increased. Banks and States is that everyone access to the creation of new money withdrawn as " Der Spiegel notes ". Instead, the central bank in Mayers active monetary system the money directly to the citizens. Money that they do not any prints, but produces "public confidence in the money" by. How this would work exactly, it goes Mayer in the interview with the "Business Week" is not a closer. However, it is essential that people between different currencies could choose. This competition of currencies would put any issuer, such as the ECB limits and thus ensure that not too much money is spent. The radical liberalism of the "Austrian School of Economics" Greetings.\n> \n> For the banks, it gets back to basics\n> \n> And the banks? The recall in this scenario back on their core tasks, namely the securing of deposits and mediating between savers and investors. Where: A business credit can only come about if all loans are fully cover through savings. For loans from which to draw nothing, these times would be pass\xc3\xa9.\n> \n> Bitcoin Euro instead?\n> \n> So far, so good. But how should this new active money actually look like? According to Mayer, it may well also have a virtual character. Specifically, he cites the example of Bitcoin. Raises the digital currency so soon from the Euro? Not necessarily. According to Mayer of the euro need not necessarily disappear, especially since the active monetary system offering especially for the euro zone, because it was working completely without a state. Mayer\'s judgment: "Should the euro survive, he must be repositioned as active money. As a passive money he is doomed to failure. "\n> \n> If you believe his statements, it is not just the euro, but we are all doomed. Namely, if we do not use the financial crisis as a "chance of the century", "to replace our dysfunctional monetary system by a better one." Otherwise, we will stagger from the financial crisis in the money crisis and destroy the foundations of our prosperity, warns Mayer.

Please.', 19): {'Here\'s my ELI5 explanation of sidechains. (Disclaimer: I\'m an independent researcher, not an employee or consultant of BlockStream).\n\nLet\'s say you wanted to have a club (or a company, or some other name for an organization) that performs a variety of functions. It has an bake sale, a raffle, does some donations at the end of the year. Maybe it also has an internal "club tokens" currency which can be passed around and maybe can be used as discounts.\n\nThis club could maintain a little warchest of Bitcoins. These Bitcoins would come in handy for carrying out the club\'s functions. The club\'s bake sale might accept Bitcoin payments at its bake sale - proceeds go directly into the club fund. At the raffle, one of the prizes might include a few Bitcoins taken from that fund. The club might use its Bitcoin fund to match donations from its members. \n\nComplementary currencies like the "club tokens" are economic experiments of their own - no hard and fast rules how to manage them. One (plausible) way get the club tokens to take off (to the moon!) is to set a "floor" value for them - if you have a token, you can sell it back to the club for 10 millibits (at least as long as there\'s enough btc in the club\'s fund to cover it). A portion of the club\'s fund might be set aside for this (to prevent defaulting if everyone sells their tokens back at once). Hopefully the tokens end up with a *higher* value than 10 millibits, but setting a floor value is thought to bolster consumer confidence.\n\nAll of these are things you could do with Bitcoin today, without needing sidechains.... but the club would have to have an officer (a Treasurer) who oversees the Bitcoin fund and is trusted not to embezzle from it!\n\nSuppose instead of having a trusted treasury officer, you wanted to run your club on a public proof-of-work blockchain of its own. You would start by writing down the club\'s operating rules in a computer-readable programming language. You might think the next step is to fork bitcoind and launch your blockchain as an altcoin. But how would the Bitcoin fund work?\n\nIn the version with the treasury officer, the officer kept track of the private keys that lets him move Bitcoins around on behalf of the club. But a public proof-of-work blockchain has no private key.... the closest thing it has is its proof-of-work chain itself, which functions a bit like a signature.\n\nIn Bitcoin today, the only way you can store bitcoins is if you know a secret key corresponding to your address. Sidechains lets an altcoin have its own Bitcoin account. Instead of using its secret key to sign transactions, it moves bitcoins around by building proof-of-work. ***The "address" of a sidechain is its genesis block, and the "signature" of a sidechain is a long proof-of-work chain extending from its genesis block.***\n\n\nNote about the phrase "2-way peg":\nI hope this explanation was helpful, especially the examples of things that a club (or altcoin) might do with a Bitcoin fund. The paper refers to this overall technique as "2-way peg", which suggests that the main intended use is to have an altcoin currency that\'s backed-by-and-denominated-in Bitcoins. Even though the club in my example has a club tokens currency, it\'s not integral to the club\'s functions and I didn\'t suggest that the club should sell its club tokens for Bitcoins or denominate them in Bitcoins. (The "floor value" in my example could be described as 1-way peg). Having a 2-way pegged currency is for sure possible, but not the only thing you can do with the sidechains technique. So, overall I prefer thinking of this as a way for an altcoin to have its own Bitcoin account or treasury fund.': 3, "Could this be used in existing fiat systems for record keeping? For instance I have a point of sale in a retail shop, I want it to record all transactions onto the blockchain, allowing my customers to have a digital receipt, as well as the company to automate accounting?
