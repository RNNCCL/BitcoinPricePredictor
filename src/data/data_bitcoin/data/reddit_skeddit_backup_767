People and Govts can buy the exactly the same amount of stuff, and it is the amount of stuff that matters.  This part of his argument is a simple fallacy.  \n\nThe problem with deflation is that people do not readily accept apparently falling wages, even though their real wages (and the amount of stuff they can buy) may be constant because the prices of stuff is also falling.  So they resist (apparently) falling wages.  Sticky prices.  This causes (by simple logic) unemployment and recession.  If it persists, and people don't change the way they approach these things, it can cause permanent depression.

The problem of distributed consensus is formalized in the [Byzantine Generals Problem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault_tolerance).\n\nTo explain the problem in layman\'s terms:  If we want to have a global public ledger where everyone maintains a copy and everyone agrees, then how do we handle disputes?  What if I install Bitcoin, and connect to some nodes who are each telling me conflicting information about the state of the ledger - who do I believe?  We can\'t just agree by counting the number of votes from peers, because on the internet it\'s easy for one person to create millions of nodes to rig the vote (called a Sybil attack).  Also we can\'t just trust our friends because then we build a giant web-of-trust that can easily fragment into disagreeing segments.  Satoshi gave us the solution for building a distributed, trustless, irrefutable global ledger where everyone and anyone could participate and easily form consensus with one another - even newcomers who never saw what happened in the past can arrive on the network and know with a high degree of confidence what the entire history of the ledger is.\n\nThe way that this consensus is formed is through proof-of-work, and you really need to read Satoshi\'s paper to appreciate it.  Basically, proof-of-work means that I can send you a piece of data, and you can look at it and easily prove mathematically that a certain amount of "work" has been spent to produce that data.  What is "work"?  It means computational work, so someone has burnt CPU cycles (or GPU or ASIC cycles) to produce that data, and you don\'t have to take their word for it, because you can see it in the data itself.  Why is that useful?  Because work is naturally rate limited.  We don\'t have unlimited computational resources.  If the bitcoin network is burning 300 Petahash of computing power to produce new blocks, your little ARM CPU on your phone can mathemtically verify that instantly with a few quick calculations, so you know that the ledger you are seeing was produced by millions of dollars worth of equipment.  If an attacker wants to fool you, they better start producing millions of dollars worth of hardware to do it.\n\nThe brilliant thing about "mining" is that it combines the proof-of-work security with an incentive model (newly generated coins + fees) and has one simple rule: the longest chain (chain with the most work) is the true chain.   So this provides an incentive for everyone to work together to build the longest chain, which means that an attacker has to gain 51% of the network\'s hash power if they want to produce the longest chain.': 10, 'Pages 162-165 in this book give a fun explanation.

It's not strictly necessary in order to process transactions.  The algorithm performs no useful work or specific task.  It's just a pointless game that determines the distribution of new Bitcoins.\n\nIn another sense, mining is essential.  It keeps the network decentralized.  It provides an alternative price signal by tying Bitcoin to the costs of energy and high-tech manufacturing.  It enables bootstrapping and growth without centralized control.  It protects the network from outside interference.

The more work has gone into making the carpet longer, the harder it becomes to just present a longer carpet other will accept. You need to invest the same amount of work in total as has gone into the original carpet. The carpet allows to look up any past and present funds and their position. Mining is essentialy just that, weaving the carpet. This weaving is payed by subsideries and transaction fees. The subsideries follow the extraction curve of precious metals hence the name mining.\n\nI think the explanation above is excellent.

The trick is that it is very hard to add the new page.  You simply write new transactions but you also need to win a lottery sort of - for your page to be correct. So it takes long to make/find the new page which is correct (only 1 miner is lucky in the whole world every 10 minutes), then this new page is sent to all other nodes in the Bitcoin network (this takes less time - seconds).

Electrum and multibit are lightweight clients and don't require that.\n\nAlso for more security look into [cold storage](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQ7a-WZzJas) and [paper wallets](https://www.bitaddress.org).  Also find out about hardware wallets like [Trezor](https://www.buytrezor.com/) which keep your keys safe on an external device, but still allow you to spend from them.  \n\nThere are mobile wallets too. [This](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.schildbach.wallet) wallet is pretty good for Android, and [bread wallet](http://app.breadwallet.com/) is good for i-phone.  [Mycelium](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mycelium.wallet) also seems widely recommended, and I hear it has a local trader option as well to find people to buy and sell bitcoins in your area..  Hopefully some of these links will help you out.\n\nFor tipping, you can tip on reddit using /u/changetip and then specify the amount.  Just link your reddit account on changetip.com and it will automatically collect any tips you receive.  Then you can send your bitcoin from changetip to another wallet if you wish.\n\nYou can also tip on Twitter and Youtube, and soon more places as well.\n\n200 bits /u/changetip": 4, "\xc2\xaf\\(\xc2\xba\xd0\xb4\xe0\xb2\xa0)/\xc2\xaf Wait a minute!
