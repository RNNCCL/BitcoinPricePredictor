While some state and federal candidates in California, Colorado, New Hampshire and elsewhere have started accepting Bitcoins, Mr. Paul, a Republican, is the first presidential candidate to do so.\n\nThe novelty of the payment method is likely to help Mr. Paul highlight his edgy appeal to other libertarians, tech-savvy voters, young people and others who favor Bitcoin. But it also raises questions about whether illegal contributions could make their way into campaigns more easily.\n\nThe Bitcoin itself is essentially untraceable if the owner wants to maintain anonymity, and political candidates who accept them must rely largely on donors\xe2\x80\x99 disclosing their identity.\n\nFederal law bans contributions to individual candidates from foreigners, corporations or straw donors, among other restrictions, and campaigns are expected to make their \xe2\x80\x9cbest efforts\xe2\x80\x9d to collect and publicly identify donors who contribute more than $200 in a year and to detect contributions that may be illegal.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt some level, we are trusting candidates,\xe2\x80\x9d said Richard L. Hasen, a campaign finance expert at the University of California, Irvine School of Law. The system already relies on some measure of trust from candidates, he said, \xe2\x80\x9cbut the difference with Bitcoin is that it is inherently untraceable.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIn a ruling last year, the Federal Election Commissionagreed to allow a political action committee to accept Bitcoins with a voluntary limit of $100, but the commissioners split over how the online currency \xe2\x80\x94 which can fluctuate widely in value \xe2\x80\x94 should be treated on a broader scale or whether it should be capped.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBitcoins are no more anonymous than any other contribution,\xe2\x80\x9d wrote Lee E. Goodman, a Republican commissioner who was then the chairman of the panel. He said that technological innovations should be embraced in the political system and that Bitcoins should be treated no differently than a computer, securities, a painting or other legal, \xe2\x80\x9cin-kind\xe2\x80\x9d contributions.\n\nBut the three Democratic commissioners \xe2\x80\x94 Ann M. Ravel, Steven T. Walther and Ellen L. Weintraub \xe2\x80\x94 were much more cautious in endorsing the limited use of Bitcoins.\n\nBitcoins should be treated the same as cash, with a cap of $100, to protect against unethical and illegal activities, the three commissioners wrote. \xe2\x80\x9cThe fact that Bitcoins are ultimately untraceable makes prophylactic measures at the outset of the transaction particularly important,\xe2\x80\x9d they said. The commission did not adopt the cap.\n\nFor Mr. Paul, who has been sharply critical of the government\xe2\x80\x99s electronic surveillance programs as an attack on privacy, his embrace of Bitcoins \xe2\x80\x93 with their added layers of privacy \xe2\x80\x93 is a way to establish his bona fides with younger voters who put a premium on Internet freedom and technology.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSenator Paul will run the most tech innovative campaign in 2016,\xe2\x80\x9d a spokesman, Sergio Gor, said when asked about the decision to accept the digital currency. \xe2\x80\x9cFrom Snapchat to Bitcoin, we\xe2\x80\x99ll engage in various forums before anyone else.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is certainly new territory,\xe2\x80\x9d said David Mitrani, a Washington lawyer who specializes in campaign finance law and has represented several candidates who have accepted Bitcoins.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is traceable, but only if the campaign follows the strict instructions that were given by the commission\xe2\x80\x9d for identifying the donor, he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIf a committee doesn\xe2\x80\x99t implement these strict measures, there\xe2\x80\x99s certainly a concern.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\nAs an experiment, Mr. Mitrani tried to make an online donation of more than $200 in Bitcoins on Mr. Paul\xe2\x80\x99s campaign website \xe2\x80\x94 above the voluntary limit that his campaign placed on Bitcoin donations.\n\n\n\nThe donation was rejected. \xe2\x80\x9cBitcoin donations are limited to $100,\xe2\x80\x9d the automated response said. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you would like to contribute more than $100, you may select Credit Card as your payment option and contribute up to $2,600 for the primary election and up to $2,600 for the general election.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRepresentative Jared Polis, Democrat of Colorado, became the first member of Congress to accept Bitcoins as donations last year.\n\nMr. Polis said he collected $1,986 in Bitcoins, a tiny fraction of the nearly $1.2 million he raised over all in his 2014 re-election. He said Bitcoins were not only a way to give people another way to donate, but also to show his support for Internet freedom, a cause he has championed.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s no riskier than any other kind of contribution,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\nBitcoin enthusiasts predicted that Mr. Paul would be the first of many presidential candidates to rake in Bitcoins.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s at the forefront of a tech revolution, like the first candidates to have websites,\xe2\x80\x9d said Brian Klein, a Los Angeles lawyer and a Bitcoin supporter who has represented many clients involved in the currency.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI bet other presidential candidates will follow his lead, and soon,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Klein said. \xe2\x80\x9cI also believe in a year or two, this won\xe2\x80\x99t be a story because every candidate will accept Bitcoins \xe2\x80\x94 just like every candidate has a website.\xe2\x80\x9d': 3, 'Lost it here:\n\n>The Bitcoin itself is essentially untraceable\n\nand then it gets better:\n\n>"but the difference with Bitcoin is that it is inherently untraceable.\xe2\x80\x9d\n': 5, 'doh!': 1, 'Got it.

(Maybe that\'s why Proof of Stake coins appeal to some people.)  So instead of realizing \'hey I have too much bitcoin, I need to have my assets be more productive\' and sell a little or all, they instead double-down on the risk of having no bitcoins by gambling or investing in wild eyed Ponzis funded by bitcoin. It\'s better sometimes to just keep your cool and not get in deeper or over your head when it comes to owning bitcoin.\n\nIdeally, you could be like the investors of bitcoin businesses which are hoping to fund operations and grow - not that they have it easy - but being able to invest in BitPay would be *safer* than the all-or-nothing bet on bitcoin (for example) and even BitPay struggles (I think I remember there were some layoffs and the football game is not a bitcoin game anymore).\n\nI still think bitcoin is pretty cool but it\'s going to be a LONG hard road. It\'s not the easiest thing for people to understand and that slows adoption.... but it\'s still the biggest cryptocurrency out there, and I think that the \'network effect\' is going to make it the leader for a long long time.\n\n2) stealing bitcoin ... yes your security concerns are going to have to be at the max with bitcoin. In the conventional world of security, confidentiality failures (like having your email password stolen, having identity theft abused to take out loans or IRS refunds or some kind of scammy medical billing) can be dealt with by the long legal means and risk assessments that have safety netted the whole propped up mess. But with bitcoin, you are alone going to have to keep confidential things (bitcoin private addresses) completely secret. If your computer is compromised, and that\'s where you store bitcoins, you could be wiped out.\n\nThe FDIC insurance is currently paid for by everyone that pays taxes. It\'s not big enough to cover a total system failure. It\'s very effective. Capital requirements for banks make it mostly unnecessary. If a bank goes under by being over-leveraged it can be closed on a Friday and flipped to a new owner and open on Monday. The biggest banks, like Goldman Sachs, go basically insolvent and get bailed out by the regional Federal Reserve of New York as the people in government, Goldman Sachs, and the Federal Reserve work together to keep themselves solvent, which they can do because they control the whole financial system of dollars. Not a conspiracy, just reality. FDIC deposits are "safe" but it\'s all imaginary dollar numbers. But it\'s an illusion that enough people buy into that the currency stays afloat and a lot of people measure value denominated in it. So it\'s trustworthy-ish. :)\n\nEDIT: tinfoil hat, obviously dollars are fine.

Bitcoin miners depend on the hashing power of thousands of individuals.
