Just write down your 12 word seed for backup.\n\nAnother option is [multibit](https://multibit.org/). Also you can try [Bitcoin Core](https://bitcoin.org/en/download) the original client but Bitcoin Core client can take up to 3 days to download the blockchain.  Electrum and multibit are lightweight clients and don't require that.\n\nAlso for more security look into [cold storage](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQ7a-WZzJas) and [paper wallets](https://www.bitaddress.org).  Also find out about hardware wallets like [Trezor](https://www.buytrezor.com/) which keep your keys safe on an external device, but still allow you to spend from them.  \n\nThere are mobile wallets too. [This](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.schildbach.wallet) wallet is pretty good for Android, and [bread wallet](http://app.breadwallet.com/) is good for i-phone.  [Airbitz](https://airbitz.co/#/) also seems like a cool new wallet.  It also  has a business directory.  [Mycelium](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mycelium.wallet) also seems widely recommended, and I hear it has a local trader option as well to find people to buy and sell bitcoins in your area..  Hopefully some of these links will help you out.\n\nYou can also spend bitcoins at many places including Overstock.com, Dell.com, NewEgg, TigerDirect, Dish Network, Expedia, etc...  Also some brick and mortar establishments, and restaurants are accepting it.  You can also use the [gyft](http://www.gyft.com/) ap to buy gift cards with bitcoin and use them anywhere like Home Depot, Sears, Amazon, Burger King, etc..\n\nYou can also play [poker](https://sealswithclubs.eu/) or other [casino games](http://www.dragons.tl/) for bits.

So it kind of implies that while velocity is slowly increasing, so is long term holding of coins too, but really old coins seems to be thinning out and super old coins is only increasing gradually.

What I am saying is that this debate has revealed a rift between what appear to be these two sides. There are certainly other reasons why people oppose sidechain implementation and I didn't imply otherwise.\n\nAnd since you mentioned it, do you personally think Bitcoin shouldn't have sidechain interoperability because you think it will cause mining centralisation or that it would increase the risk of a 51% attack on Bitcoin proper?": 1, "Really?

": 0, "I think we as a community need to definitely explore the side/tree chain option because right now Bitcoin is already using a very dirty one way pegged sidechain model where people use things like proof of burn (which I think is incredibly wasteful) or more sketchy funding methods like sending money to developers for a proportional number of these new atl/sidechain coins. These dirty side chains, as I like to call them, don't protect the bitcoin holders, and makes the bitcoins they contribute irretrievable down the line if the alt fails. \n\nSide/tree chains could better protect users and deter scams (as well as potentially making the alts more secure by taking advantage of the massive mining power Bitcoin offers), while also spurring innovation that could benefit everyone. Dirty sidechains are already happening and people will keep using proof of burn and very questionable funding methods regardless, I'd much rather we make it safer and easier for users. \n\nSide/tree chains is not a certainty though, people shouldn't rush in assuming that side/tree chains are an inevitability, but we have to acknowledge that there is a strong need for side/tree chains and that if it can be developed and integrated into Bitcoin where it doesn't pervert existing mining incentives or undermine the security of Bitcoin, and alts that would exist on top of it, then it should definitely be pursued. Even if certain problems can't be overcome, this shouldn't mean it should be abandoned, as solutions to these problems could be developed in the future.\n\nThe reality is dirty side chains are already here, so trying to avoid/deter use of sidechains is simply folly. If they can be integrated into Bitcoin safely then it should be pursued IMO.": 5, "Every single time something new is proposed for bitcoin, there are people that are vehemently against it.
