(This is looking like bitcoin too) So long, for instance, as debts in terms of anything but the official dollar cannot be enforced in legal process, it is clearly impracticable. (This is also bitcoin) Of course it would have been ridiculous to try to issue any other money if people could not make contracts in terms of it. But this particular obstacle has fortunately been removed now in most countries, so the way ought to be free for the issuing of private money.\n\nSo a lot of this theory can easily be seen in the tech.

We have until then to fix society enough that crypto is unnecessary. :)': 1, 'Cryptography and Bitcoin would be useless if it were possible to get the private key from a public key. The fact there are $40 million USD (equivalent) dependent on a single key not being reversed should give plenty of confidence that in reality this cannot be done.\n\n[Top 100 Balances on addresses](http://ondn.net:800/).': 1, 'tl;dr As of now, it isn\'t possible, but it may (or may not) be possible in the future.\n\nLong answer ahead. (Disclaimer: I\'m not an "expert" in cryptography, but I\'ve read a huge amount on it and related math over the years. If someone who knows what they\'re talking about says I\'m wrong, I\'ll accept it. I do think this is largely accurate. If you want to understand more, make a list of keywords I mentioned, and read the Wikipedia articles on all of them.)\n\nHere goes:\n\nIn theory, public key cryptography should mean that you can\'t get the private key from public, only the other way around. However, this requires somethig called a "one-way function". Intuitively, this is something that\'s easy to compute one way, but difficult to reverse.\n\nQuick background on those. There is an open problem in math/theoretical computer science called P=NP. (If you solve it, you win a million dollars! Unfortunately it\'s very hard.) The question is basically whether the group of all problems that can be solved "quickly" (known as P, which means that the time required for problems as they grow larger increases at worst polynomially with the length of the input), is equal to the group of problems that can be "checked quickly" (NP). IF P does equal NP, then one-way functions cannot exist, although the reverse is not true.\n\nTo sum up so far: if P=NP, almost all cryptography used today can be easily broken. (It\'s slightly more nuanced than that, P could equal NP but there could be no fast algorithms, etc,  but I\'m simplifying.)\n\nNow, the good news is that most mathematicians believe P does not equal NP. However, this does not mean your keys are safe. Even if P is not NP, the specific algorithm used may have a quick reversal, the keys may be small enough to brute force, or other possible problems.\n\nAnother digression. There\'s something called NP-complete. That means that for some problems, it can be shown that they are in P if and only if P=NP. So if P is *not* NP, they would be fine. However, not many encryption protocols use NP-complete problems.\n\nRSA uses factoring to achieve asymmetric encryption. Factoring is not known to be NP-complete. ECDSA, which bitcoin uses, is not known to be NP-complete either.\n\nSo the ECDSA functions used by bitcoin are not known to be secure, but they aren\'t known to be insecure either. Except \xe2\x80\xa6 quantum computers! Yes, there is a known algorithm that will break both RSA and ECDSA while running on a quantum computer. Check out Shor\'s algorithm.\n\nSo currently, the only thing blocking you from getting private keys from public ones is your lack of a quantum computer. Even without one, it\'s not been *proven* to be secure.\n\nWhat you can do: luckily, you don\'t really need to publish public keys until after they are used. You can send bitcoin to the hash, and only reveal the public key when you spend it. Another reason why address reuse is bad.': 6, 'Of course not.': 1, 'It\'s like mixing two colors of paint like red and blue to make purple. \n\nHow hard would it be to decrypt the purple back into two buckets of red and blue paint?\n\nIt\'s insanely hard. Many magnitudes harder than the effort to mix the two paints.\n\nBrute-force methods to decrypt your bitcoin public key would take more attempts than there are atoms in the universe.\n\nThat being said, you\'re more likely to lose your bitcoin due to:\n\n1) Human error - oops I left it on a computer and a hacker grabbed it\n2) Poor encryption - oops, I generated my key using a NSA-backdoored random number generator\n\nTo avoid getting Gox\'ed don\'t trust anyone who "holds your coins on your behalf". If you don\'t hold the private key to the coins yourself, then you\'re at a huge risk. Most exchanges and coin storages are risky. Don\'t store any coins with them. This includes coinbase, circle, bitstamp, btce, etc. - Pretty much ALL of them hold coins on "your behalf". Don\'t let them.\n\n\n\n': 2, 'And encryption is not replacement word for crypto.': 1, "Yeah my b.
