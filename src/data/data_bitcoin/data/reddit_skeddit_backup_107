(This can also be combined with the one above, e.g. only scan nonces where nonce % 1e6 is less than 100 and compute 100 hashes). Even the full million midstates takes about 128 megabytes, more than a tad smaller than the whole blockchain.\n\nThe goal here isn\'t a new one, it often goes under the name of "Throughput proof of storage" or "storage throughput proof of work". You can see a far more reasonable version of it described on my [alt ideas](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/User:Gmaxwell/alt_ideas) page from a few years ago, under "POW which involves queries against the UTXO set (set of spendable coins)".\n\nIgnoring the cryptographic flaw in the approach; this requires the user have the whole historical blockchain to verify it. Eliminating the potential for pruning. There is no reason any Bitcoin node needs to be non-pruned except to help bootstrap new nodes onto the network. It also prevents any kind of lite node-- they can\'t verify this proof, so an attacker could mine without providing it enormously faster than an honest miner and deceive all the lite nodes. Talk about cutting off your nose to spite your face.\n\nAmusingly, I suggested a much narrower idea in this space (not a throughput proof, but a knowledge proof) in early 2012, https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=68396.0 to stop that year\'s version of verification-less mining... The author of this idea is the first response.\n\nIt would be interesting to find out how things would fare for a Bitcoin without the people who spot flaws in these cryptographic proposals in seconds flat. Interesting, but I suspect not so good for the market price for my Bitcoins.\n\nThat said, perhaps it is time to discuss some of the actually _viable_ schemes which have been previously proposed for this.

Another option is to require proof of storage on transactions.  Users running nodes would be able to stamp their own transactions with proof of storage.  Users running SPV clients would need assistance from a node in order to generate a valid transaction, and presumably nodes would offer this service in exchange for fees.\n\nHere's an idea of how this could work.  A user assembles an unsigned transaction, where the value of the inputs exceeds the value of the outputs by the sum of the current mining fee plus a proof of storage fee.  The unsigned transaction is then sent to a node, which adds an output to the transaction that pays the proof of storage fee to its own address, and appends the current height of the blockchain.  The hash of the new transaction and the height are the inputs to the proof of storage function.  The result is appended to the transaction, which is returned to the user, and the user now signs this final version of the transaction.  This transaction is valid if included in a block no more than, say, 500 blocks away from the height included in the transaction.\n\nA suitable proof of storage function should depend on the data in the pruned blockchain, and should be something that can be quickly calculated by someone who has that data, after having prepared appropriate data structures.\n\nWhile requiring proof of storage to be included in the mining process would result in nodes being run in mining data centers, requiring proof of storage on transactions may result in a broader, global distribution of nodes.": 1, "It cant, you can't prove identity online?

Currently miners are paid ~1.5 million a day...not clear how much of that would end up in the hands of each full node operator, but even if it amounted to $20 a month that would tend to un-imbalance the economics of running a full node (if miners made blocks larger and larger, nodes would have to charge miners more $ for the KNBs).\n\nAnother idea for "internalizing" this externality would be to \'constantly be trying to defraud everyone\'...such that everyone would run a full node out of fear.

In a segwit-deployed world, the next critical infrastructure fix is to resolve the reasons that rational miners join the largest pools, such as minimizing their orphan rate.\n': 2, 'Bitcoin mining works by brute forcing SHA(SHA(previous block\'s headers + the nonce)).  In this scheme the nonce is a random number is adjusted and the hash calculated until a result less than that set by the difficulty is obtained.  This is proof of work.\n\nIn this way the nonce is guaranteed to be somewhat random and large.\n\nIn this proposal new blocks must contain, in addition to the proof of work, a "proof of data".  This is the SHA3-512 hash of the nonce-th byte of every block in the blockchain. In order to calculate this, a miner must find an acceptable proof of work (and thus, nonce), take that nonce and calculate a hash.  This hash requires data from every previous block in a way which is not predictable until the nonce is known.\n\nIn this way miners will have to have a complete copy of the blockchain to mine and/or gives nodes something valuable they can sell to miners (precomputed hashes for various nonces).\n\nFrom the article: http://trilema.com/2016/the-necessary-prerequisite-for-any-change-to-the-bitcoin-protocol/#selection-75.35-81.79\n> This measure heals that rift, by making it impossible for miners to mine without nodesv) ; and by giving nodes a directly valuable piece of information they can sell.\n\n*Edit* See dooglus below for some important clarifications.': 15, 'Can someone explain in more simple terms what the change is and how hard it is to implement?': 3, 'There are photos of the two of them in a room together with a lot of other people in bitcoin, and she is regularly available to speak on freenode.

That's how many of these 1-byte-per-block sha3-512 hashes miners will have to know if they want to mine using the full 32 bit nonce.\n\nAs I understand it, there's very little room in the header other than the nonce for changing bits. You can tinker with the time field a little, but not too much. So once you have tested the 4 billion different nonces you need to change something in the transaction list to change the merkle tree hash. Typically miners will change some bytes in the coinbase transaction called the extranonce.

Our openssl dependency is also a non-stop source of vulnerabilities that we have to continually keep updating, and the updates are very difficult to review owing to the code\'s legacy and broad purposes (which have little to do with ours).\n\nSure, we\'re not going to go out and invent our own hash functions (unlike some many altcoins POW...); as there is no need and the work required to do that and do it well is incredible. But implementing a boring, highly verified, RNG... it\'s not easy, but it might be the best option we have.\n\nIf, after watching my talk, you\'re still going to pound the tired old abstinence only message then you really have no business using Bitcoin at all, the whole thing is novel cryptography.  And Bitcoin Core (and accordingly, all these forks and altcoins that copy their code from us) contains many state of the art cryptographic constructs that we\'ve built.\n': 12, "Let's just say I would like to depend on professionals, with jobs in the field, that know what's needed and have decades of experience.": 8, 'Gavin on being Humble: "before the Foundation I was becoming the center of Bitcoin."': 3, 'lol.

It\'s (to me) a lot bigger than what some patent holder might do in some future day against a bitcoin startup, although certainly the chilling of innovation will be one bad effect of allowing people to patent things that are not new.    The other aspect of it is that the nature of what is being done (if you look at the filings) is a shot across the bow at free and open source culture.  \n\nAn ancillary effect to the applications (particularly those of Coinbase and the Bank of America, and arguably some others that can presently be seen on USPTO) is that they appear to be launching a shot over the bow at FOSS (free and open source software) developers who release software into the public domain on open platforms such as github and bitbucket where projects such as bitcoin (and over seven hundred other similar projects in the virtual currency space alone) are licensed under MIT or GPLv3.  In the case of GPLv3, if you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of GPLv3, through a publicly available network server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of GPLv3, to extend the patent license to downstream recipients. It may be, therefore, that free and open source cryptocurrency projects will be better protected from patent trolls by having a GPLv3 license rather than the MIT license that has been used with bitcoin.  However, the bulk of these patents we are seeing being filed simply are copies of pre-existing technology.  They utterly disregard even the patent process itself, indicating that they are likely to be submitting ongoing amounts of lots more patents until they get what they want - perhaps their first attempts will fail,but eventually they will secure some patents which allow them to control significant aspects of cryptocurrency movement on the bank side, and to suppress any active development by what today is free and largely unrestricted tech innovation in the decentralized, distributed open source software space.\n\n\n\nKeep in mind the TPP is very likely about to be signed, and that [it contains a provision banning the transfer of or access to source code of software](http://keionline.org/node/2363).  This is clearly part of an attack in stages on the free software movement, which in fact not only bitcoin but many thousands of software projects have relied upon in order to transfer code from one place to another and to share access to software.\n\nThese patent applications can be opposed, but I suspect that even when people are successful at opposing such patents, organizations such as Coinbase and BofA may refine and refile them, seeking to centralize control over virtual currency systems, and will likely become a serial applicant for bitcoin patents of a general nature. It will likely become necessary for the bitcoin community to rally not only to defend itself against Coinbase, but against numerous other patent trolls who will emerge in the near future.\n\nOne can just as easily envision the US government filing these patents as you could Coinbase or BofA (and eventually doing so on "national security" grounds). To me, this makes it even more urgent that we make precedent for defeating patent applications for general concepts that are written in a way intended to quell innovation in the development of decentralized systems.': 8}, ('How igot.com scammed me.', 7): {'I will setup a website specially to gather all details about the scam victims of igot.\n\nBy the end of this week I will put the website up.': 1, 'They scammed me also.
