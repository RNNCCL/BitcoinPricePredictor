So when you paid that key, the output script is, as above, pubkey+OP_CHECKSIG, and then to spend it, you just add the signature to the spending transaction.\n\nThe new method takes the top stack item and duplicates it (OP_DUP), takes that duplicated item and hashes it, so it's now a hash.  Then OP_EQUALVERIFY verifies that the top two stack items are equal.  So that duplicated/hashed item is compared to the hash given in the output script, and if they match, it drops them off the stack and continues.  Which leaves OP_CHECKSIG, which expects a public key and a signature to be the top stack items.

This is a "pay-to-public-key" (P2PK) script. Almost nobody uses such scripts anymore, but they are still accepted by the network.\n\nThe second kind of transaction will unlock a coin for anyone who can provide a signature matching the pre-specified *hash value* of a public key. In other words, the script doesn\'t specify a public key, but rather the hash value of a public key. This is a "pay-to-public-key-hash" (P2PKH) script. One way to represent the hash is with a traditional address (a string of characters beginning with "1").\n\nThe hash value is a bit more complicated than it might seem. It\'s computed by first taking the SHA-256 hash value of the public key, and then taking the RIPEMD-160 hash value of the resulting hash value. It\'s a double-hash value.\n\nReversing the process to arrive at the original public key is not something that has been theoretically demonstrated with quantum computers. So although a quantum computer *might* be able to derive a private key from a public key, deriving a public key from an address would, as far as anybody has made public, be an insurmountable challenge.\n\nWhen you lock coins using the standard P2PKH script, your *public* key remains secret.
