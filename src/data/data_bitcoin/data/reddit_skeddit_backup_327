In the case with SideChains the cartel could supplement revenue by being paid to Merge Mining side-chains that other miners dont have assess too. \n\ngiving the power to the miners to set block size by vote to the majority will ultimately tend towards centralization, where in BIP101 this power is vested in the market and incentives that govern it.

Does the encoded message really just mean "8mb good" without endorsing a specific BIP or whatever? Whats the fucking point in that case? \n\nIt\'s BIP101 which has the specification.\n\nNumerous BIPs have been run in the same manner: miners sign the coinbase field of their mined block with their preference; for BIP12, miners chose between BIP16, 17 and 18; BIP16 won, which is why we use `P2SH` for multisig instead of `OP_EVAL`. \n\nYou\'d certainly remember BIP66 (a BIP62 offshoot), which enforced DER signatures (and caused the fork last month): BIP66 outlines exactly what the voting criteria is.\n\nSo for BIP101, it\'s going to go with miners\' votes (in their coinbase field of the block); the specifics are/will be in BIP101. It\'s possible, like BIP12, that 2 or 3 contenders will appear. \n\n**Miners are the voters though**\n\nIt has all changed from when I first got into Bitcoin; back then this sort of community disagreement could be settled much easier because the community could actually have their vote heard (as everyone ran nodes).\n\nIs this good? **NO**.

We just default to 12 in our client.  12 words is actually quite secure.  Trezor originally defaulted to 12 words, but changed to 24 because their recovery method wasn\'t quite secure with 12.  We believe that more words means more opportunities to write down the incorrect mnemonic, and so this is why we default to 12. (and by the way, sometimes 12 words runs onto a second page on KeepKey)\n\n> Trezor displays the 2 entropy sources used to generate the mnemonic both confirming device and computer entropy and allowing a user to independently verify the process, does keep key do the same?\n\nOurs is exactly the same, but just like Trezor, entropy is only shown when requested by the client.\n\n> Firmware update mode needs to be impossible to accidentally boot into, Trezor has 2 buttons required to enable this mode, how does one firmware update keep key?\n\nYou hold down the one button while pluging in your device.  It is difficult to do by mistake. Our extension detects firmware update mode and walks you through update.\n\n> A dedicated Cancel button is user friendly\n\nFirst, the Trezor protocol supports a "Cancel" message.  So, for example, clicking out of our extension automatically cancels what KeepKey was doing.  Also, every confirmation prompt in our extension has a cancel option.

We also have some really cool multisig things we are playing with, but for that you will have to stay tuned.\n\n>How does your browser wallet/chrome app work\n\nSo, essentially you must first install our Chrome extension.  When you go to use it the first time, it will prompt you to install a Chrome App.  The App does the actual device communication, and then relays it to the extension.  We don\'t have any servers for blockchain data.  We currently are using chain.com but are migrating to blockcypher.  In the end, we will probably have multiple backend providers in case one is down.  I can promise you this: we will not be running a self hosted BoP server ;)  Also, we don\'t maintain any servers for the extension/app to work, so we will not see any transactions.  The client only communicates with chain.com or blockcypher. Both App and Extension are open source, so you can verify this.  You can also watch outgoing connections to make sure we didn\'t sneak anything in.  I would add though, we take Privacy very seriously.  If there is ever a feature that requires us hosting it on a server, we will rethink the feature.\n\n>Do you plan to make Pull Requests for your code patches to the Trezor firmware ?\n\nOnly bugs, and changes in the common code they would benefit from.

Thus on average miner spends 1 second out of 600 mining on top of an old block while new one is being downloaded, and if he happens to generate a block during this time, it's likely to be orphaned. Hence his orphan rate is on scale of 1/600, that is, 0.17%. (His blocks might be also orphaned because he uploads them relatively slowly, that number should be also on this scale but hard to predict as it depends on topology.)\n\n0.17% isn't much, also on the 1 second time scales propagation latency effects kick in, so decreasing block size below 1 MB won't proportionally decrease the orphan rate.\n\nNow if we increase allowed block size this 'slow connection' miner will have higher orphan rate, so he has an incentive either to start cheating (SPV mining) or join a bigger mining pool instead of mining himself.\n\nWhy do we care about miners with slow connections? Well in some parts of the world faster connections are prohibitively expensive, so if we cater only to those with faster connections mining might concentrate in few areas with cheap electricity and fast connections.\n\nBut miners are already SPV-mining?
