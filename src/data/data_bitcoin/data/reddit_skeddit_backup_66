Just because \'competition is good\' applies in some areas that doesn\'t mean you can run apply it as a golden rule to everything.

I would argue that a universal language would be beneficial to society as a whole, as it would break down barriers that further racial and ethnic divides among us, and might well enhance our feelings of comraderie with those of different nationalities than our own.

This is know as max block size. The Bitcoin network generates a new block of transaction data roughly every 10 minutes. All transactions worldwide during those last 10 minutes should be included in the block. But currently, blocks cannot be bigger than 1 MB, and if there are more transactions than fit within 1 MB, we have a problem.\n\nThere are two competing proposals to solve the problem:    \n1) Allow bigger blocks.  \n2) Reduce number of transactions.\n\nThe "lightning network response so scalability" is 2). It means to develop new software, called "Lightning Network", which moves many transactions off the blockchain into so-called sidechains. The Lightning Networks would be operated and controlled by companies or other entities who can implement their own policies and fees and they would only occasionally settle their balances on the real blockchain. \n\n1) would be a very simple change in the code. The downside is that it puts higher bandwidth requirements on the miners who produce the blocks. This puts miners with connectivity problems (e.g. those in China) at a disadvantage and it drives up cost for mining, which may lead to fewer people mining.\n\n2) requires entirely new software including solving hard theoretical problems. It works with the assumption that keeping the block size limited will lead to higher Bitcoin transaction fees as people try to get their transaction included. This in turn would drive more transactions off the blockchain and onto the Lightning Network. The companies running a Lightning Network will then somehow derive enough benefit from it so that they have no problem paying high transaction fees to settle on the blockchain.': 1, "There's one character missing in the comic: a guy who puts money to the Big Blocker's pocket.

Lightning Network helps because it moves [smaller, higher volume] transactions off the main chain to this alternate payment system.  That\'s phenomenal.  Plus it [creates] new types of transactions that aren\'t even possible today.  The current Bitcoin network capacity is so small that a relatively few number of people worldwide can have access to it.  \n\nThe main thing that makes the Lightning Network so awesome is that it *requires* the Bitcoin network.  You can open a Coinbase account and NEVER do a Bitcoin transaction.  Ever.  You can open a Coinbase account right now.  You can buy and sell things all over the internet.  And you\'ll never have done a single on-chain transaction. The Lightning Network lets you do all these little "side-transactions", but it is 100% always based on a *confirmed transaction on the Bitcoin Network*.  And when you close the channel, its [back] on the Bitcoin network.  It is bound to the Bitcoin network.  That\'s the beauty of it.  \n\nThat means that we are limited in users.  So if the Lightning Network can do billions of transactions (when in fact it can) it can only do those billions of transactions for about 2 Million people.  Because the current 1MB blocksize limit at 3 transactions per second, 2 million people can do about 2 transaction a month.  Lightning Network transactions require on-chain transactions.  But on-chain transactions are gated, and we can only support so many.  \n\nIts remarkable to me that there\'s all this media hype, and in reality so few people actually use Bitcoin.  On the giant echo-chamber of Reddit, there\'s probably a thousand to two-thousand who check that damn thing every day of the week, and have arguments.   On the slack channels, there\'s maybe a dozen of the same cast of characters.  We actually are a very small community in proportion to the media coverage.   \n\nMost of us are super enthused and excited about Bitcoin because we want to see it go out to the world.  We want the whole world to know how awesome it is.  We want everyone in Venezuela... to not have their money debased by their government.  To escape capital controls and an oppressive government.  Obviously that [kind of effect] hasn\'t happened [yet] because we only have a handful of a few million people using Bitcoin.  \n\nBut if all of a sudden 50 million people wanted to use Bitcoin?  You can\'t.  And not with the Lightning Network either.  So ... my big thing... my vision for the future of Bitcoin is:  Lets move all these petty, low value transactions off to Layer 2.  Lets not clutter the bitcoin network with this stuff.  But we also need to support more people.  We need more people to come in.  Do we have that demand today?  2 Billion people who need to open payment channels today?  Probably not.  \n\nBut i sure want to have a growth plan that says: "We are not going to force people off to walled-gardens.  We are not going to force them to the Circles and Coinbases of the world. I want them to be able to hold their value on the Bitcoin Network. If they want to move their life savings [an example of a large transaction that wouldn\'t necessarily utilize the Lightning Network], I want them to be able to do an on-chain transaction.  I want more than a million or two people to be able to do that."  \n\nAnd the block size is going to have to grow if we ever want to see Bitcoin used by more people.  If it doesn\'t grow, then its only going to be used by a relatively small number of people who will be very wealthy.  There will be banks and financial institutions, and everybody else will move to an alt coin or some centralized service".\n\nTagging /u/austindhill et al.': 3, 'Nice.
