C isn't smart enough to check that pointer accesses with subscripts (offsets) stay in bounds.  You have to do that manually.

Thank you once again.": 2, "That's a tall order there.\n\nProgramming in C/C++ for security (crypto, correct memory handling, etc) involves avoiding a *lot* of pitfalls.  Experienced programmers who have been working in C for decades routinely make them.  Even if you were working on BitcoinJ (which might be a good idea -- they can probably use help keeping up now), there's still a lot to know.\n\nThere's no substitute for experience.  Working with smart programmers, you learn things from them in response to what you've done in code and what you're trying to do... but reading a ton of books won't hurt.  \n\nHere's something that attempts to teach secure programming in C and C++:  http://www.amazon.com/Secure-Programming-Cookbook-Cryptography-Authentication/dp/0596003943/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1452714907&sr=8-1&keywords=secure+c+programming+cookbook  [disclosure:  I'm a tech editor on it]\n\nThat also has introductions to using crypto (secure hashes, signing, public keys, key exchange, etc) from C.\n\nRead anything by DJ Bernstein:  https://cr.yp.to/.  He's one of the few people consistently writing secure C code, and he has written some great pieces about it.\n\nFind some good intrusion books that show you how to write buffer overflows.  Even if you don't get really good at it, understanding the theory will eliminate a blindspot.  A lot of corporate code is terrible (Cisco, Adobe, etc) because progarmmers are super focused on production -- cranking out code -- and never step back and gain this wider perspective.  Their products are all sitting ducks and they're completely oblivious to it because they have no concept of how this works.  They expect every string copy to work flawlessly with no implications or gotchas because they don't know about these gotchas.  Similarly, DEFCON talks are online now days.  The original stack smashing (related to buffer overflows) was published by 2600 magazine, ages ago, and titled _Smashing the Stack for Fun and Profit_, I believe.  It's still relevant and still a good introduction.\n\n_Hardening Linux_ from APress is another fantastic book that'll give you loads of insight into practical security considerations on a Linux machine.\n\nUnix (and Linux) were revolutionary, but it's easy to take the ideas and innovations for granted and forget about them.  New programmers tend to assume that just because they're writing code for Unix on a Unix system, their code will magically suck less than IBM mainframe code, Windows code, etc.  This fallacy leads to a lot of crappy code.  From the smallest one-liner to the largest system, your code will benefit immensely from actually understanding the Unix philosophy.  So read _The Design of the UNIX Operating System_.\n\nTo become a skilled programmer capable of solving problems, you absolutely must study algorithms.  There's a Damn Cool Algorithms tumblr or something somewhere.  There are also large books.  IMO, 70% of the battle is understanding the concepts (data representation comes first, trade offs, etc) so you don't need to study every popular searching and sorting algorithm -- just read about a bunch of cool algorithms and consult the table of contents of _Introduction to Algorithms_ by Cormen et al.  If the for loop over a set of data is your primary means of solving problems, you're doing it wrong.  Trying to process twice as much data will take to-the-power-of-2 times as much time.  There are better ways.  Often solving new problems involves finding them.  Bitcoin is very much about efficient representation of data and operation on data.\n\n_Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs_ will teach you to solve hard problems.\n\nEdit:  Obviously, you can't do this all at once.

If you own a home worth $200,000 for example, I will give you a signed contract today that says I'd buy it from you for $5 million cash. Great deal? No. My terms for this example are that the $5 million be paid to you from me $1 a day for 5 million days. See? What seemed like a great deal based on price is actually a terrible deal depending on the terms.\n\nLottery winnings and most legal settlements are based on an annuity from a guaranteed stream of money. The big fat number never exists. Just a smaller sum that they know will add up to this over time. The only way the lottery or insurance companies can guarantee this stream of money is to place the funds into something like CDs or T-Bills. So, as long as you can beat T-Bills (among the worst returning investments) then the cash option makes sense. With a cash option you can also have a lot more flexibility with tax payments -you'd pay a huge early sum of taxes but later on much of the growth could be tax deferred and only paid when gains are realized - these could also be offset by losses- so. over time your tax liability would be much less.\n\nWith the $600 million or so cash value of this lottery winning (after taxes) you could have access to the types of private equity, hedge fund and venture funds used by the very wealthy - in many cases these investments see consistent returns in the high teens range and have for years. I still wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t bank on getting an 18% return though -- too many variables and issues. We could face a global downturn and there are many other issues. \n\nYou also would not want to bank everything on a few money managers or funds no matter how good they were because the high returning funds are more susceptible to big down years. \n\nThere is something called a Monte Carlo analysis which shows that even a return of 18% average might not perform as well as an average of 12% over the same five year (or whatever) time period. How? Because if the first one returns, for example, -30%, -15%, +10%, +35% and then +90% it is an average of 18% while another with an average from 12%, 12%, 12%, 12%, 12% equals 12% of course but would have more money than the first one. This is because those early down years knocked the first option down so it had to play harder to catch up. If each of the above started with $100,000 the first one would be earning interest on only $59,500 by the end of year two, while the second one is earning its 12% on $125,440. At the end of five years, option two has $176,234 versus option one having $167,879 - despite an average annual return that is 50% better!\n\nSo, I'd say to plan on a return of something like 8-9% and tell the money managers to target that (not each fund but someone like me or a family office who is doing the overall asset allocation). It would be nice to be pleasantly surprised. Personally I'd put the majority of the $600 million - probably $300 Million+ into a portfolio of venture capital and private equity funds and a simple global equity portfolio made up of large multinationals. I'd have another $70 million for hedge funds and opportunistic investments. I'd have a good of $100 mil or so chunk in global real estate - income properties and agriculture diversified by type and country - I'd buy most of it myself rather than through a REIT or fund. I'd have small amount - maybe 5-10% in bills, notes in global currencies. \n\nI'd put 5% in Bitcoin and 5% in Bitcoin related investments - but I would not recommend that for a client who was not familiar with that industry. Perhaps I'd recommend 1% or so for someone else - it really depends on their risk tolerance and other factors. I'd also have a small amount in commodities - maybe 5% or a bit more. I'd have physical gold and silver in a vault as well as some exposure through agriculture etc. This portfolio would only work for someone who can whether the ups and downs of global capital markets. If you are the type to panic and sell everything if you lose $50 or even more on paper, then you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want this portfolio.\nSome math:\n\n(Tax advantage of cash option not included)\n\nAnnuity payment option on $1.4 billion = $70,000,000 / year FOR 20 YEARS\nCash option = lump sum of $868 million = if you invested this and were able to get 8.1% annually -- you would receive $70,308,000 FOREVER \xe2\x80\x93 the ideal thing of course would be to live on less and let it grow more.\n\nYou'd also have significant tax savings from the cash option over time (but you would have a large initial tax bill).\n\nThis is a rare opportunity that the lottery could make someone not just silly rich or temporary rich or rich enough to go broke as the lotto often does but it could make someone actually rich.": 2, 'i always feel that if I buy BTC and hold it. i am actually doing something good for humanity and people who were born in poor corrupted country.': 1, "None.
