You can even require a pin that the traveler must enter to authorize the transaction. All of this could be done with a mounted tablet, and maybe even a separate mounted camera for quickly scanning a QR-code on the card to use as a "account number". The traveler receives a receipt by email (or printed in store) showing a change in account balance, merchant receives a credit to his account at the county.\n\nThe merchant/traveler can then go to the county to withdraw his funds (either in BTC or have it converted back to another currency at an exchange % again).\n\nI think essentially, THAT\'S how Bitcoin will become modern. Once we have a Visa/Mastercard-type card that can be swiped like a credit card. And there will have to be a payment provider that accounts for the user\'s balance in a local-ledger, as opposed to sending every transaction through the blockchain. \n\nYes, that ruins the point of holding your own money, but nothing is stopping you from withdrawing your funds from this "bank". You only need to keep an amount in this "bank" which you use for every-day transactions, and withdraw the rest into your secure wallet.\n\nBut it\'s less of a bank, and more of a "payment provider", like PayPal.\n\nYou could also then mint your own currency, ie. say you spend lots of money to print counterfeit-proof bills (ie. you go to the company in Germany that prints all the world\'s currencies at their high-tech facility), and each bill represents 5-units, 10-units, 20-units.

That wave of merchants is continuing, but slowing down because PR is not sustainable and the "first-mover" advantage no longer exists in a lot of segments (travel, non-profits, media, consumer electronics, etc). A year ago, it made a big splash to be the first large comapny to accept bitcoin in any segment- you\'d be the first in your segment and gain thousands of loyal new customers. I think we\'ll continue to see that happen in new segments, but there\'s simply fewer of those segments today than there was a year ago (hence the slowdown).\n\nThe most exciting long-term benefits of bitcoin are the cost savings. Bitcoin is going to be compelling to large merchants for cost savings only when the userbase is large enough to really impact their bottom lines. New user adoption is key for this.

No one, not even the systems administrators and equipment manufacturers, should be able to modify or exclude votes cast by others;\n\n2. No one, not even the systems administrators and equipment manufacturers, should be able to determine how anyone else voted.\n\n3.

Any claim of fraud or system malfunction can be verified in a convincing way.\n\nCriterion 4, in particular, excludes any system that allows vote from home or from mobile devices, and any system that requires or allows the voter to use electronic devices of his own while voting.  The vote must happen in a carefully arranged and monitored cabin. Voters must leave any personal devices such as cellphones and cameras outside that cabin, that should contain only certified voting equipment and materials. Voters cannot take any record of their vote out of that cabin, except to place it in a ballot box under the eyes of inspectors.\n\nThere are already systems that satisfy all those requirements: plain paper voting, and electronic voting machines with a voter-verified paper trail (VVPT).  They are very cheap and simple to set up and operate, even in desolate places, by any moderately intelligent person.  Their main problem is that their safety depends on correct use: voting officers and party inspectors must know the essential precautions, must keep their eyes open and brains engaged all the time, and the paper ballots must be counted on the spot, right after the election ends. \n\nI have a few stories of "modern technology" voting systems that were deployed by amateurs, without regard for the above principles, and turned into humongous fiascos.  But the recent runoff election for the board of the Bitcoin Foundation is a good example too. \n\nPS.
