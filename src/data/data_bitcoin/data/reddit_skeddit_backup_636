So if the SNB had printed CHF and simply kept them, then if you ignore the second- and third-order effects of the policies, the value of their holdings would be higher than they are now.\n\nIt's evaluating the effect of the second- and third-order effects that is really tricky, and why it's hard to say this was a bad move, even if the SNB 'lost' money with the policy change.\n\nIMO the policy change was coming, whether they liked it or not (with ECB imminently about to start QE).

So Swiss companies lose.\n\nMercantilist detected.\n\nIf these Swiss companies hold CHF, they also became wealthier. They can now buy cheaper/better raw materials, cheaper/better means of production, cheaper/better labor abroad etc. They are wealthier, what allows them to use this extra wealth to either become more competitive or pivot their business to something where their competitive advantage is more significant.\n\nI'll repeat myself: The idea of decreasing the wealth of all holders of a particular currency in order to temporarily subsidize a much smaller group of society (exporters) is not only evil in nature but wrong from a simple utilitarian perspective.": 4, "No. Using the word *revaluation* would be incorrect for two reasons, but I'm starting to repeat myself -- and also feel a bit ashamed to be the reason of you losing more than 10 minutes today.\n\nLet me make this very simple.\n\n1) thanks to you, I learned that devaluation (resp. revaluation) has a political connotation.

I've come to the conclusion that at this point in time, it isn't an advantage to the consumer to use cryptocurrency, but it is an advantage to the merchant to accept it.\n\n1.  Cryptocurrency has near instantaneous transactions.  Credit cards and paypal and bank transfers take days.  You don't notice this as a consumer, because it says you paid immediately after you paid, but the merchant doesn't get the money until a few days(!) later.\n\n2.  Cryptocurrency has negligible transaction fees.  Credit cards, paypal and bank transactions take a few percent of the transaction.  You don't notice this as a consumer, because those fees are built into the price of the item you are buying, so you are paying them, but you don't know it.\n\n3.  By accepting cryptocurrency as a merchant, you cannot be scammed by the consumer, as it is a one-way final transaction.  They can't counterfeit money (with the obvious exception of a 51% attack) and they can't claim fraudulent chargeback on their credit card or paypal account, and they can't write checks that bounce.  This will lead to lower fees for the merchants.  As a consumer, you don't notice the increase in prices due to stolen items and fraudulent chargebacks, because these are built into the price that you pay up front.\n\nSo you see where I am going.  Using cryptocurrencies has numerous financial advantages to merchants who accept them.  In time, widespread use of cryptocurrency will lead to lower prices for customers who pay with them.  Right now though, most companies simply translate the fiat/USD price of the item into what it equals in whatever crypto.  This gives the merchants higher profit margins, because of the inherent advantages with crypto.  Eventually, they will realize that they can offer the same product at a lower price in crypto than their competitors who only accept fiat.  *This is when the consumer wins by using crypto.*  But we aren't there yet.  In the meantime, we need to keep using cryptos at merchants so that they see the cost savings and all those advantages I mentioned.

Plus it works the same way everywhere online and offline, that's a unique feature.\n\nIt's store of value is still being decided on. Yet you can choose to use bitcoin as a transaction network and a currency without using it as a store of value by using locking services like coinapult or bitreserve. They completely eliminate volatility if you want that.\n\nBitcoin is an experiment with huge payoffs if successful. Developments in Bitcoin would have benefits for finance across the world, not just in select geographical areas. It enables people to use the internet and collaborate in a way that wasn't fully possible before. Plus the speed at which this grows already outpaces the traditional system by a landslide in terms of security, transparency, and accessibility.\n\nThis is why it's valuable to have people take that leap into bitcoin and test things out. Tinker, see what works and what needs to be built. The more people taking this leap, the more success bitcoin companies will see and can expand.\n\nDoes this clarify what I said a bit or does it still sound washy?

When the payment-on-destination is automatically carried out via a program embedded in the money itself, it would be impossible for anybody to charge for a feature that can be executed for free.\n\nThis same idea could apply to virtually anything. Executions of a living will upon death. Payment upon completion of product delivery scan from FedEx or UPS. Even payment of salary carried out on payday without the need for a company clerk or accounting department.\n\nMost importantly, do keep in mind that this idea of "payment upon some completed action or timestamp" is just one of an infinite possible ways which money can be programmed to be more useful and cut out fees from the now useless middlemen of the world.

It self adjusts such that the network will always take 'on average' 10 minutes to find a solution.  People turning on/off hashing hardware just reduces/increases the chances your machine will be the one who finds the solution to the next block to add to the blockchain.\nI.e. really don't worry about it as it's a positive re-enforcing system and the hash rate only effects miners, not users.\n\n\nThe other point is you're comparing bitcoin and fiat, the two are incredibly different.  Not sure where to start with this but think about trying to spend a 5cm cube of ruthenium in your local shop... it's bloody difficult to get anyone to accept it because they have no idea what it's utility is or what the market value is they'll be able to trade it at even though it is so expensive they'd be lucky to ever see a cube of it in their lifetime.\n\nBitcoin is simliar in that it's a finite resource and people who understand what it can do are keen to get hold of as much of it as they can because in time others will start to understand why it's so valuable.\n\nRight now bitcoin sucks at a store of value for most developed countries.  Firstly it has 10% inflation, secondly it's so new that there are a few whales out there able to throw their weight around to move the price any which way they'd like.\nBoth of these will change over time.  Inflation halves for each block halving every 4 years.  So in 2017 Bitcoin inflation is only 5% and in 2021 2.5%, 2025 it will be less than nearly all fiat currencies.  This is 100% predictable, certain, facts... no fiat can offer this.  At inflation < local fiat inflation it now becomes more appealing to have your value stored as bitcoin rather than any local fiat as you merely exchange out to your local currencies as you need to spend locally.\n\n\nBitcoin is still an experiment, it's still incredibly young, it's still vastly untapped for what it's designed for and it's a technology that can't be uninvented so here to stay.\nThis is why the number of people using it will continue to grow quietly and the supply/demand ratio can only become established given much longer time scales than 6 years.\n\n": 1, 'I guess the hope is that once Bitcoins value is high enough it becomes too costly to manipulate big swings and cause volatility.

Bitcoin is owned by its users and its default currency is based on a mathematical algorithm which no one controls.
