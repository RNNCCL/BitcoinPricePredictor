The very best you can do is to create a mathematical abstraction that resembles trust and hope that abstraction holds true.\n\nThis paper does nothing except poke holes in one of those abstractions while claiming superiority of another one.\nIt is a well thought out hole poking, but it completely misses the point.\n\nBitcoin, Peercoin, all of these "coins" fail as a store of value.  At least in the long term.\nMath itself has no value.  The "trust" mechanism for all of them fail, under various circumstances and it really only matters how long until it fails.\n\nThe same argument can easily be extended to paper money "How do you know this paper was really printed by the mint?"\nIt can also be extended to precious metals, "How do you know that this gold ingot isn\'t brass/lead?".\n\nYou can\'t, not without some sort of elaborate mechanism, but eventually you just need to fall back to trust.\nWhy?  Because you are very confused.  You have assumed that a store of value is the same thing as a medium of exchange.\n\nYou are trying to exchange a store of value, this is wrong.  Why?\n\nBecause a medium of exchange implies a contract.  A contract always involves trust, somewhere.  \nAll you are doing is changing who you trust.\n\nNow what is a medium of exchange?\nA medium of exchange is any item that both parties agree to exchange to facilitate a trade.\n\nFor instance if I agree to trade you 2 of my sheep for 1 of your cows.  I must trust that your cow is yours to trade, and you must trust that my sheep are mine to trade.  Furthermore we most both agree that your cow is indeed a cow, and that my sheep are indeed sheep.\nWe may also need to agree that my sheep are healthy and alive, as is your cow (unless we are trading mutton for veal).\n\nThis can get complicated, because I might know a lot about sheep, but nothing about cows, and you might know cows but nothing about sheep.\nHow about I give my sheep to a vet and he gives me 2 sheep coins.  You take your cow to the same vet and he gives you 1 cow coin.\n\nThen we can meet somewhere and I will trade you 2 sheep coins for your 1 cow coin.\n\nYour cow coin is not really a cow is it?  It is merely something I can use to go to the vet and have him give me a cow for.\nMy sheep coins are not really sheeps.  They are just something you can go to the vet and trade for 2 sheeps.\n\nThis is good, but we both have to trust the same vet now.  Even if we trust the same vet, how do I know your cow coin is a REAL cow coin?\nGood for me, I\'ve seen cow coins before, they are really fancy and hard to fake.  So I can trust that your cow coin will get me a real cow when I go to the vet.\n\nYou know what a sheep coin is because you have seen a sheep coin before.  Mine look good enough, so you trust that I give you 2 real sheep coins.\n\nWhat are we really trusting?\nWe are actually trusting that when we go to the vet, that he will give you 2 sheep and me 1 cow in exchange for our coins.\n\nI take your cow coin to the vet and he says "Yes that is a real cow coin, but the cow it represented died."\nI trusted you, but you gave me a dead cow?  I didn\'t want a dead cow I wanted a live one!\n\nYou are bad man!\n\nThere is no mathematical abstraction for trust.  Trust is given.  I must know you to trust you.  A machine cannot really know another machine.\nYour abstractions are leaking.\n\nMy store of value was my sheep, but I needed 1 cow.  \nSince my sheep cannot make a cow, I had to trade them them.\nAt that point they were no longer a store of value for me.  Because I valued a cow more than my two sheep.\nI traded them to the vet for 2 sheep coins, because not everyone knows a good sheep.\n  \nYour store of value was your cow.  But you wanted 2 sheep.\nYou cannot chop your cow up and get sheep out.  \nYou know that if you did this that you would find that there were no sheep inside your cow.\nYou traded your cow to the vet for a cow coin.   \nYou did this because you needed 2 sheep.  \n\nWe traded coins, you got my 2 sheep, but your cow died.  \nBut your cowcoin still lives!\n\nHow is that possible?\n\nBecause your cowcoin contains within it one cow?\nNo, that can not be right!\n\nI get sword because if I cannot have 1 live cow, I will have 1 dead cowboy!\nBut vet steps up and says...\n"Wait!  Do not chop cowboy to little bits!  Cow died AFTER I gave cow coin to cowboy!  Cow is made of meat.  I will trade meat to next Cowboy who come, and I will get you new cow.  Maybe I get you new cow with baby!  Then you have 1 big cow and 1 little cow!"\n\n"So what you are saying Vet, is that if I trust you and come back in a few days, then you will give me at least 1 healthy cow and maybe even a new baby cow too?"\n\n"Yes you can have new cow, because 1 cow is just about the same as any other cow."\n\n"But how do I prove you will do this? What is you forget?"\n\n"You already have proof.  Cow coin, is proof of cow!"\n\nIn a week I come back, Vet has new cow and cow had baby.  I can get both.\nCow coin was medium of exchange to me.  Cow was store of value, but I needed to wait for a future cow.\n\nInstead of cow, I decide later that I want to get beer.\nCan I trade cow coin for beer coin?\n\nPossibly, but how about we get someone to make an everything coin?  Then we can trade anything for anything!\nIt needs to be someone we all trust.  The king is a really rich guy.  He has no reason to make a fake everything coin, because he already has everything.  Also if he does make a fake everything, we can all go get swords and chop king into bits.\nSo we give king the authority to make everything coin, because we have agreed to trust the king.  Now we just need to make sure we trust eachother to not give eachother false everything coins.\n \nThis is what I hear when I hear proof of work and proof of stake.\nYou are trying to trust someone you do not know.\n\nWith proof of work you trust math that your bitcowcoin is not fake and belongs to the person who gives it to you.\nIf that person is so powerful that they can suddenly own 51% percent of the hashing power, then really you are saying that 51 of the hundred vets in town agree that your BitCowcoin is a real BitCowcoin.  So I can trust that when the time comes to get my cow, at least 51 of those vets will be willing to give me a real live cow.  Who knows?  Maybe that cow will have baby cows?\n\nWith proof of stake you trust math that sheepcoin is not fake and belongs to the person who gives it to you.\nIf that person is so powerful that they can suddenly own so many of sheepcoins that many people are accepting their sheep coins, and at least one of those people have a real sheep.  Then it does not matter if his sheepcoins are fake sheepcoins and not real sheepcoins.  What matters is you can trade sheepcoins for real sheeps.\n\n\nConfuseus say...\nStore value only in things that are of value to you.\nIf you need to trade, use medium of exchange, but do not hold onto medium of exchange for long, because your cow might die.\n\n': 1, 'Nxt is too small for any government to care about.

We have Augur\'s sale upcoming in the next month as well. \n\nWhen you purchase Factoids, you are not donating. You are making a purchase of the Factoid tokens. Not sure where you\'re thinking you get "nothing". The Factoids will be used to be converted into entry credits that must be used to hash documents on the Factom network. \n\nIt is a software sale, we are selling Factoids which are in essence a one time license to use the protocol. We have also implemented many accountability features, such as vested milestones. This means that there are three detailed milestones laid out, and Factom will not receive any portion of the money until the milestone is hit. The BTC is stored in a multi-sig account until then. Factom is not just being handed all of this money, and if they don\'t deliver the detailed milestones or our technical evaluator dose not believe it\'s up to par, the money will not be released / will be given back to the participants.\n\nThe multi-signature account needs the technical evaluator (Vlad Zamfir, a well known and respected bitcoin security researcher / developer). Before we did the Gems (Which recieved a $400K seed investment post-sale from a very notable VC firm) and the Factom sale, 100% of the money raised in sales we\'re immediately given in full to the project/team. We facilitate actual accountability when it comes to releasing of funds now. \n\nWe have met Factom many times, our team has flown to Austin 3 times just this month to meet with them (on top of the many times in the past ~4 months as well). We vet our projects for a LONG time and make sure they meet many qualifications before taking them on for a sale. Factom has been in development for a very long time, they have working code written, and a live alpha API that you can use today. We stay in very close contact with the community, and listen to their responses. \n\nIf you have any legitimate questions regarding the sale or structure of how Koinify operates, I would be happy to answer or help out.

Many believe deflation occurs.

It had many useful improvements, including support for system passcode and Touch ID.\n\nWithin the first day a few customers complained that they can not perform payments. Re-installing the wallet and restoring it from backup helped resolve the issue. On the second day we received a few more complaints, some of them stating that a backup was never made, so they cannot simply re-install the wallet.\n\nTo limit potential losses, we immediately pulled the app from the App Store to prevent remaining users from automatically updating until we investigate and resolve the problem.\n\nImmediate analysis showed that only a few of our users has experienced this problem. Additional testing did not show if there is a bug in the application that could have lead to the lock out of funds. We also could not reproduce the issue where updating from v1.0 to v1.1 makes payments impossible on any of our own systems.\n\nWe began collecting reports from customers with various details of their iPhone setup, and reached out to several customers to perform additional diagnostics on their devices. While investigating the issue, we learned that several other iOS developers reported a similar intermittent issue with a security component known as "Keychain": the operating system simply locks the application out of the secret data being stored by it. We could not yet find a concrete explanation on how that\'s possible and what is the best workaround for it (e.g. https://devforums.apple.com/thread/246122?start=0&tstart=0).\n\nThe investigation is ongoing, but in the meanwhile we have implemented mitigation methods to reduce the impact of the issue. We are still testing it and very soon will resubmit the app to the App Store.\n\n### Next steps\n\n1. If you have a previous verson (1.0) installed, please make sure you have made a back up. It can be done in Settings tab -> Export Wallet Master Key. You will be shown a list of words: write them down and re-enter to make sure you did not make a mistake.\n\n2. If you have the latest version (1.1) installed and it works fine for you, still make sure you have a backup as described above.\n\n3. If you cannot send money and you have made a backup, please make sure your back up is still accessible. When the update comes out, you will be able to simply re-install the app, enter your backup words, and use it normally.\n\n4. If you have not made a backup, but have not deposited any funds into your wallet, you may simply re-install and create a new wallet when the update comes out (do not send any coins to your wallet in the meantime).\n\n5. If you cannot send money and you **have not** saved the backup, we will have a manual diagnostic process to help you. Please contact us (see the details below). **Do not delete the Mycelium Wallet and do not deposit more bitcoins into it**\n\nThe updated app will take several days or even a week to appear after the problem is identified and solved due to the App Store validation process.\n\nIf you have made a backup and you need to access your funds sooner, you may use the Android Mycelium Wallet and restore your backup there.\n\n### Manual diagnostic process\n\nWe ask every customer who can\'t access their coins and who **has not made a backup** to contact us by email at ios@mycelium.com. The process is tedious, so if you have a backup, please wait for the update to come out, or use the Android Mycelium Wallet to access the funds from your backup.\n\nIf you do not have the backup, please send us an email with the following information:\n\n1. Your device identifier (UDID, see below on how to find it).\n2. Your contact email.\n\nNote 1: Do not delete the existing installation of your wallet! If you do, you will irrevocably lose all the information that may help with recovering your funds.\n\nNote 2: We do not want, nor need your personal identifying information. If you have privacy concerns, please use a temporary email address and Tor if needed. Just make sure the email address you provide will work for a few days so we can contact you back.\n\nNote 3: Your device identifier is only necessary for us to be able to make a diagnostic build of the app for your device. Apple\'s app signing process requires that. Since 2013, no application (including Mycelium) has access to that identifier, so it\'s not possible to use it to track any of your activity on your iPhone. It\'s only good for installing builds during development outside the AppStore. See below for more information. If you are still concerned about privacy implications, you may wait for an AppStore-based build to come out and use that for diagnostic process.\n\nWe will send you back a diagnostic build of Mycelium Wallet and further instructions.\n\nThankfully not many people are affected, and we will work as fast as we can, but this could still take a few days to resolve. We will try to be very careful in order to successfully recover your funds.

I have a few comments, though.\n\n"The currency has also had a long run of troubles with hackers and fraud, most spectacularly in 2014 when the exchange Mt. Gox declared bankruptcy and bitcoins worth $460 million at the time evaporated." -- The bitcoins didn\'t evaporate. All bitcoins ever created are on the block chain, and always will be. Bitcoins can be stolen from their owners, or access to them can get lost. But they never, ever disappear or "evaporate". \n\n"The total in circulation as of January 2015 was approximately 13.7 million bitcoins, with circulation currently capped at 21 million." -- This makes it sound like the cap could be lifted any time. Maybe that\'s true in theory, but practically it\'s almost impossible. The cap is in the software, so it means the core Bitcoin developers have to propose changing or lifting the cap. Then, a majority of the Bitcoin miners/transaction processors would have to accept this change in the software. It\'s in nobody\'s interest to lift the cap, so it\'s very, very unlikely the developers will propose it, nor that the miners will accept it. Who in his right mind would vote in favour of watering down his bitcoin assets and income? \n\n"Purchased or mined bitcoins are stored in a digital wallet on the user\xe2\x80\x99s computer or mobile device. If the digital keys are lost, damaged or stolen, the bitcoins are gone." -- Bitcoin (keys) can also be stored offline, on a piece of paper if needed. Also, making backups of keys is easy, and should be standard practice for any wallet that contains more than a few dollars worth of bitcoin. So losing access to your bitcoin due to loss or damage of keys is really unnecessary. Protecting bitcoin from theft is a different matter. For serious amounts of bitcoin offline storage (so called \'cold storage\') is certainly recommended. Another way to protect your savings from theft is using a multi-signature wallet, requiring two (or more) signatures to authorize a transaction.

The left axis is for USD and the right axis is for BTC.\n\n* btc = BTC tipped per day, minus refunded tips, added to the sum of previous days\n* usd = BTC tipped per day, minus refunded tips, multiplied by the daily average USD price, then added to the sum of previous days\n* usd + refunds = BTC tipped per day, including refunded tips, multiplied by the daily average USD price, then added to the sum of previous days\n\n\n*[Cumulative Tip Volume](http://i.imgur.com/LH9HSYT.png)*\n\n\nThis last chart is interesting to me, but I'm not sure what we can glean from it. It shows the USD and BTC amounts tipped per day on a log scale. I interpret it as showing that 1) tip volume decreases when the price of bitcoin decreases, and 2) the divergence of the two lines indicates that the *btc amount* of tips has continued to grow, the *usd amount* of those tips has decreased due to the sustained bear market. For example, when 1000 bits were tipped one year ago, they were worth $.55, but today that same tip is only worth $.25... Maybe I can visualize this in Excel with some more time, but it's not a high priority right now.\n\n*[Daily Tip Volume](http://i.imgur.com/I0aiZyr.png)*": 2, 'looool': 2, '>You can name him /u/Changetip_Bashco\n\nGreat Idea /u/rydan This is the best way to distinguish your mod account from your changetip account.

Neither can a person be compelled to do anything against his or her will, for each person is ultimately responsible for his or her own actions. Governments try to terrorize individuals into submitting to tyranny by grabbing their bodies as hostages and trying to destroy their spirits. This strategy is not successful against the person who harbors the Stoic attitude toward life, and who refuses to allow pain to disturb the equanimity of his or her mind, and the exercise of reason. A government might destroy one\'s body or property, but it cannot injure one\'s philosophy of life. - Furthermore, the voluntaryist rejects the use of political power because it can only be exercised by implicitly endorsing or using violence to accomplish one\'s ends. The power to do good to others is also the power to do them harm. Power to compel people, to control other people\'s lives, is what political power is all about. It violates all the basic principles of voluntaryism: might does not make right; the end never justifies the means; nor may one person coercively interfere in the life of another. Even the smallest amount of political power is dangerous. First, it reduces the capacity of at least some people to lead their own lives in their own way. Second, and more important from the voluntaryist point of view, is what it does to the person wielding the power: it corrupts that person\'s character."\n\n-http://voluntaryist.com/fundamentals/introduction.html': 1, "He's not saying the EO doesn't exist, he's saying he doesn't think it applies to Snowden.\n\nI'd like to see a bit more deeper analysis of that myself.": 6, 'Happy cake day!': 4, "There's the soldiers who throw themselves in front of bullets and those who legitimately overthrow their opponent.

Perfect security will completely nullify freedom.  Some might ask what is the point of security without freedom.  Hence the notion behind "[g]ive me liberty, or give me death."\n\nWith that as a guiding principle, we, the people, in order to secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our posterity, have codified and adhered ourselves to a written Constitution.  We demand our elected officials take oath to abide in our Constitution.  When, in the most justifiable notion of security, those officials tread on that Constitution it is an affront to the very liberty they claim to be protecting.  In order to protect us from one tyrant another, more dangerous, is then created.  As C.S. Lewis put it, "[o]f all tyrannies, a tyranny sincerely exercised for the good of its victims may be the most oppressive."  \n\nWhether you share the same position is a personal matter, but surely your intellect will allow you to at least appreciate the opposing viewpoint.  After all, it is the opposing viewpoint that has lead to and maintained the freedom you wish to secure.  I hope no attrocity occurs, either through external means, or through internal oppresive subjectification.  But I\'m not willing to give up my liberty simply to protect it.

Release candidates are test runs for releases, when no critical\nproblems are found the release candidate will be tagged as 0.10.1.\n\nPlease report bugs using the issue tracker at github:\n\n  https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues\n\nUpgrading and downgrading\n=========================\n\nHow to Upgrade\n--------------\n\nIf you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely\nshut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), then run the\ninstaller (on Windows) or just copy over /Applications/Bitcoin-Qt (on Mac) or\nbitcoind/bitcoin-qt (on Linux).\n\nDowngrade warning\n------------------\n\nBecause release 0.10.0 and later makes use of headers-first synchronization and\nparallel block download (see further), the block files and databases are not\nbackwards-compatible with pre-0.10 versions of Bitcoin Core or other software:\n\n* Blocks will be stored on disk out of order (in the order they are\nreceived, really), which makes it incompatible with some tools or\nother programs. Reindexing using earlier versions will also not work\nanymore as a result of this.\n\n* The block index database will now hold headers for which no block is\nstored on disk, which earlier versions won\'t support.\n\nIf you want to be able to downgrade smoothly, make a backup of your entire data\ndirectory. Without this your node will need start syncing (or importing from\nbootstrap.dat) anew afterwards. It is possible that the data from a completely\nsynchronised 0.10 node may be usable in older versions as-is, but this is not\nsupported and may break as soon as the older version attempts to reindex.\n\nThis does not affect wallet forward or backward compatibility.\n\nNotable changes\n===============\n\nThis is a minor release and hence there are no notable changes.\nFor the notable changes in 0.10 refer to the release notes for the\n0.10.0 release at https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/v0.10.0/doc/release-notes.md\n\n0.10.1 Change log\n=================\n\nDetailed release notes follow.

But, if you're doing this for a large enough value when the overall valuation Bitcoin is comparatively low, you will see enormous slippage *and*, if you wait to conduct your transaction, you risk the value you invested into the market eroding due to buying power leaving the market over time (OTOH this could move the other way if your large buy sparks a market bull run).

Mining was cheap in the past and anyone could do it. As a result bitcoin did not have much value. When more and more people learned that bitcoin mining was like free money they started getting into it and competition intensified. That pushed up the cost of generating new bitcoins and the value of all bitcoins as well. The only way you could keep mining cheap is if you did it artificially which you can't in a decentralized system with no one in charge and no restrictions on participation.": 0, "I fully understand the process that gave bitcoin value.  I was involved and did some mining a long time back.  Over the years of playing with it I decided it isn't really a fair system just like all the other economic systems we've built this far.  So I came up with some ideas for change.  I think what you guys seem to be misunderstanding is that what gives this currency idea value is the actual value of performing a task as opposed to mineing and changing difficulty of hashes.  I'm not entirely sure how to handle that process, but I think the algorithm I am beginning to formulate involves humans, but I would like to do things in such a way that no one human could change value or control inflation.  Those things would have to be collaboratively dealt with.  To simplify what I was trying to express above the value of the currency would be inexorably tired to the actual value of labor.  If the above doesn't make sense, how could one achieve this idea?": 1, "There is quite obviously a price mechanism, maybe not a yraditiobsl one.   I would appreciate helpful feedback.  Like here is why this wouldn't work and here is how to make it work.  I just want the value of the currency to be based more on the value of work and to put the mechanism for controlling that mechanism back in the hands of the masses.  For example you could have a union of workers that could force a vote on the price of a service.  I thought there were some good ideas above.
