The pre-money utility or use-value of a commodity aids it in bridging the gap between commodity and money; and the reason a commodity might tend towards becoming money and maintain that status is if it has good monetary properties (i.e. fungibility, durability, divisibility, scarcity, etc.).  It is a rocky path for any commodity to bridge this price gap, and without central, coercive decree, there is no good easy way to get lots of people holding and valuing the commodity in the first place, such that it can easily emerge as a unit of indirect exchange, other than by it\'s use value (or what some people call "intrinsic" value), and also by the persuasion of entrepreneurs who help others to see the future or potential value of the thing as money.\n\nA bitcoin, arguably, has less non-monetary use-value than other prior money commodities such as gold or grain, etc. so it may have a larger gap to bridge, so to speak.  But it does have much value already, and it is indeed a share of a very valuable network, called the Bitcoin network.  But in any case, there is a large pricing and liquidity and adoption gap which needs to be bridged in order for bitcoin to become money.\n\nThe point is this: when you understand what I\'ve just explained, and you perceive how far bitcoin is from monetary status and liquidity: just stop and contemplate the  amount of demand that will necessarily come to bear on the bitcoin market (assuming it does continue towards money). . . or on the other hand, imagine how unlikely it is that holders and merchants, and investors will continue to value the bitcoin unit in its current state; if it seems destined to remain in this state. . . if it does not become money and achieve that virtuous cycle of monetary demand and liquidity and become the most universal reference, the unit of account in the (or an) economy.\n\nNo, wishing for price stability right now, or trying to stabilize the price swings by fighting psychology and preaching temperance is probably a vain endeavor.  Bitcoin either dies away (maybe finds some small niche), or it\'s unit purchasing power (exchange price) goes much, much higher than it is now. . . and there is no stopping the volatility which will accompany that type of action.': 2}, ('Bitcoin Price?', 11): {'Winkdex is time average over many exchanges.\n\nI think bitpay goes through all the exchanges.\n\nBut Bitpay and Coinbase are brokerages.

Mr. Maxwell lamented that all these bounties produced no long-term developers.\n\nThe work Hearn\'s site is paying for has a huge premium.  He has two problems: he wants people to work in bitcoins instead of, say, insurance (increased risk), and he wants short-term contracts (increased risk).  His model is flawed because he can\'t pay the amount necessary to get good developers to take these risks.  I\'d imagine that a developer with a job at Google or at a bank would want 2x his current salary to change to this sort of work.\n\nThe reason it costs so much more is because these workers need to consider the time they will be out of work if either bitcoins fail or the contract runs out.  They could work for 6 months and then spend 3 months pounding the pavement for a new job.  And at that new job, they won\'t be a supervisor anymore and have to start at the bottom with a lower salary.  Finally, they now have a shredded resume and will be viewed as someone who changes jobs too frequently, lowing future salary potential.  These factors easily cost a 2x risk premium.  That\'s before considering health insurance, which can cost $600/month for a plan that is actually comparable to an employer plan (not the "bronze" plans on the marketplace) and is not included in these bounties.': 3, 'gmaxwell is just jealous, as usual': -9, 'As far as I understand it, this is a very important enabler of larger block sizes, which in turn is one proposed solution for transaction rate scalability.\n\nI say "enabler", because as blocks get larger, while other parameters such as the 10 minute block interval stay the same, you run into issues such as slow propagation, and from it, a significantly higher orphan rate, which can be a problem. From my calculation, a 20MB block would take about 10.5 seconds to be verified by each node before it gets sent to the next nodes, out of a 600 second block interval, and it becomes apparent that this would cause a high orphan rate, which incentivizes centralization of mining nodes. So this optimization has a similar effect to Gavin\'s recent ~~headers-first~~ [invertible bloom filters](https://gist.github.com/gavinandresen/e20c3b5a1d4b97f79ac2) work (more about it on [LTB](https://letstalkbitcoin.com/blog/post/lets-talk-bitcoin-169-set-reconciliation-and-the-block-with-gavin-andresen)) - blocks can propagate faster, which also ultimately helps keep the network more decentralized.': 10, 'If programmers could drop the mic, I think this how it would look.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/BeGloHp.gif (credit to /u/fwaggle for posting image)': 118, 'I look at downtrends and uptrends in terms of price, because I think that price neatly summarizes all of the relevant factors in the bitcoin economy.  People like to look at transaction volume (which includes spam) or VC money (which means little), but it\'s all secondary.  If people want to use bitcoins, they have to buy them.  If they don\'t, then they don\'t buy any.  Price also captures the idea of people viewing bitcoin as "sketchy," because we\'ll know when that view disappears when price rises.  News articles, merchant acceptance, and the like all tend to follow price.  \n\nI don\'t think that it\'s worth people\'s effort to start "pitching" bitcoins to anyone.  It\'s the same reason why I disagree with the idea that bitcoins are too difficult to understand for the average person.  People like to lie about lots of things, and they come up with excuses.  Smartphones are actually very difficult to use and are incredibly complex, but few people say "I\'m not going to use a smartphone because it\'s too difficult to use."  I run a mining pool and I often find myself searching the Internet for how to do something with a smartphone.  People teach themselves to use phones when their friends want to send them text messages.\n\nThe same would happen with bitcoins if people wanted to use them.  There are plenty of wallets available where you just point a phone at a code and click "Send."  It\'s not difficult to understand the concept of a bitcoin address and sending money online.  People who fall victim to CryptoLocker schemes and don\'t have backups have no problem going to Localbitcoins sellers and asking them for help to pay the ransom.\n\nPeople will learn to do things when there is a demand to do them, which is why it\'s a waste of effort to pitch bitcoin adoption to people.  The real solution to increasing bitcoin adoption is very simple: get OpenBazaar up and running.  Once that happens, the ability to buy things at lower prices than they are sold on eBay will cause these "confused" people to come around quickly.': 2, 'Obama drops the mic hard core. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X9tuwH9I5Q': 7, 'One of us, one of us!

Maybe it could be considered an organization or a pseudo-organism or something else. At least there should be some sort of reciprocity. If merely saying something (which didn't lead to any harm as in e.g. threatening murder) was unacceptable to that group, then indeed there wouldn't be much of a point saying anything at all *within that group*, or listening to anything that came from that group. If there was no meaningful communication, then what society can there be? Society could only exist outside of the framework of such a group and that group, as a whole and separately, wound not be part of any society, unless and until it changes fundamentally.\n\n> I would think that bitcoin is a good example of behavior that emerges out of distributed decisions to make a collective decision. Think of a society as a group of people following a protocol (I'm not saying its good or bad)\n\nYes, I too believe that Bitcoin is something that enhances society.\n\n>     You can also avoid the financial or physical harm.\n> \n> A cult such as NAZI socialism can get so big that it becomes very difficult to avoid financial harm. When part of the protocol is to be shunned and have your wealth taken and it is the dominant protocol in your geographical area then you are most likely screwed no matter what you do. Leaving means leaving much of your wealth behind, staying means taking the chance of death or loss of wealth if there is a fork in the protocol that puts it at odds with your existence. Sure its all individuals carrying out the behavior but its not one individual but many that have their behavior reinforced both by the propaganda and but threats from other individuals affected by the propaganda.\n> \n>     Then you need to also consider any financial or social gain, net everything out, and it might very well turn out that it's worth telling the truth.\n> \n> I would assume wealth generated before the existence of an cult (or its movement into your geographical area) is wealth that is seen as a starting point that can be lost.\n\nIt's a matter of good life decisions to identify a bad cult early on and act early on and not try to cheat destiny compromising with your values or being complacent. If you act earlier you will not incur much or any loss. If you've been fooled to trust the cult for a time, you should swallow your loss and move on. If you are at a point where you have no other choice but leaving wealth behind or dying not letting go, then you have to re-evaluate that wealth. You might have the subjective opinion that a property has value, but if you can't sell it or maintain your claim over it, haven't you already lost it?\n\nWealth and value are things that only exist in a society. As per the first definition above, if there is no *agreement* then it would not be a society, no matter how many people there are or how consistently they seem to behave.\n\n> The only way I see you can be sure of a net benefit is if a cult excludes itself from using force or fraud when interacting with others. Then you can be sure all interactions are mutually beneficial.\n\nIt's not the only way.

That's a much more common occurrence and more likely scenario and it fits the verifiable facts of what happened.   So unless there is strong evidence to the contrary, that would be the more likely explanation.\n\nI'm willing to guess you see lots of conspiracies going on in the world around you.
