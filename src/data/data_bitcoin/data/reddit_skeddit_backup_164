In a car, just because you need to go fast doesn\'t always mean it is safe to do so.\n\nBitcoin is a massive engineering challenge. And it\'s easy to look at your own internet speed and say "I can download a 10MB block every second, why can\'t miners do it every 10 minutes?" but there\'s a lot more to relay and validation than just sending a block from a data center 2000 miles away to your home computer. You have to get a block all the way around the world in about 3 seconds for mining to have minimal centralization pressure, and that includes getting the block to miners in rural areas and off-grid areas (especially because that\'s where electricity tends to be cheap). And if miners are spending 10% of their budget on Internet connections, that\'s 8% less revenue than the competition that is 5x as large but only needs the same internet infrastructure.\n\nThe engineering challenges and infrastructure requirements of large blocks are substantially more than most people assume the first time they look at the problem.\n\nAnd miner centralization is also a much bigger deal than most people realize. The miners have power over the network. Miners can enforce *any* soft-fork they want at 51% hashpower. When there are 3 miners that make up 51%, that\'s only 3 miners the government needs to hack/bribe/coerce. That\'s only 3 miners who need to talk and decide the minimum fee for transactions is 2% instead of a flat rate.

When a miner finds a block, all of the other miners are mining on an outdated chain until they hear about the block. If it takes 60 seconds on average for a block to make it to a miner, they waste 10% of their hashing power on old blocks.\n\nThe propagation time for a miner who finds their own blocks is 0 seconds. A miner with 33% hashing power will on average waste only 7% hashing power - a 3% revenue advantage over the miner with only 1% hashrate. Because margins are low, 3% revenue can translate to 30%+ profit, which makes a huge difference in terms of viability, threatening to kill off the smaller miners (because mining is 0-sum).\n\nIn HK, the miners decided collectively that 0.5% orphan rate advantage is acceptable, anything more is not really. For small miners, that means hearing about a new block within 3 seconds (on average) of the bigger miners.\n\nToday's numbers I believe are closer to 6 seconds for stratum pools. So we're already behind the acceptable target for keeping smaller miners profitable.\n\nRequiring miners to have upgraded internet infrastructure is also not acceptable. If a miner needs to spend $25,000 on Internet upgraded, that's 10% of a $250,000 setup, but only 1% of a $2.5M setup. The miner that only has $250,000 is not going to be able to compete.

Ironically enough, its Luke-Jr's fork that includes the ability to turn off RBF, code which didn't make it into core.\n\nA lot of the controversial decisions by core are reversible without needing to change consensus rules. So where is the software fork that follows the popular decisions? But, all the existing software forks change the consensus rules as well. And most of them are considered to be highly dangerous (namely XT and BU). \n\nTo call the current vision for Bitcoin core 'blockstream's centralization' is to misunderstand the vision. People villianize the lightning network without understanding how it works. Hubs shouldn't be necessary on lightning. There will probably be large hubs, but that comes with both trust agility and high fault tolerance. And, hubs will be largely avoidable for implementations that wish to avoid hubs, though it might come at a premium (avoiding hubs = need more channels = more txn fees).\n\nWith lighting, all you need is a few transactions per year per person. 3tps is enough for tens of millions of people. 500tps is enough for the whole world (barely). We've got a long way to go, but more tech improvements could make it so that 50tps is enough, or even 10tps.\n\nPeople get so fixated on the block size but that's not where you are going to get strong scalability. Without lightning, you'd need orders of magnitude more block space to get the same economic activity. Lighting is just one technology.\n\nThe block size will be going up. It won't be 1mb forever. With segwit its effectively 1.75. I guarantee you that won't be the last increase. With weak blocks and other forms of preconsensus, 20MB seems in reach. With the block cost stuff that maaku is working on, more improvements will be seen.\n\nBut doing it safely takes time, and most of the people who have put most of the work into Bitcoin and Bitcoin-core over the past 2-5 years disagree with just raising the block size. That's enough to convince me that alternate approaches or philosophies should be altcoins.\n\nI don't agree with all the moderation that has been happening, but I don't feel like there is a better place.

There will be a [NEW ASSET] / Bitcoin markets within hours of its invention, and it would be years before it would trade against even the largest of fiat currencies.\n\nIf you need proof of this, look at the altcoin market.  Every one trades against Bitcoin almost as soon as it's invented, some of the larger ones sometimes trade against Litecoin and that's it. None of them trade for USD, except occassionally Litecoin which is #2 of several thousand and has been around for years.\n\nIf you think there will be a successor to Bitcoin and you want to be the earliest to get into it, the only logical move is to hold Bitcoin in preparation.  As an added bonus, in the more likely case that this revolutionary technology doesn't arrive so soon after Bitcoin itself, you benefit from the growing wave of Bitcoin adoption instead.\n\nEdit: This is all beside the point anyway.  Your original analogy to social networks is clearly flawed and irrelevant as explained here:\n\nhttp://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool/why-bitcoin-will-continue-to-grow/\n\n> Social networks are a familiar and often-cited example of the network effect. Facebook and G+ both have a lot of nice features, but the feature that makes Facebook so much more useful is that all your friends are already on it. Thus, it is really the network that uses Facebook that makes it valuable.\n\n> This example can be confusing when analogized to currencies. Facebook and G+ have the property that either can be used at a low opportunity cost of using another. In other words, if I am already spending some time crafting the most narcissistic Facebook status update that I can think of, there is little additional effort to posting it on G+ too. Both Facebook and Google support chat protocols, so there is little additional effort to using a program such as Jitsi that can run both protocols and log me in to both services simultaneously. Thus, it is possible for a social network to succeed without diminishing the size of the others. It can expect to attract members without necessarily drawing them away from the others.\n\n> However, for currencies the situation is different. Owning any one currency carries a high opportunity cost of owning any other. I cannot use the same money to buy an investment in bitcoins and in silver coins or Canadian dollars. If I want more of one, I necessarily must have less of another. If any one currency is acknowledged to be the winner over the rest, then there is no additional benefit for anyone to own other currencies.\n\n> While it is possible for two social networks to coexist, the world is not big enough for two currencies. Any initial disparity between two currencies, no matter how small, positively reinforces itself, and there is no reason to expect this effect to end until one currency is driven out of existence. As the price of currency A begins to rise relative to currency B, holders of currency B begin to see that their investment is looking less and less reasonable. As more people flee currency B, its decline accelerates until it has effectively ceased to be a currency.\n\n> This conclusion does not appear to be borne out by our everyday experience of different national currencies within each nation-state. This is explained by the fact that these states typically have legislation such as legal tender laws and capital controls that artificially reduces the usefulness of other currencies within their respective borders. There is no jurisdiction in which Bitcoin is legally privileged, so there is no group of people required to treat it differently than any other. Thus, there is no reason to expect Bitcoin ever to be in a stable equilibrium with national currencies, the way that they are in equilibrium with one another.

I could always convert USD to BTC a few hours before I\'m planning on converting the BTC to the new digital currency.  Doing it that way mostly eliminates my exposure to BTC price changes.  There\'s no reason to sit on BTC for a year for the purpose of later converting it to something else.  \n  As for the question of why sell out now - in any market, there is "fast money" and "slow money."  The "fast money" are the corporate insiders and professional traders (real professionals at hedge funds with 8 and 9 figure trading books, not these whale club kids) who get information before everyone else.  I used to be a professional commodity trader at a hedge fund.  I would never try to time the commodity market now that I\'m no longer at a hedge fund.  Competing against professionals in their arena is stupid.  Similarly, I\'m "slow money" in digital currencies.  By the time I have a level of confidence that a successor to bitcoin has arrived, the bitcoin price will probably have already fallen 75%+, because the "smart money" will have moved already.  \n\n\n  I like the article you linked to and agree with it in general.  The critical point though is that nothing in there requires bitcoin to be the eventual winner.  Bitcoin\'s current network size mean that an upstart currency can\'t just be a tiny bit better to compete against it - few people will abandon bitcoin for something a tiny bit better.

The 1mb block limit is an anti spam measure, nothing else. So as long as there is no spam attack on the bitcoin network, fees should be irrelevant, as miners are mining for the block reward.

Not including transactions would destroy Bitcoin's utility, and the miner's investment would become worthless.\n\n>  then the Tragedy of the Commons kicks in.\n\nThat's actually a good point. But the only reason for a miner NOT to include a transaction is if there is a cost associated with doing so. But the direct cost (as in increased usage of resources) of including a transaction in a block is absolutely marginal. However, there is an indirect cost of including a transaction in a block because a larger block has a higher orphaning risk, which would mean losing the mining reward. The best estimate of this cost can be found in [Peter R.'s paper regarding the emergent fee market in absence of a block limit](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/43331625/feemarket.pdf).\n\n": 2, 'Best estimate for what?

There is nothing that says that we "need" [eight hundred thousand trillion hashes per second](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3xwwnj/eight_hundred_thousand_trillion_hashes_per_second/). That is simply the result of the current incentive given by the block reward and the bitcoin price. Fees are not needed in this equation yet.\n\nThe reason why we do have fees despite a high block reward is a different one: it\'s an anti spam measure! The 1mb block limit is an anti spam measure, nothing else. So as long as there is no spam attack on the bitcoin network, fees should be irrelevant, as miners are mining for the block reward. Only when the network needs to prioritze transactions to prevent spam, then a "fee market" should temporarily develop.\n\nUnfortunately the 1 mb limit can now no longer efficiently act as an anti spam measure, because legitimate transactions are regularly filling it up already.
