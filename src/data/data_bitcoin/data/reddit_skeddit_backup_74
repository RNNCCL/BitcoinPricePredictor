This could be a game changer for bitcoin. If this proposal is accepted how long do you feel it would be before we could first see it in use? ': 3, 'Protecting against this would be up to developers, similar to how you manage spam e-mail and social media "friend" requests now.\n\nFor example, your wallet could be set up to ignore all messages that don\'t include credentials that match up to a whitelist of people you know and trust. Once you add someone to the list by exchanging credentials, their wallet can transact with yours seamlessly in the background with no further action from you.': 1, 'This will create more *demand* for payment space on the blockchain. Block size controls *supply* of payment space.': 5, 'I like': 2, 'BIP47 is an on-chain solution which requires one to send Bitcoin to the recipient to establish a connection and add additional data to the blockchain. This can weaken privacy, as anyone who knows Bob\'s "notification address" can see all the people who have sent Bob a notification transaction (BIP47 says the sender must send the notification transaction from an address that is not associated with them, but that can be quite difficult!). Also, sending a notification transaction to every person you may want to transact with can be costly, take a lot of time, and bloat the blockchain.\n\nWith our solution, all the back-and-forth takes place outside of the Blockchain, so privacy is preserved, communications are quick, and there are many more options for getting the message from point A to B.\n\nImagine 100 people go to a networking event and add each other to their wallets. Wallet developers want transactions to be able to be sent quickly, so each wallet is designed to get to work negotiating receive addresses in the background as soon as a new addressee is added.\n\nUsing BIP47, this would result in (99^2 + 99) / 2 = 4950 "notification transactions" being sent to the blockchain. Now imagine there are millions of these events going on around the world, and the number of transactions quickly becomes enough to overwhelm the Bitcoin network and cost a lot of Bitcoin.\n\nWith our solution this number of connections would be easy to handle, wouldn\'t cost very much, and nothing would appear on the Blockchain until an actual transaction had taken place.\n\nOne last point advantage to our system is avoiding "dead" addresses. Using the BIP47 model it would be possible for Alice to keep sending transactions to Bob even if Bob permanently loses his wallet. With our system, the recipient\'s wallet must be functioning for them to provide a receive address, so it becomes much harder to accidentally send funds to an outdated address (where they risk being lost forever).': 9, "Right now, where would you send a link requesting bitcoin?\n\nWhile there is a layer of security, the idea is similar to publishing contact information for anyone with bitcoin.  Scammers will use that data to fool people, and request money.\n\nConsider how often you see requests for money over email.  What happens if your email account also is your bitcoin wallet?  I understand that I'm oversimplifying, but I think others aren't considering the possibility because spam filtering is normally so successful.": 1, 'Except Bitcoin addresses are single-use.': 2, 'My feedback is that this is an interesting idea that people are likely to support, but I\'d like to see there be certainty written into the BIP that the standard, currently used address types (by which I mean the long, alphanumeric addresses) would remain.  (If it\'s truly flexible it should let you do things with the current address model as well as the one you propose.)  There will be use cases where the current address types will be needed (and the off-chain short-naming might not be compatible, or other cases where the short-name address would be more desireable). \n\n\nAnother comment is that the address book model should be managed from within the user wallet (information which is stored on the user\'s computer), much like the idea of where private keys should be held with a user in an application managed by the user, rather than in a web wallet where the private keys are often controlled by a company (not by the individual user). In the case of web wallets the address feature should be made an element of data that is within direct user control rather than one which is handled by a company / service or third party.  In the event that the data must be held by a company or service it should be kept out of their sight ([zero knowledge](http://zeroknowledgeprivacy.org/) configuration).  At no time should the user\'s address book data be able to be seen or accessed by a company / service / third party.  (This is particularly important in part due to the passage of [a very sneaky provision in the US cromnibus about a year ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/2rkt1u/coinbase_give_us_the_right_to_run_your_credit/cnh1y9l).)\n\n\nThe final point is more subtle but also important.  Where you get into address books and how people are named or choose to name themselves then identity comes into play.  In no way should firms or a state be able to regulate anyone\'s identity.  There must be no conventions to say that you have to disclose a first name, last name, gender, and so forth.  Some corporations that already effectively regulate people\'s identities for AML/KYC as a condition of using their "wallets" are doing a disservice to the community.': 2, 'Namecoin is much more than that, it lets you to associate an unique name with up to 500 bytes of data.

When I was new to Bitcoin, the idea of an "address" was immediately intuitive.\n\nAs the technology developed, a clear argument surfaced for only using a given address once. Cool. However, many people continue to use the same address repeatedly with no consequences, because the detriments do not apply to them. But let\'s assume everyone should absolutely not be re-using Bitcoin addresses...\n\nSo you were saying, we should stop using the terminology "address" because it is misleading. I just think that isn\'t true-- especially when you have a look at Bitcoin\'s audience which is still mostly programmers (I think).\n\nFirstly, you don\'t use someone\'s bitcoin address to receive money from them. You use someone\'s bitcoin address to send money to them, and if you\'re doing Bitcoin correctly, once you generate an address and it\'s out there, you never delete the private key, because what if you or someone else accidentally sends to that address?\n\nSecondly, this isn\'t the first time "addresses" have been transient. Not by a long shot. Memory addresses come to mind-- extremely transient.\n\nSure you can say there are no "bitcoins" either as another poster mentioned and I get what you\'re saying, I do, and it has some technical validity, it does, but it is just more confusing your way, not the other way around.

": 1, "> BIP70 is fine for large companies who have their own always-on webservers\n\nIs e-mail only for large companies who have their own always-on webservers? We don't expect everyone to run their own server for receiving payments; in fact, our proposal is basically a way to allow BIP70 to be used with a third party server so users don't have to provide their own. People would sign up for a service that does the hosting for them, just like signing up for an e-mail address. The beauty of our proposal is that you can trust a third party to run the server for you without the risk of them reading the content of your messages or sending messages on your behalf, unlike a standard mail server. It would also be possible to create an anonymous server that requires no registration at all (and can still be trusted).\n\nYou are correct that BIP70 (and our service) requires the receiving device to be on to issue a payment address. However that doesn't mean you can't use it in a similar fashion to BIP47. If you are afraid the recipient might go offline, you could request 10 receive addresses in advance, and queue them up for when you want to use them. Or you could use our protocol to request a BIP32 X-pub and generate receive addresses to your heart's content--although this isn't specifically supported by our specification, I don't see any reason why you couldn't use it that way. Our protocol is meant to be flexible so developers can design services to work however they want.": 7, '> People would sign up for a service that does the hosting for them, just like signing up for an e-mail address.\n\nThis is great for people in the server hosting business.\n\nBIP-47 was designed to allow individuals to not require the assistance of third party servers for full functionality.\n\nAny protocol that does not require interactive communication will always offer a superset of functionality compared to one that does require it.': -2, "I think this opens a door for scammers.

The difference between my nodes and regular core nodes is this: if there's concensus to hard fork to 2MB blocks, my nodes will accept it and play along. Once it happens, core adds the 2mb max size code to their code (otherwise their branch dies into obscurity) and we all switch back to core nodes. The fear of a hard fork for 2mb blocks will have passed, and the team can continue their excellent work.

I\'m not sure the situation with bitcoin is analogous, because the distance between the origin and destination of a bitcoin transaction is inconsequential to how long it uses the network.  It\'s more likely that a doubling of the block size will allow for a doubling of the transactional capacity before the same amount of congestion happens.\n\n2) Regardless, eventually 2MB blocks will fill up -- so this isn\'t a "solution".  It\'s a mitigation strategy.  And there\'s nothing wrong with leveraging a mitigation strategy in the short-term while you working on a long term solution.\n\nThat\'s the larger point of my comment.
