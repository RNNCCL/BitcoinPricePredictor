If it\'s not part of the bitcoin exchange, is there any advantage to buying from Coinbase?\n\n"bitcoin" is simply an application built on top of the blockchain protocol. There are no businesses or companies that are directly controlled by bitcoin, anyone who participates in bitcoin is simply a part of it. Coinbase is one exchange, there are several with different advantages and disadvantages. For example, www.circle.com lets you buy with a credit card, but they charge a little more and have lower limits. Coinbase is well regarded, but they require you to link your bank account. \n\n> Another question: I\'m looking at a 1 yr chart for bitcoin. Not so good for people who bought in early this year. Do you guys think the $300 level is about where it bottoms out? Or should we expect a continued slide lower next year. I realize nobody has a crystal ball, just interested in sentiment.\n\nThe general sentiment is a mix of two perspectives:\n\n1. "WTF!? This can\'t possibly get ANY worse. What the hell is wrong with the bitcoin market!?"\n2. "Hold on boys, this rocket is going to launch ANY SECOND!"\n\n> Do most people hold bitcoin for transactions (similar to a Paypal account) or for an investment?\n\nMost people continue to hold bitcoin based on its future potential, though many of us are eager to support businesses that support bitcoin.': 3, 'To add to this, if you check out the sticky post in this sub, you can see all the various Bitcoin exchanges and more. ': 4, 'Bitcoin is useful for transactions (it\'s actually easier to use than credit cards, once you get the hang of the software), but the price is supported by holders (aka "hoarders").  The limited supply of the currency, coupled with the growing acceptance and uses, are what drive the price higher.  The bubble that occurred in December of last year was typical for the currency, which has hype cycles where people get greedy, followed by crashes where people get fearful.  But underlying all that is real, steady growth in the number of new users.': 2, 'There is no one "bitcoin exchange" there are many bitcoin exchanges out there.

": 1, 'Coinbase charges ~2% for bitcoin purchases. Bitstamp requires that you internationally wire money (Which cost me ~$30 when I did it), plus there is a .5% fee per trade. I suggest you take the dollar amount you would like to purchase and do the math. That will tell you which one has an advantage (As far as price goes).\n\nI do not think 300 is the bottom, but I have a pretty strong feeling that 275 is the bottom. That\'s unless we get some really really bad news, in which case I could see $180 to $120 coins again. \n\nI think most people hold bitcoin as an investment, but also use it for transactions at the same time. Holding bitcoin makes me compelled to use it.\n\nKeep reading, make up your own mind about buying.

In fact, they had better **not** do that, because otherwise a large bitcoin miner could squash a budding sidechain with only a small fraction of his hashpower. So, the computational resources of the sidechains would  most surely not contribute to the security of the bitcoin blockchain.': 0, '> People scared of sidechains:\n> altcoiners\n\nAre they scared? Why?  \n\nAs far as I can tell, altcoins are *already* sidechains. \n\nFor example, take the Litecoin protocol and network plus all the exchanges that trade Litecoin. Isn\'t that a sidechain (the LiteSideChan, LSC)?  \n\n* When someone deposits BTC into one of those exchanges, those BTC are effectively "frozen"on the blockchain (the original owner cannot move them anymore), and are effectively "transferred" to the LSC;\n\n* When someone withdraws BTC from some of those exchanges,  the corresponding BTC in the blockchain, that were "frozen" and assigned to the LSC, are unfrozen and moved to that person\'s address.\n\nAlso, each exchange that trades BTC is a sidechain.   Bitpay is a sidechain.  BitFunder and Hashie.co were sidechains.   Isn\'t it so?': -7, 'But where in the paper does it say that sidechains *have* to be distributed, public, etc?  How will that be enforced?  What are those "certain rules", and who is "everyone"? (Banks and governments too?)\n\nIndeed, Bitpay is all you say.  But sidechains can be all that too.': -1, 'A blockchain and all attached sidechains are distributed.  Everything on a blockchain is public and obeys certain rules that everyone agrees on.\n\nBitpay is a company which is closed source and can be scammed, hacked, and shutdown.\n\n': 5, "It doesn't say that because it is implied by that fact that they are sidechains hanging off of Bitcoin and use merge mining with sha256 hashing POW to secure it.\n\nRemember, the only reason the sidechain project came into existence is because they want to piggyback on the massive sha256 infrastructure that secures Bitcoin.   They want to ride on top of Bitcoin.\n": 2, 'People scared of sidechains:\n\n- altcoiners\n- famous trolls like OP\n\nPeople who want sidechains:\n\n- bitcoiners, including the most respected members like Gregory Maxwell.': 10, 'Sure (although any project, no matter how stupid, will always find some believers willing to put money into it).  But the point is that a *secure* sidechain *cannot* use a protocol that is compatible with the bitcoin protocol.': 0, 'Firstly, I\'m not really a big supporter of side chains, but you seem to be missing the point.\n\n> As far as I can tell, since there is no clearing or overseeing of the sidechains by any entity, the sidechain can do absolutely anything at all\n\nThis is the point.  Currently to make any consensus changes to bitcoin, you need to get everyone to adopt a hard fork / soft fork.  Thus the pace of innovation is very slow.  We see much faster innovation happening in altcoins because anyone can create a new altcoin to do \'anything\', even destroy keys or use broken cryptography (although why would anyone use such a coin?).\n\nSo by making a small change to bitcoin (allowing sidechains), and only stipulating that coins can move onto a sidechain and back, it means there are no barriers to alternative blockchain implementations.  The users will decide which sidechains are useful and adoption will grow accordingly.  Bad sidechains won\'t get used.\n\nThe other benefit is that all of the hashing power from alt chains would be united and help to secure the main bitcoin chain.  And as the sidechains devs say, it unifies "digital scarcity" so that bitcoin is the one scarce asset that all other blockchains are backed by (although whether this is good or bad could be debated).': 14, "Why isn't it?": 0, 'PS.

Thus, I can feel okay that the Blockstream team is pursuing its corporate and fiduciary duty to promote this new technology and its view of the Bitcoin world. That's not evil. That's just business.\n\nWe don't have to agree with the Sidechains view of the world and we still have to see if we will ever use the product.\n\nSo, in the end, I don't think you're wrong, but I think a startup's gotta do what a startup's gotta do: Sell the dream! \n\nLet's not be ainters!": 8, 'I thought you said you read the white paper?\n\nHow can you say that Bitpay is a sidechain?\n\nI think you need to go back to step 1 and read the bitcoin whitepaper.

I ask because at this time of year, people are getting their tax paperwork together.\n\nIf you spent any bitcoin that increased more than 50c while you held it, you are responsible to pay taxes on the money you made by holding it. If you can prove that you held the BTC in an address for longer than a year, then your tax bill goes down on those gains. And it can be a significant discount when you prove when and where you held it. But if all the BTC just gets jumbled up together in a series of new addresses, you may not be able to prove how long you held the BTC before spending it.

It would be a real shame if someone doubled their tax bill because they didn\'t properly document when they acquired each balance and prove that the money sat in an address for over a year. The youngest BTC in an address sets the purchase date for that address, and if you were up when you spent, you\'d want to make sure you can prove you held for over a year before spending it. \n\nThat\'s part of the reason I want an app that shows me addresses that are safe to spend because it\'s up and has been sitting for at least a year, reducing the tax bill or is barely down, making it the small price to pay for non reportable events.

The past is a period of time where the infrastructure isn\'t quite ready yet.\n\nMy entire premise is that infrastructure is going up that will facilitate future usability, incentive, and thus demand. And when demand goes up, value increases. To be quite frank, you have absolutely zero evidence that the above statement is false. So you simply can\'t make the claim that the price won\'t go up. \n\nThat\'s my point. If you pay attention to what\'s going on out there, all signs point to growth.
