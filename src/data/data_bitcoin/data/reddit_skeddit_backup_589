We might for the most part have gotten rid of kings and queens, but the "democratic" nation states that replaced them have largely inherited or come to assume the same prerogatives and failure points. \n\nThe most important of these prerogatives has been the right to monopolise the printing presses, criminalising free market monies. Because of the critical value of money to economies, this power is the greatest any political actor can possess, the lynchpin to the continued survival and dominance of nation states. "With great power comes great responsibility", and all governments have been seduced into abusing this power and responsibility, at the expense of the wealth and wellbeing of their citizenries. It is only due to the insidious and dispersed nature of this damage, the complicity of citizenries in both demanding and being seduced by illusions of economic free lunches and easy fixes, and the difficulty of composing a solution to the problem, that governments have not been overthrown for these abuses.\n\nBitcoin is a breath of fresh air to the status quo. It is a solution to this problem, a single token the entire world can settle upon, which is immune to the political pressures and dangers which inevitably destroy centralised currencies. It is a guaranteed scarce commodity, which people will actually want to hold, unlike fiat currency, which people are constantly trying to flee from with bonds, stocks, and housing (creating useless, damaging economic distortions in the markets for these assets). Technologically it is almost infinitely superior and infinitely more future-ready than any fiat currency will ever be. Because it belongs to no one and everyone, anyone who chooses to hold it has an incentive to support and improve it. In contrast, fiat currencies only benefit the governments who control the printing presses.\n\nThe world only needs one arbitrarily overvalued scarce token, and Bitcoin has the momentum, the community, the network-effect, and the brand to be that token. It offers a sound, functional money, and an end to destructive government control are something which will benefit everyone on Earth, so the incentives motivating people to support and value Bitcoin are overwhelming.\n\nThe crowd is smarter than any government bureau. We are moving away from epochs of top-down control and distortion of economies, into an era of ever-increasing liberty, away from an era which corruptible government architects ostensibly "managed" and "cured" economic ills, to a time of flexible, organically developed and consensual systems. Bitcoin is a critical piece of that transition, because by adopting it we cut off governments from their ability to shield themselves from their dysfunction by endlessly printing more money. Bitcoin is the beginning of the end for the useless and destructive reign of government.': 1, 'Another block chain could succeed or surpass the bitcoin blockchain in its total value.

I have to quote Bauwens yet again: "P2P is often described as a \'gift economy\' (see Richard Barbrook for an example). However, it is our contention that this is somewhat misleading. The key reason is that peer to peer is not a form of equality matching; it is not based on reciprocity. P2P follows the adage: each contributes according to his capacities and willingness, and each takes according to his needs. There is no obligatory reciprocity involved. In the pure forms of peer production, producers are not paid. Thus, if there is \'gifting\' it is entirely non-reciprocal gifting, the use of peer-produced use-value does not create a contrary obligation." [source](http://www.informatik.uni-leipzig.de/~graebe/Texte/Bauwens-06.pdf)\n\nThey key distinction here is to recognize the difference between p2p economy and market economy. P2P economies "produce use-value through the free cooperation of producers who have access to distributed capital: this is the P2P production mode, a \'third mode of production\' different from for-profit or public production by state-owned enterprises. Its product is not exchange value for a market, but use-value for a community of users."\n\n> I do not know why you seek to make a magical exception for / give special treatment to certain trades\n\nBecause I find that p2p theory (as described by Bauwens) has much greater explanatory power than Austrian rationale. What\'s the Austrian answer as to why nodes upload the blockchain (even if they don\'t earn a fee for doing so)? What gift do they receive in return?\n\n> but given what you\'ve said so far, I have started to suspect it\'s for ideological reasons -- seems to me that you don\'t want to abandon your beliefs, therefore you must play these word games\n\nfunny, I think that\'s what you (and justusranvier) are doing. Twisting clients and servers (even though thats a false dichotomy of p2p architecture) into consumers and suppliers, and miner centralization into "specialization / division of labor".\n\n> In the old code, when you sent money directly to an IP address, you did not have to pay any transaction fee to have the recipient speedily incorporate the transaction into the blockchain.\n\nThat\'s not [how it worked](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/IP_Transactions). Sending money to an ip address just queried the recipient node for a new pubkey address, then the client would send a tx to that address as normal. Tx fees were always optional for any transaction.\n\n> There\'s specialized mining nodes, there\'s bitcoin-core nodes, there\'s SPV wallets, there\'s the Conformal implementation and nodes based on that, there\'s a JavaScript implementation as well. Only very little of the code behaves the same across implementations (that would be the transaction validation code).\n\nThose are ports of the same code to different programming languages! Of course they behave the same. They all have to implement the exact same protocol in order to be compatible. The only thing different on mining nodes is that they run a very small subroutine (sha256 hashing) on special hardware.\n\n> You must abandon your dogmatism about what is and what isn\'t a P2P network.\n\nI\'m not the one being dogmatic here. There is overlap and interplay between P2P economy and market economy (I\'ll spare you another Bauwens quote on that point). If we\'re talking about network architecture (ie. technical/protocol distinction rather than economic) then I\'d argue it is more clear-cut: bitcoin is a p2p protocol, NOT a client-server protocol.\n\n> Stop arguing with me and start changing your beliefs.\n\nI\'m not arguing with you personally. I\'m just trying to explain (for any reader) why I think the Austrian economic worldview is not the end-all be-all interpretation of socio-economic interaction. P2P theory offers (imho) a more modern perspective (post-scarcity framework for immaterial/digital-information goods) and more explanatory power.': 2, '>Right, its a p2p client (bitcoind is even called the "reference client"). In p2p architecture the participants have very fluid roles, technically all participants are equivalent (that\'s why they\'re called nodes, instead of clients and servers).\n\nNot in all p2p architectures.  Clearly in the case of the Bitcoin network that is not the case -- only a minority perform the server duty of packaging transactions in blocks.\n\n>My point is that it makes little sense to model the participants of a p2p network as consumers and suppliers.\n\nYour point is not valid, because what you reject is in reality exactly how the Bitcoin network *is*.  There is a minority of producers -- they produce security and transaction ability -- and a majority of consumers of those products, who already pay a fee for those products.  In fact, the early code to do direct p2p sends of money to an IP address -- the only thing that would help your point have any truth to it -- was removed in Bitcoin 0.3.\n\nWhat you say "makes little sense" is actually how things *are*, not just a "model". If you are a right-thinking person, then you do not get a choice of thinking about a fact as if the fact was a fantasy -- you are obligated to describe reality as it is, if you want to achieve a correct conclusion. The only way to describe the Bitcoin network *truthfully* is as a network of very different (in code and in duties) clients and servers -- pretending that it is a network of servents, all performing the same roles, is deceitful and false.  ': 3, 'Interesting discussion but a couple things bothering me:  \n\n1) Seems sort of cyclical to use the blockchain(through micropayment channels) to price the blocksize. What if the blocks being released are too large for you to run a full node on?  \n\n2) I really don\'t see the pricing mechanism working out the way he thinks. People are massively incentivized to follow the most recent block. If they aren\'t paying to see the most recent block they will believe they are behind the "truth". This pricing mechanism seems to open up yet another huge can of incentive worms that will be very hard to analyze. At least a hard cap removes all of this.': 3, 'A client that fetches data from the network, and also serves data to other clients.  In p2p terminology it is technically a servent, but mostly acts as a client from a conceptual standpoint because it downloads data, and also because transactions are requests posted to other servents (who act in the role of servers for that transaction).': 2, ">  old and tired arguments from Austrian-econ Libertarian types\n\nTried and true?\n\nDon't fix what isn't broken?": 1, '> So its better to have fewer miners than more miners? And the concern about mining pools colluding with ASIC manufacturers is misplaced fear?\n\nProtip: if you want me to consider what you have to say, it\'s best not to put words in my mouth.\n\n> Let me restate, nobody pays a fee which is earned by nodes for uploading and sharing old blocks.\n\nWhich proves nothing about your beliefs -- there are plenty non-P2P servers and clients who do this exact same upload-download thing and, surprise, they are not P2P. \n\n>     Gifts -- what you are talking about -- are just as much market exchanges as trades are. They are just a special case of a trade -- one where the price is zero.\n> \n> P2P follows the adage: each contributes according to his capacities and willingness, and each takes according to his needs. \n\nThat\'s merely a bunch of revisionist Marxist bollocks attempting to appropriate the positive aspects of certain types of networking to associate them with Marxism.  "See?  This cool technology is like Marxism, therefore Marxism is cool".\n\nBring me facts, not "social sciences" allegations.  Meanwhile, I will continue to believe that gifts are market transactions.\n\n> They key distinction here is to recognize the difference between p2p economy and market economy.\n\nThere is no difference.  (Peaceful) market exchanges are peer to peer.  You are trying to make up a difference where there is none.  Ideological bullshit has no place in a discussion about zeros and ones.  Take it to the back and shoot it in the neck.\n\n>     I do not know why you seek to make a magical exception for / give special treatment to certain trades\n> \n> Because I find that p2p theory (as described by Bauwens)\n\nSo, Marxist blather that has exactly zero validity as a theory.\n\n> has much greater explanatory power than Austrian rationale.\n\nHere is where you play the "well, it\'s either this or that" false dichotomy card.  Of course, your theory has zero explanatory power.  It explains nothing.  All it does, is make a magical exception so that you can continue clinging to the tits of your dogma.\n\n> What\'s the Austrian answer as to why nodes upload the blockchain (even if they don\'t earn a fee for doing so)? What gift do they receive in return?\n\nWrong girl, honey.  Ask an Austrian.  \n\n> funny, I think that\'s what you (and justusranvier) are doing. Twisting clients and servers (even though thats a false dichotomy of p2p architecture)\n\nYou already cornered yourself into admitting that Bitcoin in reality is not a P2P network, or that your definitions of P2P are wrong.  So you don\'t get to continue talking about P2P as if nothing had happened.\n\n> I\'m not arguing\n\nThe hell you aren\'t.  You are very much arguing with me.  Complete with assuming that I am an Austrian and trying to debunk shit I haven\'t said.\n\n---------------------------------------------\n\nThe central point of the difference of opinions here is quite simple:\n\n1. The way you think Bitcoin works, *is not the way it actually works in reality*.\n2. Despite having been informed of the facts, you resist accepting them.\n3. In other words, you are by definition hostile to reality.\n4. It serves no good to discuss anything about this topic with you, nor does whatever you write matter, because the markets you detest *will happen*, and I know this because:\n\n* there\'s already a software design (posted by my friend Justus),\n* this design requires zero changes to the Bitcoin protocol, so there are no barriers to getting the software written,\n* there is a profit motive (incentive) that is waiting to be served,\n* you are 100% powerless to stop this from happening, as no words you utter and no tantrums you throw will stop the software from being written and distributed.\n\nIn other words, you feel free to exhaust yourself by whining all you want, I think I will continue contributing the necessary software to make exactly what you hate happen in reality.  It\'s just a matter of time, lots of unit tests, and posting it on Github.  Here is your takeaway: **Markets happen, one way or another.  You cannot stop them, not by calling it names, not by resisting them, not by pretending that markets are non-markets.**\n\nAnyway, your ideological nonsense is boring, I\'m bored, I\'ll go do laundry instead.': 2, "Hard cap that's adjusted up 25% every 12 months passes Occam's Razor, Justus' solution does not.": 6, 'Justus Ranvier is a moron, and a drama-queen. \n\nHe is one of the most glaring examples of the Dunning\xe2\x80\x93Kruger effect in action.': -9, 'I disagree, I like Justus a lot on a personal level, though I disagree with him on a few issues.': 8, 'The reason its called peer to peer is because there\'s no market hierarchy of "consumers" and "suppliers" (or clients and servers). If relaying tx\'s becomes a market economy (rather than a p2p economy), the "suppliers" (ie. relay nodes) might attempt form some kind of cartel and restrict the supply so they can extort fees from users.\n\nMarkets (or at least buy-sell markets) are not the solution for every problem. There is a wide spectrum of possible mechanisms and incentives. A good place to start reading about them might be [The Political Economy of Peer Production](http://www.informatik.uni-leipzig.de/~graebe/Texte/Bauwens-06.pdf) by Michel Bauwens. Theory around p2p economy is so much more insightful than the old and tired arguments from Austrian-econ Libertarian types. Indeed, the brilliance of the block reward is that it used a incentive-compatible p2p mechanism to enable what the "market principles" of a pompous professor never could.\n\nNow, the issue about incentives to relay transactions was already discussed in the 2012 paper [Bitcoin and Red Balloons](http://arxiv.org/abs/1111.2626). It might be helpful to skim the prior research before rushing out to propose markets as the hammer for every nail in sight.': 9, "OH NO, PLEASE DON'T RES-TAG ME.

If the average time to mine a block during the *D0* difficulty is  less than 10 minutes, then *D1* will adjust upwards (that is, it will be more difficult to mine) so that the average mining time during the *D1* period will be 10 minutes.

So if there are 99,000 other nodes despite that 1% hashing power single node or block of nodes, would a majority of nodes probably have their own limits in place?\n\nLike 2% of nodes might accept anything, but the other 98% would probably have anything from 1mb to 30mb limits. No?\n\nI\'m not an expert on the technical details, but I just don\'t see how the market wouldn\'t correct for such an obviously undesirable thing as 1tb shit blocks from a powerful bad actor--quantity of nodes would overpower "quality" of hashing power in this case.': 1, "Say I own 1% of the hashing power and don't like bitcoin and there is no limit on block size, that means every 1000 minutes on average I could shit a 1tb block into the blockchain of millions of useless transactions I just made. Then the entire bitcoin ecosystem would have to store that 1tb forever and ever till the end of time. (change 1tb to whatever big number you feel is feasible) ": 2, 'The reason there was a limit was to prevent a network attack in the form of "monster blocks". Basically, mining was so easy back then that anyone could generate a block and there was very little stopping them from creating GB+ blocks, which would either push out many miners or generally keep a lot of them busy verifying it. \n\nSo a block limit of 1MB was imposed (huge at the time) and it was always intended to be bumped up higher when needed. The problem is, it\'s part of the consensus rules of the system. Any block larger than 1MB is going to be rejected, so now we\'ve got the problem that we can\'t just willy nilly increase the block size. \n\nAs you say, there isn\'t much reason for miners to create bigger blocks other than keeping the network running good enough that it does not affect the value of bitcoin, since it would obviously affect miners\' income if they only generated blocks with a coinbase transaction in it and nothing else. Those bitcoins would become worthless since they wouldn\'t be able to move / sell them anyway.\n\n\nSo that scalability issue has to be fixed. Gavin\'s invertible bloom filters approach basically makes all block fixed size, regardless of what\'s in them, so mining a big block vs a small block is only limited by verification time and not propagation time. Verification time will be optimized too, once sipa\'s new secp256k1 ECDSA package is adopted into the rest of bitcoin and not only used for signing. Hopefully that will fix most scalability issues for bigger blocks and we can move ahead with Gavin\'s 20MB / double every 2 years block size proposal (or some form of it).': 8, 'Good luck getting that 1TB block propagated in 10 minutes.': 2, "The majority computing power dictates the limits to everyone else.
