The house of cards could only stay up so long and the higher the price went, the more the "fake coins" he had credited his account holders with would cost when they withdrew making his liabilities astronomical. The ridiculous thing is that the hundreds of millions of dollars he was liable for was probably only worth a few million or so originally. \n\nThis is the problem with short selling.

I\'m guessing that he had some other techbical issues that prevented him from accessing the 200k coins that were in his cold wallet which would have possibly kept him afloat much longer, but who knows if/when the bubble would have popped had he been able to. Confidence in Bitcoin would have stayed high and it could easily have gone even higher, making his debt even more expensive. That said, it could have tapered off and he may have been able to eventually gain some ground. It\'s hard to know without looking at the transaction records, but it could have gone either way depending on if he could have kept up with customer withdrawals. Hell, every bank on the planet operates a fractional reserve so it\'s not like it\'s impossible. \n\nRegardless, I think he just seriously made one bad choice after another trying to cover up what he was doing instead of realizing that he needed help.

Applied Cryptography (pp. 157\xe2\x80\x938)\n\n> One of the consequences of the second law of thermodynamics is that a certain amount of energy is necessary to represent information. To record a single bit by changing the state of a system requires an amount of energy no less than kT, where T is the absolute temperature of the system and k is the Boltzman constant. (Stick with me; the physics lesson is almost over.)\n\n> Given that k = 1.38\xc3\x9710^-16 erg/\xc2\xb0Kelvin, and that the ambient temperature of the universe is 3.2\xc2\xb0Kelvin, an ideal computer running at 3.2\xc2\xb0K would consume 4.4\xc3\x9710^-16 ergs every time it set or cleared a bit. To run a computer any colder than the cosmic background radiation would require extra energy to run a heat pump.\n\n> Now, the annual energy output of our sun is about 1.21\xc3\x9710^41 ergs. This is enough to power about 2.7\xc3\x9710^56 single bit changes on our ideal computer; enough state changes to put a 187-bit counter through all its values. If we built a Dyson sphere around the sun and captured all its energy for 32 years, without any loss, we could power a computer to count up to 2^192. Of course, it wouldn't have the energy left over to perform any useful calculations with this counter.\n\n> But that's just one star, and a measly one at that. A typical supernova releases something like 10^51 ergs. (About a hundred times as much energy would be released in the form of neutrinos, but let them go for now.) If all of this energy could be channeled into a single orgy of computation, a 219-bit counter could be cycled through all of its states.\n\n> These numbers have nothing to do with the technology of the devices; they are the maximums that thermodynamics will allow.

The no taint argument reminds me of the folks that claim we don't need to pay income taxes.

If you were to buy bitcoin on Coinbase then your identity would be tied to the bitcoin address that received the coins. If you then went on to deposit those bitcoin at one of the popular bitcoin gambling sites, Coinbase would likely shut down your account. The coins were tainted in so much as they could reasonably be tied to your identity.\n\nRemoving taint in the narrow sense refers to cleaning illegal activity from coins.  This is just dilution. As coins get mixed around from transaction to transaction, all coins will bear some degree of illegal activity. The point is that your freedom may depend on not having that activity associable with your identity. \n\nAn example given in the article at the beginning of this thread is that of someone wanting to donate to Edward Snowden's legal defense. Some see him as a traitor and others as a true patriot. As the Supreme Court has argued that money represents free speech, one could make the argument that supporting his legal defense is a form of free speech. If you were to contribute though, you'd be guilty of a federal crime. In such a scenario it would be important to remove the taint from your donation. Once there is no way to reasonably associate the donation with your identity, you could make it with fear of reprisal from the state.\n\nYour example of concluding that all bitcoin users had played SatoshiDice is actually a perfect example of why coin mixing works. Once tainted bitcoins have been widely mixed it is not possible to confidently associate them with any identity. Remember, circumstantial evidence is quite admissible in a court of law and can be enough for a conviction. Furthermore, when a corporation is making a decision about whether or not to do business with you, just the possibility of unsanctioned activity may be enough for them to permanently sever the relationship.

It was necessary, perhaps, but it wasn\'t testing the system as a whole or anything close to it.\n\nThe "test the limit" perspective also ignores considerations such as: to the extent that there is excess capacity-- like more available CPU cycles within user\'s tolerance-- we have other things that those could be profitably used for-- e.g. making Bitcoin fungible, or making transaction values private, or improvements in system decentralization above the current state or resistance to censorship. To push the transaction throughput level as hard as possible can only come at the expense of all the other ways the system could be (and needs to be) improved. This is especially important because there are much better ways to achieve high scale known to us now, and any small change that could be stretched to like to 2mb or 8mb isn\'t enough to categorically change the kinds of applications that Bitcoin can be used for.\n\nThe things I am talking about absolutely are technical factors as they change with technology.  That they also can be scaled by other factor (e.g. our willingness to drop the whole system onto a single upsized server) is true, but doesn\'t diminish the fact that the rest depends on the other system.  I\'m sorry that I don\'t have time to explain every technical nuance and engineering trade-off in the system to you one on one.\n\nThe fact that there is a considerable trade-off between scale and decenteraliztion was well understood by the system\'s creator; and notion you\'re expressing about "can light up dark fiber" presumes a completely centralized system-- as the most efficient way to organize the system is to not replicate it all over the place--; which is a possible outcome but not a very interesting one.': 1, ">While Pieter's proposed 17.7% growth rate is reasonable, it seems pretty clear that 1 MB is not actually the current technological limit for block sizes.  \n\nLatencies for propagation and validation appear to be high enough to warrant caution.

You all continue to claim that you\'re arguing about "technical limits," when in reality you\'re arguing about political risks, about economic decisions, etc.\n\nGavin did an admirable job of laying out the **technical limits** months ago, complete with testing and a reasonable theory and an assertion of just what level of node decentralization Bitcoin should aim to achieve.  But, in the end, and according to Satoshi\'s original design, Bitcoin isn\'t really "technically" limited by anything other than the rate at which participants can light up dark fiber.  And the economic decisions of miners who think they can skip verifying transactions doesn\'t really come into play, at all.\n\nBeyond that, I\'m fine with arguing about political risks and economic decisions.  But, as I\'ve said before, none of the "active Bitcoin developers" are experts on either of those.  So you all have a choice to make, here, as far as I\'m concerned.  If you want to continue making this claim that there is some kind of "technical" limit pertinent to the blocksize debate, please lay out exactly what "technical" limitations you\'re referring to.  The burden of proof isn\'t on me.  You\'re the one who has made that claim.  It seems to have no theory behind it whatsoever, just some empirical observations that node count has dropped a little bit, that a few irrational miners have attempted to fork off their own completely unworkable chain by not verifying transactions, and some claims about memory usage and UTXO caching that we\'ve discussed before and that I\'ve still never seen sufficiently explained.  Is that it?\n\nIf, on the other hand, you\'d like to move on to arguing about (what I think is the real issue) political risks and economic consequences, then remove those idiotic little stacks of books from your flair, stop pretending that the opinion of developers carries any more weight on the issue of ideal block size than anyone elses, and please try to do at least as good a job of laying out the case for limiting block sizes as Gavin has done for increasing it.': 2, '>  it seems pretty clear that 1 MB is not actually the current technological limit for block sizes\n\nOn what basis do you make that claim?  (I don\'t *think* its "the limit"(*), but to say its "pretty clear" is a pretty big leap from the information I have available to me: I think it is clearly not clear where the limits are right now.)\n\nOur actual average block sizes are half that 1MB right now (and the average over the last two years even smaller) and yet our node deployment has fallen tremendously since the sizes have gotten above 500k. Even many commercial operations use hosted API providers rather than running their own nodes. We just observed a network fault a few weeks back where the state diverged and resulted in a huge reorg because around half the hashrate was mining without validating at all.\n\nIt\'s quite difficult to discern out the exact limits for scale in a decentralized network because it\'s not sufficient to say that a single server by itself running full bore can just barely keep up (which is fairly easy to measure) because the real limits are tolerances on the share of usage on a system, ability to survive DOS attacks, etc. Participants have lower cost options (e.g. not validating), so the cost likely needs to be below their indifference threshold. Communicating about the risks of not verifying can be at odds with encouraging people to use the system.\n\nIn any case, if we look at the actual network at current sizes, the signs are not great. So I think the evidence there is conflicted at best, and there isn\'t any obviously safe coarse of action, which is part of why care is required.\n\n(*) Actually, I think 1MB was likely beyond the limit until recently; but really substantial improvements have been made, which we haven\'t yet completely seen the fruit of yet; and with them I believe that we\'re in a much better position.

Do you have any data points or technical reasons to share that would indicate otherwise?\n\n>there are much better ways to achieve high scale known to us now\n\nThat would be Lightning network, and what else?\n\nI\'m sure many would dispute the claim that Lightning is "much better".

It just presumes the ability to bypass ISPs with restrictive data caps (the major obstacle to scaling) and centralized datacenters -- potentially even a *less* centralized solution.  **That\'s the ultimate technical limit.**  It has nothing to do with centralization or decentralization, *which are political rather than technical concerns*.\n\nBeyond that even, you keep repeating this claim that node decentralization is the sine qua non of Bitcoin decentralization, but it\'s not true either.  In fact, it isn\'t even the most important *component* of decentralization.  Bitcoin\'s **primary** mechanism of decentralization is *economic*, and has almost nothing to do with miners or nodes or any of that.\n\n>The fact that there is a considerable trade-off between scale and decenteraliztion was well understood by the system\'s creator\n\nWell, I\'m not sure I would say it\'s a "considerable" trade-off, seeing as how tens of thousands of users still have the opportunity to run nodes right now and instead choose to use things like SPV wallets instead.  But it should have been understood by everyone who uses Bitcoin, not just Satoshi, that some amount of node centralization would occur at some point, just as some amount of mining centralization has already occurred.  Even mining centralization wasn\'t nearly this controversial.\n\n> I\'m sorry that I don\'t have time to explain every technical nuance and engineering trade-off in the system to you one on one.\n\nDon\'t do it for me.  There are hundreds of Bitcoin users here who ask the same questions, every day.

Unless I\'m mistaken this was not a problem with hard currencies like gold themselves.  It only happens as a result of the unfortunate link between government and currency being created.  Governments need to print more money because governments spend recklessly.  Bitcoin by definition was created to sever that link and create a stable and predictable system free of trendy manipulation.  TBI\'s piece essentially amounts to sacrilege yet he\'s wondering why he\'s gotten such negative feedback.\n\nRegarding some of the other issues in TBI\'s piece:\n\n1. The irony regarding his concern about the BTC wealthy is that unlike fiat systems, that wealth is much harder to use to change very important things about the system like the money supply/inflation rate which he is proposing to change!  Similar to my opening point, that risk is caused not by wealth but by exertion of that wealth on governments controlling the money supply.\n\n2. Assuming block rewards won\'t be enough incentive to keep the network safe is just that, an assumption and likely a bad one.  It would mean that the price of bitcoin will not have significantly risen.  If it hasn\'t then the mining requirements for the security of the network is smaller as well.  We likely have a huge buffer at this point and could afford to lose significant mining power if all else stayed the same.  That said, I don\'t think this community, with the amount of interest in it is expecting to remain static.\n\n3. Creating inflation is not a solution to the halvings.  It\'s just moving the cost from fees that affect spenders to devaluation that affects everyone.  I can\'t pretend to predict the overall impact, but I don\'t think this this will help.  Inflation in this system (unlike in fiat systems) is well known and factored into the price already.  We are seeing price stability despite inflation.  We will know more next year at the halving.  My gut is that the adoption and price will be up by then which means an increase in mining fees and a higher than half block reward when translated into local currency.  In case that sounds complicated, for example (using USD for ease) if BTC is at $400 next year, the block reward will have not decreased in USD by 50% but by only ~30%.  If BTC\'s at $500 the decrease will be only ~11%.\n\n4. If weak mining power somehow did threaten the system, people with a vested interest in the system, namely frequent users, wealthy hoarders and bitcoin companies, would have a vested interest in running miners and/or investing in them, just like with nodes.\n\n5. TBI\'s models also assume the cost of mining will not be spread out and efficiency increased, the likes of what 21 seems to be working on.\n\nThere are many more points to make but these are the main ones I see. \n\nRegarding this: "Consider that at a 2% inflation subsidy, the ownership by long-term holders only gets diluted by half every ~35 years."\n\nNo thanks.

Well probably, when you frame it that way, but it doesn't really add anything to the conversation.": 2, '[deleted]': 1, '> I\'m not sure if I agree with Ryan\'s solution, but I do agree with the problem he describes, at least to a large extent.\n\nI can see why people may think it is unfair, but what about when gold first made its appearance / conversion from commodity to money? Whenever that happened, it happened, and that was that. And what about gold\'s 10x rise in value from $200 to $2,000? Did gold\'s value to investors suddenly decrease because gold had increased in value, or because gold\'s supply basically does not increase each year (lack of inflation)? Bitcoin seems to be extremely similar to gold, yet nobody complains that gold supply is not increasing. Instead of complaining, people have been buying. Over time, because of its lack of inflation, gold as an asset has attracted 7+ trillion USD as an "inflation hedge" class of asset.\n\nIf bitcoin represents a better gold (digital gold, gold 2.0) due to algorithmically determined 0% inflation in max supply, in addition to all the other various superior attributes, then it would appear bitcoin is destined for a similar fate to that of gold (as an "inflation hedge 2.0").\n\nFurthermore, as we know, bitcoin does not even have 0% inflation yet. It is inflating on a pre-determined schedule, which means newcomers have had (and still do have) plenty of chance to enter while bitcoin is artificially made relatively cheap (due to the increasing supply):\n> http://i.imgur.com/SMsh2zk.png\n\nFinally, no one is forcing anyone to buy bitcoin. Thus, it can\'t be described as "unfair" (I know you didn\'t explicitly use the word, but it was implied by your post; Ryan Selkis also has implied it). As mentioned, like gold, bitcoin is basically an \'inflation hedge\'. People buy into it pre-emptively (to pre-empt fiat inflation), or reactively during times of chaos by compulsion. It is optional; people do so by choice. Obviously if society was being forced into bitcoin from fiat by decree, then it wouldn\'t be fair for people to convert their fiat at an increasingly inflated rate... but that\'s not the case.\n\n> Therefore, what I will say about Bitcoin\'s wealth distribution, is that it is extreme. And therefore, I predict that most people will consider it undesirable as a global currency/digital gold-standard/something like that.\n\nThe interesting thing is I haven\'t really heard this criticism leveled at bitcoin. Can you name anyone of import? Virtually all entities (individuals, VC funds, hedge funds, investment groups, businesses, developers, etc.) recognize that bitcoin is \'digital gold\' and thus that the fixed cap is a feature and asset. Besides Selkis, I can\'t really think of any significant entity with the audacity to genuinely suggest removing the cap. I think Jon Matonis has mentioned it a few times, but only as a point of discussion on how to address future miner rewards, but never as it being unfair because of inequality.\n\nThere may be debates and disagreement in the bitcoin community on how / when to raise block size cap, but I\'d venture there is sheer unanimity (I\'m defining it as > 99%) in terms of the 21m cap being sacrosanct and untouchable.': 1, 'All of that marginal cost can be eliminated by centralizing mining; which is one of the reasons that additional scale creates increased pressure for centralization.\n\nAdditionally, any cost in the system paying for those marginal costs cannot be used to pay for security.

Maybe after the 2020 halving, for example.\n\nI'm open to any ideas that would address those sorts of issues when they are issues.\n\nI have almost no doubt that an alternate solution is possible. One that doesn't open pandora's box.\n\n> You would be faced with a choice. Stick to your fixed supply guns or agree to a little money expansion. Which do you choose?\n\nI'll do what works. Clearly I'm not against expansion of the supply of money as I'm in bitcoin right now.": 1, "Exactly.  There's a reason Freicoin or something similar will never beat Bitcoin.

Call it something else and go to a different subreddit.': 26, "I can't think of a more fair distribution than making the inventors and early adopters stupid rich. I also expect the person who cures cancer to die on a gold plated toilet.\n\nPeople who produce value should be the people who receive it.": 2, 'The miners *do* care if those nodes belong to well-connected hubs and wallet providers.  The block relay network only benefits the miners.  Nodes still have to download whatever blocks are mined and do not receive any block rewards for it.  They have plenty of incentive to place size limits on what propagates.\n\nExample: Mining Pool A creates a very large block and attempts to transmit it.  Being on the block relay network, all the other mining pools instantly see that it will be refused by all the major nodes, making their attempt to orphan that block a profitable venture.  Soon after, Mining Pool B solves a competing block and makes it a size acceptable to all major nodes.  The B block out-propagates the A block, therefore successfully orphaning it.': 1, 'It\'s kind of baffling that someone like him is "Director of Investments" at http://DCG.co.': 6, '>The blocksize agenda and its argument that fees need to remain ~0 coupled with calls for "governance" sound a lot like coded language for readying the system for inflation.\n\nThe blocksize agenda is nothing of the sort. It\'s about enabling Bitcoin to fulfill its original promise, and more importantly, make a global impact. Large blockists by and large believe that Bitcoin should not be changed, and consider a small block future a change.': 2, 'If you think convincing people to change the maximum block size is difficult...': 5, 'Repeat after me...divisible to the 8th decimal place...well done.': 5, "The moment say 60% of miners accept to have the block reward go from say 12.5 (assuming this hypothetical decision was made in a few years) to say 50 coins per block, those 4x as many coins are each going to be worth 1/100th times as much, as everyone who stepped into bitcoin for its decentralised, software-based, 21m cap, steps out.\n\nI mean really the moment you get a ton of inflation going is the moment bitcoin stops being scarce, and stops being better than altcoins. And when the value drops, mining drops with it, and with that, security is gone, and with that any blockchain application becomes insecure and ceases to exist. \n\nIs wealth concentration a problem? I'm not sure. I mean obviously the answer is yes to some extent, but what is the alternative? Fiat currencies have wealth concentration issues, too. That's not a function of the currency, the currency just expresses inequalities. If you create inflation, it doesn't solve the fact that those with capital tend to have a higher return than those who rely purely on their labor, which is the reason wealth concentration, denominated in whichever currency you want, has gotten worse over time. \n\nBut when we look at bitcoin I'm seeing concentration that's much lower than it used to be. TBI makes the point that bitcoin is being held in centralised funds, that may well be true but that's not ownership, that's simply storage. If I keep my car in your garage, you don't own my gar, it's simply stored there. So looking at companies like Coinbase and saying 'ooh wealth concentration' misses the point, because it's concentration of storage, not ownership. And it obviously misses the point insomuch that inflation does NOTHING to change that. You may be against centralised storage, too, but it has absolutely nothing to do with the notion of inflation. Yet TBI actually referred to these parties, like ones that store coins on behalf of shareholders. That's totally unrelated to inflation, why mention it?\n\nBeyond that, bitcoin is still early days. I think we have to look at it like an IPO. Pre-IPO you have maybe a few tens of shareholders, post IPO you can have millions of individual owners. Once enough people are willing to purchase bitcoin, the concentration dilutes. After all, bitcoins can be openly traded by anyone, worldwide. The only limitation is the willingness of owners to sell, but again IPOs show that this willingness is very significant, and who are you to force someone to sell an asset, or to simply print some more and devalue his?\n\nBeyond that, look at assets like gold and the absolutely ridiculous amount of wealth concentration there by countries and governments. \n\nLastly it feels like a self-solving issue. If bitcoin fails because of wealth concentration, guess what people with concentrations of wealth will do before it completely fails? Sell it off. Guess what that does to the problem? Solve it. It's a similar incentive to 51% attacks: if the people with the power to solve it do not solve it, they lose, if they solve it, they win. This is one of those things I think in the long run can work itself out largely. ": 1, 'My node says no.
