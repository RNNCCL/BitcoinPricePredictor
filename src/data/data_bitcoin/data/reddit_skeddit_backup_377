What the Irish company is doing with Greece may end up being huge.\n\nDon't worry if you can't buy coffee with Bitcoin; I don't think in the near-term future that is what it is particularly useful for.": 2, "It's not either-or. You can save a certain amount and also use a certain amount for daily spending. I know that some people just save and don't spend, and that's fine also because it's their BTC so they get to decide what to do with it. It's nobody elses business really. It hurts adoption as a currency but helps adoption as a commodity.\n\nSo whether you spend or save or both... you're helping Bitcoin adoption as a currency or as a commodity or both. Either way Bitcoin wins.": 3}, ('The blocksize cap is basically worthless for keeping the Bitcoin network safe from attacks', 22): {'> In what way are they different?\n\nFor one thing, a big block attack can be effectively prevented by imposing a **small** block size cap, like 1 MB.

But what does a big block attack do to bandwidth use that a big unconfirmed transaction attack doesn't?\n\nIf a bad miner creates a huge block, some **clients** will be unable to download it -- for bandwidth, memory, or some other restriction -- and therefore will be unable to check whether they transaction was processed, etc..  And this problem will be permanent, since the block will be part of the blockchain.  A spam attack does not affect clients, except by delaying their low-fee transactions while the attack is underway.\n\nThe two attacks are **totally** different things. \n": 2, "The fact that bitcoin is surviving this attack should be a reason to BUY.

On the contrary, spam attacks are effective only because there is a maximum blocksize (hard coded or imposed by bandwidth); and, to reduce the risk of such attacks, one must increase the blocksize as much as other constraints allow.  \n\nI suppose that we mostly agree that 1 MB is way too small. Except that I don't see how to do without a hard maximum block size limit, for practical programming reasons and for protection against big-block attacks.\n": 2, '> Sure. And he probably did.

It does not prevent a high network load due to large number of unconfirmed transactions.\n\nRather:  *Some* hard block size limit is necessary for practical programming reasons and to protect against big block attacks. Period.  The question is only what it should be.  A smaller limit makes spam attacks cheaper.  Therefore the size limit should be just small enough to prevent big block attacks, and any other severe problems that may be caused by big blocks; but not smaller.  \n\n1 MB is way too small, as we have seen.  8MB is of course better, and still seems small enough to prevent big block attacks.  The Chinese miners say that 20 MB would cause problems for them.  But, even with 8 or 20 MB blocks, spam attacks are still only 20 x more expensive than now.  Even with 8 or 20 MB blocks, it would be prudent to raise the minimum fee to some significative value, say 0.05 USD.

There is always an odd full node misbehaving, dropping off the network, having a suddenly noisy DSL line, etc.\nSo there will always be nodes like that even with the current 1MB block size. This happens, all the time.\n\nAn uncapped blocksize would mean that it *could* happen to *more* nodes. But then you also have to look at incentives: If 51% of miners are rational, they have no interest of this happening. They want validated transactions to arrive at the edges, and they want unconfirmed transactions to gossip through to them. And we have to rely on 51% of the miners being interested in a healthy Bitcoin anyways...\n\nAlso note that the odd megablock does not cause a permanent disruption, and a temporary disruption will clue all interested parties in on how to proceed from thereon.\n\nThe most extreme example, a >51% miner hashing a petabyte block, would also be meaningless to the rest of the network. It would just sit somewhere and do nothing.\n\nIf you wanted to send it around, you'd currently need a high-bandwidth truck full of HDDs. [Funny how analogies to gold transfers come up here :)]\n\nIn other words, the orphan cost would be astronomical.\n\nBitcoin not only relies on the longest valid proof of work, it relies on the longest valid proof of work that can be transmitted through the internet, and the always existing incentive of avoiding orphan cost makes it work well, while potentially approaching the limits of technology - if it would not have a hard blocksize limit.\n\nIn other words: Accepting the idea of an orphan cost existing  also means that *inherently* there is indeed a strong incentive for a miner to get his block to all interested parties.": 2, "> For one thing, a big block attack can be effectively prevented by imposing a small block size cap, like 1 MB.

But what does a big block attack do to bandwidth use that a big unconfirmed transaction attack doesn't?\n\nExactly! Nothing!\n\nThe big block attack is actually benign in some ways compared to the unconfirmed transaction attack: No memory pools filling up, no chance for the attacker to recycle their coins for another attack, *less load on the full nodes in the network*. Exactly what the blocklimiters intend....\n": 1, "> Without a hard cap known to everyone, there is always a magic block size that would get accepted by enough miners and nodes, but would choke some players.\n\nBut so would this very attack choke some players. The blocksize didn't prevent that at all. Yet the network survived!\n\nI think the point is that the network is never in a state of *perfection*. There will always be some nodes having problems.\nHowever, dynamic consensus on the vast majority of nodes exists.\n\nBecause the network blocksize limit is wholly ineffective against attacks and spamming in terms of bandwidth, we have been actually running with the training wheels off *all along*, but didn't realize it!\n\nAnd it works just *fine*.\n\n\n> Besides, the system cannot rely on nodes or miners suppressing bad blocks.

The other half of the network load is free to be driven to insanity by attackers! (Or rather, as apparently some average of the P2P network allows)\n\n\nAn *attacker* doesn't care at all whether transactions confirm (actually, it is even better if they don't as he can keep his money), and so he can spam the network as much as he likes, regardless of actual blocksize!\n\nAll the blocksize does is keeping the double load away from transactions being sent around again in the mined blocks. That is the factor of at most an asymptotic 2x in cost increase for a zero-sized blockcap that I was talking about.\n": 4, '> The purpose of having a hard cap on the block size should be obvious to any competent software developer. That is why the original implementation of bitcoin had a block size limit (32 MB).\n\nAgreed, but 32MB is not an intended *political hard cap forever* but just a current technical limit of the network code. We should keep that in place before the code has been fixed, of course.\n\n> The reason why that limit was lowered to 1 MB by Satoshi was to ward off one specific type of attack, when a miner creates (by malice or accident) a block that is large enough to break something in the system. \n\nIf the block is very large, it won\'t get to any full node, will be orphaned. The miner loses money. Incentives. That\'s why I think it was aptly described as a temporary anti-spam measure. Because early on, GB sized blocks for no reason (whereas they have very legit reasons now) seemed cumbersome.\n\n> At that time, Satoshi wrote that the limit could be increased later, when needed, by doing a hard fork. I don\'t know what was that something that could break; may have been related to internet bandwidth. \n\nAnd as I have pointed out, internet bandwidth is *only constrained to 0.5x what it would be without any cap in the asymptotic limit of a zero cap.*\n\n> But definitely the 1 MB limit was NOT meant to limit the number of transactions per day, or to create a "fee market".\n\nFully agreed.\n\n\n> This stress test showed that the minimum fee is still too low for the 1 MB limit, so that spam attacks are still rather cheap (5000 euros was said to be the budget of the current one). Either the minimum fee should be raised substantially, or the 1MB cap should be increased substantially, or both. \n\nFlip the argument the other way around. The 1MB limit is too low to actually support all transactions happening in the network. The network is stressed *either way*. It is at most stressed twice as much by removing the cap (because then all the transactions would be confirmed). \n\n\nHowever, the transactions being confirmed would also mean that the spammer would actually *pay* for them!\n\n\n> Spam attacks cannot be completely prevented, however. No matter how big the cap and how high the fee, an attacker with a large enough budget can always do it. So let\'s just say that we want to make a spam attack 100 times more expensive than it is now.\n\nAnd again,  the blocksize cap only makes them twice as expensive! ***It does not, at all, remove the capability to spam the network!***\n\nForget about the blocksize cap as an effective cap on the spam in the network.\n\nThat is just for honest transactions, actually meant to be included in blocks!\n ': 8, 'The purpose of having a hard cap on the block size should be obvious to any competent software developer.

As a weak protection againts this "spam attack", the number of free transactions in a block was eventually limited, and a minimum fee was required for the rest, intended to make such spam attacks expensive. \n\nThis stress test showed that the minimum fee is still too low for the 1 MB limit, so that spam attacks are still rather cheap (5000 euros was said to be the budget of the current one).

But that would bring its own problems, including the risk of a "big block" attack.  \n\nSo the minimum fee must be raised substantially.  Right now the minimum fee for an average transaction seems to be about 0.01 USD.  Requiring a minimum fee 100 times larger, 1.00 USD, would severely impact the use of bitcoin. \n\nIn conclusion, both the minimum fee and the block size cap must be increased.  Say, a minimum fee of ~0.10 USD and a max block size of 8 MB.  That would put the minimu cost of filling 100% of the network\'s capacity for 1 day to about 300\'000 USD.

However, I can see if /u/ryancarnated had extended the idea in the meantime.\n\nMy implementation concept was to retrofit the existing open-source distributions of the reddit codebase so that:\n\n1) People wishing to bring up an instance of reddit could do so easily.  The currently default settings of the reddit codebase make it pretty hard to get it running, mostly because it\'s optimized for reddit\'s at-scale setup.  We\'d package it up with some nice default settings and how-to guides so that little Aiden could install it on his dorm computer.  Call each of these separate installations of reddit an "instance."\n\n2) Create an open "inter-reddit protocol" similar to how [USENET](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1036) works, where each installation of reddit could publish the subreddits it was hosting (posts, comments, votes) to other instances of reddit.\n\nThen, the administrators of each reddit instance could decide to "subscribe" to any set or subset of subreddits hosted on other installations of reddit.  These subreddits would then be imported into that instance for the readership of that subreddit to subscribe to. \n\nThe idea is that if you had your account on reddit on "reddit prime" or "reddit voat" or "reddit lots-of-questionable-porn" you could create a frontpage consisting of subreddits from that home instance of reddit, mixing in subreddits from any of the instances that the admins of that instance had decided to import from.\n\nDue to the asynchronous nature of posting, commenting, and even voting (a lag in counting votes is ok), all of these operations could just be re-transmitted back to the original hosting instance, computed, and rebroadcast out to all subscribing reddits - you could dynamically batch them depending on load and ambient throughput conditions.\n\nAdvantages would include making it so that every reddit instance need only conform to the inter-reddit protocol; they could experiment with different sets of features (or even ranking algorithms - since they are computed on the fly from raw vote totals, the only things which are transmitted) without requiring that the entire universe of reddits adopt them.\n\nWhile it would not be *utterly* decentralized, I believe that allowing for multiple "domains" of hosted reddit instances would be sufficiently federated to make it impossible to ever completely destroy reddit - let\'s call this Reddit with a capital-R.  Subreddits who found themselves unwelcome on one host could migrate to another one (or be exiled to another one, if they were bringing down powerful forces that its host could not resist), while still making themselves available to whichever other installations wanted to import them.  You could host reddit instances that were political sensitive/dangerous in Iceland or whereever they needed to be to be safe from those whom they were pissing off.  It would also allow the broader universe of many-reddits to collectively vote on which subreddits to shun, by not importing them, yet not outright banning them.  In essence, this would turn reddit into a new kind of open internet protocol, instead of being one company.\n\nThis would solve two key problems at once: make Reddit and its community immune to censorship by powerful forces, and allow individual reddits to decline to host subreddits they found objectionable without having ban them, i.e. exile instead of execution.\n\nI actually discussed this a bit with /u/alienth and /u/spladug, but it was only in the context of long-term plans.

Bitcoin will develop randomly, like the internet. Try to plan It and you will have people trying to control It (power struggle) and It's not going to work.\n\nHow would a convention be any more centralized than the small group of computer scientists currently controlling Bitcoin development? Explain to me why you think Bitcoin isn't being planned as a function of the development work that has been done on it since Day 1. I get that the network accepts or denies changes on its own, but ultimately its them telling us what's going on, why we should update, etc. For small changes, this is ok, as the alternative would just not be feasible for something that has become this big. But large scale changes like the subjects of current discussion? Not so much. We need careful deliberation and decision making, with the same breadth of input as the many academic disciplines that converged to form Bitcoin.\n\nIf we start taking random shots and hoping they hit, it's much more likely we'll miss. Steady aim, organization is key. We know it's key. We know it's key insofar as we're comfortable with dev mailing lists, GitHub, etc., and the current organization of core devs more or less steering the helm. I'm saying extend the discussion a bit further out to experts in key fields to make sure all bases are covered, *in such a way that allows the discussion to all be in one place, all laid out, with the mandate of some sort of consensus reached by the end.*\n\nWhat's the timetable about when a decision needs to be reached about the issues the ecosystem currently faces over the protocol? We know we need to reach one but how long do we have? Nobody knows. Who's an acceptable authority on the block size matters? Certainly not only the core devs. Then who else? The miners want a say. None of this is defined. No organization. What exactly are the issues? There are many different proposals being discussed on many different forums, mailing lists, and IRCs.  Which are the most popular? *We can't even gauge that.* And until any of this is defined or organized, these matters will persist in the way they are now -- impasses, a standstill, a traffic jam, frustration, ignorance.   \n\nHow long can randomness persist? It would be selfish to deny the developing world, for example, what may be there the best ticket yet to financial inclusion. For what? Random, organic change, if any? And this is assuming that good change is predicated necessarily on randomness. It isn't. You see something in the distance, you don't blindfold yourself, spin around on a stick 15 times, and dizzily hope you get there. You walk towards it. Take step towards it.\n\nPeople are planning and controlling no matter what. If that wasn't the case, we'd still be on the first version post-Satoshi and there would be no core devs. I'm proposing to decentralize this control as much as possible without being subjected to the whims of those who do not have the expertise or exposing the network to shills so that consensus can finally be reached, *which then goes on to the final consensus of the entire network having a say by choosing to update or not*.

Imagine that the interblock time is 1 minute, so blocks just a few hundred milliseconds apart are common.  There will be a lot of orphaning in this topology because often blocks will be found before the prior block could be communicated.\n\nOrphans will happen to everyone, but the orphaning situation will be _profitable_ for Alice and Bob!  This is because when either Alice or Bob races with Charlie they will usually win because the 70% of the hashpower heard their block first, and 70% produces another block faster on average than 30%.   So, e.g. Charlie's orphan rate might be 15% while Alice and Bob have a 7% orphan rate each; and the network difficulty will be 9.4% lower than it would be with no orphaning, so Alice and Bob will each make 2.4% more income than they should have.  (figures are somewhat random though there is some interblock time and latency figure which would make these numbers correct).\n\nAnother example to imagine, -- thing of someone with 60% hashrate on a dialup modem.
