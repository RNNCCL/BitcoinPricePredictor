Bitcoin can't handle any significant growth at the moment \n\nSo there are real cost associated with not upgrading the limit. I don't think anyone would disagree.\n\nNow is there a cost to upgrading the block size limit? I think that's a resounding NO. Because the limit in no way forces blocks sizes to go upward (it only artificially forces them to be smaller). \n\nThere is a cost to having bigger blocks, but there are enough mechanisms for Miners to keep blocks smaller (soft limits/orphan limits etc). No small miner could force a majority to mine on top of huge blocks, and a majority of miners need to be cost effective, are conservative and risk averse. The accidental selfish miner theory is simply not realistic.  \n\nThe upside of the block size limit might be that we are forced to fix some scalability issues, although actually running into scalability issues would have probably done the same (with a lot less drama). Thin blocks/IBLT/Weak blocks start to make real sense when the block size increases. \n\nBlocks can probably grow comfortably towards 4Mb. Certainly if by the time an increase is activated IBLT/Weak blocks are also in production. \n\nUltimately it should be the market which decides what it is and isn't comfortable with running (cost based). If the block size is increased now you would probably see almost no difference whatsoever except that transactions fees become less erratic. You could have the exact same average block size and still come out on top (also same orphan risks, bandwidth, storage). \n\nAlthough we will never see how terribly unexciting an increase would be because it will simply take too much time for it to get activated. By that time the pressure to create bigger blocks (because it reduces cost and adds profits) would be too big to resist for miners. Which would only proof that the cost of having the limit was higher than the cost of bigger blocks.
