I will also remove the variable capacity and stability of the (consumer-grade?) hardware at each hop.  In other words, the mesh net is a perfect mesh net where it provides service. \n\nAt some point, the packets have to exit the mesh net and enter a local exchange/provider which can route to/from the internet proper.  This may be a consumers wired connection, which suffers from existing lack of competition or some local hub where tier 2/3 providers have set up an exchange.\n\nFor the sake of the rest of my argument, I will assume you do _NOT_ live in a city that is already a major data hub.  \n\nThe tier 2/3 provider market is also non-competitive as the costs of backbone infrastructure is still pretty high particularly in rural and geographically isolated markets.  So, if you are lucky enough to have a local exchange it is likely only competitively populated by the entities that can offset the cost of providing service to the exchange with the profit of direct last-mile customers, everyone else would be effectively paying an additional premium to provide service to the local exchange and be at an economic disadvantage.\n\nThis means that all roads still lead back to a local data gatekeeper.  If one of their avenues for profit starts dwindling because, for instance, a mesh net has cut into their last-mile customer base, then the price of other services would have to go up to keep their business in the black.  Since they still have all the control points, that cost increase will eventually propagate down to the end users of the mesh net either though increased last-mile service cost to their best mesh-hop -or- increased service cost in the local exchange.  If you add in overhead for maintaining/managing the local exchange and/or mesh net, it seems likely that equivalent services from the mesh-net would be more expensive than the incumbent monopoly, unless the mesh-net itself has a lower cost to maintain than existing in ground infrastructure.\n\nA mesh net means more middle-men and more overhead and ultimately more cost unless you can completely replace your current last-mile provider with a mesh net.

There's  chance that it might not be worth their time to even change the default block size limit. This would change with >16 MB blocks.\n\n2.

If it is a dust limit issue, be sure to inspect all outputs to make sure they\'re 5400 satoshis or more.

I think this a gross overestimation for the demand for censorship resistant transactions. \n\nHow many people actually want 1-10 censorship-resistant transactions **per day**? I'd argue there are none now, and there will never be anywhere close to a billion. \n\nThere's lots of reasons to use bitcoin besides censorship resistance, but you can get them with off-chain transactions too, for a tiny fraction of the cost (edit: of the theoretical $1 per day):\n\n* The bitcoin unit of account\n* Privacy\n* Cheap transactions\n* Fast transactions\n\nAnd you'll still have a certain amount of censorship resistance, just not the maximum.

THAT is actually the real reason why *I'm* in Bitcoin. Look: we all know that the world's assets have been bought with their fiat funny money. As their grip on the monetary system decentralizes, you think they're not going to brand Bitcoiners as terrorists?? We're gearing up for the fight of our lives, here. We have to get the foundations right so that these currencies can flow while minimizing the possibility that they'll be hacked, tracked, or stopped.\n\nYou watch.

The rate of increase in the cost of mining will decline from the "get it secure" rate it\'s growing at now to a "keep it secure" level.\n\nThere will be a substantial contraction in the cost/transaction as the previously under-utilized transaction capacity becomes utilized. This will be the second golden age for Bitcoin miners: their capital outlays will diminish from growth levels to maintenance levels, and their incomes will rise with increased transaction fees. I suspect that only a portion of these cost reductions will be passed onto users, and that transactions fees will rise as a percentage of miner cost.\n\nAdditionally, the network *will* begin pruning.

I guess I'll start at the top...\n\nTrezor - Hardware wallet, good for everything. Stores keys in hardware so it can be used safely on a compromised machine. Compatible with many wallets including MyTrezor.com, GreenAddress.it, Electrum, MultiBit, and recently CoinPrisim, with support for more wallets presumably on the way.   \n\nElectrum - Software wallet. This is the software I usually use for bitcoin transactions. It's an SPV wallet, meaning it does not require the full blockchain in local storage; it uses trusted servers to gather that information. As a result, there are some concerns with maintaining privacy. This is probably a good wallet if you're not doing thing illegal or that you might want to hide.\n\nArmory - In contrast with Electrum's thin-client design, Armory is a software wallet that *does* require the full blockchain. Armory is well known for its cold storage features and offline signing ability, and it's overall secure design.\n\nPaper wallets - can be created using a variety of different services/softwares/code. Basically, it's just a printout of the public/private keypair for a single bitcoin address. You can give people the public key, and they can send you funds. Don't loose the private key. Many consider paper wallets to be the most secure form of bitcoin storage, but they are only really secure provided they are created in a secure manner using trusted code for key generation and probably on an offline machine.\n\nTails - is a linux distro designed for security. It's a liveOS with Tor already configured. All you need to do is install the OS to a USB or CD and boot the machine. It's pretty user friendly, and features an optional persistent storage volume. Recently seen in use by Ed Snowden in the Citizenfour documentary\n\nWhonix - another security/privacy-focused linux distro, but this one is a little bit more complex to understand. I've only recently started learning about whonix, but the idea is to use a pair of virtual machines, known respectively as a gateway and a workstation. This architecture prevents even malware running as root from discovering your actual clearnet IP. You'll need virtual box for this\n\nTor - tor is a software that allows anonymous connection to the internet by basically bouncing your connection to different servers around the world. There are some security concerns regarding man in the middle attacks (basically attacker impersonating reputable web pages) Tor is the software used to provide anonymity in both of the above-mentioned operating systems.\n\nAlso, check out /r/BitcoinBeginners for questions like these, you'll probably get more responses.\n": 6, 'It moved.': 1, 'I believe custom firmware can be loaded but the device would notify you that it was not signed by trezor devs': 1, "As an aside to add to other's contributions: Tails and trisquel include Electrum by default in their distros, so they can be fairly easy for offline LiveCD storage.

Or one of the compatible web-wallets of your liking.\n\nI would be confident that the funds stored on Trezor are secure, so I wouldn't have a problem storing most or all of my funds there. However, depending on other investments or valuables you might already have, a paper wallet may fit within your existing security model. For instance, if you already use a safe deposit box to store some gold and stock certificates, then the use of a paper wallet to store some additional funds would be a rather intuitive way to do it. This would be good for your $10k+ storage. Be sure to have redundant backups, and even use BIP38 for additional security.\n\nTails/Whonix/Tor really only need to be involved in this process if you are attempting to conceal your activity beyond the pseudonymous nature of bitcoin.\n\n": 1}}}
