It is my current understanding that sellers on OpenBazaar have to host their own node continuously to be listed in the OB search engine. \n\nSecurity wise there is not really much difference...the risk is all the same as it involves three people; buyer, seller, and escrow agent and a rating system for each person. Obviously bitwasp users can use web of trusts, or the internal rating system, or a combination of both. \n\n\nThe benefits of Bitwasp over OpenBazaar are the following:\n1. Far easier for sellers to use, and easier for them to stay anonymous. Assuming they can find a marketplace that is willing to host their products. \n\n2. Since bitwasp can be modified on a per implementation basis, and isn\'t all together in a (decentralized) network changes can be made more easily as there is no need for consensus or compatibility. I believe this makes it easier for this software to be adapted towards its own Lyft, AirBNB, Freelance, or item specific marketplaces, have features like affiliate programs, force encryption or prevent it, etc. \n\n3. Finding escrow agents... with OB both the seller and buyer need to find a trusted escrow agent - with BW, if you are on the same marketplace that is already agreed upon. \n\n\nReally the advantages of OpenBazaar over Bitwasp is that if absolutely no marketplace will accept your items, and you don\'t want to run your own marketplace... OpenBazzaar is an option, assuming you can find a buyer and a an escrow agent who trust one another and themselves. \n\nAlso OB is it\'s own "Google shopping" where all products are searchable. This short coming in bitwasp is already addressed by services such as Grams, Google Shopping and other search comparison websites. \n\nReally they both have a place but I think Bitwasp is a more complete package and more easily adaptable and easier for buyers and sellers to use. \n': 2, 'Hello.

Perhaps the "three days" or "a few days" is about how long it typically takes for an unconfirmed transaction to start disappearing from a significant number of memory pools (presuming the original transaction is not being re-broadcasted somehow, typically by the sending wallet). I\'ve seen that time frame mentioned several times in threads about under-fee transactions taking too long and asking what can be done about it. Presumably, by that time enough memory pools will have dropped the original transaction that a second transaction using the same inputs (but including a proper fee) can be sent. The second transaction would get mined into a block quickly, at which point the first transaction apparently gets removed from any memory pools that still have it.  \n\nThis begs the question, does a long-running node get its memory pool cluttered up by unconfirmed transactions? If so, that could have an affect on program stability in a resource limited system. Maybe a time to live of, say, 96 hours for unconfirmed transactions would guard against this.

And then there's the smallest unit (currently) called a Satoshi, which is 1/100,000,000th of a BTC.\n\nEither way you don't have to worry about there being 20 Bitshillings per BTC and 12 Satopennies per shilling or any such nonsense.": 2, "It depends on where you're doing your purchasing.

It is a neat and simple word that just fits well in the perception of people using "bit".\n\nThat\'s why my bet is that "bit" will win over "uBTC" or "micros" or "mics" in common usage.\n\n*Disclosure: I also like the term  "bit", so I am not neutral* ;-)': 1, "And that's fine for a currency governed by bureaucrats.

An elaborate point/reward system is in the works so you can expect free goodies, too!

Or sometimes people in very different geographical areas where plain arbitrage can\'t reach so neither can their fiat payments to one another.\n\nFinally, most advertisers back up their trades with lump-sum access to a central exchange.
