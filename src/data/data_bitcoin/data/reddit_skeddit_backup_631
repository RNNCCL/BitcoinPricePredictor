The export industry would not have collapsed it simply would not have been as large. \n\nCentral banking was setup to try and prevent the creditor class from having to suffer losses on their bond portfolios. Debt in capitalist economies always reaches an unrepayable point due to the nature of compound interest, throwing an economy into deflation. Central banking was setup to try and mitigate around this while never adressing the core issue(compound interest), hence why in 2015 we still have the same problems arising(debt deflation). The irony is that central banking has turned what used to be regional problems into global scale.\n\nI never said anything about some plot. Central bankers cannot create VALUE. All they can do is transfer value from 1 party to another via mechanisms of THEFT namely both inflation and deflation. All surplus value created has come from labor. In the case of Switzerland workers were being robbed through debasement of the currency unit in which they are paid in for the BENEFIT of capital owners(exporters). The central bank realized they themselves faced possible insolvency because their balance sheet was swelling with Euros. These euros were being recycled into EU government debt namely Germany(inflating the value of bonds). So the central bank was financing wholesale capital destruction(gov spending) while at the same time debasing Swiss worker wages for short term benefits accrued to Capital owners(export industry and EU bondholders). \n\nThat Swiss business owner himself admitted his largest expense is salaries and he needed the low currency to pay them. What he is not telling you is because of that his sales are also higher then they otherwise would be. Capitalism always puts capital against labor. This is a CLEAR CUT EXAMPLE. \n\nThe reason the Swiss currency is strong is because of all the products and services Switzerland produces that are highly sought after. High labor productivity and high salaries go hand in hand with high quality sought after goods. The OP business owner himself admitted that Swiss manufacturing is so advanced that many things can only be produced there, except he can't see the source of this value being labor(including his own). He thinks accumulating nominal money is the source of the wealth and he want's the central bank to subsidize his operation.": 3, 'People in the money reform movement refuse to acknowledge the source of monetary problems is the concept of compound interest, money breeding money. \n\nA successful money system would be one that is based on interest free credit. Obviously this requires trust since credit must be allocated prudently. Prudence is a virtue, and virtues are completely absent from  discussion about money nevermind in practice. This credit is backed by productive activity. Ask yourself do you want a monetary system that is built upon human productivity or artificialy scarce units that a few people possess(and everyone else must trade real wealth for)?\n\nUnfortunately certain groups of people are aware that is is easier to steal value then to produce it, this is quite evident in the bitcoin ecosystem. Like I said bitcoin solves nothing, as mans problems are more philosophical and theological then technical. People believe money itself produces value. I found it quite amusing reading the one poster who actually believes central bankers are benevolent entities safeguarding the economy while the track record speaks complete opposite. They exist for the benefit of creditors.': 1, "This is false. The central bank was buying Euros by debasing existing Francs in existence through the creation of new ones. They basically stole purchasng power from Swiss workers and transferred it to Euro customers in order to subdize Swiss exporters. The unintended consequences have been an insanely expensive Swiss housing market for example(from the new francs inflating assets).\n\nIf the central bank did not give up this ridiculous notion they would have been forced to buy hundreds of billions of Euros ad infinitum, eventually leading to central bank insolvency.\n\nThe fact that they had to stop doing this suddenly without warning anyone, shows you the utter incompetence and disasterous conditions that central banks setup in an economy. Swiss exporters do not understand that their customers are too poor to afford their products. They required the central bank to finance the purchases via currency debasement(robbing labor), this also means they most likely overinvested and overexpanded their business's(from artificial demand due to increased customer purchasing power). Now with the sudden currency shock you will have huge losses across the board(reality that the customer was poor). No evidence exists that central banking stabilizes an economy and more evidence exists that it is a huge destabilizing force. Central banking exists to steal value from those who create it(labor class) and transfer it to those who live off of it(creditor class). Keynes himself said it is easier to steal from labor via currency debasement then by nominal wage cuts.\n\nThat exporter in the reddit post will have to raise his prices, and he claims his industry is something only the Swiss can do so customers will be forced to pay regardless. He is basically upset that the Swiss central bank stopped stealing from his workers and subsidized his customers(FOR HIS BENEFIT). He goes on to complain how hell have to face the wrath of unions directly now(Goes back to what Keynes said). This is because the Swiss Central Bank was lowering wages on his behalf before, without the workers even knowing it.\n\nThe Swiss export industry honestly believes that they should be entitled to export insanely expensive products ad infinitum. We are talking about for example watches that cost an average $20k+ per piece. Obviously this is unsustainable without customers also growing wealth at the same if not faster rate then Switzerland is. Considering most of the worlds economies are in stagnation, it time the Swiss face up to reality and realize nobody can afford their luxuries anymore.\n\nBitcoin has it's flaws but there is no single party that can suddenly come in and shock the system with piss poor planning.

Use Localbitcoins to arrange a meeting with somebody who wants to sell you Bitcoins. Give him cash to get Bitcoins. If you are very concerned about getting scammed in person or mugged then meet at a public place and use the LBC SMS escrow service.\n\nAlternately, find a BTC ATM in your area.

There are "light wallets" that only download the headers of each block (an extremely small amount of data) and they can be used to broadcast and confirm transactions quickly.  Full nodes and miners are the only people who need to have access to the full blockchain, and for various reasons the size of the blockchain won\'t be an issue going forward.\n\n>If block chains are only posted every 20 minutes or so, doesn\'t that limit the ability of a casual consumer to make purchases with it?\n\nNo, because it\'s possible to confirm the validity of a transaction without the transaction appearing in the blockchain yet.  Your computer can just look at the signature and that will mathematically prove the correct private key was used to sign the transaction (and for the amount stated).  Once the transaction is "broadcast" to the nodes, it\'s only a matter of time until it\'s published in a forthcoming block.  So the odds of a "double spend" happening are extremely low (and you can minimize that risk by ensuring the person sending you funds includes a decent-sized miner\'s fee).  The only time you\'d want to sit around for several blocks is when you\'re making a large transaction (several thousand dollars worth or more).\n\n>Could they really respond to a successful attack on the system?\n\nIt depends on the type of attack.  But the beauty of Bitcoin is that each block acts as a kind of "save point", like in a videogame.  So if there is a worst-case-scenario where someone figures out how to completely compromise the encryption, we\'d at least still have the transaction history prior to their attack, and so in theory we could figure out a way to port the blockchain to a different type of validating server network.  But that\'s a big "if".  People trust Bitcoin as much as they trust the encryption techniques underlying it, which are military-grade.  And they\'ve been around a long time.\n\nMy recommendation is to assume a 50/50 outcome for your investment, no matter how enthusiastic or cautious you are.

No one runs a full node on their phone.  Most wallets use SPV and so they don't need to store any blocks.\n\n> My understanding is that for Bitcoin transactions to be truly finalized, it needs to be posted as part of a block in the block chain.\n\nYes, but there are ways to do instant confirmations if you're willing to add a trusted third party.  There's even a post on the front page right now about doing this using micropayment channels.  Another approach is in a BIP proposed by Greenaddress which is an extension to the payment protocol for doing instant confirmations.  Even though those technologies aren't in widespread use yet, most merchants already accepting 0 confirmation transactions.  Especially point-of-sale transactions.  I've bought food, coffee, and beer with Bitcoin and have never had to wait for a confirmation when paying.\n\nRegarding your third point, hard forks are possible.  We are going to have to hard fork to raise the 1MB block limit.  If there's a need to hard fork for security reasons, it can happen.

So you have a number of options:\n\n1. Do a "double tap": User taps, takes the device back, confirms, then taps again to transmit the transaction. (I think Google Wallet does something like this.)\n2. Confirm beforehand: User confirms, then taps and everything can happen in one go. The disadvantage is, that you confirm the transaction before you have seen the details. (I believe Google Wallet can also work this way.)\n3. Tap the phone, then establish a Bluetooth connection which allows you to do all necessary communication even if the user takes the device back.\n\nI felt option 3 was the nicest UX, but there are definitely pros and cons to all options.\n\nUsing only Bluetooth: I don\'t know what you would have in mind there exactly, but you then have to be careful, that you are not picking up a spoofed payment request instead of the one from the merchant.

Cryptocurrency in general (I\'ll say most) allow for transparency in the macro sense and programmability in the micro world. Neither of these are achievable in fiat currencies without years of legislation and fundamental payment system changes. Most every crypto currency has these features; bitcoin was the first one to prove it is possible. \n\nHow is this possible anyways?\n\n1) Open source software: perhaps the most important feature of Bitcoin was that the software was created with an open source license. This simply means that any human can read, contribute to, or fork (create a copy and change the code without permission) the software proving transparency. Anyone who wants to can view the parameters of the protocol, (money supply, distribution mechanism, security features, etc) and, if not satisfied, can suggest changes to the protocol or even create their own coin by forking the software and changing the code to their liking. Its important to note that most crypto currencies are forks of bitcoin if you follow their lineage.\n\n2) Extensive testing by community: when the Bitcoin protocol was created, bitcoins had no fiat price. Their value was absolutely zero. This allowed for an environment where early adopters could become familiar with the system, could attempt to break the Bitcoin protocol, and could decide if each bitcoin actually worked as a store of value. It was traded for over a year before programmers and economists actively involved in it indirectly spawned a monetary demand. The supply was huge, the demand was tiny, therefore Bitcoin had bitcoins that were almost worthless (at that time in a monetary sense). The only factor that changed over time was the daily increasing trust people had that the protocol could not be broken. This leads me to my last point.\n\n\n3) Global mining pools (distributed security + monetary incentive): most people understand how the miners secure the network with computer power, specifically hashing functions. This computer power is global and decentralized. Any attack on the network would require more computing power today than could ever actually used against it. I don\'t want to go too far into how mining works here as there are many better resources than I on this subject. I will just say that the miners do work for selfish reasons (monetary incentive, bitcoin distribution). The system rewards the miners for being selfish and "selling" computer power to the network. The system punishes miners who grow too large (mining pools) and attempt to change the blockchain. In addition, there is no business with the power over Bitcoin to change it; only the collective community of users have that power. With no figurehead to attack and discredit, Bitcoin operates almost as an artificial intelligence similar to the internet. No one could "pull the plug" tomorrow, even an adversary with great funds and computing power. Because of these parameters, the network is secure and dynamic, growing or shrinking to meet the needs of the networks users. \n\nThese are not all inclusive but I think if a cryptocurrency lacks any one of these 3 features, the crypto community should be weary at best of the promised results.\n': 1, 'Do you agree with OP that anyone who lost money is a fool who deserves it?': 1, "Was face book premined because only a few people held equity in it before the IPO?\n\nNo.\n\nA premined coin is literally impossible to mine any % of it.

Since ~~in both cases~~ it was pretty clear to everyone that the Old Bitcoin was bugged, everybody migrated to the new one without hesitation. \n\nOTOH, If there\'s a hard-fork and a significant amount of people refuse the change and keep using the old version of the software, then things can get complicated. \n\nFirst, everyone who had coins prior to the fork will now have the same amount of coins on both systems, "Old Bitcoin" and "New Bitcoin". If both systems keep living, it\'s hard to predict how the price will behave. People who believe in the New Bitcoin would try to change their coins in the Old Bitcoin against coins in the New Bitcoin, and vice-versa. Eventually the price difference will tell which Bitcoin has more support. Talk about volatility. Miners would obviously adapt to the price and mine where there\'s more money to be made. So people here saying miners are the one to decide are not really correct. It\'s usage that will decide where mining power will be employed.\n\nOh, and transacting with coins prior to the fork on this scenario could be quite complicated. Think about it. You had money in address A which existed prior to the fork. You want to spend that on the New Bitcoin chain to pay some merchant who\'s accepting New Bitcoin. But address A also has money on the Old Bitcoin chain, and any transaction you send on the new chain could as well be duplicated on the old one (assuming the tx is compatible to both chains, which could easily be the case). If you want to pay one guy with your new bitcoins, and this guy is a thief, he may just publish the transaction on the Old Bitcoin network and get those coins of yours too.\nSo, it would be in the interest of everyone who had coins prior to the fork to send them to *different* addresses they control on each side of the fork, in order to be sure you now own two different wallets, with Old and New Bitcoins. Once you\'ve done it, you exchange them and adapt your portfolio to any percentage of New vs Old Bitcoins you would like to hold. Imagine the chaos that would be to non tech-savvy users, they would be more lost than a goose on a snowstorm. That would be a PR nightmare and I\'m afraid it would hurt both Bitcoins after all.\n\nEdit: The overflow bug could be fixed with a soft-fork.': 2, 'Joke or citation?': 1, 'The overflow bug was fixed with a soft fork.\n\nSome people don\'t consider the Berkeley DB thing a hard fork because old nodes weren\'t behaving deterministically. After the change (BIP 50), old nodes would reject new blocks only "randomly". In fact, I\'ve heard that old nodes without the BIP 50 change can still sometimes download the entire modern block chain. Also, I think that a network full of only old nodes could still experience this problem if any miners were using somewhat non-standard policy.\n\nHowever, I often do consider the Berkeley DB thing a hard fork -- I just forgot about it. :)': 1, 'But what does a holder who is not a miner have to do?': 1, 'So you simply have to make addresses in the new Blockchain.

': 2, "Basically when there is a fork you have two blockchains and can basically spend the same bitcoin twice, once on each  blockchain. In the past this fork only lasted for 3 to 4 hours. Basically if we were to have a fork the bitcoin ecosystem would stop for a while, while we wait for one of the forks to win.  During the fork business would not accept any bitcoin because we don't know which fork would win. Once we find out which fork wins everything goes on.  \n\n\nWays to have a fork without stopping the ecosystem is to say that the changes won't take affect for another 500 blocks so that gives everyone a chance to change to the new software days in advance, or not change to the new software. Whoever has the majority hashing power when we get to that block wins and the network never stops.\n\nIm not a programmer but have been involved with bitcoin since 2012 so I'm pretty sure this is how it works but maybe someone more technical can explain it better.

Even if every other Bitcoin user on Earth switches to new rules, your non-upgraded full node will ignore them unless you also switch to the new rules. This is what makes a hard fork "hard" -- even if everyone agrees on a hard fork, *every* full node needs up upgrade, which is difficult.\n\nExcept in emergencies, hard forks will be scheduled one or two *years* in advance. Most people won\'t need to worry about it because they\'ll already be using an upgraded client by the time the change actually happens.': 3, 'has a fork successfully happened already in the past? if so, why was it done?': 2, 'A hardfork is basically making an altcoin with everyone having the same amount of money they have in the Bitcoin system and hoping they all migrate over to the new altcoin. If you only a fraction of people migrate over then there is confusion over which currency is the "real" Bitcoin. Because two currencies separate are worth less than one currency as a whole, it harms Bitcoin unless the transition is very well executed.\n\nIn other words, hardforks are dangerous.': 1, 'No.\n\nIn a hard fork, the network is split in two, and each person must individually decide to either stick with the old rules and old network or move to the new rules and new network. Miners are mostly irrelevant here. No one on the old network will automatically end up on the new network, even if *every* miner supports the new network. (Assuming you\'re running a full node and not a lightweight node).\n\nIn a soft fork, the majority of mining power adds a new rule to the current network. Any miners who don\'t support the new rule will (in most cases) have all of their future blocks rejected until they upgrade. Full nodes will automatically be subject to the rule change as long as the majority of mining power is enforcing the new rule. Only certain types of changes can be done in a soft fork. The max block size can\'t be increased in a soft fork, for example. The term "soft fork" is a bit confusing because soft fork changes often don\'t result in any substantial forking of the block chain.': 3, 'As I said, first you should ensure you control two different wallets, one for each system, with different addresses. Addresses from before the fork should be emptied to address after the fork you control. And that might not be as simple as it seems since any asshole could make your life difficult by republishing the transactions you send in one network to the other, just for the pleasure of screwing people.\n\nThen, if/when you manage to separate your coins like that, you just exchange them as if they were different cryptos.

Then you just chop off the last four bytes, double-sha256 those first 21 bytes, and then add to the end the first four bytes of the double-sha256.  For example, you start with\n\n    1SomeTextGoesHere\n\n(making sure that you use only proper base58 characters).  Then you add more text to the end, in this case I'll just use X's to fill up the space:\n\n    1SomeTextGoesHerexxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\n\nso when I base58 decode it, it's 25 bytes of hex, which are:\n\n    0004e170c2b578eec7aeac375c75163f2a424ec9b719e9dc11\n\nThen I take off the last 4 bytes (8 chars):\n\n    0004e170c2b578eec7aeac375c75163f2a424ec9b7\n\nthen I sha256 the raw binary version of that hex and get:\n\n    1f0734ce6c789906ae00c6e9e243d6c217571a93a83e4578411869adf1081d17\n\nand then I sha256 that result and get:\n\n    2abc068de7110e7aa6288d0ff687bdebb3166606ac33a206ed842951ae463c26\n\nThe first four bytes of which are:\n\n    2abc068d\n\nSo I tack that onto the end of the previous thing and get:\n\n    0004e170c2b578eec7aeac375c75163f2a424ec9b72abc068d\n\nWhich I then re-convert back into base58 and get the final bitcoin address of:\n\n    1SomeTextGoesHerexxxxxxxxxxyPuMqW\n\nBase58 encoding is just like base64 or base 10 or base 16, it's just a large number represented in a different way, with more characters.  So that's why the hex changes completely when you just add a single character to the end of a base58 string, because you're not just adding a digit in hex form, you're increasing the number by a power of 58 and then some, so the hex representation of that number is an entirely different number.  So don't be alarmed when you decode base58 and get entirely different hex when you add or subtract a character from the base58 encoding of it.\n\nThat's why we filled it with misc characters at the beginning step -- so that we were on the right order of magnitutde, so that when we changed the last chars to be the checksum, the beginning number (and the representing base58 chars) would remain the same.\n\nBase58 encoding really is just converting the base, just as you would convert a decimal number to binary or to hex.  It's just that in bitcoin software, you also pretty much always do that checksum in addition to converting the base, because things like addresses and private keys are things that users may mis-type and so you want the checksum there to make sure the user has typed it correctly and you will know they've messed up if they change a digit.  So the decoding process includes double checking the checksum.\n\nAlso, worth noting that base58 denotes 1 for zero instead of zero, since the base58 character set doesn't use zeros.": 5, "Be careful about leading 00 bytes in hex and leading 1's in Base58.  For example, decoding a bitcoin address that begins with a 1 will yeild hex that begins with 00, so if you treat it as a *number* rather than as raw data, that 00 might be lopped off.  0004 in hex is the same number as 04, but 0004 is a different piece of data than 04.  So when you decode with base58, you are treating it as a number and converting the base, but then you have to go back and make sure you have the correct number of leading 00's or 1's, since the number is actually a certain amount of bytes of data and those leading zeros matter.": 1, 'Edited the text for that.
