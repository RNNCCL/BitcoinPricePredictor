Indeed not surprising.': 7, "Miners don't want to hard fork without Core devs.": 19, 'Consensus in Bitcoin is a term used to describe the aggregate policy nodes use to identify the active chain. Everything else is politics. The network currently ignores >1MB blocks, so the OP statement can\'t be true.\n\nThe word "consensus" gets bandied about a lot as a way to manipulate a political process. Over time, the tactic loses its effectiveness as the disparity between words (what miners and node operators say they will do) and actions (the software node operators actually use) becomes clear.': 12, 'If miners, or even a majority of the ecosystem, decide to remove protocol rules (ie, hardfork), everyone who does not adopt the changes will ignore their forked chain entirely, as if it didn\'t exist. This is necessary to Bitcoin\'s design so that each person has autonomous control of their own money, and the rules can\'t be changed out from under them. So in a scenario such as this, you would end up with two independent cryptocurrencies, the original Bitcoin, and the forked chain. So long as the original Bitcoin exists, it clearly has well-established usage of the name "Bitcoin", so the new chain must select a new name or it its users would be essentially committing fraud by misrepresenting their new altcoin as "Bitcoin".\n\nFor a situation where Bitcoin *itself* hardforks, the previous chain must cease being used. The only way this is true, is if literally everyone using Bitcoin decides to switch to the new rules. A super-majority of maybe 95+% of the economy (not miners) *might* be able to coerce the remaining 5% to switch, but it is very uncertain at what point this would be successful, and in some cases may be ethically dubious since it is literally forcing that 5% to devalue their money. Note that significant uncertainty of success is generally considered an unacceptable gamble for a currency of Bitcoin\'s market-cap. Because of these (and other) reasons, it would be very irresponsible to try to proceed with any hardfork until reasonable certainty can be established that there is no significant objection (from even a minority of the economy) to the *exact* changes in the proposal.\n\nFurthermore, even without a significant objection from the community, it is uncertain if there may be a significant part of the economy *entirely ignorant* of the proposal (a *lot* of Bitcoin users, surprisingly enough, seem to be unaware of the entire blocksize discussion!). So a hardfork also needs to consider these users, and any attempt should be done in a way that doesn\'t put them at jeopardy of *accidentally* forking - which is what will happen if someone fails to change to the new rules even out of ignorance.\n\nSo applying this to the hardfork that I and some other devs agreed to propose, the current [tentative] plan for the proposal as I see it is:\n\n1. We must determine what changes are likely to gain consensus with the community. (Although the proposal is contractually required to handle ~2 MB of current pre-segwit transactions, whether or not we believe the community will accept this change.)\n2. The code needs good review and documentation, on all its effects, so the community can make an informed decision.\n3. A soft hardfork process will be used so that old nodes are not compromised.\n4. Users must indicate through some to-be-determine mechanism that they agree to the changes.\n5. Miners must gauge user consensus, and signal readiness with a configuration option *only* when they see the entire economy has consented.\n6. When this readiness is signalled, nodes of users who have consented to the changes will switch to the new rules. If there are users who have objected to the changes, *their own nodes only* will automatically switch PoW algorithm (note this condition would never trigger so long as miners stick to the plan, but is necessary to prevent someone from forcing miners to signal before the network has consented).': 9, "Economic Darwinism is not a game I care to play.

The difference between permission and decentralized blockchains was the best part.': 1, 'private blockchains are not about value transfer, at least not in the sense that bitcoin is. they are about data management, record keeping, making sure an infrastructure witnesses zero down time (especially relevant in vital services whether that be hostpital systems, financial or emergency services and many others), huge reduction in associated costs of infrastructure and infrastructure maintenance. \n\nsome less vital but still highly important aspects could be things like record keeping of department funding/transactions etc etc in large, multinational companies. there are numerous cases for private blockchains, just like there are numerous use cases for local area networks(private computer networks in organisations, colleges companies etc), though they service different but sometimes related use cases as wide area networks(internet).\n\nthey would also mean that needing to maintain back ups becomes a non issue if multiple nodes are running as each node would always be fully up to date. if the bitcoin can be maintained at 100% uptime since its birth there is no reason private chains cant replicate this track record. the transactions on the private chains could also be obfuscated or encrypted so that only the nodes of the chain, or a subset of the nodes of the chain can see some, all or selected transactions\n\nthe catch is that, the two go hand in hand. the internet would be drastically limited if there was no such thing as LAN\'s and vice versa. when the two are connected, the combined local and wide area networks are suddenly a lot more useful - if its not, why would this be the set up of pretty much every commercial and educational entity on the planet?\n\nso while private blockchains will handle internal record keeping and data management, infrastructure cost reduction and increase in infrastructure reliability, public chains will handle the cross boarding, inter-organisational or similar trasactions. \n\ni dont think consumers will transact on the main blockchain, which ever that ends up being. it would be more like the likes of mastercard running a private blockchain that can handle thousands of transactions per second as their back bone infrastructure, and the private chain also supporting smart contracts that link private chains through a main public "real" chain. \n\nbanks will also run private chains with links to other banks through the main chain totally eliminating all need for intermediaries that cause such huge delays and fees in international banking because if a banks private chain can initiate a trustless transaction to another bank via smart contract integration between public and private, transaction speeds from bank A to bank B is reduced to that of the conformation time of the main chain. \n\nin this scenario you would have say mastercard running a private chain, recording all their users transactions in a zero down time, cost effective and much more reliable environment with transactions between them and their bank partners(and between the banks) being initiated partly, or possibly mostly, by executing private chain smart contracts that initiate public chain transactions. \n\ncrypto currencies wont disappear simply because of the proliferation of private chains, private chains will proliferate the use of public chains and multiply the number of use cases exponentially as more and more companies/indivuduals/organisations/governments join this cryptographic network. \n\n disclosure: i am far from a visionary... its being done already and its already being put into action... http://mijin.io/en/about-mijin': 10, "Well, we all would, but consider the limitations.\nThe bitcoin blockchain is transparent, meaning you expose data and metadata (meta can't be encrypted on bitcoin blockchain).
