How do you see these large institutions using the blockchain without really getting into bitcoin? Do you agree that a single satoshi can represent anything from a list detailing ownership of one or more physical or virtual objects? or perhaps be the incarnation of a smart contract? When you say they are inseparable, do you mean at a technical level that you cannot have one without the other, or do you feel that larger investments in the currency side of Bitcoin are required in order to participate in the ecosystem?\n\nIn my view, Bitcoin will end up with at least two very different groups of uses and users. There will be the huge institutions that are regularly attaching ownership and contracts to individual satoshis (meaning very little actual cash tied up in BTC) and "end users" like us using it like a currency. The institutions will get the immutable record for free on the backs of the miners and the end users will end up financing the whole thing with miner\'s fees. In that regard, I agree that they cannot be separated. However, if a huge institution can track ownership of 100 million items (each of which may in turn be DATABASES full of items!) for $228 ATM, then I also feel like their involvement in the currency side of the ecosystem will be negligible to the point of effectively non-existent. \n\nDo you focus on the fact that they cannot be unlinked technically or do you feel that the huge institutions will somehow be required to make huge investments on the currency side in order to enjoy the benefits of the blockchain? IMO of course they can\'t be separated, but they can also do all the stuff they want to do in the blockchain using some of the cash in the cafeteria lady\'s pocket.': 1, "Whatever you do, don't mention the war!

I think people understand the importance of keeping the internet open and unrestricted. Society just doesn\'t have that association with finance because it\'s never existed before.\n\nThere will also be products/services that are only going to be available to users of decentralized cryptocurrencies.

Many measure security by hashing power, I think it may also make sense to consider bitcoin market capitalization, which in turn determines how much investment will be made in the mining hardware.\n\nBitcoin is also money. So you can record an item in blockchain and transfer its ownership to another person, while at the same time demanding payment for that item through wire transfer for example, or you can transfer the value via bitcoin.

The trust is created by different and mutually exclusive participants involved in maintaining the integrity of the blockchain and ensuring there are no fraudulent entries. The reward for putting computing power towards maintaining the ledger is the bitcoin (or any other alt-coin) token and acts as an incentive for the miners to maintain the ledger. Therefore other blockchains without a token to transmit information across it would not work as the trust would not be there, as no one is going to put computing power towards something for free.  The argument that a financial institution/s could create its own blockchain (without the need for the reward token) would therefore not work as the institution would be responsible for its upkeep and therefore the trust is not there. \n\nSo yes secure is a relative term, but a blockchain that has a token as a reward for the mining will be perceived much as much more secure as one that is centrally maintained\n": 1, "No, this is something that is potentially taken very seriously at the BBC, they have procedures in place to deal with credible complaints.

If I understand you correctly, it will be in the best interest of the large institutions to invest in mining to further enhance the security of the blockchain. That definitely makes sense if they're going to start using it to permanently record their activities. Additionally, the monetary value of bitcoin the currency will drive investment in mining. Finally, if the large institutions would consider using it as a currency, they will eventually move their payment activities off of fiat to BTC in order to make use of the dual capabilities -- ownership and smart contracts along with currency transfer.\n\nI guess I feel like the institutions want nothing to do with holding or using BTC as a currency at this point and will be perfectly happy letting us use it the way we see fit. It's monopoly money to them. I think investigating blockchain is a way to dip a toe in the water vs jumping in head first. The holy grail to them is the free (or nearly free) access to a perfectly trustable and immutable database. They absolutely do not care one bit about the fluctuating price -- only that the network is still operating as planned. As soon as they have to get into the mining game it suddenly becomes much less valuable to them. Especially if all that investment is leading to something as intangible as improved security. As an Enterprise IT Architect, I can talk about tangible improvements to security all day. But at some point, there's a crossover between how much they need to spend and how much safety they expect to gain from those investments.\n\nWhat are the chances that someone that will execute a 51% attack and try to steal BTC? Wouldn't that pull the rug out and reduce the value of all BTC across the board to zero at this point? Even if the chances of that happening are non-zero, how much do we expect institutions to invest to prevent that from happening? Do you think they will ever understand the ROI of protecting against the possibility of this happening? Also, is there a point at which they would realize that a heavy investment will help everyone and not just themselves? Do we expect them to do good for the world instead of just themselves? Do we expect them to pass on any savings in operational costs on to us by moving key functions to the blockchain, or do we think they're going to claim it's a wash against the new mining costs? And if they start mining, what do we expect them to do with the BTC they mine? Use it for billions of spots on the blockchain? If each BTC can be used to manage say, 20 to 100 million databases then they only need to mine one BTC a month to get enough spots for their typical use. Especially if they just transfer the BTC within their own accounts, attaching content and smart contracts. This points back to the fact that they don't have to care one iota about the exchange rate at any given moment -- just that the network is still operating.\n\nIt sounds like your long term view may be much further out than mine or where VCs are operating today. I just don't see the major institutions increasing hashing power to improve the security of the blockchain, nor using BTC to transfer value in a significant way for a long time. I can see the world's 10 largest banks offering gimmicks to customers, such as low fee bank accounts that claim to use the blockchain for asset management or even customer-to-customer crypto transfers. I don't see anything preventing your current view of the future eventually coming to be, but I do see a decade or more in between their first forays into the blockchain and investing in mining to improve the security for everyone. I also don't know if I ever see the biggest ones moving from fiat to BTC for transfer of value. They are just too entrenched.\n\nMy experience draws upon 20 years in IT from individual through large enterprise infrastructure design and back end trade processing for (one of?) the world's largest insurance company before that.
