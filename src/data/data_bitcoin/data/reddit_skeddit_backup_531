I hope Coinapult resolves the issue without too much of a financial hit.\n\nHot wallets are a real challenge for any bitcoin business, because a hot wallet by definition is used to quickly and automatically send funds to a bitcoin address. The key words are 'quickly' and 'automatically'. That makes security very hard to guarantee.\n\nA multi-sig wallet - as some erroneously suggest - is not a magic bullet that would secure hot wallets. There are a couple, but limited, edge-cases that multi-sig could protect a hot wallet against (like an inside job, hacking the hot wallet server, others), but anytime you automate the processing of outgoing transactions, you open a major security attack vector. A hot wallet attack could target a hot wallet and drain its funds long before anyone becomes wise to the attack.\n\nMulti-sig could store a couple keys on two separate hot servers, for use in automation of transactions. Each server would have to individually 'agree' to the transaction and sign it for it to happen. A compromise of one server by an outside hacker or inside employee would prevent theft. A company would have to keep these servers physically separate (geo-distributed) and not give any one employee credentials to both. Problem is, geo-distribution adds latency, which itself hurts the 'quickly' goal of a hot wallet, though perhaps not too badly. \n\nThere are a lot of risk vectors to consider when using a hot wallet, and I've definitely only touched on some here.\n\n\nCoinsetter doesn't use hot wallets, hence no risk of any hot wallet attack to their exchange.\n\n": 3, "We have an FAQ [located here](http://bitgoinc.com/help/) and the feature comparison table between personal and enterprise wallets is [located here](https://www.bitgo.com/pricing).

One nice thing about `empty` is that it's a language construct, not a function, and will not emit errors while attempting to access keys/members that don't exist.

In this case your HTML output is being done by the included template above, and by including this trailing tag you are needlessly outputting a space.

I checked some of the code (not all of it) but it looks like they never get access to the decrypted private key. \n\n> Second, and relatedly, why do you keep one of the keys when we could just have one key we keep ourselves?\n\nBecause letting a 3^rd party manage one of the 3 keys adds security in this case. It means that an attacker now has to compromise multiple targets to get at your coins.\n\n> Finally, what is this "master public key" you send in the verification email and why in the world are you sending it to me in an email?\n\nThis is the public side of the 3^rd key they hold. It doesn\'t matter if this is public. It\'s not sensitive (as in, someone can steal your coins). Worst case is someone can figure out which transactions are yours after you send them.\n\n> The email implies that it can be used to bypass my password as well as 2fa.\n\nNot at all. You can\'t sign any transactions using a public key. Only with a private key. They are still a \'gatekeeper\' so to speak (that is, unless you use your 2 keys to yank your bitcoins out). \n\n>That means that anyone who gets into an email account of a user with this email stored somewhere can hack their account.\n\nThis is not true. \n\nEdit: correction.': 6, "I'm just browsing through your code and noticed a few things.\n\nI noticed that you're deriving your keys in order, [here](https://github.com/Ninkip2p/NinkiWallet/blob/aaa71d13f042bcdfa8a1e135abd7095aa84b99c0/src/ninki-engine.js#L2206) and [here](https://github.com/Ninkip2p/NinkiWallet/blob/aaa71d13f042bcdfa8a1e135abd7095aa84b99c0/src/ninki-engine.js#L2285) and [aren't sorting the keys](http://sourceforge.net/p/bitcoin/mailman/bitcoin-development/thread/54B6BC3F.6050805%40haskoin.com/), which makes your backup order dependent.\n\nAlso, I noticed that you're not using [BIP45](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0045.mediawiki) for your multi-sig key paths (see [here](https://github.com/Ninkip2p/NinkiWallet/blob/aaa71d13f042bcdfa8a1e135abd7095aa84b99c0/src/ninki-engine.js#L1834) and [here](https://github.com/Ninkip2p/NinkiWallet/blob/aaa71d13f042bcdfa8a1e135abd7095aa84b99c0/src/ninki-engine.js#L1989)). Is there a specific reason for this? \n\nMinor nitpick, why are you encoding the pubkeys with base 58 [during transport](https://github.com/Ninkip2p/NinkiWallet/blob/aaa71d13f042bcdfa8a1e135abd7095aa84b99c0/src/ninki-engine.js#L2470)? Those keys are never exposed to the user and don't have to be encoded in a readable form (I'm probably missing something).\n\nI see that you're doing a [path query for a friend address](https://github.com/Ninkip2p/NinkiWallet/blob/aaa71d13f042bcdfa8a1e135abd7095aa84b99c0/src/ninki-engine.js#L2359) when trying to create a transaction. Why not send friends an xpub triplet that they can derive endless keys from?\n\nAlso noticed that you're not clearing out sensitive data when you're done with it (good example is the hot and cold buffers used in [this](https://github.com/Ninkip2p/NinkiWallet/blob/aaa71d13f042bcdfa8a1e135abd7095aa84b99c0/src/ninki-engine.js#L662) function). Might want to have a look at that.\n\nEdit: I also checked your [random generator](https://github.com/Ninkip2p/NinkiWallet/blob/aaa71d13f042bcdfa8a1e135abd7095aa84b99c0/src/ninki-engine.js#L143) used for [wallet creation](https://github.com/Ninkip2p/NinkiWallet/blob/aaa71d13f042bcdfa8a1e135abd7095aa84b99c0/src/ninki-engine.js#L672). Looks OK, but you're only using a single source of random values.\n\n~~Lastly, [bitcoinjs-lib's signer](https://github.com/bitcoinjs/bitcoinjs-lib/blob/master/src/eckey.js#L80) doesn't look like it supports [RFC6979](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6979).~~ I was [wrong](https://github.com/bitcoinjs/bitcoinjs-lib/blob/master/src/ecdsa.js#L84).\n": 9, "Ok, I understand. But please explain why you say I will need the master public key for some reason if I lose my password and 2fa. I shouldn't need anything so long as I have my pass phrases, correct?\n\nAlso, what is that verification phrase in the settings?\n\nThe only benefit I think has been pointed out to this scheme over a pure spv client is that of separated multisig keys.

It would assuage my concerns somewhat to know that in the event your servers were down, I had a simple tool to recover my wallet in another standalone app or with a standalone script.  Since your scheme is quite different from other wallets like breadwallet, it would otherwise take a lot of work to actually recover and transfer Ninki funds to a different HD wallet...\n\nThanks. \n\nEdit: I see now that you do have this sort of recovery tool.
