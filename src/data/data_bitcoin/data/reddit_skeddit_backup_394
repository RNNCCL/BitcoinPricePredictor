Why has it become the most dreadful menace to the future of bitcoin? \n\n>My best guess is that the promises that the Blockcstream guys made to their investors, when they got their funding, depend on there being no block size increase, no matter how modest.  That would explain their uncompromising and hysterical opposition to the increase -- and the changes that they are making to the protocol.\n\n>Specifically, I guess that they promised investors that bitcoin network would become congested by 2016, and then users would be forced to move to some "overlay network" that would carry most of the payment traffic, with only occasional settlements being made on the old bitcoin network.  \n\n>Blockstream (they must have said) would then be the key player in that "overlay space", because they already were developing the technology that will make the overlay network possible (sidechains, at the time).  Moreover, since several key developers were partners or employees of Blocksrteam, they had commit control of BitcoinCore, the "official" implementation of the protocol; so they would be able to make any change that they needed to the protocol (like new opcodes), while blocking any change that competitors may need, or that might make the overlay network economically unattractive -- such as a block size increase.  \n\n>But (the investors must have asked) if the capacity of the bitcoin network itself is not increased, the number of transactions will forever be limited to 300\'000 per day; so how will mining continue to be viable while the block reward gets halved?  Well, Blockstream\'s forecast (and this is no guess) is that by 2016, as the network becomes congested, there will arise a "fee market", where bitcoin users would have to offer higher and higher fees in order to buy space on the next block.  If the average transaction fee increased to 1.5 USD or more, the revenue from fees (450\'000 USD/day) would compensate the halving of the block reward, and there would be no drop in the hashpower.    \n\n>To make that "fee market" more "efficient", Blockstream was counting on a couple of changes to the queue-management part of the core software ("replace-by-fee" and "child-pays-for-parent") that would allow clients to increment the fees of transactions that were stuck in the queue, and thus jump over other transactions with smaller fees. \n\n>According to this plan, the bitcoin network would be worth using only for large-value transactions, including the "export" of bitcoins to sidechains and settlements between the sidechains.  (Since then it became clear that sidechains will not work as intended, but Blockstream found a new vaporware to take their place in the plan, the Lightning Network.)  Most of the individual users, and services like BitPay and Bitstamp, would be forced to move to the overlay network.  \n\n>If that is the plan that they sold to their investors, their attitude would made perfect sense.  Gavin\'s proposal to increase the block size not only would postpone the need for the overlay network by many years, but also would show that Blockstream did not have control of the protocol.   The investors who bought those claims would be quite displeased, to put it mildly.  \n\n>So, at first Blockstream tried to block Gavin\'s proposal with the claim that it would make nodes terribly expensive.  Which is nonsense, since an increase in the *max size*  would not cause any immediate change to the *average size*: the latter would just continue growing (hopefully) at the current rate, and increase (gradually) beyond 1 MB only in a few years time.  But since the increase proposal has been reduced to 8 MB, they ran out of technical arguments.  So they had to resort to spreading FUD about the terrible risk of a hard fork (while doing soft forks themselves) and personal attacks on Gavin and Mike.\n\n>I have no particular admiration for Gavin.  He should have distanced himself from the Shrem Karpel\xc3\xa8s & Friends Foundation when it started to smell bad; instead, he stayed there as long as it was paying his salary, and even criticized Antonopoulos for leaving it.  And I had not noticed Mike\'s existence until a month ago.  \n\n>Yet I must recognize that they are only trying to keep bitcoin working for a few more years as it was intended to work, and as all the community has come to expect it to work.  Blockstream, on the other hand, is honoring their name, in an ironic and unintended way: their plan is to block the bitcoin stream, so that all the bitcoiners are forced to buy their water...\n\n>Moreover, Gavin and Mike have the prudence, competence, technical knowledge, and common sense that are needed to manage a large software project like bitcoin, that manages hundreds of millions of dollars for hundreds of thousands of users.  \n\n>Whereas the new core developers, while they may be expert cryptographers and clever hackers, clearly lack those qualities. They seem unable to understand Mike\'s explanation of how queues behave as the traffic approaches the channel\'s capacity.  They are unable to see the "fee market" will not be a market but a chaotic melee.  They cannot make any quantitative estimates of what the traffic and fees will be in their planned future. (Had they done so, they would see that an overlay network will not solve the scalability problem, either.)  \n\n>One of them explained that all wallet apps out there would have to be modified, so that, instead of just signing a transaction offline, issuing it, and disconnecting, the client would have to first check the queues at the nodes to guess an appropriate minimum fee F, then sign several transactions with fees F, 2F, 4F, 8F, etc., issue the first one, then remain connected to the network, so that his wallet app can watch the queues, re-issuing the other versions as needed in order to remain in front of the the other clients (who are of course doing the same), until the transaction is confirmed; or until the app runs out of pre-signed transactions, and has to ask the client whether he wants to keep trying, in which case he would have to sign a few more.

In short, I don\'t agree that avoiding financial censorship or inflation are "niche" issues that affect only a "small minority of people."

And I don\'t think Bitcoin\'s volatility is really a "unique" problem.  Its volatility is really just a symptom of its small size and the fact that it\'s still very much an experiment with an uncertain future.  The longer it survives without dying (thereby proving its staying power) and the bigger it gets the less volatile it should become.  More generally, you might be interested in [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/2jxndm/the_two_categories_of_bitcoin_skepticism_and_why/) of mine which takes a very high-level look at some of the most common economic and technical objections to Bitcoin.\n\n>edit: I would even argue that the problem of trust hasn\'t been solved, because to use bitcoin (to convert my fiat to bitcoins) I still have to trust the exchange.\n\nDude, that\'s like arguing that a person who wants to spend less money on gas won\'t be helped by trading in their gas-guzzling SUV for a Prius because, after all, they\'ll still have to *drive* the SUV to the Toyota dealership to do the exchange.  Besides, if you\'re really worried about being exposed to counterparty risk from an exchange for the period of time after you deposit your fiat and before you withdraw your coins to your own control, you can always mitigate that risk by breaking your purchases up into smaller buys (e.g., deposit $200 to exchange, buy coins, withdraw coins to your own control, repeat). \n': 1, 'Your Prius analogy would be closer to reality if you had to drive your SUV to pick up the Prius everytime you wanted to get anywhere. Until Bitcoin has it\'s own functioning, full circle economy, the reality is that you will always have to rely on the traditional banking infrastructure to convert your fiat to bitcoin.\n\nSo how do we get to a full circle bitcoin economy?\n\n/u/Noosterdam and you both claim that adoption will begin with bitcoin as a store of value. There\'s nothing inherent to bitcoin\'s design that makes it a good store of value; as historical prices will show, bitcoin is in fact prone to speculative price pressures. Just because it eventually will have a fixed supply doesn\'t mean that prices will stabilize; holding supply constant still allows changes in price depending on demand.\n\nEven if we go against the evidence and accept that bitcoin is a good store of value, what would be the mechanism through which it drives merchant adoption?  Noodsterdam - in the paragraph right after he establishes bitcoin as a store of value - says "Eventually merchants start start finding that Bitcoin spending during bubbles is a fair size of their payment pie". So which is it? Bitcoin can\'t be a good store of value and have bubbles that occur frequently enough to promote spending.\n\nSince the supply of bitcoin is fixed, and assuming widespread merchant adoption, the price of bitcoin will have already gone up drastically and will continually to go up. If that\'s the case, what incentive is there for me to spend it? The longer I hold my bitcoins, the more things I would be able to buy with it - why buy that yacht today if I can wait a few years and afford a jet (or more modestly, a slightly bigger yacht?)? \n\nYou say in your other comment that "saving money as the functional equivalent of investing in the overall economy", but with bitcoin it isn\'t, by design. In a traditional banking economy you would be right because your bank now has more money with which to invest. But with bitcoin, you are taking money out of the system: reducing the supply of money and reducing the demand for goods and services in the bitcoin economy at that particular point in time.\n': 1, 'In some ways, we agree on where bitcoin stands now; our differences in viewpoint is an issue of evolution vs design intent. Your claim is that Bitcoin can eventually evolve to become what you want it to be: frictionless transactions and a good store of value. While I don\'t discount that possibility, my problem with that is that Bitcoin was either not designed with these objectives in mind, or if it had these objectives in mind, it wasn\'t very well designed. \n\nIn meeting its primary objective of being a decentralized, trustless currency, it requires transactions to be slower and more computationally expensive than the fiat equivalents. To put it another way, the very way bitcoin was designed makes it harder for it to be improved in ways that are important to most people.\n\nCan it become faster and cheaper? Yes, but 6 years in and roughly half a billion dollars in investments later, that solution has yet to be implemented; a lot of money has been spent on making bitcoin work for the masses, and blockchain transactions have at best remain unchanged and at worst become slower and more expensive. Instead, startups have just found ways to work around its limitations (i.e. offchain transactions for speed, tying it to credit card networks for ease of spending). Bitcoin doesn\'t have a killer app not because of external factors, but because the obstacle it needs to overcome is itself.\n\nYet, by design there\'s no central authority to decisively steer bitcoin forward and improve it in fundamental ways. The block size limit debate will never achieve true consensus because everyone wants bitcoin to become different things, nevermind those who think bitcoin should never change because that\'s the way Satoshi envisioned it in the whitepaper. In bitcoin parlance, the "incentives aren\'t aligned". So bitcoin will inevitably always follow the path of least resistance, and that\'s often just the status quo. \n\nThe design choice to not have a central authority also means that bitcoin lacks a mechanism with which to stabilize prices. The result is already evident: prices driven not by transactional demand, but by speculative demand subject to wild price swings. So far, bitcoin has not shown to be a good store of value (nevermind the best or ideal store of value relative to other types of assets, even relative to the Euro during the Greek crisis), and any future price stability can only be brought about by future demand stability, which is far from a sure thing.\n\nWe agree that it\'s possible for bitcoin to become what it promises to be, we just disagree on likelihood. \n\nAs for whether holding is good for the bitcoin economy, I think what you didn\'t consider is that the kid who doesn\'t end up buying that used car doesn\'t mean that "someone else gets to enjoy the use of that car for another year." The reason the car was up for sale in the first place is because the seller wants the money he can get for the car more than he wants the car. If the kid chooses to save instead, the car will sell for less or may not sell at all, and as a result the seller perhaps can no longer afford that new car he wanted to buy. With a currency that appreciates in value, holding is a great individual strategy if everybody else spends (i.e. it\'s great for the kid to save while people are willing to pay him to mow lawns), but if everybody saved then the economy shrinks (it\'s not so great for the kid if people decide not to pay him to mow lawns, and instead mow the lawns themselves or have it mowed less frequently). \n\nMore importantly, in a less simplified world where bitcoin exists alongside traditional inflationary currencies, it will always be more preferable to spend the local one, stunting merchant adoption and making a full circle bitcoin economy less likely; in the best case scenario where bitcoin stabilizes and becomes deflationary, there\'s no mechanism to translate that speculative demand into transactional ones. There\'s no hard data to back this up, but merchants no longer accepting bitcoin and the bitpay pivot both suggest that this is already occurring.': 1, "So what would be the mechanism through which the 3 things happen? 3 seems like something startups are working on, but I don't see any reason/incentive for companies to pay employees in a currency other than the local one (bitcoin or otherwise).\n\nIn fact, it seems like 1 and 2 is a bit of a chicken and egg problem: in order for merchants to pay their employees in bitcoin, they have to receive enough of it from sales. But for everyday merchants to accept bitcoins, there must be enough people willing to spend them. Otherwise everyday transactions made with bitcoin is essentially a foreign currency transaction for both the customer and the merchant.": 1, 'From the day I first actually figured out what Bitcoin is and how it functions, it seemed self-evident that all of my Mexican friends who send money back home will not be handing over $100+ of their hard-earned money to Western Union every month for much longer.': 7, '>edit: in fact, what is the problem that a full circle bitcoin economy would solve?\n\nBitcoin solves the [problem of trust](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/36wxdl/two_approaches_to_conceptualizing_bitcoins_core/).': 2, 'So doesn\'t this make bitcoin a solution looking for a problem to solve?

None of those apply to the average joe in the rich democracies of the world, but they do apply to a lot of average joes in a lot of other places.': 9, '> Your Prius analogy would be closer to reality if you had to drive your SUV to pick up the Prius everytime you wanted to get anywhere.\n\nAh, ok, now I see what you\'re getting at.  So just to expand the analogy a little further, let\'s say that the Prius is parked 20 minutes away.  So if you\'re attempting to save money on gas, driving the SUV to pick it up won\'t make sense for most short trips (day-to-day spending), but it will make sense for longer trips (long-term value storage) and for special trips that require travel on certain Prius-only roads (e.g., "trips" on the Silk Road).  The network effect for Bitcoin getting larger is like the Prius getting closer and closer to the house, thereby making a greater number of trips with it feasible.  And complete, currency-level adoption is like the Prius getting so close to the house that it\'s parked right outside and you no longer need the SUV.\n\n>There\'s nothing inherent to bitcoin\'s design that makes it a good store of value; as historical prices will show, bitcoin is in fact prone to speculative price pressures. \n\nWell, maybe. That\'s the twenty trillion dollar question. I think that Bitcoin\'s design combined with its head start over other cryptos *might* make it an inherently good store of value.  That\'s not to say that I think Bitcoin won\'t be hugely volatile for the foreseeable future, making it an unreliable "store of value" over the short and medium term.  But if Bitcoin is successful we can expect its value to consistently increase over the *long term*.\n\n>Just because it eventually will have a fixed supply doesn\'t mean that prices will stabilize; holding supply constant still allows changes in price depending on demand.\n\nThe purchasing power of Bitcoin will never stabilize *completely* (not that we\'d want it to), but it seems obvious that greater adoption and a larger valuation should lead to less volatility.  So picking an extreme case to illustrate the point, if we imagine that Bitcoin has been wildly successful and become money worldwide such that billions of prices / salaries are denominated directly in Bitcoin, all those prices would provide a strong anchoring effect around Bitcoin\'s purchasing power.  Plus, in that scenario, there\'d obviously be a lot less uncertainty about how big Bitcoin would be in the future, making market consensus on its valuation much more stable.\n\n>Even if we go against the evidence and accept that bitcoin is a good store of value, what would be the mechanism through which it drives merchant adoption?\n\nIt seems pretty straightforward to me.  More people adopting Bitcoin as a store of value means more people (including merchants) wanting to hold Bitcoin.  Merchants who want to hold Bitcoin could just sell their goods and services for fiat and then buy Bitcoin with the fiat, but that introduces unnecessary friction.  Easier instead simply to offer to accept Bitcoin directly.\n\n>If that\'s the case, what incentive is there for me to spend it? The longer I hold my bitcoins, the more things I would be able to buy with it - why buy that yacht today if I can wait a few years and afford a jet (or more modestly, a slightly bigger yacht?)? \n\nThe incentive is that you can\'t eat bitcoins.  The only thing they\'re good for is purchasing other things.  That\'s the whole reason you wanted them in the first place.  So it\'s not a question of spending versus not spending. It\'s always a question of how to allocate your spending across time -- how much to spend today versus tomorrow versus next year.  You could just as easily ask why people ever spend fiat on consumption now when they know that they could put that money in an index fund or some other investment and grow its purchasing power an average of x% per year.  \n\n>You say in your other comment that "saving money as the functional equivalent of investing in the overall economy", but with bitcoin it isn\'t, by design. In a traditional banking economy you would be right because your bank now has more money with which to invest. But with bitcoin, you are taking money out of the system: reducing the supply of money and reducing the demand for goods and services in the bitcoin economy at that particular point in time.\n\nBut my point is that money isn\'t really what\'s invested. When you build a factory for example, what\'s really invested in its construction are scarce resources like labor, lumber, steel, etc.  Again, money isn\'t wealth.  It\'s an accounting system for facilitating the exchange of wealth.  Imagine a high school kid that mows 50 lawns over the summer to earn enough to buy a used car.  The "real" economic exchange there is 50 mowed lawns for 1 used car.  Money is just the medium of exchange that makes it possible for that trade to occur across multiple parties and across time.  (Barter would be a little trickier given the difficulty of finding a guy who a) has the car you want to buy; b) wants to sell it; and c) has 50 lawns that need mowing.) Now imagine that the kid decides not to immediately buy the used car but to instead wait a year.  Well, he has now given value for which he has yet to receive any kind of real satisfaction.  (The green pieces of paper in his wallet are obviously not what he really wants.) And that also means that someone else gets to enjoy the use of that car for another year.  The kid has thus effectively *loaned* the value of his services as represented by that car to society.  That\'s why it makes sense to me that money\'s purchasing power should increase over time.  Deflation is simply the "interest" on a kind of low-risk loan.': 1}, ('IamSatoshi - Trailer 2 featuring Andreas', 10): {}, ('Chain CEO: Nasdaq Partnership is No PR Stunt', 64): {}, ('I want to buy/sell BTC in my shop for cash, which app can help me achieve it?', 10): {'Ok somits mycellium or localbitcons to be used.  \n\nThing is i habe workers.

They should encourage, or at the very least be accommodating/inclusive of other Bitcoin Core candidates where there is at least some level of community discussion/support on the issue. I think taking a survey of nodes/mined blocks where there is a declaration of support for a version should be seen as a clear indication that the bitcoin.org site should  step back from supporting any one version, and at least offer visitors the option of running whichever candidates are currently being supported. \n\nBack in the day when the Satoshi client was the only wallet on the block, there was active effort to decentralise wallet development (fully supported by Gavin) for the exact same reasons that we are having issues with Bitcoin Core development now. Noone wanted a small clique of developers to be able to force the usage of any one piece of software and be given the sole power to control how users made transactions in case they screwed up, became co-opted or corrupted, or became victims of ossification or ego.

People have been rigging paper ballot systems since they were invented. At a small scale paper ballot elections can appear to be honest to most people\xe2\x80\x99s satisfaction only because everyone thinks they can observe the entire process.

It all comes down to the fact that magicians such as David Copperfield have perfected the art of illusion to the point that they can make cars appear from nowhere in front of a live audience. He can cause a dozen people to disappear from a raised platform with observers on all sides. We know this level of illusion is possible, and yet those who demand paper ballots like to pretend that no one would ever practice these techniques to make ballots disappear (or appear) from no where.\n\n>Whether or not you believe that there is a great conspiracy to rig paper elections, the fact remains that a provably honest online election is cheaper, more convenient, and therefore will allow more people to participate.

So if you\'re not checking, you run the risk that a miner or group of miners could fool you into accepting coins that dont exist.  But if a good portion of the economic weight of the network is checking, they will reject the fake coins you\'ve been cheated with, and so you will realise.  Eg if you spend money to a merchant who is checking, then the merchant will reject your coins.  Now the game-theory is that if this type of attack will very quickly be noticed and coins rejected, then the miner wont much get away with it, so he\'s less incentivised to try.\n\nIf no one is checking, miners can do this as much as they want. Let say for example Bitcoin gets really centralised so its running 8GB blocks (as Gavin proposed), or higher and they only fit in a big datacenter.  Now if no one has the bandwidth to verify them, we\'re back to trusting the assertions of a group of central people.  This is how the banking system works today, and we know how that works out.\n\nps You\'re right that it\'s not "no security" but it relies on a weaker assumption, that miners remain decentralised enough and honest enough to orphan off attacks.  If there were significant cheating going on 1 or even 2 confirmations would become unreliable while the honest nodes orphan the dishonest ones.': 5, 'rot13?': 0, 'I agree the block size is an easy concept to grasp on to, but I disagree that the pros and cons are very clear, unless you have a very over-simplified view of the pros and cons.

I certainly don\'t. I think they want Bitcoin to scale, but feel scaling through allowing a greater volume of on-chain transactions comes at too high a cost. I disagree with their evaluation.\n\nI also recognize and acknowledge that the Core developers have contributed much more to Bitcoin in general, and scaling in particular, than me. That doesn\'t mean that I will not express disagreement with them when I think they are wrong.\n\n> ignore the security properties of Bitcoin as irrelevant\n\nOr it could be that they have a different assessment of which trade-offs make Bitcoin more secure (e.g. high block size limit = greater adoption = larger economy = more public buy in making it more resistant to political attack + higher hashrate making it more resistant to >50% attack = greater security than making it easier for end users to run full nodes).\n\n> dont understand what O(n2) means for costs per transaction\n\nBitcoin\'s resource consumption is not O(n^2), as Mike Hearn explains: http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3a5f1v/mike_hearn_on_those_who_want_all_scaling_to_be/cs9ihol\n\n> or want everyone to run SPV and have no security (the system needs a good portion of the Bitcoin economy by BTC volume to be \nusing economically reliant full nodes)\n\nYou\'re making an assumption that your assessment is correct. You could be wrong. The system may work fine with most people using SPV nodes. SPV nodes are certainly less secure for a user than a full node, but it doesn\'t necessarily follow from that the block size limit should not be raised. There many other factors at play.\n\n> aren\'t aware of layer 2 (with offchain netting) already running\n\nI don\'t see where this assumption comes from. Just because someone wants a higher block size limit, doesn\'t mean they are not aware of layer 2 (offchain netting). I personally am very excited about layers built on top of the blockchain, like the Lightning Network, but don\'t want to put all of Bitcoin\'s scaling eggs in one basket, and also believe Bitcoin should stay true to its original vision and also (not mutually exclusive with overlay protocols like LN) allow millions of people to use the blockchain directly for txs, for the same reason that Bitcoin\'s coin supply should stay limited to 21 million: it\'s part of the original promise of Bitcoin and it diminishes the credibility of the currency when core design properties are changed.\n\n> dont know what lightning is nor the security properties it retains from Bitcoin.\n\nThis is just a presumption on your part. It doesn\'t follow that someone wanting a higher block size limit doesn\'t understand the LN and its security properties.\n': 0, "If it's not orange it's not bitcoin.": 3, "Indeed!\n\nAnd even ignore implementation decisions, there are real issues with relying on mempools for block contents; at the very least, they create a mild pressure to conform to others' expectations.

It\'s a bit more subtle.  The Relay Network basically uses fixed indices (eg. "Remember the 7th tx I told you about which we haven\'t used yet?").  That\'s really efficient, but assumes the RN tells you about every transaction.\n\nThe IBLT approach allows more fuzziness: I make one from the txs I know about, you make one from yours, and if they\'re close enough you can reconstruct the differences.  Gavin introduced them [last year](https://gist.github.com/gavinandresen/e20c3b5a1d4b97f79ac2) and they\'re pretty cool.\n\nBut we can\'t just use txids in the IBLT, since someone can create clashes by grinding out their own transactions which clashed (some part of) txids; a rational miner would drop both clashing txs in that case, which would allow someone to DoS your transactions.  So we need to generate a 48-bit ID which is where I was just using SHA256().  That works, but it\'d be nice for something better.\n\nAnd (my new hero sapiophile)[http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3bccp0/hashing_speed_sha256_vs_murmur3_thanks_rusty/csl5ter] pointed me at SipHash, which is *exactly* what this calls for!

Maybe /u/RustyReddit and others can chime in to make corrections.\n\nThe network needs to broadcast both transactions and blocks, but the blocks consist mostly of transactions, which results in the transactions being broadcast twice, which is inefficient.\n\nTo make this more efficient, you could broadcast a compressed version of the block, with the individual txs of many hundreds of bytes replaced by their 32 byte txid. Any node that receives such a block and already has the transactions can reconstruct the block from that information.\n\nRusty's method (which have have been introduced by /u/TheBlueMatt) adds some further optimisations, reducing the encoding to just two bytes per tx. This involves calculating additional hashes of the txs, and for that application it's not necessary to use expensive cryptographic hashes. Cheaper hashes like Murmur can be used instead.": 8, '> Well it\'s not a strawman exactly: Gavin proposed 8GB blocks (via automatic doubling from 8MB in a schedule). \n\nGavin has not suggested that 8 GB blocks will mean "Bitcoin gets really centralized" and that node running machines "only fit a big data center".
