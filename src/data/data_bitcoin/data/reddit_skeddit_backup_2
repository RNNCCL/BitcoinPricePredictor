How do you see that working?\n\nWell, I was thinking time locked fees on the feedback & reputation portion might deter the miner collusion without having to resort to the unspendable proof of burn. And honest miners would be more likely to participate to collect those fees and wouldn't mind waiting to collect.  You just make the lock time on the feedback fee transactions long enough so that it would deter reputation scams - 30 to 90 days?": 1, "I think *a* distributed DNM can be done with, say, pure Bitcoin+Tor+Namecoin. But again, look at my breakdown: Bitcoin only solves one part of the puzzle, payments. It has no way to store transaction histories, reputation scores are tricky (proof-of-burn is easy but how do you track who burned how much?), no way to send messages, no anonymity mechanisms...\n\nTo build a whole distributed DNM, you need additional puzzle pieces like i2p or a second blockchain for tracking all transaction history, reputation etc, and correspondence between buyer & seller (although that might be better done out of band in something like Bitmessage). So you can come up with a variety of designs: a specialized sidechain, use of Bitcoin but finessing history/reputation with 2-of-2 Nash exchange, a full altcoin, an Ethereum smart contract, not trying to solve some problems & hoping that works out, Tor/i2p for anonymity underneath the pseudonymous transactions etc. So if you didn't want the more complex alternatives, about the simplest possible distributed DNM would be (along the lines of P2Pox): Bitcoin with 2-of-2, Tor for anonymous connections, and Namecoin for storing pseudonyms/offerings; you connect with Tor to Namecoin to look up available offerings, then enter into a 2-of-2 Nash transaction (which simplifies matter a great deal, since you don't need Sybil-proof reputation/feedback because it's self-enforcing & the Nash equilibrium is honest exchanges).\n\n> Why did the authors pick ZeroCoin\n\nTransaction-level anonymity. With most of the other possible proposals, you would be able to see exactly how many transactions for how much where done when by each buyer and seller. This is problematic: it helps de-anonymization a lot and can hurt a seller a great deal when caught. Zero-knowledge proofs let a distributed DNM provide verifiable information about just the number of transactions and burnt amount but none of the other dangerous details.

The only thing banks are truly interested in is controlling the flow and exchange of money, and locking your value up so that they can charge fees and levy consequences upon you for using it in a way that is not in line with whatever government is on hand. The moment you [fall out of line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Choke_Point) you will be separated from your money. Banks, quite literally, are gates for your personal value to pass through and those gates are closely guarded. Why do you think they are largely forming "consortiums" such as R3 and Chain?

Bitcoin is fundamentally more powerful because it doesn\'t rely on any "consortium" membership to provide access or authentication. In bitcoin, you trust no one, and everyone is welcome to join. This is how the truly decentralized, open, peer to peer system works. *You don\'t need permission*. *You don\'t need a private firm like Chain to design your blockchain*. The bitcoin blockchain is the fundamental open, innovative trust layer that allows everything to occur now that you have this layer of trust established.

Among other things it was suggested to avoid keeping a list of bitcoin addresses for the cold wallet once charged to limit risks of contents being known, and also other risks (I don't remember who brought that up, but because a PC without a hardware random generator has limited entropy, generating hundreds of keys could in theory have some risk - I guess this should be somewhere on bitcointalk.org but I can't check right now since it's down).\n\n> Also back in 2011, Bitcoin had a much lower value, and the costs of implementing daily reconciliation were not something we could afford (in terms of man power, process, etc).
