The situation the code needed to address - invalid blocks - hadn\'t happened recently, because there\'s a strong incentive not to produce invalid blocks in the first place.

Hard forks are a lot cleaner, because the unupgraded miners quickly relegate themselves to a shorter chain that everybody else ignores, including SPV wallets.\n\nThis is quite a nice, clean way to upgrade (or not upgrade as the case may be, since 75% of mining power for XT is a very heavy lift), and the idea of trying to avoid it by pushing all the complexity and uncertainty down to merchants and wallets sounds quite heroically bonkers.": 1, "Possibly but they're already doing it at 1MB and it's done right it's (marginally) better for the network than not doing it, so I don't really see why you'd try to address this via the block size, which is neither necessary nor sufficient.\n\nRead Tier Nolan's posts on bitcointalk if you're interested in the actual mechanics and incentives involved here.": 1, 'Larger blocks exacerbate the reasons why they were doing it.': 1, '* During the BIP66 soft fork, there were times at which a *majority* of the mining power was put on the pre-BIP66 blockchain, despite the miners having advertised a vast majority in support of BIP66\xe2\x80\x94what an utter failure!\n\n    Therefore, the incentive to fix the problem couldn\'t have been because they were losing money, because they could have just abandoned the switch and kept going with the pre-BIP66 blockchain; the incentive had to be something more akin to a desire actually to see BIP66 succeed.\n\n* Regardless of whether the block-size limit must be altered, Bitcoin will never be on a firm foundation as long as there is the possibility of a hard&nbsp;fork; the only right thing to do is to let each system stand on its own (Bitcoin&nbsp;Core, Bitcoin&nbsp;XT, etc.), but create explicit paths between them with what\'s called a 2-way peg, so that users can transfer their coins from one system to the other.\n\n    This would be achieved by making Bitcoin&nbsp;XT a [sidechain](https://blockstream.com/sidechains.pdf) of Bitcoin&nbsp;Core; in that case, Bitcoin&nbsp;XT would *still* be an altcoin, but it would start with a brand new blockchain that is coupled to Bitcoin&nbsp;Core\'s blockchain (instead of just having a copy of Bitcoin&nbsp;Core\'s blockchain), and only Bitcoin&nbsp;Core would be allowed to create new coins.\n\n    As time goes by, if Bitcoin&nbsp;XT becomes the de&nbsp;facto "Bitcoin", it would be possible to pinch off Bitcoin&nbsp;XT, copy over the rest of Bitcoin&nbsp;Core\'s blockchain, and then have Bitcoin&nbsp;XT continue the minting process; even if this requires a hard fork, it would be much more trivial\xe2\x80\x94at least because the new system will have proved itself.\n\n    A hard fork is the same thing as creating an altcoin bootstrapped on an existing blockchain and then just telling everybody to switch to it; unless virtually everybody has already switched, triggering a hard fork when billions are at risk is insanity.': 1, '* > but the code to turn this into action and actually stop mining on them was missing or broken.\n\n    A huge number of miners don\'t even validate anything; they just hash blindly; that\'s *why* there was a problem. Do you understand this? Do you understand how frightening that is?\n\n    Why do you think they might do this?\n\n* Under a soft fork, the new rules are acceptable to the old miners, but the old rules are not acceptable to the new miners; the 2 camps stabilize around one history, and the minority miners are signaled of their situation by the orphaning. The problem here is that a higher probability of reorganization diminishes security (a confirmation isn\'t as strong as it used to be), and supposedly verifying nodes become SPV clients with respect to the new feature.\n\n    Under a hard fork, there are simply 2 different camps, and each eventually rejects the history of the other... *forever*. The only signal the minority camp receives is that it\'s taking a lot longer for confirmations to arrive, but that changes as the difficulty adjusts amogst the old miners; otherwise, they are still making block rewards, and fees; they are essentially oblivious.\n\n    But, that\'s not even the problem.\n\n    Because there are 2 histories, people will become very confused. SPV clients might be switched to the new blockchain, but merchants (who are more likely to use verifying nodes) might be on the old blockchain. Payments won\'t be received, because according to one history, they are invalid, or double spends might be made, because there are 2 histories at play.\n\n    *Fine*. Fine. People eventually figure out what\'s going on and "upgrade" their software to avoid *further* difficulties in interacting with the economic majority. Yet, at what loss? How much economic activity must be forgotten and written off in throwing out the old blockchain in favor of the new?\n\n    Again: Bitcoin will never be on a firm foundation as long as there is the possibility of a hard fork (and a soft fork is not much better); the only right thing to do is to let each system stand on its own (Bitcoin Core, Bitcoin XT, etc.), but create explicit paths between them with what\'s called a 2-way peg, so that users can transfer their coins from one system to the other.': 1, 'Dude, [I think we talked about this a while back](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3e8a4v/jeff_g_throwing_the_hammer_down_today_on_devlist/ctcnhsy).': 1, "The discussion of miners' validation incentives isn't right. Rational miners mine on an empty block without validating, but *only until they've had the chance to validate it*. They have an incentive to validate because if the network ultimately decides their block is invalid it'll be orphaned and they'll lose money, as they did in the BIP66 fork. Mining on headers for a small proportion of the interval isn't a problem - it actually makes the network slightly more secure against 51% attacks than letting more of your blocks get orphaned.\n\nThe problem with the BIP66 fork was that because their systems were buggy or incomplete, some miners weren't correctly invalidating blocks even after they'd had time to find them invalid. This behaviour cost them money, and they're properly incentivized to fix it.\n\nSo it's OK for validation to take a small but not insignificant proportion of the block interval, which was Satoshi's assumption, rather than needing to be effectively zero, which is the logic behind what Eric is saying. This is a good thing, because zero seconds to download and validate a block isn't a realistic goal. ": 0, "> A huge number of miners don't even validate anything; they just hash blindly hash; that's why there was a problem. Do you understand this? Do you understand how frightening that is?\n> \n> Why do you think they might do this?\n\nThey did it because their systems were broken. It's very, very bad if a large proportion of mining power has broken systems. However:\n\n1) They then got spanked by the consensus process for having broken systems. This is Satoshi's system of incentives working correctly.\n\n2) In the event that some miners don't fix their systems, perhaps because invalid blocks are unusual and it's not worth the development cost, the community could help them by providing some properly reviewed code for mining on empty blocks until a validation timeout. The way stock bitcoind currently works is less profitable if block propagation and validation takes more than zero seconds, which isn't a realistic goal at any block size, and as discussed above the network would actually be better secured if miners did what they're trying to do instead of what stock bitcoind currently does.\n\n> Under a soft fork, the new rules are acceptable to the old miners, but the old rules are not acceptable to the new miners; the 2 camps stabilize around one history, and the minority miners are signaled of their situation by the orphaning. The problem here is that a higher probability of reorganization diminishes security (a confirmation isn't as strong as it used to be), and supposedly verifying nodes become SPV clients with respect to the new feature.\n> \n> Under a hard fork, there are simply 2 different camps, and each eventually rejects the history of the other... forever. The only signal the minority camp receives is that it's taking a lot longer for confirmations to arrive, but that changes as the difficulty adjusts amogst the old miners; otherwise, they are still making block rewards, and fees; they are essentially oblivious.\n\nThat's not the only signal, because their nodes should be printing warnings, but yes, the fact that the network seems to have more-or-less stopped mining blocks should help tip people off that something is wrong.\n\n> But, that's not even the problem.\n> \n> Because there are 2 histories, people will become very confused. SPV clients might be switched to the new blockchain, but merchants (who are more likely to use verifying nodes) might be on the old blockchain. Payments won't be received, because according to one history, they are invalid, or double spends might be made, because there are 2 histories at play.\n\nPeople running unupgraded full nodes will become very confused, but nowadays running a full node is only something you do if you're either very technically interested or running a service behind it, and these are the people most able to find out about and handle an upgrade. Realistically nobody economically important is going to be on the old fork because they haven't heard about the new one, and nearly everybody needs to do nothing, because they're using SPV. Also the other great thing about this upgrade is that unlike BIP66, it's highly *controversial*, so it's much harder to fail to hear about it.\n\nIf this fork happens, it will be almost impossible to lose money accidentally because of it.": 1}, ('Crowd Factor (S1.Ep.1) with @MaxKeiser @SimonDixonTwitt @FactomProject and @ShapeShift_io', 1): {}, ('The mobile technology and money revolution in Africa.

The way those are brute-forced is that applications use dictionaries based on known books to guess these sentences, or sentences that are commonly used, such as "Sally really truly superly loves Jack". The article isn\'t about brainwallets, it is about INSECURE brainwallets. A quote: "The problem, says Castellucci, is that humans don\xe2\x80\x99t choose strong, random passphrases as well as they think they do.

These are words you might choose to describe the terrain left by California\xe2\x80\x99s ongoing drought. But they apply just as readily to the landscape for bank startups in America. In the 25 years before Lehman Brothers collapsed, new banks were licensed at an average rate of 164 per year. Since, the industry has been suffering a seriously arid spell. In 2011 no new banks were licensed, making it the first such year since at least 1934. When Primary Bank, based in New Hampshire, opens its doors on July 28th, it will be just the second lender in America to do so in five years. And it will be a welcome sight, given that small banks play a vital role in the economy.\n\nThe new bank began in the mind of Bill Greiner, a New Hampshire businessman who had grown frustrated with large banks. In early 2008, he applied for a commercial-property loan from Citizens Bank, then an American subsidiary of the embattled Royal Bank of Scotland. But despite a proven track record and a 50% downpayment, he was turned away. Baffled, he turned to Hampshire First Bank, a local lender. The relationship was happy, but short-lived: in 2012, the bank was purchased by another institution. Soon after, another local bank was acquired. As small banks disappeared from New Hampshire, Mr Greiner detected an opportunity and, joined by four other local businessmen, resolved to open his own.\nIn this section\n\n    Into the home stretch\n    Bargaining chips\n    The long march to normality\n    Bank free or die\n    Bypassing the voters\n    Much ado about trading\n    Destination unknown\n\nReprints\nRelated topics\n\n    New Hampshire\n    United States\n\nIn a state where residents assert their uncompromising independence with the slogan \xe2\x80\x9clive free or die\xe2\x80\x9d, it should be no surprise that Mr Greiner found considerable local support. Ownership of the bank is spread across more than 360 shareholders, most of whom are from New Hampshire. Each represents a potential customer or advocate. According to one investor, the bank has created a \xe2\x80\x9cbuzz in the air\xe2\x80\x9d.\n\nThe banking industry has been consolidating since the 1980s, when lawmakers loosened interstate banking restrictions. The number of commercial banks peaked at around 14,500 in 1984 before falling to 5,570 today (see chart). But even as the growing behemoths of the industry gobbled up their smaller brethren, new banks would always sprout up to help offset the decline.\n\nResearchers from the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City reckon there is a link between consolidation and startups. When large or out-of-state banks acquire smaller ones, service suffers, encouraging new banks to set up shop and fill the resulting void.\n\nToday there are lots of such voids. Since 2010 hundreds of small banks have been bought by large or distant rivals. But in the wake of the financial crisis, would-be bankers have faced a shaky economy and heightened scrutiny from nervous regulators. Low interest rates have also made life difficult for small banks. Such lenders usually concentrate on the traditional activities of gathering deposits and making loans, and so their profits are largely determined by the spread in interest rates between the one and the other. When rates are low, as they have been since 2010, this spread narrows and lending margins fall.\n\nThe resultant dearth of bank startups is troubling. Although small banks accounted for just 22% of all bank lending in America in 2014, they held 51% of all small-business loans and 77% of all agricultural loans, according to a study from Harvard University. That is partly because their loan officers can use their personal knowledge of a borrower and the local economy to evaluate credit risk.\n\nSuch local knowledge does not fit neatly with the impersonal lending procedures used by big banks, which are more geared towards large borrowers which have hard data, such as financial statements and credit ratings. Although new platforms\xe2\x80\x94such as peer-to-peer lenders\xe2\x80\x94are emerging, they are young and limited in size. In the meantime, America\xe2\x80\x99s small businesses hope that more will follow in Mr Greiner\xe2\x80\x99s footsteps.\n\nFrom the print edition: Finance and economics ': 1}, ('Another "stress test" just happened, it seems', 4): {'[deleted]': 0, '[removed]': 1, "chump change times 10 remains chump change. you can call it spam or an attack, this ain't. this is a fee market!
