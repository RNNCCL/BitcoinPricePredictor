We also would never publish unlabeled press release, nor would we write articles for payment.\n\nThat said, in cryptocurrency, if one were to limit advertising sales to only well known, trusted companies, then it would be almost impossible to sell advertising at all.  The most well known companies are focused on advertising OUTSIDE of the crypto world at this point, and even companies that were thought to be legitimate have turned out bad.  Mt.

Not at all.\n\nNow, I am much more skeptical of GAW today than I was even a month ago.  A month ago, I was more skeptical than I was the month before that.  However, we have been running ads for them since before the launch of their Hashlets, when they were mostly praised by the community.\n\nIf legitimate evidence of wrongdoing comes to light, we will certainly remove their ads.

Very early on they stated that purchasing a Hashlet wasn\'t actually purchasing mining power, but the "equivalent" of whatever amount of mining power.\n\nThe issue there is this:  How were they paying for this?  It doesn\'t actually have to be a Ponzi for them to cover the costs associated with doing that, if they have deep enough pockets.  They were, effectively, purchasing a fanatical fanbase, which could be worth paying for any longterm losses associated with Hashlet sales.\n\nOr, it truly could all be a scam.  I really don\'t know.  We aren\'t selling them MORE advertising space.  They just have prepaid impressions that have not been used up at this time, and we cannot legally remove them without proof that they are doing something truly illegal.\n\nAnother question is whether the sale of Hashlets was legal to begin with.  The Coinfire article about the SEC also is lacking in proof, but it does make sense.  I could see the SEC going after them for the Hashlets, as the fact that they were NOT actual mining power, but a "derivative" or some other sort of security, would put them directly in the SECs jurisdiction.  However, what was going on behind the scenes will determine if they had the legal ability to do that.\n\nI do completely agree with you about Paycoin being much bigger than most people seem to realize.

In fact there is direct evidence from the hashrates of LTC and other scrypt coins that there was never any significant hashing added at all. Not even remotely close to the numbers they claimed based on the amount of hashlets sold. It was a clear Ponzi scam from the start and people's money from the Ponzi has been rolled in to Paycoin and 'hashstakers'/prime controllers.\n\nTaking money from GAW is very much equivalent to someone taking money from Pirateat40 when he was running his Ponzi in 2012. Both have all the obvious signs of a Ponzi, yet they make grand claims that aren't directly falsifiable, just like Pirateat40 did. All evidence points to wrong doing, but without opening their books or visiting their facility no one is going to be able to prove 100% that they sold fake hashing. Even though the idea that they were actually selling lifetime hashing contracts that automatically upgrade hardware as time goes on was ridiculous. But in order for them to gain any trust from the community at all the onus is on them to prove their claims are genuine. Yet of course they've consistently lied and failed to do so.\n\nThe Paycoin lies and deceit are well documented, but it seems most people are missing the bigger picture here with the GAW scam.

First is they get embargo lists for countries and companies where money should not be sent to, and they are by law required to block those. This could include bitcoin companies if there are ongoing investigations because they are lacking money transamitting licenses which they need or something like this. This embargo list does not care about the topic of the transaction, just the receiver. Next thing is if they find signs of illegal activity. So they could block transactions where they suspect fraud or financing crimes. Next thing is violation of their terms for usage, like if your private bank account is showing operational patterns which indicate you are running a business on it, because they would then require you to open a corporate account. And the last thing is that they are free to choose whom they want to build a business relationship with. He told me that for example if PEGIDA, an association which is demonstrating against the "islamization" of Germany, wanted to open an account with them, they would refuse, because they are not compatible with the ethical principals of the bank. This would be blocking customers completely, not on a transaction basis. He clearly stated that at least the Sparkasse Hannover has no internal anti-bitcoin stance, and he even joked about how it might be possible to buy your coins there in a couple of years. They might be required to block transactions to certain bitcoin companies by law, though, and certain transactions could trigger their anti-fraud system.

Around the world, hundreds of thousands of specialised computers have been built to create (or \xe2\x80\x9cmine\xe2\x80\x9d) bitcoins and, in the process, validate transactions and protect the system. How does bitcoin mining work?\n\nThe aim of bitcoin\xe2\x80\x94as envisaged by Satoshi Nakamoto, its elusive creator\xe2\x80\x94is to provide a way to exchange tokens of value online without having to rely on centralised intermediaries, such as banks. Instead the necessary record-keeping is decentralised into a \xe2\x80\x9cblockchain\xe2\x80\x9d, an ever-expanding ledger that holds the transaction history of all bitcoins in circulation, and lives on the thousands of machines on the bitcoin network. But if there is no central authority, who decides which transactions are valid and should be added to the blockchain? And how is it possible to ensure that the system cannot be gamed, for example by spending the same bitcoin twice? The answer is mining.\n\nEvery ten minutes or so mining computers collect a few hundred pending bitcoin transactions (a \xe2\x80\x9cblock\xe2\x80\x9d) and turn them into a mathematical puzzle. The first miner to find the solution announces it to others on the network. The other miners then check whether the sender of the funds has the right to spend the money, and whether the solution to the puzzle is correct. If enough of them grant their approval, the block is cryptographically added to the ledger and the miners move on to the next set of transactions (hence the term \xe2\x80\x9cblockchain\xe2\x80\x9d). The miner who found the solution gets 25 bitcoins as a reward, but only after another 99 blocks have been added to the ledger. All this gives miners an incentive to participate in the system and validate transactions. Forcing miners to solve puzzles in order to add to the ledger provides protection: to double-spend a bitcoin, digital bank-robbers would need to rewrite the blockchain, and to do that they would have to control more than half of the network\xe2\x80\x99s puzzle-solving capacity. Such a \xe2\x80\x9c51% attack\xe2\x80\x9d would be prohibitively expensive: bitcoin miners now have 13,000 times more combined number-crunching power than the world\xe2\x80\x99s 500 biggest supercomputers.\n\nClever though it is, the system has weaknesses. One is rapid consolidation. Most mining power today is provided by \xe2\x80\x9cpools\xe2\x80\x9d, big groups of miners who combine their computing power to increase the chance of winning a reward. As mining pools have got bigger, it no longer seems inconceivable that one of them might amass enough capacity to mount a 51% attack. Indeed, in June 2014 one pool, GHash.IO, had the bitcoin community running scared by briefly touching that level before some users voluntarily switched to other pools. As the bitcoin price continues to fall, consolidation could become more of a problem: some miners are giving up because the rewards of mining no longer cover the costs. Some worry that mining will become concentrated in a few countries where electricity is cheap, such as China, allowing a hostile government to seize control of bitcoin. Others predict that mining will end up as a monopoly\xe2\x80\x94the exact opposite of the decentralised system that Mr Nakamoto set out to create.': 2, 'Paid access, can you copy and paste the article into this thread?': 3}, ('What is the difference between a public key and a bitcoin address?', 3): {'An address is a [double-hash](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function) of the public key plus a [checksum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checksum).\n\nMore details: https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Technical_background_of_Bitcoin_addresses': 5, 'The relationship is nearly this:\n\nBitcoin Address ~= Base58Encode(00 & Ripemd160(Sha-256(Public Key)) & CheckSum)': 2, 'Compressed key is a while nother address': 1, 'a bitcoin address is the doogie-howser-md hash of the public key': 1, 'I think the address is a compressed key to make it shorter.

A market will still be created even without the block size limit because you want your transaction to be confirmed and its up to a miner to confirm it.   simple as that': 0, "Blocks don't have to fill up to create a market.  The other limited resource at play is bandwidth.  Because of this miners have to balance the odds of an orphaned block due to propagation time of larger blocks.  Each mimer can set their own fee structure that may cause your transaction to be delayed.  You then have to pay the highest fee to ensure your transaction is a priority for all miners. \rThis is true until bloomfilters are used to transmit new blocks.  Then the incentives change completely because propagation time becomes O(1).   odds are they will have a complex fee structures to ensure they can pay for operation costs.": 2, "I agree with Gavin here.\n\nTrying to tune the blocksize to balance miner profitability with economic activity sounds like the closest thing to introducing central bank policy.  Miners going out of business and dumping coins? Shrink the block size. Economic activity suffering from too high fees? Increase the blocksize. I can just imagine people speculating on the next blocksize adjustment as to whether it will make coffee purchases feasible again and spur demand for coins.  It all sounds very un-bitcoin-like.\n\nThe only sane decentralized solution is to have an unlimited block size and let the free market regulate it.  That's what I think l Gavin is going for, with the upper limit just being a DoS prevention like the original 1MB cap was for.\n\nBTW, I use bitcoin to buy coffee all the time. If I couldn't use it for that, I'd stop being such a fan. No I don't want to be forced off chain for those payments. What kind of ridiculous currency is so expensive to move that you have to rely on third party ledgers to account for it? Sounds like those giant stone currencies.
