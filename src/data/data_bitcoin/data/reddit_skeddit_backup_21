It sounded like I was talking to the same person I\xe2\x80\x99d worked with way back when. That convinced me to get on an airplane.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nInteresting. Looking at Wright's blog, he's absolutely NOT like Satoshi. Particularly [this](http://www.drcraigwright.net/consistency-distribution-transactions/) article...\n\nThis article is written by a person who really doesn't understand what he's talking about, but is desperate to appear very smart.

He doesn't even know programming basics.\n\n> The timestamp function utilized in the block structure is an open-source IEC 61850 \xe2\x80\x98uint32_t\xe2\x80\x99 implementation [5].

It differs from the \xe2\x80\x98uint64_t\xe2\x80\x99 bit value because \xe2\x80\x98uint32_t\xe2\x80\x99 is accurate to the second whereas \xe2\x80\x98uint64_t\xe2\x80\x99 is accurate to the millisecond. Because this is an unsigned integer, the bitcoin network supports twice the total number of seconds as the standard Unix time format.\n\nWTF.

As the chief scientist of the Bitcoin Foundation, his opinion counts: Andresen is among the earliest programmers for the cryptocurrency, and likely the one who has corresponded more than anyone with Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin\xe2\x80\x99s pseudonymous, long-lost inventor.\n> \n> Today, Andresen fully believes that Wright is Nakamoto. Now he\xe2\x80\x99ll have to convince the rest of the world, because he\xe2\x80\x99s among the only people to have seen what he claims is the best evidence in Wright\xe2\x80\x99s favor.\n> \n> In an interview with WIRED on Monday following flurry of media reports stating that Wright now publicly claims he created Bitcoin, Andresen described in detail a private meeting he had with Wright in London. And he explains why he left that meeting convinced that Wright is the same Nakamoto who unveiled Bitcoin in 2009 and emailed extensively with him in 2010 and 2011. Andresen says his belief is unwavering, despite a bizarre and highly unconvincing blog post Wright published Monday offering the flimsiest evidence that he invented the cryptocurrency\xe2\x80\x94evidence of a very different sort from what Andresen says Wright revealed to him.\n> \n> \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m still convinced he\xe2\x80\x99s Satoshi despite the really weird proof he\xe2\x80\x99s put in his blog post,\xe2\x80\x9d says Andresen. He stands by a statement he published on his website this morning: \xe2\x80\x9cI believe Craig Steven Wright is the person who invented Bitcoin.\xe2\x80\x9d\n>\n> **The Private \xe2\x80\x98Proof\xe2\x80\x99**\n> \n> As Andresen tells it, a firm representing Wright contacted him in March and invited him to London for a private, in-person demonstration designed to prove Wright created Bitcoin. Andresen understandably expressed reluctance. WIRED and Gizmodo had named Wright in December as a Satoshi Nakamoto candidate based on leaked emails, accounting documents and transcripts. But then gaps in Wright\xe2\x80\x99s story appeared following those reports\xe2\x80\x94including signs he had backdated evidence and misrepresented academic credentials\xe2\x80\x94it seemed Wright was likely pulling an elaborate hoax or con.\n> \n> But Wright followed up with a series of emails that piqued Andresen\xe2\x80\x99s interest. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is a person who knows an awful lot about Bitcoin and an awful lot about early Bitcoin stuff,\xe2\x80\x9d Andresen says. \xe2\x80\x9cThe email conversations I had [with him] sounded like Satoshi to me. It sounded like I was talking to the same person I\xe2\x80\x99d worked with way back when. That convinced me to get on an airplane.\xe2\x80\x9d\n> \n> On the morning of April 7, Andresen took a red-eye to London and proceeded directly to a hotel in the Covent Garden district. He met Wright and two associates in a conference room there that afternoon and, Andresen says, Wright performed the cryptographic feat that erased his remaining doubts.\n> \n> Cryptographers have suggested at least two ways the creator of Bitcoin could prove himself: Nakamoto could move some of the earliest Bitcoins, which are known to belong to him and have never been spent in their seven-year existence; or he could use the same cryptographic \xe2\x80\x9cprivate keys\xe2\x80\x9d that would allow those coins\xe2\x80\x99 owner to spend them to instead \xe2\x80\x9csign\xe2\x80\x9d a message\xe2\x80\x94transforming the message\xe2\x80\x99s data in a way that proves he or she possesses keys that only Nakamoto would have.\n> \n> Wright, Andresen says, offered to perform the second test, signing a message of Andresen\xe2\x80\x99s choosing with a key from the first \xe2\x80\x9cblock\xe2\x80\x9d of 50 coins ever claimed by a Bitcoin miner, in this case Nakamoto himself. (He also performed a similar test for Jon Matonis, a former board member of the Bitcoin Foundation, and a reporter for the Economist, the magazine says, using both the first and ninth Bitcoin blocks.) Andresen says he demanded that the signature be checked on a completely new, clean computer. \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t trust them not to monkey with the hardware,\xe2\x80\x9d says Andresen.\n> \n> Andresen says an administrative assistant working with Wright left to buy a computer from a nearby store, and returned with what Andresen describes as a Windows laptop in a \xe2\x80\x9cfactory-sealed\xe2\x80\x9d box. They installed the Bitcoin software Electrum on that machine. For their test, Andresen chose the message \xe2\x80\x9cGavin\xe2\x80\x99s favorite number is eleven.\xe2\x80\x9d Wright added his initials, \xe2\x80\x9cCSW,\xe2\x80\x9d and signed the message on his own computer. Then he put the signed message on a USB stick belonging to Andresen and they transferred it to the new laptop, where Andresen checked the signature.\n> \n> At first, the Electrum software\xe2\x80\x99s verification of the signature mysteriously failed. But then Andresen noticed that they\xe2\x80\x99d accidentally left off Wright\xe2\x80\x99s initials from the message they were testing, and checked again: The signature was valid.\n> \n> \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s certainly possible I was bamboozled,\xe2\x80\x9d Andresen says. \xe2\x80\x9cI could spin stories of how they hacked the hotel Wi-fi so that the insecure connection gave us a bad version of the software. But that just seems incredibly unlikely. It seems the simpler explanation is that this person is Satoshi.\xe2\x80\x9d\n>\n> **The Problem With the Public Proof**\n> \n> Under other circumstances, the Bitcoin community could almost be convinced by Andresen\xe2\x80\x99s account, too. But in contrast to Andresen\xe2\x80\x99s private demonstration, the evidence that Wright publicly offered to support his claim almost immediately collapsed. \xe2\x80\x9cThe procedure that\xe2\x80\x99s supposed to prove Dr. Wright is Satoshi is aggressively, almost-but-not-quite maliciously resistant to actual validation,\xe2\x80\x9d wrote security researcher Dan Kaminsky early Monday. After more analysis, Kaminsky updated that assessment: \xe2\x80\x9cOK, yes, this is intentional scammery.\xe2\x80\x9d\n> \n> On a newly-created website, Wright published a blog post featuring what appeared to be a cryptographically signed statement from the writer Jean-Paul Sartre. It seemed intended to show, as in Andresen\xe2\x80\x99s demonstration, that Wright possessed one of Nakamoto\xe2\x80\x99s private keys. But in fact, Kaminsky and other coders discovered within hours that the signed message wasn\xe2\x80\x99t even the Sartre text, but instead transaction data signed by Nakamoto in 2009 and easily accessed on the public Bitcoin blockchain. \xe2\x80\x9cWright\xe2\x80\x99s post is flimflam and hokum which stands up to a few minutes of cursory scrutiny,\xe2\x80\x9d wrote programmer Patrick McKenzie, who published an analysis of Wright\xe2\x80\x99s message on Github. \xe2\x80\x9c[It] demonstrates a competent sysadmin\xe2\x80\x99s level of familiarity with cryptographic tools, but ultimately demonstrates no non-public information about Satoshi.\xe2\x80\x9d\n> \n> Even Kaminsky and McKenzie say they can\xe2\x80\x99t explain the discrepancy between their analysis and Andresen\xe2\x80\x99s story. \xe2\x80\x9cBut for the endorsement of core developer Gavin Andresen, I would assume that Wright used amateur magician tactics to distract non-technical or non-expert staff of the BBC and the Economist during a stage-managed demonstration,\xe2\x80\x9d McKenzie writes. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m mystified as to how this got past Andresen.\xe2\x80\x9d\n>\n> **The Disconnect**\n> \n> Andresen, for his part, remains equally mystified by Wright\xe2\x80\x99s highly dubious public evidence. The contradiction between the two accounts is so stark that at first some in the Bitcoin community believed that Andresen\xe2\x80\x99s blog, where he\xe2\x80\x99s vouched for Wright, must have been hacked. He says Wright and his staff wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t let him leave the hotel meeting room with his own much stronger evidence, for fear that Andresen would leak it before Wright was ready to come forward. But Andresen says he can\xe2\x80\x99t understand why Wright didn\xe2\x80\x99t release that information publicly now. He hopes Wright still might.\n> \n> Andresen\xe2\x80\x99s only attempt at an explanation for Wright\xe2\x80\x99s bizarre behavior, he says, is an ambivalence about definitively revealing himself after so many years in hiding. \xe2\x80\x9cI think the most likely explanation is that \xe2\x80\xa6 he really doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to take on the mantle of being the inventor of Bitcoin,\xe2\x80\x9d says Andresen, who notes that his own credibility is at stake, too. \xe2\x80\x9cMaybe he wants things to be really weird and unclear, which would be bad for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\n> \n> That uncertainty, Andresen says, seemed to be evident in Wright\xe2\x80\x99s manner at the time of their demonstration. Andresen describes Wright as seeming \xe2\x80\x9csad\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9coverwhelmed\xe2\x80\x9d by the decision to come forward. \xe2\x80\x9cHis voice was breaking. He was visibly emotional,\xe2\x80\x9d Andresen says. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s either a fantastic actor who knows an awful lot about cryptography, or it actually was emotionally hard for him to go through with this.\xe2\x80\x9d': 5, 'Better yet, move a couple genesis block coins.': 1, "Let's see how Gavin could have been fooled:\n\n* The laptop has been tampered and then resealed.\n* The laptop was new but was interchanged with another one when Gavin looked in another direction (physical magic trick)\n* The laptop was new but was hacked from the USB stick\n* or through the wifi (the laptop is new so windows is not up to date with the latest upgrades)\n* The electrum software downloaded is not genuine (Man in the middle attack through the wifi)\n\nOther ideas ?": 4, "1) raising investment in his business ventures by using satoshis bitcoin as collateral to improve the company valuation even though he won't need to prove ownership.\n2) credibility for his company being used to do blockchain research \n3) kudos in creating the new technology enables leverage in financial institutions.
