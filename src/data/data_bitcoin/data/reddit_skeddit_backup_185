The "off blockchain" thing seems to directly cause a collection of weird misunderstandings: like that they require third party trust, or that their transactions are necessarily not Bitcoin transactions.\n\nWith a thoughtful and at least semi-technical audience I like to explain cut-through to open people\'s eyes to the simplest form of what real scalability looks like: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=281848.0\n\nI hope I made it clear in my post that I\'m not expecting bidirectional payment channels or the like to magically save the day. The role they play in that plan is preparation for the future.\n\nAnd yes, we\'ve all been working on many things-- see for example the _7x_ connecttip performance that\'s already done; and explaining this stuff is really an art. Bitcoin has grown so fast that the community of interested people has vastly outpaced our capacity for teaching.  How can I do a really good job of explaining what a great impact a 7x connecttip improvement is when I first need to explain what connecttip is.. and why performance matters for security and so on.. all while actually doing the work and making sure that it works?   ... not to mention that we\'re also busy on other improvements outside of capacity techniques to protect and grow Bitcoin into the future (e.g. consider my work on Confidential Transactions).\n\nThis is all a good problem to have, and we\'re working on communicating better-- some of it you\'re already seeing like the weekly dev meeting summaries and even the above post.\n\n>  so we flock to simpler, easy-to-explain stuff like BIP 101\n\nThe funny thing is that 101 is simple to _explain_ but the consequences aren\'t simply at all... and the implementation isn\'t either.  The bitpay "bigblocks" BIP101 backport patch is 3422 lines long; the segwittness patch at it\'s current state is 2589 lines long.   Segwit is less mature and all of the components, eventually it may end up bigger ... but something can be 100x more complex to explain to someone who isn\'t a Bitcoin developer while being similar in complexity to implement or even less complex in its full ramifications.\n\nSome proposals sound simple when you don\'t have much context, but complex when you do. While other things sound complex or pointless when you have no context, but simpler when you do. And teaching that context takes a lot of effort which competes with actually maintaining the system.\n\n': 28, "All in all, seems to be even less than a x2 capacity increase:\n\nhttp://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2015-December/011869.html\n\nFor how many month will it be 'the solution' in 2016, the year of the Great Halvening?

Combined with other recent work we\'re now getting ConnectTip performance 7x higher in 0.12 than in prior versions. This has been a long time coming, and without its anticipation and earlier work such as headers-first I probably would have been arguing for a block size decrease last year. This improvement in the state of the art for widely available production Bitcoin software sets a stage for some capacity increases while still catching up on our decentralization deficit. This shifts the bottlenecks off of CPU and more strongly onto propagation latency and bandwidth.\n\nAnd \n\n> There has been some considerable activity brewing around more efficient block relay. There is a collection of proposals, some stemming from a p2pool-inspired informal sketch of mine and some independently invented, called "weak blocks", "thin blocks" or "soft blocks". These proposals build on top of efficient relay techniques (like the relay network protocol or IBLT) and move virtually all the transmission time of a block to before the block is found, eliminating size from the orphan race calculation. \n\nI\'d posit his strong opinion was based upon the instantaneous relay of blocks larger than 1mb,  which as shown by jtoomin in his presentation,  has huge delays currently (latency wise).': 3, 'Could/would priority be given to segwit transactions to encourage wallets and users to use it?': 2, "I really want clarification on this point as well.

What we've done with Monero, for instance, is to acknowledge that we don't know who runs nodes, and so for the next few years (at least) we're going to have a code freeze every 6 months for a hard fork that happens 6 months after that freeze, even if the only change we're making is to bump the block version number.\n\nBUT Monero is also a tiny, currently irrelevant cryptocurrency with only a small userbase and a minuscule market cap, so we can afford to do that. Bitcoin has to tread more carefully, and if regular hard forks aren't ingrained in the system then you need to find clever ways of maintaining participants for as long as possible.": 5, 'Another way to understand the increased capacity is looking at absolute transaction throughput.  Bitcoin\'s maximal throughput is slightly over 7 tps at 224 bytes per tx.  With SegWit, the theoretical maximum moves closer to 10.5 tps, which is a 50% improvement.  Neither of those numbers hold under practical usage patterns though, so something like 8 tps in actual usage might be all we can expect to get from SegWit alone.  That matches what nullc is saying.  I just want to make sure people didn\'t think "4 MB blocks" and  think it would mean 4x as many tps as we currently have.  No.  The absolute limit would be about 10.5 tps.\nThanks to aj for walking me through some of this!': 12, "They can just mine off the header or another miners work; already today.. and many do.\n\nAt least in segwitness as it is no, there isn't a protocol message that would be useful for what you're describing there.

We have a currency which works, has solid economic principles (fixed supply), currently decentralised, etc...

This gives Bitcoin a certain level "hardness" which is perhaps only exceeded by gold in the currencies realm.': 3, 'I guess they were probably in-the-works but devs were too busy to clearly communicate to us about them, and re-assure is that they would work.\n\nAlso maybe they didn\'t think they\'d get rolled out (because a hard fork would be needed) - until this new "versionbits" thing came along (which seems like it could allow more stuff to be rolled out smoothly via soft forks).\n\nNot an ideal situation - but I\'m tired of attributing things to malice on the part of the devs, when it could more easily be explained by lack of time / energy.\n\nI\'m hoping that communication will improve in the future.\n\nBut if I had to choose, I prefer devs who are great at programming and maybe not-so-great at communicating, versus the opposite (devs who are great at communicating and not-so-great at programming).\n\nSomeday hopefully we can have both - but if we have to pick only one, I think we all agree that the priority for devs should be programming over communicating.\n\nI\'ve been a vocal critic of many of the devs in the past - but not today. This is great stuff they\'re releasing, and we should give them credit where credit is due.\n\nThis is also a fascinating learning experience today, where we can see who is clinging to old animosities towards devs, versus who is swayed by the new stuff being released.\n\nAs I said - I have been highly critical of Core / Blockstream devs in the past - due to their prioritization of stuff like RBF, and due to their view of the blockchain as a settlement layer for stuff like LN.\n\nBut I saw the video and read the transcript of Pieter Wuille\'s presentation on Segregated Witness and Fraud Proofs, and I was instantly convinced. I turned on a dime, and I\'m not ashamed to look like a fickle politician blowing in the wind today. New information became available, and I changed my tune accordingly.\n\nI don\'t know, I guess it was just on a level where I "got" most of it.

This is more aimed for small businesses and startups looking into accepting it but I'm glad people here enjoyed.": 3, '/r/titlegore': 1, '*Text for those that prefer it:*\n\nIt has been a year and a half since we enabled customers to buy with bitcoin on our website. I felt it would be useful to write an overview of how it compares to our other payment methods and our general experiences / insight. I first got into bitcoin at the end of 2012 and my previous startup was in the industry. As a retailer, we can see the direct impact price has over how likely someone will spend their bitcoins and its benefits in terms of payment processing fees charged by financial institutions.\n\n##Adding Bitcoin as a Payment Option - Is it worth it?\n\nThe short answer is yes! There are many reasons to accept bitcoin as a payment option. First off, additional revenue. **We have received $7,402 worth of bitcoin orders since launch**. A large majority of that is likely from purchases that we would not have received if we hadn\'t added it. From a financial perspective, it makes a lot of sense.\n\nThe bitcoin community is filled with very loyal and supportive people. They love seeing websites accept BTC on your store and their online communities (most notably /r/bitcoin) allows open discussion about purchases made with bitcoin and the stores that accept them. That community is currently followed by over 175,000 subscribers and is a worthy marketing channel. The biggest factor to increasing bitcoin sales is interacting and catering to that community and making their experience amazing. I personally am a part of it so it was easy but in practice it should be simple for newcomers as well.\n\n*Pro-tip: We don\'t recommend spamming your links on their boards. The best way to market to redditors is to 1. introduce the fact that you\'re accepting bitcoin, 2. give them a customer experience worth telling friends about. Email your bitcoin customers just to say hi and discuss it. We take a different approach in general with our customer/community relations and feel getting personal is the best method for success.*\n\n*You can really standout and gain fans by making products specifically for the bitcoin community. We licensed and sell [a funny bitcoin shirt](http://thatshirtwascash.com/products/bitcoin-wizard) based on a popular ad campaign on reddit.*\n\nWe receive our largest amount of bitcoin sales during [Bitcoin Black Friday](http://www.bitcoinblackfriday), which is an event catered towards special bitcoin discounts. Signing up to BTC Black Friday is free and simple as well. Marketing-wise, it has been a common practice to announce you accept bitcoin as a standalone PR agenda as well. News websites are more likely to pick the story up (although we personally don\'t interact with the media ourselves, I know we could leverage it if we wanted to). Overstock has done a specifically remarkable job at this.\n\nLastly, the fees are at least half (or zero if you accept it directly without a third-party service) of standard payment processors. We have [Coinbase](http://www.coinbase.com) integrated into our website and **our fees are only ~1%**. It gets a little more complicated when tax season comes, so additional expenses may occur if you liquidate the bitcoin into fiat cash. In the US, selling your bitcoin sales under 1 year are taxed at your regular income bracket which can dramatically increase the cost. We personally HODL (common joke on the term "holding" your bitcoin) onto the bitcoin from sales, so we haven\'t incurred these tax implications.\n\n##Bitcoin Processing Fees Compared to Paypal\n\nI was shocked and rather pissed off earlier this year after completing a full financial analysis of our revenue and expenses. I learned that Paypal was charging us ~5%... 5% of all payments made through their damned service... in fees for the privilege to use them. I realized that having a merchant account didn\'t lower your fees compared to being a regular member. You have to dig into the settings and click one button to turn on the lowered fee prices. After doing so, we are now charged ~2.6% in sales fees.\n\nThis is pretty standard for regular payment processing but I felt the way they handle this is a scam. The fact that having a merchant account doesn\'t automatically give you merchant fees is ridiculous. If you use Paypal for sales, dig into the settings and make sure this is turned on.\n\n##Bitcoin as a Percent of Sales\n\nBitcoin isn\'t going to make a huge impact on your business unless you leverage it to gain widespread media attention. For us, it has still been worth it for the marketing opportunities and ability to service a group of people we identify ourselves with and love.\n\nBitcoin only totals about half a percent of our total sales this year, but every sale counts. We also are in the low-margin high-volume industry of apparel so it makes sense that our total sales would be on the low end. Businesses that cater to a higher-end customer and commodities like rare metals will likely see a larger increase.\n\nWe have noticed a dramatic difference in the number of sales from bitcoin based on bitcoin\'s current price. When the price is "undervalued" or people are down on their initial investment, they spend less. When the price is up, especially during price surges, **we see bitcoin sales almost daily**.\n\n##Conclusion\n\nOverall, bitcoin in 2015 is a great value proposition. **We saw bitcoin sales grow from 2014 to 2015 by 20.4%** and I anticipate that to only increase in the future as the payment method becomes more trusted and widespread. Personally, I am bullish on bitcoin\'s price going above $1,000 again, so the bitcoin we have received from orders hopefully will continue to increase in value as well. We are up on our position overall. Shirts sold during 2015 have sometimes doubled in their value as the price fluctuates.\n\nWe will continue to accept bitcoin as one of our three payment methods and can\'t wait to see what happens in the future.': 3, '/r/shitpost\n\nNeither of us are wrong...': 2}, ('[Help] Should I have the police involved?', 1): {'Did you use LBC escrow?

Offer (free and paid) marketing campaigns through BitPay, Coinbase and other industry members.\n\n*2. Have a completely separate portal built to accommodate **merchants** and only **merchants**.  Dont group merchants with noobs and kids wanting to learn about Bitcoin. Dont group merchants with radical you-tubers or those wearing stupid looking outfits and the fuck-this / fuck-that anti-establishment diatribes. Show merchants that Bitcoin is big business, show mechants that Bitcoin has adult participation and the Bitcoin Foundation takes Bitcoin seriously. Show merchants that inclusion in the Bitcoin community is valuable and the Bitcoin Foundation will make certain they have the support they need.\n\n*3. On the new merchant web portal provide an interactive assessment/evaluation of the merchant from zero knowledge to advanced and let them start at any level they feel comfortable.  Have specific videos, done/sanctioned by the BF, discussing things like cold wallets, hot wallets, local bitcoins, buying, selling, trading, security, multisig, 2FA, etc. Everything they need is there.  And have a FAQ specific to Merchants needs.\n\n*4 Have quarterly video conferences with merchants and key BF members and executive to update on consumer sentiment and community events.\n\n*5. Incentivize downstream vendors of Member Merchants to become involved in Bitcoin.   \n\n*6. Abolish the lifetime membership fee - that is a poor business model.  Add a maintenance fee to grandfathered memberships and give them a cool Tshirt printed by a company that accepts bitcoin and designed by a bitcoin accepting artist. Have a contest for design which creates buzz.  Put advertising of Merchants and industry members on Tshirts. Give one - newly designed Tshirt, showing the year-  every year to every member and merchant/industry member. People want something tangible for their dues. Tshirts are cool..  Let them give the tshirt away to a friend or neighbor if they have too many, THAT creates awareness.\n\n*7. Increase annual membership fees for individuals to $100.00/ and give them a Tshirt evey year.\n\n*8. Run the BF like a business.\n\n*9.

It's just the last 4 bytes, and it's only in effect if the sequence numbers for all the inputs is less than the maximum.  There's some specifics about it to look up, but once you understand how transactions work, it's nothing to add in locktimes.": 1, "I think it's best to assume that I have no idea how the low level stuff works. Conceptually I knew all of what you said, but I don't want to assume knowledge if it will make me misunderstand it.\n\nFor context, if you'd like, [this](http://gappleto97.github.io/Senior-Project/) is the project I'd be using it in. I'm certainly trying to emulate the bitcoinj/LN model, but beyond that I only have knowledge of it at a high level.": 1, "Specifically a micropayment channel. I understand some of how it works, and I'm willing to do quite a bit of legwork, but I don't know where the best starting point is.": 1, 'What do you mean "make a transaction"?  What specifically are you trying to do?  pycoin has all of the code necessary to make or verify a transaction, but you\'d still have to know how Bitcoin scripting works.  There\'s also Electrum pybitcointools and a bunch of other libraries that allow you to just put in address info and they\'ll use rpc or bitcoin-cli or just a web explorer and get the necessary info and make the transaction, so you don\'t need to know how Bitcoin scripting works.  There\'s a ton of libraries out there for pretty much anything you need to do.  What exactly are you looking for?': 2, "So there's two general ways micropayments usually work.  The first one is where the user deposits a large quantity to a 3rd party service and that service does any micropayments and deductions on its own database, off the blockchain, and then the users cash out at some later time.  Think about how changetip works -- it handles all those transactions internally and then actual Bitcoin transactions only happen when you deposit or withdraw.  And so it can do 1 satoshi payments without a fee, because it's only updating its own internal records.\n\nThe second way is basically what the lightning network is doing, and likely is what you want to do, which is using multisig + timelocked transactions back and forth to create a micropayments platform.  Here's an example:  you have wifi that you're willing to rent for 100 satoshis every 15 seconds.  My client connects to your router and your router and my client make a 2-of-2 multisig address that both of us put in say 0.1 bitcoins.  (Your router has say 1 bitcoin sitting in it in order to do this so 10 people can connect at any given time, and there's some protocol that automates this.)\n\nNow that address has 0.2 Bitcoins, and you construct and sign a transaction that pays me back 0.1 and you 0.1 but is time-locked for a day or two -- some amount of time that is clearly more than long enough for me to use your internet, and then some.  That's backup for me in case you just go offline, I can get my money back.\n\nThen we start.  I write a Bitcoin transaction that pays your router 0.10000100 and pays me 0.09999900 Bitcoins, and this transaction has no locktime and can be signed and cashed by you at any time.  I cannot broadcast it because I don't have your signature.  But I can send it to you and *you* can broadcast it after you sign it.  Then 15 seconds later, I make a new transaction that double-spends that one but pays you 0.10000200 and pays me 0.09999800.  I know you won't broadcast/cash-in any of these, because in 15 seconds I'm going to make a new one that pays you even more.\n\nAll of this is happening off the blockchain -- I'm just making and signing transactions over and over, but they're not being broadcast to the network.  Eventually I finish my internet activities and tell you I'm finished.  So now you sign and broadcast whatever the most recent transaction I sent you was, because that was for the highest amount, and you want to broadcast it before the time-lock on that initial refund you sent me passes, so you can get paid the highest amount possible.  If you let the time lock pass, in a day or two, then I will broadcast that refund that pays us both 0.1, whereas if you broadcast your latest transaction, you get say 0.10000800 and I get 0.09999200.  So the threat of me cashing in that refund forces you to settle-up within a reasonable time.  (And all of these transactions use the same inputs so only one of them can be mined, and the others will become invalid when that happens.)\n\nThat's basically what a micropayment channel is.  It's just a novel system of using multisig addresses + nLockTime + incentive to allow for off-chain micropayments between two parties.  The only situation that's difficult to manage is the initial funding of 0.1 by both of us -- who goes first?  Maybe you're just a jerk and I fund the address and you don't, and even though you don't get anything (because it's a multisig address, so you can't get the money without my signature), maybe you're content to just watch me lose money.\n\nThere's a couple ways around that.  For example, the time lock and initial deposit may only cover two or three hours, so we each only risk a few bucks in the funding stage, and then we settle-up and start over every few hours.\n\nSo to make a micropayments channel, what you need to know is how multisig and nlocktime work.  Which is reasonably complex -- you definitely need to know the ins and outs of Bitcoin transactions and how they work.  As far as I know, there's not yet a good library for auto-implementing that type of system, so you'd have to set it up yourself.\n\nHow much do you know about Bitcoin transactions and how multisig works?

The really clever parts in segwitness are new though-- the ability to apply it to bitcoin as a soft-fork was a recently insight by Luke-Jr, and the addition of fraud proofs (which I've been working on and advancing for years)-- make this a _much_ more powerful tool.\n\nBut I'll be sure to cite that BoolBerry did something like this already; both for credit's sake and it's an additional proof point.": 12, "Back when the first discussions picked up for a blocksize hardfork picked up, I proposed that we do a super uncontroversial hardfork as a way to gain experience and flex the muscles.\n\nI suggested that we reclaim the bits of the block header that are forced-zero by difficulty-- there is always at least 32 bits of them. Miners could use it for additional initial compression run nonce, which they've asked for... and if be some of it could later be soft-forked to have other meaning.\n\nThis suggestion was received in a really unwelcome way by those advocating a hardfork; because it wouldn't be compatible with existing lite clients without upgrading them.  I'd still like to do it, and think it would be good for the network (both in experience and the deliverable)-- but I see no point in pushing for it when it's just seen as an effort to sabotage the race to unlimited block size.": 7, "According to the author of 101, those additional changes are required to make 101 safe (I agree but they are also far from sufficient...). 102 by itself opens up terrible DOS attacks.\n\n> You'll notice that about half of those 786 added lines of code are unit tests. \n\nThe segwitness numbers I gave include around 600 lines of new tests and updates to existing tests.\n\n": 1, "> BIP102 by itself doubles the severity of currently possible DoS attacks\n\nNo, without segwitness sighash time is quadratic in the size of the whole transaction, which can be a whole block in size.

BBR prunes the blockchain on the entire network while AEON prunes on each node individually (and only if pruning is enabled). This means that new nodes can come online faster with BBR, but those new nodes are unable to independently verify the entire blockchain. It is possible to download an unpruned BBR blockchain from a web site to independently verify it, but in that case the amount of data downloaded would be the same as AEON. It also means that every BBR node is able to serve the chain to new users but in AEON this function falls to nodes that are unpruned, also known as "archive nodes" (or alternately via a trusted bootstrap file).': 3, "This seems very reasonable.

BIP65 is a simple soft-fork that enables OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY; a much demanded feature that enable fancy escrow transactions of many kinds.  The proposal is over a year old, it was scheduled for deployment in Core for months. It was deployed a month ago in Core. It is active on the network and being used by 75% of hashpower as we speak.  ... But XT, which is mostly a copy of core, and which Core provided backports of BIP65 apply basically cleanly to has, as I type this, still not managed a release with it in it.  And that\'s OK, you can continue to use non-CLTV nodes on the network, because the change is a soft-fork.  And I am _not_ saying all this to make fun of XT: maintaining software is hard and the tight synchronization of hard-forks makes them harder and riskier to deploy, and causes them to undermine the freedom to go and maintain your own implementation of the software, because your development cycle ends up having to be tightly slaved to the network.\n\nFor Segwitness a hardfork implementation would be virtually identical to the soft-fork one in any case-- as all it would do is change the commitment location:  Changing the base transaction syntax is the only additional thing that might be done in a HF but doing that would completely and deeply thousands of applications all at once-- because virtually everything that interacts with Bitcoin reimplements transaction serialization. To avoid having to effectively shut off the network during switchover applications would need to support both forms-- a tall test when most software in the bitcoin space hardly even has tests (beyond "talks to the bitcoin network" -- how many services have you even seen with testnet versions?), and all it would gain just save a couple bytes.\n': 17, '> This is a terrible misrepresentation.

If you do that, then deleting all of the unit tests would make a patch simpler and therefore better. Also, I was not referring to BIP101 as a single-line patch. I meant something like BIP102, which could be a single line. Obviously, SegWit and BIP101 are not equivalent, because SegWit is a one-time increase to 1.75 MB capacity whereas BIP101 changes continuously.\n\nMany of the changes to the bigblocks tree are not related to BIP101. The actual blocksize patch in BIP101 is this: \n\nhttps://github.com/bitpay/bitcoin/commit/e6c024b1f00aa15820dc1eb67036f58493236a84\n\nYou\'ll notice that about half of those 786 added lines of code are unit tests. That makes about 350 lines of code. A lot of the other lines are things like adding validation cost metrics and limits to the block size. 786 lines of code is better for a block size change than 1 line of code, if the extra 785 lines make it safer.

Existing full nodes already do not validate signatures in the far past-- with SW they could also skip transferring them.  It also reduces the amount of data sent to lite clients (making higher privacy lite clients less resource intensive).\n\nAnd the fraud proof benefit can give lite clients, with lite bandwidth consumption, full node like security under the strong assumption that they aren't partitioned from the honest network.\n\nPlus, the additional capacity can't be used to flood the UTXO set.\n\nBut as you note: On the tip of the chain for miners and full nodes, nothing is changed by segregated witness; though they're improved by other things in the capacity plan I laid out.": 23, '> Really, sticking SegWit data into the coinbase is a kludge anyway.\n\nAnd yet every prior additional commitment proposal has done that; and you objected to none of them.\n\n> and I think should result in significantly smaller fraud proofs\n\nThe overhead is something like 448 bytes plus a couple kilobytes for the coinbase transaction-- the whole thing ends up being one extra transaction larger (instead of being 2 transactions in size, it\'s three, for example); this hardly seems worth taking additional cost, risk, and disruption for.  But a later hardfork could also just move things around to optimize their layout; without undertaking any complex novel changes or requiring complex software replumbing.\n\n> In addition, there\'s the fact that doing segwit as a soft fork turns fully-validating nodes that don\'t upgrade in time into non-validating nodes\n\nOnly with respect to segwitness transactions which they already would not create themselves or have paid to them, or pay attention to until confirmed.\n\n> I think it is preferable to do it as a hard fork\n\nIf BIP65 were a XT style hard fork, XT would be dead now.

Non-upgraded nodes will see new SW-transactions as free money, but if the old nodes just stick to the types of transactions they can handle it shouldn't be a problem.\n\nWallet software will have to be upgraded to use the new SW-transactions in order for block space to be freed up.\n\nThis is my understanding of it.

Putting SegWit data into a subtree off the main block's merkle root is technically a better place for the data anyway, and I think should result in significantly smaller fraud proofs. If you put segwit on the coinbase, your fraud proofs need the merkle path to the coinbase (about 10 hashes, or 320 bytes), plus the coinbase transaction (another 500 bytes or so), plus the path in the witness merkle tree to the signature data (another 10 hashes), and finally the signature data (about 200 bytes). If you put segwit where it belongs, in a branch of the main tree, you just need the path to the signature data and the signature data itself (320 + 200 bytes). /u/nullc, please correct me if I'm wrong on any of this, as I was a little distracted during sipa's presentation.\n\nIn addition, there's the fact that doing segwit as a soft fork turns fully-validating nodes that don't upgrade in time into non-validating nodes. This opens them up to double-spend attacks and violates existing services' security models. I think it is preferable to do it as a hard fork, where nodes that do not upgrade will simply be cut off from the rest of the network and will not receive new data. I think it is better to receive no data than it is to receive potentially erroneous data.\n\nDoing SegWit as a soft fork is a kludge. It really works better as a hard fork.
