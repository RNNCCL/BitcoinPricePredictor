Bitcoin has this same need, to pay the miners that validate transactions and stamp blocks with POW.  Bitcoin does this both by rewarding transaction fees and block rewards *through the protocol itself*.  \n\nBitcoin uses no trusted party to make these payments to miners.

So its generally accepted that a token that has a value is required in order to battle spam attacks.\n\n2nd unless you have a native token then there isn\'t a way to reward nodes in the system in a decentralized manor. If there were a pot of bitcoins used for a reward than a central entity would have to hold that pot and dole out the rewards leaving the system vulnerable to censorship and gate keepers.\n\n3rd the point above I made about fighting bloat remains. You mentioned there are "plenty of mechanisms to avoid bloat". Despite your statement the normal way to "fight bloat" is to move transactions off chain. However when you do this the records are no longer publicly audible as "off chain" means a private database. When you do this you are once again in the position of trusting a central entity controlling that off chain data base. One of the core values of Factom is the ability to secure a record to the blockchain without bloating it, but at the same time keeping all the records publicly audit able via the Factom chains and anchoring those chains with just a single transaction into the bitcoin blockchain every 10 minutes.': 2, "That's why it is open source.\n\nOf course, if you want to use Bitcoin and build a centralized solution, you can get rid of most of our code.  Making Factom a decentralized system (and thus requiring the token) is what makes Factom complex.": 2, "YES!

Preventing people from being scammed is not trolling.\n\nActually, Factom\'s tokens are not "guaranteed to be worthless".  Quite the opposite.  The tokens will reflect the value of the Factom Protocol.  Conclusions without analysis, i.e. statements like "Selling a token that will be guaranteed to be worthless is a scam.", that is trolling.\n\n> Your token is not backed by anything. You admit this. If it isn\'t, what is it backed by? How much does one Factoid buy me of your service? Oh wait, there\'s no way to set a fixed price.\n\nThe fact that Factom\'s tokens will not have a fixed value is not the same as saying that they are backed by nothing;  the tokens are backed by the value of the protocol.\n\nBitcoin doesn\'t have a stable value, nor is it backed by anything.  But I doubt you would say it is a scam.\n\n> The cockamamie scheme to put AppCoins into this so you could raise money at the expense of rubes is the problem, no the idea. The protocol may help solve problems. I\'ll wait for the version that doesn\'t try to scam the public using AppCoins.\n\nWe have a white paper and consensus paper that goes into great depth into the design, and how it works.  If you could point to actual alternatives to our design decisions...\n\nOh wait.  You decided that being decentralized isn\'t a good enough decision.  That having a mechanism to choke down span isn\'t important.

He has invested his own money and effort in all of these projects.  Maidsafe, Storj, Ethereum, La\'Zooz ... these are all very ambitious projects seeking to solve very fundamental problems.   \n\nAs is Factom.\n\nThe claim that David is a con artist is laughable.   David is a good and honest person, as anyone who knows him can attest.   That said, he has chosen to dive into some of the most ambitious and crypto centric projects in the space.  His investment and promotion of those projects may open him up to criticism should any of them fail, as most startups do.  This is not in any way proof of an individual being "a straight out con artist."\n\nThe reader will have to decide if insults and conclusions lacking any analysis as you have presented are worth while, or if a reasoned discussion of what little one can identify as a concern in your writings carries more weight.\n\nI hope you can actually learn enough about Factom to make specific observations and propose specific alternatives to our design.
