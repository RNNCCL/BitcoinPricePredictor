The spatial distribution of information is a power law (of exponent between 1 and 2 -- my guess) implying that, roughly, the most informative 5% of the document has 50% of the information. Furthermore, this 5% is clustered in space. Let us assume that consequently a 5% is redacted.\n\n> We now need to take into account the discretization due to the division in chunks. Let us assume 100 chunks. Redacted parts are more granular and closer to the continuous limit, but clustered, therefore there will be typically not more than 10 chunks containing redacted parts (the attacker could also play with document margins and redacted-block boundaries to further "optimize" this).\n\n> Now, if 25 chunks are uniformly random selected, there is ~5% probability of not hitting a fake one. This means that 20 parallel encryptions will suffice half of the time, or 100 parallel encryptions for a ~90% attack success rate. This looks certainly doable.': 1, "That's a good point. I don't see how there could be a way around that.": 2, 'Disappointing it is being marketed solely as a black market for working outside the law when there are so many implications and use cases for legal transactions to occur on a market like this.\n\nPerhaps a fork "WhiteLeaks" or "OpenShare"?\n\n': 8, 'None.

Just pass the transaction from device to device, signing until it's ready. SSSS requires all the pieces end up on a single device for computation of private key.": 2, 'Good explanation. I would add to that, for clarification, that multisig is explicit on the blockchain (it is a type of allowable transaction), while SSSS is not.': 2, 'As I described in the other reply, it\'s all just a script, and alt-coins presumably also use scripts, so they theoretically can implement this.  They might not have turned on this functionality though -- for example, their software might say "any script that\'s not a normal address is automatically invalid", and that\'s just part of how that coin works.  But there is no technical barrier to them implementing it.\n\nThey can also decide to accept new and different scripts.  Namecoin, the first alt coin, added a script that says "I\'ve included some data which is to be assigned to this address, and it is only valid if the same data isn\'t already assigned to some other addresses, but if that\'s the case, then this address owns that data for the next 30,000 blocks".  That\'s a script that runs in Namecoin, and it\'s how Namecoin can create a distributed DNS and identity system, because its protocol allows you to publish data that "belongs" to you and only you.  And the first implementation was using that data for DNS resolution -- matching domain names to IP addresses.': 3, 'No, multisig and SSSS are entirely different things.\n\nSSSS is a method of splitting up any type of small amount of data.  A private key can be used, or a password to a file.  Whatever tiny data it is, SSSS allows you to break it into pieces m-of-n of which must be together in order to reconstruct that data.\n\nMultisig comes from how Bitcoin works.  Bitcoin addresses aren\'t actually addresses, they are scripts, mini programs that execute.\n\nWhen a Bitcoin is first created, it is "mined" and either comes from the fees or the block reward.  From that point forward, it is simply passed around, moving from one transaction to another.  So when you get a bitcoin, what\'s actually happening is that a "transaction" is recorded on the blockchain that says the following:\n\n"I own address A, and you can see from tx number X that address A received some bitcoins in an output.  I am spending those bitcoins, using them as inputs for this transaction, and sending them along to this other address, the output of this transaction, which can later be used as an input for a future transaction.  I am proving I am the owner of address A by signing this message with my private key, and you can use my public key and this message and the signature to verify that."\n\nThat statement is represented in a specific way, and one of the features of Bitcoin is that "addresses" aren\'t actually addresses.  As I said above, they are scripts.  So those inputs and outputs that have bitcoins attached to them aren\'t really addresses.\n\nWhen an "address" receives money, the money is actually paid to a script, and anybody who can execute the script can spend that money.  Under normal circumstances, the script basically says the following:\n\n"Check that the signature is valid for this transaction and the given public key.  If it\'s not, the tx is invalid.  If it is, and thus you have proven that you own the private key associated with the public key, and that you approve of this transaction, then go to the next step...  Ok, next step is that we hash the public key that went with the signature.  (A hash is a one-way function that can\'t be reversed.  So if I give you data, you can easily compute the hash, but if I just give you the hash, you can\'t go backwards to figure out the input data.)  If the public key does not generate the correct hash, make the tx invalid.  If it does, then we\'re all good and the tx is valid, since we\'ve proved we own the address, we\'ve proved it\'s the *right* address, and we\'ve signed the tx."\n\nSo that\'s a "normal" bitcoin transaction, and when you send money to a normal address, you\'re really just sending money to the statement "whoever can prove they own the key that hashes to this hash can spend the money".  So whoever can satisfy that statement can then spend the money.\n\nA multisig address is just a different statement.  So for example, for a 2-of-3 multisig address, you are sending money to the statement "I\'ve listed three keys here, and if a future transaction spending this money is signed by at least two of them, then allow it."\n\nBut many other statements can and have been used.  [There is an "address"](https://blockchain.info/address/3MaB7QVq3k4pQx3BhsvEADgzQonLSBwMdj) that corresponds to the statement "True", aka the script always passes and anybody can spend its money.\n\nI could also send money to the statement "write a math operation that equals 5" and you could spend it with the script "2+2+1".\n\nNormal addresses are merely the statement "check the signature and verify that the key provided with the signature matches this hash", but there\'s a lot of other possible statements.  They are written in [Bitcoin\'s "Script" language](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Script) which is just a simple and incomplete programming language.\n\nMultisig addresses are a subset of what are called "pay to script hash" (aka P2SH) addresses.  They are called that because in order to save space, rather than writing out a long script, the convention now is to write the script "evaluate the script used when trying to spend this money, and make sure that it verifies and also that it matches the following hash: [hash goes here]".  In bitcoin, that whole statement is assigned to be the byte "05" followed by the hash, which is always 20 bytes long.  And when you convert that 21-byte string that beings with 05 into base58, it always begins with a 3, which is why multisig addresses and all P2SH addresses begin with a 3.  They all say "evaluate the spending script and make sure it matches this hash", and then the spending transaction is the one that actually includes the long script.  So you only have to write it once, in the spending tx, instead of twice (paying script AND spending script), so it saves a little space.  And normal bitcoin addresses begin with a 1 which is assigned to the statement "There is only one key, so check the public key and signature are correct, and make sure they match this hash".\n\nBut again, you could write out any statement yourself, and you don\'t even have to use P2SH addresses to store it, (that\'s just the nice thing to do).  You could just write it all out in the receiving transaction to begin with.  It would still be a valid tx, but block explorer websites like blockchain.info wouldn\'t have a good standard way of displaying it, so they\'d just say "unable to decode".\n\nSo, to summarize, SSSS splits up data, while a multisig address is a special type of script.  They are entirely different things that serve different purposes.': 3, "Almost...\nI believe the key difference is that with multi-sig each party doesn't need to reveal their private key but instead sign the transaction.\n\nWith SSSS you need to provide the N pieces of the puzzle  to a trusted party to decode the content (i.e. the private key).  This means with SSSS you couldn't use the private key again since the other party now knows the solution where as multisig would still be secure.\n\n": 2, "On top of that, when exposing your part of the secret, there's no way to know how the 'trusted' third party is going to use it. He could sign any transaction he wants. \n\nWith multi sig, you can check where the funds are going. ": 2, 'Nice explanation. May I know whether multisig is built based on ssss? Which cryptographic asymetric key exchange is used? With normal ECDSA we have one private and one public key so this multi sig should probably use a different algorithm.': 2, '> BTW do miners accept these kinds of not standard looking transactions?\n\nSome do, some don\'t.  There\'s three types of validity of tx\'s:  valid and standard, valid but not standard, and not valid.\n\nMost miners will mine only valid and standard transactions, however if they receive a block that contains a valid but not standard tx, they will still accept that block and mine on top of it.  Maybe 10-15 percent of miners (pulled that number out of my ass) actively mine valid but non-standard transactions.  The Eligius pool, for example, manually altered its rules for what it considers standard, so it mines *some* non-standard transactions but not all, because it\'s going based on its own rules, and since its blocks are still *valid*, everybody else will accept them when Eligius mines a block that includes them.\n\nCurrently, only normal bitcoin addresses, 2-of-3 and 3-of-3 multisig addresses, and OP_RETURN data of 40 bytes or less, and all outputs greater than 546 satoshis, and there is a 0.00001 fee per kilobyte size of the tx -- only tx\'s that meet that criteria are considered "standard" by the majority of miners.  So any transaction with different scripts other than normal addresses and multisig addresses will be not standard and take much longer to get in a block.  I suspect that if you include a larger than normal fee, there\'s probably a good chunk of miners with settings set to mine non-standard tx\'s if they have a good fee -- although I don\'t know that for sure, I\'m just guessing.\n\nAs for memory, well that depends on the size of the script.  "1+1+1+1+1=5" is not standard and is much smaller than the script which is standard "Here\'s 3 public keys listed in their entirety, get two signatures".': 2}, ('Today I went to buy "The Age of Cryptocurrency" from Barnes & Noble store.

The new exchange lends credibility to the cryptocurrency, which has lost about 60 percent of its value since the beginning of last June amid fraud, hacking and theft cases that plagued the currency\'s stability.\n\nThe exchange\'s launch is noteworthy, but so is the distinction between bitcoin\'s value and its regulatory and business acceptance. Though bitcoin might fail should its users lose faith in it, the concept of cryptocurrencies is here to stay. The endorsement of these digital currencies by financial regulators and merchants is a move toward the broader recognition and legitimacy of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, once favored by those who wanted a currency unregulated by any government. \n\nCryptocurrencies can be thought of as a technology with the power to have far-reaching effects on the global economy. In some ways the individual bitcoin is similar to gold in that it is hard-wired to appreciate in value. However, unlike gold or any other currency, it can be divided almost endlessly into small parts. Bitcoin was among the first cryptocurrencies to gain serious interest and backing, largely due to the efforts of Satoshi Nakamoto, a pseudonym for the person or group responsible for the "bitcoin protocol." Prior to bitcoin, electronic currencies required a third party, such as PayPal, to determine if one party still owned the money or had previously spent it, thus transferring ownership to someone else. The bitcoin protocol solved this problem by creating a publicly viewable global ledger, known as the "blockchain," that shows the sequential transactions of all accounts using the cryptocurrency.\n\nBitcoins are bought and sold online and are generally stored in a digital wallet. The currency is not controlled by a central bank but is instead managed by an online community. Members with powerful computers are encouraged to maintain the transactional register by "verifying the blockchain" \xe2\x80\x94 solving complex mathematical equations and adding another block of transactions to the existing chain. This process is known as mining, because the verifier is rewarded with new bitcoins. New bitcoins will not be created after there are 21 million in circulation, which is projected to happen in 2140.\n\nCryptocurrencies are still far from becoming a powerful financial tool. Yet, cryptocurrencies and the overarching bitcoin protocol will remain in some shape and fashion. The movement on the regulatory front is an important precedent that is being set for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. It remains to be seen if these currencies can grow out of their niche market, but much like the Internet or file sharing, governments cannot exercise complete control. The United States and United Kingdom appear to recognize this fact and are trying to do as much as possible to bring bitcoin and other similar currencies into the traditional financial market.\n': 2, 'I am more interested in the fact that stratfor is representing itself in this space.\nhttp://www.zerohedge.com/news/anonymous-explains-why-27-million-stratfor-emails-were-hacked?page=1\n"\n\nStratfor was not breached in order to obtain customer credit card numbers, which the hackers in question could not have expected to be as easily obtainable as they were.

": 3, '> Is the only thing stopping the re-program of bitcoin public outcry?\n\nWell, in theory it\'s already been done a thousand times, we just never care to even run those versions of Bitcoin. I can re-compile my version of Bitcoin right now changing all the constants and start running it, but nobody will be in the same blockchain/world as me.\n\nI am going to emphasize the difference here between Bitcoin and your traditional bank. When you sign up with a bank they give you a legal contract. That legal contract can be broken, but it\'s on you and the Bank to detect when it\'s been broken and enforce the contract. If the contract changes in motion it\'s also the duty of you or the Bank to nullify or update the contract legally. With Bitcoin your contract is the protocol, and if it changes the party that has changed the contract will have disassociated themselves.\n\n\n> If it does get \'re-programmed\', will it exist as a different alt coin instead?\n\nWhen you say "re-programmed" we typically discuss a few different scenarios:\n\n* The worst is called the "hard fork" and happens if the community and everyone drastically disagree on how something should happen. If/when this occurs it means that the community must quickly side with one of the forks. The network will keep operating, but this would happen if there were two very popular versions of Bitcoin miners that don\'t agree on the protocol rules. Anyone can keep running whatever version they want, but the version with the most mining adoption will basically win a hard fork.\n\n* The second worse is called a "soft fork" and has happened before. It basically means that things don\'t agree in small ways but overall they do agree. It\'s usually caused by a small bug.\n\n* Lastly we can add *new* things to the protocol or extend it in ways that won\'t break the existing rules. \n\nThe first two examples are just people not agreeing, either intentionally or unintentionally. The last one is more interesting in this discussion in my opinion.\n\nFor example, how could one change the 21 million coins to a higher number? One could change all of the mathematics behind Bitcoin, but it would cause a hard fork to actually change the equations. A better question to answer is why do coins stop being printed in the first place? What is actually happening?\n\nWhen a coin is "printed" it\'s because a block was mined. Blocks give you X, where X is currently 25 BTC. This value halves every 4 years. Eventually it will be 0.00000001 and dividing it by two will yield a number lower than the lowest number in Bitcoin.\n\nSo right now the mathematical precision is keeping Bitcoin from "having more coins" unless we hard fork and basically start all over. In theory the mining can actually continue forever, and we just keep printing smaller and smaller amounts of coins. From an inflation standpoint it\'s pretty brilliant, because it\'s well understood you cannot print yourself out of inflation.\n\n> And where does the code live? I heard one can look at, examine and even fork the code?
