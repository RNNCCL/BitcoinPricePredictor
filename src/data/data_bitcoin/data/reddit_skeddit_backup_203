The lock can be indefinite, there is no need to periodically refresh the channel it can stay up indefinitely so long as there is some use to that (eg if recirculation is working out).  When you want to close the channel you publish a transaction which starts the relative timelock, then there is a time-window to reclaim.  Relative lock-time is interesting because it reduces the amount of reload transactions and also enables shorter time-locks because they dont imply regular tear down and re-establishment of the channel.": 3, "I can vouch for Rusty's warm attitude.

In fact, everybody I've talked to about Lightning has been quite nice and eager to see more people get involved. Hopefully this will keep up as developers continue to contemplate how to get this sucker off the ground.\n\nThere's just one small caveat for developers.

': 1, "> What are the main concerns associated with adopting and developing the lightning network\n\nI'll answer as an implementer...\n\nMy main concerns are that it needs careful engineering.  Protocol decisions tend to be sticky, so you try to get them right and extensible the first time (look at IPv4).  Privacy and centralization are big issues: bitcoin still sends traffic in the clear, which is bad, but much worse if you are mainly sending your own transactions as with many lightning users. If you don't make the protocol as trustless as possible, you have to rely on reputation systems, which are inherently centralizing. You really want to be able to connect to 5 random nodes and it Just Works.\n\nTraffic analysis is also an issue: micropayments are potentially even more sensitive than large transactions for tracking (say I automatically tip every website I visit).  Bandaiding on solutions afterwards (particularly if they make things less efficient) may be impossible.\n\nThen there's the routing problem: how do you get payments across millions of nodes to their destination? Unlike IP, addresses aren't nicely grouped, and you don't want to reveal information by asking, not have every node know the entire routing graph (including the charge associated with each hop).\n\nPerhaps as a saving grace, the bitcoin network isn't ready yet either. But there's a chicken and egg problem there too, that it's hard to justify changes for something which didn't have lots of users. Fortunately, all the requirements are generally Good Things For Bitcoin, so they will happen, it just takes time.\n\nMy aim is to have some solid, tested, beta-quality interoperable implementations, with a complete spec for others to follow, by the time the Bitcoin network is ready.\n\nOf course, there are other things that are important, too.  The versionbits BIP, block propagation, and bitcoin-dev moderation have taken up real time from my schedule, but they need doing. As has my family, and biological requirements like sleep.\n\n> , and how are people currently trying to address them?\n\nOne day at a time. I'm currently implementing a daemon which will speak the complete proposed protocol between nodes. That will no doubt lead to refinements, and we'll iterate again. And brilliant new ideas come up on the mailing list with impressive frequency, which each need to be analyzed, prioritized and digested.\n\nI may take on an intern next year, but that's always a didn't proposition in terms of short-term progress!\n\nHope that clarifies (sorry if this is a bit unclear; I'm sitting on my phone answering this on a day off...)\n\nPS.

And then added staff in hope nobody will notice that I was right again. Same as last time you assumed you can just use your name to put me in my place.": -1, 'Concerns I have:\n\n* It\'s not implemented yet -- that limits adoption pretty seriously :)\n* Working out how to scale route discovery could be really hard.\n* Running a lightning node without also running a full (but pruned) bitcoin node might be hard, which would limit adoption assuming you don\'t want to run a bitcoin node on your phone...\n* Tracking payments by R value might be too effective, making the onion layer pointless and meaning governments and well-resourced criminals can figure out everything you buy and sell. But it looks like that\'s solvable given a new OP_ECC_MUL or similar.\n* Lightning wallets are "hot" by nature; phones are pretty insecure -- running a lightning wallet on your phone might mean you get pickpocketed a lot. This might not actually be worse than existing phone wallets though...\n* Keeping the lightning network "balanced" might be hard -- if someone receives more than they spend on the blockchain, that\'s fine, they just get more UTXO entries; if they do the same thing in lightning, their channels fill up and they can\'t receive any more money; and this affects routing nodes as well as merchants. Not really a showstopper, even in the worst case, though\n* Without third-party malleability fixes and OP_CSV, managing channels/funds will be pretty tedious. Fingers crossed for BIP68/112/113, and a segregated witness soft-fork soon.\n\nThings I\'m not concerned about (though YMMV):\n\n* Miners not getting any money. Lightning nodes will have to pay them whatever it takes to close channels anyway; if they price out other uses of bitcoin, they\'ll only do that by paying miners enough anyway.\n* Lightning will make blockchain fees super high, like $20 per transaction. I don\'t think opening a lightning channel can realistically cost more than monthly bank account fees, so $2-$5 per transaction would seem like an upper limit to me before lightning is too expensive compared to banks/paypal/visa/etc.\n* Funds are "locked up" in payment channels, making them inaccessible. You can withdraw from a channel in three ways -- agreeing with the other party to cash out to the blockchain, which in the normal case should always be easy; unilaterally closing it, which will cost extra in fees and a delay of up to a few days (assuming OP_CSV) before you can access the funds; or spending the funds to yourself over the lightning network. I expect  those to be "good enough".\n* Lightning is only good for micropayments, not big payments, like buying a house or a car or getting a salary or paying rent. (a) Okay, so what? Just use the blockchain directly for big payments, micropayments are interesting enough! (b) If you can pay someone a cent cheaply and easily, then just do that a million times, and you\'re starting to talk real money. Computers are good at doing the same thing repeatedly, so maybe good at micropayments means good at big payments.\n* Blockstream/Visa/rich people will control everything in lightning: that might be possible, depending on how the "payment routing" system ends up working; but even if it does, it\'s just a matter of replacing the routing system with one that doesn\'t give the bad people control, and setting up your own lightning network, presumably with blackjack and hookers. Lightning seems like it\'ll be pretty interoperable, so doing your own thing should be pretty effective.\n* Coding is hard. Yeah, it is; and a working small-scale demo on testnet is months away at best IMO, let alone something you want to use with real money. But that\'s okay, good engineering takes time.\n': 6, "Well there's like a 50 page white paper, and I think Joseph & Rusty and others seem pretty confident it can work, and there are 3 independent implementations at various stages of parts of it.

But the basic mechanism seems to clearly work.\n\nThere are some more *interesting* questions which might make it work even better.

Therefore, I for my part could never agree with such a statement (neither this way nor the other way round!). I prefer to try to be as "unbiased" as possible. \n\n***Example***: Assuming (just for the sake of example) I am of the opinion that at present (Nov. 2015) a block size limit of 4 MB is ideal.

Naturally, when there are technical issues at play, developers are generally better positioned to discuss the technical aspects of such changes so it generally makes sense to carefully consider their input as they will typically have a greater insight into the issues at play versus an average random user, however, when it comes down to it, all stakeholders will have to make the choice that is right for them.\n\nPerhaps of note, we've been in favor of bigger blocks for quite some time.  We even wrote a simulation test tool back in Oct of 2014 to stress the limits and even back then, before many of the recent performance enhancements, the results clearly showed it is capable of handling larger blocks.

But it would be permissioned ledger then, even if users didn\'t even see that. It\'s that decentralization and trustlessness are very hard to measure - and even harder is to know how much is enough.\n\nSo then go tell to the userbase "oops we actually should have smaller blocks since now I were censored out of the network because of those big blocks!

Also since you are emailing this, anyone monitoring email could intercept and take the coins. Rushwallet does allow for a passcode to be used.

We then offered an alternative by giving you the option to install a TestFlight version of the app that would accomplish the same task (but in a more complicated manner). \n\nSince you corrupted the iCloud data, and since we do not have a copy of this data (it is made clear that only our users have access to it and that we never do), we are not responsible for a refund.\n\nNext time please read the user guide carefully, and never delete data when you are unsure what it is for. In this case, the data you deleted was vital for recovering your private keys.\n\nAlso, we did not say that we would have refunded you if you did not threaten us. What we said was if you were honest with us from the beginning, we would have refunded you like we've normally done for our customers in the past when they made a mistake and lost access to their funds. \n\n- The ATOMBIT team \n\nEDIT: Grammar": 1, 'Hi markcoll,\n\nWe\'re not sure what you mean by, "the ability to rebuild the private key is the private key."

Doesn't seem like a smart idea for me to delete the iCloud data and essential lose access to my Bitcoins.\n\nMy point is this: It is not common for developers to ask for iCloud credentials from their customers. Can you imagine if a company like AgileBits did? These apps usually have a setting to turn on logs to gather the information and see how an error occurred.\n\nIt really doesn't make sense for me to me making anything up, especially since I made it clear in my post that I enjoyed your app up until now. Didn't I always thank you in my e-mail and commend you for your customer service?\n\nAnd yes, I refused the alternative solution because, as I stated before, I do not trust your application or you anymore.\n\nNow you can go back to upvoting all your comments and those that are in your favour and down voting the rest.\n\nHave a nice day.": 1, 'Actually, they claimed I corrupted/deleted the iCloud data after I sent them a screenshot showing them that there was still iCloud data from ATOMBIT stored in my iCloud account.
