There's also www.coincorner.com in the Isle of man but they do almost no volume at all (under 10 BTC/day). None of the BTC/GBP exchanges have local bank accounts - you have to use SWIFT to send the GBP (typically to some eastern european bank) which from a normal bank account costs \xc2\xa310-\xc2\xa325 per transfer (fixed price). Coinbase as you probably know also allows debit cards which often work out cheaper for small amounts. www.anxbtc.com runs a multicurrency exchange with a combined orderbook which has decent volume, but because very few GBP traders trade there mostly your orders are just being converted and matched to some other currency anyway behind the scenes.\n\nBy opening a fidorbank UK current account you can access EUR exchanges such as kraken.com (probably the best), btc-e.com, itbit.com, zyado.com, anxbtc.com and gatecoin.com which have better (EUR) volumes than the BTC/GBP markets.\n\nFidor charges very little on converting GBP to EUR - it's basically the spot rate and the SEPA transfer fee is fixed at \xc2\xa32.49 - almost all your value is being transferred. You take the money from your main bank account, send it to your Fidor account through faster payments and then send it from Fidor by SEPA to kraken (or some other exchange).\n\nThe total fees using fidor and kraken, including fx conversion, the SEPA fee and kraken's exchange fees should still be less than 1% in total - which is likely less than you'd pay using either SWIFT or a debit card to access the BTC/GBP markets.\n\nYou could send money to EUR exchanges from your existing bank account, but your bank most likely charges something like 3% fx fee and \xc2\xa310-\xc2\xa325 for the SEPA transfer fee.. there are lots of fx services you could use for the conversion like transferwise or azimo, but they won't send money to bitcoin exchanges (they are blacklisted) and even if you find a money transfer service that hasn't implemented the blacklist, most bitcoin exchanges won't accept transfers unless they come directly from an account in your own name.\n\nThere are banks in the UK offering EUR current accounts which you could use in conjunction with transferwise or azimo or a similar service to proxy funds to an EUR exchange (eg, main bank account -> transferwise -> EUR account -> BTC exchange ) however these kinds of bank accounts often tend to have nasty fees (like barclays for instance still charges \xc2\xa325 to send SEPAs from their EUR account). I believe first direct has one with \xc2\xa34 SEPA transfers which isn't too bad.\n\nFidor is a good solution.. it's only two steps (send money from main bank to fidor, send money to bitcoin exchange) and fee efficient.. you can open the account online (just need passport and utility bill scans that you probably already have from opening a bitcoin exchange account) and it has low fees.

They argue that trust in the base layer as peer-to-peer cash, or money, is essential for the entire system to work and that the other priorities of the big blockers can be handled in other ways than compromising the decentralized nature of the base layer.\n\nBig blockers, on the other hand, believe that the base layer will become prohibitively expensive under the small blockers plan, barring access to the average user who will be forced to use the payment layers which will -- they argue -- likely become centralized, leaving the average man without access to true money and suffering from many of the faults we the see in the legacy system. \n\nThey pejoratively refer to small blockers\' plan as wanting to turn Bitcoin into a "settlement network," meaning average users won\'t be able to use actual peer-to-peer bitcoin anymore because it will be too expensive.
