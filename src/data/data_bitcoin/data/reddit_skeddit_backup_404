The more transactions there are, the more fees the miner collects.  Each transaction, typically, contains a fee.\n\nCurrently, as of today, the total amount of bitcoin fees are only on average only about 10-12 bitcoins per day.\n\n@see: https://blockchain.info/charts/transaction-fees\n\nThe network produces 3600 bitcoins a day as block rewards, so currently the fees are just 0.3% of the total compensation.\n\nThis is so low that miners really don't even give a crap about transactions right now.  We frequently get zero transaction blocks because, hey, why bother to include transactions?\n\nIf the number of transactions daily rose 20 fold, then the reward would be on the order of 240 bitcoins a day.  Still no where near the mining reward of 3,600 bitcoins, but at least now we are talking 'real money'.\n\nWhat is particularly important is this.  The mining reward is going to drop in half very soon; in 2016.\n\nAfter that, because it is exponential, it will keep decreasing rapidly.\n\nThe official plan of record is that transaction fees are supposed to make up for the mining reward in the future.  However....if transaction volume doesn't increase then either (a) the fees will be so tiny that miners will lose incentive and the network will drop in security or (b) the fees will have to be raised so high to keep the network running that it will destroy one of the most important benefits of bitcoin; which is the ability to move money inexpensively.\n\nWhy miners would be against getting more transaction fees, by processing more transactions, is a mystery to me.\n\nThey must know this transition needs to happen relatively soon because the block-halving is, like Winter in the Game of Thrones, most definitely coming soon!": 3, "The transaction fees are a market where you can pay what you want and miners can choose to take your fee or not.\n\nMiners can only take up to a certain number of transactions, up to the block limit. They can choose to take fewer if they have a reason to take fewer.\n\nA bigger block could mean higher total fees for the miner, because they can take more transactions. Of course it could also mean equal or lower total fees for the miner too, because if demand remains the same and supply increases: prices should go down.\n\nIt's impossible to predict a market exactly.

If they don't have anything besides a general business registration, you must do that checking yourself.\n\nThe level of due diligence you perform is entirely up to you.

In the USA the Constitution is the foundation layer, authorising Congress to make certain laws. Based on those constitutional authorisations are the Statutes, defining the agencies that are tasked with regulating a particular area and the general terms under which the regulation will occur. Statutes change very infrequently, like every few decades.\n\nOn top of that each agency will publish its own regulations within the limits defined in the statutes. These regulations are more specific, and therefore change more often. But change is still ponderous, requiring months of consultation and redrafting before the final regulation is published. A particular regulation may last for years, but new regulations covering new issues come up fairly frequently. Ben Lawsky\'s Bitcoin regulation is an example of this.\n\nThen you have various internal interpretations, policies, training materials and guidance notes for the actual people doing the regulating. These try to keep everyone consistent across the organisation (not easy), and address new questions that arise or decisions that have been made in particular cases. These are not published, but you can get at them via FOIA requests. They can change at any time, but they have to stay consistent with the lower levels of regulation and statute.\n\nFinally you have the actual decisions made by individuals in particular cases, along with broader executive decisions about what aspects of regulation need more emphasis or time spent on them. This can shift from day to day.\n\nAlongside this you also have court decisions that can modify all the above at any time.\n\nSo the "regulatory environment" can change quite fluidly. If you are a regulated business then you keep up with this stuff for your own protection. Part of this is having regular conversations with agency staffers about changes in policy, how your business plans fit into that, and so forth. The statutes and regulations generally give the agency a wide latitude in investigating, auditing and inspecting, and coping with this is basically a cost of doing business in any regulated industry. You want to keep that cost down of course, so attracting the negative attention of your regulator is something you work hard to avoid.\n\nBack in the 2000s I was working at a medical devices manufacturer, and someone in the Quality Dept had one of these chats with the FDA, during which the FDA staffer talked about the dangers of using open source software like Linux, which was developed by hackers, and anyone could change it, so obviously it wasn\'t safe to use in medical devices. We managed to re-educate the Quality people in that case, but it was a tense time.\n\nSo probably some financial services staffer has had a quiet word with Coinbase (and probably other financial institutions) about how they view gun makers as being tempted to sell guns to the wrong people, so anyone handling money for them is likely to attract more attention, audits and the like.

You can see this since often there are thefts of Bitcoin and most of the time nobody ever gets in trouble, which shows the criminals are able to be anonymous enough to get away with it. We need to extend this anonymity to average users and make it easier.  This is why I like the recent advances on this front with the sidechains elements release which features confidential transactions.  If CT can get implemented into Bitcoin's core then there will be very strong anonymity/privacy using CT plus coinjoin, and users will be able to avoid being traced much easier.\n\nI think physical cash can be subverted easier than Bitcoin.  They can track physical dollars using serial numbers as well.  But the big thing is cash can  be seized without a crime needed as we have seen.  This happens to many people pulled over on the highway as well. With Bitcoin, if you encrypt it and back it up somewhere, its basically impossible for them to seize. They also have cash sniffing dogs, and want to make you feel like a criminal by using cash.  The government has even suggested using cash could mean you are a terrorist. \n\nI think Bitcoin is resistant to being subverted because it can't be stopped by government.  For one it is decentralized and has no central point for them to attack.  Also you can encrypt it so that they cannot seize it.  Also you can use the technology without permission.  With bank accounts you need permission.  Bitcoin is like a bank account and you are the bank, so the only one giving permission is yourself.\n\nEdit: Also with physical cash its hard to hold and transfer large amounts of it.  With Bitcoin you can hide millions or even billions of dollars on a small usb flash drive, or on a paper wallet, or even in a brain wallet.\n\n\n": 3, "11k isn't a lot of money are u poor bro?

The paper first describes some techniques in the current Bitcoin p2p network client implementation of denying blocks or transactions to particular nodes, for some length of time. Then it proposes that, while a miner is selfish mining and ahead of the rest of the network, the p2p DoS attacks can be used to partition the network view of the rest of the network. The competing miners are then mining on varying chains, which means they are collectively less likely to catch up to the selfish miner's chain, enhancing the selfish mining attack. The degree of enhancement depends strongly on how effectively the attacker can partition the network, and how many consecutive blocks they can deny.\n\n(Since it's a hot topic, I'll mention that I don't think the paper discusses the effect of block size of the effectiveness of the DoS attack. I don't see how it's relevant to the specific issues exploited, but it seems likely that it could have an effect once mitigations like dynamic timeouts are in place, esp. for slow nodes.)": 2, 'Fair point.': 5, '> A hard-fork ccan cause great pain and gnashing of teeth.

Treating their "paper" gains or losses as real only obfuscates the actual flow of money in the system.  \n\nThe only money that enters the system is provided by new investors: people who buy bitcoins to increase their holdings.  Money leaves the system mostly as revenue to the miners who sell the coins that they mine, and as payoff and profit of the divestors -- earlier investors who are reducing their holdings.  (A miner who keeps part of his production can be considered a miner who sells everything immediately and a new investor who buys back some of those coins.)

It keeps the *actual* block sizes small, reduces the rate of growth of disk space and network bandwidth, and of the time spent validating transactions.  Databases grow more slowly and get faster.  Blockchain analyzers have an easier time.  Interpreting blockchain statistics becomes quite a bit easier.  And so on.\n\nFree and almost-free transactions are an economic aberration, because one group of people (investors who buy the mined coins) is paying for the fun or another group (the people who issue transactions).  The latter should bear at least a fraction of the cost.\n\nFree and almost-free transactions will disappear if the network becomes saturated, which the small-blockians want to happen as soon as possible.  One of the new core developers guessed that, in their model, transaction fees should add to 3--6 BTC per block, on the average; which means 0.30--0.60 US$ per transaction at the current price.  Raising the block limit to 8 MB will push this event several years further in the future, but will not avoid it.  So, you can forget micropayments and any other applications that depends on free or almost-free transactions.\n\nSo, my min-fee proposal is merely to implement only part of the inevitable fee hike in the next 6 months, rather than 2-3 years from now, when the 1 MB blocks may fill up.  \n\nThe min-fee could be implemented together with raising the limit to 8 MB.

This was the case when the late Jim Flaherty asked us to study cryptocurrency. Committee members had only a vague idea of what the Minister was talking about. We had no choice but to start at the beginning, with the essential question:\n\n>**What is cryptocurrency?**\n\n>The answer is complicated. The passionate and optimistic witnesses we heard from described a genuinely new technology. One that may well usher in a world where money flows as freely as data flows over the Internet; where there are no intermediaries (such as a bank) between you and your transaction, and where the 2.5 billion unbanked people in the world can potentially enjoy access to financial services.\n\n>While the Committee gave itself a broad mandate to study \xe2\x80\x9cdigital currencies\xe2\x80\x9d in general, most witnesses discussed the subcategory of cryptocurrencies.\n\n>Cryptocurrencies belong to a nascent industry that has brought with it an entirely new vocabulary. In this report we provide a glossary of terms and technical descriptions of what cryptocurrencies are and how they work.\n\n>For this executive summary, the Committee will keep it simple:\n\n>Cryptocurrencies are a new medium of exchange. In their most basic form, they are a communications technology that offers peer-to-peer (P2P) transactions, eliminating the need for a third-party (ie. a bank) to carry out and authorize the transaction.\n\n>Of the hundreds of cryptocurrencies that have been created since 2009, Bitcoin is by far the most popular and has \nbecome synonymous with cryptocurrency itself. For these reasons, the Committee thinks a description of Bitcoin is useful to illustrate cryptocurrencies in general.\n\n>**What is Bitcoin?**\n\n>Bitcoin is a computer-coded, P2P cash system. Value is measured in units of bitcoin (lower case b) divisible (into satoshis1) like a dollar into cents. It relies on its own, unique and novel architecture. Bitcoin (upper case B) is a payment system, a decentralized (controlled by users) P2P network that allows for transactions with built-in security, eliminating the need for a central bank. This is Bitcoin\xe2\x80\x99s most distinctive feature \xe2\x80\x93 it is not associated with any physical commodity, central banking authority, or government.\n\n>Bitcoin transactions are made on the public ledger. The public ledger is exactly what it sounds like \xe2\x80\x93 a large bulletin board (written in a cryptic computer database called the blockchain). The public ledger logs and broadcasts transactions to the entire network.\n\n>Everyday transactions \xe2\x80\x93 using, for example, a debit or credit card to buy a cup of coffee \xe2\x80\x93 are tied to a bank. If you have enough money in your account, or credit on the card, the bank authorizes the transaction and you get your coffee. If you bought that same cup of coffee with bitcoin, you would simply announce it on the public ledger without the bank or any other financial institution (and all their transaction fees) being involved. The merchant gets their money and you get your coffee.\n\n>The public ledger is always accessible through computers literate in the blockchain. It cannot be forged or changed. It provides a permanent record of all bitcoin transactions that have ever happened, a history that within an hour is unalterable.\n\n>The \xe2\x80\x98if a tree falls in the forest\xe2\x80\x99 thought experiment is useful here. In the case of Bitcoin if a tree falls in the forest, and millions of independent computers with cameras record its fall, we can trust that it fell. That is the value of Bitcoin \xe2\x80\x93 the mathematical verification by millions of computers reaching a consensus that they witnessed the same thing at the same time. Trust in Bitcoin is a product of that security \xe2\x80\x93 which brings us to Bitcoin mining operations.\nBitcoin mining is a kind of lottery, except that your computer has to work in order to have a chance at winning. Of the millions of computers working to verify the public ledger, one will receive bitcoin as a reward. And presto, more bitcoin enters the money supply. Thousands of people are acquiring bitcoin this way, and an incredible amount of computing power has gathered to mine and verify the public ledger.\n\n>That\xe2\x80\x99s Bitcoin and cryptocurrency in a nutshell. But, our inquiry did not end there. Several times in our study, the Committee heard that bitcoin, the currency, is not the most significant innovation - but rather, the real innovation is blockchain technology.\n\n>**What is blockchain technology?**\n\n>Blockchain technology is an ingenious computer code, stored entirely by computers, that forms the underlying architecture for hundreds (if not thousands) of cryptocurrencies and also shows great promise in extending beyond the realm of just currency.\n\n>**Opportunities**\n\n>We took a close look at blockchain technology and considered its opportunities. Bringing financial services to the unbanked in the developing world is one of the exciting things we heard about. The Committee developed a vivid sense of how this is possible and already happening.\n\n>Another opportunity offered by blockchain technology is its ability to put a person\xe2\x80\x99s security and online identity into their own hands. Cyber-attacks for the purpose of identity theft are becoming one of the defining security threats of the 21st Century. Databases filled with our personal information are under attack from nation-states and organized crime. Hackers who target governments, data breaches at large department stores, even celebrity nude photo leaks are the result of the same problem; criminal elements breaking through cybersecurity to their prize; databases filled with valuable personal information.\n\n>FBI Director James Comey recently told CBS\xe2\x80\x99s 60 Minutes, \xe2\x80\x9cCybercrime is becoming everything in crime because people have connected their entire lives to the Internet. That\xe2\x80\x99s where those who want to steal money or hurt kids or defraud go. And so it\xe2\x80\x99s an epidemic.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n>A Canadian chartered bank explained that their cybersecurity faces thousands of attacks a day from hackers. Fortunately, they have the resources to fight this onslaught. But the same information consumers are sharing with banks, they are also sharing with online retail outlets. These retail outlets cannot deploy the financial resources a major bank puts into cybersecurity and are left vulnerable to cyber-attacks.\n\xef\xbf\xbc\n>Blockchain technology offers a secure alternative to consumers who do not wish to see their personal information fall prey to the Internet. It offers the ability to transact on the Internet without sharing their personal information with third parties whose databases make juicy targets for hackers. Instead, blockchain technology gives consumers the power to provide their own hack-proof online security.\n\n>**Risks**\n\n>The security offered by blockchain technology on the Internet has a flip side, however. The anonymity it provides presents an opportunity for criminals and terrorists. Our study takes a look at the criminality around digital currencies, most infamously represented by Silk Road transactions on the so-called Deep Web \xe2\x80\x93 an untraceable part of the Internet that allows users to avoid being found by search engines like Google.\n\n>U.S. Senator Tom Carper (Democrat, Delaware), the lawmaker who exposed online drug and criminal elements using Bitcoin, stated, \xe2\x80\x9cThe ability to send and receive money over the internet, nearly anonymously, without a third party, has a lot of wide-ranging implications. The government needs to pay attention to this technology and to understand, and where appropriate, address these implications.\xe2\x80\x9d\n>\nThe \xe2\x80\x98wide-ranging implications\xe2\x80\x99 that Senator Carper refers to are money laundering, terrorist financing, and tax evasion. These are the risks inherent in the technology and they mean that, like all industries, a certain amount of regulation is prudent. But to what extent?\n\n>The Committee traveled to New York \xe2\x80\x93 specifically to meet with the New York State Department of Financial Services \xe2\x80\x93 to hear firsthand about proposed regulations being debated, including BitLicenses. These licenses, currently being developed in consultation with stakeholders, seek to regulate the so-called \xe2\x80\x9con and off ramps\xe2\x80\x9d for exchanges that buy and sell cryptocurrencies. In short, licensing means that cryptocurrency exchanges would have to know their customers. The Committee believes this is reasonable.\n\n>**Conclusion**\n\n>**New technologies attendant to cryptocurrency have unimagined applications. We\xe2\x80\x99ve heard, and we agree, that blockchain technology is at a delicate stage in its development and use. This is why we urge the Government to explore the vast potential of this technology, while treading carefully when contemplating regulations that may restrict and stifle its use and development.**\n\n>**We believe that the best strategy for dealing with cryptocurrencies is to monitor the situation as the technology evolves; that Canada Revenue Agency and Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC) must prepare to navigate and use blockchain technology; that this technology offers new ways to protect the personal information of Canadians; and, finally, that this technology requires a light regulatory touch \xe2\x80\x93 almost a hands off approach. In other words, not necessarily regulation, but regulation as necessary.**\n\n/fin.': 3, "he just linked the thread via twitter. it's not an explicit confirmation that they put this on the blockchain themselves.": 4, "Using a digital signature in this manner can be a double-edged sword.

Thanks.\n\nGreat!\n\nBasically both let you replace one transaction with another that pays a\nhigher fee. First-seen-safe replace-by-fee adds the additional criteria\nthat all outputs of the old transaction still need to be paid by the new\ntransaction, with >= as many Bitcoins. Basically, it makes sure that if\nsomeone was paid by tx1, then tx2 will still pay them.\n\nI\'ve written about how wallets can use RBF and FSS-RBF to more\nefficiently use the blockchain on the bitcoin-development mailing list:\n\nhttp://www.mail-archive.com/bitcoin-development@.../msg07813.html\nhttp://www.mail-archive.com/bitcoin-development@.../msg07829.html\n\nBasically, for the purpose of increasing fees, RBF is something like %50\ncheaper than CPFP, and FSS-RBF is something like %25 cheaper.\n\nIn addition, for ease of implementation, my new FSS-RBF has a number of\nother restrictions. For instance, you can\'t replace multiple\ntransactions with one, you can\'t replace a transaction whose outputs\nhave already been spent, you can\'t replace a transaction with one that\nspends additional unconfirmed inputs, etc. These restrictions aren\'t\n"set in stone", but they do make the code simpler and less likely to\nhave bugs.\n\nIn comparison my previous standard RBF patch can replace multiple\ntransactions with one, can replace long chains of transactions, etc.\nIt\'s willing to do more computation before deciding if a transaction\nshould be replaced, with more complex logic; it probably has a higher\nchance of having a bug or DoS attack.\n\nYou\'ve probably seen the huge controversy around zeroconf with regard to\nstandard replace-by-fee. While FSS RBF doesn\'t make zeroconf any safer,\nit also doesn\'t make it any more dangerous, so politically with regard\nto zeroconf it makes no difference. You *can* still use it doublespend\nby taking advantage of how different transactions are accepted\ndifferently, but that\'s true of *every* change we\'ve ever made to\nBitcoin Core - by upgrading to v0.10 from v0.9 you\'ve also "broken"\nzeroconf in the same way.\n\n\nHaving said that... honestly, zeroconf is pretty broken already. Only\nwith pretty heroic measures like connecting to a significant fraction of\nthe Bitcoin network at once, as well as connecting to getblocktemplate\nsupporting miners to figure out what transactions are being mined, are\nservices having any hope of avoiding getting ripped off. For the average\nuser their wallets do a terrible job of showing whether or not an\nunconfirmed transaction will go through. For example, Schildbach\'s\nBitcoin wallet for Android has no code at all to detect double-spends\nuntil they get mined, and I\'ve been able to trick it into showing\ncompletely invalid transactions. In fact, currently Bitcoin XT will\nrelay invalid transactions that are doublepsends, and Schildbach\'s\nwallet displays them as valid, unconfirmed, payments. It\'s really no\nsurprise to me that nearly no-one in the Bitcoin ecosystem accepts\nunconfirmed transactions without some kind of protection that doesn\'t\nrely on first-seen-safe mempool behavior. For instance, many ATM\'s these\ndays know who their customers are due to AML requirements, so while you\ncan deposit Bitcoins and get your funds instantly, the protection for\nthe ATM operator is that they can go to the police if you rip them off;\nI\'ve spoken to ATM operators who didn\'t do this who\'ve lost hundreds or\neven thousands of dollars before giving up on zeroconf.\n\nMy big worry with zeroconf is a service like Coinbase or Shapeshift\ncoming to rely on it, and then attempting to secure it by gaining\ncontrol of a majority of hashing power. For instance, if Coinbase had\ncontracts with 80% of the Bitcoin hashing power to guarantee their\ntransactions would get mined, but 20% of the hashing power didn\'t sign\nup, then the only way to guarantee their transactions could be for the\n80% to not build on blocks containing doublespends by the 20%. There\'s\nno way in a decentralized network to come to consensus about what\ntransactions are or are not valid without mining itself, so you could\nend up in a situation where unless you\'re part of one of the big pools\nyou can\'t reliably mine at all because your blocks may get rejected for\ncontaining doublespends.\n\nOne of my goal with standard replace-by-fee is to prevent this scenario\nby forcing merchants and others to implement ways of accepting zeroconf\ntransactions safely that work in a decentralized environment regardless\nof what miners do; we have a stronger and safer Bitcoin ecosystem if\nwe\'re relying on math rather than trust to secure our zeroconf\ntransactions. We\'re also being more honest to users, who right now often\nhave the very wrong impression that unconfirmed transactions are safe to\naccept - this does get people ripped off all too often!\n\n\nAnyway, sorry for the rant! FWIW I updated my FSS-RBF patch and am\nwaiting to get some feedback:\n\n    https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6176\n\nSuhas Daftuar did find a pretty serious bug in it, now fixed.

But, this recent trend I have noticed, of threats to leave Bitcoin and/or cryptocurrency in general because things may not happy perfectly as you wish, is frankly childish and insufferable. No one gets 100% of what they want; we learn this while we develop as children. Further, nothing is ever permanently lost in such situations. There are always creative solutions to be discovered that can ameliorate compromises that were made.\n\nMaking threats does not advance one\'s cause and lead to a good compromise from which something can be built; it only detracts from it in the public eye by showing one\'s immaturity. Hearn was wrong with his confrontational approach to the debate (as the community has slowly recognized), but so are you guys for making various provocative and inflammatory statements.\n\nYou may think you are acting very principled and claim you are "fighting for the cypherpunk vision," but fundamentally, ideology does not win debates nor lead to success in the real world. Realistically, good ideas are found everywhere and the truth lies somewhere between two extremes. e.g. Satoshi, who was the one to actually develop Bitcoin as a practical and successful cryptocurrency, obviously took ideas from cypherpunk ideology, but he demonstrably also believed Bitcoin could be successful in its high ambitions without radical decentralization (re: fewer high-powered nodes, & larger/unlimited block size). I give this example not to say that is the right way, but to help illustrate how you may think your ideology is the One Truth (and I may sympathize, and even agree to some degree), but that creative practical thinking like that of Satoshi\'s is what truly works, without being completely wedded to only one way of doing things. Rarely is the best way of doing things a black and white matter.': 0, "> Hopefully we can trust the miners to stay at sub-1MB blocks despite an increased limit until the network can handle larger.\n\nIs it wrong to assume IF 90% of miners vote for bigger blocks, we can assume other 'non miners' can handle bigger blocks also. (This assumes a 90% consensus needed for a doubling) Meaning the throughput of the lowers 10% of miners decides if blocks get bigger. \n\nThe increase is limited to doubling and average blocks should be filled if I remember correctly. Meaning at each state the network capacity can be doubled, only if the current capacity is almost filled and miners agree they can handle the extra traffic. This seems like a very neat system to me.  \n\nAlso when block rewards drop and fees become more important, miners can decide to build up fee pressure by not letting the cap be raised. If they decide bigger blocks are needed they can do so. ": 2, '> supermajority vote" (80%) \n\nThis is worse, not better. The problem isn\'t not enough power in the hands of a majority, but a majority having too much power to freeze the status quo in spite of growing demand. The real majority in the market who we should be worried about is the customers who send transactions. \n\nI don\'t understand why people are obsessed with China. If blocks in fact get bigger due to higher demand that Chinese couldn\'t handle, that would mean the market forces are breaking up the big player (others will replace them due to reduced difficulty); but voting gives them even more power instead. \n\nThe voting on the block limit turns the dynamic floating system that responds and adapts to market forces info a rigid centralized cartel of privileged existing miners.
