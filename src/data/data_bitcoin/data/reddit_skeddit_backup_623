This would stop people who are testing stolen cards from being able to re-buy the same order again.  If the hold was for a long enough time frame, it would deter people from cancelling orders and rebuying.  \n\nIn conjunction with the account holds, purse needs to keep track of IP addresses to the best of their abilities, and at least make a valid attempt at creating a system that actively makes it difficult for scammers to constantly create new accounts.

Amazon has no idea the transaction is originating from the service and so can't factor this into it's fraud detection algorithm. There is also no way for the service to get feedback from amazon regarding which purchases were done by carders and which weren't. By definition the service cannot provide statistics on fraud. For all you know Amazon and the CC companies are eating it, and you and the recipient of the goods are non the wiser.\n\n2. And most importantly, the person receiving the goods is solving major problems for the carder. The problems are: \n\n* An address to send the stolen goods to\n\n* A liquid market to receive cash for stolen goods.\n\nThe person receiving the goods has no idea how many times her address has been used for fraud, and has no way of knowing at what point it might trigger an investigation or police knocking on her door. (as I believe has already happened with purse.io)\n\nNow I know the usual comeback is to pull out some statistics about the sites only having a 0.2% fraud rate, but as I pointed out in point 1, all that risk is allocated to Amazon, so you have very little data on it.\n\nThere is no way I could ever recommend any of these services to people, or use it myself. Imagine you recommend it to your wife's friend and then her door gets kicked in by the cops because over the past year her address has been used by carders on 4 different occasions out of 50 or something. (the carder also gets to see your name and city I beleive)\n\nThis is a cute little game on the system, but ultimately you profit from allocating risk to Amazon / CC companies and legal risk to your customers, with at least the second one being immoral in my opinion unless the risks are correctly laid out (and you don't have the data to do this)\n\nEDIT: spelling and formatting\n\n\n\n": 7, "Purse was caught lying given that they said only 4 instances had ever happened and someone was able to compile a list of 7 or more in less than 30 minutes.

It is as if I wanted to give you money, but I only had cash and you are not within physical proximity, so I go to the bank, give them the cash and then they deposit it into your account. They are merely the middlemen, necessary because central banks have no easy way of handing out large volumes of money directly to non-bank entities. \n\nThe reason QE hasn't cause inflation is because the ship is sinking faster than printing money can keep it afloat. That is to say, the whole point of QE IS actually to create inflation (or perhaps the cynic might say the whole point is to let the rich hoard as much stuff as possible before the ship goes down). QE is a desperate attempt to prevent deflation, because if deflation occurs, the whole fiat monetary system will collapse. \n\nThe reason deflation is so dangerous to the fiat monetary system is because all money in the system is created as debt. That is to say, money is created through lending. Because most of those loans include interest, the sum total debt owed in the public and private sectors combined is actually greater than the sum total of money in the economy. Because the the repayment of debt simultaneously extinguishes money, new money must constantly be made in order to keep pace with the repayment of loans. Since all new fiat money created to pay back the existing debts includes debt of its own, the system can never afford to stop to catch a breath. \n\nFiat money IS debt, and the entire system is one in which we must borrow from Peter to pay back Paul. This is why the system depends on inflation, why you need central banks to artificially guarantee inflation, because inflation guarantees that debts can be repaid. Deflation, on the other hand, essentially means that the value of money is increasing, which makes it impossible to pay back existing loans and undesirable to take out new loans, and since our entire monetary system depends on people taking loans, deflation effectively heralds the collapse of the entire system.

David Hume once came up with this thought experiment: suppose that in the middle of the night, the paper money in everyone's wallet, safe, or other stash, suddenly doubled in quantity - so there is twice as much money, but no other changes are made. Would the country then suddenly be enormously better off - would we all be twice as wealthy as we are now? No, in fact we would have exactly the same amount of wealth as we presently do, for there would be exactly the same amount of capital around, and the same availability of labor. (Everyone could then double their prices.) What this shows is that increases in the money supply do not translate to increased wealth; it can also be used to explain why increases in the money supply cause inflation.\n>> \n>> Of course, such a scenario is impossible: all our money cannot magically double in quantity. But that is not the point. The reason the thought experiment is useful is that this way of thinking of it enables you to mentally isolate just the one factor desired for consideration: the quantity of money. We imagine just the quantity of money changed and nothing else. In the real world, one cannot do this. In the real world, it is not possible to change the money supply uniformly (i.e. increasing everyone's money, without redistribution) and it is impossible to change the money supply without affecting the economy in some other way at the same time. So I cannot cite a historical case in which nothing but the money supply was altered. This is why thought experiments are useful.\n\nPlease do yourself a favor and shut the fuck up.
