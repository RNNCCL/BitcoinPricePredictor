Also you should note that BTS is nowhere in the equation. In the video I showed the bts:bitUSD orderbook as it is the most active. There is a bitUSD:bitBTC order book which you would use for a bitcoin decentralized exchange.\n\nThe process looks like this for selling bitcoin for USD\n\n1. Transfer btc > bitBTC using one of many gateways. (this process takes minutes and you are exposed to counterparty risk during this time.)\n\n2. Place order on the decentralized orderbook. There is no counter party risk before or after the trade is executed  and your order may sit on the exchange for long periods of time .\n\n3. Transfer bitUSD > USD using one of many gateways. (this process takes hours/days and you are exposed to counterparty risk during this time.)\n\nThe counter party risk you experience on steps 1 and 3 are the same as you experience at say Bitstamp.  However, for most people the vast majority of their time they are exposed occurs in step 2.  During step 2 on a decentralized exchange all counter party risk is removed. And perhaps equally importantly is because the huge carrot has been removed the number of hackers trying to hack gateways will be greatly reduced, making steps 1 and 3 significantly safer as well.\n\n': 2, 'This decentralized exchange is not ready for prime time just yet... but man it is getting close. Huge security boost for the bitcoin eco-system': 1, 'The risk on a centralized exchange is primarily all the hours/days/months it is sitting there waiting for trading opportunities.  With a decentralized exchange the exposure time is just the few minutes or hours it takes for the centralized party to do the gateway function to get you onto the decentralized exchange.  There your assets can sit, available for trading, for as long as you want, free from counterparty risk.\n\nAnd, when the time comes to cash back out, you have your choice of which gateway you want to trust with that brief transaction.  You can even split up your withdrawals into several parts on several exchanges.  \n\nSo, the chances that a centralized gateway will get hacked during the few minutes you spend there is vanishingly small.

Simply wire me USD with your account name in the subject and I will send you bitUSD minus a %spread.  From that moment on you are decentralized.  This solves the problem of people using mtgox as a wallet.  The exchanges no longer have wallets. Your blockchain wallet is the exchange.  It may not be perfect but it is a significant leap forward.  Also the benefit exists that all order books are centralized on a decentralized ledger.  That means tighter spreads and a more effecient eco-system.  thanks for the great questions.': 2, 'I think the implication here is that once you have obtained BTS/bitUSD/bitBTC you can store them on the decentralized exchange without having to worry about it being compromised. \n\nYou are correct though, there is still exposure to centralized BTC exchanges in order to obtain these assets, but once you have them they can all be safely stored on the decentralized exchange.': 2, 'Hi Kyle,\n\nThat is not the reason bitshares has value.

I think most purveyors of bacn would happily send you a few satoshis to ensure delivery. It\'s not much more money than they already pay and even with a small bitcoin fee it\'s still way cheaper than direct mail. In fact, paying for delivery would add legitimacy and filter out their pseudo-bacn competition.\n\nHowever, I\'m not totally comfortable with a company running this. I think it needs to be built into a next-gen email protocol with lots of security built in. It seems like every time I read about somebody getting their btc stolen it\'s because their email got hacked. I\'m not sure how it happened, but slowly over the course of the last few decades, developers and corporations have based so much of their security apparatus on customer\'s email accounts (password resets, etc.) that email has become a honeypot that hackers simply can\'t resist and yet email was not designed to be this critical to people\'s security; it simply doesn\'t measure up. Corporations and startups adding features on top of SMTP and such is nice, but it\'s can\'t beat having good security rolled into the protocol itself. Unfortunately, nobody but techies use GPG/PGP and it\'s difficult for normal people to even understand why it\'s necessary and useful. If it was built into the protocol people could publicly post their email addresses again. It\'s kind of ridiculous that we have to do stuff like =satoshi= (at) gmail =dot= com. \n\nPeople often think of success as a straight line from point A to point B. But in reality, there\'s lots of detours and roundabouts that need to be taken before you can reach your goal. In some ways I feel like bitcoin\'s success is dependent on a superior email protocol -- one that doesn\'t exist yet. Satoshi himself proposed this very idea -- of controlling your inbox through fee setting -- and I think it\'s a good one. However, this creates yet another pile of bitcoins stored on a startup\'s servers that is going to attract hackers and thieves like flies to honey. If it was built into the email protocol it should be more secure if only because the wallets would be spread across the blockchain. However, putting every single email through the main blockchain would be too much so this could be a great use-case for sidechains.\n\n/rambling': 6, "Oh yeah.
