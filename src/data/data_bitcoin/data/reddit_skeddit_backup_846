And so on...  Then these truths are used to develop economic theories to ensure they are not violated if empirical evidence, or indirect economic measurements obscure these realities. \n\nKeynesian economics, or what I assume you are referring to as "real economics" generally takes empirical measurements and correlations and tries to draw mathematical relationships between.  This is largely done without taking into account that all of these measurements are both indirect and abstractions of real economic activity.  Therefore cannot be measured the same way one can take the temperature outside.  In most cases basic truths get completely ignored in favor of a neat mathematical model.  This leads to government and central planners thinking that all they have to do is change the measurements through manipulating the money supply or prices and thinking reality will shift to match the numbers.\n\nIn reality, prices are a response to a physical change in either demand for consuming a product or the ability and difficulty to produce it.  Manipulating the price does not change the reality of the shift that has occurred, it simply covers up the problem in an effort to make the numbers look like they did when everything was running smoothly.  The price mechanism moves in order to tell us something important about a change in reality, manipulating the price does not fix the problem, but rather obscures the economy\'s ability to tell us what is wrong in the first place.\n\nFor those interested:  Here is a simple breakdown of the major differences between the two schools.  \n\n[Austrian School vs. Kaynesians](http://theaustrianinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Economics-Infographic.jpg)\n': -6, 'He is losing because his genes are being unapologetically weeded out of existence ': -4, "also, 'work in epigenetics'.\n\nGo on please, tell.

Now, they can\'t stop every citizen from using bitcoin, but there will be no business that advertises accepting bitcoin, and the government has effectively shut down the ability to do business in bitcoin. ~~Bitcoin is just a technological toy if it can\'t be used for business.~~\n\n**Bitcoin also isn\'t immune from recourse, at least from a government <-> citizen perspective:**\n\nThe government doesn\'t have to be able to print the currency to provide legal recourse over it as long as they can exert influence over whomever the recourse is being applied to. If a thief steals my dollars or my bitcoin, the result is the same for me to get compensation: he gets caught, he goes to jail, he is ordered to return what he took. If he doesn\'t have the money to give back, the government isn\'t going to print more dollars for me, so the fact that they can\'t create more bitcoins for me is irrelevant.\n\nThis is not something that bitcoin must provide, but rather something the government provides.\n\nThe best analogy for bitcoin in this context is "digital cash" - something that credit cards and checks and paypal are not. It is the first technology where I can send someone something of value, digitally, without having to trust any individual third party. It is just the same as handing someone a five dollar bill.\n\n-----\n\nThe problems with credit cards are twofold:\n\n* They trick you into thinking you\'re getting something for free when you\'re not\n* They make you trust every single merchant to protect your payment information and identity.\n\nYou pay for every chargeback and every reward that you get from your credit card. You can game the system in the short run, but when considering everyone as a whole, it\'s only the credit card executives that are getting anything:\n\n1. In order to pay for your rewards and refund fraudulent activities, credit card companies make the merchants foot the bill for the chargebacks on top of charging them a 2-3% fee.\n2. Merchants pass this on to you either by raising prices or adding a "convenience fee" for using a credit card. Several places around where I live charge more to use a credit card than if I write a check that bounces!\n\nIf you want these features with bitcoin, just set aside 1-2% of every purchase you make, and give it back to yourself as needed whenever you get scammed.

Then notice that you pay 10 to 100 times more for your credit card.\nCredit card companies also don\'t have the ability to cancel your "insurance".\n\n> That\'s not an issue with credit card companies though.\n\nYou are right, does that change the validity of his argument?\nThe point of Bitcoin is that you can keep 100% of your money in your own possession.

With a real bank account at a bank, there are a number of ways that money leaves the account without my authorization, and then I have to fight/work to get the money back.\n\n> But if you\'re only putting 2% away (assuming equal transactions) then won\'t you have to go through 50 transactions to cover the cost of a single scam? I feel like the 2-3% fee is worth it in comparison for the "insurance" it provides.\n\nI suppose it depends on how often you\'re getting scammed. It\'s less about the number of transactions, more about the volume of money. If we assume you\'re spending $1000 a month, are you getting scammed more than $20 a month?\n\n> That\'s not an issue with credit card companies though. It\'s like saying no bank vault is safe because at least one person always has the ability to open it. Besides isn\'t the Mt Gox fiasco a strong counter to this argument?\n\nMt. Gox actually plays a similar role of Target when I look at it (Mt. Gox was not and never purported to be a bank): A third party which was trusted to secure and not abuse customer information which allows them access to the customer\'s funds. Arguably a bank does that too, but that\'s the *purpose* of a bank; at Target and Mt. Gox it was merely a necessity of doing business, which I think results in a lower level of scrutiny in practice.\n\nAnd yes, a number of people would argue that the benefit of bitcoin is that you don\'t have to rely/trust the banks. The problem is we can\'t look at just one component in a vacuum. Bitcoin isn\'t about getting large corporations like banks or credit card companies out of our money so much as it is fixing the system. Right now, these large companies essentially fill that role (Secure storage of money+easily transferring money), and bitcoin simply tries to fill that role better.\n\nInsurance is great, but I\'d rather not need the insurance in the first place.\n\n> Is this how it works? Just because they have your credit card data doesn\'t mean they have the authorisation to pull your funds out.\n\nYeah, that\'s how it works. Visa gets a connection from Target saying "Hey! /u/albynobanana wants to pay me $32.95. Can you send me that money?" And Visa just *sends it to Target* without any confirmation from you. Now, you can dispute/chargeback the amount, sure and Target is big enough that it wouldn\'t risk anything, but why does this problem exist in the first place?\n\nPaypal\'s a step in the right direction. No merchant can touch my funds unless I log into Paypal and authorize the payment and the amount. I only have to trust Paypal, instead of every merchant I do business with. The problem is that it still leaves Paypal to pick and choose what kind of business I can do. For a while, trying to do anything bitcoin-related would get your Paypal account frozen. Bitcoin just tries to solve the problem wholesale by removing the need of trust altogether in payments.\n\n> See you\'re saying security without trust, but all I see is security without oversight. As you said before, it only takes one person. I see a third party, especially some form of government watchdog, necessary to prevent illicit trading.\n\nYou still have oversight in the same way that it was handled before:\n\n1. Person is caught committing crime/fraud\n2. Person is punished for committing crime/fraud\n3. Others that would commit crime/fraud choose not to commit crime/fraud out of fear of punishment.\n\nThat all operates the same way with bitcoin. To be clear, the government has no means to stop illicit trading if someone wants to make an illicit trade and they don\'t tell the government that they\'re going to do that. The trade is made, the person gets caught, and the person goes to jail. But the trade is still made, and the market has to deal with the effects if the government can\'t make the trader deal with the effects.\n\nCurrently, there is trust and oversight. I trust that Target will not leak my credit card info, and there is oversight from the government to make sure that Target has proper policies in place. Bitcoin aims to remove the burden of the customer trusting the merchant. There will still be oversight, it just won\'t have to be about how Target is securing my credit card information.': 0, "Great post, and I agree with the general points.
