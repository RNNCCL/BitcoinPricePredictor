The alternative to not adopting segwit, is the *guarantee* of incurring these high costs.\n\nTo illustrate the reason for this discount: By adopting a segwit transaction scheme in your application / usage of the Bitcoin network, you can pay the fee you would normally pay for current transactions, and have your transactions propagate through the network with 4 times as much priority as usual.\n\nEDIT: (Thanks for the replies so far I have added a couple more)\n> 7) Why is any fee discount necessary?\n\nWitness size discount*\n\n1.

The only differences between segwit as a soft fork and as a hard fork is where the witness root hash goes and whether the witness data is counted in the block size or not. With the witness root hash, it could have either been in the block header or in the coinbase transaction. **Segwit chose to put it in the coinbase transaction as an OP_RETURN output.** This is safer because this allows for segwit to be done as a softfork even though the data is still the same size as it would have been if it were in the header.
