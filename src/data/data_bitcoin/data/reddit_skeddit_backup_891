': 2, 'I know this, thanks, this is another solution, until 1* confirmation.': 1, 'Well, "secured" is a very broad term. At that point the unconfirmed transaction is in the mempool of the Bitcoin nodes, but it is not confirmed by miners and permanently stored in the blockchain. At this point it COULD be possible that a miner publishes a block that contains a transaction that invalidates the unconfirmed transaction in the mempool. Though it\'s fairly unlikely unless it was the miner who published the first transaction. Though IIRC, GHash performed exactly that type of double spend attack back in 2013, which they blamed upon a rogue employee.': 1, '1) Transactions tend to propagate through the majority of nodes on the network in ~1 second: https://getaddr.bitnodes.io/dashboard/\n\n2) Nodes already do this. If they receive a transaction that they see is trying to spend an output that has already been used, they ignore it and do not propagate the transaction to their peers. This is why double spending is hard - you have to broadcast multiple transactions within an extremely small time frame and you have to insert them on nearly opposite edges of the node mesh.': 3, "Yes I know but here is a bit different, you haven't to check all to accept a transaction, only the non confirmed one, and it's not about accept or not, but to relay or not, anyway I don't find anything interesting, seems so to me for a sec.

You need confirmations to prove a majority consensus.\n\nI'm not sure on exact tx propagation times.  I think it's somewhere in the range of 5 to 15 secs.  Maybe you could do some experiments and try to measure it?": 1, "Yes, this is a gaffe, I'm thinking better on this, and it's very difficult to do, because a people can double spend, in every moment until the confirmation, so I can't simply wait few seconds to get the unconfirmet transaction in all the nodes. Because then a second transaction can be accepted from some nodes that aren't honest and maybe they are faster to mine it! Anyway probably implementing a way to accept only first first unconfirmed transaction will help to stop the spreading of double spends...maybe...\n\nAnyway, any hint on the first question?": 1, "There's companies already doing that.  Eg, BitPay etc can place nodes around the network to try to detect double spends as early as possible.  I think Mycelium has a Transaction Radar feature that tries to do the same thing.\n\nIt's not a guarantee though.  As always, there's no magical way to get around the need for confirmations for security, and trying to prevent zero-conf double spends is usually just giving people a false sense of security.": 0, 'Ah, ok, I got it!

But for a short while, at least, some people thought he might be. \xe2\x80\x9cSatoshi Nakamoto\xe2\x80\x9d is the most famous non-person on the internet. The name is a pseudonym, meant to hide the shadowy programmer (or programmers) behind Bitcoin, a computerised currency designed to liberate money from the control of any central bank. Speculating about his true identity is a popular pastime in some of the more esoteric corners of the web.\n\n> Still, Mr Finney was a good guess. As a cryptographer and a programmer he had the skills, for Bitcoin relies on cryptography to function. Having been an early adopter (he was, with the fabled Mr Nakamoto, a partner in the world\xe2\x80\x99s first ever Bitcoin transaction) he certainly had the pedigree. And he had the beliefs, too. He was one of the original \xe2\x80\x9ccypherpunks\xe2\x80\x9d, a small, influential band of cryptographers, philosophers and programmers who, in the early 1990s, helped stamp the early internet with its culture of rebelliousness, distrust of government and optimistic belief in the liberating power of technology.\n\n> Two decades before Edward Snowden put the subject on front pages the world over, the cypherpunks were discussing how the coming age of the internet would allow governments and companies to pry ever more deeply and easily into the lives of their citizens and customers. But that same computer revolution would also hand ordinary people the power to fight back against the organisations that presumed to run their lives. Until that point, good quality encryption had been something available only to spy agencies and big companies. Computers would give people the power to carve out a mathematically guaranteed refuge from the powers that be, and to have a conversation that was provably, reliably private.\n\n> For Mr Finney, who had spent his high-school years imbibing the supercharged libertarianism of Ayn Rand, and who was now earning a living writing video games, that was a heady challenge. He accepted it with gusto. \xe2\x80\x9cHere we are faced with the problems of loss of privacy, creeping computerisation, massive databases, more centralisation,\xe2\x80\x9d he wrote. \xe2\x80\x9c[But] the computer can be used as a tool to liberate and protect people, rather than to control them.\xe2\x80\x9d His aim was clear: \xe2\x80\x9cThe work we are doing here, broadly speaking, is dedicated to this goal of making Big Brother obsolete.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n> He began helping, unpaid, with a program called Pretty Good Privacy (PGP), putting in enough hours that it became a second job. It was well-named: even today, messages scrambled with it are thought to be unbreakable (Mr Snowden used PGP for his e-mail exchanges with the journalists to whom he leaked his documents). In 1991 Phil Zimmermann, PGP\xe2\x80\x99s chief developer, uploaded it to the internet. America\xe2\x80\x99s spies were aghast. Exporting encryption\xe2\x80\x94which was classed as a weapon\xe2\x80\x94was illegal. And here a group of self-proclaimed techno-liberators were proposing to just hand it over to anyone in the world\xe2\x80\x94diplomat, criminal, teenager\xe2\x80\x94who wanted it. When the legal kerfuffle died down, Mr Zimmermann hired Mr Finney as his new company\xe2\x80\x99s second-ever employee.\n\n> **Suspended animation**\n\n> For a long time he ran a free \xe2\x80\x9cremailer\xe2\x80\x9d, a server designed to forward e-mail anonymously, no questions asked, to anyone in the world. Whose business was it, after all, what people wanted to send to each other, except the sender and the recipient? His interests extended beyond privacy. He was fascinated by the sorts of futures that technology might unlock, speculating about everything from how morals evolve in rich societies to when clean energy might finally displace fossil fuels. Away from the screen, he was chatty and gregarious, a keen skier and runner.\n\n> He had to stop in 2009, when he was diagnosed with motor neurone disease (MND). The illness gradually paralyses its victims, but, with characteristic logic, Mr Finney pointed out that it was not a death sentence\xe2\x80\x94even when those muscles necessary for breathing gave out, life could carry on with the aid a mechanical ventilator. He was surprised, he said, to discover that most people with the disease \xe2\x80\x9cchose\xe2\x80\x9d death instead. After all, MND robs sufferers only of their bodies, not their minds, and for him it was the mind that mattered. His interests went beyond computers and coding, to sociology, psychology and how technology might improve society. As long as there was a way to communicate with the outside world\xe2\x80\x94even if it was only by having a computer interpret the twitchings of a facial muscle\xe2\x80\x94he wanted to endure.\n\n> When even that became difficult, he put a final plan into action. In accordance with his wishes, he was disconnected from his ventilator. As soon as he had been declared legally dead, technicians from a firm called Alcor froze his body in liquid nitrogen.

It makes me wonder how one cannot notice someone carrying a lethal weapon around for no reason whatsoever. I would generally be scared if someone unknown to me carries a gun around. I know nothing of their firearm training, their psyche, their intentions, nor their reactions to certain things. What if something I did could potentially be interpreted as threatening? Would I get a gun pointed at me? Would the person pull the trigger? Again, I know nothing of the unknown person, so anything can happen. Is that a situation one would want to find oneself in? It just seems like madness to me.\n\nSeriously, there are so many factors involved in this, that I would be extremely scared wherever I went if I knew people were allowed by law to carry firearms around.\n\nI shoud've worded myself more carefully regarding the constitutional rights. What I meant to point out is that gun laws, both in the constitution should be up for discussion and not be regarded as the ultimate source of truth regarding the matter. If practiced in such a way, it turns into a dogma. Regarding the constitutional rights, I understand that it is more or less a holy document in the US. That makes some of the constitutional rights, like gun laws extremely hard to discuss.\n\nFreedom of speech should never be taken out of the constitution, simply because it is an essential tool to keep the government in check.

What purpose does it serve that people are allowed to carry a weapon around all the time?\n\nGood question. The problem is one of information and propaganda. Interests looking to subvert a free country's government can be quite clever - and patient. You don't take away people's gun rights suddenly, and noticeably, because then you'll get obvious resistance and your motives will be exposed. Instead you, how shall I say, try brain washing the population into banning their own guns, getting them to take away their own rights. How? Lots of tricks can be used. Any gun violence (real or staged) serves to show people that guns can be dangerous. If you think I'm off base, consider the purpose of this very thread. The website is trying to re-establish gun rights *taken away* in California, rights the Constitution already supposedly establishes in the 2nd Amendment.\n\nSo it's not about carrying a gun on Monday, but keeping it in your house other days. The point is people should feel like they are FREE to carry guns any time, and to prove that, they should actually practice it. The power is in the FREEDOM to carry the gun, not actually the carrying of it. That's the confusing part.\n\n> So, essentially you are saying that the people should be able to break the government's 'violence monopoly'?\n\nYes, exactly.\n\n> Of course, but there are other ways of keeping one's government in check. Free and fair media, which is arguably lacking in the US, is one such tool.\n\nYep. You said it yourself (the lacking part). Guns and violence are not the first resort, they are the last. However, guns need to be there as the last, because relying on media etc. alone may not be enough, again, as you yourself point out.\n\n>I am not quite sure if the Egyptian population having weapons during the Egyptian revolution would change anything. \n\nIt could have, but there is another element, which is education. Having guns alone isn't enough. You have to have people who *know* what they are trying to achieve politically with any violent acts. In Egypt they didn't have that. \n\nThe first uprising was to depose Hosni Mubarak (who threatened to run through a city with tanks killing thousands). US President Obama basically told Mubarak to leave (he was essentially a US puppet).  So, instead of Egyptians establishing a free government along the lines of the original American one, they got Morsi, another US puppet, and they were right back where they started being ruled by a tyrant, so violence continued. I think Morsi is gone now too, and I've lost track of what's happening there. The point is, without a clear rule of law establishing a free socity - like the original American one under the Constitution - any uprisings do little good, as the old government is simply handed over to different tyrant rulers.\n": 1, "What don't you like about?

Study after Study has shown that violent crime is lower in areas that have high gun ownership. The nature of non-violent crimes changes were criminals not wanting to be killed by a home owner with a gun conduit their crimes in the day time or when a home is unoccupied.  There  also is not an increase of gun violence but a decrease in gun violence when open carry laws are in enacted.  \n\nIt was not until the end of the 19th Century and the beginning of the 20th Century in this country that gun laws restricting citizens ability to carry, purchase, and store begun to be enacted.  Up to the enactment of these news that started out as state laws not federal laws Americans carry the arms openly. The reason these new laws were enacted was under the guise of "public safety", when in reality it was one segment "white people" removing the ability of another segment "black people" from having the ability to defend themselves. \n\nThis later segment was terrorize, brutal murder almost at a will, and because of firearm restriction could not defend themselves when literally an armed mob with pitch forks outside their home was coming for them.  This segment could not turn to the authorities because the authorities were often in the crowd of the mob and due to Societal Norms (Racism) instead of abiding by the Constitutions the courts upheld these laws in the name of protecting society. \nWhen Majority of societal norms change mid-20th century, the civil rights acts pass, and the segment of society that had been oppress all those years began to exercise their Constitutional Rights freely without fear of oppression it still irk people. Many of these people still felt it was necessary to keep gun laws(a lot of other laws) in place but more importantly began to increase the enacting of these laws through many states and eventual making gun laws a Federal matter. \n\nIn California the year that the gun restriction was put place the Black Panthers had famously march into the California Legislation building and protest their grievances in front of the Legislative body with shoot guns.  All which was perfectly legal to do at the time. When you look at the historical record at the time people supporting the law directly cite this incident as the reason for the law felt necessary that "these people" should not be able to do this again.  \nI will not gone in how this Californian Law became the domino effect of legislation action were any object a person is carrying is considered a weapon, how only certain segments of people in our society have these weapons laws applied to them at statistical unexplainable higher rate then others, or how police expansion/militarization through out the country was possible because of these gun laws. \n\nPeople should be able to exercise their rights without fear from the government or restrictions by the government which saddles their rights with unnecessary burdens.': 2, 'Edit: responding to wrong person \n\nAgree with what you are saying ': 1, "Well, for one I'm from Europe (more specifically Norway) so I don't get the whole deal with gun ownership and carrying publicly anyway.

The new routing prefix for the combined network aggregates the prefixes of the constituent networks. It must not contain other prefixes of networks that do not lie in the same routing path. The process of forming a supernet is often called supernetting, prefix aggregation, route aggregation, or route summarization.\nSupernetting within the Internet serves as a preventive strategy to avoid topological fragmentation of the IP address space by using a hierarchical allocation system that delegates control of segments of address space to regional network service providers.This method facilitates regional route aggregation. The benefits of supernetting are conservation of address space and efficiencies gained in routers in terms of memory storage of route information and processing overhead when matching routes.

You could only pay with it (for free) and it'd be shipped to you one-time in a regular manner however long that normally takes. \n\nAlmost nobody would give a shit. In fact, when Xapo first announced the card they said using an ATM wouldn't be possible with this card. Absolutely zero shits were given.\n\nBut suddenly they add this optional function that COMPLETELY didn't exist before, and now people call it outrageous. I understand when specifically talking about the fees, it's high. I don't argue with that, I agree with you. But what irks me is that some people (not necessarily you) have used this as an argument to mock the card, say the card and the company is shit. When again, if you couldn't use an ATM nor get expedited shipping, people would've praised this card that is free to make payments.\n\nIt's a cool thing. I don't use it, never will, as I keep both fiat and bitcoin and I'm fine using fiat where I can't use bitcoin. I'm not super thrilled about a card that essentially sells my bitcoin and then makes a normal crappy CC transaction that costs the merchant 3% and has chargeback risks etc. So I don't use the card. But the fees are the LEAST of my worries, I don't give a single shit about the fees as only an extremely rare case, or a complete idiot, or a very rich person would use expedited shipping. It's a one-time thing, it's just not an issue. A fee for a pin-change? It's like they had a fee of $1k for using the creditcard to draw a straight like, I don't give a shit as I never use it. Who cares if the fees are $1 million dollars to change your pin? Not many. And that's the point. I'm not saying the fees aren't ridiculous, I'm saying nobody cares as expedited shipping on a xapo card is not a big deal. ATM fee, sure some people use creditcards at an ATM, that sucks a little bit, but my creditcard is like that, too (same price), and again I can pay in any store and use them as an ATM for free.\n\nSo I agree with you fully, but I don't think it disqualifies or lessens the card much. Only a little bit with the ATM fee. Expedited shipping is just a joke that nobody needs to pay who doesn't want to.

It's an intermediary product.\n\nThe point is that there are people who want to save money in bitcoin, rather than fiat. But those people can only pay at less than 0.1% of merchants. That sucks. So everytime they want to pay they need to sell bitcoin for fiat, then pay. That sucks, too.\n\nSo now you have a card that does it for you automatically, and the use of the card (making a payment) is free.\n\nSo now people can store money in bitcoin, yet use it in their daily lives, too. That's awesome. It's NOT meant to be a better payment system or better creditcard, it's a regular card. It's meant to be a way to connect your bitcoin savings to the rest of the world's businesses that don't yet take bitcoin.\n\nIn 5-10 years, this card will be redundant, you can just use bitcoin directly, and you won't need to pay fees to the card company (which is not Xapo, it's not their creditcard system, they just issue it on their behalf and pass on the fees).\n\nAs for outrageous fees, give me a break. You can pay anywhere for free with this card. Hell you can go to a store and ask if you can get money from them, i.e. buy groceries for $50, then ask for $50 and pay $100, free ATM. The use of the card to make payments is completely free. I've in 20 years literally changed my pin 0 times. \n\nAs for expedited shipping of a card? Nope, never did that, either. It's just such a ridiculous complaint. Expedite ship anything is more expensive, playstation, debitcard, your car. Consider if they offered just regular shipping and no expedited shipping, you wouldn't even be mad. It wouldn't be an issue, as you'd never use it. But now that they do offer it, despite never using it, it's suddenly a complaint that expedited shipping is expensive.

If that were the case, why do they charge an ATM fee, and then further cite an asterisk on their pricing schedule that reads:\n\n\n> "*You may also be charged a fee by the ATM operator or ATM network..."\n\n\n\nLastly, I see what Xapo is trying to do with their card.  And I\'m sympathetic to their efforts.  But I hate to break the news that $3.50 per domestic ATM use, just doesn\'t fly in this day and age.  Unless I misread something:  this means that if one uses their Xapo card once per week at an ATM, that\'s $241/year.  More than anything, this causes me to question the judgement of their executive management.  Take a moment to contrast that fee to my primary debit card.  No fees, ever.  And my account is reimbursed for any ATM operating or network fees incurred anywhere in the world.\n\n\n\nFor that same $241/year Xapo fee (if correct), one could purchase $24,140 worth of bitcoin through an exchange and pay the same fees.  This point is made more salient by the fact that to use Xapo, one must possess the bitcoins already (and therefore have already paid the exchange fee).  To be really cynical, the Xapo card may be considered by some as simply an expensive way to get back into fiat.\n\nXapo should take their group of smart Palo Alto engineers\xe2\x80\x94I know they have them\xe2\x80\x94and go into something with serious potential that\'s also a blast to work on.

What's your point?\n\nAs for a mostly positive influence, I'm truly curious as to how familiar you are with US foreign policy. The US has basically destroyed south america for decades, ruined much of the middle east to this day, and has a pretty ugly history in various states in Africa and Asia. Let me know if you want me to name a few. For example, the CIA overthrow of the democratically elected and secular leadership of Mossadegh in Iran. The support for the corrupt Suharto dictatorship that left nearly a million people dead in decades of corruption, oppression and torture. The US's support for the military coup of general Pinochet who spent his political career a viscous dictator, known for his torture and oppression, with the support of the US, after having removed the democratically elected Allende, with CIA support. The funding of Nicaraguan contras by the US, deemed a violation of international law, the US was sued in the international court of justice and Nicaragua won. The court required the US to pay reparations, so they took their veto power, breaking the politically sacred rules of montesquieu's trias politica, to block the ruling through the UN security council. And that's just a couple smaller ones. Not to even speak of a ridiculous war in Iraq leaving hundreds of thousands of civilians dead, a war fought against a dictator they funded for years, just to leave the region in ruins and let some crazy group like the IS jump into the power vacuum. Or the two-decade war in Vietnam leaving over a million dead.\n\nThe US as a force for good is a complete joke. It's been an opportunist, imperialist force. Its aims have always been in self-interest, and that self-interest has more often than not been at the expense of human dignity all over the world.\n\nAs for your view on WWII... Maybe you've watched too much saving private ryan. I'm glad the US entered the war, too, but to say they defeated Germany, Japan and Italy is foolish. And not to mention the horror of dropping a goddamn nuclear bomb, twice... It's a clear war crime in my opinion. Yes, there are rules and laws to warfare.

The oil would have been priced at market rates, not a fixed number of currency. For example, 1 barrel of oil would have sold for 40 euros, and then post-invasion it would have sold for $50.

Westboro Baptist Church\'s official position could be that they authorized a nuclear attack. Al-Qaeda\'s position could be that they bomb the twin towers. Democratically elected Hamas could bomb Israeli villages. Democratically elected Hezbollah could authorize suicide bombings. All these things happened and everyone recognizes them as terrorism. Just as I recognize a nuclear bomb on civilian cities as such under the circumstances at the time. In fact, historians have a word for this, it\'s called \'state terrorism\' and there are many historians that qualify these bombings (together with e.g. the fire bombings in Dresden or the holocaust) as examples of such state terrorism.\n\nBut if you still disagree, it\'s fine.

Even one life must be carefully considered, 200 thousand civilians, none of us will ever personally shake hands and exchange names with that many people.\n\n> But I\'m not going to rewrite historical truth\n\nLook, I don\'t care if you ignore my entire post again. I don\'t care if you don\'t read my opinion. Just read these quotes from the people in charge at the time (presidents and generals). Starting with the post WWII US President Eisenhower:\n\n> I was against it on two counts. First, the Japanese were ready to surrender, and it wasn\'t necessary to hit them with that awful thing. Second, I hated to see our country be the first to use such a weapon\n\nor\n\n> my belief that Japan was already defeated and that dropping the bomb was completely unnecessary, and secondly because I thought that our country should avoid shocking world opinion by the use of a weapon whose employment was, I thought, no longer mandatory as a measure to save American lives. It was my belief that Japan was, at that very moment, seeking some way to surrender with a minimum loss of \'face\'\n\nDon\'t have to take it from me. A US president saying it was **completely unnecessary**, not mandatory to save American lives, and that the Japanese were seeking surrender. This was by the way echoed by other presidents before and after like Herbert Hoover.\n\nChief of Naval Operations (5-star fleet admiral) :\n\n> "Once it had been tested, President Truman faced the decision as to whether to use it. He did not like the idea, but he was persuaded that it would shorten the war against Japan and save American lives. It is my opinion that the use of this barbarous weapon at Hiroshima and Nagasaki was of no material assistance in our war against Japan. The Japanese were already defeated and ready to surrender because of the effective sea blockade and the successful bombing with conventional weapons... My own feeling was that in being the first to use it, we had adopted an ethical standard common to the barbarians of the Dark Ages. I was not taught to make wars in that fashion, and that wars cannot be won by destroying women and children.\n\nOn the thoughts of MacArthur, Another 5-star general during the WWII (and WWI and Korean War btw)\n\n> When I asked General MacArthur about the decision to drop the bomb, I was surprised to learn he had not even been consulted. What, I asked, would his advice have been? He replied that he saw no military justification for the dropping of the bomb. The war might have ended weeks earlier, he said, if the United States had agreed, as it later did anyway, to the retention of the institution of the emperor."\n\nYou don\'t need me to spell it out for you, do you? The Japanese were willing to surrender on the SAME terms that the US accepted AFTER the Nuclear bombings, weeks and even months BEFORE the nuclear bombs had hit. That\'s the definition of unnecessary.\n\nOr a US study on the reasons for surrender:\n\n> After studying this matter in great detail, the United States Strategic Bombing Survey rejected the notion that Japan gave up because of the atomic bombings. In its authoritative 1946 report, the Survey concluded:\n\n> The Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombs did not defeat Japan, nor by the testimony of the enemy leaders who ended the war did they persuade Japan to accept unconditional surrender. The Emperor, the Lord Privy Seal, the Prime Minister, the Foreign Minister, and the Navy Minister had decided as early as May of 1945 that the war should be ended even if it meant acceptance of defeat on allied terms.\n\n> Based on a detailed investigation of all the facts and supported by the testimony of the surviving Japanese leaders involved, it is the Survey\'s opinion that certainly prior to 31 December 1945 and in all probability prior to 1 November 1945 [the date of the planned American invasion], Japan would have surrendered even if the atomic bombs had not been dropped, even if Russia had not entered the war, and even if no invasion had been planned or contemplated\n\nTextbook definition of unnecessary. As for your note on the obsession with those two cities, I agree completely. I\'m just responding to someone else bringing it up. But indeed, the firebombings on Tokyo were more severe. Guess what? The Japanese agree, whose leadership all said that the Nuclear bombs weren\'t what made them surrender. A final quote on this by historian Palmer Hoyt.\n\n> The fact is that as far as the Japanese militarists were concerned, the atomic bomb was just another weapon. The two atomic bombs at Hiroshima and Nagasaki were icing on the cake, and did not do as much damage as the firebombings of Japanese cities. The B-29 firebombing campaign had brought the destruction of 3,100,000 homes, leaving 15 million people homeless, and killing about a million of them. It was the ruthless firebombing, and Hirohito\'s realization that if necessary the Allies would completely destroy Japan and kill every Japanese to achieve "unconditional surrender" that persuaded him to the decision to end the war. The atomic bomb is indeed a fearsome weapon, but it was not the cause of Japan\'s surrender, even though the myth persists even to this day.': 1, "Enemies of the U.S. have many characteristics in common, and, yes, they probably would all like to topple its dominance as the world reserve currency and petro trade.\n\nI'm not defending the U.S. in all it does, by any means, but this is a silly parallel.": 2, "Lol!!

As for your question on whether Truman was simply bloodthirsty, it's hard for me to say exactly why he did it. I don't like to descend in conspiracy or too much blatant speculation. I absolutely wouldn't say it was blood thirst. I just don't believe there was a consideration for the value of Japanese civilian lives, that's all. Look at the internment camps in the US of US-Japanese civilians. The US did various illegal and racist things, denied it for many years. Later some of the bureas were found guilty in the court, and at one point the US formally apologized for the treatment of these people, admitted grave wrongdoing, racism, prejudice, a national mistake never to be repeated, and paid reparations to each and every individual or heir of more than a billion dollars. Why? Because it was convenient, easy, because the civil and human rights of Japanese didn't count enough quite frankly, and these were mostly AMERICAN Japanese civilians, even people second or third generation born in the US. So imagine the consideration of the lives of civilians in Japan, I doubt there was much. That's not blood thirst, it's just inconsiderate. \n\nAs for why? Well it may have helped end the war sooner, although I doubt the US couldn't have signed for peace before summer's end given all the released reports we now have. But more importantly, it was the first time to test a nuclear bomb. It was a way to show US power to the world. It was a way to completely subjugate Japan, which was very fitting considering they had the same result in Europe. A broken Japan and broken Europe whose industries and factories were destroyed, would receive funding from the US, as part of the Marshal plan. This funding would go straight back to the US to buy American products, as American industry thrived as one of the few countries almost completely untouched by the war, with all of its roads, bridges, harbors and factories running at full speed. It generated huge revenues for US companies, and huge debts of Europe and Japan, which bought the US decades of economic and diplomatic power, allowed it to head every major international institution (of which there was a mass birthing post 1945). Essentially the complete destruction of Japan fit completely within the framework of Europe and Japan losing all its colonial, economic and military power throughout and post WWII and the US jumping into the power vacuum and creating economic and diplomatic ties everywhere. It's why the US was THE 20th century imperialist force.\n\nAny of this is perhaps hard to swallow, hard to believe, the land of freedom and justice to do such a thing, if it hadn't been for the fact they've taken actions in extreme self-interest in almost every place on earth the past century, I named just a few in my previous post. Let alone in the US itself, a history started with the atrocities against Native Americans, built on slave labor, let's not forget when the US dropped these bombs civil rights for black US citizens had a long way to go. And none of it is hard to believe considering every superpower ever has been so cruel. From Genghis Khan (whom one US journalist in 1945 actually compared the US with, after the nuclear bombings), to the arab slave trade, to the atrocities of colonial Europeans, not to mention of course the actions by the Japanese and Germans themselves.

I go into the bank and there\'s 50 people there, and I make them hostages. Then the police arrives outside the bank. I start shooting my gun from inside the bank outside to try to take down police officers. I\'m not willing to surrender, I\'m also still a threat as I\'m shooting out the windows, yet the police force is obviously overwhelming and I have no chance of winning. I will soon be defeated.\n\nDoes it then make sense for the police to throw 50 grenades through the window simultaneously, blowing me up, as well as all 50 innocent customers who I held hostage?\n\nClearly no. Now this is an extreme example that exaggerates various elements very strongly, but I hope you see my point. Which is that nobody has the right to kill innocent civilians on such an insanely disproportionate scale.\n\nRemember that the first bomb killed some 200 thousand people by most estimates (some go up to a quarter million). The cities were chosen (noted by the US Strategic Bombing Survey) for its concentration of activities and population. It was not a military target.\n\nBesides this, it\'s clearly an act of terrorism. That\'s the definition of terrorism. Again straight from the dictionary\n\n> the use of violence and threats to intimidate or coerce, especially for political purposes.\n\nTell me the nuclear bombings of two civilian cities does not qualify?\n\nNow you may argue that terrorism is allowed under circumstances, but every body of international law would disagree.\n\nThe point is that Japan was fighting alone against literally almost the rest of the world, after all of Japan\'s allies had already surrendered, and Japan was militarily dead.\n\nI quote for example:\n\n> Japan already had been defeated militarily by June 1945. Almost nothing was left of the once mighty Imperial Navy, and Japan\'s air force had been all but totally destroyed. Against only token opposition, American war planes ranged at will over the country, and US bombers rained down devastation on her cities, steadily reducing them to rubble.\n\n> What was left of Japan\'s factories and workshops struggled fitfully to turn out weapons and other goods from inadequate raw materials. (Oil supplies had not been available since April.) By July about a quarter of all the houses in Japan had been destroyed, and her transportation system was near collapse. Food had become so scarce that most Japanese were subsisting on a sub-starvation diet.\n\nNote that this all happened months before the actual surrender. Perhaps now you see why I used the example of the lone bank robber with no way out, shooting petty bullets out the window against armored police cars: Japan was in a state of military hopelessness. \n\nTo quote a US airforce general and the Japanese prime minister:\n\n> Henry Arnold, commanding General of the Army air forces, declared in his 1949 memoirs: "It always appeared to us, atomic bomb or no atomic bomb, the Japanese were already on the verge of collapse." This was confirmed by former Japanese prime minister Fumimaro Konoye, who said: "Fundamentally, the thing that brought about the determination to make peace was the prolonged bombing by the B-29s."\n\nJapan was also known to have been seeking a peaceful resolution, knowing the war could not be won, had changed its internal leadership in order to move towards what they knew was an inevitable surrender, and the allies were aware of this.\n\n> Months before the end of the war, Japan\'s leaders recognized that defeat was inevitable. In April 1945 a new government headed by Kantaro Suzuki took office with the mission of ending the war. When Germany capitulated in early May, the Japanese understood that the British and Americans would now direct the full fury of their awesome military power exclusively against them.\n\n> American officials, having long since broken Japan\'s secret codes, knew from intercepted messages that the country\'s leaders were seeking to end the war on terms as favorable as possible. Details of these efforts were known from decoded secret communications between the Foreign Ministry in Tokyo and Japanese diplomats abroad.\n\nMore concretely:\n\n> Although Japanese peace feelers had been sent out as early as September 1944 (and [China\'s] Chiang Kai-shek had been approached regarding surrender possibilities in December 1944), the real effort to end the war began in the spring of 1945. This effort stressed the role of the Soviet Union ...\n\n> In mid-April [1945] the [US] Joint Intelligence Committee reported that Japanese leaders were looking for a way to modify the surrender terms to end the war. The State Department was convinced the Emperor was actively seeking a way to stop the fighting.\n\nAgain, all months before the war did indeed end. Public knowledge of this was kept secret, for example another quote:\n\n> It was only after the war that the American public learned about Japan\'s efforts to bring the conflict to an end. Chicago Tribune reporter Walter Trohan, for example, was obliged by wartime censorship to withhold for seven months one of the most important stories of the war.\n\n> In an article that finally appeared August 19, 1945, on the front pages of the Chicago Tribune and the Washington Times-Herald, Trohan revealed that on January 20, 1945, two days prior to his departure for the Yalta meeting with Stalin and Churchill, President Roosevelt received a 40-page memorandum from General Douglas MacArthur outlining five separate surrender overtures from high-level Japanese officials. (The complete text of Trohan\'s article is in the Winter 1985-86 Journal, pp. 508-512.)\n\nAgain, about 8 months before Japan surrendered, the US president had already received various scenarios for Japan\'s surrender from the Japanese themselves. Perhaps you\'re beginning to see why the death of 200 thousand civilians isn\'t just horrible in and of itself, but even more so as there was a diplomatic solution available, but the US chose to use the lives of 200 thousand civilians as a bargaining chip to speed up or overpower the diplomatic dialogue. \n\nBut even that (using 200 thousand lives as a bargaining chip to overpower the negotiations) wasn\'t necessary, as Japan had already presented terms of a full surrender similar to the one that was eventually accepted by the US, I quote:\n\n> This memo showed that the Japanese were offering surrender terms virtually identical to the ones ultimately accepted by the Americans at the formal surrender ceremony on September 2 -- that is, complete surrender of everything but the person of the Emperor. Specifically, the terms of these peace overtures included:\n\n> Complete surrender of all Japanese forces and arms, at home, on island possessions, and in occupied countries. Occupation of Japan and its possessions by Allied troops under American direction. Japanese relinquishment of all territory seized during the war, as well as Manchuria, Korea and Taiwan. Regulation of Japanese industry to halt production of any weapons and other tools of war. Release of all prisoners of war and internees. Surrender of designated war criminals.\n\nI can go on and on. Now there will be arguments for and against, I appreciate it\'s not a truly 100% black and white issue. But I do firmly believe that despite any hardships and troubles and obstacles that may have been if the US hadn\'t dropped the bombs, that these were well worth not doing the alternative, i.e. taking the lives of 200 thousand civilians. From everything I have read, there is no scenario (where the bombs were not dropped) that resulted in such issues that taking the lives of 200 thousand civilians was the better option.\n\nSaying this, I\'d conclude that it\'s both an act of terrorism, and a highly immoral as well as unnecessary act of violence.\n\n': 2, "Tell me more about this bloody bitcoin revolution that's happening right now.\n\nDid you cut yourself with your paper wallet?": 2, 'It will be peaceful.

It set up a number of things which made dollar usage as an international reserve currency more attractive, but it didn\'t mandate it. Oil, for example, as the video mentions, wasn\'t priced in dollars until Nixon negotiated a couple of deals in the early 1970\'s. Video also states "Bretton Woods set up the dollar as the international reserve currency, which means that commodities were priced in dollars." That statement is inherently false, because the term "international reserve currency" denotes foreign exchange held by central banks. It has nothing to do with commodities.\n\n1:15: "Fed did not allow any auditing of its printing presses." - The Fed doesn\'t print money, Treasury does. Fed distributes. A common misunderstanding, to be fair.\n\n1:45: The reasons behind the demise of the gold-backed dollar are more than just Vietnam war expenditures. Among other causes, other countries were taking advantage of their adjustability vis a vis the gold-dollar and manipulating their currencies, to the detriment of US exports and with that, supplies of gold. However, Vietnam was arguably the biggest cause, so I will say that this particular point isn\'t wrong, but is just lacking nuance. Numerous fixed-rate currencies have failed over the years, the collapse of the gold-dollar is one of the biggest reasons the world went toward floating currencies of today.\n\n2:50: While the video is correct that OPEC adopting the dollar in return for protection led to the creation of the petro-dollar, it also states that "OPEC members would have to have a steady supply of Fed paper." This makes no sense economically. They would receive dollars in return for oil, but there is no inherent reason they\'d have to keep those dollars, as opposed to converting them into anything else they wanted. Granted, given how they run sovereign wealth funds (although I don\'t know if the Middle East had any set up in the mid-70s) and central banks with reserves, they\'d probably want to, but video implies that they had no choice. They obviously did.\n\n3:05: "largest financial con in recorded history" lolok.\n\n3:15: Video takes a leap from saying "OPEC needed to buy dollars" (which again doesn\'t make sense) to saying "as a result the US got fabulously rich." That\'s a very questionable claim, especially considering the stagflation and "economic malaise" that characterized the very decade the video is talking about. But maybe he\'s hopping forward in time ten years, and ignoring the shit growth that the US had during the time it was apparently getting fabulously rich by having OPEC - who, by the way, was obviously best friends with the US at the time - pay for things in dollars. Further, most economists will tell you that the US was already fabulously rich - in no small part due to its position post-WWII, but also because of the rise in international trade we call globalization in the 80s. Japanese, and then Chinese, export-led growth fueled a massive demand for US dollars - leaving OPEC aside. But this post is getting long already.\n\n4:10: "US invaded Iraq" interesting way to frame that. Most people would refer to that as the liberation of Kuwait. If the US\'s intention was to destroy or conquer Iraq (for reasons the video doesn\'t talk about, at all, which is interesting) then one would have expected coalition troops to march to Baghdad, which they easily could have done, but didn\'t. The sanctions were intended to stop Saddam from continuing to gas the Kurds, among other things. They obviously had limited effect, and while estimates of the numbers killed by them vary, video (as usual) tends to the hyperbolic end of the estimates.\n\n5:10: Iraq started selling its oil in Euros because the EU wasn\'t party to the Iraq sanctions. Any transaction involving dollars would also involve converting dollars to another currency, which was illegal under the US sanctions regime (same logic is how BNP Paribas got fucked earlier this year, and also why Lawsky exists, but I digress). This wasn\'t a "threat to the Petrodollar system," it was an economic way of avoiding US-led sanctions.\n\n5:25: Idiot time. Oil sales were converted back into dollars because the US was running the oil fields, and they were selling the oil directly. There were no more sanctions prohibiting the sale of Iraqi oil in dollars. Why wouldn\'t they use dollars? Further, video states that "this resulted in a loss in revenue of 15-20% due to the Euro\'s higher value." That\'s nonsense. The oil would have been priced at market rates, not a fixed number of currency. For example, 1 barrel of oil would have sold for 40 euros, and then post-invasion it would have sold for $50. That\'s not a loss in revenue of 20% (unless you\'re an idiot and just comparing 40 to 50), it\'s a change in pricing due to the currency you\'re using.\n\n6:30: video pretends like US forces attacked Libya and overthrew Gaddafi. That\'s nonsense, not only because it misunderstands history (at the time of intervention, Gaddafi\'s government was falling apart, various ministers and cabinet officials resigned, numerous generals defected, rebels controlled multiple key cities and regions, and the fucking Arab League - hardly friends of the US - requested foreign intervention from the UN) but also because the US was minimally involved in the attacks. France ran the show for about a month, followed by a primarily-EU coalition, followed by NATO after the heavy fighting had already taken place. NATO\'s role was primarily to run a no-fly zone.\n\nI\'m tired of typing this up, but from 6:30, you have multiple, multiple points of disagreement with the facts from this hyperbolic video.

You are told up front what the money will be used for (expanding Hubi's mining operations) and how they will pay you back (using bitcoins mined by Houbi's existing mining operation.) You can see the address where the new mined coins are being deposited. It seems to produce an average of 35 coins per day. That means the mining operation can produce more than enough coins to pay back the 2000 invested coins and interests in 60 days. So the risk is actually very low.\n\n3.

So you\'d see the transaction before you tap your tag to produce the second signature.  I suppose your wallet app could "go rogue" [and there are some potential solutions here too], but, like you pointed out, it requires a more sophisticated attack since one of the keys are permanently offline.\n\nFor brevity, I kept the video as simple as possible.  But through the NFC APDU interface, users can load their own private keys, set passwords, require cryptographic authentication from the wallet app (check an ECDSA signature), lock the "spend address", set per "tap" or daily spend limits (this requires the optional battery), etc.  I discuss this in more detail in the white paper. \n\nThe challenge though is coming up with a simple "pitch" for how this could very easily be integrated with the popular wallets.  What\'s the simplest but still useful realization of this technology?  \n\nMy answer is "a second signer" for a multisig wallet.  Integrating this into existing apps should not be too difficult:\n\n- To initially create the multisig address, the app would request the user tap his tag to the phone and the app would read the pubkey (which it would then use together with one of its own keys to create a P2SH multisig address).\n\n- To transfer funds from the multisig address, upon user acknowledgement the wallet app would sign the TX, and then pass the TX to the sigSafe to get the second signature.  The user "taps" his tag to sign.\n\nThere\'s *lots* of additional cool things you could do later to improve both useability and security, but I think it\'s nice to start out with something very simple. \n': 11, 'RT_M :) (or "RT_WP"?)': 1, 'It\'s immune to key-loggers (e.g., when used with your computer).\n\nIt\'s immune to wallet.dat stealers (since your important private keys are offline).\n\nIt\'s resistant to attacks on the sigsafe supply chain or poor random seed selection (since the other seed is generated by an independent party).    \n\nIt\'s resistant to man-in-the-middle attacks (see below).\n\nRegarding signing rogue TXs, I avoided too many details in the video (it\'s described in the white paper), but the device will only sign transactions authorized by its "signing rules." For example, the device can set "per tap" spend limits (or daily spend limits with the optional battery), verify an ECDSA signature (to reduce the threat of a MITM attack), check a PIN, etc.\n\nConsider this scenario: My tag is configured to only sign up to 1 BTC "per tap." In the (IMO very) unlikely event that my wallet app "goes rogue" and remains undetected through several "day-to-day" transactions (even though it *could* just steal the online funds) until the moment that I\'m about to transfer from my sigsafe, then modifies the TX in an undetected way, authenticates successfully with the sigSafe, and then I sign the rogue TX by tapping, the damage is sill limited to the per-tap spend limit. The attack must occur in the brief moment when your tag is in contact with the NFC reader and would be very difficult to execute.\n\nThere\'s no perfect security and there\'s certainly benefits to having a screen, buttons, etc. But we should also weigh probability of loss versus the cost and complexity of the security solution. I think a device like this is simple to use, low cost, and reduces the attack surface significantly.\n\nThat being said, I\'d still like to make a more expensive version with a screen and capacitive touch sensor :)\n\n': 3, 'I think you are definitely on to something here.': 2, 'Wow, I wake up and see the video I posted to bitcointalk.org late last night has already been viewed 434 times.

Your phone (or computer) would create (and display) the transaction, sign it with its private key, and then request that you "tap" your sigSafe tag to produce the second signature (which is signed internally within the sigSafe tag and then relayed over NFC back to the phone).
