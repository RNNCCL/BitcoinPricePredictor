That, coupled with the fact that there's no hard cap on transaction fees that could be charged by the miners, ultimately the cap becomes how much the market will tolerate in fees compared to competition, say the traditional financial networks. \n\nThis issue will only be exacerbated by stronger bitcoin adoption when demand for transactions would only increase. \n\nThe dilemma bitcoin seems to face is, making sure fees are so low that it's a no brainer to switch to it from the traditional system which comes at the cost of more resources required and eventually more centralization. \n\nI don't know if this makes sense to you, but I just wanted to clarify what I meant by inflationary maintenance costs since you said you don't know how I think the system works. ": 1, "It's the users that set the fees.\n\nLet's assume there will be multiple miners, because if there isn't then bitcoin has bigger problems that what the fees will be.\n\nWith multiple miners competing, some or all of them will include every transaction that pays more money than it costs to include in the block \xe2\x80\x94 the cost of mining the block doesn't factor into that decision. To leave paying transactions on the table is throwing away money, worse \xe2\x80\x94 you're giving that money to competing miners. This should keep the fees low. Alternately, if the desired block size is smaller than the number of transactions then the highest\xe2\x80\x90fee transactions are picked first, but in neither case is the rational decision affected by what it cost to mine the block.\n\nIf *every* miner colludes to raise prices then your scenario might happen (only one would have to dissent to pick up all the money the other miners would be leaving on the table), but bitcoin offers little value if it can be centrally controlled, so collusion risks destroying the income the miners depend on to pay off their huge capital investments, and driving up prices would also risk destroying the system the miners need to pay off their huge capital investments. People aren't always smart so I can't say it can't happen \xe2\x80\x94 bitcoin is still an experiment, but it seems far from inevitable.\n\n> making sure fees are so low that it's a no brainer to switch to it from the traditional system which comes at the *cost of more resources required and eventually more centralization*. \n\nI'm still not sure what this means, why does keeping low fees mean more resources and centralization?

I suggest more reading about bitcoin before drawing conclusions about long term problems.\n\nThe system's maintenenance cost stays below the blockreward+fees because individual miners stop mining when they can't make a profit, which causes blocks to take longer than 10 mins to be found, which causes the mining difficulty to adjust downward, which makes it more profitable for the remaining miners. Being profitable is the cap on the costs of minting and processing transactions.\n\nThe transaction fees are buying security, so [once the blockreward fades away] the network gets stronger/weaker in proportion to the number of people using it and paying transactions fees.": 1, "> which comes at the cost of more resources required and eventually more centralization.\n\nWhat I mean by that is this: \n\nAssuming that the bitcoin miners are working at full capacity, my belief is that the system will continue to raise difficulty which will require more resources (better equipment, more electricity, etc.) by miners. Theoretically, difficulty is supposed to go down, but the big miners have invested a lot of capital and the gap between the power of soloists/hobbyists and smaller businesses versus the big players will keep getting bigger. A big player going belly up may temporarily reduce difficulty, but it\xe2\x80\x99ll also create a power vacuum most likely to be filled disproportionately by the biggest players that survived. I doubt there would be any smart investors willing to put money down to enter the mining business now. It\xe2\x80\x99s not profitable.

When you wish to transfer money from say BTC to USD or Euro's etc (and vice versa), it would be immensely helpful if it displayed the current price of 1 BTC in the default currency of the account-holder/user or in the currency of the currency-card being transferred to. If your making a quick trade based on current prices you haven't got the time to be working out the current exchange rate, and as the prices fluctuate from second to second you often need to act in the moment as the price changes.\n\nThis also highlights the other related issue, is that when you enter a value to transfer to another card or make a payment, it gives you the current value from the point when you entered that screen/window, but it doesn't update from then on. Say you enter a transfer of 1 BTC to USD, it will display the conversion rate, but if you pause for say 30seconds, or delete that value and enter a different one, it will still display the same rate of conversion, despite the fact that the conversion rate has actually changed. If you exit back out of that screen and then go back in again, it will then display an updated conversion rate, but it will not display a live rate on the screen (just the conversion rate when you entered onto that screen/window). Basically it needs to keep checking the current rate of exchange and updating this in real-time on the payment screen. Without this feature it heavily limits the usability, and generally you need to have a computer to hand to keep track of current prices etc. which defeats most of the point of having a mobile app.\n\nHope I explained this in a clear enough manner, but if this ability was added to the app. it would be pretty much a perfect app. I think, as all else is well laid out and very user-friendly.\n\nThanks": 2, "Hi!\n\nI just downloaded your app.\nHere is what I would like:\n- the ability to make a selection of which cards to show.

As in the current price of 1 BTC in USD, Euros etc... the lack of this function makes using this as a standalone phone application much more complicated, particularly if you are making a transaction based on trade values.\n\nAdditionally, the process of transferring between your own cards is far too slow and long winded. Why do you have to request a payment, copy the hash address of the card and then enter that into the card you want to transfer to. You should merely need to select the card you want to transfer to and the amount to transfer, the same way as it works on the Uphold website. Copying and pasting addresses on a phone is fiddly, it's also more likely that you could paste an incorrect address, or accidently modify the address after pasting. They're basically internal payments and transfers within your own account, so even if the hash/address is required, the application could easily access them automatically when you select which cards to transfer between.": 2, "The main problem to me is that there seems to be a security issue for using this application. There is no way to sign out, once logged in your balance is permanently accessible, if someone gained access to your phone or discovered your phones pin code then they would have full access to your funds and be able to send them off to whatever bitcoin address they liked in seconds. Also if your phone was hacked into remotely, what's to stop someone accessing this application and stealing your money? After all, it's permanently accessible with no requirement or security integrated into payments, you simply enter a hash/address and thee money goes out your account.

Bitreserve allows the value to be held in bitcoin, USD, CHF Gold etc which is a good way to manage risk and volatility, and it is completely integrated with Bitwage.  Xapo is also integrated, and they issue a debit card.  This approach is cheaper than my current bank (UBS, current employer of Phil Gramm, ["the Forrest Gump of financial calamity"](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/02/25/sequester-phil-gramm_n_2760231.html)).

Hopefully the two-week "grace period" will allow the fork to be resolved thoroughly enough that this will be negligible, though.': 1, "If you look at anarcho-capitilist literature, or even anarcho-communist literature - or even social ecology literature - the likes of say murray bookchin - you will find that historically democracy was from the bottom-up, and formed larger, but less powerful confederacies the more central the planning. Yet with the Bitcoin Foundation, the only thing that is decentralized is the programming - there is nothing decentralized about the programmers or how things are coded, or how it is even run as an institution.  Capitalist corporations are likely way more democratic and transparent than what i have surveyed of the Bitcoin Foundation. Am i wrong? I think bitcoin should  adopt a scholar of decentralized political societies onboard, if it wishes to somehow surpass the vices of capitist society, to put its money where its mouth is so to speak. And that's likely just a start. The human element in the bitcoin foundation's decentralization seems to be completely absent.

Think about it: the most pressing problems would have the biggest bounties, and thus would get done the fastest. The reward would go to anyone who could prove that they solved the problem and honestly earned the bounty. The "investors" would each judge whether or not the problem was solved and own a percentage of the resulting solution, *in proportion* to their share of the total investment, but they wouldn\'t get to have the solution unless they deemed it successful, so investors would be incentivized to actually pay up. I think this is the optimal system of goverment. ': 1, 'As soon as there is a split in the blocks, that will really mean there are two different kinds of Bitcoins.  It is really that simple.\n\nPeople with stuff in the "old Bitcoins" can likely conduct transactions in either of the forks, but it will be double spending in those cases... so far as each separate fork is really now a new currency.\n\nIMHO "the market" will ultimately decide which version is going to be more valuable, as there will definitely be some differences in the exchange rate between those two forks and other currencies.  One of them is going to become valuable, and the other will be worthless... over time.

You don\'t seem capable of detaching consensus over protocol rules from consensus over the blockchain state. It\'s the reason why we\'re worried about a 51% attack to begin with; we don\'t want a majority of computing power to influence the network governance.\n\nEssentially what you\'re advocating is for there to be a slim majority (perhaps just a few pools) which coerces the minority into changing the protocol or behavior of the network. It is impossible to detach that from an attack on the network, yet it\'s the exact description of what you claim is the "underlying principle". In order to achieve certainty and faith in the currency we need a process that decreases the threat of hostile action by collaborating miners.\n\nThat means everyone should play their part and not contribute to a plan which doesn\'t require near-unanimous consensus.': 2, 'Not so if the "fork" is open-source.
