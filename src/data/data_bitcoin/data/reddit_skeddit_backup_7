That site tells you if the word list is valid or not, by verifying the checksum, I assume using Javascript.\n\nIf I were doing serious checks on my own seed and cared about its safety, I would obviously NOT be entering my seed on a website.  But for just quick testing, it\'s fine to use.  For safe offline verification, there\'s plenty of other apps or you could probably even just save that website for offline use.  I personally have Python scripts I\'ve written to implement BIP39, so I would use those, but there\'s many open source implementations to choose from.\n\nAnyway, I plugged in words close to "done" -- dome, dose, etc. -- and quickly found that "dose" made the word list have a valid checksum, and figured it was likely that that was your seed.
