That way, a bitcoin user will have easy and immediate access to a reasonably small sum of their bitcoin without a bank being involved at all, and the rest of their bitcoin timelocked let's say for two years.\n\nWith a hardware wallet such as that there would be no point in burglarizing peoples homes, physically forcing them to transfer all of their bitcoin in one large transaction to the robber. Also, the bitcoin would still be in total control by the hardware wallet owner in case the bank would go bankrupt or refuse to co-sign a large transaction.\n\nThe worst case scenario would be that the hardware wallet owner would have to wait two years to be able to access all of their funds.

Mindboggling.\n\nI own both bitcoin certificates (The "Bitcoin Tracker One" ETN certificate from XBT Provider) and actual bitcoin. The reason I\'ve chosen to own both is to hedge against the risk of me making one of two mistakes:\n\n1. Failing at computer security which results in a hacker steals my cold storage bitcoin somehow.\n2. Failing at creating a proper cold storage solution so that it turns out to be impossible to turn my cold wallet into a hot wallet.\n\nI\'m just spreading the risk. I don\'t own solely bitcoin certificates, because the corporation that holds the actual bitcoin on my behalf, may lose them just as well as I may lose them. I\'m just keeping my eggs in at least two baskets, so to speak.\n\nYes, I lost the bitcoin that I stored on Mtgox. But that was an acceptable and conscious risk that I took. It may as well had turned out that Mtgox would still be alive and well, but that I lost my own actual bitcoin in my own cold storage. How would that be possible? Well,\n\n1) A simple and unexpected reason at the time, could\'ve been a loss due to the Bitcoin Core wallet storing only 100 pregenerated addresses. Some people lost a lot of coins simply because they didn\'t know about this limitation that in effect rendered their cold wallet backup irrecoverable, thus making their bitcoin unaccessible forever for everyone.\n\n2) There has been critical problems with random number generators that in retrospect turned out to be not particularly and sufficiently random (Blockchain.info bug and Android bug for example), causing the bitcoin owner to lose their bitcoin whose private keys were generated by such a defective random number generator.\n\nAs you can see, it\'s perfectly possible to lose your coins even if you are in personal control of every aspect of their storage. In my opinion it therefore makes sense to spread the risk by also outsourcing the storage and security of your coins to third parties such as Mtgox and ETFs / ETNs.
