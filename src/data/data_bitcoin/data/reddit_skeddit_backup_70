Energy efficiency is an urgent priority \xe2\x80\x94 especially for the embedded smart sensors that comprise the \'Internet of things\', which will need new technology to survive without batteries, using energy scavenged from ambient heat and vibration. Connectivity is equally key: billions of free-roaming devices trying to communicate with one another and the cloud will need huge amounts of bandwidth, which they can get if researchers can tap the once-unreachable terahertz band lying deep in the infrared spectrum. And security is crucial \xe2\x80\x94 the report calls for research into new ways to build in safeguards against cyberattack and data theft.\n\n> These priorities and others will give researchers plenty to work on in coming years. At least some industry insiders, including Shekhar Borkar, head of Intel\'s advanced microprocessor research, are optimists. Yes, he says, Moore\'s law is coming to an end in a literal sense, because the exponential growth in transistor count cannot continue. But from the consumer perspective, \xe2\x80\x9cMoore\'s law simply states that user value doubles every two years\xe2\x80\x9d. And in that form, the law will continue as long as the industry can keep stuffing its devices with new functionality.\n\n.\n\n[[Agner Fog] Moore\'s Law Hits the Roof](http://www.agner.org/optimize/blog/read.php?i=417)\n\n> Through the last 40 years we have seen the speed of computers growing exponentially. Today\'s computers have a clock frequency a thousand times higher than the first personal computers in the early 1980\'s. The amount of RAM memory on a computer has increased by a factor ten thousand, and the hard disk capacity has increased more than a hundred thousand times. We have become so used to this continued growth that we almost consider it a law of nature, which we are calling Moore\'s law. But there are limits to growth, which Gordon Moore himself also points out. We are now approaching the physical limit where computing speed is limited by the size of an atom and the speed of light.\n>\n> Intel\'s iconic Tick-Tock clock has begun to skip a beat now and then. Every Tick is a shrinking of the transistor size, and every Tock is an improvement of the microarchitecture. The current processor generation called Skylake is a Tock with a 14 nanometer process. The next in sequence would logically be a Tick with a 10 nanometer process, but Intel is now putting "refresh cycles" after the tocks. The next processor, announced for 2016, will be a refresh of the Skylake, still with a 14 nanometer process. This slowdown of the Tick-Tock clock is a physical necessity, because we are approching the limit where a transistor is only a few atoms wide (a silicon atom is 0.2 nanometers).\n\n.\n\n[[IEEE] The Status of Moore\'s Law: It\'s Complicated](http://spectrum.ieee.org/semiconductors/devices/the-status-of-moores-law-its-complicated)\n\n> Many people in the industry, who have watched showstopper after showstopper crop up only to be bypassed by a new development, are reluctant to put a hard date on Moore\xe2\x80\x99s Law\xe2\x80\x99s demise. \xe2\x80\x9cEvery generation, there are people who will say we\xe2\x80\x99re coming to the end of the shrink,\xe2\x80\x9d says ASML\xe2\x80\x99s Arnold, and in \xe2\x80\x9cevery generation various improvements do come about.

Some people believe this is wrong, too. They state that you cannot have a blockchain in banking without a native currency\xe2\x80\x94and why would you replace bitcoin as the native currency when it's had five years and thousands of man hours of development effort invested? It's an interesting discussion, and one I disagree with personally as you can have a dollarchain or eurochain, rather than a bitcoin blockchain, but only time will tell on this one.\n\nIt is important to understand that SWIFT does not represent a settlement layer. All SWIFT is is a network for communicating financial transactions between banks internationally. \n\nThe settlement layer in the legacy banking system is always central banks. That is, the exchange of government money, whether that be cash handed to a homeless person on the street or Federal Reserve deposits exchanged between banks, represents final settlement. If you have cash in your hand, that is real money. \n\nWhen two domestic banks need to settle with one another, that settlement ultimately takes place through a simple transfer of money between the respective banks' accounts at the central bank. This transaction is the equivalent of transferring bitcoins in the Bitcoin monetary system. \n\nIn the United States, most banks use CHIPS (Clearing House Interbank Payment System) to settle between one another in a way that is less cumbersome than using the Fed for every transaction. It is functionally similar to a system like the Lightening Network. That is, using CHIPS they add up all of their transactions and then only at the end of the day do they commit a final settlement at the Fed. This way the Fed can be the backbone for a tremendous number of transactions without that much government money actually moving around.\n\nWhen international payments are made, what happens is that a communication network like SWIFT is used, primarily for its security, to communicate between two independent monetary systems. Then each system settles independently. That is to say, if you want to send money to China, simplistically speaking, the Fed deposits dollars into some Chinese account at the Fed and then the Chinese deposit Yuan into some US account at the PBoC independently. The communication between the two banks is facilitated by SWIFT. Put simply, no actual money is transferred through SWIFT, simply a communication telling the two central banks who is owed what. I guess you could call SWIFT a kind of payment network.\n\nSo the only reason you need a network like SWIFT is because there is no final global settlement layer. There is no global currency. The reason we even have global reserve currencies, like the US dollar, is because we don't have a global settlement layer so some central banks ends up acting more or less as such out of necessity. Right now it is the Fed. This creates demand for the US dollar and a rise in its value far beyond what it would be without this status. \n\nThe problem with saying blockchain technology is going to replace a communication network like SWIFT is that blockchains are *not* payment networks, they are settlement networks, they are money. Therefore, blockchains replace the role currently filled by central banks. \n\nIf you have a blockchain that transfers value using US dollars, Fedcoin as it were, that blockchain would effectively replace the clearing house role currently played by the Fed. But nothing has changed with regard to international settlement. You still need to communicate between the closed system represented by Fedcoin and the closed system represented by some other blockchain, say Yuancoin. This isn't to say that SWIFT won't be replaced, we all know it will, but rather that you are still going to have to find a way of communicating between national blockchains, the problem SWIFT is meant to solve will still persist. \n\nThat is unless you have one blockchain to rule them all. That is unless you have a global currency. But why would nations settle on that global currency being one of their competitors' national currency? Why would they agree to let the global currency be a national currency whose monetary policies are aimed ultimately at prioritizing their interests over all others? The world tolerates reserve currencies today because it has no choice. But in the age of cryptocurrency, global currencies become a reality. \n\nSo the question of whether Bitcoin, or any blockchain for that matter, will replace SWIFT is really a question of whether the world will accept a global currency. If so, then all settlement will take place through its blockchain and the need for an international financial communication network will disappear. But why should the world accept such a global blockchain that is controlled by one nation, or worse, by a cabal of international bankers? Will everyone all over the planet simply submit to a global currency controlled by the super elite when there is an alternative controlled by no one?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  ": 20, "I appreciate the trash analogy, but with Moore's Law and ever increasing computer power and storage capacity, doesn't this at least contribute to solving the problem?\n\ne:  In addition, why not a dynamic block size limit based on historical capacity, that way we're not always pushing for hard-forks.": 6, '> It should not be confused with the former.\n\nNo, it does the same job and is better.': -1, 'It is better?

So then if Alice wants to pay Frank (A---F), F sends out his identifying address registered with the 3rd party or node, so that identifying address can then be used to find other payment channels open with F.\n\nAnyway, some kind of channel ownership mechanism may be needed and I'm wondering if this can be done without loss of privacy.

But I think you\'re looking at the 1000 -> 2016 change slightly wrong. It\'s not really the accuracy that you need to pay attention to, but the chance of variance (luck) changing the outcome of the vote. The change has two effects:\n\n1) Taking the average over 2016 blocks instead of 1000 blocks. Yes that increases the "accuracy" which also means that in the old situation variance had a bigger impact.\n\n2) Sampling only once in the window instead of checking every block in the window. Again here: in the old situation variance had a bigger impact.\n\nSo both effects actually reduce the impact of variance. Both effects add up, they don\'t compensate. \n\nIn short 95% in the new situation really means 95%. While in the old situation you could say that 95% actually meant 90% plus a little variance (which was certain to hit +5% eventually) and people knew that so that\'s why they set it to 95% in the first place even though they were aiming for 90%. (All number out of my ass, I\'d expect the difference to be smaller too.)\n\nWell, I wouldn\'t call stating that one is a little concerned about X, to be a discussion about reducing X.

Even if someone couldn't wrap his head around how to pay a slightly larger fee manually, several wallets can do it for him. \n\nThe testnet fork didn't require much discussion because the problem was easily discovered and fixed.

Feefilter minimizes that waste.\n\nIt wasn't as important in the past because the minimum relay fee was hardcoded, but now that its dynamic it's slightly less consistent between peers. (And people DOS attacking the network, of course, send transactions right at the threshold, so it makes a bigger traffic difference than you might guess).": 3, "In order to try to preserve that, but still try to satisfy the demand for improved information availability for outsiders, why not have the website perform the same function and be non-official? Where people involved with Core can still acknowledge the truth value of the information reported on there, but it's not presented as some kind of official centralized word for the project. This model also opens the door for multiple communication channels with similar methods of presenting information. As long as there's some way for contributors from the project to acknowledge the truth of the information being reported, or lack thereof, it could still result in a similar level of decentralization as before.\n\nAt the end of the day, the way I see it is the only official centralized word that the project can offer is the code that gets merged and then released. But people also desire easy access to true information, and as we can see now, the proliferation of false information has become an obvious problem I think judging my many of the untruths that have been flowing around the community for the last while. So far I think the Bitcoin Core website has been done well and added value. But I also see your concerns about having a centralized information source like that. So maybe instead of stopping there people can continue to think of ideas to both increase the flow of true information, while progressively moving back to a more decentralized model.

Currently if a node receives a transaction whose fee is below that node's configurable minimum relay fee, the node simply doesn't add the transaction to its memory pool; after feefilter is implemented, the transmitting node won't send the transaction to the receiving node in the first place, so the ultimate effect is the same in both cases: the receiving node doesn't add the transaction to its memory pool.\n\nRegarding CPFP: the parent transaction will still have to pay a high enough fee to ensure it gets added to memory pools.  Only then can a child transaction be created that pays extra fee to cover the confirmation of both.\n\nAlthough this may sound like a problem, it probably isn't.  There are two usual ways customers notify their merchants that they paid:\n\n1. By broadcasting a transaction to the P2P network and waiting for it to propagate until it reaches the merchant's wallet.  This is used for most payments made to a P2PKH or P2SH address\n2. Giving the transaction directly to the merchant (for example using the BIP70 payment protocol) \n\nFor the first method, if nodes reject the parent transaction, it won't propagate and the merchant will never hear about it.  If the merchant doesn't know about the transaction, it can't create a child payment any way.\n\nFor the second method, the merchant will be able to instantly discover that it pays too low a fee and reject it, preventing it from being sent to the network at all.\n\nIn both cases, if nodes reject the parent transaction or don't hear about it in the first place, then it can be recreated with a higher fee.  Opt-In Replace By Fee (RBF) isn't even needed for this because nothing is being replaced (the original was rejected) so it works perfectly right now.  (The only complication is that some user wallets won't let you recreate a transaction that spends the same inputs; that's annoying.)": 7, 'It could go both ways.

That said, I believe by the time the BIP65 (CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY) soft fork was ready for enforcement, over 99% of the last 1,000 blocks were signalling readiness; future versionbit soft forks that are that far over the threshold should have have no problem getting enforced.": 8, 'I\'d hope it would be roughly around what your mempool considers the min mempool fee.

The prior threshold was as high as it was in part due to an attempt to mitigate false triggering under the old mechanism.\n\nBut 95% in general sounds reasonable; I think the community around core would prefer 100% over some analysis window except that because there is no general way to track down or contact people a single small forgotten unupgraded mining node might prevent activation for a long time without any intention of its owner.\n\nDue to the design of BIP9 warnings it's generally easier to lower the threshold later than raise it; so it makes sense to deploy with a higher criteria, even if its excessive, and revise it down for future soft-forks it turns out to be too problematic (e.g. if it misses multiple opportunities even with ~95% support and unduly delays an activation for no obviously good reason).\n\nThe rapid activation of the last couple 95% softforks suggests that even the new higher BIP9 criteria is not obviously unrealistic; but at the same time I also wouldn't be surprised if there are some delays on account of it.

So your question would perhaps better be poised as does dynamic minfee break CPFP.  The answer looks like no, at least right now-- the mempool size is HUGE (300 blocks worth) and so the minfee is very low indeed.  It\'s true that a transaction that paid so low as to fail the minfee wouldn\'t be rescued by CPFP, but to end up there they\'d have to have an awfully low fee. There is a lot of benefit to be had from CPFP without considering those transactions.\n\nIn the long run, we have a general idea how to avoid that limitation: To avoid it, we would support relaying "transaction packages" and not just single transactions. With package relay, you could tell peers that you want to know about collections of related transactions whos aggregate passes your limits.

I think he gave us a pretty good hint what bitcoin is about in the genesis block message.\n\nAre you ? I think he gave us a pretty good hint about what bitcoin is about by calling his founding white paper "Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System". Maybe you have heard of it ?  \n\n>Bitcoin is simply not ready for mass adoption yet. I\'m sorry if that doesn\'t suit your desire to get rich quick. This is a long ride. You need to be a bit patient.\n\nSays who ? Why not let it continue to grow like it has always grown so far ? I\'m already quite wealthy thank you for your concern. I\'ve been riding this train since 2011. I am very patient but I\'m concerned by the direction taken by core and I\'m not afraid of speaking my mind.  \n\n> Because it doesn\'t make sense from an information theory standpoint. And what is your response for the very simple fact that waiting for blockchain confirmation times when buying a cup of coffee makes no sense anyway?\n\nI\'ve bought a LOT of things with bitcoin over the last years and have almost never waited for a confirmation time, thanks to smart payment providers and 0 conf transcations. I\'ve been able to enjoy worldwide instantanous free payments and I\'d hate that to stop. Sure it makes less sens for going to starbuck but apparently this and micro transactions are the only use you see in Bitcoin payments.  \n\n> No you won\'t. Someone has to always have a copy of the entire ledger. That\'s just how it works. Maybe this is the most important reason why we have such a difference in opinion? Please study this issue a bit more. I have never heard any developer say that someone wouldn\'t have store the entire blockchain for bitcoin to work.\n\nSomeone has to, but not everybody. YOU DONT NEED A FULL NODE TO USE BITCOIN. Ever heard of SPV wallets ?  \nIf I need to accept 1M$ payments, I will run a full node with professionnal standards, if I need 200\xe2\x82\xac on my phone, I will use a SPV wallet and take the risk.

If the only ones capable of running full nodes are big financial institutions, then it's not peer to peer money anymore.

I understand that there is a small cost that I do need to accept in order to have decentralized, inflation-free, censorship resistant money. Would I like things to be free? Yes. Are there free services in the real world? Not really.\n\nIt doesn't matter to you now, but would you have been sold on Bitcoin if you were told fees could increase 10 fold when the system will be successfull. It doesn't sound like a great scalling system.  \nFees are artificially increased and this is not a good thing for adoption. Decentralization only happens because there are some use cases beyond store of value.  \n\n> It's simply not secure though. You do 0 conf at your own detriment.\n\nOnce again, depends on your usage. It's secure ENOUGH for lots of use cases. You do 0 conf at sellers risks. If they are willing to take the risk, where is the problem ?  \nRemoving entirely use cases because they don't fit your understanding of what Bitcoin should be is a huge mistake.  \n\n> Where do you get 60k/sec?\n\nPersonnaly I get 100Mo optic fiber for 30\xe2\x82\xac / m in France but let's have a look at the situation world wide cause I know I'm in a great situation here : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_Internet_connection_speeds  \nOups, It looks like a lot of third world countries could easily handle 2Mo blocks even with Luke's over the top metrics...": 1, "Sure but in your first case, legitimate users also pay 10* the fees of the second case.  \nUse cases are not limited to microtransactions. 0 conf is possible and happening as we speak.  \nAgain, depends on what you need it for. If this is so crucial for your use but you can't afford 60k/s upload bandwidth, then you do have a problem (that money solves easily) but that doesn't apply to the majority of nodes.": 1, "On the contrary, the core developers don't want to make hasty and rushed changes to bitcoin just because of some social pressure on Reddit.
