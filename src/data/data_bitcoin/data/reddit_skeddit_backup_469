Banks like to do business with people who provide them profit, and doing business with poor people is less profitable than with non-poor people. Banks only have so much capital and time to spend on profit-generation, so they put it where it makes the best return, which is not poor people.\n\nAs a result poor people tend to use cash more than others. They pay check-cashing companies and take cash, then spend it immediately.

": 21, "In our modern monetary system, bank credit and cash are analogous to the relationship between banknotes and gold a hundred year ago. That is to say, bank credit is backed by cash, every unit of bank credit can be traded in for a unit of cash (that is what it means to withdrawal money from the bank). Since central banks creates cash, and since cash is the underlying trusted form of money upon which all trust in the bank credit system depends, people understandably believe central banks are the primary creators of money in the financial system, yet over 95% of all the money in existence is in the form of bank credit which is created by private banks. \n\nCommercial banks can issue as much bank credit as they want, since all bank credit really means is that the bank owes you the said amount in cash. If the bank credits your account 100 dollars, it means the bank owes you 100 dollars in cash. Banks are inadvertently creating money when they credit bank accounts because over time the system has come to consider bank credit just as good as cash. But the whole thing depends on the idea that bank credit ultimately is a promise to pay cash, and since cash can only be created by central banks, this relationship is what allows central banks to control the value and supply of money in a given society. \n\nOf course, this relationship is about to end, as cash is all but a joke in modern societies where everyone uses credit cards, and central banks don't even bother to print most of the money they lend to private banks anymore (the private banks just accept central bank credit as being as good as cash). Central bank credit (i.e., cash) is almost free these days and everyone is talking about the end of cash as a very real thing. \n\nBut what happens if we get rid of cash? Well it means that bank credit becomes base money, which means it shifts from simply being a promise to pay base money into actual base money itself and therefore private banks remove the power over currency currently reserved for central banks and government and assume that power for themselves. It would be as if they suddenly had the power to create gold (back when gold was money). There is nothing stopping them from simply giving themselves all the money they want and buying everything in sight, destroying the currency and the economy with it. (Yes, I understand it is almost that bad already.) \n\nNo, if bank credit becomes base money, then governments and central banks will have no choice but to essentially nationalize the banking system, or something along the lines of making the central bank the only bank which people are allowed to use. Control over the money supply is control over base money. Since removing cash would shift base money to the money that is created and stored in private banks, government would have no choice but to assume control, in one form or another, over private banks in order to control the money supply. When banknotes replaced gold as the primary form of money, government monopolized banknotes. If bank credit replaces cash as the primary form of money, government will monopolize the issuance of bank credit. \n\nI present this as if we have a choice, as if I am suggesting that getting rid of cash would be the wrong choice . . . but it seems to me that cash is on its way out regardless of whether anyone likes it or not. People like to argue about stuff like whether bitcoin is more or less convenient than credit cards, or how it improves or does not improve things for the average 1st world consumer, etc. They talk about Bitcoin vs legacy banking like they talk about Apple vs Google. But these issues are really going to be seen to be irrelevant in the long run. Holding onto the legacy system in many ways will require just as many radical changes as anything implied by shifting to a new financial paradigm centered around digital currencies.

We promise. For reals "\n\n\nMr. Franklin sided with the assembly, because in his view the **states right to raise taxes** in order to have a proper, well funded militia ( **essential liberty** ) is more important then allowing some private citizens to refuse to pay taxes and instead to have their own private militia that would be supposedly used to protect the whole state ( **temporary safety** )\n\n\n\nSo yeh, your whole quote is about how important it is for the State to have the right to raise taxes if its needed.\n\n\nAlso I think its bit silly to use (completely butchered) words of a 18th century man to support your 21st century political ideals.': 8, "If you don't get what's meant by the above, an explanation won't help.": -2, 'The Bitcoin tip for 100 bits has been collected by *mughat*.\n\n\n--\n\n[^^what ^^is ^^ChangeTip?](https://www.reddit.com/r/changetip/wiki/tipping-on-reddit)': 0, 'i see this recent "war on cash", especially in the US, as a sign that the Fed (FRB) may try to reverse course on their perma-delayed rate hike from the federal funds rate of 0.25%. a rate hike will likely spur a wave of defaults and drive down real estate prices, potentially creating a collapse.\n\nthe act of effectively banning cash will allow the FRB to do exactly what the ECB is already doing with NIRP - have an effective "tax" on "cash" bank deposits. this allows banks to recapitalize themselves while avoiding a wave of balance-sheet-crushing defaults.\n\nneedless to say, cryptocurrencies throw a rather large monkey wrench in this plan.': 27, 'You may like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUF6klWuB38) trailer ': 4, 'Thanks!': 2, 'Keeping your money is pointless without considering the means of transacting.

To camp oneself as a believer or as explicitly stated by yourself, as a non believer, is slightly irrational. It\'s an innovation, a technological and mental innovation, which solves an ancient problem. That part, I think, is a fact. \n\nOf course bitcoin has problems. The main problem as far as I am concerned is what I call the "hot wallet problem". That is the necessity for, mainly exchanges, to keep bitcoins online, so opening themselves to the best hackers of the world, since they are accessible from any corner of the world, to take their bitcoins. And, eventually, they will, unless some solution is found. Will it be found? Who knows? Will mining centralisation happen? Who knows? Will fees become prohibitive? Who knows.

An innovation that has managed to survive for 6 long years despite facing what has been a barrage of fire. \n\nIt may yet still fail, but it is still far too early to declare bitcoin as something one believes in or does not believe in, as something that will become what its most hardened "believers" envisage or something that will experience a thousand deaths. \n\nFor now, bitcoin is just a technological innovation playing its course, that has potential as well as problems that need to be addressed. \n\nThe rest should be left to the get rich quick crowd. Those with brains, expertise, and means, must instead look at how the world can be improved and whether this egg that we call bitcoin can, through gradual improvements, lead to such a better world.\n\nThe best minds in silicon valley are still looking at how to create yet another picture sharing app. Imagine if their collective mind power was used towards looking at how to create a more efficient way to manage, transfer, spend, save, etc. money. \n\n2008 taught us something.

It so happens that unless they ban computers, companies settled in other jurisdictions will always be able to infiltrate their bans. \n\nI believe you need to study bitcoin a bit deeper and see the many layers of balancing between competing interests as far as the viability of the protocol is concerned.

The dedicated employees would hopefully understand what you were talking about, and if they didn\'t, they\'d at least know to take it to an engineer or someone who does know what it is. But you didn\'t talk to them, you talked to the first-contact person, who is likely part-time and on a short-term contract.

There are a ton of use-cases I can think of, like for example ocean containers are not considered road-worthy past a certain number of miles from a port, so if you are importing merchandise that you intend on storing considerably inland, you need a facility near the port to either transload to a regular trailer for delivery to your location, or perform the sort and seg and PO fulfillment at that third party location. It isn't unheard of for companies to need to send overflow work to other logistics operations than their primary providers due to unexpected delays backing up workload volume out of scope of their primary contracted volume, or rapid ramp-ups to take advantage of new sales opportunities. There are sometimes cases where freight has no place to go, and it's advantageous to contract another warehouse immediately as a one-off, to prevent just keeping freight in a trailer or container and getting raped with charges for not returning the trailer or container, and even that is only possible if you already have a drop arrangement with the drayage carrier and they aren't exclusively operating with live loads. In cases like these it would be amazing to instantly settle for services in cash without the overhead of setting up credit arrangements, for all parties involved.\n\nIn a retail context, the fulfillment speed isn't necessarily where this advantage is felt, because outside of maybe say international situations, a retailer will ship once the credit card goes through anyway. The difference here is shown in the deadweight of fraud/chargebacks, because it's impossible to wait long enough to ship for a credit card to be irreversible.": 5, "* A bitcoin transaction is sent and received as quickly as an email.\n\n    However, transaction is only truly meaningful when it's embedded in a block that is itself embedded in the blockchain. Each new block added to the blockchain buries the previous blocks in the blockchain, confirming that much more the correctness of those blocks' transactions.\n\n    So, if you're selling a coffee for $5, you can probably feel pretty safe trusting just the transaction without waiting for a block to be confirmed.\n\n    However, if you're selling $1000 of gold, then you'll probably want to wait for at least 1 block, and probably 6 blocks, after which it would be nearly impossible to change the transaction history.\n\n    It's a game of probablities; choose your desired risk.\n\n    In any case, waiting for 6 blocks (that is, waiting for approximately 1 hour on average) is *nothing*. Credit Cards and other payment methods can be reversed weeks later.\n\n* Other payment schemes that don't use the blockchain for every transaction are also possible, but it's too early to tell how that might be set up.": 0}, ('Professional Bitcoin Trolls Exist', 25): {'': 1, 'While Ted understands his employer can see the traffic indicating a remote connection when he is connected via a VPN provided by his employer, he believed it to be safe.\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nTed logs into the reddit accounts via a VPN.

Ted surfs to a thread using specific instructions to find it for disruption. From interactions with the dashboard, it becomes evident it is powered by Microsoft .NET and ASP.NET.\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nTed explains that early on, the developers of the Disrupt dashboard realized that using links would leave referral links to the sites they intend to disrupt. While they had the dashboard locked to specific IP addresses, it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t take long for site administrators to understand what was happening. The next iteration contained text with a URL that people such as Ted would copy and paste in to a browser, but the reddit administrators would eventually see direct linking and then voting as a potential means for disruption. In an effort to make sure the traffic and actions seem as organic as possible, each person will move to the particular thread using instructions telling them how to find the same thread that the \xe2\x80\x9cpitcher\xe2\x80\x9d throws at them.\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nTed\xe2\x80\x99s day is simple. He spends approximately eight hours online each day with an hour lunch period. He only uses the dashboard in one window to determine where he will go next and makes efforts to disrupt. Sometimes he is directed to create new posts that will paint bitcoin reddit users in negative ways.\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSometimes, I just have to go and make an anti-female post or something that makes bitcoin users look bad,\xe2\x80\x9d Ted tells us.\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nTed explains that when he first started, he was given plenty of reading material. His first week, he was given limited access to the dashboard that contained a myriad of content that would teach him the basic ropes on how he would be disrupting online conversations or communities. Ted\xe2\x80\x99s assignment was primarily reddit disruption, so he became familiar with the top users in the subreddits he would be tasked with disrupting.\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nLearning about the top posters in the bitcoin subreddit has allowed Ted to understand the viewpoints of the users. As he is engaging them, he is tasked with entering details on the dashboard about those particular users. If he has seen a piece of information in a comment about the geographic location of a particular user for example, he will enter it on the dashboard notes so he or other users can refer to it later.\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nTed is technically an independent contractor who is paid each week. Ted has been working as an independent contractor for this company for approximately a year. When Ted started his new \xe2\x80\x9ccareer path,\xe2\x80\x9d he was making roughly $8 per hour but has since moved up to the $10 an hour level. He understands that eventually he can become a \xe2\x80\x9cpitcher\xe2\x80\x9d or someone who tosses new stories and areas that need disruptions to the \xe2\x80\x9chitters\xe2\x80\x9d such as himself and make approximately $15 an hour.\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nHis weekly checks come from an extensive range of company names. Ted shared several of the canceled checks with the Coin Fire team who then explored the company names and registrations from various states. We found that the companies exist on paper within different states, but that other details, such as addresses, are typically mail drop locations or other postal type boxes.\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nNone of the canceled checks contained names of companies that had any sort of Internet presence so finding out further information outside of what is available in state filings was difficult. The \xe2\x80\x9cleading group\xe2\x80\x9d behind the entire operation likely paying the smaller companies for services is completely hidden.\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nAn ever-changing check signer makes it more difficult for Ted to find new work. While technically a \xe2\x80\x9cconsultant\xe2\x80\x9d on paper and to friends and family, he can\xe2\x80\x99t offer his employer up on a resume or job applications. It appears to potential employers from the outside that Ted has been virtually unemployed for the last year.\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nOver the last several months, Ted has provided check statements, banking statements, messages from various shill accounts on reddit, access to his machine via TeamViewer, and provided names of the ever-changing company he performs work for.\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nWhen we asked Ted who his company represents, he admitted that he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t entirely sure. He speculates it isn\xe2\x80\x99t a government, but rather private companies that are paying the \xe2\x80\x9chome base\xe2\x80\x9d who in turn are paying the team behind the disruption. He has only spoken with a handful of people he works for on brief telephone conversations. He stated he was aware of at least one \xe2\x80\x9cpitcher\xe2\x80\x9d defecting and confessing on reddit one time as his dashboard showed one day the need to disrupt the conversation.\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nWho is behind the trolling and disruption isn\xe2\x80\x99t clear, but whether or not it is having an impact at times has been clear as Ted showed us threads where the entire conversation had been steered another way by his efforts.\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nWe asked Ted if he would continue working and disrupting online conversations. He said that he understands he may get fired if his identity is exposed because of this piece and is ready to accept that outcome, but would make no efforts on his own to quit until he has found another job that can pay his bills.\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nreddit staff did not reply to requests from Coin Fire for comment regarding the information presented.\n\n\n': 6, "Can your release some of the usernames?

Instead of open discussion and debate, it seems that many are only disrupting conversations on the Internet.\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nIt seems that every few months, someone proclaims on reddit that paid internet trolls and shills exist in the bitcoin community.\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nThese claims are usually met with responses from concerned community members, those saying it is garbage, and a series of questions from moderators telling the original poster to prove the claims being made. Many responses from the community insist that the Internet trolls aren\xe2\x80\x99t disrupting anything and that self-policing and moderation will help ensure that trolling doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have an impact.\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nWhile many would like to believe that Internet trolling doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have an impact, the data simply says otherwise. In a study funded by the National Science Foundation titled \xe2\x80\x9cThe \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x98Nasty Effect:\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99 Online Incivility and Risk Perceptions of Emerging Technologies,\xe2\x80\x9d researchers found that Internet trolling does in fact have a negative impact. This study was found that Internet trolling can sow seeds of doubt about the materials being presented.\xc2\xa0 This study offers several insights on how the online environment may shape and polarize perceptions about topics, including new technologies.\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nIn the study, researchers set up a blog and asked participants to read a blog post they had created about a technology called nano silver. The blog post presented points detailing the benefits and potential risks of the technology and with a comments section. Half of the participants saw comments that were trolling and the other half saw a comments section displaying civil discussion taking place.\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nThe comments displayed for both groups were of equal length, contained various perspectives, and both praised the technology and discussed the potential risks. Readers in the study group were asked how they felt about the technology before and after reading the comments.\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nThe participants exposed to the civil discussion reported having the same beliefs about the technology after reading the comments. The participants exposed to the hostile comments reported far more polarized feelings afterwards than they had reported initially. After reading the \xe2\x80\x9ctroll\xe2\x80\x9d comments, the participants reported feeling significantly more negative about the technology and its potential risks than they had previously reported prior to reading the comments.\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nThe findings positively support the theory that Internet trolling can effectively change the perspective of others reading the material presented.\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nAfter the study was published, Popular Science removed comments from articles on the Popular Science website stating,\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nA politically motivated, decades-long war on expertise has eroded the popular consensus on a wide variety of scientifically validated topics.

When I asked him why the message was left in the reddit inbox with nary a response for such a long time, he told me,\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nAt the time, it was just me deciding where to spend resources and time.

The message stated that the person on the other end wanted to make sure we could be trusted to protect his or her identity, and that they would slowly begin passing us the relevant details about the company that employed them and the extent of shilling and trolling on the bitcoin subreddit specifically.\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nOver the next several months, the person on the other end would provide information to our series of highly skeptical questions regarding the operations in which they were involved. We later learned they were part of relatively small team after learning about the job via a friend.\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nWith each set of questions and answers, it seemed that what was being shared with our team was real, but the level of skepticism was still high amongst Coin Fire team members.

The \xe2\x80\x9cDisruptDictator\xe2\x80\x9d system is locked to his specific IP addresses for access and contains several logging systems for his activity inside the dashboard from his employer. His Internet connection was in no way monitored and thus our team had free range to poke around with Ted, but his paranoia was high as he walked our team through several aspects of his daily job all the while requesting we protect his identity and that of the company he contracts for.\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n': 6, 'Do you know who pays the companies?': 0, "Until our source leaves we don't want to reveal the usernames but we did present the full evidence to the staff of reddit including usernames, screenshots, company formation documents, 1099s, access URLs, bank statements, etc and they never replied.\n\nWe've been advised that in situations such as this reddit will typically take the evidence and take appropriate action but won't comment.\n\nIf this is a trolling the person behind it would have spent considerable money to do it.
