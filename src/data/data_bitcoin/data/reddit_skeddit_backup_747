It\'s no secret that many members of the police force will absolutely abuse innocent civilians either physically or not, if they believe they are not being watched and can get away with it. This is what they are PAID to do at this point, essentially. The more arrests they make, the more armored trucks get sent their way.\n\nIt\'s also no secret that plenty of civilians have begun recording police forces anywhere they can. This is one of our constitutional rights. We as civilians need to make it known that we are watching for shenanigans and WILL raise a shit storm if we see shenanigans. Unfortunately this has led to innocent cameramen often becoming a target due to the fact that they hold incriminating evidence on their camera/phone/thingy and some police don\'t like that. What I notice though is that there is a much higher chance of a specific officer being held personally accountable (I\'m big on this) for their actions when there is an independent record of the situation. If this would further be helped by putting cams on the officers themselves, so be it! I see it more as a reaction by them at this point; "Oh you civvies want to record us? We\'ll have our copy too then!" \nReally it\'s only fair. Civilians make a point of saying "I am audio and video recording" and suddenly they have a *small* hand up over the officer. The officer may as well say "me too" and then we are back on even ground, so to speak.\n\nI think this is great, as long as the footage from these officers is actually made public and reviewed fairly in the event of something potentially wrong going down. If a cop shoots some guy and his chest cam shows the guy was doing nothing wrong, that officer should be ENDED. Like DONE. But it\'s great if the video can show that the guy was actually pulling a gun of his own and that the officer acted in self-defense, clearing him of wrongdoing. Every video shot from an officers chest should have his name and badge number permanently displayed in the video, so there is no question of who did what.\n\nThe only thing I wonder about here is... If more police start carrying these cameras and become known for cleaning up their game because they know they are being watched, will that cause the general population to relax? Will people stop recording these situations on their own based on the knowledge that "there is a camera already on that cop"? This could be bad if it ends up that ALL footage is coming from the officer cameras, as once again it opens the door to abuse and a judge saying "the footage was determined to be non-deterministic and it\'s also top-secret hurr hurr". I see it as no different from the cameras on police car dash-boards; they are RARELY used to incriminate an officer, because the footage belongs to, well, the Police.

I'm sick of hearing your bitching. We want accountability for our donations. No transparency, no donations from me.": 4, 'As I have said to Jason privately, I think this post is a great first step towards transparency and their stated goal of becoming a trustless organization. Clearly Sean\'s Outpost has accomplished a great deal, and it is understandable that they prioritized outreach to the homeless over paperwork and accounting.\n\nThat being said, there are a number of issues that I asked Jason to address when he sent me a draft of this post, which still remain. While the financial disclosures released today are detailed and show a desire to be transparent, the lack of supporting documentation still leaves the community in the position of having to trust that the numbers we receive are correct. Specifically:\n\n1. Without providing the bitcoin addresses that received all of the donations, there is no documentation to back up the information about how many BTC Sean\'s Outpost has received. The two public addresses I have managed to find have received a combined total of 556 BTC, which means there is another 387 BTC donated from unknown addresses to unknown addresses. I have asked Jason if there is a reason he cannot share these addresses, and have not received a reply.\n\n2. Without providing any receipts, bills, or statements, there is no documentation to back up the information about how much Sean\'s Outpost has spent in USD. I have asked Jason if there is any disadvantage to posting whatever documentation he used to calculate these expenses, and have not received a reply. [In this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/2mw87l/jason_king_responds_to_seans_outpost_transparency/cm85r7f) I have created a made-up financial statement with every number of Jason\'s inflated by 35%; without any reference to documentation, there is no way for any third party to distinguish between the two sets of numbers.\n\n3. There may be good reasons why Jason is not comfortable making public these two types of documentation. I have urged him, if that is the case, to bring in a pro-bono accountant and a blockchain analysis expert who would, for free, examine the documentation and then publicly attest that donated funds have been used responsibly. I have offered to help with the process of recruiting these people; so far, Jason has not expressed interest in bringing in such third parties.\n\nGoing forward, I also have concerns that the organizational structure Jason describes will not have the intended effect of producing accountability and transparency that is "exponentially better." \n\nAs I see it, a charity can be transparent and accountable to:\n\n1. The blockchain. One dimension of this is to make sure that all transactions are carried out using addresses known to be associated with Sean\'s Outpost, and it sounds like this is the plan going forward. Another dimension is to use multi-signature technology to prevent misuse of funds. I think it is very important to be clear about how the multi-signature approach Jason outlines does and does not accomplish this. Specifically, all three keyholders are personal friends, and two of the three are *both* the main employees at Sean\'s Outpost as well as 2/3 of the board of directors. Multi-sig is just a tool, and it only provides oversight and controls when it puts keys in the hands of people exercising oversight and control. Jason and Mike already run the organization on a day-to-day basis, have control of the finances, and make up a majority of the board. We are still being asked to trust Jason and Mike, and I don\'t see how this particular multi-sig implementation changes that.\n2. The organization\'s board of directors. In the case of Sean\'s Outpost, Jason, Mike, and Jason\'s wife make up the board of directors. For obvious reasons, this does not seem like a good setup to hold Jason and Mike accountable for delivering on the organization\'s goals effectively. I would strongly, strongly encourage Jason to bring outside voices onto the board of directors.\n1. The government. For political reasons, Jason has chosen not to pursue 501c3 status and the disclosure obligations that go with it. He has every right to do so, but it does mean that the need for transparency and accountability shifts to other social mechanisms.\n\n\n3. The public. To repeat myself from above, while the financial disclosures above are a good first step, the public cannot evaluate them effectively while documentation of the revenues and expenses are not made available.\n\n': 26, "> We know how that ended.\n\nActually we don't.  If you look it up online the last thing that happened was SysCoin successfully sued him and he claimed the money wasn't missing at all.  And then absolutely nothing.  What happened?

Hide behind apparently made-up numbers (because difference sources contradict) and you can expect to be called out.\nThere is one thing Jason can do and that is take transparency serious. Else, there is only one thing that donors can do and that is stay away,\nthere are enough scam artists that show off using a small percentage of the donations/investments to make it appear good and legit, but where a (too) large amount disappears in a personal slushfund.\nSince Jason has not given the needed transparency, all we can and should do is exercise caution, warn the unsuspecting and try to find hard evidence. preferably from Jason directly.

The green party has also had a presence there. They've been advocating for UBI since the 90's. The Pirate Party is a young party, we're five years old now and the parliamentary elections next year will be our second chance to get someone in. We almost got a candidate elected the first time with almost non-existing budget and a lot of enthusiasm. We got 0,9% of the votes in Pirkanmaa and Helsinki. 1% in either electoral district would have been enough.\n\nWhat I'm most excited about UBI is that it gives people freedom to act more ethically, because they can't be so easily coerced into \xe2\x80\x93 say \xe2\x80\x93 telemarketing or a job with lousy salary/benefits. It could provide a safety net that only people from privileged families have, even though they might never have to use it.

But you're missing the point about having to provide an equal amount of currency to everyone in the world at the same time. Deflation solves the problem of scarce currency because there is income inequality; some people receive more, other receive less, and that distribution is reformulated through the price system as buying and selling takes place. But with UBI, everyone has to get an equal amount every month. For example, lets start with a supply of 2 million dollars and 1 million people. Every person gets $1, and the other million is allocated based on prices, profit, and loss. But, let's say the population suddenly increases to 4 million. 4 million people are now entitled to $1, but there are only 2 million dollars in existence. Obviously, you have to increase the money supply to continue the UBI guarantee for the expanded population. As for continuously adding decimal places to Bitcoin, that makes the supply unlimited, thus defeating the purpose of Bitcoin. Additionally, what happens when there is a decrease in reproduction or a natural disaster that shrinks the population? Inflation, boom, bust. That cycle will happen because the money left behind won't be distributed evenly, it will be allocated based on inheritance or debt cancellation. Of course, you could use the government to divide that surplus currency evenly throughout the population; this method would still create inflation and business cycles, although perhaps not as severe. Also, such a confiscatory policy would be decidedly anti-libertarian, which is what OP branded the Pirate Party as. So, I think we both agree that you cant have UBI without an unlimited money supply -- because that was my main argument and you basically conceded to that argument by saying we would have to add more decimals to Bitcoin. Where we disagree is on your claim that doing so would not cause inflation; it definitely would because of inevitable population shifts and unequal distributions of surplus currency/an absence of a uniform spending to saving ratio of an equally distributed currency surplus. So again, if you're trying to guarantee UBI with an unlimited money supply, there's going to be inflation; if you're trying to guarantee UBI with a limited money supply, you're going to run out of money and will be forced to discontinue the program. UBI and Bitcoin are simply incompatible on an economic level.  ": 1, '>What do you think would fail in a world with Bitcoin and UBI and why would it fail?\n\nSupply and demand. Bitcoin supply is fixed, the population is continuously growing. Since every person would be entitled to a certain amount of money every month, a growing population would constantly increase the demand for money. At some point, the number of people on earth will surpass the number of available satoshis. Once that happens, once supply surpasses demand, it would be impossible to provide everyone with a fixed amount of Bitcoin per month. A fixed money supply with no UBI can work with a growing population because the purchasing power of each unit of BTC will rise, and everyone will have varying levels of income. But, if we are going to give everyone a base amount of income each month, then there has to be a large enough supply for everyone to have an equal amount. Thus, a UBI requires an elastic money supply, thereby making Bitcoin and UBI incompatible *economically,* not politically or morally.': 1, 'I say lets re-brand the libertarian party as the pirate party.\n\nIf nothing else we could get cool hats.

We can always add more decimals to the currency making it infinitely divisible. In a sense the supply is unlimited, but without the need for inflation.

I attended talks about it by its inventors, I used it, I know why it\'s supposed to be better and how it works.\n\nThe theory would be true if all voters cared. Unfortunately, they don\'t. The system strongly favors delegated over direct votes. Direct votes require a lot of effort and time, while delegation is a one-off, fire-and-forget thing. Delegates cast hundreds (on in a parliament-replacement scenario, hundreds of thousands) votes at once, and they tend to always participate (because a. their vote actually matters, b. they know how to use the system, so they set up ring delegations among friends). The individual voters correcting them are impacted by participation ("turnout"), which is very hard to get high enough even in one-man-one-vote systems. Because Liquid gives participants the (not too inaccurate) impression that their individual vote does not have much say, participation drops further. Sure a small part of the voters who disagree with their delegate\'s vote will correct it (directly or by changing their delegate), but not enough of them.\n\nEven if the turnout is high, unless it is as high as delegated voting turnout, it effectively places direct votes at a strong disadvantage.\n\nAs I said - I saw the effects in practice, and I would oppose any attempt to introduce this anywhere as vigorously as I initially supported this.\n\nThe current state of the German Pirate Party (best explained with [this symbolic picture](http://imgur.com/6CK7Dy2)) can, IMHO, be attributed to a great part to not having a usable direct-democratic tool due to the failed LQFB experiment.\n': 1, 'I disagree with you.

This (overwrite your delegate\'s vote) must be an easy possibility, obviously. And eventually a percentage of these people would change their delegate too, if they were that unsatisfied. You should be able to change your delegate at any moment.\n\nAnother important point for liquid democracy to be effective is not to have a Parliament at all. Anybody who wanted to be a delegate should be able to, this should not be a full time job payed by taxvictims. So, basically, if you don\'t want to get involved in politics, but you trust your "smart cousin" enough to vote for you, delegate to him. As Mike describe on his paper, delegation could also be based on themes. For example, everything concerning education you delegate to the principal of your children\'s school, everything concerning technology you delegate to your geek brother and so on. The ideal is that the average delegate only represent a few dozens of people, not more. This could dramatically reduce delegate\'s power. Plus, people would probably eventually realize that they are insignificant on larger votes of millions of people, but their voice is better heard on small votes of a few thousands: that would push to actual decentralization of power, more things being decided on the local level instead of federal/national level.

But the truth is that the greatest progress in the US has come from propositions, not from elected representatives.': 2, 'I\'ve seen liquid democracy in practice. It does not work and kills direct-democratic participation, because individuals with one vote each now compete with politicians with a mass of delegated votes. "Voter turnout" is what causes the problem - a lot of people delegate and stop caring.\n\nThe opinion favored by politicians is only affected by delegation turnout, i.e. the number of people who took the one-time effort of delegating to a person/group they like. The other opinion is affected by turnout for direct votes, which is much lower and puts it at a massive disadvantage.\n\n\nLet\'s assume you have a scenario where:\n - 70% of the people want A\n - 90% have made a delegation\n - politicians representing 80% of the delegated votes vote for B\n - the 70% wanting A consist of 9% (of the total) who delegated to A-voting politicians, 54% who delegated to B-voting politicians, and 7% without delegations. Thus, 61% who are unhappy with how their vote gets used.\n\nNow you have 72% of all possible votes voting for B, i. e. 22% of all voters have to change their vote. Thus, more than 1/3rd of the voters who are unhappy need to manually go and vote themselves. That might seem reasonable when compared with regular turnouts, but it isn\'t. (It also grows if the people who want B but delegated to A-voters go vote).\n\nIn less clear cases, individual votes don\'t matter, and this discourages participation. If you see 100 people voting X, and 1 person with 120 stale delegations voting Y, 50 times in a row, you stop participating. Add to this that there is no single rally point, no "everybody get out to vote today", and a 33% voter turnout is nearly impossible. Even close call votes in Switzerland, which don\'t suffer of any of these issues, rarely have more than 50% turnout.\n\nLiquid democracy looks nice on paper, but fails horribly in reality.': 2, "I guess that's why they didn't get women's suffrage until 1971.
