But public perception and the media soul or take decades to develop sycophant for the facts and bitcoin the currency would remain niche. Litecoin and other cryptocurrency might do well as hodlers RTT to hedge, but would bitcoin be dead?\n\nThat's the absolute worst case scenario and it assumes malicious intent when what is more likely is that we'd have a new big hodler, even if it was a government. What government is going to throw away billions worth of value to to kill bitcoin? They'd stock it right in their central bank reserves and everyone knows it, even the people who hate bitcoin know that is what they would do. They might sell it slowly, but they wouldn't kill it.\n\nHow close are we to quantum hacking? 10 years? By that time bitcoin will be so embedded in our financial and legal infrastructure that the number of possible malicious actors simply witless down to near zero.\n\nMore than likely even if these coins are hacked, we won't know if it's Satoshi himself finally moving his coins around or a hacker.": 1, 'Actually all this talk about a quantum hack of satoshi\'s stash is basically pointless.

If you look at the current d-wave quantum annealer, that is not likely.\n\nAlso, we got lucky that ASIC makers sold the chips instead of using them themselves, and that ASICs are cheap enough to develop that multiple companies did it in parallel. We may not get that lucky with quantum computers - since they're also useful for other stuff, a quantum computer owner also does not have to worry about the long-term effects as much as ASIC owners (because their ASICs would be useless if Bitcoin failed).": 1, "It is every individual's right to decide whether or not to accept one thing in exchange for another.  Collectively, it is the network's choice whether or not to accept certain coins, or to choose to value them at all. By the 'network' I am referring to the emergent choice of many individuals.  Keeping this context in mind, it must be understood that one possible, probable outcome is that the Bitcoin community decides to refuse to accept coins who's ownership is no longer certain due to compromise of the underlying crypto, on account of quantum advances or otherwise.\n\ntl;dr:  If quantum computers render Satoshi's coins up for grabs, the community could blacklist them.": 1, 'Depends of the size of the quantum computer. But the first ones will give us warning time.': 3, 'Of course independence is key! But we must be realistic that this is a tug-of-war between reality and idealism. Where, as time goes by, the ideas sculpt reality and reality grounds the ideas. As much as one is to hope that miners would be consistent in the face of such a crisis, it can\'t be taken for granted. \n\nAlso, when you say "download and install new version", what you are talking about is a hard fork. I truly hope that our governance model gets to a point where we can launch hardforks at our whims but it certainly isn\'t the case now. \n\nWe can have lead developers (Gavin, van der Laan and Theymos? I think are the ones that have keys to do this) send a network  emergency alert to get everyone to update core... True... But what if the attacker suddenly puts his miners back online from new IPs. And then turns them off again. And on once more? Are we really gonna have people launch hard forks multiple times over the course of days? \n\nIt seems to me that our best bet is to let the network grow so large that even the US could mobilize enough resources to deprecate it. This would imply that the ideas have won by remolding our world  for the better.

I see two reasons why people here defend Ross: they either think he is being persecuted solely for using bitcoin (not true), or they think his persecution is causing investments in bitcoin to lose value (definitely not true).
