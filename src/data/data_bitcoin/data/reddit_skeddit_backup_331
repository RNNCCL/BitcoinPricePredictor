This is because you have to use the analogy of bitcoin being nuggets of gold.\n\n\nI.e. imagine you are buying something that is say 6grams of gold but you have only 3 nuggets each weighing 7grams, 4grams and 3 grams respectively...  Now imagine your 7 gram and 4 gram nuggets were being tracked.\n\nYou have two solutions, one is to melt the 7 grams down to create 1 nugget of 6 grams and another 1 gram nugget... Now you can hand over the 6 gram nugget as payment.  In this scenario it's clear to see the 7 gram nugget can be safely tracked to the new recipient and your change.\n\n\nHowever if you were to melt your 4 and 3 gram nuggets down to create a 6 and 1 gram to pay it gets trickier since only the 4gram nugget is of interest.  Both the 6 and 1 gram nuggets now have a 'taint analysis' of 4/(4-3)=57%.  I.e. the tracked coins are no longer pure but been mixed with legitimate untracked coins so which one do you follow?\n\nCarry on this process and you can see there is no such thing as a tainted bitcoin since each transaction creates new nuggets that are even more diluted until the idea of a tainted coin makes no sense.\nWhat you can do is work backwards... if you're an exchange for instance you can see if some nuggets have historically been created from tracked coins over a certain taint threshold.  If this is the case, the person depositing the coins probably didn't do it but they can tell you where they got the coins from.  Again that next person may also not be the person of interest but they might be able to say where the transaction was from and so on...\n\nThis is incredibly hard investigative work so blanket surveillance is difficult/unlikely the traditional banking system where every non cash transaction can be analysed.  What it means in practice is if a transaction happened that was worth investigative resources at some point in the future someone determined enough with the right warrants can probably find out who made it but generally it's not possible to censor transactions as it just takes one person anywhere in the network to accept a payment that dilutes any taint analysis/blacklist.\n\n\n\n": 2}, ('When you go to the pub, order a pint to pay with bitcoin and your battery runs out', 0): {'Definitely going to carry one when spending with bitcoin :-) ': 1, "> Iphones don't last the whole day on average use...\n\nYet that's not what you're experiencing.

For the benefit of everyone, but mostly their members.', 0): {"I didn't say it had no positive effect on identifying centralization, on the contrary. It has a positive effect of identifying unintentional or benign centralization. It has no positive effect against an intentional, malicious actor.\n\nBut even if you convinced all pools to stop labeling their blocks via the coinbase, someone would figure it out and label them. The result would be an even less accurate picture, since not all blocks would necessarily be identified properly. You can't stop random people from analyzing the data and producing their results, however inaccurate that may be. So instead of fighting an unwinnable battle, it's better to provide those people with as much accurate data as possible so they can provide more accurate results.\n\nAs far as miners making more profit if the network grows, within the context of the block size debate, I disagree. I think it's disadvantageous for the miners (and likely where a lot of the erroneous negative sentiment comes from) - increasing the block size eliminates the pressure to pay fees to mine a transaction. If there is always enough room in a block for all transactions, then why pay fees? They will all fit in a block. Conversely, if there is limited space in each block, the incentive to pay higher fees to get in the next block increases... larger blocks are definitely very bad for mining and may likely lead to the death of bitcoin mining as we know it, but certainly not for any of the silly reasons people have put forth so far. \n\nIn the larger context, though, Bitcoin needs larger block sizes to accommodate more transactions within a reasonable amount of time. There is a sweet spot on size vs # of transactions per second. I'm not sure what that sweet spot is (which is why I don't jump into the debate), but that is, ultimately, the first, last and only reasonable argument for block size changes. Any other argument for or against it is superfluous and tangential to the survival of the network.\n\nWithout mining, the network doesn't exist. Without larger blocks, the network will not grow beyond a certain point. If you disregard either factor, the network will die; it's just a matter of when.\n": 1, "So we agree that there is no protection/benefit from identifying blocks if you assume the attacker is malicious.\n\nI have seen only 3 justifications for the 'small blockist' position . First is - miners are not validating because it 'takes too long', which is countered by the fact that they lose money in the event of building on an invalid block and the incentive structure will soon oust this kind of behaviour, the system working as designed. Second is 'number of nodes is rapidly in decline' which is countered by the evidence that in fact we are stable at around 6k for 18+ months and there is ample nodes for SPV wallets and propogating txs to miners works perfectly efficiently with this number of nodes. Third and most often is that larger blocks will further 'centralise mining' to which I reply, that's unmeasurable in reality and as a retort I am pointed to blockchain.info/pools and the like. The lay person with little understanding of these things would likely agree that it appears we are in danger of being subverted by collaborating Chinese miners.\n\nIn a world of identified blocks an opportunistic attacker can see they are approaching an opportunity and can take steps to hide their approaching opportunity from the community by diverting some hash power until they are ready to launch their attack. In a world of unidentified blocks they can never be sure they are approaching the threshold or simply having a run of good luck. No?\n\nWhat benefits are their to identifying the authors of blocks in reality?  I think it's clear their is a detriment.\n\nEdit- BTW thanks for you time, I appreciate the discussion.": 1, "Interesting.. Thanks, I thought miners could mine in a way that ensures no one could identify their blocks with a little care, are you sure this is not possible and someone else would identify them??\n\nAnd I hadn't considered it before but I suppose you may well be correct that until the harmful effects of limiting block size are clearly filtering through to price, miners might be foolish enough to believe it's in their interest to aim to boost fees over enhancing price through network growth.\n\nOn reflection I guess you must be right, attributing this many small blockists to entrenched interests in the incumbent financial system is probably giving them to much credit and there's nowhere else they could be coming from except the mining community.\n\n I can't see any benefit in the ability to identify benign centralisation though.": 1, "If you are pool mining and you are not the pool operator, you can't do a 51% attack. \n\nFor that matter, if you are pool mining, you aren't really mining. The pool is. You are just providing computing resources for the pool. \n\nIf a certain pool is creating a disproportionate number of blocks, you can be sure the network is becoming decentralized. Identifying blocks helps identify that. \n\nIf you are trying to clandestinely mine a majority of the blocks, you will be doing it solo and can create as many bitcoind instances as you want... But then a large amount of unknown blocks will show up and people will know something is up.\n\nIdentifying blocks from known sources  only helps with identifying network (or potential network) centralization, it does not hinder it.": 3, 'I\'m not sure really where to start in a response to you, so I\'m going to back up a bit just to be sure the fundamentals are covered, because I think there may be a misunderstanding at a basic level.\n\nA 51% attack is a theoretical threshold where an hypothetical attacker can arbitrarily dictate to the network what blocks are valid and what are not. In the real world, you would need much more than 51% of the network to perform any sort of useful attack in a reasonable time frame, mostly due to the vagueries of luck and probability. To perform what most people think of as a true 51% attack, you\'d need about 80% of the hashing power on the network to guarantee building the longest chain most of the time.  Could it be done with 51%? Sure, absolutely, but it would take a very long time to make your hashing power felt across the network and by that time, the network would likely have responded by blocking out at least a portion of your hashing power.\n\nThat said, lets say you either are able to acquire 80% of the hashing power on the network or we just take the hypothetical attack at 51% as reality. Now what?\n\nFirst, lets assume a world where no blocks are identified and we have no idea who\'s creating blocks:\n\nAn anonymous attacker has no need to hide their hashing power. They mine wherever they want... either on a pool or solo mine until they are ready to pounce. That day comes and they attack the network. Since no one could identify blocks, no one had any idea the attack was coming and everyone is scrambling to fix the problem.\n\nNow, lets assume a world were blocks are identified as best as possible, like we have now:\n\nAn anonymous attacker spreads their hashing power out over a number of pools (this would be kind of silly, but hey, why not!) to hide their capabilities until the day comes to attack the network. That day arrives and they switch to their own block generating methods (bitcoind, etc...). Since the hashing power was spread throughout all the pools, no one had any idea the attack was coming and everyone is scrambling to fix the problem.\n\nSame result. It makes no difference if the blocks are identified if you assume a malicious, intentional attacker. \n\nHowever, if blocks are identified, we can divert hashing power away from unintentional attacker or opportunistic ones (opportunistic malicious pool operators, such as we saw with CEX.IO et al). \n\nYour last statement is puzzling - Who is using identified block statistics as "evidence" to support keeping blocks small? That is not a valid argument and I haven\'t seen any credible arguments use this as a reason to keep the block sizes small. There is no reason NOT to identify blocks from a technical standpoint (from a security/anonymization/freedom standpoint, you could make some arguments, certainly). Identifying block sources does nothing detrimental to the security of the network against a 51% attack. If you buy into the argument that it\'s an illusion, so what? You\'re still no better off if you don\'t identify it.\n\nNow, all that being said, I did realize that through your arguments, a malicious attacker could superficially make it look like a pool had MORE than it\'s actual hashrate by generating blocks with it\'s signature. If no one verified that (which is unlikely), you could potentially drive people away from the pool by making it look like it had 51% of the network. Though this is unlikely and easily verified, and somewhat pointless.\n\n': 1, 'While it\'s technically possible to obfuscate the origin of blocks, the LOE required and the vigilance that would need to be maintained would be more than most people want to put forth. To truly anonymize block origins over the long term would require significant effort currently. You could do it for a small number of blocks, but over time a pattern would emerge with a particular miner. \n\nI would wager the majority of the dissent comes from the mining community in one way or another, at least that\'s always been my belief, since larger blocks completely destroyed the whole mining paradigm as it currently sits. The mining community has never been one to act rationally or with any foresight and it\'s always someone elses fault when things go a different way than the miner is expecting. This is just another example of that. Mining has typically been about the short term, anything more than 2 or 3 months down the road is irrelevant to the vast majority of miners, so you won\'t find any rational miners advocating for something that would benefit them three years down the road.\n\nAs far as the benefit to identify blocks vis-a-vis benign centralization, it doesn\'t really matter if there is a benefit. It\'s "interesting" and someone is going to do it "just because." \n': 1, "If you are intentionally working towards a 51% attack you want your hardware earning up until is time to launch the attack, you mine in various pools to hide your power until you are ready to leave the pool and launch your attack.\n\nIf a certain pool is creating a disproportionate number of blocks they are advertising to the world their hash power and that's a foolish unlikely way for an intentional 51% attacker to behave so it's not a cause for concern.\n\nIdentifying blocks achieves nothing except create the illusion that you have some idea how hashpower is divided. Reality is you have no idea and you have to simply trust that >50% is honest.\n\nHowever it has a detrimental effect as we see now in that people can erroneously cry 'centralisation' and use worthless identified block statistics as 'evidence' to support the cause of keeping blocks small and limiting bitcoins potential.": 1, "Agreed, my reasoning for suggestion we stop identifying blocks was because it has no positive effect on anything in terms of identifying centralisation or the possibility of a mining majority attack and like you say, does bolster people who would use flawed statistics to bolster a failed argument.\n \nIf you also agree that miners will make more profits if the network grows it usefulness which can only happen with larger block sizes then, can you see your way to agreeing that it would be in the miners best interest to stop publishing their authorship of blocks? Since this will result in less detracters to larger blocks and therefore eventually more value in bitcoin and by extension more value in the block rewards. It's a small thing but your average potential big player could easily be put off by looking at blockchain.info/pools and reading the doom sayers posts about 'centralisation of mining' and decide that bitcoin is too immature. If we convince miners to convince pools to stop publishing their authorship, we take away a tool from the dissenters with no discernible loss to those who would see the network prosper with large blocks.\n\nSatoshi didn't foresee mining pools as far as I can tell, his original belief was that all mining would be anonymous and there would be nothing other than the trust in the protocol rules and significant likelihood that >50% of miners would be self serving to convince the user base of the decentralised nature of it. Blockchain.info/pools helps no one except propagandists.": 1, "That just makes it easier to fake mining into a scam when the users can't verify what they are actually doing. \n": 1, "Just for the record, I think all of the arguments against larger blocks are complete bollocks. I have no idea why people are so resistant to it and any argument I've seen so far is ridiculous at best.\n\nIdentifying blocks or leaving them anonymous means absolutely nothing in terms of diving how much hashing power you have vs the network or to determining the speed of the network. One only has to look at network difficulty to determine what the average network hashrate is over the past two weeks. Presumably this hypothetical attacker will know how much hashing power they control, so the attacker will know how much they have vs the network at any given time.\n\nSo while the majority of your argument is valid from the standpoint of people using flawed statistics to bolster a failed argument (larger block sizes are bad being a failed argument) as being bad, identifying blocks doesn't really have any negative effect on anything, except people using flawed data to make arguments. A better crusade would be to get people to stop using fuzzy, imprecise statistics to make arguments against a valid, quantifiable improvement to the network. \n\nThat would, however, require people to be logical and rational. That is a fools errand if I ever heard of one. :)\n": 1}, ("I'm lost in the blocksize limit debate", 120): {'> Increasing the block size will increase the bandwidth and storage requirements, making it impractical to run full-nodes\n\nThis is the only legitimate argument for small blocks. All others hinge on this being true.\n\nThe small blockers think that a recent decrease in full nodes is attributed to the increase in transaction volume. Thus, if we increase the block size limit and allow more transaction volume, the full node count will decrease and we will have a centralization effect.\n\nThey say that you can not run a full node on a typical home broadband connection even today, as it hogs too much bandwidth. However, I am not convinced. I just ordered a raspberry pi 2 and a 64GB SD card for about $70, and I plan on putting that to the test soon. If it hogs up my bandwidth connection too much with the default settings, I am confident that by using the maxconnections setting like a bandwidth limiter I can find a comfortable balance while still contributing to the health of the bitcoin network.': 8, 'at the risk of betraying my allegiance (I tried to objectively state the sides), simply "yes". \n\nWhen I first heard of Bitcoin, I ran a full node because I had to.  That was the only option. Same for everyone else. Now there are more efficient ways of handling Bitcoin, such as electrum, etc. So it\'s not necessary to run a full node simply to receive and spend bitcoins.\n\nIt\'s great that a node will run on something as underpowered as a Pi, it really is. But I think that node operators who want to help Bitcoin should do so by providing ample hardware, storage and bandwidth, not by holding the rest of the network back by demanding that whatever arbitrarily constrained hardware or setup they have should be able to be a member. Not accusing you, and a Pi\'s ARM Seems plenty fast enough. But there are people trying to run nodes  and services over capped 4G cellular connections, for example. \n\nBut yeah, I think the node drop is simply because the Core wallet is no longer the only wallet. Other clients exist that provide better features, a side effect of that being that they don\'t run as full nodes anymore. Increasing storage requirements may push a few more people to pull the plug, but really, if they\'re pulling the plug because their hatd drive is filling up because people are actually transacting, can the even be viewed as supporting the network at all?

One of the founding principles of bitcoin is that it eliminates third party trust.  But a user can only enjoy this trustlessness if they are able to check every transaction in the blockchain.

The computer science says it\'s an O(n^2) problem (everyone needs to download and validate everyone elses transactions to maintain trustlessness).

New validators starting from scratch can get up to speed fully pretty soon, rather than sync for weeks or months.\n\n3) There's no huge advantage big miners (xx% hashrate) have over small miners (0.x% hashrate), or well-resourced miners (very well connected, low latencies, high throughputs) have over poorly-resourced miners (China-type connections, huge latency, low throughput). Which could otherwise skew incentives. (arguably not a problem at all)\n\n----\n\n> Even with the 1MB limit, anyone can still flood the network with transactions which saturate the mempools for hours. Why does increasing the limit make this worse?\n\nThe size of the mempool isn't really relevant for these spam attacks, just temporarily at best. The size of the UTXO set and the validation time is. The UTXO set grows after such spam transactions are actually being mined by miners rather than discarded after lingering in the mempool. They are forever part of bitcoin's history and thus need to be kept in the UTXO set, and validated by everyone, today and in the future. If that transaction is spam, then that's not great.\n\nIncreasing the limit causes this potential problem to grow. No limit causes the problem to potentially grow unbounded.\n\nThat said. I believe validators (nodes) can permit themselves to be agnostic over what they are validating; whether it's spam or legitimate transacting. It's a miners' jobs to filter what does and does not go in the blockchain. Validators should only care about whether or not they can handle the strain. So from the validators' perspective, the limit can go up by quite a bit; most decent nodes are running idle.

Nobody knows what that threshold is, but in general core-devs are being conservative while Mike and Gavin dont care about centralisation.

If 90 % of users want to increase the cap from 21 million to 42 million, then we should go ahead and make that change.\n\nOne of the main reasons that the bitcoin system is so beautiful in its design, is that the incentives that are built-in into the system makes such an opinion vanishingly unlikely to ever reach anywhere near a majority. \n\nUnderstanding these incentives is what makes it possible to trust that the 21 million cap is extremely likely to remain forever. Ensuring such a cap has historically before bitcoin was invented, never been possible because the incentives to "keep printing money" have always been overwhelmingly positive. \n\nThat\'s because the "printing of money" has always been a centralized process controlled by the few to the detriment of the many, whereas in the bitcoin system this process and control is decentralized and controlled by the many. That fundamentally changes the incentives to want to keep the cap at 21 million. \n\nSo, who should do the voting? Practically speaking the only ones who can vote in a way that is not sensitive to "sybil attacks" are the miners due to "proof of work" making sybil attacks not possible. So while it seems unfair that exchanges, node operators, merchants and ordinary users are not allowed to vote, the miners can\'t actually ignore those people. They have to carefully consider the desires of every other type of network participant, because if everyone but the miners disagree with the miners, then a hard fork will happen and the miners will soon find that they are mining blocks that no significant amount of actual people are using. \n\nSo, the miners are incentivized to vote with the whole system in mind. It\'s difficult to replace the miners, but they\'re not irreplaceable, and they and the other types of network participants all know that. In a way, the miners are just glorified number crunchers. At the same time, the bitcoin system cannot function without such number crunchers. \n\nSo the system should be stable. I\'m writing "should" because I constantly surprise myself by being wrong about things, so copy my reasoning at your own risk. In fact, I\'m often finding myself in the kitchen not remembering why I went there. So it\'s important that you think through the system yourself before you choose to trust it.

Well, because there was a time before the 1 MB limit was implemented (coincidentally through a hard fork).

That moment in time is when the bitcoin project attracted its first significant number of users, advocates and investors. \n\nAfter that, Satoshi implemented a 1 MB limit for the purpose of prohibiting spam attacks. The intention (and reason for making the implementation) was never to ensure a large decentralization of nodes. Satoshi didn\'t think so, and no one else at that time thought so. Therefore no one protested the, in effect, core consensus rule change. It was implied that the limit was only there to prevent potential blocksize bloat spam attacks.\n\nSo, when suddenly a few people started proclaiming that the purpose of the 1 MB limit was to stimulate an increase in the number of nodes and therefore node decentralization, most old and current users said "Hold on a minute, this is not the original purpose of the limit, and also not the reason I got interested in bitcoin. This is not the consensus. This is actually a change to the consensus we\'ve had so far.".\n\nSo keeping the max blocksize at a size that defends against blocksize bloat spam attacks is keeping consensus. Changing the purpose of the limit is changing the consensus. If we keep the consensus, we must also keep increasing the limit so that it only has the originally agreed upon purpose which is to defend against spam. Stimulating node decentralization is another kind of blocksize limit and is a separate issue and must be regarded as such, or else we are making consensus-breaking changes.': 5, 'I\'m a "large-block supporter" and agree that we should not censor XT client posts.

Another group of devs, the more well-known among them being /u/nullc, /u/luke-jr and /u/pwuille (he proposed a very, very conservative alternative) are against such a change, stating that it will result in high bandwidth use and loss of decentralization. Lots of discussion were had about how bad/not-so-bad the impact actually was, and how to weigh it against the danger of stunting growth and/or centralizing somewhere else, but no agreement was reached.\nMany actors in the space (exchanges, payment processors, big pool operators) have stated, in a scattershot way over time, that they support some form of maxblocksize increase; however, due to opposition from the latter group, no such increase has been merged into the Core code, for a long time.\nIn his frustration, Mike Hearn proposed (and later did) to include code for lifting the blocksize in his alternative client based on Core, Bitcoin-XT. It is still being tested, and is supposed to only go into effect if a supermajority of miner adopts it. \n\nIF YOU WANT BITCOIN ON THE MOON - SUPPORT BIGGER BLOCKS.': 5, "Well, it is everyone's choice to go XT or not.": 3, '> IF YOU WANT BITCOIN ON THE MOON - SUPPORT BIGGER BLOCKS.\n\nActually..\n\nMuch of the value of a currency comes from its network effect. The value of a network goes as the square of the number of users. Meaning if with a hardfork you split the bitcoin network exactly in half, the value would go down by a factor of **four**.\n\nThis is why many of us are warning a controversial hard fork is dangerous.': 1, "If there's any chance that there is a fair amount of mining that continues mining on the original chain for days and days after the hardfork occurs (maybe even just 15% or 25% of the level that was mining pre-fork) , then you're gonna have a bad time.\n\nWhat happens if that bifurcation is the result is that we now have two coins -- bitcoins (BTCs) mined on the original chain (where the 1MB limit is still enforced) and coins on a new chain (BTXs) mined on the big blocks / Bitcoin-XT chain.\n\nThese two different coins trade for different values -- maybe BTCs trade for $100 and BTXs trade for $120.     So you want to spend some pre-fork coins that you had in your wallet and using Bitcoin-XT you transact -- 1.0 BTX for about $120 worth of value.   Congratulations, you just also sent the BTC worth $100 along as well.  This is because no clients are fork-aware and support spending on both chains.     There is a step you can do yourself so that you get the 1.0 BTC (worth $100) plus the 1.0 BTX (worth $120) for spending, but it isn't anything automatic.\n\nSo it's a bad idea to proceed with something that has a good likelihood of harming users like that.   The only reason to proceed is that nearly everyone is onboard and that there is little doubt that mining on the original chain will end.

A cartel of miners with 51% of the total mining capacity has the ability to censor transactions at will.  A cartel that is has the ability to exceed 100% of the existing mining capacity is able to mine a private fork for the purpose of double spending their own transactions -- which is (data) corruption of the blockchain.\n\nWIth Bitcoin, this attack for the purpose of double spending would require about $200M USD worth of specialized mining hardware.   There\'s almost no scenarios where such an attack would be able to be carried out either profitably or without being identifiable.\n\nThis attack is possible because Bitcoin uses a "proof-of-work" approach to mining.   Nobody knows the minimum amount of "work" that would be needed to be performed to protect Bitcoin today so comparing the security of Bitcoin versus some other coin can\'t be done simply by comparing hashrates.   For example, a six-foot thick steel wall of a bank vault might provide no more protection than does a six-inch thick steel wall.      But without a six-inch thick wall -- the vault might be considered vulnerable to an attack.     Likely Bitcoin\'s mining network currently has many times more protection from its mining network than is really needed.  Whether or not the next closest proof-of-work based coin has sufficient protection is unknown.  Certainly, some of the proof-of-work coins more minor than Litecoin are definitely vulnerable to a 51% attack and such attacks against them are not rare.\n\nSo, if you were given the choice of putting your valuables in one bank vault that might not have thick enough steel walls, but your other option is putting them in a vault for the bank next door which has walls more than thick enough steel walls, which would you choose.\n\nWe just haven\'t seen (yet) any attacks against proof-of-work blockchains where double spending by the attacker succeeded in yanking significant amounts of value.
