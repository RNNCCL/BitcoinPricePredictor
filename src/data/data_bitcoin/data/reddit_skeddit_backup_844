Can't wait!": 2, "One of the concepts that comes up often in discussions of P2P organization is the idea of automated contract generation, where network software platforms with architectures similar to Bitcoin's can be used to synthesize formal contracts at the same time they're mediating communication and exchange. This is particularly relevant where one is orchestrating the on-demand production of things across a diverse network of suppliers and fabricators and where a contract becomes attached to a set of digital plans or 'recipes' for production that may be produced by interactive design tools. (configurators, as they are sometimes called) \n\nSo imagine the near future where on-demand production consists of an open value network cloud of individual producers all plugged-into an automated materials transport and logistics system--automated packet transit backed up by various automated materials handling centers working as a public storage utility in the manner of a cloud data service. An Internet of Stuff. (what Amazon is ultimately destined to evolve into even if Jeff Bezos doesn't realize it yet...)  \n\nIn this network there are no 'manufacturers'. It's just various multi-purpose production nodes in various geographical locations. So 'products' are initiated chiefly by their designers who market their designs to consumers who initiate on-demand production of the product when they buy it. \n\nSo a consumer is shopping on-line in a catalog that is really just a showcase of designs, some of which may have configurators with them to allow for various kinds of customization/personalization. The catalog has an 'awareness' of the production network behind it. It does what you might call anticipatory or theoretical product orders so it can display things to the user like a price-over-options list or a price-over-ETA list that relates to the variable cost of production based on options or the amount of time you're willing to wait to have the product delivered. \n\nWhen the customer clicks the 'buy' button it generates a 'spime' for the product. This is a package of digital data that has a recipe for production, a history for the product, and a distributed contract for production that begins with the designer of the product and then spreads out into the network as the system seeks the best cost-over-time-efficient set of bidders for all the materials and steps of production needed for the product. When an optimal contract is modeled and confirmed--all digitally--the machines start going and the production of the product fans-in across the network toward the customer's delivery point and the return value--let's say Bitcoin--flows out across the same network. One can imagine many models of production and service where systems like this might apply.\n\nThis is one of many possible applications of a social-semantic web platform currently in development called Netention. \n\nhttp://p2pfoundation.net/Netention\n\nYou don't hear much about Semantic Web or Semantic Desktop applications outside of the P2P community because, frankly, most people in IT don't actually understand what it is. But in simple terms its a way to build-into the web's architecture a means for masses of information to auto-associate with each other in various useful ways. Netention is basically intended as a semantic social network platform that semi-anonymously builds life-profiles of users, quantifies their routine needs and life-goals, so that mutually supportive social connections can be identified and mediated among them. Think Facebook with a 'pronoia' imperative. A secret digital conspiracy that's out to help you and everyone else. And part of this is to facilitate value networks and exchange contracts integrated with whatever production, service, and communication networks might develop for them. \n\nI suggest that such technology will come to evolve into what I like to called a Digital Tao; a global social-semantic web integrated into a global production web and a global environmental monitoring web that democratically embodies the objectives of the whole society balanced against the tailored needs of the individual and the sustainability demands of the environment and eliminates currencies altogether by digitally trading in pure demand and social credit. You could say it's sort of like Jacque Fresco's Cybernation but based on a more contemporary notion of computing than Fresco's '60s era centralized model of large scale computing.

It's sort of like trying to re-invent economics with a Linux development model. \n\nOther concepts along this line include Open Value Networks as explored by companies such as Sensorica and various other Social Entrepreneurial ventures. (note that the terms 'value network' as been mis-appropriated recently by some corporate consulting businesses) Open Value Networks are intended to create infrastructures for development and production of real stuff through an opt-in manner of participation. Imagine if instead of applying for a 'job' in a company that produces things--going through all those weird classist corporate rituals--you simply opted-into--of your own volition--a network that produces stuff and then flows profit share back to you in direct proportion to the practical value of your contribution. \n\nhttp://valuenetwork.referata.com/wiki/Main_Page\n\nSo when you hear people talk about how Bitcoin has the potential to change the world, well, that's exactly what it was intended for. It's really intended to be culturally and socially disruptive, propagating similar digitally assisted models/structures of organization. And the ultimate goal? Post-scarcity.

Bitcoin, for example, is build under the philosophy that power over a currency should be at root separated from possession of the currency itself. This allows it to become a universal currency, a global currency, one that isn\'t pegged to some underlying system of value like a national economy or the value of a company where the power or ownership of that system is represented through ownership of the currency. It is by separating power from money that Bitcoin attains this quality of "free-floating", being ultimately neutral and applicable to all.  \n\nFiat currency, on the other hand, has its value pegged to the underlying national economy it represents, and power over that respective system comes from control of the currency. The philosophy of these traditional currencies are tied to the philosophy of the system they represent.

For the love of disco, let me repeat:  It is not yet a currency.  It does not fulfill the three main requirements of a money to a high degree (medium of exchange; yes great.  store of value; not so great.  Unit of account; not at all . . . yet) And this unit of account aspect is key.  \n\nHow retarded or misleading can one be; to suggest that a commodity, or a would-be-money, is somehow fundamentally flawed, because it does not yet enjoy a great deal of liquidity and widespread adoption, or because it\'s exchange price with the current money is volatile!?

Anyhow, regardless of how you feel about anarchy. . . it does not change the fact that valuation of a commodity is either forced and enforced. . . or it is emergent on a market.  It takes time, to say the least.  It cannot happen all at once, and it is going to be a messy, ugly, fits-and-starts, snafus, highly dis-equitable distributions initially, frauds, thefts, evolution of best practices and safeguards, etc.  A process of getting a large segment of the population to not only wrap their heads around a new technology to some extent. . . but to build out infrastructure to make it easier to use, and to have a large enough network of people and businesses demanding and accepting bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin cannot exist without the blockchain. . . but the blockchain **is** bitcoin.  There is no separating the two.  The level of ignorance and/or dishonesty to not contemplate and comprehend this fact, before so vociferously decrying the money aspect of it, is staggering.  One particularly ridiculous inconsistency of his argument, is that the exact type of "separation" of Bitcoin and bitcoin which he insisted upon (for uses such as remittances which he gave the example of), are already in existence, by way of companies such as Coinbase and Bitpay, which he lambasted.  There is no such thing as the coin people!  It\'s a fucking ledger.  No community utilizing blockchain technology as a decentralized network (i.e. not a single entity utilizing it internally and later transferring fiat balances between branches), can make any use of changing entries in a ledger unless the shares or units **have value**.  If they have no value, then no remittance network is possible, because there is no objective metric by which the sender and receiver could possibly determine how many units of the blockchain ledger should be assigned to the particular amount of fiat being sent, and how much fiat should be received at the other end in correspondence to those units of blockchain ledger.  The blockchain must have value, and indeed the units must have price.  This is inseparable from most any use of blockchain technology.  People need to get over their centralized, give-it-to-me now thinking; and understand the price discovery period which is going on with bitcoin.  \n\nBitcoin has the network effect, which is growing, and it is that network (of people) who give value to the bitcoin network, and subsequently the shares of that finite amount of units internal to the ledger.

You owe it to yourself to more fully understand this amazing technology, and the economic and political implications of it\'s properties and usefulness.  Money is memory.  Money is societal memory.  Having control over the issuance of money is the ultimate power over society, and it is a power far too great to entrust to governments and central banks. \n\nPlease understand where this man\'s rhetoric is coming from:  Bitcoin "the payment network" alone, is not threatening to anybody.  Bitcoin as money, is extremely threatening to a lot of groups.  There is a concerted effort to distract from this much more important aspect of bitcoin and to try to neuter it into being only a payments network, but also stifle it\'s development into end-to-end use as it\'s own unit of account; as money.\n\nEDIT: thanks very much for the gold, whoever you are.': 146, ">Please go study economics. . .\n\nThe best thing about bitcoin is that you don't have to go and study government economics.

It has to be used if it is to have any value. Sold , obtained goods with, traded with etc this is how the market gives it the value...and this is how BTC will slowly be distributed.

The answer is they already do lol that is how a bank works. Im posting on my phone but you can check my comment history, i wrote about this in another thread recently if you are interested. \n\nYou either have distributed consensus through miners i.e bitcoin, or you have a central entity maintaining a ledger, i.e jpmorgan chase.

If we are being practical,\nWe must take into account the costs of acquiring bitcoin today which range depending on which exchange/method you use, but once you are in bitcoin the costs to move spots in the ledger is close to free.\n\nTo sum it up, banks have employees/oh to prevent double spending (sending the same money to two different parties) and bitcoin has the network of miners to prevent this.

A useful mental experiment is going back to 15 years ago or more, asking yourself how you would solve these problems and checking why the other approaches failed. It is trivial to recognize the merits of Bitcoin for those who had pondered about these before it existed.\n\nIncentives are important for something like Bitcoin to work. Actually the same incentives would be helpful for a lot of other things, so we\'ll see Bitcoin being used for things like anonymizing networks, mesh networks, storage networks and whatnot.
