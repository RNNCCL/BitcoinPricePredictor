Cheers.\n\nEdit: Upon re-reading your final paragraph, I see that you did in fact answer this question. My mistake.': 1, '\n>1) Most, if not all, of these products are manufactured by normal businesses that deal in some fiat currency. Thus, the vendor acts as much as a currency exchange than anything else.\n\nAs a manufacturer, why would I deal exclusively in BTC? \n\nFor FY 2014 only 4% of my sales were in BTC. Why would I tell 96% of my customers "no thanks, your legal tender is not accepted here". And inb4 someone says "why would someone buy *your* product with Bitcoin" (a common refrain when business owners talk about the proportionally low number of bitcoin sales they\'ve received), I\'m the same guy that posted the graphs of 2013 Bitcoin Black Friday surpassing fiat Black Friday sales by ~30%. I\'m the guy that\'s constantly publishing my BTC sales data. I\'m not some fiat shill (hell, I help moderate this very sub). \n\nBitcoin needs to be market competitive in a capitalist economy for businesses to see its utility, they aren\'t going to go out of their way to completely overhaul their processes, accounting, and basic logistical aspects of their supply chain simply to support a fledgeling "currency".\n\n\n\n \n> 2) At these vendors, products are priced in BTC based on their value in USD or some other fiat currency.\n\nLast week, a 1 BTC purchase would provide me with $222. Today, for the same purchase, I would receive $235. Cool, right? Not cool. Manufacturers (and most businesses for that matter) like consistency. We don\'t want to have to change our prices on a daily basis just so we can cover our costs. \n\nOh, and about that 1 BTC order? Had I received the order ~ 3 weeks ago, I would have received ~$300. Which means that if I held that BTC (as a business does with its assets), I would have lost 1/3 of the revenue from that sale. \n\nI\'m all for a BTC economy but we can\'t be naive and think that if we stick our fingers in our ears the existing economic system will cease to exist.\n\nIf a business were to price its goods in BTC how would it pay its suppliers as the value of Bitcoin fluctuates so wildly? Even if *all* the company\'s suppliers accepted BTC, there still will be fluctuations (this is a free market, after all) as the "real" value of Bitcoin moves to match the "real" value of any other global currency, and vice versa. \n': 2}, ('Private beta access to Trustatom Certificate API', 4): {}, ('this incident shows the problem in a form extends generally to fiat currencies internationally and that fiat currency is an unsuitable medium for even businesses as specialized in its handling as banks', 3): {}, ('Translating Goldman Sachs Top Recommended Trades for 2015 into Bitcoin Derivative Macro Trades', 10): {}, ('Has anyone else had this problem with Trezor?

I mean, currently we expect everything, all the time. Our Keyensian overlords\' whole debt model insists on this. Though our future economy could evolve into something more small scale, more village-like, with less emphasis on human manufacturing jobs due to automation, and more emphasis on quality workmanship where humans can provide such a thing. \n\nUse of Bitcoin with its protocol enforcing a smooth, predictable, yet decreasing production rate would help to scale down this ridiculous boom-bust debt model that we currently endure... allowing us to adapt into a scaled down economy of automation, and decentralization, whereas now, we insist on inflating everything everywhere with the hopes that future productivity and capitalization will melt away all of the debt that we are taking on. It won\'t. I don\'t see milllenials amenable to working that way in the future. \n\nI see them working less, not more. I see productivity taking a downward turn, and emphasis on living conditions and health, research and entertainment. Look at Japan and their youth. What does this teach us?\n\nThe most difficult transition to this economy will be convincing the 20th century modelers that the debt-inflation model doesn\'t work anymore. That automation will take jobs away, that we need to retool everything to adapt to a more deflationary economy that is predictable, and sustainable.

But not everywhere.\n\nThe one thing that does concern me is that there are psychological factors why people prefer institutional environments: it gives them stability, it gives them a constant social environment, and particularly importantly it gives them a guaranteed sense of progress. I think decentralized economic systems if they are to succeed long-term will need to provide effective substitutes for these needs. Reputation systems may be a large part of the solution here.

Free market competition would lead to much lower fees, but, for that reason, the market is unlikely to remain free.

That\'s fine; keep asking questions.\n\nExchanges only exchange bitcoins for other currencies. They are not needed for transacting in Bitcoin. They can ask any fee they want but if they ask too much, people will simply go to a cheaper exchange.\n\nIf Bitcoin "blew up", there wouldn\'t be a need to use exchanges for most people most of the time. You would simple receive bitcoins as (part of) your salary and use those to pay for anything you want. In any case, the fee per transaction would never be a percentage but always a fixed amount per transaction.': 2, 'There needs to be a distinction between transacting with Bitcoin directly and transacting through a third party.\n\nIf third party service or software (Bitpay, Coinbase, Wallets, etc.) wish to start charging 2%, 3%, 5%, etc. for their services through transaction or processing fees they can rightly do-so.\n\nBitcoin cannot arbitrarily start enforcing higher transaction fees without coming to general consensus on the network. The chances of this happening are, of course, slim to none.': 2, "I expect that, at the free market equilibrium, (1) miners will demand a fee only a little less than PayPal's, and (2) the ROI of each miner will be just enough to keep him mining. \n\nThus, (1) the entry of a new miner will increase the difficulty and make mining unprofitable for everybody, including the newcomer; and (2) if a miner starts accepting lower fees, although he will make more money at first, other miners will be forced to accept lower fees too, some users will start paying lower fees than they used to, the total revenue of all miners will drop, and mining will become unprofitable for everybody.\n\nAs mining becomes unprofitable, some miners will pull out until the equilibrium is restored; but if the fee percentage is lower, the total revenue of the miners will be lower, even though it is still profitable. \n\nSo, it seems that the miners will be motivated to form a cartel and fix the prices.

The sweet spot is the highest fee that still allows Bitcoin to capture most of the world market for transactions. I assume that's quite a low fee.\n\nAlso, collusion might become difficult if Bitcoin miners come to have a dual-use as space heaters. More altruism could then enter the picture, as the revenue difference between a cartelized and non-cartelized mining industry for someone operating hashing space heater would be minimal.
