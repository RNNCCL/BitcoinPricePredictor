That was really helpful. I wasn't aware of the mechanics of how multisig accounts were evaluated.\n\nThe reason I was asking about reusing addresses in multiple multisig accounts is because it opens up some powerful possibilities for corporate/group accounts, among other things. The ability to use the same private key for multiple accounts allows people to mutate the number of account holders and move money around without having to assign everyone a new key each time - they just need the new hashing script, if I'm not mistaken.": 1, 'you still need the correct redeem script': 1, 'the redeem script is sort of like the "public key" for a multisig address.  it\'s what gets hashed when you create the address.  (so even similar messages have hashes that are entirely different.)  and it\'s what you need to show in order to spend the money.  miners verify it by hashing it to make sure it results in the hash of the address you\'re trying to spend, and then they verify that you\'ve met the requirements outlined by that script.  a 4-of-4 redeem script is basically a script that says "4 of the following 4 keys are necessary to spend this money".  so a 4-of-4 address and a 4-of-7 address would be totally different addresses, with different redeem scripts, even though the same 4 private keys could spend from either address.  the 4-of-7 address requirements were different, so it\'s a different address.  it just so happens that the same four private keys could also satisfy its requirements, but so could one of those four along with three other keys that couldn\'t be used in the 4-of-4 address.  different requirements, different redeem scripts.': 1, 'What?  No-- well, yes, sort of.  I mean, you can have a 4-of-4 address, and then just use those same keys in a different 4-of-7 address.\n\nLook at OP\'s redeem script:\n\n    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\n\nI\'ll break it down.  It\'s actually really simple.\n\n    54:  This stands for OP_4, e.g. the number of sigs required.\n         That is, it\'s the first "4" in 4-of-4\n    41:  The length in bytes of the first public key.\n         130 chars is 65 bytes, which is 0x41 in hexidecimal\n    \n    04f8bb4a6de395b21b1593dde086549801496bd4fc9c88bb351ee056049a1e4a80505b402a083ec5cc0444d096ca2db15ef3c3883e5e6e9d6a9f0caadc21ccca7f\n\nThis (04f8bb4a.....) is the first of the four public keys.  If you take the first (Raiders) private key and derive the public key, this is the public key you get.  If you sha256 hash its hex and then ripemd160 hash that result, you get the first address (in hex from not base58).\n\nThen after that first address is:\n\n    41\n    049d61bc8e379c22032c754619a45e0ccfcfd4e7147acd70658f5ad64e02673c40cbf403695bda9b1c9467f5f98a423f487503119a20b26e1a123e9d4811860f6a\n    41\n    04524c7eb81d3e5f779c2f3d99fc835aa2f162d1ca75ae874cd4054d388f60beb99e9626f082ab0c8b1b3dab37c93e6766986694f3203f662a94e4e02fa0a1dc18\n    41\n    042107cd854e09833738c65e859b9b9713b594f1873a75b57fa2428b1c43e0a1ae6a9d46325ce193d271b9bb224351b9a92d80c552e52bcb6ac6a5f6fea5c7421b\n    \n    54:  This is the number of total keys.  The second 4 in 4-of-4.\n    ae:  OP_CHECKMULTISIG.  Sees if there are the right number of signatures.\n\nAnd that\'s the entire reddem script.  The number of keys required, then the keys prefixed by how long they are, followed by how many keys that should have been entered, followed by CHECKMULTISIG.\n\nIf you want to change that to a 4-of-7, you simply tack on more keys (prefixed by their length), and change the last 54 (third and fourth letters from the end) to a 57 to indicate 7 keys, and bam you have a new 4-of-7 address.\n\nI will do that now.  I will create three new random keys and make a perfectly valid redeem script that takes those first four keys as the first four of seven keys listed.  See if you are able to pick out the last three and understand how it\'s all put together.\n\n    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\n\nThat\'s a valid redeem script.  If we sha256 hash it, we get:\n\n    d01ce48e36f55fadf7bf9c50e47fbe95bc2752ea14259c039b677057aafecb6f\n\nand if we ripemd160 hash that, we get:\n\n    0d8748a219c9199faeac30b6a29474f9efb871df\n\nMultisig addresses have a prefix of "05".  So it looks liek this:\n\n    050d8748a219c9199faeac30b6a29474f9efb871df\n\nBase58 encoding is just like any other base conversion.  It\'s no different than changing decimal (base 10) to binary (base 2).  Base 58 just uses letters in addtion to numbers to make it so a single character can represent more data.  Just like "f" is 16 in hex.  Base58 is like base-64 but without capitol O\'s and lowercase "L" and one or two other letters that look like other letters-- it was chosen by Satoshi specifically to make typos less likely.  Bitcoin protocol specifcation also says that you add a checksum of the data you are encoding, which means when you decode it back into hex, you can hash it and check the checksum and verify that no typos happened.  This is done by sha256-hashing the data twice, and adding the first 8 characters of the sha256 hash onto the end of the hex.  So our hex of:\n\n    050d8748a219c9199faeac30b6a29474f9efb871df\n\nif we hash that, and then hash that resulting hash, and then take the first 8 letters, which are "fc234468", we get a final hex of:\n\n    050d8748a219c9199faeac30b6a29474f9efb871dffc234468\n\nwhich we can convert from base16 (hex) to base58 as:\n\n    32vYmiT181xUDecbTW3L1gk7fi7YfLfMcB\n\nWhich is the multisig address for that new 4-of-7 redeem script I made.  So any money sent to that can be spent by those same 4 private keys that were in the OP.\n\nAlso, the 05 prefix doesn\'t just stand for multisig.  It stands for any P2SH address, which is short for "pay to script hash".  Multisig scripts require checking and validating signatures, but other scripts can be used as well.  Any redeem script that evaluates to true when run can spend money.  For example, you could have a redeem script that simply says "TRUE" which in bitcoin scripting is "51".  That\'s the entire redeem script: 51.  If you do all the hashing and conversions on that, you arrive at the address of [3MaB7QVq3k4pQx3BhsvEADgzQonLSBwMdj](https://blockchain.info/address/3MaB7QVq3k4pQx3BhsvEADgzQonLSBwMdj) which you can see actually has had transactions on it.  Anybody can spend money in that address because no signatures are required.  The script always evaluates to true.': 2, 'Elaborate.': 1, 'A multisig adress can be setup to require as many or as few keys as you like.

Patrick Byrne = Literally Hitler.': 2, 'First, to all: Thanks for the kind words.\n\nNow, Jaydoors: Great question. The plumbing is designed as follows. In the situation you describe, there would be 90 shares short. Thus, investors would own the 10 shares the company had issued along with the 90 the shorts had created. When the company pays a $1/share dividend ($10), it goes into a pot at the DTCC. Everyone who is short has to come up with $1/share themselves ($90). Those all get paid into a different pot in the DTCC. Then the $100 in the two pots are pumped out to the 100 people who think they own a share. Since everyone gets $1, none of them can tell whether they own one of the real shares or one of the fake shares.\n\nBut actually, there is a way, but almost nobody knows it. If you are getting a $1 from the company, that is indeed a dividend, and you should pay the normal tax rate on dividends (15%). However, if you hold one of the shares that was manufactured by the system, your $1 check will come marked with a little "PIL" on it. That stands for "Payment In Lieu" (of an real dividend). Technically, the tax rate on that PIL is your ordinary income tax rate (probably 36% or so). In my experience with investors, essentially no one knows this, and so they pay at the 15% rate. Which means, technically, that the IRS is getting cheated. If they ever enforced this distinction (which I have never heard of them doing, and in fact, it is not clear to me that the IRS understands this stuff any better than the SEC) and people did have to pay differential tax rates, then it would mean that the two kinds of shares were not truly fungible, and they would therefore be worth different amounts. Maybe the reason the IRS does not enforce this is because there is a lot riding on people not understanding that the stock market is a game of fractional reserve banking without a reserve requirement.\n\nBest,\nPatrick\n\nNow the disclaimers and fine print: I am not a lawyer or CPA, and have no business giving tax or legal advice.

You only find out if you actually own it if you try to get it, physically.  But with stocks and bonds, wouldn\'t this creation of non-existent assets be revealed in payment of dividends?  Eg if a company makes $10 of profits, decides to pay it all as dividends, and returns it to each of 10 shares, they\'d each get $1.  But if actually there were 100 shares, because of dematerialisation, they\'d get $0.1.  All this must be in the company\'s accounts.  \n\nAnyone know about this?

Especially seeing as it drops about 5% a week in value. What you need is someone in Venezuela who can actually use VEF to make a profit (in real terms not just VEF terms). For example someone mining BTC in Venezuela could pay their energy costs in VEF at the subsidized rate and 'produce' BTC which they could sell on your exchange to recoup the VEF to pay operating costs. I don't think your problem is a lack of market makers, it's that no one is willing to take the long VEF position because everyone knows it is going to depreciate rapidly. VEF is only good for consumption, which if you don't live in Venezuela you can't do as VEF buys nothing outside the country. You need remittance where people send $ earnings in BTC back to Venezuela and sell them for VEF that their family members then consume, or exporters who can get things out of Venezuela and sell them for $ and BTC. So scenario 2 goes like this (reverse of what Chinese do with Hong Kong) Exporter sells goods made in Venezuela to outsiders. They invoice the customer 20% of the actual price and hand those dollars over to the government. The government gives them VEF at the official rate 6:1. They then invoice the customer for the other 80% in Bitcoins. They sell the bitcoins for VEF on the exchange at the black market 125:1 rate.

You have more than a single point of failure to worry about, because there are many different certificate authorities who have been hacked in the past to issue fake (but totally valid) certificates.  \n\nIn regards to OPs gripes I think the solution is simple, organizations like Seans outpost should have well known and widely published PGP keys and be part of a Web Of Trust (like the one for #bitcoin-otc). This key can be used to sign a message that says something to the effect of "Seans outpost bitcoin address is: 1M72Sfpbz1BPpXFHz9m3CdqATR44Jvaydd" With a date and time. A MITM attact can\'t defeat PGP with a web of trust.

Blockstream has said those units become unshackled from the restrictions of the 10 min confirmation times, the publicity of addresses, script limitations, etc.  They "say" they only want to research improvements to Bitcoin itself.  when in fact, they might just want to be paid alot of USD\'s for constructing SC\'s.\n\n"they", meaning the investors and Blockstream devs, may be doing it knowingly or unknowingly.  we\'ll never know.': 1, "i agree that in theory, if SC's were perfect 2wp's with 100% MM, then they could be used as research tools.  but with Bitcoin being already almost perfect money, there might at most be 2 SC's that i would use: fast tx's and anonymity.  beyond that, i don't see a need for anymore.\n\nenter Blockstream. they have a financial incentive to sell all sorts of speculative SC's that enable long term asset speculation like stocks, bond, insurance, even gvt currencies.  this isn't debatable; they've said this is what they want to do.  therefore, given that the Bitcoin network can and should only be MM'ing those 2 utility chains for fast tx and anon, the rest will be insecure.  \n\nthen why make them?  b/c the $21M in investment money needs a 10x return.  on top of that, Blockstream has an incentive to make these speculative SC's attract as many BTC as possible; otherwise these clients will be unhappy they paid for them in the first place.  this is an existential risk to Bitcoin as it destroys its sound money function.": 2, "Why wouldn't merge mined SC's have the potential to have utility, assuming all of the problems are solved that is?": 1, '> So my point is, why bother worrying about it? \n\ni worry that somehow they, Blockstream, is able to get the spvp into the source code b/c everybody just says "don\'t worry about it".  why would that be a concern?  b/c it would show the market that a group of insiders could abuse their position (40% of core devs + 3 top committers) to insert what is in essence a political (includes financial motives) slice of code that is specifically designed to facilitate its business model at the expense of competitors (like Bitshares, CP, Ethereum, all altcoins).  that would be a bad message to send and, imo, decrease confidence in Bitcoin itself as a an impartial, apolitical new age form of sound money.  \n\nnote there are 2 parts there:  the financial conflict of interest of the spvp and what i consider the breakage of the sound money function of Bitcoin (breakage of the link btwn currency unit and its BC).': 1, 'You should be more concerned about the centralization of core dev that Blockstream brings.

Bottom line is BlockStream really doesn't have a fully baked cake at this point.  \n\nNon-merge mined SC's are inferior to regular alt-coins in every way.  They are vulnerable to 51% and other attacks because they don't have the scale and infrastructure behind their mining, and if they are attacked, the option to hard fork is out - because the non-merge mined SC's units will have been unfrozen to bitcoin and are out of the SC.  Also, they only enable SPV level proof where a full alt coin could do much more.  I see non-merge mined SC's as, well, stupid.  Why would someone want to use one?  It's better to just go try and build yourself an ethereum and fund it on a website.\n\nThe only area I didn't necessarily agree with was that SPV offramps to merge mined SC's are bad.  \n\nSay we have a two way peg to ScamCoin ^TM.  Alex Karpeles and Mark Green are partners and convince people to peg up 10,000 BTC over to the ScamCoin ^TM merge mined sidechain.  The convertibility of ScamCoin ^TM back and forth to bitcoin pegs it to bitcoin.  ScamCoin ^TM is backed by bitcoin, minus the risk in trusting Alex Karpeles and Mark Green's SC is safe.  \n\nThis is precisely like how the petrodollar is the world's reserve currency because all petrol / oil is traded on exchanges that only accept payment in USD.  This creates demand for the dollar, and cements it as the reserve currency of the world.  \n\nSimilarly if I want more ScamCoin ^TM, or to convert back to Bitcoin, I can do so freely.   Because the mining system behind ScamCoin ^TM is the same as Bitcoin, the infrastructure and hash power network effect are shared and symbiotic.\n\nWhere I would have a problem, is if the two way peg to a SC allowed the SC to create BTC - allowing more to reenter the parent network after being mined / created in the SC.  That's unacceptable and creates an inflationary leak into Bitcoin.  \n\nAs long as the SC cannot return more bitcoin than was originally pegged, I don't understand the big scary with the convertibility aspect. \n\nI do have issues with the approach for SC's.  I don't think the peg schemes are safe, I think there could be fraudulent transactions, and I think that even with an excessively long peg lock time (I may have the jargon wrong), there are still some valid concerns around forking.\n\nI'm not really a huge fan of SC's, but I'm not scared of them.

How would that help?\n\nMP's wages are very debatable, especially when MP's themselves were pushing austerity and wage freezes across the public sector. \n\nThe use of that image is actually really disingenuous because [the majority of the MP's and all the party leaders came out **against** a pay rise..](http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/jul/11/david-cameron-rejects-mps-pay-rise-proposal) \n\nAnd [here's the article the image is from, published the same day..](http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/jul/11/mps-pay-rise-proposal-explained)\n\nIn fact, MP's wages aren't even decided by MP's any more.
