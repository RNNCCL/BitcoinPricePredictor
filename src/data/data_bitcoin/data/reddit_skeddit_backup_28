Right now the code is all lumped together and is difficult to check.  An feature introduced in one part could cause security issues elsewhere.

Some apps are **not** supposed to make payments or shouldn\'t make payments to a random address that wasn\'t whitelisted explicitly. For instance if I use a bot plugin to do arbitrage between exchange accounts, it should only be able to send funds between designated exchange accounts. It should be possible to have that level of restriction if the user wants it. That way the user can just download any plugin and still be sure that nothing can happen that he hasn\'t approved explicitely.\n\nOf course there are use cases where it wouldn\'t be practical but in that case the user should be requested to approve explicitely such behavior and the sandbox layer should still have a pop up to approve payment (with a "don\'t show this again" tick box of user really wants to trust entirely the plugin).\n\n>> All that a plugin should be able to do is ask the Bitcoin module to craft and send a transaction\n\n>That\'s exactly how that would work.

When you hit retirement age, you can take out money at your tax rate in the future (theory being you are earning less, so you will be at a lower tax threshold.)\n\nSo say you have $10k of income to invest.  If you buy bitcoin directly that income is taxed, which I think is what you were trying to account for with your 20-30% premium.  If you put it in traditional 401k, you aren't.\n\nHowever, you are missing the longer term effects.  First, instead of having $7k of bitcoin in play, you have $10k.  Second, if you do decide to sell your bitcoin before retirement, you aren't paying taxes on any gains, and you can use the full amount of those gains to invest in something else.  Third, when you do pay taxes on those gains, they may be lower.\n\nNow the even more interesting one for GBTC / bitcoin is the Roth IRA.  For these, you put after-tax money in, the gains grow tax free AND when you withdraw after age of 59.5, you don't pay taxes.\n\nSo in that case, the benefits of a high risk investment in bitcoin - even at the premium commanded by GBTC -  could be huge (but obviously also lots of risk).": 5, "So uhm, there's a premium?

Yes, these 5% always retain their proportional value of the total company valuation. If you buy 1% of the stake, you will always own 1% of the company,min you don't pull out the cash you have a right to.\n\nThe examples I wrote to try to explain this:\n\nIf we sell 2,000 BTC in this first round, that means we sell 2,000 tokens, for a total valuation of 2,000/%5 = 40,000 bitcoin and 40,000 tokens. If next round we sell 20% and raise 12,000 BTC, which would make the new company value 12,000/20%=60,000, that means the company value grew by 1.5, and everyone who bought the 5% at 1 BTC will get the right to receive an extra 0.5 BTC. So of the 12,000 BTC we raise, 1,000 BTC will be offered to be redistributed to the original investors. The token itself will always be valued (by us, not the market) at the amount you initially paid for (in USD at the May 18th exchange rate). But the token will grant you the right to increases in company valuation on top of it. So in the example here, your total value is 1.5 BTC, with 1 BTC being the token itself and 0.5 being either cash sitting in our company that we owe you (it belongs to you, just like owning a stock share means a part of company assets belongs to you), or as cash you can pull out and hold yourself.\n\nThink of it this way. When you buy an actual real share of stock, that makes you an actual literal owner of a part of the company. You actually own the right to a part of the equipment, cash, etc. The company can offer to buy back your share by giving you a portion of company cash, which you own, in exchange for that share. It works the same way here, where the token grants you ownership of a part of the company, including equipment and cash, but instead of us offering to buy back the stock share in exchange for the cash you already own, you can just ask for that cash yourself.\n\nHope this helps": 1, 'Great idea, I will contribute in a similar fashion.\n\n$100 USD is reasonable?
