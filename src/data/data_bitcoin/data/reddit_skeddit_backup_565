They\'re also adverse parties to one another in the moo bankruptcy and civil matter, yet supposedly have the same attorney (ahem, holy conflict of interest). They might even need some cash right now (more motive, see the first motive).  Backs can be scratched. Alternatively, they\'d probably like questions about their moo involvement to stop.
