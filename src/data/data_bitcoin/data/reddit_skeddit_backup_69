Some minors purposely create smaller blocks so they propagate faster.  So even if the block size does increase it does not mean miners will immediately fill them up.  No easy answers.': 0, 'A lie from /u/seweso can make it halfway around the world before the truth can get its pants on.\n\n> If there\xe2\x80\x99s 1.5M of transactions every 10 minutes, why not just create a block every five minutes? The answer is: because it takes an average of around 10 minutes to perform the computation needed to add one block to the chain. So you can\xe2\x80\x99t reduce the amount of time per block.\n\nNot correct. The computation adjusts to the hashing power of participants\n\n> This is a problem on many levels. If you\xe2\x80\x99re a store trying to sell things, and people want to pay with Bitcoin, this is a massive problem. Up until a transactions is confirmed by being part of a block accepted into the blockchain, the transaction can be rescinded. So you can\xe2\x80\x99t give your customers their merchandise until you\xe2\x80\x99re sure the transaction is in the blockchain. That was awkward when you had to wait 10 minutes. That\xe2\x80\x99s completely unacceptable when you have no idea how long it might take.\n\nVery very few IRL stores accept Bitcoin. And they weren\'t making you wait around ten minutes - which can actually be up to two or three hours because of normal variance. And if you tested any normal client which used a slightly higher fee due to the spam attack, it would have gone through in 100% normal time.\n\n> But that\xe2\x80\x99s where the social/political thing comes in. The work of performing the computation needed to add blocks to the chain (called mining) has become concentrated in the hands of a small group of people. And they don\xe2\x80\x99t want to change the mining software that they\xe2\x80\x99re running. ... But as an outsider, it looks like a pretty typical thing: people prefer to stick with known profits today even if it kills the business tomorrow, rather than take a risk of losing todays profits.\n\nThey just changed to 0.12. This "known profits today" thing makes no sense, they make their profits from block rewards, fees are 1% of their revenue.\n\n> The problem is, 1MB really isn\xe2\x80\x99t that much space. Even if just 1/3 of the transactions are fast, you\xe2\x80\x99re going to wind up with times when you can\xe2\x80\x99t do all of the pending fast transactions in one block. So fast transactions need to increase their fees. But that can only go on for so long before the cost of using bitcoin starts to become a significant issue in the cost of doing business.\n\nEven 10 mb isn\'t that much space. That\'s why this isn\'t a good long term scalable solution\n\n> Realistically, if you want to use bitcoin as a currency, you can\xe2\x80\x99t solve its capacity problems without increasing its capacity. If there are more than 1MB of transactions happening every 10 minutes, then you need to do something to increase the number of transactions that can be part of a block. If not, then you can\xe2\x80\x99t support the number of transactions that people want to make. If that\xe2\x80\x99s the case, then you can\xe2\x80\x99t rely on being able to use bitcoin to make a purchase \xe2\x80\x93 and that means that you don\xe2\x80\x99t have a usable currency.\n\nIncorrect: you just can\'t rely on using Bitcoin to be a super low fee way of making a purchase. You can rely on getting in the next block, if you pay the fee. The current fastest fee https://bitcoinfees.21.co/ is $0.027.

While not perfect, a very high level of democracy is assured. And once voted on, the decision is enforced by a number of procedures and checks that prevent a reversal from happening ten minutes later. \n\nOn the other hand you have Bitcoin. And Bitcoin has no formal procedures, it works as an anarchy powered by an enormous special interest (miners). Indeed Bitcoin can't even call for a date for a vote, it's got no deadlines, its got no checks and balances, no formal procedures, and no vote is final (so reversal can happen ten seconds later), and no one even knows how to provide a clear framework for the discussion.\n\nSure we've got the concept that half of the miners have to agree and then a policy is adopted. But what the hell does that mean when it seems very possible that 80% of the mining these days are controlled by one person or one cabal. That's the antithesis of a democracy. That's oligarchy or worse. Its bullshit. \n\nSo my comparing Bitcoin to the global community trying to fight climate change is a much better analogy. Why? Because the countries of the world are bound together by little more than special interests and anarchy. There are no enforceable obligations.

Is it just to raise the market cap? Low value-high-velocity isn't actually a great way to do that...": 1, "There are some interesting calculations you are using here, but generally I agree that the value of the blockchain is in fact directly proportionate to the security of bitcoin.  You will not see valuable assets being secured, or monetized on the blockchain when the underlying value of the securing protocol is significantly less than the asset itself. These numbers go hand in hand.  By increasing the value of the underlying chain, we continue to open the field for additional asset layers.\n\nIt's a fallacy to assume that the value of bitcoin has to already achieve critical mass to allow for ANY transfer of value, timestamping, or digitizing of assets.  Transfer of value can still occur, but will be limited to the asset value that the existing currency/chain can support.  \n\nA very simple example is to look at the current market cap of bitcoin, roughly $6.2b.  It's easy to support the purchase of a coffee, or even a car.  Suddenly it gets far more complicated when you are talking about much larger value transfer, for example the purchase of a company.  Could Tesla purchase a tire manufacturer for $2b using bitcoin? The answer would be no.  Would Facebook have been able to purchase WhatsApp for $19b? Obviously not given that the purchase value far exceeds the existing market value.\n'\nTake this example to the next level and assume that we have listed equities that settle on the blockchain.  In our hypothetical listing, Facebook is listed via Nasdaq and it's public shares trade and settle on the bitcoin blockchain.  FB carries a valuation of roughly $300b.   FB conducts an all equity buyout of WhatsApp for $19b and existing equity shareholders for WhatsApp receive $19b worth of FB stock which is settled via the blockchain.  This transactions far exceed the underlying value of the chain they settle on and would present ample opportunity for attacker to attempt to disrupt the transaction.  It is entirely plausible that these settlements could still occur, but there is additional risk to settlement on a chain where it's value is far less than the assets as this compromises potential security.\n\nFor the meantime we will continue to see the value of settlements and transactions rise as the price of bitcoin rises. These two go hand in hand and create a positive feedback loop.  There is no reason to stop development on one process or another, the value is derived from the usage that the bitcoin and the blockchain can provide.  The more settlements and smart contracts that can occur on the blockchain, the more value that is implied in the underlying currency and the chain itself causing a price increase.  Increased price in bitcoin creates additional trust and security, bringing more settlements and smart contracts.  This will occur in a positive feedback loop until some sort of parity is reached.\n\nThanks for your analysis.": 34, "They'll invest because the price is going up.

Since the currency owned by the "losers"  *may* have less value after a particular decision, the decision is claimed to be unethical because larceny was committed. \n\nThe reason why this conclusion is false and not larceny is that a currency offers no guarantee of future value to any holder (or if there is a guarantee, it\'s only as good as the word of the issuer).  If there is no guarantee of value, it is not larceny if the value of a currency declines any more than it would be larceny if the value of a stock declined.\n\nGranted, a currency that is routinely mismanaged will fall in value over time.  Also, it is generally a good idea for a currency to be managed in a way that is *fairly* consistent over time and aligned with the expectations of the holders.  However, that does not mean that a change in policy direction is larceny or that a currency would never benefit from a change in policy direction.\n\nA currency gains in value relative to other currencies not because it never changes any policies (forks), but because over time it\'s changes (or lack of changes) are preferred by currency holders over competing alternatives.\n \nCurrency is a social construct and has value only because others agree that it has value and will accept it in trade.  Any currency widely used will be held by millions of people.  The idea or expectation that any change must achieve unanimous agreement (consensus) from all holders is not only unwise for the value of the currency and its role in society, but impossible in the first place.': 3, 'Who pays you to do development?': 6, 'Very good article.

It planned to consider a fresh offer after a so-called block halving later in the year when the value of bitcoin is expected to move sharply, it said.\n\nBitcoin Group\xe2\x80\x99s offering would have been the first IPO in Australia of a bitcoin miner--one of the independent computer owners who confirm and process transactions in the currency, and are compensated with freshly issued bitcoins that add to the global supply. Another bitcoin miner, now known as DigitalX Ltd., joined the ASX in early 2014 following the reverse takeover of listed Macro Energy Ltd.\n\nThe Melbourne-based company had already resubmitted its IPO prospectus twice since its was first filed with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission in June 2015, after the regulator first rejected a financial forecast then questioned the reasonableness of its bitcoin mining model. After months of delays, the IPO closed on Jan. 25, having raised just over 5.9 million Australian dollars (US$4.4 million).\n\nA spokesman for ASX Ltd., operator of the country\xe2\x80\x99s main exchange, confirmed the company had been notified it had yet to satisfy listing requirements, namely demonstrating it had enough working capital to carry out its objectives.\n\nIn a letter to Bitcoin Group Chief Executive Sam Lee, released to the market Monday, ASX said a report supplied by the company indicated a base-case scenario whereby the company would need a further capital injection beyond September 2017.\n\nBitcoin Group said the independent accountant the ASX required it to hire to prepare the working capital report was required to factor in the reduction of newly minted bitcoins with the expected \xe2\x80\x9cblock halving\xe2\x80\x9d this year but without taking into account an expected increase in the bitcoin price.\n\nIt said that the last time block halving occurred in November 2012, the price increased in value by more than 1,000% in the following six months. The number of bitcoins that can be generated is limited by design, and once every four years the number of bitcoins that can be mined every 10 minutes is cut in half.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnfortunately, ASIC prohibited any forecasting on the bitcoin price which resulted in a report which did not allow for any increase in bitcoin price upon the number of bitcoins available to be mined halving in July 2016,\xe2\x80\x9d it said.\n\nThe company said its intention is to push ahead with an IPO after allowing time for the price of the digital currency to reflect the reduced number of bitcoins being released, which is expected by September.': 1}, ('Bitcoin mentioned by Lewis Black on The Daily Show.', 2): {'No': 1, "Ya, I didn't even pick up on that.

Representative democracy has consistently given us the most stable and prosperous societies in the history of the world.

We are all members of dozens of different special interest groups - the group of parents or latinos or doctors or city-dwellers etc, and a large portion of us look to increase our share of the pie via the political system.  Similarly, when people try to talk about the benefits of laissez-faire capitalism, I point out that the very rich aren\'t capitalists at heart, they\'re simply self-interested(and I don\'t mean that in a bad way.)  As they accumulate substantial money, they will inevitably use that money to shape the political sphere to benefit themselves - this takes the form of "regulatory capture" for example.  \n\nWhenever I have debates like this - I find that people want to separate economics, politics, and psychology.  You can\'t.  The 3 are intertwined.  Communism can\'t work because people are self-interested by nature and always will be, and I suspect that anarchic systems can\'t work because every special interest group wants bigger government that will shift some of the pie to them.  I work in finance (and firmly identify as a capitalist), but usually find myself arguing that some degree of regulation and redistribution is critical for capitalism to work successfully because of political and psychological realities.': 1, 'Defensive decentralization!': 2, "Without the mining power the whole thing would collapse.

These countries have geopolitical problems that are older than that. Want to know why Ukraine is such a mess?

Some would die fighting, but probably a majority would give up sooner or later.": 1, '"History doesn\'t repeat itself, but it does rhyme."\n\nSo Bitcoin in its early stages was highly decentralized, that set the stage, it made the environment fertile, it protected the fragile being that Bitcoin was (and it was more fragile than it is now, you can be sure of that). Decentralization gives us all the feeling that its a new frontier, as an example, the early United States. The United States utilized decentralization early on to allow itself to grow and overcome its issues in a very dangerous world. The operating emotion here is fear (of the unknown) but also excitement for the growth potential, and so naturally there will be overcompensation. Decentralization invigorates the people because decentralization creates an environment ideal for smaller operations to thrive, a lot gets done.\n\nWhen a lot gets done, resources pile up, when resources pile up, all those smaller operations need to (or feel the need to) find ways to utilize all this surplus, and things become a bit reckless due the new operating emotion of greed, and the worry that things can\'t go well forever. And so, it leads to centralization. Not every small operation within the system can continue to churn out surplus, so competition ramps up, merging occurs, scarcity is perceived, efficiency becomes important, governance naturally becomes more strict and overreaching as a function of business interests and certain individuals accumulating massive wealth over time (and having to deal with massive feelings of greed and the paranoia that comes with it). The system consolidates itself, it becomes tighter, and easier to control by those who have the power to control it.\n\nSo Bitcoin isn\'t immune to this, its nature, doesn\'t matter what the code dictates, because there are further systems built on top, social systems that heavily involve the old human monkey mind hierarchy system. There\'s nothing wrong with this either, it\'s normal evolution. The United States continued to grow exponentially despite its shift from decentralization to centralization. It can take a long time before self destruction and real decay sets in, so long as the "arms" are ultimately centralized properly, usually through trial and error, so that existential threats can be dealt with, this space will be prosperous, so long as you understand how to operate within it.\n\nMost of us here are mainly interested in profit, or other forms of self interest, that\'s totally normal, we all just need to understand that if we want to operate in this system, we have to go with the flow, position ourselves (and technically, even altcoins are linked to the Bitcoin system, it should be understood), and fight for the best outcomes we can. The ship WILL become harder to change course as it grows from a small boat to a titanic ship, and not everyone on it will have an equal place on the ship, and the ship can either reach its destination and many more, or crash into an iceberg and sink. That all depends on how the Bitcoin system can deal with the increasing pressure of existential threats as it rises on the pecking order.': 1, "I agree with the statement, it aids in the theory that we still don't know what the best government or social systems for all are, considering someone is always left behind.\n\nAny proof on the disclaimer?": 2, '> The state will always be able to out-gun you\n\nThe state has lost violent conflicts many times throughout history.

In Bitcoin, believing that people are here to make the world a better place is a great position to take... if you want to get scammed.\n\nThe default position should be to ask hard questions of those who are wanting to sell you something.

Your asset should have some utility (like with SOG assets which are playing card tokens). What Adam and team should consider doing is siloing their coins and letting users export them upon need. Adam Levine regularly complains about the cost of being greater than 50% of the counterparty network, and he could easily solve this by simply asking users to accumulate Adambucks, and then paying a small output to export the value when they need to (like to send it to an exchange or to pay for an ad).The process would look like this: you log in to LTB, you go to the page where your balance is displayed, you hit export, a QR code pops up with a text field for you to put the wallet address you want the coins sent to, and you use any other wallet to pay a small amount for the export of the value.

There are no engineers (apart from those with corporate interests) who believe there is any issue with raising the blocksize. There is no blindly being convinced. The block size was always meant to be increased, and there is no, *no* relevant technical argument against it. This has been discussed at length and the only engineers for small blocks are core. There are no respected non core engineers that see any technical reason to\nNot increase. The arguments for small blocks is to create a fee market and to turn Bitcoin into a settlement layer. It is political/business decision. There is no need for Bitcoin to be a settlement layer. Block stream could easily use a new blockchain for that, but then where do they get their user base? They are hijacking Bitcoin. You are uninformed or naive if you think otherwise.": 1, 'I think the words "competing" and "teams" are wrong for any open source project.  For a successful open source project, you need a two things (at least): a knowledgeable and selfless leader, one who understands the vision of the project and makes the big decisions; and contributing developers.\n\nIf you look at the Linux kernel, which I believe to be the most successful open source project to date, you will find Linus Torvalds at the top, the lieutenants under him that he appointed (and that share his vision), and the thousands of contributing developers doing most of the work.\n\nIs there any reason why bitcoin development can\'t follow a similar model to Linux kernel development?  Is it that there are so many different visions for the project that no leader can be agreed upon?': 1, "You can't have \xe2\x80\x9ccompeting development teams\xe2\x80\x9d for a software project.

That is what has always happened in the open source world if a group develops within a project that disagrees with the path the main development team is taking.\n\nThis is a *strength* of open source software - that someone can take the code and fork it. If you want to apply Balaji's quote to this situation then yes, open source always gives you a choice of new leaders by following them to a new project from a fork of the code.": -14, 'There is no reason why a single team cannot work under this model of course. There is also nothing stopping anyone from forking the Linux source code, and making changes that still means the system operates perfectly within the Linux ecosystem. There is nothing stopping changes from each project then being pulled into each other, as happens in many opens source projects.\n\nTo be against the word "teams" for open source is simply absurd. This is the very essence of open source. To take the code and run with it. The Linux kernel has subsumed code from literally hundreds of other projects developed by different teams over the course of its history.\n\nOne noticeable difference between Linux and Bitcoin, is that Linus, the creator of Linux, is the benevolent dictator. If Satoshi were leading the Bitcoin Core team, this would never have been an issue as he would have stuck to his vision of scaling on chain.': 1, 'He was speaking about Bitcoin.
