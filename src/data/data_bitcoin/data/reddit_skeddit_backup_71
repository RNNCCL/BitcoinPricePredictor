If the people paying that much really love using Bitcoin as compared to other means, they might be willing to pay 5%.  So the transaction value itself would $60 / .05 or $1200.  So this would be the minimum value, but let's go with all Tx being that size.  So then at double today's capacity, let's say 6000 Tx per 10 minutes.  Per day Tx value then is $1200 X 500,000 or $600M per day. In bearer asset cleared! Per day!  $219B per annum. In fricitonless person to person bearer assets cleared! Cleared in about 30 minutes!   If they are more realistically only paying 1% and the average is 3 X our minimum, it's $9B per day!!!  This can only happen with a $50,000 btc or like.\n\n\nThis is your idea of failure and the Zimbabwe dollar?\n\nDo I have to explain that bankers would be wetting themselves to create credit markets with infinite transaction capacity for that asset\n\n$60 Tx fees are a very high class problem.": 1, "Plain wrong - some raw capacity increase is essential in the near term - as long as usage continues to increase.\n\nSuggesting that a fee market can solve a raw capacity issue is misdirection.\n\nTake that 6c fee - you are right - who the hell cares about 6c?.  BUT, once the system is overloaded, the competition to get your Tx through, moves that upwards - exponentially.\n\n6c becomes 60c, then $6, then $60 - at that point you really start to lose users, and .... bang goodbye Bitcoin - from failure of confidence. Then people will really lose money. Think Zimbabwe dollar.\n\nSo a fee market sounds fine, but only if we also address the actual capacity crunch that is clearly imminent. Things like SegWit and Lightning are fine (though inherently complex and hard to test), BUT we will still need some extra raw capacity (block limit) in the near future.\n\n2Mb + Hardfork = bad?

It increases centralization by increasing node requirements.   Without nodes, the common user can't vote, even if they wanted to.  That's where this path leads.\n\n2.  Getting 2x capacity increase is desired by people bitching about 6 cent fees.  At the same time people are stuffing blog articles into the blockchain because it's cheap.  Obviously there isn't enough GOOD transactions to out price that bad behavior.  (yes higher fees)\n\n3.

Also the solution only has the greatest benefit with everyone utilizing it (the solution works best when everyone is using it)  I like and am for Core's roadmap because while it would be more difficult to implement...once its implemented it would be trivial to implement the blocksize changes that classic is attempting to do now.  \n\n\n\n---\nClassic is trying to implement technically easy solutions that would work right away but at the expense that it could cause problems for any users who do not upgrade to bitcoin classic if a hardfork is triggered .... the chance of this happening is appearing to shrink at the moment  (they need 75% threshold for a fork to activate and they had 3.6% - now its dropped to 2.7% - by 75% I mean they need to mine 750 of the last 1000 blocks using bitcoin classic - but only 5% of hashrate is mining using classic anyway)\n\n\n---\nFinally, I believe that the underlying issue here is that the vocal minority who is for classic (it's a growing minority imo I might add) is for classic for the wrong reasons - they say we need bigger blocks because bitcoin needs to scale!  (I think they think that if bitcoin can scale to a bigger size, that more people will be drawn to using it and that more companies would be willing to test applications using it - however just because there is capacity doesn't mean there's demand to use it).  Also, this argument has been going on more years - since at least 2011 on bitcointalk as I've heard it mentioned (but not followed).  Setting the Blocksize each time we hit the capacity limit sets a dangerous precedent - its a kick the can solution...why not solve the difficult problem first and implement both solutions at that point - should we hit a scenario where the transaction backlog fails to clear then at a certain point (whether it be a few days or weeks) if we're really truly running into problems to where the network is impacted then a crash landing happens, core would  bandaid the blocksize then....that time has not happened yet (it's coming sooner than later though)\n\nSorry for the Wall \n\nedit: some formatting...and well I wanted to address your comments....also I feel that a big elephant in the room is this:  We're all still one community...I know we will come back together with cohesion sooner than Mainstream media would incline you to believe....don't let this inner bickering fool you...I'd probably have the back of any given btc (and probably most buttcoin) subscribers irl because you're my people.": 4}, ('First Mac-targeting ransomware hits users, demands bitcoin', 62): {"This is the problem with **security by permission**.

In particular I think this point is not valid:\n\n> A hypothetical oppressive government which is powerful enough to actually cause confusion over the true value of a block hash from one year ago would also be powerful enough to overpower any proof of work algorithm\n\nWhat this overlooks is self-verifying property of proofs of work. A stag\'s antlers are objectively "this big", and can be verified as different from others based on this. Bitcoin block hashes have objectively "this much" work embedded (not just in their own hash, but back down the linked list). That "self-verifying" element is critical: it means I only need to see *one* copy of the true chain to be alerted that something is wrong (I still might be in trouble if swamped by Sybils, but I\'d at least have a chance). That\'s not true otherwise. Seeing one disagreeing hash from a node doesn\'t tell me much if it\'s not using PoW; it\'s probably just a miscreant. So other consensus mechanisms for the list of block hashes can\'t have that property, because nothing digital does: there are an infinite number of possible histories. Only a physical mechanism can have that property of being genuinely *difficult* to replicate. Proof of work *reifies* digital patterns.\n\nButerin, I think, in that article is trying to come up with a good *distributed* consensus, but that\'s never going to have the same dynamic properties as a self-verifying consensus from proof of work.\n\nSee e.g. this part: \n\n> "However, this logic ignores why consensus algorithms exist in the first place. Consensus is a social process.."\n\nThat\'s what Bitcoin (attempts to) change: yes, consensus is by definition social (a property of a group of parties), but the dynamics of consensus is radically different for things that can be *objectively verified*. It\'s much stickier.\n': 2, 'Looks like Bitcoin has already won guys. Lets pop some champagne and celebrate. \n\nBut to actually be serious for a minute, its completely possible that a more efficient consensus mechanism than PoW is discovered (e.g. someone pulls off a viable PoS implementation that has significant advantages) and that Bitcoin at that time is not able to implement said mechanism quickly enough (because of entrenched interests) until after the time which Bitcoin has given up its market share and has lost its first mover advantage. \n\n7 years of blockchain history and "price discovery" won\'t fix that. \n\nThe idea that "better shit can be added as its proven" is silly when your user base is a few million out of billions. People who know anything about the history of technologies, especially those experiencing network effects, have already seen this before. \n\nI don\'t say this because I think Bitcoin is going to lose.

However, I guess this also presents a unique case where a minority fork can survive with  an interesting advantage being that it won't have to rely on PoW to survive, meaning it can fork without any sort of hashrate battle. And since it probably won't die from being attacked due to Bitcoin's   reasonably widespread distribution(other than Satoshi), it's possible that that might motivate some people to hold rather than dump as a way to hedge their bets with both chains. \n\nI hadn't really thought about it too much, but unless I missed something there it's not as bad as I originally thought.

This wasn't an attack, but it proved an attack was possible (the attack could've affected more than just coinbase transactions).

There is still a very reduced reliance on trust in an environment like we have today where there are many nodes and trusting them is ok.  \n\nIn a world of very large blocks, very few parties would have the capacity to keep the blockchain and update it.  This then creates a need for trust.  It is not at all a stretch to imagine that a small handful of huge servers could be compelled by some authority to censor some signatures.  Bad guy keys signatures could be made illegal to mine and propagate to the network should they be mined.  It would be trivial to list and censor them.

So you can't tell if a block is valid without the signatures.\n\nOld nodes can't, correct. They are depending on updated nodes to validate blocks. Updated nodes continue validating all [pruned] signature data. Old nodes don't need to *so long as witness nodes are doing so.*\n\n> Core doesn't actually validate transactions before a certain date, because it doesn't add much practical security. So when you drop witness data, you remove a node's ability to check whether a transaction actually had permission to spend its inputs, which is definitely part of what it means for a tx to be valid.\n\nSure, in a philosophical sense. But not in regards to the protocol. The protocol just requires that a valid block conform to the signatures of the transactions contained within it. If not, the block is invalid. This is why we include both merkle roots in the coinbase transaction of the block, rather than requiring old nodes to validate every signature of every transaction. \n\n> Non-upgraded nodes don't have to drop off the network, but they can no longer validate transactions fully if they don't download the witness data (which can make blocks up to 4 MB each). They basically have a form of SPV security (it's stronger than pure SPV because they can still validate SOME transactions).\n\nYes, I acknowledge that they aren't fully validating. They are fully validating transactions within a block, but they make a security trade-off by trusting the network of witness nodes to validate the witness merkle tree.\n\nThis is much preferable to rendering them SPV nodes that only download block headers. The idea is: retain partially-validating nodes on the network, as a security measure against Sybils, allowing them to rely on the censorship resistance of the network. A strong network of nodes (old or new) neutralizes Sybils and prevents miner collusion... as such, there is a basis for assumption that they are not censored from other nodes which altogether do full validation. It's not ideal, but it seems to be the best compromise at present between increasing throughput and exacerbating declining node health. Such partially-validating nodes offer considerably more security to the network than SPV nodes (which offer nothing). \n\nThis is why those of us who are most concerned about node health feel that Segwit already makes a massive compromise with big blockers on a way to move forward. No matter what, increased throughput (all else equal) will reduce security. The question is, to what extent does it have to?\n\nI wish we had more numbers and theories to run a simulation regarding potential attack vectors that exploit the witness chain. TBH I have not seen much discussion of this.

I regard it as an exercise whose positive outcome was at minimum to identify the specific points of contention (identifying these is the key to moving forward together as a community). Personal comment: I had not felt such a wave of optimism in regards the scaling debate in a long time.\n\nThe imperative was to agree on a process that satisfies the following requirements:\n\n- Increase the throughput of the Bitcoin network by 2x-3x yearly for the next two years.\n\n- Reach some consensus and achieve some form of unity/truce before the halving.\n\nThe four items proposed were:\n\n- Clarify the language concerning the hard fork parameters. "Around 2MB and no more than 3MB" would be replaced by simply "2MB", as proposed by the Bitcoin Classic implementation.\n\n- Implement a "readiness signaling mechanism". Essentially, wallets would "signal" their capacity/readiness to handle a fork. This lays the foundation for a system in which users are able to voice their opinion on certain key issues. It\'s not voting, just a method to poll the wallets.\n\n- Modify the miner threshold from 75%, as proposed by classic, to 95%, as proposed by Core.\n\n- Move up the estimated activation date. Having readiness signaling showing a vast majority of wallets ready to upgrade would stomp out some of the risks associated to a quick hard fork.

After lunch, the CEO\'s of two prominent Bitcoin companies were invited to comment on this proposal and argued against it on the grounds that this was still "too vague" and that, regardless, the issue had more to do with the identity of the developers than the scaling process.\n\nI\'ll just say that according to an informal "show of hands", most of the Core roadmap / existing Hong Kong agreement proponents present at the meeting were in favor.

The conflict boils down to whether bitcoin's source code is in need of change.\n\nOver the last year, a number of eminent developers have issued warnings that bitcoin will hit the roof. Most notably Mike Hearn, a heavyweight in the business, as he departed from the community in January [pronouncing the currency dead](https://medium.com/@octskyward/the-resolution-of-the-bitcoin-experiment-dabb30201f7#.zaq9r698c).\n\nWhat is causing the issue? Simplified, it's about bitcoin's codebase being ill-equipped for the fast growth of the number of transactions.\n\nA bitcoin transaction is confirmed each time a miner unlocks a new block of coins. Each block contains roughly 1 MB. Critics have it that 1 MB is too little and that the block size needs to increase to 2 MB.\n\nThe issue can be compared to a over busy railroad, and therefore needs to go from a single track to double tracks.\n\nThe previous week has proven the critics right. The time for confirming a transaction has increased from 10 minutes to more than half an hour. Some web shops that previously accepted bitcoin [have ceased doing so](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/48g5a4/before_and_after_bitcoin_no_longer_accepted_at/).\n\nSo why doesn't the bitcoin community simply increase the block size to 2 MB? The answer is found in the infected conflict of two fractions \xe2\x80\x93 Classic and Core.\n\nCore, mostly represented by persons behind the original code, want to keep the 1 MB rule.\n\nOn the other side there's Classic, bringing forward their own, modified version of the code, containing an increase to 2 MB.\n\nBoth parties accuse the other side of performing overload attacks against the hostile codebase in order to convey the image that it is non-functional.\n\nSo far there is no peace on the horizon.

There are people who try to add little messages here and there, but it\'s not really a serious platform due to the limitation on space: you can\'t really hope to scale this message business up.\n\nHowever let\'s say that we allow the block size to be whatever the lowest minimum fee person will pay and it will always increases in size automatically to allow that? Well that opens the door to new businesses that start using the block at the lowest possible rates as a cloud storage system\n\nUh oh, you just introduced a new customer type into the system. Yeah, they are always going to be at the low end of the market, but "next block" space will pretty much always be limited no matter what the limit is at, so now we have two customers for that next block: currency people and space people. \n\nBefore we just had currency people, so we have increased demand for limited space, which means currency people might end up paying more than they were before. In other words the space customers might consume the entire low end of the market for fees, which means a currency customer would always have to pay a higher rate than the minimum, unlike now where they often do not.': 0, '1.

The fees are 6 cents now, but block size pressure is increasing which will continue the increase in fees. Bitcoin can\'t continue to grow when there are "not enough seats on the bus" for the new users.\n\n3. A hard fork showdown, as you call it, is not likely. What miner would continue to mine a coin only accepted by 25% of the network? Blocks on the 1mb side would take at least 40 minutes to find, causing more users to switch.\n\nA hard fork is only a problem if the losers fight it with mining power.

Some people call any use of the blockchain valid or any design that seeks to determine how it is used to be central planning, but most others would consider the non-zero cost that each transaction has on the system as a whole, and say that it should be discouraged for fear of interfering with the intended purpose of the system to serve as a currency and not a cloud storage mechanism': 2, '2mb is not going to buy us much time. larger blocksizes will certainly be detrimental to the network, while 2mb only _might_ be detrimental to the network. we will not be able to scale very much more by increasing it: so all we are doing is buying time.\n\nEventually, we want exponential scale. This is only possible with layer 2 solutions. so they will be needed with or without 2mb blocks. People claiming that the fact the core developers want to support layer 2 solutions is somehow evidence of an effort to sabotage the protocol are completely off base, and most likely attempting to spread FUD.\n\nSegwit, a core proposal, also buys time. almost as much, in fact, as 2mb blocks. In addition to allowing more tx rate, segwit also adds numerous other improvements to the protocol. improvements which will help with layer 2 solutions.\n\nThe future is obviously layer 2. the question is how do we get there? segwit or 2mb blocks?\n\nThe answer is already clear. It\'s segwit. 2mb is unsafe without it, so we probably wouldn\'t be very smart to deploy 2mb first. Segwit WILL be deployed first, whether or not 2mb blocks ever follow. The question is then: do we still need 2mb blocks _ever_? I contend: no. 2mb blocks aren\'t the future, theyre a band-aid to get to the future, only: we have a better band-aid. Segwit.\n\nIs there a case in which we need both segwit _and_ 2mb blocks? I contend this is unlikely. Even if you would rather fork the protocol than see average fees approach a dime rather than a nickel, we will probably have real scaling solutions by the time we need them. I estimate segwit buys between 1 and 2 years, even at a superlinear... an increasing growth rate. Blockchain spam like we saw last week is no justification for urgency. If anything, the spam proves blockspace is still too cheap.\n\nMy personal belief is that Bitcoin should be fork-resistant. This makes it a trustworthy crypto, and untrustworthy cryptos don\'t deserve economic investment. This resistance is worth far more to me than a miserable one-time tx bandwidth increase like we would get from 2mb blocks. I contend there are other networks which can share the load for low-value transactions if Bitcoin\'s fees ever get above a dime. LTC comes to mind: that\'s why it was invented. \n\nIn the end, I am one of those that feel the primary purpose of Bitcoin is to serve as the first digital state-free global reserve currency, like gold, and as such, no sacrifices should be made to bend the protocol to being a payment network. There are many suitable payment networks for low value transactions: including centralized and decentralized ones based on Bitcoin. \n\nForking the protocol because worst-case-in-near-future dime fees are too much, to buy only a little time until blocks are full again and we repeat this shit, after which point we will be unable to boost blocksize further, when we have a different solution which gets almost the same boost to buy time until when the next layer which is already showing promise in testing phase is ready more or less prove a fork to 2mb blocks is "about the worst idea ever" (TM) -- and there is a lot of competition for that title.\n\nThe idea is so bad-- and the foodfight in the community has been so bad that it leads otherwise level-headed people to suspect we are being manipulated by mal-actors who may actually be "out to get Bitcoin" ': 0, 'You might be right.

": 1, "Some people seem to assume that Core is fully in Blockstream's pocket, and that because Adam Back and a few core devs signed the agreement that means all of Core must inevitably fall in line behind them.": 1, "I believe some Core devs will code a 2MB hard fork after SegWit is deployed and present it to the community for evaluation in a few months. The question is whether or not SegWit will be delayed due to some people being unwilling to settle for what is actually the better and more necessary solution.\n\nI'm not sure that it's really about governance. As far as I can tell, certain devs feel slighted or marginalized by the rest of the dev community, and they wish to consolidate the protocol under their own control. I see it as good practice for the network to resist coercion from more powerful groups later on. We'll see just how anti-fragile Bitcoin is.": 4, "Sidechains have potential to be less-secure. You are right to note they will usually have their own mining infrastructures which will likely be smaller than Bitcoin proper. Hopefully, they come up with innovative POW or POS models to maximize security. I don't doubt we will see a balance between security and the intended use case of the sidechain.\n\nCentralization pressure will depend entirely on the specifics of the sidechain. \n\nSidechains, like Bitcoin in general, will be completlet optional-- though many users will want to use them for the utility they provide.": 1, 'but it is the number of "experts" that matter. the others are just part of the same "hive mind" spreading "FUD"': 0, "It comes down to what Bitcoin's purpose really is.  \n\nPayPal, banks and credit cards already are very convenient.

If a mildly interested party can't load up the blockchain and verify for themselves, Bitcoin is not money.

I personally in vision LN becoming the standard for point of sale systems, but we shouldn't hope to move a majority of our commerce to LN.  There has been a lot of discussion of if LN is decentralized or not. Some argue that LN is decentralized since anyone can operate LN hub. Will I be able to operate a LN hub from my home Internet? (Since that is the standard they are using for nodes, it's a fair comparison.) Personally i think that detail isn't quite so important.
