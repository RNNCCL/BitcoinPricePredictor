If you are prepared to mine when the price rockets on speculation, and before the difficulty adjusts to compensate, there are significant profits to be made.\n\nBut I reject that argument. Mining would still be profitable under a continually adjusting difficulty. If it wasn't, miners would stop hashing, and the difficulty would drop until it became profitable again. Maybe there would be less easy profits mining because you wouldn't have these vast stretches (relatively speaking) where new more efficient/profitable mining hardware has been added to the network and the difficulty takes two weeks to catch up.

However it seems to be soundly rejected by most users, and I wouldn't be surprised if the majority of nodes (and even miners) end up rejecting RBF transactions.  \n\nAlso, keep in mind that the playing field has changed a LOT in the past few months.  In September there was Core and XT and that's it.  Now there's BU and Classic and I'm sure there will be others.  So you can consider it a ray of light that the Bitcoin ecosystem as a whole is starting to embrace the idea of multiple implementations.
