But accomodating more users and all their garbage transactions requires increasing the block size. The effect of an increase to 8 MB will not be immediate; it will only allow the traffic to creep up from the current ~120\'000 tx/day to ~3 million tx/day, instead hiting a limit at ~360\'000 tx/day. The nodes will continue to become more expensive to run, as they are now, but the cost will continue to rise slowly without limit instead of stopping when it is 3x as expensive as today.\n\n>The Blockstream guys, on the other hand, have decided that traffic on the bitcoin network cannot be allowed to grow much further. So they have decided that the current and future "normal" users of bitcoin should be forced to relocate to some rubegoldbergian "overlay network" that, by coincidence, will be using software components to be developed by Blockstream. Their plan to achive this goalis to keep the blocks at 1 MB and hope that, when the network staurates, the fees will rise until the "plebs" will no longer be able to afford them. One of their devs expects that the fees will end up being 3--6 BTC/block, which at current prices is 0.30-0.60 USD/tx. The bitcoin network then will be reserved to a small and non-growing set of elite users, including the hubs of the overlay network.\n\n>**It is ironic that Blockstream accuses Gavin and Mike of "dictatorial", since I have not seen any discussion of their own Master Plan for evicting the current bitcoin users and pushing them to the overlay network.** I also doubt very much that they understand what they are doing. They don\'t seem aware of chaos that the "fee market" will be, whether for plebs or for the gents of means.
