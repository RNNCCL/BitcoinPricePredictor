This is where bitcoin gets into a terrible catch 22. \n\nAlternate currencies are accepted (on mass) only at locations where significant consumer demand is present for the alts. tourist destinations are a good example. That means consumers spending the bitcoin.  But if consumers intend to spend the bitcoin... Why bother going through the hassle and cost of converting fiat to bitcoin just to spend it? The only reason to go through that headache is to buy and hold for appreciation.  To add insult to injury they just lost the points they would have got if they would have used their CC.\n\nI agree that quick growth, volatility and FOMO are now the primary reasons people get involved in bitcoin.

I've been using almost the exact same wording for years now:  the magic does not happen until bitcoin is money (or to the extent that it has become money. . . which it has to some extent or within certain limited spheres).\n\nThe classic buttcoiner exists precisely because they feed their incredulity of the grandiose things bitcoin is supposed to be able to accomplish, with a shallow view of bitcoin, based only upon what it is now (or simply a scaled version of what it is now).  The promise of bitcoin was never about being a payment network, a decentralized paypal, a way to stick it to bank fees.  This was always about what happens if and when bitcoin becomes money; the most saleable commodity.  When it is the unit of account.  Scaling the number of transactions per second that the network can handle/confirm is certainly going to be important moving forward. . . but this utility as a payment network is only secondary to the utility of a whole new monetary system which references the bitcoin unit.\n\nI don't necessarily agree with the author that pegging and other technological solutions are going to be the primary means of getting from here to there.  But those will be part of it.  The continuing and most important entrepreneurial and speculative action right now is simply this:\n\nBuy and hold.\n\nSpending is not bad. . . but that spending needs to be organic and based upon real demand for bitcoin by the business accepting it.  While most firms are not in the business of being currency speculators on top of their normal operations; at a certain level of growth and decline of their currently accepted money. . . they will begin to demand bitcoins in their own right, the same way that they demand dollars or euros or yen now.

Bitcoin as money is one of those.\n\nBut hey, enjoy your slightly easier customer experience at Starbucks and don\'t bother thinking of a world which could be radically different in positive ways, from the one in which we now live.

Debt. And the mistaken hope that mounds of *new* debt will miraculously pull a rabbit out of a hat in the form of new growth, indefinitely. Its a radical, and unproven Keynesian pipe dream.

That is a ledger of an entirely new kind, one that does not revolve around trust, governments, mankind\'s prejudices (politics) and so on. It is backed by the purest, most unbiased and valid form of validation we know; mathematics.\n\nTo say that currency "must represent the value of society, economy and humanity" is fundamentally incorrect. It most certainly does not.

You can reuse the same address without concern. And with Monero, for example, you can use a viewkey to unhide transactions at will.  Lack of GUI and pruning issues aside, it seems not a bad approach at all.\n\nWith CJ you have to go through the somewhat tense rigamarole of mixing and then you are also careful to never reuse addresses. At that point, with a fair amount of effort,  you have some level of  plausible deniability relative to the number of CJ iterations you\'ve paid for.  CT adds to that but it\'s still all there in public view and a determined enough entity could make connections, even without amounts.  Altogether, not easy and not even that private.\n\nZerocash sounds great on paper doesn\'t offer much [anything? pruning?] compelling beyond cryptonote in terms of privacy.  It also has that trapdoor issue at its inception [trust that the person destroys the key] and sails on relatively uncharted cryptographic waters.  At this point it is more of an academic science project than an ironclad privacy solution, and the guy who spearheaded it to begin with doesn\'t even appear to understand bitcoin.': 2, '/u/BassheadPanda, NimbleBodhi wants to send you a tip for 5000 bits ($1.28).

Regardless of the future, Monero delivers privacy and fungibility - effortlessly - today.  For cash to be cash, and freedom to be freedom, these are two critical properties.\n\nOn the other hand, Bitcoin is quite assuredly broken by default and requires iron determination and discipline to approach any level of privacy.  And even when you do everything right, people who send you Bitcoin probably don't, thereby creating breadcrumbs or arrows in your general direction.  And just wait until blockchain analysis matures....\n\n> Not reusing addresses is automated by HD wallets these days, like breadwallet, so I wouldn't say it's difficult. \n\nEven if your wallet automatically creates a new receiving address for each transaction, they are automatically and irritatingly linked whenever you send any amount large enough to draw from more than one of them, no?\n\n> Their next step is to integrate with wallets, so as to make using JM extremely simple.\n\nWould be great, but it should really be automatic, without requiring the user to even blink.  Even if they integrate with wallets, you'll still have to take an action and evaluate how much privacy you want to pay for every time you mix.  I predict most people are not going to bother.  And those that do will stand out.\n\n> And don't forget, both JM's CJ and CT are fully compatible with pruning.\n\nTrue enough.\n\n> I believe this issue has been resolved, though I don't remember the link to more info on it.\n\nI think I heard the same thing, but then found it was not that great of a solution.  Like it was a still a thing with video, but there were multiple people involved instead of just one.  Not sure.\n\n> I wouldn't judge ZC based on comments by one individual. There are a lot of people involved in creating ZC.\n\nFair enough, but it also seems like something that is perhaps too hot for academia to handle.  As Zerocoin gains attention, are the universities involved going to fight for cypherpunk ideals or cave to BS about ZC enabling opaque drug use, child porn or assassination markets etc.  And even once the coin's implementation is solid enough to float, assuming it gets there, you're talking about weathering the same political BS storm throughout the regulator-friendly contingent of the Bitcoin community.  It could be a long and winding road.  Monero does everything except prune [and multisig]....today.\n\n> ZC is fully zero knowledge, while Cryptonote is not zero knowledge (transaction amounts are visible). This makes ZC a lot better.\n\nI've heard that ZC might be so opaque that it would be difficult to tell if something went wrong, but that could be FUD.  Monero might have visible amounts - in the sense that there are amounts in the blockchain, but any transaction amount is broken up into a bunch of random parts, each part made into its power of ten, and then mixed amongst a set of previous transactions in the blockchain bearing the same amounts.  Without a viewkey, there's no indication of what got sent to whom, just a bunch of homogenized transaction amounts being sent to seemingly random, unlinked addresses.\n\nThis is a good presentation if you haven't seen it:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEVm1dMn5Ks\noutgoing transactions 15:41, incoming transactions 20:00  \n\nJust finished the link you sent.  Looks promising as ever but at the end I get a sense of regulatory friendliness that might lead to things being compromised or watered down.  I do realize that Monero's Viewkey could be considered a concession in that regard but at least the implementation is sound - the power lies with the user, where it should be.\n\nIf I appear cynical regarding bitcoin, it's probably due to the recent blocksize turmoil.  The community I had thought of as mostly reasonable individuals turned into a hooting mob of orangutans unable to see long run consequences.  I'm no longer as optimistic about taking a popular concensus protocol and fixing it so everyone's happy.  Maybe better to get some fundamental elements right from the beginning.

Additionally, this would all be outlined in similar form on the required IRS 990 Form. I don't have exact financial statements in front of me now, but here are some basic points to consider: a. $4.6m based on March 2nd, 2014 valuation ~$673/BTC because books completed up until that time (of course, if you go back to December 2013, the BTC price was even higher); b. average Bitcoin Foundation expenses for 2014 of approximately $150k per month; c. ~90% of assets maintained in BTC as determined by board of directors; d. Foundation raised in nominal terms approx. $500-650k in membership dues and donations during its existence (price appreciation got us to where we were at the time); e. January 1, 2015 exchange rate ~$264/BTC Since my last day on the board of the foundation was December 31st, 2014, that is where my confidential access would terminate. How were the funds allocated is your question, so please allow me to explain (rough ball-park approximation for your benefit because the dates are not exact): $4.6m (BTC asset valuation on March 2, 2014) -$1.5m (10-month foundation burn rate at avg $150k/mo) -$2.5m (approx. foreign exchange loss from BTC assets during period) =$0.6m (balance remaining at Bitcoin Foundation on January 1, 2015) \n\nWhich led to this [article](https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/bitcoin-foundation-blew-5800-btc-10-months/)\n\nBasically the dude partied with other peoples' money for 10 months and bailed.

So when you sell both for $500, you made $300 gains.\n\nS4: You earned normal income of the fair value of your work, or the daily average price of 1 BTC. This will have income tax. When you sell, the price of the watch less the above is your capital gain.\n\nS5: Back in the day, those coins had zero value. The capital gain is whatever he sold them for. Fortunately it's been long enough that it will be long-term gains, with a reduced tax rate.\n\nYou can use https://bitcoin.tax to help you work it all out.\n": 1, 'In Scenario 1, you can use any one of three allowed accounting methods for calculating your capital gain/loss:\n\n* **First-In, First-Out:** You always sell your oldest bitcoins first. This will cause you to pay the most tax if your oldest bitcoins are also your cheapest bitcoins. Conversely, if you initially bought in when the Bitcoin price was at its peak, then this method will generate the greatest capital loss for you. (Note that there is a limit to the amount of capital loss you can claim in one year, but you can roll forward the remainder to subsequent years.) In your example, you would have sold 0.75 BTC of the 1 BTC you bought at $500. Your cost basis for that 0.75 BTC was $375, so selling it for $300 generated a $75 capital loss.\n\n* **Average Cost Basis:** You always sell bitcoins from all of your lots, in proportion to the sizes of the lots. In your example, since you had acquired 3 BTC and then sold 0.75 BTC, you sold 25% of your total stake, so you sold 25% of the 1 BTC you bought at $500, 25% of the 1 BTC you bought at $200, and 25% of the 1 BTC you bought at $600. Your cost basis is 0.25*($500+$200+$600)=$325, so your sale generated a $25 capital loss. Note that you now have only 0.75 BTC remaining in each of your three lots.\n\n* **Specific Identification:** You have to specify which lot(s) you sold. This method gives you the most flexibility in how you generate capital gain/loss. In your example, you might want to specify that you sold the 0.75 BTC from the 1 BTC that you had purchased at $600. Your cost basis for the 0.75 BTC would be $450, so selling it for $300 would generate a capital loss of $150.': 2, 'libratax.com\n\nbitcoin.tax': 1, 'Scenario 1. If using First in First out method. Well. it\'d be 0.75*500=Cost Basis.  Sold price=300. Sold price -Cost Basis =Capital Gain or loss. And you\'d still have .25 BTC at 500 remaining for your next transaction. \n\nYou essentially have to keep two tables, one showing your transactions and another table that rolls through your balances and dates of acquisition when you encounter a taxable event and that tracks "standing" balances and reports your Cost Basis for the current transaction. \n\nI made my own personal "website" here on my intranet to do it for me. I have to enter and classify every single transaction as like (purchase new btc with fiat, sold btc for fiat, personal expense, business expense, exchange btc for other crypto, received btc from sell of other crypto, etc...). But it\'s not so bad now as I\'m up to date. \n\nScenario 2: I use my website I made to do that, it\'s essentially the same as example one. \n\nScenario 3: You valued your basedball cards at 200 as extrapolated from the btc price. So your cost basis would be 200. You sold for 500. So you had a capital gain of 300 dollars, if the time between buying the btc and selling was over a year you pay long term capital gains, if it was under you pay short term capital gains. \n\nScenario 4: You were paid whatever the value in dollars for 1 BTC was on the date of the transaction as "Normal Income".  When you buy the watch for 1BTC the value of the watch would be your cash out value. So fill in the blanks. Sold-Cost=Capital gain or loss. Then if the duration was over a year you pay long term capital gains, if under you pay short term capital gain. \n\nThe 1 million btc would have a cost basis based on the going rate on the date you mined them and that should have been reported as "normal" income during the appropriate tax year. So, if you sold all million in one go, you\'d take the amount of the proceeds as sold value. and subtract your cost basis which in satoshis case would be a huge profit with long term capital gains owed on the difference.
