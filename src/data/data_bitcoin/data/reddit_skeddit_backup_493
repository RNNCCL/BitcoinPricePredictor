What you're seeing is, in part, the hangover from one hell of a party.": 2, "New users are only buying tiny amounts of bitcoin so far because the technology is still very new and risky in their minds. There is approximately $1million worth of btc being mined everyday, and much of that needs to be sold to keep the mining operations afloat. Also, most merchants don't keep all of their btc from sales but convert them back to dollars.\n\nFor the price to go up, bitcoin needs more HODLers and more large buy orders.": 2, 'Do not make the same mistake people make with regards to stocks. They assume good news means the price will go up, and bad news the price will go down.\n\nFree markets are complex systems, and unless the news is  a complete surprise (i.e. meteor hitting earth), most events are already priced in way in advance.   Particularly in an unregulated market like bitcoin.\n\n': 1, 'Actual use of bitcoins for e-payments has a very small effect on price, which is mainly determined by speculation: people buy it now for 230 $ because they expect to be able to sell it to someone else for more than that, whether minutes or decades in the future.  \n\nIt there was no speculation, and bitcoins were used only for e-payments, the price would probably be less than 10 $/BTC. \n\nUnfortunately, there is nothing to anchor the future price expectations on.  There is no solid argument that will justify why the price cannot be 0.05 $/BTC or 500\'000 $/BTC next year.  Even the most respected bitcoin gurus have been incredibly wrong when they tried to predict the price 6 months in advance.  Therefore, the price is at the mercy of mood swings by the speculators (especially the Chinese day-traders, who apparently have been setting the price since they "discovered" bitcoin in 2013).  When the day-traders feel a bit more pessimistic about the future price, they sell, the price drops, and that makes other day-traders more pessimistic too.  The opposite happens whe the price rises.  Presumably, the price stops falling or rising because the expectations of some cool-headed traders are not so easily swayed by price changes, so they start buying when the others want to sell, and vice-versa.\n\nMoreover, while many new retailers are starting to accepting bitcoins every month, there is no data showing that the volume of e-payments is increasing.  Instead, there are isolated hints that it is decreasing.    Basically, paying with bitcoin is an interesting alternative only to those who already have bitcoins and want to sell some of them.\n\nSo the increasing number of merchants has to divide a small and probably shrinking stream of bitcoin revenue.  Several merchants and businesses have revealed that sales via bitcoin are negligible, and some have even noticed that offering bitcoin as a payment option actually reduces their revenue, by turning some of their non-bitcoiner customers away.  ': 1, "Bitcoin's USD value is one small measure of Bitcoin value, but not really that significant. The total Bitcoin pool is less than $4 billion worldwide. A drop in price shows more people selling Bitcoin than buying, but that also shows more merchants accepting it worldwide, then selling it at the end of the business day. The more it is sold off into fiat currency by businesses to pay staff, operation costs, etc, the more this may affect the overall price. And miners have to sell Bitcoin for fiat currency to pay their bills too.\n\nThe peak price was an obvious bubble from China's run on Bitcoin and Mt. Gox/Willy-Bot manipulation of market rates. You know this because once the market corrected itself, the price moved back to the trajectory it had before the bubble. Still about double the original price a year later than the price before the bubble.\n\nYou can say that the price drop is a good thing, in some regards. It shows merchants are accepting it more and more, and it's relatively low price makes getting into Bitcoin fairly inexpensive. If Bitcoin USD were $2-3k, that would do more hard than good. People would think it was a bubble, and/or too expensive/too late to get in on.\n\nLook at the bright side. You can buy more Bitcoin, and you'll be that much farther ahead down the line.

The issue I have with sidechains is how they are secured.  \n\nNon-merge mined sidechains require their own consensus system, which almost always is based on proof of work or a proof of work/stake hybrid as no strictly proof of stake consensus systems have survived so far to my knowledge.\n\nThis means non-merge mined sidechain will require its own mining infrastructure that is likely to be incompatible with bitcoin\'s, and will, if it were to become popular, drain demand from hardware used to mine bitcoin, reduce the hash power of the network, and drop the price.  Some might see this as a "safety valve" effect, but people with a vested interest in bitcoin\'s price will see this as parasitic.  Bluntly, no miner or holder of bitcoin will support any non-merge mined sidechain scheme knowing that it stands to suck the life out of bitcoin and tank the price.  The problem?  These people need to agree to non-merge mined sidechains to make them possible.  So unless the cost is worth the price to those with a vested interest in bitcoin\'s success, I see non-merge mined sidechains as a non-starter.\n\nMerge mined sidechains are also problematic.

[This is not unprecedented; see coiledcoin.](http://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/3472/what-is-the-story-behind-the-attack-on-coiledcoin)   Furthermore, merge mining still contributes to the centralization of mining because in order to be competitive with other miners, you must be able to merge mine for the biggest ROI, and setting up your rig to merge mine many side chains requires far more setup and maintenance.\n\nI\'m happy to support sidechains, but I have yet to see an implementation of the idea that isn\'t either harmful to bitcoin or in some way critically flawed.

Why set a hard limit on a open market concept? Blocks size should be virtually unlimited.

How is that not a market already today? Pay more than the going rate to confirm timely transaction pickup.\n\nFurthermore it sounds like your statement claims that hotels cannot even price their rooms unless they are constantly full and some vacationers are constantly unable to sleep in a town.

Bitcoin is also intentionally designed such that the cost of accepting transactions is as close to zero as practical.": 6, "> Also note that not only miners should be able to run a node.\n\nFull disclosure: My network connection is more than dialup, so my node will continue running. I've got *runs a speed test* 30mbps at my house connected to a rural wisp and 1gbps (no data transfer fees) on my $6/mo VPS.\n\nI'm really not sure how to put this, but if node distribution got terrible I am pretty sure I could sell subscriptions to SPV off of a node that I run that would cost orders of magnitude less than trying to outbid your way into every successive, overfull 1MB block.\n\n> Miners can drop less-profitable transactions for more-profitable ones at any time, so there is no exclusivity issue to deter accepting the lower fees.\n\nExclusivity is virtually never an issue in the Hotel industry either. They advertise a *fixed* room rate, so they are never worried about a building being full and then some prince from Nigeria shows up volunteering 10x the going rate or anything like that. In fact, customers never volunteer anything: they are told a rate and take it or leave it (or maybe try to haggle or use a service with group discounts or whatever).\n\nInstead \xe2\x80\x94 save for perhaps the busiest seasons when your daily rates cannot keep enough people away \xe2\x80\x94 the hotels *actively set prices which prevent their buildings from being full*. As a result, *if* their building gets full then revenue greatly exceeds cost, while if they accept the predicted amount of business due to their pricing and marketing then they stay afloat with normally underfilled buildings.\n\nBut you will *never* see a hotel offering $0.01 cent rooms just because they want to steal business from the $0.02 cent competitor down the street. Game theory never takes them there.\n\n": 4, "While I haven't agreed with everything you have said or done in the past, I agree with everything you said in this post.\n\n1 book /u/changetip": 1, "> My point is that mining profitability is overwhelmingly dominated by other factors: Hardware cost, electricity cost, bitcoin price and difficulty. Hardware and electricity determine how competitive you are compared to other miners. Bitcoin price and difficulty determine whether everyone profits or everyone loses. The bitcoin price is outside of miners' control and it's extremely volatile, so small predictable expenses like running a node get drowned out in the noise.\n\nYour point seems to be lost since you don't realize mining happens for more than one day and the profit margins should be considered over a timespan and not over a single day.\n\n>If you're so worried about centralization, run your own damn node.\n\nOkay, I can see where you're coming from now.

Until blocks are consistently full, we do not have a transaction fee market.\n\nThat being said, I'm not decidedly opposed to lifting the hard limit - we could still do that and trust miners not to make bigger blocks outside of an emergency or future decision. On the other hand, mining is becoming dangerously centralised, and this makes it even more dangerous.": 70, '> Why do you assume it\'s acceptable to force people to settle for trusting your node with SPV\'s reduced security?\n\nWell that\'s only a "zomg nobody else can afford better than dialup in 2020" worst case scenario, and still tons better than "everybody gets to run a node but since literally none of them can afford to reliably post a transaction across it, no dial-up users would ever have a reason to".\n\n> The fixed room rate is because of exclusivity. If the rate was lower, they would fill up, and lose out because they couldn\'t sell any more rooms.\n\nHave you ever tried to book a hotel at 2am with 50% empty rooms and haggle a price? It is far too late at night for that many people to suddenly come through and try to pay full price, but the hotel *still* will not budge.\n\nHell, your claims of motivation would have that hotel let you stay in the room for a penny (or perhaps 1 penny more than cleaning costs) only because they know "full" ain\'t ever happening tonight even if they do let you in and because $0.01 > $0.00.\n\nBut no hotel I have *ever* heard of would do this, and this consciously turning away revenue *even when it is obvious* will not be directly replaced is *precisely* like setting a minimum-allowed tx fee at a mining pool and sticking to those guns even when the blocks are not full.\n\nWhy? Because caving in to lower prices *devalues your product*. Why would any half-way rational miner devalue their own product? Why would you fill any block with less than what you need to run your gear (in comparison to half-filling it with 25% less still) if that last dash for table scraps also serves to train the public that you will offer them fast confirmation times at tx rates that cannot reasonably support you?\n\nOn the other hand, when you actually *set* a minimum rate then any tx fees which short it run the risk of you finding the next block and they having to wait an extra step to get confirmed. Your pool is probably a small chunk of the world, but it\'s non-zero. Also, *most* pools will act rationally (like hotels, choosing not to devalue their product), which means setting and standing by (and quite probably advertising) their own minimum tx rates which creates a cloud of prices advertised representing a gradient to consumers how much it costs to have their tx confirmed approximately how fast.\n\n---\nIn comparison, "bidding for addition into tiny blocks" provides no market at all because you cannot predict how many other txns with what fees are going to try getting into the same block. Even financing 10x the miner\'s cost to mint a block cannot guarantee your transaction gets in because it is musical chairs. Every full block guarantees that *some transactions have to miss the bus* and that some commerce *has to be delayed*, potentially forever (or until the 24 hour mempool limit expires) and in an *absolutely* unpredictable and capricious manner.\n\nFire your txn now, and watch a ten thousand more poor in over the next minute in a spike of activity each with higher fees than you, taking hours to sift through the dialup-bottlenecked network.

For one it makes it harder for anyone to know how much you have gotten or how much you own.\n\nA wallet contains multiple addresses (or private keys to be exact).\nYour balance in the wallet is the total of all your generated addresses.': 4, '> A wallet contains multiple addresses (or private keys to be exact)\n\nAn HD wallet (the new standard found in apps) contains multiple addresses. A paper wallet (the classic approach to generating an address at bitaddress.org) contains just one.': 4, "> every time a new address is made isn't your wallet balance lost?\n\nNo, when you use an HD wallet, all of the private keys are cryptographically related to each other and are tied together by a list of random words stored in a specific order. A modern wallet app knows all addresses you've used previously and will use in the future. When you send a balance to another address, you actually send the entire amount contained in one or more unspent outputs -- enough to cover the transaction -- and specify where the excess balance beyond the amount you intended to send will be sent. This second address is called the Change Address. When you use a paper wallet with an app that is properly equipped to spend from a paper wallet (like Mycelium for Android), the app will specify your paper wallet's deposit address as the Change Address, returning any unused balance back to your paper wallet.\n\nIn a traditional payment scenario, your app will configure the transaction to send the balance you wish to send to the destination address and the app will specify your next deposit address in line as the change address. Since the app knows all of the addresses that are cryptographically related to your HD wallet, the app will always show the correct balance, no matter where in the sequence of millions of addresses your balance currently sits. If someone you've sent BTC to tries to go back and figure out how much BTC you own, they will only know the address from which you sent them their BTC (which now has a balance of zero) and that address will only show two transactions: the first transaction that loaded it either as a Change Address or as an amount you received from someone else and the second transaction when you sent them money and any leftovers to a change address.\n\ntl;dr Each time you send BTC, you send the balance where you wanted to send it and the remainder of your balance will end up in the next address you were scheduled to use -- unless you're (properly) using a paper wallet in which case the excess balance is returned to the paper.": 2, "You don't need to make a new address for receiving at all, it's perfectly safe to reuse an address many times to receive payments on.\n\nThere are two reasons it's suggested to use a new address each time you receive bitcoin though...\n\n1) Because you can easily identify who sent you the funds since you gave each person a unique address.  For merchants this is more important than for personal use since personal use you don't really care about specific invoices being paid or not and probably have a good idea of why someone's giving you money at a given point of time.\n\n\n2) When you transfer funds from an address you expose your public key, whilst currently this is still secure should quantum computers come to exist there is a 'potential' security risk in that someone may be able to derive your private key from this information.  Currently this task is still well beyond the realm of anyone in the public and probably beyond the realm of quantum computers as I'm sure we'd have heard about a heist or two by now!  The main reason people suggest it is paranoia, if you use a new address each time this sort of future potential attack vector isn't even possible to consider.\n\n\nYou wallet sums up all values stored in all addresses you've used.  Something like bitcoind creates a batch of something like 100 addresses to use in future, so when you back up your wallet it backs up all your used addresses AND the 100 unused addresses to be used in future.  This is why you should back up your bitcoind wallet.dat file regularly if you make lots of transactions, if you restore from a wallet 102 transactions ago you'll lose access to that last 2 transactions.\nTo avoid this issue many wallets have now moved to HD (hierarchical deterministic) wallets.  The main difference here is that the private key (i.e. that large random number) is derived from a single seed (Your public key number is derived from your private key and your address string is derived from that public key number).  This means if you know that seed number you can derive every private key, hence ever address you'll ever use on that wallet so the seed number is the only thing that needs backing up.\n\n": 3}, ('huge difference in testnet blockchain! 333K on @blockr_io @blockchains seems to be the right one, but @blocktrail 336K is the longer chain!', 9): {'Cool.
