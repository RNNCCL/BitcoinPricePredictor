After a discussion, particularly a heated one, it's not unusual for people at the meeting to come away with slightly different understandings of what people's positions were.\n\nI'm sure this is *exactly* why so many people in real organisations are opposed to full transparency - it's because trolls will analyse every word that was said.  Transparency turns board meetings into the equivalent of bitcointalk or this sub.  You can't just say what you think because if you express the half-formed idea as it comes into your head, then you know you'll be torn to pieces by Internet trolls as soon as the minutes are published.

Customer B has $1k in their account half of the time and the other half it is far less.

Customer B is likely to not be intelligent enough to understand when they are getting scammed and overcharged financially, or they are intelligent enough but are too depressed, on drugs, or lack the self-esteem to demand fair treatment. \n\nThere are a million ways that a bank can cancel an account, such as changing the date on your payment plan by one day without properly informing you about it, raising the rates on your loan, lowering the interest rate on your savings account so you miss an automatic payment by just a few dollars, or accuse you of \'suspicious activity\' for absolutely no reason at all.

I now see why you\'re asking what you\'re asking, and it\'s a good question.\n\nBasically, the blocks in Bitcoin take 10 minutes on average to mine (if they\'re being mined faster than this, then the network will increase the difficulty to slow them down; if they\'re being mined slower than this, it will decrease the difficulty so that they\'re easier to find, and are mined quicker). \n\nIf the block-time were set to a smaller average, like 5 minutes or 1 minute, then less Proof-of-Work would be needed to mine each block (by definition).

When the hashing problem takes ten minutes per block, this represents a much higher level of "work" required per block, meaning that much more CPU resources must be dedicated to the task, meaning that any transactions included in a block are reasonably secure, because such a huge expenditure would be required to execute a double-spend.

There are wallets like blockchain.info or Mycelium that listen to other nodes at several points of the network and tell you the propagation rate. When the propagation rate is 99% a double spend is very very improbable already unless the buyer controls a significant amount of hash power himself.\n\nA lot of devs would probably argue against this point but if you accept payments in a brick and mortar store I would't be worried at all. I think for a decent attempt to fool you an actual node connected to lot's of other nodes is musch better then a mobile wallet.\n\nIf you use a payment provider like BitPay or Coinbase there is nothing to worry about as they guarantee you your money as soon as the page shows that the payment is confirmed. AFAIK BitPay one stated that they never had a single problem with this strategy. They also have a strategy to check network propagation of the transaction and probably some other parameters like if there is a little fee in the transaction.\n\nFor 100$ the problem is about as theoretical as for 5.\n\nNow lets try to calculate a little example how much it would cost you to bribe a miner who has 25% of the hash power to help you do a 1 confirmation double spend. There is a lot of game theory involved and I might not be thinking about all parameters, but let's try:\n\nSo first we need the probability that the miner can present a longer chain after the transaction has 1 confirmation. So the miner needs to mine 2 blocks in the time the network mines one. These too blocks should then not include the initial transaction where the one block mined by someone in the 75% of the network does include it.\n\nSo the probability of the miner finding the initial, block at the same time (transaction not included and he of course withholds that block and keeps it to publish it later when he found the second) as the network is ~~25~~33%. Now he needs to mine the next block on top of his faster than the network mines another one on top of the block which includes the transaction. Lets keep it simple here and say the probability is 0.5 times 33% (50percent change the event will happen before)~~also 25%~~. So his chance is somewhere around 6.75%. In this case he gets two block rewards plus your bribe. In the other cases he looses his potential to have roughly mined halve a block so 12.5 BTC. So for your bribe you want to purchase Mining power worth 12.5 BTC for a ~~6.75~~ 5.5% chance of success to double spend a one confirmation transaction. So for you to make it worth to bribe him, the transaction has to be something like ~~185~~ 212 BTC just for a break even. Of course you risk to piss of a lot of people and is is still gambling.\n\nHowever there are some transaction amounts which are that large that from that stand point should never be made in the bitcoin network or let's say you would have to wait for many many confirmations. Also if you assume someone has access to miners wit more than 50% of the hash rate ~~(not another 100% on top of the current hashrate which you would need for a true 51% attack)~~ the success probability becomes much higher. So if you assume your customer has access to many miners or pools there are certain amounts you should not accept at all over the Bitcoin payment network.\n\n~~On mobile right now. I might edit this post later on PC to make it more clearmand remove typos. I will inform you if I do so.~~\n\nEdit: I think I was off by a factor 2 so the break even would be at 370 BTC, but I will give this some more thought and correct the post later when I have a decent keyboard and spreadsheet.\n\nEdit2: Some typos and numbers corrected.": 1, "A double spend is two transactions, A and B, that spend the same coin.\n\nThere are two somewhat practical ways to try doing it:\n\n1. A Race Attack sends A and B to different nodes simultaneously. Each node accepts the transaction because it doesn't see the counterpart. Clients with different memory pool policies will be vulnerable to this attack. For example: http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/239bj1/doublespending_unconfirmed_transactions_is_a_lot/\n2. A Finney Attack sends A to the network, but only after secretly mining B into a block. A goes into the memory pool, tricking the merchant into releasing the goods. The block containing B is then released, invalidating A. Much less practical due to the need to be able to mine a block competitively. http://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/4942/what-is-a-finney-attack\n\nA third method, Majority Hash Rate Attack, is only practical for those with access to massive amounts of hashing power. In other words, it isn't practical for very many people. Attacker gets A confirmed. Then, using majority status, mines a chain of blocks long enough to overtake the block with A. Adding a new block with B invalidates A, completing the double spend.\n\nThis attack works with 100% success given >50% of the network hash rate, but with less chance of success given <50% of the network hash rate.\n\nhttps://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Majority_attack\n\n": 1, 'The double spending problem is a classic problem that had plagued digital cash until Satoshi solved it with his proof-of-work blockchain.\n\nBasically, it\'s impossible to guarantee that everyone sees everything happen in the same order.  Imagine if you broadcast two transactions spending the same coins.  One tx is broadcast in Europe, and the other in Asia.  Now the nodes in Europe accept the first transaction, and reject the asian one as a double spend.  The nodes in asia do the opposite because they saw them in the other order (due to network latency).  The result is that you have a consensus split, and no incentive for nodes to come to agreement (who\'s going to concede and say "sure, take the money, I\'ll forfeit my payment"?).\n\nOn top of this, you also have the issue of network outages, out-of-order packets, and nodes coming and going from the network who need to find out what happened while they were gone, without having to take someones word for it (ie. trustlessly).\n\nThe blockchain solves this by saying that we accept the longest chain as the true history (and order) of transactions.  So in order to prevent double spends, you need to make sure your transaction is confirmed into the blockchain, and then each and every block that is built on top makes it exponentially less probable that an attacker can double spend it (assuming the attacker does not control >50% of the total processing power of the network).': 36, 'it is.  they run multiple instances of their own nodes.': 2, 'https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/324pq3/can_the_10minute_confirmation_time_ever_be/cq7we68\n\n> If transaction would be twice fast, you would need twice the confirmation for the same security.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/324pq3/can_the_10minute_confirmation_time_ever_be/cq7urzc\n\n> Changing to something like 2 minute blocks would require 5 blocks to get the same security built up as a single 10 minute block while offering no advantage. Services which wait 3 blocks to prevent attacks/double spends would need to wait 15 blocks for the same level of protection.': 1, "For everyone else, the 'first' and 'second' transactions are different.\n\nNot eveyone can agree until someone mines one of them.

All they can do is undo history and undo the transaction. So for a successful double spend they would have to have a signifficant amount of hash power plus the private keys for the addresses where the UTXOs were which were used in the TX. So the Entity which tries to double spend needs to be the same or afiliated with the entity with the signifficant hash power.\n\nBottom line is, that entities with signifficant hash powere will never be able to sign for you, no matter how much power they have. They can only make transactions undone or suddently present another longer chan. Either your transaction is in their or not. They cannot spend anyones money for them.\n\nEdit: Something': 7, 'Search for nodes that are on the same IP or same IP range as the website you buy from.': 1, "*It's not possible if you don't rely on 0-confirmations.": 10, "I believe what you're talking about is if you have enough nodes on the network, you can get a pretty good overview of how a transaction is propagating over the network. Most nodes will reject a second transaction, or double spend, that conflicts with another transaction already in its pool of transactions waiting to be added to a block. The nodes don't have to do this, but most do. One way of double spending is to create two different transactions and announce them to opposite sides of the network at the same time. It's a race to see which node finds a block. But, if you can watch the transaction on the network, and all of the nodes have it without a double spend transaction, you can be a bit more sure that a double spend won't happen even without any blocks confirming. This won't protect you from someone that owns a lot of hashing power, or is doing sneaky stuff with nodes not announcing the transaction.

Similar to saying, "if linux needs microsoft, dell, or HP computers to succeed, it has failed."  You can use bitcoin with *any* platform, it wont succeed or fail due to Paypal, but integration with larger payment processors and increasing its market use case will *absolutely* help adoption of it as a payment network.  And using a third party to package the software/feature in already used services is a simple, widely used, and very common practice to make it easier for merchants to use new technology. \n\nThe protocols of the internet don\'t become less decentralized because a lot of people go to youtube for funny videos.  Same with bitcoin, there is no way everyone will be using bitcoin without other services getting involved in the same way that people benefit from millions of linux servers without having a clue.
