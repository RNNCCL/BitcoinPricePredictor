The whole idea of stealth addresses is that you can know someone\'s stealth address without being able to see the transactions that were sent to it.  So having a transcript of a chat with a stealth address in it will *not* let you find the wallets of either the sender or recipient. On the contrary, directly referencing normal addresses in a chat will directly link you to both the sender and receivers money.  It\'s like the difference between saying on the phone "hey, I\'ll give you $20 next time I see you", or saying "I\'ll give you $20 and the serial number on the note is X1234..".. it\'s just unnecessary info to include in the chat.\n\n> Besides, what are you going to do, skip discussion of price and product? :p\n\nWho said anything about prices or products?

He can send Alice an invoice which will have an unique address.\n4.

It means there's still a middleman, but at least it would separate the knowledge of the transactions away from the messaging platform.\n\nIn order to know that you've received a payment to a stealth address, you need to know the public key which the payer used.\n\nOne way to communicate this information is through the blockchain itself, in the form of data included in an OP_RETURN output. The advantage to this is that the blockchain is reliable. The disadvantage is that you've got to scan all of it to find your payments (or have someone else do it for you).\n\nThis is not the only way. If the payer and payee have a direct communication channel (instant message, email, bitmessage, etc), then the payer can give them that public key directly.\n\nThere's nothing wrong with sharing the public key over more than one channel.

You'd like to publish a single donation address/QR code because that's easy and makes sense. However, doing this erodes your own privacy and that of your donors, because all payments flow through the same address. So you post a stealth address instead.\n\nA stealth address works like an inverted HD wallet, in which the payee, not the payer, determines the key pair offset for each payment. The offset is communicated to the payer as a Diffie-Hellman shared secret stored on the block chain. The payer needs to scan the block chain to find the shared secret, decode it, and generate the key pair that will unlock the payment. \n\nOver Skype, PGP would also work as a way for the payer to communicate the payment address.

My initial thought were that someone with a large amount of computing power who really cared could be doing this analysis if they had the computer resources. Now I'm convinced that my laptop could analyze most of the coinjoin transactions that have ever occurred in a few hours, therefore the barrier to entry for spying is very low.\n\nSo to reiterate, the purpose of my experiment was not to expose the leakage of SharedSend (as has been pointed out by others), but to estimate the computation time needed to find any privacy leaks if they have occurred - and the take away is **no time at all**.": 2, "Excellent post.

(they are cyber crime investigators, if they meant btc addresses they would have made sure to get that across)\n\nAnd the fact that those records where deleted is a big deal. Whoever stole the coins, had not only access to move MT.Gox balances around, but also the ability to hide all their activity and the ability + desire to delete their traces afterwards.\n\nNow consider this, if someone was skilled enough to gain such access within MT.Gox from the outside, wouldn\'t you assume they would be able to make the deleted data unrecoverable? And why would they be interested in hiding those arbitrary traces in the first place? (seems like only an insider would)\n\nWouldn\'t it also be in the "hackers" best interest to keep the MT.Gox ship rolling by siphoning off smaller amounts and walk away at a reasonable time with arguably more value and "peace of mind" instead causing the chaos and international interest?\n\nAlso it goes a long way to imply that the "creation of MT.Gox funds" was a recurring thing, which begs the question, how could they not notice? I would imagine the share volume of funds moving is near impossible to not notice, at so many different steps. And when considering it went unnoticed until almost all the funds was gone is ridiculous and can only mean that 1 person had access to view the relevant data, and that same person obv is at blame.\n\nIn my view its sortof obv what happend:\n\nAs we know karpelles bought MT.Gox and "transformed" it into an Bitcoin exchange website. I would assume this was not that easy, and as we know at that point Karpelles was a "strugling" webdesigner of trade with several shady practices and undelivered/failed projects.\n\nNow, running the exchange in the early days probably was not that profitable, the volume was low, many bugs, and whatever the site did make was probably in BTC, which at that time was unstable as fuck.\n\nSo, what does Karpelles do? Well he starts using the users balances for operational and living costs. Not that surprising/shocking at all, he needs to eat and atm all his attention is within this project and in fact its super common for business that hold users money todo so, although its illegal. Its not that risky either as it can easily be estimated what amount of "dead money" is sitting there on average. Even Full tilt poker, one of the most reputable poker sites in the world did it, and went bankrupt. How did they go bankrupt? Because of an "unexpected market change" which was that the FBI froze their accounts for allowing gambling in the US. Now they had to pay the players back, but oops, that money was not there. Now, same situation with MT.Gox, an "unexpected market change" which in this case was an astronomical rise in value. And suddenly those worhless Bitcoins Karpelles lived on was worth 1k+. Not to mention that operational costs increased significantly as well, causing Karpelles to digg deeper into user funds while Btc continued to skyrocket + most of the trading profit MT.Gox made was on Btc that didn\'t actually exist.\n\n#terribletiming.\n\nBtw, the only difference in these two examples is that Fulltilt poker didn\'t try to hide the fact, and "claim a hack" as MT.Gox did, as it would be impossible to do so in their case. However with bitcoin its convenient and feasible to go that route and for sure what a lot of people would have attempted in similar spot. Its so easy to say "not my fault, it was hacked" much easier than to say "I used users funds to finance the website and my own living expenses as I had carefully estimated that the average user balance volume was sufficient to maintain the site, I had no choice, I needed money and who would have thought Bitcoin would suddenly be worth 500x more in just a couple months.\n\nTo not believe in this theory, you would have to say that Karpelles who has been proven to have done shady business deals in the past, suddenly had access to a reasonable amounts of "dead money" just sitting in users accounts, without touching any of it....\n\nNow factor in that MT.Gox employes said that Karpelles was "distant and rarely at the office leading up to the crisis" #anxiety #guilt\n\nAnd when he couldn\'t ignore the elepanth in the room that he created, he scrambled for any excuse blaming a transaction problem everyone had known about for years and that now investigators says was insignificant. To me this is evidence of a "trend", whenever Karpelles is under pressure he takes the most convenient route, and in this case,  fessing up to using costumers bitcoins in the early days just isn\'t that easy to to.\n\n\nThe end\n#2014\n\nBtw, for the record I have 200btc on gox, (or 200btc invested into MT.Gox and Karpelles living expenses) whichever way you want to put it.\n\n': 83, "Your translation sounds to me like it's talking about MtGox accounts...": 7, '> The balance of this account suddenly increased, even though there was no record of buying bitcoins.\n\nFrom this sentence, I would think that they are referring to a MtGOX account.

To spend or move those bitcoins you need the "private key" of that account, which is basically a long password. \n\nBitcoins differ from money in the bank, though, in that the "bitcoin bank" does not know the passwords to the accounts, and cannot move bitcoins without it --- because there is no "bitcoin bank".\n\nThe way you "open an account" to store bitcoins is: you run a program in your computer that spews an address (which you can trust no one has used before) and its private key.  You tell the address to other people so that they can send bitcoins to you.  You keep the private key secret, and use it only when you want to send those bitcoins to some other address.  \n\nYour bitcoins can be stolen if someone else discovers the private key to the address where they are sitting.  There are many ways hackers and thieves can do that, too many to list here.  Any trick they can use to steal ordinary passwords from your computer or your pocket can be used for private keys.  There are a few extra tricks that are specific to bitcoin keys.  Once they get your private keys, they can immediately move your bitcoins to addresses of their own.  In fact, malware in your computer can do that by itself, without sending the keys to the thief.\n\nThieves can trick you into giving them the keys.  For example, you may run into a website that helps you find a "vanity address", that starts with letters of your choice, such as \' 1BigJoe91x..." instead of random letters and digits like "1x8PtzQ91x...".  Such a site can easily keep a copy of the private key. \n\nThieves can also try to trick you into sending the bitcoins to their address instead of the address you intended.  Again there are many ways of doing this.\n\nThere are many companies that will keep your bitcoins for you, just as a bank can keep your cash, and promise to given them back whenever you ask. These include all exchanges, some payment processors like Coinbase, online bitcoin casinos, bitcoin investment funds, some merchants.  If such a company is dishonest or incompetent, you may never get your bitcoins back.  Try to leave as little bitcoins as possibe in them.\n \nOne thing to keep in mind is that there is no "bitcoin bank" that can reverse transactions that stole your coins.
