It's negotiating to protect government funds from being cut, which currently go to health care, education, jobs programmes etc. Austerity is crushing the Greek people, which is why this government who resists it is so popular, and why Greece is doing everything it can to squeeze out enough money to pay its interest while negotiating a better deal for the Greek people, while balancing on the verge of collapse, and hinting at pivoting relations with Russia. And to do that, it's imperative that you don't have a tiny bunch of rich ass Greeks who take all their money and leave the country to protect themselves, collapsing banks and screwing over everyone in Greece who have no other option but to pass incredibly harsh austerity measures for the next decade or face total collapse.\n\nIs it an ideal solution?

I'm in the Netherlands and the way the media covers this story is extremely, extremely one-sided, catering to the Western-European governments and big businesses, they act like Greeks are all corrupt, lazy leachers.

Of course not. We're talking about the very rich in Greece who want to withdraw $20m and flee the country, screwing over the entire lower and middle class.

The point of a blockchain is to establish and verify decentralized consensus of peers who do not trust each other.  If you can just tell the other 'peers' what to do anyway through exclusion or an override mechanism, as banks think they should be able to, then a blockchain is redundant.  If one bank prefers their own blockchain, then why wouldn't every bank prefer their own blockchain?  Now every bank has a blockchain that proves that the bank agrees with itself.  That gets them what?  Meanwhile, Bitcoin is still the only way for any person on the internet to send money to any other person in any country without requiring permission from any middleman.\n\nI agree with you that bank controlled blockchains are not exciting.": 1, "No, the network would not be decentralized because access control is not decentralized.\n\nYour scenario asserts that only banks will be allowed to mine on this network.  What entity or person decides who is a bank and which banks are allowed to participate?  That entity can control access to the network, therefore that entity can control the consensus by banishing any 'peer' banks that disagree with himself.  In Bitcoin terms, the access controlling entity can 51% attack his network at will.  The other mining 'peers' cannot stop him, because any 'peer' who disagrees will have their access revoked.\n\nI put 'peer' in quotes because the other participants in the network are not actually peers of the access controlling entity.  The access controlling entity has power over the other participants.\n\nThis is in stark contrast to the Bitcoin network.  The Bitcoin network is a network of peers.  Anyone can mine, anyone can run a node, anyone can read the source code, anyone can generate a wallet, anyone can receive a payment, anyone can make a payment.  This public access is crucial to the concept of decentralization.  No peer in Bitcoin has the power to banish any other peer.  They are all equally legitimate.  The conceptual leap of the blockchain is that it allows trust based on mathematics and NOT on trust of an access controlling entity who vets participants and excludes those he disagrees with.  \n\nA bank controlled blockchain can never have these features.  Any users of a bank controlled blockchain must consider their funds on that blockchain to be under the control of the controlling bank.  In contrast, Bitcoin allows peer funds to remain under the control of that peer and only that peer.": 2, "Banks are not replacing internal ledgers, but rather are interested in a shared platform that any bank can use.

Miners can decrease the block size if they win a block.  BIP 100 allows them to vote with every coinbase for a new limit, and every 12,000 blocks / 3 months the top/bottom 20% values are tossed, and the most repeated minimum vote amount is used, which cannot exceed 2x the previous 12,000 block limit.\n\nThat's not the same thing as winning a block and choosing to put in fewer transactions.  This is a voting system where miners can influence the maximum block size accepted for a 12,000 block period for all miners.  \n\nMaking such a sloppy comparison is dangerous.  Let me give you an example.  Let's say I've invested, oh, I don't know, eight figures in side chains or 2.0 protocols.  I have friends who mine and make most of their income through the coinbase reward, not transaction fees today.  Maybe I control a pool as well and win 30% of blocks?  \n\nWhat is to stop me from repeatedly voting /BV100000/ for a 12,000 block period, and getting 10% of the block votes for a consistent 100KB cap?  What if other miners are not consistent in their choices and choose 8000000, 7500000, or other values, and by sheer consistency I'm able to drop the block size limit well below what is needed to run the network today?  \n\nOr maybe I play the long game, wait for 5MB blocks to become common, and then force the size down to 1MB in order to force a safety value effect.  I now create an incentive for users to adopt my now live and in production non merged sidechain to escape the now 3 month log jammed bitcoin, screw over the community, but make myself incredibly rich as all the bitcoin money becomes demand for my own cryptocurrency?\n\nNow we need a floor to prevent attacks in the other direction.  Dynamic block limits are not fully baked.  The people coming up with these ideas are a hell of a lot smarter than most of the people in this sub, but advocating them is dangerous.  \n\nI think an 8mb cap doubling every 2 years is the safest, simplest solution. It doesn't create new influences by network participants/miners that we haven't possibly figured out.  Voting is a new dynamic.  It's unprecedented.

Mini-biomes like OpenBazaar (or whatever arises from its ashes) will be nearly as complex as the Bitcoin ecosystem is today. In a bid to stay relevant, universities will start offering courses not only in Bitcoin but in sub-branches of it, financial institutions will have entire departments consisting of people with titles like Ricardian Contract Engineer, and governments will be twisting themselves into pretzels as various branches and individuals try to restrict or capitalize on the revolution, eyeing either tax revenue or investment returns from secret personal "offshore" holdings. \n\nSpeaking of offshoring, I think the next big plateau in the $10K area will have arrived by then and that is when the dynamics will be right for a substantial portion of offshore holdings to move into Bitcoin, pushing the price to even greater heights once the new challenges at that level of adoption are overcome. \n\nIn 3 years no one single person will be able to grasp the entire picture, and so around that time I predict there will be a push to fully implement market forces into all aspect of Bitcoin so that it can self-regulate.

The user can choose how much they want to participate in the network (more participation means more decentralized use), but using Bitcoin directly means never being *required* to depend on any centralized agency.  \n\n> aaaaand we think it's precious because it's not common around the world and we give it a value etc.\nalso There's a huge campaign/Lobby that supports Bitcoin which to give it some value to show like it is precious thing(claim it's precious until it is actually precious)  \n\n> That's all cool..  \n\n> You would argue big corporates and companies supporting it like yahoo or other travel pages but it looks like they look like they in it just in case, you know to get a piece of it..  \n\nWhether bitcoin is precious or not is in the eye of the beholder. What the algorithm guarantees for as long as Bitcoin exists is true and verifiable *scarcity*.  \n\nI'd dispute that there's a huge campaign or lobby for Bitcoin. Bitcoin and its community are still tiny in the overall scheme of things. There's really no PR budget for it to speak of. However, large organizations are starting to realize the platform for innovation that Bitcoin represents. Venture capital is entering the space at an accelerating rate. The small community that does exist around it is generally composed of people that really believe in it and so are ardent activists. The combination of these factors seems to be finally raising Bitcoin's profile.  \n\n> What else advantage Bitcoin has I can't see  \n\nThis is actually a big subject. The advantages you've touched on so far are only part of Bitcoin's primary function as a digital asset/digital currency/store of value/payment network. You didn't mention that it's also borderless, very highly available (no banker's hours, holidays or weekends off), quite reliable, censorship and seizure resistant, highly secure (when used properly), does not expose private details through its use, potentially universal as opposed to being tied to nation-states, impossible to counterfeit/self-verifying, and can be highly transparent or virtually anonymous depending on how it's employed. It's also *programmable*.  \n\nAnd that leads in to the next big advantage of Bitcoin, that it's not just limited to this first application as a digital asset/payment network. It's also the world's first method for achieving consensus across a distributed network composed of nodes you don't need to trust. This means it can be open to everyone and serve as a platform for permission-less innovation. Where this may eventually lead is difficult to fully imagine at this point. [This site has just one list of potential applications](http://ledracapital.com/blog/2014/3/11/bitcoin-series-24-the-mega-master-blockchain-list).

There's also the theory that a government using a currency immune to arbitrary money supply inflation (currency printing/quantitative easing) would be less prone to severe boom-and-bust economic cycles and less able to incur mountains of unsustainable debt.  \n\n> what can an invester do? except buying some bitcoin and keeping on the side aand praying to bitcoin get a higher value (and making lobby LOL)  \n\nAs Bitcoin itself is still new, companies in the Bitcoin space are typically quite young and still privately held. As a result, the average investor can't invest directly in Bitcoin-related companies so far. This should be changing pretty quickly in coming years.  \n\nMeanwhile, if you study Bitcoin and come to believe in its potential, price discovery of bitcoin as a digital asset is still occurring. So in that sense, you're correct that buying and holding bitcoin right now is the most direct way to invest in the technology. Ironically, bitcoin the unit won't completely fulfill it's potential as a digital asset until it's much more mature, and price discovery is essentially complete. Only then will volatility be dramatically reduced. At that point bitcoin could very well have better monetary characteristics than conventional alternatives, but buying and holding it as an investment with high growth potential may not make much sense. Still, if it is still around, companies doing Bitcoin-related business would be more established and likely have shares publicly available on stock exchanges, etc. Then Bitcoin-related investment opportunities would be plentiful.  \n\n> Explain it to me why it's currency of future or is it another thing to make some people rich  \n\nBitcoin could be both, but it's early days yet. Purchasing and holding bitcoin should be viewed as a high risk investment, so the often used cliche still holds: best not to invest more than you can afford to lose.  \n\nAside from investing directly in Bitcoin, everyone can still avail themselves of its usefulness. Exchanging fiat currency for bitcoin and then utilizing it quickly can minimize exposure to volatility. Alternatively, businesses are offering more and more options everyday that leverage Bitcoin's advantages. Many such services should be significantly cheaper than conventional alternatives, or be available in regions that were formerly unserved.  \n\nEven better yet, you could learn how to develop with and for Bitcoin, and create your own beneficial service at essentially no cost to you aside from your invested time. No one is obligated to use Bitcoin, but it is openly available to all that find it useful.": 1, 'Here\'s how I usually explain what Bitcoin is and why it matters:\n\nThe reason it\'s so hard for most people to understand Bitcoin is that most people don\'t really understand money. Money isn\'t wealth. It\'s an accounting system used to facilitate the exchange of wealth. (The paradox of money is that while everyone wants it, no one actually wants it - they want the stuff they can buy with it!) Many people are put off by the fact that bitcoins are "just zeroes and ones." But that\'s what ALL money is, information! More precisely, money is a means for credibly conveying information about value given but not yet received (or at least not yet received in a form in which it can directly satisfy a person\'s wants or needs).\n\nTo put it yet another way, money is a ledger. With fiat currencies like the dollar, that ledger is centralized. And that gives the central authority responsible for maintaining that ledger tremendous power, power that history has proven will inevitably be abused. With Bitcoin, the ledger is decentralized. And that means that no one individual or entity has the power to arbitrarily create new units (thereby causing inflation), freeze (or seize) your account, or block a particular payment from being processed. We\'ve had decentralized money before. After all, no one can simply print new gold into existence. And the "ledger" of gold is distributed because the physical gold itself (the "accounting entries" in the metaphor) is distributed. But with gold, that decentralization comes at a heavy price (literally). The physical nature of gold makes it hugely inefficient from a transactional perspective.\n\nEnter Bitcoin.\n\nIt is the first currency in the world that is BOTH decentralized AND digital. It is more reliably scarce than gold, more transactionally efficient than "modern" digital banking, and enables greater financial privacy than cash. It could certainly still fail for one reason or another, but if it doesn\'t, it has the potential to be very, VERY disruptive.\n\nAnd here\'s a somewhat more detailed explanation: [Two Approaches to Conceptualizing Bitcoin\'s Core Value Proposition](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/36wxdl/two_approaches_to_conceptualizing_bitcoins_core/).': 6, "It's basically just a global database that is indestructible and has a limited number of units.

Here are some thoughts that might need to be incorporated into such proposals though:\n\n(1) When reducing the max block size, should the max be reduced immediately, or gradually?\n\n(2) Should reduction of the max block size be based on some adjustment algorithm, where the values of recent transaction fees are considered?\n\n(3) Does it only go down, or does the adjustment algorithm allow it to go back to 1 MB to relieve pending transaction pressure?\n\n(4) What's the absolute smallest max block size that the network could tolerate without imploding?\n\nAnd now for my obligatory statement of neutrality: I really don't mind if the max block size is not reduced, but I think that it is interesting to speculate about.": 1, "You're essentially arguing that people shouldn't lie, and I would agree: people shouldn't lie.

Remember that while hashes are easy to reproduce, they\xe2\x80\x99re impossible to predict and they seem to function completely randomly, so the miner has no way of predicting what chunk of random data will produce what hash, he just has to keep changing that chunk until he gets the result he\xe2\x80\x99s looking for. Eventually, some miner somewhere finds a chunk of random data that produces a hash that is smaller than a certain value, as determined by the difficulty, and submits this block and its accompanying hash to the Bitcoin network. Once the network confirms the solution is correct, the miner is rewarded with a number of Bitcoins."\n\nNote: I\'m presenting to IT people.... not just the regular joe.
