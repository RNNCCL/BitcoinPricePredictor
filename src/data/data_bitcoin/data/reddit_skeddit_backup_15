For that reason, I also use Bitcoin Core 0.12.1 - only for receiving funds. That\'s because it has the highest level of validation of any client: there is no need to trust the miners or companies if you use that client to receive. I then send the funds on to my Electrum client.\n\nI also own a Trezor hardware wallet, but I find it a bit clunky and "v1-ish"\n': 3, "Coinbase is fine to buy from - but their wallet should not be used.\n\nUnfortunately their company and employees have shown bad faith to the community, locked and banned accounts without being forthcoming about the reasons why, and they enforce arbitrary and hidden rules about how to use their service that are related to their banking partner relationships\n\nUsing their wallet you put your money at risk of being frozen or lost. You put your account at risk of being banned in a false positive, or just for an arbitrary reason. That's why I strongly recommend that you never ever use Coinbase as a wallet and limit your interactions with them to buying and selling for fiat.\n": 2, "> Is 'Bitcoin Wallet' the mobile version of 'Bitcoin Core' ?\n\nNo, it is not.

Get ready for a weird summer.": 1, 'The foundation of money is trust, and there is very little that is trustworthy about any of this. \n\nIn my view, this whole affair can be reasonably seen as an attack on the creditworthiness of the currency by route of changing the Satoshi myth from one that points us to trust in math, to one that points us to trusting in a human being instead (and one who is incidentally untrustworthy). \n\nAt the root of money is confidence, and what stems from confidence is creditworthiness. The reason that fiat currencies have value is because they are backed by government debt and government is considered the most creditworthy entity in any given society. \n\nBitcoin replaces the need for the money to be backed by a creditworthy institution with mathematical proof of ownership and fixed supply that provides proof of creditworthiness. Bitcoin becomes a global accounting system which cannot be forged or tampered with. Every transaction has a debit and credit and the whole system always remains balanced measured by the total monetary supply. This means the system is utterly trustworthy and this is what gives it value. \n\nIn order to attack this value you must attack trust in Bitcoin, and since you cannot do that by hacking the system or by pretending math, you must instead hack the image of the system. One of the primary ways to do so would be to hack the myth which teaches us that Bitcoin does not depend on trust in human beings. This myth is vital to understanding why Bitcoin is valuable despite its image for being untrustworthy in the press.  This is the myth of Satoshi Nakamoto.\n\nThe point of the myth of Satoshi Nakamoto is to be symbolic of how the entire system works. That is, your identity is inconsequential to the ability to use the money and trust its validity. In the fiat system your identity is fundamental, in Bitcoin it doesn\'t matter. This shows that the creditworthiness of digital money no longer lies in individuals or human institutions.\n\nIn order to attack this myth and erode confidence in the system the attackers need to at least present the possibility that Satoshi was separated from his/her keys to erode faith in the system as math and introduce an element of trust in humans at the foundation of the system\'s creditworthiness. \n\nThey need a narrative, for instance, in which Satoshi was actually two people. One Satoshi had the keys, the other did not but trusted the former to hold the keys on both of their behalves. Conveniently, the Satoshi that was holding the keys died leaving the other Satoshi, "Satoshi without his keys."\n\nThis kind of myth would at least return the mythology of Bitcoin from being a system whose creditworthiness derives from math -- in which the mythic figure Satoshi was nobody and therefore symbolized the insignificance of the human individual to establish creditworthiness -- to the domain of traditional currencies whose creditworthiness derives from trust in human beings. Satoshi is the figure that represents the system\'s creditworthiness, his private keys represents the fact that the system\'s creditworthiness depends on math, his loss of those private keys represents our new need to trust a human being at his word that he is actually the source of creditworthiness. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n': 1, "**tldr:**\n\n> In order to attack \\[Bitcoin,\\] the attackers need to at least present the possibility that Satoshi was separated from his/her keys, \\[and thereby\\] erode faith \\[in\\] math and introduce an element of trust in humans at the foundation of the system's creditworthiness.": 1, "[**@TomerKantor**](https://twitter.com/TomerKantor):\n>[2016-05-05 06:00:47 UTC](https://twitter.com/TomerKantor/status/728102120071684098)\n\n>Team Satoshi is ephemeral, and no cryptographic multisig can now capture those that aren't around any more @iang\\_fc \n>[*metzdowd.com*](http://www.metzdowd.com/pipermail/cryptography/2016-May/029323.html)\n\n----\n\n[^[Mistake?]](/message/compose/?to=TweetPoster&subject=Error%20Report&message=/4hyz7t%0A%0APlease leave above link unaltered.)\n[^[Suggestion]](/message/compose/?to=TweetPoster&subject=Suggestion)\n[^[FAQ]](/r/TweetPoster/comments/13relk/)\n[^[Code]](https://github.com/joealcorn/TweetPoster)\n[^[Issues]](https://github.com/joealcorn/TweetPoster/issues)\n": 2}, ('Craig Wright Exits The Bitcoin Stage With Weird Blog Post', 7): {}, ('So.. my girlfriend comes home and tells me "DID YOU HEAR THE NEWS?!

": 5, 'I\'ve wondered about the possibility of a saboteur element, if it does exist and I\'ve seen enough baseless attacks on devs, MIT, Uphold and other startups that I actually hope there are saboteurs and that the community isn\'t this horrible. I definitely don\'t think OP is one---I\'ve seen their posts here and there and skimming through this they seem to care about btc and are probably smarter than me. But, and **this is what genuinely bums me out**, OP comes to the conclusion that this (Wright stuff) is some kind of attack on Core from the \'big block side\'. One of my biggest takeaways from all the wright nonsense is that Gavin really got screwed since he put his reputation on the line and seems to have genuinely thought this guy was legit. And no, I\'m **not** saying that this was an attack on Gavin or Classic or etc. What I\'m saying is that whoever these saboteurs were/are they did a great job of dividing and then blinding us. If it\'s not clear yet then consider an analogous circumstance to the Republican/Dem split where each side just gets the news from sources that reinforce their own viewpoints. I admit I even ended up drinking some of the kool-aid back when this started before I realized how messed up things were.              \n\nI wish I had a good/hopeful/convincing point to make but all I can offer is: if your only involvement beyond usage in the btc community is on reddit, then you are in trouble (whether r/bitcoin, r/btc, r/btwhatever). You\'d call someone that gets all their news from only one outlet a moron right?  if this is you then get on freenode or something. What are you still doing here? Go!         \n    \n\nAnd just to be clear on where I fall:     \n* I think 2MB blocks are needed and it is preferable to Segwit right now. \n* But I think 2MB blocks should be done to buy time until the Lightning Network can be deployed because that\'s the most promising true scaling solution.     \n* I even think replace-by-fee is mostly harmless...        \n Didn\'t seem to be a problem when it was in the client before---just like when we had no block size limit (or was it 32mb? either way...) I see segwit as riskier and a lot of work for a low return and I see 2mb blocks as better performing on test and more safe. But at this point, if Segwit is deployed and we get the added tx throughput and the network doesn\'t require any emergency hard forks then I think that\'s great and I\'m all for it. Same with Classic though, Classic\'s existence isn\'t a threat to Bitcoin. It\'s a feature of it! Ideally miners will act in their own self-interest and pick the best solution. I mean c\'mon thats day 1 stuff.    \n   To me, both accomplish the same thing in making the blockchain stronger and give us some breathing room until Lightning or another solution can be deployed. I think that /u/gavinandresen /u/nullc /u/luke-jr and so many other btc code contributors who had a perfectly reasonable difference of opinion got screwed by the bitcoin community. They made them symbolic leaders at different ends of this "us" vs. "them" battle dichotomy that never existed in the first place and the community at large could have let this run it\'s course and let the best solution win. But instead users took the liberty of launching truly disgusting personal attacks on "the other side\'s leaders" ranging from wikipedia edit history to their religion---as if they were nobly doing a favor for "their side\'s leaders". What was, at most, a passionate but academic difference of opinion was hijacked into this parade of horribles. Bitcoin will survive of course. But is this how we thank the people that have put in just as much time and effort as Satoshi? Plus, I\'m sure as hell Satoshi will never come forward after seeing how this community expresses gratitude. So yeah, I hope there are saboteurs because if this is all from the community then I\'m going to need a drink.      \nI didn\'t mean for this comment to be so long and I doubt anyone will read it but I\'m hoping OP or a similar user will be swayed---not to "core" or "classic" but to the middle and/or out of here(reddit).

First, there must be a quick discussion on the meaning of \xe2\x80\x9cproof,\xe2\x80\x9d and Gavin\xe2\x80\x99s intended method of proof.  Then, once \xe2\x80\x9cproof\xe2\x80\x9d is understood, there must be a discussion on motive.\n\nProof is a nuanced word.  In mathematics it means something entirely different than it does in matters regarding human affairs.  Mathematical proof is something far more concrete.  However, to prove that Wright is Satoshi is actually an matter that consists only of persuasion.  This is the nature of \xe2\x80\x9clegal proof.\xe2\x80\x9d  Had no one re-formatted the signature and discovered it on the block chain, Gavin and company would have proven (not in the mathematical sense) to lots of people that Wright is Satoshi.  Had days passed, before the forgery was discovered, lots of people would still be convinced that Wright is Satoshi (the whole bias from first impressions).  Indeed, some diehards are still convinced that Wright is Satoshi despite the damning forgery.  Notwithstanding your understanding of the word prove, Gavin could convince lots of people that Wright is Satoshi if no one quickly discovered the signature.  That\xe2\x80\x99s risky, but it is not far-fetched.\n\nThe bitch of it is someone discovered the forgery within 90 minutes\xe2\x80\x94well before the false impression had time to propagate.  And that\xe2\x80\x99s when Gavin screwed up royally.  That\xe2\x80\x99s when he \xe2\x80\x9cproved\xe2\x80\x9d to everyone that he is lying.\n\nRight now, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to detour on the way to motive to show **how anyone can know he is lying.**\n\nTo determine that he is lying, you don\xe2\x80\x99t need to know what he supposedly saw, or what was said.  All you have to realize is that as soon as Gavin learned that the public signature was a forgery, if he truly believed prior (that Wright is Satoshi), then this revelation would have made him doubt\xe2\x80\x94reasonably doubt. After all, the signature he supposedly verified was under extremely suspect circumstances (in a London hotel room chosen by Wright; on Wright\xe2\x80\x99s computer; and with Wright retaining all of the \xe2\x80\x9cevidence\xe2\x80\x9d). After learning of the forgery, no reasonable person would think it unlikely they were tricked. But instead, Gavin lies and says he believes Wright is Satoshi \xe2\x80\x9cbeyond a reasonable doubt.\xe2\x80\x9d TWICE!\n\nThen Electrum (the company that authors the client software purportedly used for verification) confirmed that no .asc file was even downloaded from the U.K. on the day of the supposed \xe2\x80\x9cverification.\xe2\x80\x9d And after all this and even more time to deliberate, Gavin decides to bolster the fabrication via twitter. Gavin is lying. He knows damn well that Wright is not Satoshi. These are the actions of a desperate man.\n\n**On to motive.**  This is where many are getting tripped up; it\xe2\x80\x99s actually quite simple when you see it.\n\nFor some time now, Gavin has been drifting into irrelevance. And being the Bitcoin guy THE thing Gavin has to distinguish himself.  This distinction has, for the last several years, landed him the best seat in the house and a cushy job that requires little actual work. Those are surely in jeopardy if he can't pull off some miracle to make himself relevant again.  The XT fail was bad.  The Classic fail was worse.  Those failures make it clear that in time, Gavin will be completely irrelevant.\n\nIf Gavin wishes to salvage his relevance it will require something drastic.  Desperate times accordingly resulted in desperate measures.  If no one would have re-formatted the signature and searched it on the blockchain then Wright would have a lot of people believing he is Satoshi right now.  And Gavin would have a lot of people believing Satoshi whole-heartedly backs Gavin.  It\xe2\x80\x99s fairly risky to hope no one will find that signature, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not far-fetched that they will not.  It is definitely a \xe2\x80\x9cHail Mary\xe2\x80\x9d type move, but Gavin has quite a bit at stake, and the agony of defeat is looming.\n\nThat is the motive.  And it perfectly and reasonably explains the behavior.  The real bitch of all of this is that it only took about 90 minutes for the fake signature to be determined a forgery.  That was not enough time for the hopeful belief that Wright is Satoshi to even propagate (people form strong biases around initial impressions).  Accordingly, before the idea could even take hold, it was debunked and Gavin was hastily forced to decide how to respond.\n\nHad his decision simply been \xe2\x80\x9cDo I still believe Wright is Satoshi?\xe2\x80\x9d the answer would easily have been, \xe2\x80\x9cI have my doubts.\xe2\x80\x9d  But Gavin\xe2\x80\x99s actual decision was \xe2\x80\x9cShould I stick with my story, or should I give up on regaining my relevance?\xe2\x80\x9d  That\xe2\x80\x99s where he made the mistake.  He did not realize that sticking with his story was not a real option.  He did not realize that there was absolutely no way to still convince people.  In a hasty act of desperation he chose to stick with his lie.  Like so many acts of desperation, it has completely exposed his character.": 1, "If that was actually true then BIP101 is completely a shittastic way to do that because it basically guaranteed that at least 90% of users could run full nodes at home for a minimum of the next 2 decades  AND also because datacenters can be located all over the Earth and thus be under no single government's direct purview.

It's not as though if FDIC insurance gets triggered then the government just prints up a whole bunch of new money and floods the system with it.  The FDIC is an actual insurance company; they collect premiums and insure against loss.  Those premiums come from existing currency in circulation, and that's where the money gets paid from.  Also, if your bank goes insolvent, that doesn't mean that the bank evaporates and its assets plummet to zero; it just means that they don't have sufficient assets or liquidity to pay *all* of their creditors (including depositors).  That's enough to make them insolvent, but whatever assets the bank has left are available to compensate depositors or the FDIC or whoever else.\n\nI'm not saying that it wouldn't be seriously expensive for the FDIC if a bank (or several banks) went insolvent, but I don't think that leads to a dilution of the dollar in the way you seem to think it does.
