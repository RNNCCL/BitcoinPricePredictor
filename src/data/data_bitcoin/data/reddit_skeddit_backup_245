Both Tibado and Bitcoin are aimed at electronic cash but in totally different ways and with different assumptions. The core difference is in the architecture where Bitcoin uses the decentralised Blockchain to manage a virtual currency and Tibado uses a centralised Blockchain based on fiat currency. There is no speculative element with Tibado.\n \nBitcoin is well established and Tibado is very new but Tim Jones, my cofounder and I believe there is a real need for cash with an electronic form factor. So Tibado apart from being anonymous is immediate and irrevocable and has zero transaction fees because it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have the proof of work necessary for the Blockchain consensus. Our business model is based on seigniorage just like cash.\n \nWe intend to make a developer web site available in December and hope people will experiment further to see if it meets their particular needs but at core it\xe2\x80\x99s very good at handling instant low value payments in high volume and we see that sort of payment profile increasing on the internet over the next few years and believe that zero transaction fees will be an important characteristic to many merchants. Whereas Bitcoin is an ownership transfer model, Tibado is an asset transfer model where the users look after their own coins.\n \nThere a lot of information on our web site but I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to answer any particular questions you may have.\n \nBest regards,\n \nDavid.": 1}, ('TradeFortress is on teamspeak', 0): {}, ('If nuclear fusion ever becomes a reality, what effect will unlimited energy have on Bitcoin mining?', 0): {"It wouldn't be unlimited.": 2, '[Seems legit](http://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/48335/is-keshes-technology-for-real).\n\n:S\n': 1, 'Shifts power from Saudi arabia to western countries?': 1, "It won't be unlimited and it won't be free.

This channel is \nrepresented as an entry on the bitcoin public ledger. In order to spend funds from the channel, both parties must agree \non the new balance. The current balance is stored as the most recent transaction signed by both parties, spending \nfrom the channel address. To make a payment, both parties sign a new exit transaction spending from the channel \naddress. All old exit transactions are invalidated by doing so. \n\nIn very basic terms, you and I agree to create a multisig address and I load 1 BTC in there via the blockchain. At that point, we can transact chunks of that bitcoin back and forth as much as we want without any blockchain confirmations. If either of us wants to close the deal, we can just walk away with whatever balance we each have at the time. This closes the 2-way payment channel and the multisig address is emptied into each of our own addresses on the blockchain. \n\nLightning doesn\'t have its own blockchain. It\'s a layer being built on top of bitcoin that will allow for millions of secure transactions to occur without bloating the blockchain itself.': 1, "> the only thing preventing bitcoin from replacing credit card transactions at point of sale is (a) adoption of bitcoin, and (b) the transaction fees\n\nSecurity, bitcoin price, ease of use etc are all completely irrelevant.

That\'s why when Chinese get interested in something they have a huge impact, even when it\'s only a slim minority. For example, after the Fukushima incident in Japan there was no salt left anywhere in the country, the shelves were empty and the stockpiles at the mines disappeared overnight, because a *tiny* percentage of the Chinese middle class (mostly middle aged housewives) thought the iodine in salt would protect them from radiation blowing across from Japan. That\'s the kind of power I\'m talking about, and with bitcoin they are only just starting to scratch the surface in a tiny way. So a pump and dump isn\'t necessary to explain the rise in demand, the rise in demand can simply be summed up as "Chinese early adopters". That\'s my take on it anyway.': 12, 'My point is that it\'s not worth $300.  Read my first comment, as I already explained that.  The RMB does not fetch $300, as there are capital controls in place.  You\'re using the official exchange rate, which is only available in restricted quantities, hence why bitcoin is trading at the actual real world RMB value which is less.\n\nThe bottom line is, bitcoins aren\'t worth more in China.  They\'re worth the same as the USD price on US exchanges.  Right now the Huobi price is 1981 yuan which is "officially" (in fantasy land) worth $311 USD.  In the real world (not fantasy land), that yuan is worth $302, equal to the price on USD exchanges.

Licensed banks won\xe2\x80\x99t do it. But middlemen like Mr. Chen, perched in his mini-mart at the front lines of a vast underground currency-exchange and offshore-remittance network, can and often will.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s never a certainty that these things can be done,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Chen, who declined to give his full name. \xe2\x80\x9cBut, usually, when things get stricter, the fee will just be a bit higher.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nFacing a turbulent stock market and a weakening economy, many Chinese are trying to move money offshore. That spells business for operations that can end-run capital controls.\n\nNo official data track the underground transfers, but central-bank officials who attempt to say that underground banks handle about 800 billion yuan ($125 billion) annually, and more than usual this year.\n\nOne sign of unusually high activity in underground banks is a drop in China\xe2\x80\x99s foreign-exchange reserves, an indicator of demand for hard currency. Reserves fell by a record $93.9 billion in August and $43 billion more in September, though part of the reason was central-bank selling to support the yuan.\n\nOften hidden behind the fa\xc3\xa7ades of convenience stores and tea shops, they cater to a clientele ranging from corrupt officials hiding gains to middle-class Chinese trying to buy overseas property. All believe their money is safer abroad or can bring a higher return, a sentiment that has deepened since this summer\xe2\x80\x99s stock-market plunge.\n\nNew York real-estate agent Jiang Jinjin said she has handled nearly 2,000 residential-property purchases this year for Chinese families with children at Columbia University. \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t sleep much this summer. Too many kids looking for apartments,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\n\nSome customers rely on relatives and friends to carry cash over on repeated trips, she said, and some set up U.S. companies. Such firms can be used to overpay for imports, experts on underground banking say. Ms. Jiang said her company checks the provenance of money used to buy real estate.\n\nThe outflows have put underground bankers in China in the cross hairs of financial regulators. China\xe2\x80\x99s capital controls were set up to keep funds onshore when the country was starved for investment. Officials consider them still necessary, to prevent sharp outflows of the kind that shocked developing economies in the 1997 Asian financial crisis. Also, too much cash going out could complicate efforts to stimulate growth through interest-rate cuts.\n\n ENLARGE\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a sign of a loss of confidence in China\xe2\x80\x99s economic outlook, and it certainly makes it more difficult for the central bank to achieve their reform goals,\xe2\x80\x9d said Julian Evans-Pritchard, an economist at research firm Capital Economics.\n\nFor years, underground banking thrived in Shantou and Chaozhou, fiercely entrepreneurial coastal cities that were rife with smuggling, counterfeiting and drug and gun running. Much of the activity has moved to cities near the border with Hong Kong and Macau, former foreign colonies with more-open financial systems. Once mainland money gets to Hong Kong, for instance, it can go pretty much anywhere in the world.\n\nSometimes, large sums are divided into legally allowed amounts and then channeled out of the mainland via hundreds of bank accounts controlled by the underground banker. Underground banks also can match yuan deposited with them on the mainland with equivalent amounts in foreign currency paid into a client\xe2\x80\x99s bank account elsewhere.\n\nThese informal networks, like hawala agents in the Arab world, also enable Chinese workers overseas who can\xe2\x80\x99t open regular bank accounts to send funds back to China.\n\nThe Chinese government says it isn\xe2\x80\x99t rattled by the current bout of outflows, which top officials describe as \xe2\x80\x9cnormal.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnother sign of a pickup in underground activity: Investment in foreign commercial property by Chinese is on track to surpass last year\xe2\x80\x99s $10.5 billion, according to U.S. property-services firm CBRE Group.\n\n Xixiang Pedestrian Street in China's southern city of Shenzhen, once a thriving base for underground banking, was hit in a massive police raid in June.

It began in 2012 when Chan Tat, an elderly Hong Kong businessman, sought to move 63 million yuan from his mainland business to Hong Kong for his retirement, according to an account given by Shenzhen police.\n\nMr. Chan tapped a friend at a commercial bank, who turned to a Shenzhen underground bank. It split the money into three batches. Each was divided into dozens of smaller chunks, then routed to separate bank accounts controlled by the underground bank, before being wired to Hong Kong. Once in Hong Kong, the money was regrouped in an account controlled by Mr. Chan.\n\nAll except for eight million yuan he found missing. Mr. Chan, who couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be reached for comment, tipped off Chinese authorities, according to the police account. It isn\xe2\x80\x99t known what has happened to the 31 people arrested.\n\nRELATED COVERAGE\n\nUnderground Banks Trace Roots to the Sicily of China\nChina Boosts Efforts to Keep Money at Home\nChina Caps Overseas Cash Withdrawals\nWith direct remittances under scrutiny, runners say a preferred method is matchmaking: Give the underground bank a sum, and a matching sum appears in Hong Kong, minus a cut of anywhere between 0.3% and 3%. No money physically or electronically crosses the border; the match is built on networks on both sides controlled by the underground bank.\n\nThe networks make use of family and village ties, said a researcher in the central-bank\xe2\x80\x99s anti-money-laundering unit. \xe2\x80\x9cPeople create and control hundreds of accounts by going into villages to buy national identification cards\xe2\x80\x9d from the poor, the researcher said. The accounts surface and vanish.\n\nIn a fraud case in Hong Kong courts, prosecutors described how a man named Yang Sigai allegedly set up and then closed three bank accounts there. Though none was open longer than seven months, more than 1,000 transfers totaling about $60 million passed through them, according to court records.\n\nThe business was upended after a batch of incoming funds allegedly included $1 million bilked in a phone scam from a Canadian-Chinese man. After he alerted Hong Kong police, they traced the funds to Mr. Yang, who was convicted of fraud, a decision he is appealing. He couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be reached.\n\nThe underground banks near Shenzhen\xe2\x80\x99s railway station are more cautious now but undaunted. When asked about transferring $100,000 offshore, a store operator in the back room of a cigarette shop ruled out electronic transfers, offering instead to have people physically mule it across in small batches.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe policy pressure is high this year, so the risk is higher,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cUnless you know people.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x94Kersten Zhang contributed to this article.": 28}, ('Trevor and Multi-sig?', 0): {"[Here](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Multisignature) you can read what multisignature is..\n\nmyTREZOR.com doesn't support it at this moment, however soon you should be able to use TREZOR with some multisig wallet providers;)": 1, '>can multi-sig be used with Trezor and if so then what wallet could I use?\n\nElectrum 2.xx\n\nAdd-on : https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1156185.msg12307461#msg12307461': 1}, ('"What do you need the money for?"', 36): {"It would seem to me you haven't read a news headline since Snowden came out of the woodwork.

I don\'t think mine knows what a bitcoin is yet :-)\n\nMaybe true but doesn\'t matter. All assets are treated the same for tax purposes. It doesn\'t matter if they\'re BTC or Pokemon cards. Once you turn something back into USD you need to put it on your taxes to protect yourself both from drawing the IRS\' attention and from overpaying them, depending how your holding fared between the time it was bought & sold. Ask your accountant. \n\n> Do I need to declare my bitcoins when filling out by tax return? \n\nYou don\'t declare assets. The IRS cares about income, not wealth. \n\n> If I purchased 200 bitcoins at $200 and they were $300 at year end then do I need to declare this gain?\n\nNot if you\'re still holding them as BTC. Otherwise every stockholder would be reporting absolutely massive gains or losses every single year. For an asset you just need the price of purchase and the price of sale. Interim ups and downs don\'t matter.\n\nWhen you sell an asset for a gain OR LOSS, it becomes either a capital gain or you can write it off. Neglect the former and they\'ll come after you, neglect the latter and you\'re donating to the IRS. Your write-off is at your marginal rate so it can be pretty significant (eg for every $100 you lose on BTC, save $25 on taxes) where the capital gain is taxed at a lower rate. Nobody likes paying taxes but getting a bigger break on losses than bill on gains (for those with considerable income) makes investing in the US a sweetheart deal. This is why tax loss harvesting is so important- you can make money in a volatile but flat market by reducing your overall tax liability. \n\nOne-time gifts are not taxable up to a certain amount (I want to say $12k/annual but that might be outdated). The exchange and value should be documented by the recipient. Depending what happens with the BTC\'s value when it\'s sold, the recipient will need that documentation on the value gifted vs the capital gains (or losses). It\'s good practice for you to document it but the IRS isn\'t going to come after you for something you gave away. \n\nOh and gambling losses in currency are normally similarly tax deductible, but I don\'t know how exactly gambling with BTC works for tax purposes. Ask your accountant. I suspect he\'ll say that exchanging USD for a gambling asset works just like gambling the USD itself. \n\nAlso check a few qualified sources if something seems off *especially* if you\'re not paying taxes on gains, as much as you might want to hear that news. Some people don\'t fully appreciate this fact: You are responsible for your taxes, not your accountant. If you\'re going to have assets you must be personally qualified to deal with the taxes or have an accountant who is. It\'s great you\'re educating yourself here but you need to realize that an accountant who doesn\'t know/understand all your BTC dealings will at best lose you money when they don\'t properly harvest tax losses and at worst expose you to penalties that are either financial, a criminal record that will fuck up your life, and theoretically incarceration but that one is extremely unlikely (the IRS is smart enough to know they need you working to collect money you owe). \n\nThe US government is the best in the world at handling money.

The auction will run for around 20 days, finishing on Thursday Nov 12 at 01:00 UTC (Wednesday Nov 11 at 19:00 PDT), and 100% of the final bid amount will go to Mr Nakamoto.\n\nThe artist, cryptograffiti, was asked by potential bidders for the auction to be made open instead of the original sealed bit format, hence his decision to use bitify\xe2\x80\x99s platform to host the auction.\n\nYou can find out more about Dorian Nakamoto through the AMA he [hosted on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3nzqqh/hi_rbitcoin_i_am_dorian_nakamoto_ama/) earlier this month where you may also ask questions regarding this auction.\n\n[Image 1](https://cache-bitify.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Dorian-Nakamoto-Auction-1.jpg)\n\n[Image 2](https://cache-bitify.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Dorian-Nakamoto-Auction-3.jpg)\n\n[Image 3](https://cache-bitify.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Dorian-Nakamoto-Auction-2.jpg)\n\nAbout the Artwork:\n\nNakamoto, 2014\ndestroyed credit cards, adhesive on wood\n38.6 cm \xc3\x97 31 cm (15.2 in \xc3\x97 12.2 in) including frame\nEnd Date: Thursday November 12, 2015 at 01:00 UTC\n\nAbout the artist:\n\ncryptograffiti\xe2\x80\x99s work explores the benefits of cryptocurrencies vs. the status quo and the possibilities of blending the digital blockchain with physical art. Much like bitcoin itself, he is pseudonymous.\n\ncryptograffiti is the first artist to utilize a public-facing bitcoin address to receive donations for street art. Upon discovering his work, passersby send bitcoin in support of his often controversial messages.\n\ncryptograffiti\xe2\x80\x99s fine art mediums are frequently comprised of tangible materials from industries being disrupted by cryptocurrencies. His work has been featured in The Wall Street Journal, Bitcoin Magazine, the Montreal Bitcoin Embassy and can be found in the collections of numerous prominent figures within the Bitcoin community.\n\ncryptograffiti is excited at how bitcoin will transform the art world and to play a role in leading this new direction.': 4, '[deleted]': 1, 'Thanks.

The public address will always start with a 1 or a 3.\n\nIn this case, you can freely share the public address 1pg6... with anyone and they can choose to send coins to it. That results in a transaction being added to the blockchain with that address as the 'output'.\n\nIn order to spend those coins you need to create a transaction which uses that address as the input and is signed with the private key. When the nodes in the network receive that transaction they can verify it and add it to the blockchain also. They know it's valid because they know the previous transaction put coins there (so it has coins to spend), and they know the owner of the private key signed it (the transaction itself proves this) so a miner will add it to the blockchain.\n\nSo, that's the simplest case, one key pair. For the reasons you mentioned you may want many key-pairs in a wallet, so that you don't re-use the same address more than once (for privacy) or you may want multiple wallets on different devices etc. \n\nA nice solution that emerged for this was HD wallets. With these you use 12 words (easy to backup manually without making a mistake compared to long random strings). from these words a predictable, endless stream of private keys (and of course the associated public keys from those) can be generated. \nAnd this can always be re-done from scratch if you ever lose the wallet for any reason. \n\nSo it's multiple public/priv key pairs per HD wallet (12 words) but not multiple public per private as you assumed. There are more complex wallets (called multi-sig) possible where multiple private keys are created and a decided number of them are required to create transactions, like a joint bank account, but forget about this until you're familiar with the basics.\n": 3, 'thank you! /u/ChangeTip, send $0.10\n': 1, 'Wallets do two things.  Firstly they store your keys.  Secondly, they create and sign transactions with those keys.\n\nThe exception is the piece of paper, which can store keys but obviously can\'t create/sign/broadcast a transaction, as you need software for that.  So a paper wallet is only part of the picture, as eventually you need to type that phrase into some software to spend your money, and then you end up relying on the security of that software and the system it\'s running on.  So I would not recommend a paper wallet as a complete solution.\n\nA hardware wallet is a fully isolated wallet that stores keys and can create/sign transactions, all on the device itself.  Since it is such a simple embedded device, it\'s resistant to malware, unlike a fully fledged computer which can easily be infected with malware.  So hardware wallets are more secure as they protect your keys and never let them leak out of the device.\n\nThe term "cold storage" just refers to keeping bitcoins stored in a wallet where the keys are offline (not sitting in memory of some computer that\'s plugged into the internet).
