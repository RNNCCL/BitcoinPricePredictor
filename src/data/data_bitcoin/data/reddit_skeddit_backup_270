This lower value, to me, represents the minimum computing power need for a "secure" network (Maybe this is my critical error.)  So, continuing with that assumption, any additional hashing power is "wasted" and would only solve the blocks faster, so the difficulty is adjusted to maintain the 10 minute block interval target.  I do feel that higher hash rate improves the networks security IF it is distributed evenly across the mining pools, only because it provides a higher barrier of entry towards the 51% attack. But, IMO, the hash rate is really not the measure of security, the distribution of the hash is really the measure, assuming pools don\'t collude.\n\nBack to my initial statement, additional hashing power is only added so the owner benefits with earning more coins.  But as the power is added, difficulty increases, so the benefit of mining is reduced.  Individually, the owner of the new mining equipment will gain some extra coins, but at the expense of someone else, who hasn\'t upgraded, and their rig is now providing a smaller percentage to the network.

If you simply run the printing press the money will very soon become worthless.\n\nMoney creation actually involves the act of destroying value from the existing economy and then, in turn, creating new money of corresponding equal value. This transfers the value from the economy to the new money and is the magical moment that represents money creation.\n\nTake a central bank like the Bank of England, for instance. To create new money it doesn\'t just run the printing press and/or type in a bunch of numbers into one of its member banks\' account. In itself that wouldn\'t represent money creation. The money creation moment is achieved when the BoE buys existing financial assets with the newly "printed" money. Put simply, they remove some existing value from the economy and exchange it for new monetary tokens, thereby magically engendering these tokens with value equivalent to the financial assets that have been removed from circulation. \n\nTake the more ancient process of coin minting if you prefer. Metal ore is removed from the economic system and is no longer available for use in the production of jewelry and such -- it ceases to be useful as metal per se and instead becomes valuable now as money. That economic value that once was present in its use as ore is in an instant converted into a corresponding value as money. \n\nWhen we say that money is backed by something, the true meaning of that is not that the money is convertible into its underlying asset upon demand. The true meaning is simply that upon creation its value came from the disappearance of value of whatever backed it. The pound is created by removing bonds from circulation, it is backed by those bonds. But you can\'t exchange your money for those bonds on demand, nor do those bonds safeguard the value of the currency against complete collapse since those bonds are denominated in the very same currency that would be under collapse.\n\nThe critical thing is not the convertibility of a money into some other valuable, the critical thing is that when that money was created it attained its value not just from people spontaneously declaring it to have value, but by deriving that value from some other valuable which was "destroyed" in the process, or more accurately had its value "transferred" to the newly created money. \n\nThis is precisely what mining does for bitcoin. New bitcoins are created with value because value is destroyed in the form of electricity in the act of their creation, that value is transferred to the value of the newly created coins. Money creation must always have some underlying exchange of value, the fact that this particular form of exchange has negative consequences for the environment is a problem with our current methods for generating electricity, not a problem with bitcoin per se. \n\nMany people have this false notion of money creation as simply a matter of creating new tokens. This is where the whole notion of bitcoin as "monopoly money" comes from. I fear some alt-coins that issue currencies without backing that currency (i.e., destroy some existing value in the process) are going to be in for a rude awakening. \n\nSo, if there is one thing that is true about bitcoin, it is most definitely NOT that mining is a liability upon the system. Just the opposite, it is a glowing asset and one of the miracles of the system.

I was particularly interested in exploring how the idea of central bank independence (CBI), itself created during a time of high inflation which was presumed to be the fault of pernicious, short-sighted politicians, carried over to today\'s post-2008 near-zero interest rate environment. Anyway, as part of that, I had to learn the history of central banking, and the first two central banks were the Bank of England and the Swedish Riksbank. People argue about which one is "oldest" because the Riksbank was suspended for a few years later on and therefore might be said to not be continuously functioning, but they were created around the same time to fund the wars of England in France and the Swedes against Denmark, respectively.\n\nFor sources, one of the best books on banking and financial history I\'ve ever encountered is [Fragile by Design](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00GMSUUVS?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_search_detailpage). If you\'re not willing to read an entire book, the [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_England) on the BoE includes that the bank was originally founded to fund the rebuilding of the English navy. And the [Riksbank](http://www.riksbank.se/en/The-Riksbank/History/Money-and-power-the-history-of-Sveriges-Riksbank/Caroline-years/) history site includes a snippet about how the Riksbank was forced to finance the Great Northern War.\n\nThe Fed, as you mentioned, was not created to fund a war. It was forced to supply below-market rate loans to the federal government during WWI and WWII, but it was not explicitly founded to fight a war. But the Fed isn\'t the world\'s first central bank. Fragile by Design helps explain why the Fed was designed to be a lender of last resort, whereas the BoE had that role forced upon it by public outrage over several decades in the 1830s-1860s. Central banks have never had a static or limited role in society. Like any other institution - and I think that\'s how they are best understood, as government institutions - they evolve and change with the times. The Fed started as a lender of last resort, then expanded to macro stability, then shrank to simple inflation targeting, then expanded back to macro stability and (as of Dodd-Frank) system-wide regulation. The BoE started to fund wars, then grew to be a lender of last resort, then got nationalized to pay for the war effort and only regained its freedom in 1997 as part of a "get monetary policy out of the hands of politicians" CBI mindset.

Hope you guys work on that someday.": 1, 'I want to use multi sig because I feel somewhat safer if my key is managed by a service. Just like for maximum security, you should probably run your own VPN, your own email server, etc, but does everyone have the technical know how? And what happens when your HD crashes? Did you setup a proper backup service? Offsite backup? These are things that you know Google has thought through and stakes its reputation on when it runs a global email service like Gmail for instance. There are companies that use Google Apps and therefore Google makes every effort to make sure you get great uptime and your data is secure.\n\nSo similarly, with Bitcoin, there are many ways to manage keys, but I\'m still most comfortable having a service take care of the details of sending and receiving, change addresses and what not. While I could probably use a paper wallet and effectively and securely store funds, i\'d probably end up importing it into Blockchain.info when it comes to spending and what not just because there\'s high risk in messing up change addresses unless you\'re careful.\n\nWhy Multi-Sig? Because there have been so many Bitcoin heists where "wallet services" run off with your funds. That\'s why people are wary of even companies like Circle and Coinbase. Coinbase\'s Multisig for instance allows you to trust them with managing the sending/receiving, but ensures that they cannot run off with your money.\n\nAs for the different multi sig methods, it\'s just how Copay works. When you start a multi-sig wallet (take 2 of 3 for example), you need to have 2 other clients including the original one you created join in. For instance you could use your phone, computer, and tablet, but IMO that defeats the purpose of multi-sig if you\'re just using 3 of your devices. The other way is to give someone you trust with one of the keys, but at the end of the day you\'re just using 2 of your devices 99% of the time. And how good of a job is your best friend at keeping your 1 key safe? Unless my best friend is someone on /r/bitcoin or someone who\'s familiar with PGP encryption, I don\'t really have many options.\n\nNow if you run a business and your business partner needs to get involved perhaps Copay is a good solution. Also I understand that Copay never holds a key in their multisig use, which is a positive for security but a downside in convenience. If you\'re flying solo and you just want to hold your funds securely with multisig, I\'d recommend Bitgo and Coinbase solutions.

Jaromil, welcome to the Keiser report! We started to talk about this issue in the Bitcoin space, about the block size. So tell us about the story behind the attempt to change the block size. What is a block, first of all. What\'s the issue? Who are the real players?\n>\n> Jaromil: There\'s a lot going on in the Bitcoin community. I think this can be classified as the first real political affair that actually involves miners, developers and users of Bitcoin. So first of all the block is where all transactions actually get boxed, let\'s say. So it contains the transactions that go on the network just to make it short. And the size of the block is becoming too small because of the enormous popularization of Bitcoin. Worldwide, we are in a moment where we can only process up to 2-3 transactions every second. So the size needs to be increased if we want to use Bitcoin as a means of global transactions. There was also an attack that demonstrated to this effect that the size is not sufficient. An organization here in Europe, CoinWallet.eu, drove an attack that was basically a DDoS for the whole Bitcoin network.\n>\n> Max Keiser: OK, let me jump in right there so we don\'t get too far ahead of ourselves. You mentioned a couple points I wanted to reiterate here. You think this is the first instance in the history of Bitcoin, going back to 2009, of an actual political or politicalization of the players within Bitcoin. You\'re also saying that there was an attack on Bitcoin, it was-\n>\n> Jaromil: Demonstrative.\n>\n> Max Keiser: - swamped with a lot of transactions apparently by one group that is supporting one version of this block size debate and you likened it to a DDoS attack. So, do you feel this group that was behind this attack with this mass number of transactions, that they were politically motivated and they have an agenda?\n>\n> Jaromil: No, their agenda was purely technical. There is a technical agenda that splits the community. **Whether Bitcoin should be a FinTech sort of device for processing transactions worldwide, or if it should be really an asset** - a sort of project on its own on which we can run perhaps sidechains, or smart contracts in the future, but is not exactly the means for routing all transactions. **Personally, I\'m for the latter. But there is a lot of FinTech investment actually, it\'s blowing up because they see Bitcoin as a means of transactions. I think that will fail**, and personally I think what happened also to the block size debate demonstrates this. The people are not really keen to see Bitcoin growing at the pace at which the FinTech industry wants it to grow. And, the insertion of voting on the blockchain was the real political event that I think should be chastised. **Basically, there was a proposal to increase the blocksize that was pretty undemocratic. It was put forward by two leaders that lost the trust of the community and their efforts were immediately amplified by the media.** Then there was another proposal, BIP100, which is about voting on the blockchain so that miners can actually vote what they want as the block size.\n>\n> Max Keiser: What do you think of banks pushing for blockchains without the Bitcoin?\n>\n> Jaromil: I think it\'s a little bit hilarious. Of course it\'s part of the process of Bitcoin going a little bit mainstream, but I must say they\'re not fully adding any real insight. They\'re not really showing themselves to be very intelligent people right now. I mean, the development of Bitcoin goes on in another sort of context and it\'s very aware of what is the progress brought. And many banks jumped in with this huge funding for FinTech research of this blockchain thing. Just as if it would be like the ecstacy pill they take at this party that was getting a little bit too boring and they were a little bit too obnoxious and they were failing in many regards, and so they\'re trying to pump up all this enthusiasm into the last phase of their successful party life.\n>\n> Max Keiser: The idea here is that banks are coming to this with a centralized cryptocurrency which of course goes completely against the idea of having a decentralized cryptocurrency. The beauty of Bitcoin is that it\'s decentralized. There is no central authority. That\'s what gives it its strength and so banks are saying, "We love the idea of reducing our costs by 99%, but we hate the idea of losing control of money- issuance of money - debt, and by extension society at large. So we want to try to keep our control of society but drop our costs by 99%, and we\'re going to use blockchain technology". I would think that when the public gets a little bit more savvy in terms of what\'s going on, you would see a lot of money flow into the mother coin itself that being bitcoin. What do you think?\n>\n> Jaromil: I think if we start launching a new meme, like instead of blockchain, if we start talking about peer-to-peer ledgers and make it as sexy as blockchain has been, we would see a new wave of one-two years of investment, because they\'re hunting for these hypes, but they\'re desperately not understanding what they\'re dealing with. And I think Bitcoin can thrive as it is, it just needs a little bit of a remake on its leadership, because with this blockchain size change, there wasn\'t really a process of inclusion for every player. Some miners called for assignment by Jeff Garzik and from Mike Hearn, and I can second that feeling. They should take a step back and we should all give a big hand to Jeff Garzik for president in the new development team because he has demonstrated with BIP100 to actually comprehend the feelings of the community that doesn\'t want actually to be so conservative as keeping the block size down, but still wants to have a touch on its progress, not just like be driven by leaders that almost drive it on their own with this fork story and BitcoinXT, they just seem like they want to go on their own path. **That\'s not the way the Bitcoin community works.**': 1, 'good work': 1}, ('Video:Winklevoss Twins Launch Gemini Bitcoin Exchange', 24): {'Thanks for sharing!

I suspect this is the issue that BitPay is having. \n\nWhen a user creates a transaction and broadcasts it, the receiving company's system finds it and starts to track it based on the TXID. However, the attacker conducting the malleability attack sends out a new transaction which is exactly the same except that the TXID is slightly modified. If it is this second transaction, that your system isn't tracking, is the one that gets confirmed by the blockchain it can have some consequences.\n\nIf the system is tracking the transaction using the original TXID it will show the transaction as being unconfirmed, since the original transaction is the one that was rejected by the Blockchain.

It is not safe to spend utxo that have not been mined yet (0 confirmations)\n2. It is not safe to spend utxo that have been mined but risk a blockchain reorganization (can happen every block, for a couple of blocks)\n3. If you absolutely need to spend an utxo quickly, (like with 1 confirmation), you need to be sure that the inputs  ~~to that transaction~~ that provided the coins you\'re spending have enough confirmations.\n\nWhat do you (or your wallet service provider) need to do to protect yourself until transactions are provably non-malleable? (this has been said before, nothing new here)\n\n- Do check the amount of confirmations on inputs you\'re receiving from outside before considering a transaction valid.\n- Don\'t spend utxo without reasonable amounts of confirmations, not even from "change addresses". Having a "fifo" input selection in your wallet software (or manual like coin-control in Bitcoin Core) may help you with this.\n- Edit 2: Do be alert about split chaintips and be more cautious about what amount of confirmations is reasonable when such an event is happening.\n\nEdit: rephrased for clarity (i hope)\n': 2, 'I think the problem of instantly generating a universally confirmed association between a given Tx ID and the Tx itself - at the time of broadcasting it - would be a pretty hard problem for anyone to solve.
