The problem is that if the U.S. government was allowed to spy on everything, they can try to watch all of the network. And that\xe2\x80\x99s where it starts to break down.

[From documentation for Tails](https://github.com/freedomofpress/encryption-works/blob/master/encryption_works.md):\n>\n> A global passive adversary would be a person or an entity able to monitor at the same time the traffic between all the computers in a network. By studying, for example, the timing and volume patterns of the different communications across the network, it would be statistically possible to identify Tor circuits and thus matching Tor users and destination servers.\n\nIn short, no, you\'re not safe checking address balances or submitting BTC transactions using Tor alone. That is, if you\'re doing so currently thinking it\'s ok, you have a false sense of security.\n\nThe Tor Project has repeatedly stated Tor wasn\'t designed to be used against a global passive adversary. Turns out this is exactly what the NSA *is*.\n\nYou can\'t entrust your privacy to Tor, as unfortunate as it is - that\'s simply not enough to check your address balances privately.\n\nThe only way to defeat the NSA at its own game is to run a FULL NODE like Armory or Bitcoin Core.\n\n> You lose your privacy the day you need a third party like a largely connected LN node to make your transactions, since this LN node will have to abide to money transmitting laws.\n\nWhich is why it\'s important blockchain fees don\'t rise beyond $20.

The overarching goal was to create a peer-to-peer electronic cash system. That\'s the topic the white paper deals with almost exclusively. Satoshi wrote a lot about the concept. The idea of electronic cash is deeply embedded into Bitcoin.\n\nBut many other goals have been pursued at various times by various people. For example:\n\n- Brick-and-mortar transactions didn\'t get a lot of attention in Bitcoin\'s early days. The focus was on enabling online payments.\n- Script and the kinds of contracts they can enable, major innovations, weren\'t even mentioned in the white paper, nor did Satoshi write much about them publicly.\n- Tokenization of digital assets using the block chain was actually rejected by Satoshi when the idea was pitched in the form of what turned into Namecoin.\n- Using the block chain as a general-purpose timestamping mechanism only came up after Bitcoin had been in use for several months, and then only in passing.\n\nThe point is that these other uses only became possible after the electronic cash problem was solved. They weren\'t part of the original vision as expressed publicly. That doesn\'t, however, detract from their legitimacy.\n\nWhat I find less than helpful is when people go digging into old forum posts to find obscure quotes as support for a claim that this or that idea was part of Satoshi\'s original vision.\n\nThe original vision was simple, and clear: peer-to-peer electronic cash. The rest are innovations built on that original vision.': 5, 'Block size is simply a technical issue rather than a part of the vision. It is a bad idea to be fixated on particular decisions which were made in the past, but it makes sense to check whether we are on the right path.\n\nSo what we know that Satoshi was a pragmatic person, he understood that Bitcoin needs some time to grow and is not ready for some challenges. For example, when people wanted to use Bitcoin to organize a fundraiser for Assange, he asked people not to do it as an attention of authorities could kill Bitcoin at a very early stage. And this approach have worked quite well so far.\n\nBut anyway, as for me personally, I see valid arguments on the both sides of the block size debate. I think the proper solution would be to find an algorithmic solution to the scalability problem (I doubt that cryptocurrency actually requires _global_ consensus), but if it is not available right now, we need to make decision. If arguments on the both sides are valid, then the difference is in preferences and assumptions. And so for me, personally, it is important what Satoshi thought about it, because I don\'t it\'s right to take into account only one\'s personal preferences when considering a decisions which affects a lot of people.\n\nI don\'t think that the opinion of the masses is important (\\*), I don\'t think that we should just ask some experts (how do we select them?), and certainly my own opinion is not particularly important, but it makes sense to ask the opinion of the guy who started it and defined the initial trajectory.\n\n\\*: You might say "let the users decide", but when we have a global project like Bitcoin, when we\'re deciding on the direction, we\'re also deciding for the future users. So imagine two outcomes are possible X and Y. And today a million people decide X. But, perhaps, if we decided Y, in future we\'d have a billion of people who prefer Y.': 3, '>I know of no other way (without compromising the peer-to-peer aspect) ever proposed to achieve them without using more scalable payment patterns than plain-old-transactions.\n\nMy takeaway is that higher layer systems like LN should not be considered any different than the current "wallet layer," in terms of describing Bitcoin\'s complete functionality.\n\nWhen viewed from that perspective, and considering your point quoted above, it\'s clear that the entire ecosystem must be taken into account when evaluating whether or not the project is still in line with Satoshi\'s original intent.\n\nAs always, thanks for the clarity.

All we have is the white paper and forum posts. Some things he wrote on were recurring themes, but others were more obscure and one-off.\n\nEdit: After thinking about it, maybe the source code itself should be considered a statement of project goals. Perhaps, but it\'s very hard to judge. The first release of Bitcoin contained a market of some kind (market.cpp), but I don\'t think anyone views Bitcoin\'s main goal as building an online marketplace. Interpreting the intent of source code can be difficult at best.\n\nThe only thing any of us who aren\'t Satoshi and don\'t have access to private communications with him can do is read what was written and try to conclude based on frequency and emphasis what was seen as most important.\n\nUltimately, his views don\'t matter though because the entire project has moved on in some ways that were very difficult to predict at the time. Which was the point I was trying to make.': 1, ">As it goes with all people, nobody knows everything not can foresee exactly how the future will unfold.\n\nBet you didn't see a typo coming in that sentence :)": 2, "For the record, you're one of the few who *has* been clear (even blunt) about your intentions, reasoning, etc. You've also helped put some of the challenges and arguments into perspective for me.\n\nAt the end of the day, I won't (can't) argue with the protocol and technological limitations you and others have identified -- although, I will argue with some that have merely been *theorized* -- and, I certainly understand and appreciate our need to maintain decentralization (p2p).\n\nDo you intend to maintain the *cash* aspect of Bitcoin without pushing that functionality to a higher layer, or are you fully convinced that doing so is our only option? ": 3, 'In a nutshell:\n\n>Perhaps when discussing how the Bitcoin software should be developed, we should assume the death of the author and move forward forging our own path?\n\nSatoshi can be usefully referenced when discussing things like the white paper, terminology, and initial project goals. The creator of a project always gets to name things and stake out the broad vision.\n\nBut to bring in Satoshi as has been done repeatedly during scalability discussions is worse than pointless. Appeal to authority is not only ineffective in persuading the technically competent, but it reveals intellectual weakness in those adopting the practice.': 7, 'No one I know working on the Bitcoin Core, at least, has such an intention-- to make Bitcoin not be a "cash" system as you suggest.\n\nYou should not confuse technical details about implementations-- the computational and architectural details-- with what facilities Bitcoin provides, especially when you are not a contributor to an implementation... and I do believe that is often what happens. (To be blunt, as you say you support!)\n\nTo the best of my ability to determine only if we take care to preserve that Bitcoin is "Peer-to-peer" can we also preserve that it is "Peer-to-peer Cash".  In that we can always amplify the cash like portions of the system (e.g. by improving throughput and fungibility) if the system is open and permissionless. But we cannot obviously achieve that on top of a centralized base (because they centralization can simply say no-- if no other reason). Doubly so since Bitcoin\'s (differential) competitive advantage is strongly in terms of it being censorship resistant sound money (incidentally, properties called out specifically in the early announcements of Bitcoin).\n': 9, '> Do you intend to maintain the cash aspect of Bitcoin\n\nI intend help not just maintaining but, hopefully, also _improving_ the cash aspects of Bitcoin through useful bitcoin protocol enhancements; e.g. improving the throughput, fungibility, and reliability (speed to confidence).\n\n> without pushing that functionality to a higher layer, or are you fully convinced that doing so is our only option?\n\nI think this is, to some extent, like asking if I intend to maintain some functionality without using C++11 features or quicksort.  The technical mechanisms are interesting only to the extent of what properties and experience they give to the users. It\'s critical to direct concerns to the actual delivered properties; otherwise they end up getting directed to the _names_ of the implementation tools ("our results should be correct! _quick_sort sounds risky!" as a strawman example of that)... or broken comparisons.  Like, is USD not cash just because the paper bills cannot be sent online at all?\n\nBitcoin is more than just the blockchain itself, it\'s the full ecosystem that makes bitcoin useful to people-- the wallets, and nodes, and addresses, coinjoins, and the payment protocol, ... Even highly visible things like bitcoin _addresses_ are never even directly used in the blockchain, nor should they be-- they\'re a wallet feature. Moving them from the wallet layer into the Blockchain would make the system worse-- less efficient and less general.\n\nWe should make improvements using the best tools possible to amplify Bitcoin\'s utility (including permissionless; and fitness for all money-like uses) for everyone, and add them to Bitcoin.  The technical implementation may (and should) use good software/protocol engineering practices like encapsulation and layering; and some things (like throughput beyond small multiples (e.g. 10x current); instant confirmation) I know of no other way (without compromising the peer-to-peer aspect) _ever_ proposed to achieve them without using more scalable payment patterns than plain-old-transactions.\n\n\n\n\n\n': 3, "Well, on the flipside, it might be hard to discern the vision of a project in areas that weren't a problem when Satoshi left. What is the vision for block size?": 2, 'You refer to the "initial project goals" as if they were abandoned some time ago.

In fact, that goal is exactly what\'s being abandoned in favor of changing Bitcoin into a large (or simply expensive) settlement protocol instead, while simultaneously pushing the cash functionality to a higher layer system.': 6, 'The problem with "the death" approach is that a project might he hijacked.\n\nLet\'s try to abstract Bitcoin out of it. Suppose some guy, let\'s call him Foo, started a project to improve math education. Like a software with interactive problem solving etc. Suppose it\'s really good, but somewhat unfinished, so can\'t yet adopted by schools. And also it has some interesting puzzles, mini-games which help with some math concepts.\n\nSuppose that Foo suddenly dies. The project can\'t be adopted as an education tool until it\'s finished. But a lot of people find the puzzles and mini-games very appealing. Potentially millions and millions of people would love to play this puzzles.\n\nSo some developers say: "Let\'s rip the mathy stuff out and leave only the games, make an iPad game out of it, it will be a major hit!". Suppose that without the math context games are worthless for education, but are quite entertaining. Is this OK?\n\nObviously, this would be a dick move, as it disrespects the original author and his intent. Yes, people _can_ do that (if the license allows that), but it\'s extremely disrespectful.\n\nThe right thing to do would be to finish it as a educational project and try to deploy it in practice. Maybe make iPad games too, if that doesn\'t have a negative impact on the educational goals.\n\nSo, I think, this is why people are asking what would Satoshi do. They respect Satoshi\'s original vision and would like to continue with that instead of hijacking the project.\n\nUnderstandably, more people can relate to Bitcoin as a replacement to credit cards because it\'s what they interact with daily. But this use might be, at least in the current context, antagonistic to Bitcoin as a super-decentralized, censorship-resistant digital gold, which is probably much less relevant to most people\'s daily lives. So the question is whether focusing on the former would be OK if it a big crowd hijacking the project because they could not understand the original intent.\n\nRespect is usually a good thing, as it overrides selfishness (which often leads to bad outcomes, cf. the tragedy of commons).

If people see there is a real non-speculative demand for Bitcoin that is not absolutely tied to it being decentralized, they will move to create centralized competition that benefits them and that people want because they don't value decentralization and they just want easy to use, low fee worldwide electronic money. To some degree we're already seeing that today but more real usage will just make that problem worse and worse": 1, 'I use normal payment methods - debit cards, credit cards, PayPal, etc - for 99.9% of payments too, but not sure that\'s relevant. \n\nCrucially we have unfettered access to a nearly free, completely unstoppable payment method where borders are irrelevant and (more often than not) we can avoid supplying all sorts of personal and payment information (that may later be stolen or leaked).  I may not use it much, and "most people" may not realise its importance, but it\'s there -- for me and for everyone else.  This is (and will always be) invaluable, much more so for people with no access to banking or where fees are very high or where they really do care about censorship.\n\nA couple of examples where Bitcoin has actually been useful for me:\n\n- Sending a few hundred dollars to a friend in the US (from the UK). I have done it a couple of times and sending money e.g. via PayPal is *hugely expensive* by comparison.  People give away enormous amounts of money to banks and payment processors each year simply because they need to send money abroad.  My friend has since set up a Coinbase account and it\'s now very easy and much cheaper.  She has also accepted a Bitcoin payment from someone else (she sells paintings), which was something of a revelation for her; an instant payment from an overseas buyer who was much happier not paying an extortionate conversion fee.\n\n- I ordered a temporary sub to a file hosting site.  Again, no fees for transacting in a different currency (choice was USD or bitcoins, obviously helped that I already had bitcoins) and, crucially, no need to provide reams of personal details or payment information.  For online orders with online delivery, paying in bitcoins *should be* a no brainer for people that have them -- and getting them is getting easier.  In the UK, Coinbase does instant credit card purchases of <\xc2\xa3100 (per day).\n\nI\'m really looking forward to OpenBazaar for the same reasons -- fee free (or nearly free) trading, with no borders.  eBay and PayPal together take an unreasonably large cut from every single eBay sale -- it need not be that way.  A successful OB could be cheaper for buyer and seller.\n\nAs a final point, I live in the UK and yet I maintain a balance of euro.  The reason is simply because I travel to Europe several times each year and it\'s not always worth swapping back and forth.  It makes me think a global currency could be an incredible thing.  I find myself actively checking out Bitcoin options wherever I go.  Take away the need to cash in/cash out, and Bitcoin can be very useful indeed (particularly as the price becomes more stable).  It\'s a chicken/egg problem, of course, but I think things will change.  Projects like Abra (https://www.goabra.com/) will help.\n\nThis is to say nothing of the myriad other uses for Bitcoin (i.e. beyond the currency aspect).  Bitcoin will continue to grow - in wildly different areas across many sectors - *simultaneously* and *globally*.\n\nAll these things make me think Bitcoin has long term utility and long term value (even if "most people don\'t care about censorship").\n\nJust my 2 satoshis.': 2, "Oh, one could go on forever with that.

People are not going to use something as a store of value with such obvious counterparty risk.

Bitcoin\'s fundamental appeal as a form of money is that, barring a cataclysmic shutdown of the entire Internet, there is no single entity or even group of entities which can interfere with the network.\n\nThe same applies to any alternative crypto started by Apple, Microsoft and Google. An ApMiGo Coin that was deployed by these companies would inevitably be regulated out of usefulness. There would be little practical difference between holding ApMiGo Coin and USD in a bank. Things like the DNMs, OpenBazaar, Augur, gambling, donations to Snowden, etc. would not be possible. Additionally, if such a coin were tied to the USD, there would be little incentive to hold it as a store of value over the long term, particularly with the deteriorating US fiscal situation.\n\nThe people focusing on mainstream adoption of bitcoin in the immediate future are, in my opinion, mistaken. Bitcoin will go mainstream, but only after it has proven its usefulness as a "hard money" that offers protection against a dysfunctional legacy financial system and furthermore develops more unique use cases that exist entirely outside the fiat system.

There were even some easy gateways to exchange Bitcoins for this currency, just hand over your ID and pay a small fee.\n\nOf course the die hards of Bitcoin would never accept this, but it would make the "mainstream" appeal much harder because Bitcoin\'s only real advantage in the face of direct competition will be that it is decentralized. \n\nLook at bitcoin.org, the selling points used are: "fast", "worldwide", "low fees". Those points are not a very high bar to reach for a centralized alternative, and that centralized alternative can then profit from their position without becoming all that uncompetitive with Bitcoin on a purely feature to feature basis.': 1, '> This is (and will always be) invaluable, much more so for people with no access to banking or where fees are very high or where they really do care about censorship.\n\n...and these are the people who actually *do* care, the ones who are living in opressive circumstances.  trouble is that many of them don\'t have access to the tech to use it, and once they do, they probably won\'t know how it works under the hood.
