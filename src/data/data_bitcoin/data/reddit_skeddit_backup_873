In the beginning, there will always be 0 demand for new innovations. For a market to grow (atleast in the beginning stages), you need to convince the whales to participate, not the consumers. Because the whales first realize the implications and once you have them onboard, they can create the demand where no demand exists by utilizing their own resources. It's less bottom up than people realize. \n\nFrom my own perspective, markets are basically a battleground with evolutionary forces at play. Competition drives out the weaker participants and the more efficient ones tend to survive. Bitcoin is the ultimate tool of trade. For that tool to be optimally used, you need people that are heavily engaged in trade and understand how trade works. That tends to be businesses and merchants. There's no better example of the superiority of bitcoin when you have businesses driving out other companies out of business, because they had a businessmodel based on bitcoin. Once that happens, bitcoin being adopted by consumers is only a matter of time. Because when the world of trade adopts bitcoin, there will be a very large group of advocates (companies, merchants) with actual resources behind bitcoin. In my mind, having these companies and merchants behind bitcoin and spreading its use will have more impact on the perception of bitcoin than trying to go directly to the consumer. Because they have the greater leverage. They tend to have more power in practice than regular consumers.\n\nMake no mistake, consumers are also important. And one day we will need products that succeed by word of mouth. By essentially going viral. Work does need to continue on these products. But we need b2b products as well. And I think the case is easier made there, because companies actually measure their own performance and can see the impact. If we compare companies and consumers, I think companies have better incentives to make use of bitcoin than consumers. Because companies are more immersed in the world of trade than consumers.

Let's say, hypothetically, the entirety of the rest of the budget was at exactly a $200 billion dollar deficit. Then the budget for the year would have a deficit of $0, yet the national debt would increase by $200 billion, because the federal government now owes social security fund $200 billion dollars extra.\n\nCurrently the federal government owes a lot of money to the social security fund (trillions). On the one hand, that means our total debt is *not* actually $17+ trillion, since we owe some of that money to ourselves. On the other hand, it does mean the federal government has completely raided the medicare/social security funds for all their worth, and indeed there isn't *real* money in these funds to cover deficits in the future.\n\nIf you look at when we were running surpluses in the late 90s, you'll see the national debt increased ever so slightly every year, even though we were taking in more money than we were spending.
