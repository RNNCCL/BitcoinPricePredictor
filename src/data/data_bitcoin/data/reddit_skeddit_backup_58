I\xe2\x80\x99d like to have a friendly conversation, but definitely address a few things.\n\n1.) Ted (Author of the article), you claim that in regards to Behind MLM that \xe2\x80\x9d in 90% of all cases their biased \xe2\x80\x93 false conclusion is the same: It\xe2\x80\x99s a pyramid, a ponzi or a recruitment scheme.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSurely you might give at least A FEW examples? I would be particularly interested to see ANY Onecoin information which they have presented which you (or OC) is able to refute? I would assume that OC affiliates could certainly point to one or more of such reference sources.\n\nThe first article (*Behind MLM) wrote on Onecoin in late 2014 has well over 1,200 comments on it now. Behind MLM has written about Onecoin discrepancies DOZENS of times. With sooooo many accusations, you should have no problem finding a few \xe2\x80\x9clies\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cfalse conclusions.\xe2\x80\x9d I challenge you to list just one or two.\n\n2.) you also state that, \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\xa6.A number of companies want to sue BehindMLM.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cWant to sue\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9chave sued\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9chave attempted to sue,\xe2\x80\x9d are an entirely different claim. A lawsuit can only be realized if there is proven defamation via misdirected slander and/ or libel.\n\n3.) IF Onecoin were so concerned about negative media pressure from Behind MLM, Cointelegraph (the #1 crypto and \xe2\x80\x98alt-coin\xe2\x80\x99 media source in the world) and so many others, why are they purposefully trying to deceive and make such scrutiny so easy?\n\nPLETHERA OF BAD EXAMPLES, *BAD ACTING (& history since inception):\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBetter than bitcoin\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 yet zero utility, no evidence of the technology behind it, whatsoever. *Like, \xe2\x80\x9cWe will be the next Google!\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 sheer words with no substance, by themselves.\n\nNigel Allan \xe2\x80\x93 first CEO, known ponzi criminal (so infamous Ruja had to get rid of him in Jan. last yr)\n\nSebastian Greenwood \xe2\x80\x93 Unaico, Site Talk, and other ponzi involvement\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cForbes Bulgaria cover and article\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 LIE, Paid Advert, only distribution to select OC affiliates\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFinancial IT cover and article (quarterly)\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 LIE, Paid Advert, only distribution to select OC affiliates\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOneWorld & SEVA Canada Partnership (for Blind Kids)\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 I investigated and disproved it, MYSELF. *No affiliation w/ SEVA\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cRuja is buying a number of banks\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 totally false\n\nACTUALLY, how many banks have they gone through in the past 8 months!?!?\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe sell educational material\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 plagiarised, out-of-date, available for cheap or free online. *Occam\xe2\x80\x99s Razor would suggest that, 10 to 1, what they are promoting are their ponzi points, not their education material.\n\nAND NO MATERIAL FOR MOST RECENT BIGGEST PACKAGES (*but will take money)\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBLOCKCHAIN\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 see definition of blockchain.

Whether that vision is based on #1, #2, or #3 described above is kind of irrelevant, but it highly likely involves all 3.  That\'s not conspiracy, that\'s just human psychology.

Miners need to be able to sell their coins, which means 75% of miners will only support a fork like Classic if they are extremely confident that the most economically important full nodes (exchanges) will also support Classic. And if miners and exchanges support a fork to classic, then the vast majority of the rest of the bitcoin ecosystem as well will for a variety of simple reasons:\nPeople want bitcoins that they can buy/sell on exchanges.\nPeople want bitcoins that have a confirmation time of less than an hour. If <25% of miners are mining a failed fork, the confirmation times balloon and difficulty won\'t reset for 2+ months.\nSo if a Classic fork happens, it means by definition that most miners and most economically important full nodes already support it, and that will bring with it support of the vast majority of bitcoin users.\n\nTLDR: If a classic fork happens, it by definition must mean that it has superconsensus support from the broad community, including miners and exchanges.': 1, '> You don\'t seem to understand what "consensus" means.\n\nNo, I\'m quite sure I do. Consensus-based protocols are nothing new. If nodes enforce different rules, they break consensus and fork onto a different network. \n\n> This is a basic misunderstanding. Miners need to be able to sell their coins, which means 75% of miners will only support a fork like Classic if they are extremely confident that the most economically important full nodes (exchanges) will also support Classic.\n\nFirstly, 75% miners being "extremely confident" doesn\'t mean they have complete information on which fork the userbase supports. Where they point their hash power is just a temporary condition. Nodes can be easily spun up, and not all nodes are reachable. And this idea that exchanges are all that matters is LOL. Like users, they only vote with their nodes, and have no control over which nodes the user base runs. \n\n> People want bitcoins that they can buy/sell on exchanges.\n\nAnd? If there are multiple surviving blockchains, exchanges could in theory deliver all of them, or even allow them to trade against each other. In a contentious split, two chains with incompatible rules would both still have a market cap and a market; it\'s just probably the case that their combined market cap will be lower than now, due to erosion of trust in the protocol\'s ability to enforce consensus rules.\n\nIn a contentious hard fork situation, exchanges that support the Classic fork put themselves in a precarious situation. Once inputs from newly minted coins on the Classic fork are sufficiently mixed with their inputs, coins will be tainted and unspendable on the original chain. In contrast, any exchange enforcing the original consensus rules ensures that any "bitcoins" they send their customers are spendable on the original network (and any other fork). In the former situation, they open themselves up to fraud lawsuits for delivering customers "bitcoins" which cannot be spent on the original (and functioning) bitcoin network. These would be interesting times indeed!\n\n> People want bitcoins that have a confirmation time of less than an hour.\n\nSure. You could always pay an adequate fee.

It won\'t be immediately clear during a fork, but a chain is only worthy if users are willing to accept the rules (and accordingly use the network). Hash power doesn\'t say anything about that. Oh, a majority of miners are "confident?" Well, let\'s see if they\'re right. I\'ll be running a Core node and not moving any coins. \n\nThere is already code ready for testing to immediately retarget difficulty in the case of a very significant drop in hash rate. One could easily perceive miners\' attempts to change the rules from under users that disagree as an attack -- a "75% attack" if you will. And this would be an appropriate and sufficient response.\n\n> So if a Classic fork happens, it means by definition that most miners and most economically important full nodes already support it\n\nIf 75% of miners are relaying blocks whose coinbase transactions inflate the supply beyond 21 million, surely I would fork them off, too. "Economically important" has no bearing on a p2p system. Peers call the shots because peers enforce the rules. Any miner or exchange can temporarily support any fork they want (even one that inflates the supply by some multiple) -- but they may very well make the wrong choice. And they will pay for it, to be sure.\n\n> TLDR: If a classic fork happens, it by definition must mean that it has superconsensus support from the broad community, including miners and exchanges.\n\nAh, so without any evidence about what the "broad community" wants, and using this made up "superconsensus" word, you have proven what, exactly? Nothing.\n\n': 3, 'LOL no.

But it turns out that other people are willing to take those loans - and in the EU, will to take negative rate bonds - because of a variety of factors:\n\n1. They're required to invest their money by pension fund rules; pension funds are among the biggest investors in the world. Also, in the same category, they might be required to invest only in AAA rated assets. Particularly in the depths of the crisis, only sovereign debt met that AAA rating while also being liquid enough to absorb large inflows of investor money without significantly moving the price.\n\n2. They anticipate deflation, so a euro today is worth more than a euro tomorrow. Hence a negative-rate bond is economically viable.\n\n3. Who knows why. Market fear? Patriotism? Coercion?\n\nYou've hit on a very interesting point though. Academia agreed with you for 30 years. 2008 proved them wrong, and honestly they're still trying to figure out why.": 1, '>a financial crisis caused by a real estate bubble which popped. However, unlike in the US and West, bad debts were not purged from the system.\n\nThe mortgages were not purged from the US system either, they were simply moved via the QE programs from the commercial banks balance sheets to that of the Fed in exchange for reserves.\n\n': 1, 'There\'s no way this qualifies as "great."

I don\'t know, and I bet *you don\'t either!* That means it\'s bullshit, meant to destroy our economy and **kill our puppies!** When will people *open their eyes?!* Here\'s a chart.\n\nThis analysis brought to you by zerohedge.': -1, "Who is buying all the new debt issued by the US government? It doesn't seem like such a good deal. Buying debt with with 1 or 2 percent return with the potential for the value of these bonds only to go down once rates are raised. It seems like it's a game of hot potato. What happens to these banks if they are stuck in a situation where they have to hold these bonds but the value plummets because there is crisis in which rates skyrocket. I think there is a chance of a potential crisis because this debt which is considered one of the safest assets in the world is really illiquid. ": 1, 'Yes, this is true. The same thing was attempted in Japan (hence my "innovative programs"). However, in Japan, they didn\'t move much of the debt to their new vehicle, and they didn\'t fund it very well either because a lot of the debt was denominated in foreign currencies.\n\nIn the US, they moved the debt to the Fed\'s balance sheet. This is worrisome, but not catastrophic, because the Fed has stated it intends to hold those instruments to maturity. So while a commercial bank might write off a non-performing mortgage after a year and send it to collections, the Fed can afford to just sit and wait until repayments begin. Obviously that won\'t happen for all of those loans, but the Fed has much more leeway than private banks do. \n\nAnd in the meantime, the losses the Fed incurs on those loans are more than made up by its other investments. Its stakes in major banks, acquired as part of the bailout agreements, have allowed it to remit a profit to Treasury for several years.\n\nSo, yes, they\'re not "gone", but they are pretty effectively quarantined. Japan never did that effectively. That\'s the biggest difference between the two approaches, in my opinion.\n\nIf you\'re interested in the Japanese situation, Gillian Tett\'s book on the subject is quite good.': 1, '> If you think you think bond market crash is not possible, you are kidding yourself. How is it possible they gained 30% in value since 2008? Bond prices always go up right, lol.\n\nBonds go up when interest rates go down. They are inversely correlated. Given the low interest rate environment, it is to be expected that bond prices have gone up - and it is inevitable that, eventually, they will come back down. Whether or not that causes a crash, who knows.': 1, "Make fun of the simplicity and hyperbolic nature of OP's article.": 1, "The Fed is in a such precarious position having to slowly raise rates without causing a selloff. The problem the secondary market dwarfs new issue so any panic in the market is going to cause a crash in bond prices. Is the Fed going to once again backstop the market if there is panic? Hey let's add another 30 trillion to the balance sheet, no problemo.\n\nAll it takes is a downtrend in bond prices and it all starts to go. Who really wants to hold an asset with a 1 percent yield that is losing value? Bonds could easily lose 40%-50% of their value and boy that 5% yield is going to be looking great right? /s \n\nIf you think you think bond market crash is not possible, you are kidding yourself.

Money is an abstraction and manipulating its time-value does not change economy. It's stupendously childish to imagine it could.": 2, 'Does your portfolio have any bond exposure?': 1, 'Japan is an interesting case study, in that they had a financial crisis caused by a real estate bubble which popped. However, unlike in the US and West, bad debts were not purged from the system, and the political ties to the financial entities making the loans ensured the creation of so-called "zombie banks" which were effectively dead in every way except they were propped up by government lending and assistance. We never quite got to that point in the West post-2008, but the comparison there is valid. Our banks got bailouts, but they weren\'t dependent forever on continued bailouts. \n\nJapan\'s continued stagnation is at least partially attributable to its insistence on propping up its dead banks. They did deploy several innovative solutions, but they didn\'t pursue the "helicopter money" approach for very long, and they didn\'t let the bad debt exit the system. That, combined with its peculiar demographics exacerbated by its traditionally anti-immigrant policies, meant that the prospects for recovery were dim.\n\nJapan is a useful case study, but it is not a direct analog for many other countries. If anything, its closest companion is China, which is also propping up bad loans because of political connections and is simultaneously facing a demographic crisis.\n\nSo, no, I wouldn\'t laugh Japan off. It is a useful comparison, but not a perfect one, at least not for the West.': 1, 'would you laugh this off too:\n\n...Doing what Japan did, except to a much greater (and much more fraudulent) degree didn\xe2\x80\x99t change the probability of the outcome at all.

(FYI academic papers can be quite accessible if you read only introductory sections and conclusions; there\'s no  need to read theorem proofs and things like that.)\n\nByzantine fault tolerance is distributed computing topic. There\'s a lot of material about it, but it\'s not particularly relevant for understanding Bitcoin. [State machine replication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_machine_replication) is a good overview on pre-Bitcoin approaches to distributed computing.\n\nCryptocurrency-specific topics such as PoW and PoS are closer to bleeding edge, and thus you might find significant disagreement between different authors. For example, Gregory Maxwell and Andrew Poelstra [have "proven"](https://download.wpsoftware.net/bitcoin/old-pos.pdf) that "Distributed Consensus from Proof of Stake is Impossible", yet there\'s a number of PoS-based alt-coins, as well as academic articles about PoS, etc.\n\nAnother controversial topic is selfish mining. Game-theoretic aspects of PoW are far from trivial, and there are some indications that Bitcoin is much less stable than people think it is. However, Bitcoin experts such as Gavin Andresen and Mike Hearn argue that these game-theoretic concerns are nearly irrelevant and we\'ll be better off focusing on high-level assumptions.': 1, 'http://www.coindesk.com/math-behind-bitcoin/\n': 1, 'http://gizmodo.com/whats-the-blockchain-and-why-does-bitcoin-depend-on-it-1698025216': 1, 'https://www.coursera.org/course/bitcointech\n\n+\n\nhttp://cdecker.github.io/btcresearch/ (esp. 2012 and later)\n': 2}, ('Buy Bitcoin in 37 countries with PayPal with Wirex/E-Coin', 25): {'Users are withdrawing funds to their bitcoin debit card from E-Coin/Wirex.

Lots of companies will gladly sell customer information.  Privacy is hard.  Anonymity might be impossible.

If they have reasonable suspicion then they can just seize your money, and then *you* have to prove that you obtained those legally. \n\nNo criminal charges may be pursued when they do this, but you still lose all your dough. It\'s some bullshit laws that they utilize to seize money in the "War on Drugs" and cash.\n\nSo the question is, can you sign a message using the Bitcoin Address that mined those Bitcoins.\n\nAlso this would work the same way with Cash as well. If you have a million dollars in your trunk worth of fiat, get pulled over, then you\'d be in the same position. They\'d seize the money using CAF and you would have to prove how you legally obtained this amount of money. In most scenarios, the amount seized is normally just a handful of thousand bucks. After an average citizen has his funds seized to the tune of a few thousand dollars, he\'s in a tight spot to even be able to hire efficient legal counsel that will fight to get his funds back.
