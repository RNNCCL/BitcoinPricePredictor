The key "holy shit" realization is the simple fact that an AI (or even any simple program) can own, spend, and receive money. Like seriously. Holy shit. A program can, today, own money in EXACTLY the same way people do. No exceptions. No legal cartwheels. No political debates. If a program can secure a private key and has access to the web, it can own and transfer wealth. \n\nAnd you don\'t even need to go all the way to highly advanced AI. Imagine a bitcoin-operated laundromat where each machine has it\'s own wallet to receive funds, which it uses to pay for it\'s water, electricity, maintenance, and "rent". At that point (barring legal issues) the machine might even be able to own itself. Maybe it even competes on price with other machines or pays a mover to take it to another laundromat that it can rent space in with promise of better pay. Provided the structure is there for the program to interact with the services it needs to consume, a relatively simple program could probably handle this. No AI. \n\nAnother good example is self owning cars, which Andreas explains here. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkO9hxVv4lU&feature=youtu.be&t=2089\n\nPoint is, bitcoin isn\'t food for AI. Electricity is. Bitcoin is money for AI, like bitcoin is money for Humans. It\'s an abstract unit of account that can be used to exchange things it produces for things it consumes. But, unlike traditional fiat, bitcoin won\'t take years of legal debate and political games for an AI to be recognized as a person who can hold a bank account. An AI can own bitcoin today, and there\'s really not much anyone can do to stop that.\n\nThis still blows my mind...': 15, "If you actually read about the real implications of a truly superintelligent AI popping up, the whole idea of them being able to obtain new hardware is actually quite prevalent, and the general view is that an AI that was even just as smart as the smartest human being, could easily social engineer itself into some money, and an AI that was, say, 5 times smarter than a human, could hack all sorts of systems to obtain money/equipment.

Indeed, it evolved from actual warfare: most early traders switched on the fly from merchants to pirates depending on how strong you seemed. In business there are certain rules describing how companies may and may not compete with one another, and someone deciding that they\'re going to play by their own rules is missing the point. Saying "I\'m not going to apply for patents just because everyone else does" is not like saying "I\'m not going to lie just because everyone else does."

Under the present rules, patents are part of the game.\n\n> We do advise the companies we fund to apply for patents, but not so they can sue competitors.

If it\'s about mining a block, and not publishing it immediately, then sure that could be practical. You can now try to mine one more block on top of your current, and have a chance to then publish two new mined blocks instead of one. If the first block is empty (no transactions) and you have good network presence, then you could watch all big pools and if someone else mines a block you immediately publish your smaller block. With some luck you still avoid getting it orphaned.\n\nMaybe interesting to look into those pools that mined 6 blocks in a row with no (or few?) transactions in them. It could be an example of this strategy in the wild.': 3, '>what is "block withholding" in this case? \n\nI link to a paper in [my earlier comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3lxa0e/how_does_the_math_work_that_a_miner_only_needs_to/cva62sg) that does a good job of explaining it.\n': 1, 'Any mining pool esp the larger ones have a head start (even tho currently small) when they find a block and start work on the next one while other miners are flushing their work queues. The issue is gonna get bigger when blocks break the 1MB size and could take longer to propagate through the network. ': 1, "If by withholding you get an advantage, the only thing that comes to mind would be transaction fees if you didn't already have a full block. Due to block size cap and high reward:fee it doesn't make much sense now, but could later.\n\nAnd I'm sure there are some ingenious ways to use manipulating blocks to affect future settlement systems.": 1, "I'd like to know this too, a had a quick look a while back but I didn't see any simple explanations.": 1, 'Yes, I saw it and had a quick read but didn\'t find the kind of "block withholding" I was thinking about. Still not sure what the OP was really asking to know more about. paging /u/keepcalmson': 1, 'A miner\'s profit is based on the percentage of blocks they mine, in the long term.  If they adopt a behavior that causes many blocks to be orphaned then that will cause the difficulty to drop (or to not rise as quickly if more mining power is being added to the network).  In the next difficulty the blocks will be back to 10 minutes each and the withholding pool will earn based on the percentage of blocks.\n\nWhen a miner finds a block they could immediately release it, trying to spread it as far and wide as fast as possible.  This is the expected behavior.  If everyone does this then each miner gets blocks in proportion to their mining share.  The other option is to withhold the block and start mining on the next one.  Then, as soon as someone else finds a block you release your block and race them.  You can set up a network that is well connected to tip the odds in your favor for which block will win the race.  As soon as one node finds a block it alerts all of the nodes in your network to push the withheld block immediately.  If set up well you may be able to propagate faster than the competing block.  If you find the next block then you withhold that as well.  When the rest of the network finds their block you push both of yours and automatically win the race.\n\nTo get to math, if you have 25% of the mining share then you have a 25% chance of automatically winning a race once you find a block.  If we say that you have a 50% chance of winning a race when you don\'t have an additional block then that means that you successfully orphan an enemy block an additional 37.5% of the time.  These two chances are mutually exclusive, so we can just add them to find that there is a 62.5% chance of destroying a block.  However, there\'s a 37.5% chance of destroying your own block.\n\nWe now look at the block production of both you and everyone else.  If there was no orphaning going on then you\'d make blocks at a rate of 0.25 N (where N is just a placeholder for the appropriate units and conversion; N = 6 blocks / hr but I\'m going to drop it for simplicity because ratios are all that matter).  Other miners get blocks at .75 N and that means that you get 0.25 / (0.25 + 0.75) = 25% of the blocks.\n\nWith the orphaning whenever you find a block (25% chance) there is a 62.5% chance of orphaning someone else\'s block and a 37.5% chance of orphaning your own block.  This means that you drop your own production to 0.25 - 0.25\\*0.375 = 0.15625, and you drop others\' production to 0.75 - 0.25 \\* 0.625 = 0.59375.  This gives you 20.8% of the blocks, so with this simple strategy it is not in your best interest to withhold blocks\xe2\x80\x94you lose your own block too often.  There may be additional levels to consider for how to handle the case where you mine two blocks in a row.\n\nI\'ve set up a quick spreadsheet to check other parameters and I\'ve found that if you can get a 70% win rate on races then you  destroy only 0.05625 of your own production but 0.19375 of others\' production, which winds up giving you 25.8% of the total production.  If you can get your nodes connected well enough to win races 70% of the time then block withholding is profitable at 25% total mining share.  If you can only win 50% of races then it is profitable to withhold blocks at 35% of the mining share.\n\n*******\n\nThere is another attack that I\'m aware of for "block withholding."  It involves trying to hurt an enemy pool by directing your mining power at that pool and getting paid for your work but then not sending them solved blocks when you find them.  I don\'t think this is the attack your\'e talking about, but I wanted to describe it just in case.\n\nThe nature of pool mining is that you cannot take a solved block that you find for a pool and keep it for yourself.  The mining reward transaction must be sent to the pool if your work is to be accepted and you cannot change that transaction once you\'ve solved a block.  However, there\'s no way to reliably tell that a small miner is withholding solved blocks because it looks identical to just being unlucky.\n\nWhen a miner does this they take rewards from the pool.  This is a method for running a pay-per-share pool out of business, and it may be used to make a pay-per-last-n-shares or a proportional pool look unattractive, since they will be consistently unlucky.\n\nI don\'t think there\'s a way to directly profit off of this attack, but it can be used to shut down competition. ': 3, 'According to [this paper](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1402.1718v5.pdf) 20% is about the maximum you could go without the attack being detectable by the pool operator as the standard deviation is estimated to be ~24%. So at 20% the block withholding can be attributed to variance and can not be said with certainty to be an attack.': 1, "> I've set up a quick spreadsheet\n\ncould you share?": 1}}, '09-21-2015': {('How much can a 330MH/S USB asic make on a low end PC?', 0): {"The miner he's talking about burns 0.06 KWh per day.

You can further delve deeper into who is doing so, to reveal more information and context from those peoples' feeds.

But enough of that, welcome to Reddit, and thanks for engaging with the community :).\n\nThis isn\'t an official AMA, but I guess also I\'ll also drop in some questions!\n\nPreface: \n> Decentralization is a very important characteristic of the bitcoin network, both in mining hashrate and in nodes.\n\n> We have about 20 mining entities right now, with the top 3 constituting ~50% of the hashrate; this is really subpar, as 3 entities can easily be targeted by governments looking to damage the network, or by regulators looking to regulate the network. Thus, ideally, there would be thousands (or more!) of miners, each equally distributing hashrate between themselves.\n\n> In terms of nodes, it\'s a bit better, as we have ~6,000. Here, too, while it\'s hard to pick a perfect number, the more nodes in existence, the better; if we want thousands of miners (let\'s say at least 10,000), then since nodes are less resource intensive, we can aim to ideally want an order of magnitude more, say 100,000 nodes.\n\n> Essentially, both mining entities and nodes must be maximized, to maximize decentralization, or else the bitcoin network will always be at risk of failing.\n\nQuestions (concerning decentralization):\n> 21 wants to "help build the software and hardware infrastructure for bitcoin" as a self-stated mission.\n\n> *Is one of 21\'s goals to aid in decentralization of the network, WRT mining and nodes? Is this why the 21 bitcoin computer incorporates a bitcoin full node, in addition to the mining component? In future iterations of the product, will mining and node functionality be maintained (even as price of the product drops)?*\n\n> *Can 21 commit to allowing the hashrate from its chips to be independently managed by its users, and not in aggregate left under the control of 21?*\n\n> If not, this will have the opposite effect on decentralization by potentially granting 21 a massive share of the hashrate, thereby making 21 an easy target of regulators looking to impose restrictions on the bitcoin network via bitcoin miners. Of course, at that point, it would represent a failure of Bitcoin and for all that it stands.\n\nThank you.': 3, "Andreas doesn't get shit, and died a while ago.

Taking my other post into consideration they could end up creating something akin to iTunes where consumers buy directly from artists, and then by trading satoshis to other fans are actually trading their rights of (consumer) ownership with other music fans. This would create a system where only one person would 'own' a specific copy of a specific piece of digital media, but would be able to give it away or even resell it at a later date, effectively giving up the ability to play the song, read the article etc... to an extent they would be recreating the old system that we had with physical cds, books, what have you, but in a digital world.
