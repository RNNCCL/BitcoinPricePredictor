The value of the 'underground economy' has been estimated between 500 Billion dollars in 2008 to 2 Trillion dollars in 2013 according to the most recent articles popping up on google search from my desktop. \n\nWhy did the 'underground economy' bloom from 500 Billion dollars in 2008 to 2 Trillion dollars in 2013? What happened to cause the herd to flee risking severe penalty if caught fleeing? I would suggest that when those who were assumed to be virtuous were suddenly unmasked, money saw the risk of being jailed for tax evasion as lower than the risk of keeping money 'in the system'.\n\nI would propose that a virtuous blockchain that reduces fraud allows people to lead more virtuous lives. I won't argue that bitcoin can be used for illicit transactions, so can a coin, so can a dollar bill - only one of those commerce vehicles is traceable on a time stamped tamper proof ledger.\n\nSo my prediction is that as bitcoin removes fraud from 'the system' the system will bring in those who've gone underground and that they would be happy to participate in a more virtuous tax collection system and more virtuous governance.\n\nThe benefits outweigh the risks.\n\nI believe that blockchains will introduce true wealth to the world initially through eliminating fraud and waste to such an extent that it will literally Change the World. I'd further predict that an end result is the perception of tax collection becoming voluntary - as anyone not wanting to pay taxes can simply 'unplug' from the system - with a content and wealthy and charitable world happy to care for those who would unplug.  If robots and blockchains are to take over programmable tasks, we might find that simply caring for each other and celebrating life are new careers.\n\nI am not against anything the author of this video says because it is exactly how I felt when I first learned of bitcoin being used as a currency and it took me till late 2012 to see it as something much more than just an underground currency so I give this video an upvote because I've been there.\n\nhttp://www.cnbc.com/id/100668336 est. 2 Trillion 2013\nhttp://www.ssc.wisc.edu/econ/archive/wp2011-1.pdf est 500 Billion 'tax gap' 2008\xef\xbb\xbf": 1, "Just FYI, I think she's deleting everyone's comments too.
