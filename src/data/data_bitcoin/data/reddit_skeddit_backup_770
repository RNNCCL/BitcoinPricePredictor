It remains to be seen whether this can be done, and if so, exactly what role it will play.\n\nMy overall point (why I replied to the original comment) is that it can make rational sense to believe that a future crypto-currency could do things that Bitcoin can't, and if those things enable more widespread use as a cash substitute, it could be a 'bigger threat' to cash than Bitcoin is.": 1, "Bitcoin's code doesn't determine how markets work, and anything with a fixed supply cannot be responsive to changes in demand. \n\nCurrencies always face changes in demand, and especially if they grow from being tiny, to being a significant player globally (which hopefully Bitcoin will).\n\nFixed supply is fundamental to Bitcoin, and that fundamentally leads to volatility.\n\nGold has a pretty big market cap, and is highly volatile.

I\'m no expert, but I\'d imagine most of the volatility in current currencies comes from trading for other currencies, as opposed to changes in the actual goods flowing around each economy.  There\'s some pretty crazy statistics about the amount of money on the Forex markets every day.  If Bitcoin is the only currency, it won\'t be really traded against other currencies (except a couple of tiny cryptos, as it is now) because it will have subsumed them all.  Also, if the entire world uses Bitcoin there will be a relatively constant and rather enormous demand for them, and the price changes will not be anywhere near the volatility of Bitcoin today, or even gold.

Also for more security look into [cold storage](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQ7a-WZzJas) and [paper wallets](https://www.bitaddress.org).  Also look into hardware wallets like [Trezor](https://www.buytrezor.com/) which keep your keys safe on an external device, but still allow you to spend from them.  [This](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.schildbach.wallet) wallet is pretty good for Android, and [bread wallet](http://app.breadwallet.com/) is good for i-phone.
