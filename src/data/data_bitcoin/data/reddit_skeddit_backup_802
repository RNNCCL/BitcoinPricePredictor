Whereas today\'s Bitcoin skeptic can point out that nobody spends Bitcoin on anything, a rise in Counterparty usage would signal loudly and clearly that BTC is a fuel for a decentralized Wall Street. Exchange cash for a stake in a company on your smartphone, and suddenly you aren\'t selling Bitcoin to people at all. You\'re just trying to match them with the right company, and "by the way a small number of Bits will be needed to fuel the transaction". This type of thing sidesteps most objections to Bitcoin in would-be investors. Like the Wolf of Wallstreet would say, you sell them Eastman Kodak first.\n\nBut you don\'t look at it that way. And I presume pitches related to Bitcoin 2.0 played an integral role in why Blockstream was able to raise $15,000,000. Their approach being, soft fork Bitcoin and experiment with a brand new security model 5 years into Bitcoin\'s existence. It is still unknown, for example, what the effects on concensus would be of a concerted attack on the main Bitcoin blockchain by a motivated adversary. You are fundamentally calling for Bitcoin 2.0 companies to abandon proven, simple and secure approaches and to trust instead in the security of your implementation.\n\nSince 40% of Bitcoin core developers have equity in Blockstream and commit access to Bitcoin Core\'s official source code, I\'m going to assume that sidechains are making it in regardless of how its security model stacks up to embedded consensus systems. Consider the fact that equity in Blockstream Co. ensures you will be on their side every step of the way. It\'s utterly astounding what a person can do when they have the tiniest financial stake in a company\'s success. It will cause you to turn a blind eye, when you see dollar signs, that combined with a good bit of confirmation bias will be absolutely blinding.\n\nWhat you are against is seeing real companies like Overstock "disproportionately" help a different oligarchy.

Doubling the money supply while doubling everyone\'s holdings simultaneously changes nothing in terms of the ledger, whether we\'re talking about bitcoins, fiat money, or gold. 1% of the ledger remains 1% of the ledger.

Other people might sell their bitcoins or their litecoins for the other, but it changes nothing for you because you retain 1% stake in both, meaning 1% of both market caps as well as 1% of the combined market cap. Only those who wish to speculate on the protocols stand to gain or lose. As a simple hodler you can relax no matter the outcome of the protocol battle. \n\nAs an investor you have lost nothing even if you take no action, and there is no one working to undermine your investment.

A spinoff is such that when bitcoin holders start trading, their choice is to opt-out (by selling off their free alt-protocol coins if they don\'t want them) or stay put and retain their same percentage of the market cap by default if the new protocol takes over. Rather than the situation heretofore wherein people have had to opt-in by buying up a similarly sized stake in every altcoin if they wanted to guard against a possible takeover of Bitcoin. \n\nPeter R\'s proposal recognizes the ledger (along with the issuance schedule) as primary, rather than the protocol used to update that ledger. Holders that don\'t want to be bothered with speculation on which protocol will win can retain their stake in the ledger no matter what. The Winkelvii\'s 1% of the money supply sitting in cold storage remains 1% of the money supply no matter which alt-protocol wins. It\'s very comforting for investors and long-term hodlers. While many people may switch to, say, Lite-protocol, and then suddenly switch back when that protocol fails spectacularly, that cold storage stake remains safe all the while.

As a result small miners would shut down or pool, thus harming Bitcoin.\n\nIn the pegged sidechains paper we solve this by pointing out that it's possible to delegate your daemon running for expensive to run sidechains to other parties (e.g. pools).

These non-bitcoins are then sent and received among those within this chain, but under the new rules created. Then when you want to pull your bitcoins our of the side chain you send a transaction to the chain which says you want bitcoins, the chain verifies you own the non-bitcoins, then signs a transaction from its bitcoin wallet to your bitcoin wallet. So there would always be a way to get out of the non-bitcoin assuming the network is up, if that network crashes then there could be issues. The pegging values means nothing because btc are simply relabeled to a number which makes transactions in that system easier to deal with.\n\n A system like this would require a way to make a private key shared by a blockchain which was created by the shared network and not any individual so the coins cannot be stolen, which can also sign transactions by using the network.

The same reasons that larger transaction volumes (e.g. larger blocks) imply centralization risks apply to sidechains.\n\nImagine verifying a block required receiving ten gigabytes of transaction data today, clearly only very large parties could afford to verify the data, so control of the block content would be in the hands of a very few.\n\nThe paper points this risk out, but also points out that you can delegate your transaction selection for sidechains to a third party (e.g. handing your vote to the EFF, or some pool) without delegating the bitcoin work you do, even in the case of merged mining.  This means that in a case where there were many or bloated sidechains, the centralization loss can be confined to the sidechain, and not impact people who aren't using it (except indirectly through ecosystem effects).\n": 4, "Thanks for the reference.

The alternative is requiring miners to choose between one and the other.\nSidechains can be merged-mined or not."': 1, 'other comments explained about it being possible to have both merge-mined and non-merge-mined side-chains, but about the cost question:\n\nthe extra cost to the miner is not hashrate, but primarily bandwidth to receive the other chain(s) to have the data to validate.  It depends on a chains parameters but if a chain were hypothetically to have a very large block size that could make it more difficult to receive the data to validate with ADSL/cable modem consumer connections.  basically data center bandwidth is far cheaper than consumer bandwidth.\n\nMerge mining is optional (eg you dont have to merge mine namecoin, though apparently 85% of people by hashrate do).  But when mining is close to commodity pricing, every source of revenue counts.  namecoin gives an additional 0.5% revenue from the NMC even though it has few fees as there are few transactions.  So one argument is it could become economically non-optional if mining is for profit (vs for the social good, or largely free as a house heater in winter).\n\nCurrently most pooled miners are actually letting the pool chose the block so they arent taking the bandwidth cost of running a full node.  Even if they are running a full node they are not making use of that typically.  That is an unnecessary source of centralisation that can be improved.\n\nBut it also shows that one can mine for profit without validating if there are a decentralised and trustworthy set of people to delegate validation to for people with low bandwidth.  There may also be ways to statistically verify the blockchain by sampling by a number of low bandwidth peers where 100 of them they each validate 1/50th part.\n\nSo from that perspective no one is forced to do anything though there is an economic dimension to choice also.  For reasoning about it keep in mind 5 things:\n\n1. voting (validation) and mining are separable tasks\n2. mining requires hashing equipment\n3. validation requires low-medium bandwidth\n4. voting decentralisation is important for bitcoin to retain its policy neutrality properties.\n5. mining decentralisation is also important.\n': 1, "Thanks for taking the time to clarify.\n\nTo answer your question, I came to the conclusion that merge-mining was required due to the fact it was mentioned while talking about potential drawbacks, mining centralization starting at line 343, section 4.3. I read the following paragraphs to mean that merge-mining is the best potential solution to the problem of validating several sidechains, but there is nothing there specifically that says that.\n\nI also read a couple articles that had worded it in a similar way. \n\nFrom CoinDesk: \n\n> According to the paper, the implementation of sidechains may require the need for merge mining, a process by which miners provide 'proof of work' to multiple coin networks, thus certifying transactions. Otherwise, miners would have to choose which chain to support, thus creating potential security headaches.\n\nhttp://www.coindesk.com/sidechains-white-paper-ecosystem-reboot/": 1, 'I read some good comments about the centralization, but I\'m still curious about the extra effort required for the PoW process. (EDIT: Reading and listening more, I think the "extra effort" is referring to the fact that the sidechains need to be manually picked up by the mining pools, it is not done automatically, but I\'m not sure.) \n\nThis made the centralization aspect a little clearer for me:\n\n> As I understand it, 51% attacks on sidechains as proposed by Adam Back have particularly devastating consequences because BTC can be stolen outright. So unless you negotiate explicit mining contracts with GHash.io and other huge centralized mining pools _before_ making a sidechain, the sidechain is constantly at risk of being attacked. Thus the whole mining centralization issue: sidechains require mining centralization explicitly. You can\'t proceed on a sidechain without first negotiating with GHash.': 2}, ("World's First Blockchain ID - LIVE Demonstration", 10): {'Warning - very bad joke at 15:00 :)': 2, 'Bravo, good sir.

I think 2 of 3 is the sweet spot for multi-sig. It has the best characteristics for creating new bitcoin address and for securely storing and spending BTC. One compromised machine does not compromise the funds. A password can be lost and the funds can still be recovered. If done correctly, off-site backups are created during wallet setup. The way to recover funds is known by more than one party. The balance of power created with a multi-sig wallet can be shifted by having one party control more keys than the other parties. If one person alone controls enough keys to use the wallet then it could be considered a Boss Account. When one party controls multiple keys there is a greater risk of those keys not remaining as multiple factors. A Boss Account also introduces a single point of failure, if the boss disappears, funds may not be recoverable. |\n| m=.5\\*n \xe2\x80\x94 Split Account | An interesting use case would be a 3 of 6 where one person holds 3 keys and 3 people each hold 1 key. In this way one person could control their own money, but the funds could still be recoverable even if the primary key holder were to disappear with all of his keys. As n increases, the level of trust in the secondary parties can decrease.

How short should they actually be? 60% of the loans on our platform are between 7 and 30 days, the next 30% are between 1 and 3 months. I wouldn't be able to give a better risk evaluation than what the market dictates and it seems that the market is comfortable with the current loan lengths.\n\n> You seem to be suggesting the short term loans usually have less volatility risk?  \n\nSorry for the confusion: I'm suggesting that the short term loans leads to shorter exposure to volatility risk, not to less volatility risk.  \n\n> Greed has no bounds! Don't mistake this for genuine market demand and need! Loaning Bitcoins is a horrible idea.  \n\nThat's the general argument against Bitcoin itself: people are just too greedy and they want to make easy money. However, I don't believe that's the case! None of the investors on our platform are out there to lose money and they take the appropriate steps to minimize their risk. We try to help them do that as well.  \n\n> Your website boasts 365% APR on the homepage. This is into predatory loan territory in my opinion.  \n\nThe [FDIC characterizes predatory lending](https://www.fdic.gov/news/news/financial/2007/fil07006a.html) as deceptive loan terms, charging higher fees than what the borrower qualifies for, stripping the borrower of equity, or placing the borrower in a lower credit rating to benefit the lenders, etc. Subsequently, the guidance issued to borrowers is that they should seek quotes from multiple lenders. Our platform is quite the opposite of predatory, it delivers the most fair lending the market can offer:   \n\n* The terms of the loan are extremely clear and they cannot be abused by the lenders, borrowers or us.  \n* A large number of lenders submit offers for each loan; most get between 10-30 offers, but some get over 100.  \n* The borrower can always reject individual offers or the entire loan.    \n* The borrower is not required to post equity as collateral.  \n\nWith regards to the average interest rate being 365% APR, that's only indicative of the types of loans people are able to fund. The reason such loans cannot be funded in the standard banking sector is not because they're so crazy, but because the banks don't find it profitable to analyze the risk associated with them. A bank would have to spend well over $1.5 million USD to educate its employees on what Bitcoin is and how to price the risk of Bitcoin loans. If the current amount of Bitcon loans people are seeking is only $1.5 million, then it would make very little financial sense for a bank to start funding those loans. Our lenders already understand how to asses the risk with Bitcoin related loans, so they're willing to fund them.  \n\n> Currently your site offers a great free roll opportunity. Take out a short term loan, sell the BTC for cash. 3 months later, if the price of Bitcoin has dropped, pay it back and start over.  \n\nWe have both USD and Bitcon denominated loans, so lenders and borrowers can take either side of the market, if all they're doing is speculating. So it doesn't matter which way Bitcoin happens to be going, the borrowers/lenders can hedge in both directions. Furthermore, your analysis seems to have a lot of assumptions which are conflict what we're actually observing: 60% of the loans are less than 30 days, another 30% are between 1 month and 3 months. We have no evidence to suggest that the borrowers are systematically misrepresenting their loans with the intend of simply speculating on the price. Of course, people can openly state that they're going to speculate on the Bitcoin price, but the market participants are then simply taking positions against each-other.  \n\n> And hell will freeze over before I donate money to a financial lending companies marketing drive. How audacious!  \n\nA number of people expressed interest in funding BLC operations (from dev to marketing) as part of the discussion in the Bitcoin Investment Group. There were many ideas discussed and the conclusion was that the we should do a marketing donation drive. The discussion took place in the private Facebook group for BIG, which is largely comprised of the lenders on our platform. It seems reasonable, to our customers and us, that we should be doing what our customers have requested... but perhaps I'm not understanding your criticism.\n\n \nKiril Gantchev  \nCEO of BitLendingClub": 1, '> Our lenders already understand how to asses the risk with Bitcoin related loans, so they\'re willing to fund them.\n\nThey don\'t, trust me!

What default rate would you expect?  It\'s a time bomb waiting to go off.\n\n> Our platform is quite the opposite of predatory, it delivers the most fair lending the market can offer\n\nYou got people borrowing $1,000 USD at 60% APR over a 30 day period.  That\'s massively over what most credit cards would charge.  These people are either a) not shopping around or b) not able to shop around because no sane credit company would lend to them.\n\n> The discussion took place in the private Facebook group for BIG, which is largely comprised of the lenders on our platform. It seems reasonable, to our customers and us, that we should be doing what our customers have requested... but perhaps I\'m not understanding your criticism.\n\nEither the marketing campaign is +EV for you in which case you self fund it, or it\'s not and you don\'t run it.  If people want to donate to you, it reflects far better on you to turn it down.  It looks really strange especially for a financial company with apparently nice margins.': 1, 'One of the popular loan types is the "LBC Trading", which indicates that borrowers have a local market opportunity to trade Bitcoin on LocalBitcoins and they use a loan to capitalize on it.': 1, 'yeah the only loan possibilities I would see that would actually make sense would be for shady things, or to be used for trading like you would on margin.': 2, 'I have used BTCJam for some months and I think given the time, effort and a bit of practice, you can earn decent interests with low risk. I love it! ': 3, "Im weary of lending bitcoin because of the volatility, which might make some people abandon ship and you don't get your investment back.

Wait for the next meaningful price rally and watch it go horribly wrong and cause some big problems and suffering for some people.": 2, '> They don\'t, trust me! Looking at some of the funded loans illustrates this point well.  \n\nThe investors have been quite active in weeding out scams and exposing fraud. When we first started the website we weren\'t sure how it\'s going to turn out, but for the past 6 months we\'ve been working closely with the investors. Our experience with them is that they are very proactive when it comes to protecting their investment and minimizing the risk of defaults.  \n\n> It doesn\'t matter if people aren\'t doing it yet... The opportunity to steal exists  \n\nThe opportunity to steal always exists, but proper due diligence reduces the risk quite drastically. The default rate on the website is about 4%, which is pretty much the same default rate as the fiat P2P lending sites (their default rates are close to 5%). So I can\'t speak about what could or couldn\'t happen, I can only tell you what is happening.  As I said, if we look at it from that perspective, Bitcoin shouldn\'t be happening either. Therefore we should consider the fact that efficient markets really do exists. If a product is good, then it will survive on the market... otherwise it will die off. The lenders, our investors and we are under the impression that our product is good and it will survive on the market.   \n\n> Please explain to me what you think will happen in the following scenario: Bitcoin goes from $350 to $1,000 over the course of 1 week and stays there  \n\nI\'m assuming that there will be defaults on certain loans, but that\'s a risk which both lenders and borrowers are willing to take. Subsequently, the lenders are charging a premium on the given risk and that causes the interest rates to be 365% APR.  \n\n> Ignore the USD loans. What default rate would you expect?   \n\nThat\'s hard to ignore, given that a fundamental part of the market is having the ability to hedge risk. USD loans provide the ability to hedge risk, so I\'m pretty hesitant to ignore that. I would expect a default rate not much different from the current one, simply because my view is that this is an efficient market and the volatility is already priced into the interest rates. In other words, people who wouldn\'t be able to afford a $350 to $1,000 jump in price wouldn\'t be able to handle a 350% APR either. Subsequently, the funds are currently being used for ventures which allow the borrowers to cover the given interest rate and the risk associated with a possible price jump. As the liquidity increases, we\'re expecting to see a decrease in market volatility. This will allow more risk-averse participants to join the lending platform.  \n\n> That\'s massively over what most credit cards would charge.  \n\nI hope we\'re able to come to a consensus here (not just because the FDIC has issued guidance): interest rate is not what determines if there is predatory lending or not. There are a number of factors which characterize predatory lending and they generally involve unfair, misleading or plain old abusive loan terms. Our platform not only provides the most fair loan terms and the most competitive interest rates that the market can offer, but nobody gets their house repossessed or knee-caps broken if they default. Despite that, there are real repercussions: if a borrower defaults, they may never be able to get another loan on BLC again.  \n\n> and I suspect some people are, what the hell is a "reputation loan?" some people are borrowing sucesfully on?   \n\nReputation loans have evolved over time. At this moment they have the following structure: each borrower is allowed only one reputation loan ever, the funds cannot be withdrawn, re-invested or used to pay off other loans. Their main purpose is to give the borrower an opportunity to demonstrate that they cover some minimum requirements with a substantially lower interest rate (lenders ask for as little as 1% interest on these loans):  \n\n* They understand how the platform works.  \n* Lenders can communicate with them.  \n* The borrower can acquire BTC outside of the platform in order to pay the interest.  \n\nAbout 20% of the loans on our system are from people in developing countries (Indonesia, India, Kenya, etc). There may be some cultural and language barriers which may prevent a borrower from successfully using our platform. Reputation loans are quite useful in filtering out people that might otherwise be good borrowers, but they don\'t fully understand how Bitcoin works or how our platform works (for the previously mentioned reasons).  \n\n> Either the marketing campaign is +EV for you in which case you self fund it, or it\'s not and you don\'t run it.  \n\nThe lenders understand that a marketing campaign benefits them as much as it benefits us. Both lenders and our platform only make money from the loan repayments. This makes our relationship with lenders quite unique: our interests are heavily aligned. So any increase in the number of qualified borrowers is going to be a positive net result for the lenders and BitLendingClub alike. We\'ve had a historically close relationship with the lenders and we work closely with each-other in order to succeed. This is also the reason why we decided to synergize in the marketing efforts as well. They have been ~~pressuring~~ asking us to provide them with ways to financially contribute to BLC and this was something that we agreed on as a community.': 1, "Except that some loans on BTCJam for example are pegged to dollars.

It's perfect for noobs who don't want to download the 25 GB blockchain just to receive bitcoin for example. However, SPV clients must query the balances of the addresses they contain. Electrum communicates with Electrum servers to confirm those balances before sending, because the blockchain isn't stored locally.\n\nWhat this means that it's theoretically possible for Electrum servers to learn a lot about your balances and transactions. This is where it gets blurry for me though. Supposedly, Electrum obfuscates that data with lots of other data, so the servers can't really tell what you're up to. I'm not sure how well it does that though, and one way to avoid the issue entirely is to use a full client. Another way could be to run your own Electrum server on a VPS or something, but I'm still looking into that.\n\nHope that helps.": 2, 'Coinbase is a broker, not a wallet.

Money is often simultaneously a store of value, medium of exchange, and unit of account. The argument goes that if a good is not useful as a unit of account then it is not money. However, the only necessary relation between these three functions is that a medium of exchange must also be a store of value. A thing can serve as a store of value without being a medium of exchange or a unit of account, and a thing can be a unit of account without being either of the other two. Konrad Graf has written an article developing this point.\n\n> There is no particular reason that Bitcoin\xe2\x80\x99s volatility, which makes it less useful as a unit of account, should impede its growth as a currency. It is still excellent as a store of value and a medium of exchange, which are good enough reasons to buy into it. Furthermore, there is nothing stopping a Bitcoin investor from doing business in Bitcoin and using national currencies like the dollar or Euro as a unit of account.\n\n> In the relatively near future, there may come a time when no real unit of account is available because Bitcoin will be growing at a rapid pace even as the other currencies are hyperinflating.

What you are describing as a soft fork is just a relay policy change.\n\nA soft fork is when the consensus rules change in a way that is compatible with old clients.\n\nIf a new client said some opcode could no longer be used, that would be a softfork. Old clients would still see every transaction without this opcode as valid, while new clients would see it as invalid. Because of this, we have to make sure no transactions with this opcode are in the blockchain (otherwise there would be a split in consensus or a disagreement about whether a block was valid). We can make sure the tallest chain doesn\'t have an invalid block in it with a supermajority of miners using the new client. The miners using the new client, won\'t put transactions breaking this new rule, of course.\n\nThe result of this is that while old clients don\'t recognize the change, they still use a blockchain with the rule applied and consensus isn\'t broken\n\nThese softforks can add features by saying a transaction using a certain opcode is only valid if it evaluates to true for old clients AND it evaluates to true using the new functionality. There are bitcoin Opcodes that do nothing. They could be given some functionality and the transaction would have to evaluate to true both when the opcode does nothing and when the opcode does something. This "something" can be sending to a sidechain and redeeming from a sidechain.': 1, "A common (especially among coins that have fast confirmation times) example of a soft-fork that occurs often enough would be a two miners finding blocks at the same time. Thus you could say that there are two sets of transactions that have 1 confirmation.

Eventually the 'reversed' transactions will be included in a later block, since they go back into the pile of unconfirmed transactions.": 1, "A fork happens when nodes running different software disagree on what is valid.\n\nA hard fork occurs when that disagreement is about what goes into a block, confirmed by a miner and written into the blockchain.\n\nA soft fork can occur when the disagreement is just about what types of transactions are considered valid by a peer, and therefore may or may not be broadcast to its own peers.\n\nSo when Core version 0.9 updated its minimum transaction fee, nodes running 0.8 might consider those Tx message invalid, and drop them from memory without passing them along to peers. However, those Tx messages are still allowed to be confirmed in blocks. That's a soft fork.\n\nIf the maximum blocksize changes, that's a hard fork because nodes that don't upgrade to the latest version of the protocol will consider entire blocks invalid, and live in a parallel universe of a different blockchain.\n\nPeter Todd demonstrated that a soft fork could be used to double-spend, although only one of those Tx's would ever be confirmed into a block.\n\nRegarding sidechains, something must be added to the Bitcoin protocol to allow side-chained coins to return. Most likely that will require a hard fork, because a new type of transaction or script command will be needed to make that return-peg work, and older incompatible software will consider those Tx types invalid, and reject blocks that contain them\n": 7, 'Thank you, your answer was very helpful. \n\n/u/changetip 420 bits': 7, 'This is not quite right.  You\'ve described a hard fork accurately, but not a soft fork.  Both a soft fork and a hard fork occur when there are different rules about what blocks are valid.  Nodes disagreeing on what transactions should be relayed before they\'re included in a block is not a fork at all\xe2\x80\x94you don\'t wind up with two competing sides of the blockchain at any point.  All nodes are free to choose whatever rules they\'d like when forwarding transactions and can freely disagree without any substantial problems. \n\nA hard fork occurs when something that used to be invalid becomes allowed (or, more generally, when backwards compatibility is broken, but this is the most common way), such as the change from Bitcoin Qt version 0.7.X to 0.8.0 (IIRC) when blocks over 250 kb became valid.  This change means that an older node is no longer going to stay synced to the network, assuming that the majority of people upgrade.  As soon as a block >250 kb is accepted into the main chain all of the miners who haven\'t upgraded get left behind.  Hard forks are resolved either by people downgrading to the older software (as happened in that case), or by everyone upgrading to the new software (as has happened in various altcoins).\n\nA soft fork, on the other hand, occurs when something that was valid becomes invalid.  In this case a node will not get left behind and is not required to update to maintain compatibility with the network unless they are mining (and even then it\'s not necessarily catastrophic for them to not upgrade).  An example of this would be introducing a new kind of transaction which appears to older nodes to be a "pay to anyone" transaction, but newer nodes see the stricter rules.  A non-mining, un-upgraded node will see that transaction come through in a block and will have no reason to reject the block like they would have with a hard fork.  They will continue to correctly identify the longest chain and will stay current with the state of the network.\n\nHard forks are an issue if any substantial minority of the miners do not upgrade, as they will be left behind and be vulnerable to double spends.  Soft forks are an issue if a majority of miners do not upgrade, as that will allow the un-upgraded miners to 51% the upgraded miners.  As long as over half of the miners upgrade in a soft fork the network will carry on just fine without issues.

And they could then end up extorting us with little recourse other than reverting or changing our currency or war.\n\nThat may not happen, but when you're adopting a new currency, you have to look at it from all angles. The US doesn't want bitcoin and will never adopt it on a massive scale, because it is vulnerable to other powers attempting to hi-jack it. There's also the problem of an increasing hash-size; every transaction is recorded and it all has to be copied onto every machine that's part of bitcoin.
