Adversarial thinking says they do.\n\n> I don\'t get this "centralization" argument.\n\nI\'d argue that when hardware at a certain efficiency is available for a while, it becomes easier for more diverse and smaller parties to get access to it. The new generation is rolled out to a few lucky (larger) players that have early access and others only receive it weeks, months later. So it starts relatively centralized and then trickles down to more and more players.\n\nIf that\'s even remotely true, it means every new generation of hardware sort of resets that process and the small players lose out again. That\'s been happening for very many times for a few years now: the next cycle happening mere months after the previous.\n\nSome big players have an advantage, small players get a kick in the butt.\n\n"Luckily" the rate of those cycles of smaller and faster chips is slowing down (to Moores law, instead of outpacing it), so there\'s a chance we\'ll be seeing more trickling down happening, where more and more players can again start mining.\n\nWe now (with AsicBoost) have a probably one-time ever opportunity to prevent one single cycle from happening, allowing existing miners to not throw away their investments and letting the trickling continue. Instead of once again resetting the whole mining industry.\n\nIn the long run, I doubt it will matter much, but in real life terms it means postponing throwing into the garbage dumps all currently existing mining hardware to replace it with AsicBoost hardware. Keep existing hardware running for maybe a year longer.\n\nWith all previous cycles we couldn\'t have done anything even if we wanted, likewise for most future cycles. AsicBoost is really unique in that we have a choice.

Someone calculated about $500 million was paid to miners in 2013, and that is based off of a mere fraction of the amount of money processed by the banks we\'re complaining about. Apples to apples, if Bitcoin processed the same dollar amount as the banks, what would be paid to miners? If the banks made $1.7 trillion on the equivalent of miner fees, that\'s about 3400 times what miners made in 2013 (according to the other poster). I would be surprised to find that the banks processed only 3400 times more transactions than Bitcoin that year; I\'m guessing it\'s much greater than that. So yes, with Bitcoin it\'s decentralizing  those fees, but as it is now the banks are the ones doing the "work" of running the network, so they get all the fees. I don\'t see this in particular as being an issue. \n\nAll in all, I love and support Bitcoin, but I think the fee argument is a non-issue, as it would appear Bitcoin is more expensive and disliking banks for keeping fees earned for a system they designed and run is just silly. \n\nEdit: This [article](http://www.creditcards.com/credit-card-news/credit-card-market-share-statistics-1264.php) states that in the US there was about $4 trillion of transaction volume by credit cards in 2014. The article in the OP is talking about revenue from all banking transaction processing worldwide, not just credit cards. It doesn\'t mention what the transaction volume was to create that fee revenue, but I would imagine we\'re talking about 10s to 100s of trillions of dollars, at least. As I said below in another comment, it\'s difficult to predict what Bitcoin would look like at the equivalent volume, but I don\'t think the result would be nearly as impressive if we looked at a 1-to-1 comparison. \n\nEdit 2: I read another article a little while ago suggesting that the total transaction value of all transactions the OP is talking about was approximately $630 trillion in 2014. The numbers following are rough estimates, so take them with a grain of salt. $1.7T is 0.27% of $630T. According to [this](https://blockchain.info/charts/cost-per-transaction-percent) chart the mining percentage of the value of transactions processed is roughly 2.3% over the last year (I\'m on mobile so I have limited access to specific historical data). This is approximately 850% greater than the fees charged by traditional payment processors.

It would not be possible if mining were more diffuse. \n\nAnd this is not even considering more subtle attacks where, for example, a hostile government simply keeps the pools under their thumbs to affect what transactions are included in the blocks, perhaps based on something like chainanchor or whatever.

I personally don't buy into all the conspiracy theories about Blockstream on one hand or Gavin Andreson on the other, but it is factually true that Blockstream can offer stock options, cash, or other incentives for miners to hold off on adoption of a disputed block size hard fork.

But then you just stop with "it works out to be quite modest" without justification or logic.\n\nHere, let\'s *actually* do the math on this.\n\nAny way you slice it, there must be an average of more than $1.5M worth of fresh Bitcoin demand entering the market, *every single day*, to support prices at this level. The past year\'s worth of bull-market is irrefutable indication that, on average, *more* than this level of demand is entering the market every day, which of course results in the price rising relative to the USD.\n\nNow, when M is cut in half (going from a needed **$1.6M per day** of fresh demand to sustain the price to only **$800k per day** to achieve the same effect), any positive price-pressure that results from a demand surplus is amplified. If we assume marginal demand merely stays *relatively close* to the levels Bitcoin has been seeing for the past 3 years, that\'s a minimum of $800k per day that needs to be satisfied with market buys (applying upward pressure on the price). \n\n\nThe only context in which the Bitcoin reward halving does *not* result in a dramatic upwards revaluation, therefore, would be one where demand (for whatever reason) significantly decreased around the same time as the halving occurs. If you want to argue that there will be a significant reduction in daily demand for Bitcoin in the next year or so, then it\'s reasonable to also posit that the halving doesn\'t result in a severe price increase.\n\n\nAnd don\'t forget, this is all *before* we take into account any positive feedback loops and/or self-fulfilling prophecies that result from the aforementioned phenomena.

Let\'s go a bit further.\n\nNow:  I1 = D1 - M1\nSoon:  I2 = D2 - M2\n\nHence, the change inflation I2-I1 = D2 - D1 - M2 + M1 = D2 - D1 + (M1)/2.  Since, we could both argue that demand will increase or that demand will decrease, let\'s assume that demand does not change (D2 = D1) due to halving.  Then the change in price inflation is simply half of the pre-halving monetary inflation, (M1)/2.\n\nI don\'t know the actual numbers, but let\'s suppose M1 = 6%/year.
