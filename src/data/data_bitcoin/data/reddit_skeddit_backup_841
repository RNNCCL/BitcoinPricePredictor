The description makes it plain that transfers can't be instant (*by design*).\n\n>It's important to note that ACH is not a real-time system. Rather, things are processed in batches at 6:30pm EST, 12:30am EST, and 3:00am EST. As a result, funds can take days to settle.\n\nWhat you're seeing is that the OFDI updates the account before the transfer has actually settled.\n\nWhile it would be technically possible for the Federal Reserve to speed up processing, it would be expensive to rewrite the existing (working) system. The standards organization that manages the ACH protocol is apparently working on same-day transfers, but it will take time for banks to update their systems to adopt it.\n\nPart 3 is particularly interesting because it outlines a 4-day transfer scenario.

For more details about this, read the full report here:\n\nhttps://s3.amazonaws.com/bitcoinarmory-media/CVEs/ArmoryCVE-2014-002.pdf\n\nArmory Tech has pretty thoroughly investigated the incident and believes that no action is needed by anyone, even if you have signed thousands of messages.

Every news agency was covering it and had a story, which perpetuated the run up in price itself. This was (and is) unsustainable.\n\nEventually, when the growth stopped, the same "investor"-types all started to leave. Some have held on, but ultimately, if they don\'t see a future higher price, they will leave at a different rate. It all depends on how stubborn they are as an investor. But eventually, if they don\'t see the price going up, they will all leave.\n\nWhat the "investor"-types don\'t understand is that Bitcoin, although designed to combat losses through government inflation and counterfeiting, is that it is meant to be a stable currency. This is stabilized by the demand for coins with demand for mining. Investors HATE stable. They don\'t make money buying a $600 Bitcoin and selling it 2 years later at $600.\n\nAnd so, the "investor"-type begins to cause ripples - panic, highs, and lows, mostly unintentionally, by their fear and greed. Volatility comes from them. And they all watch the prices fall, fear further fall, and cause other investors to make the price fall, and so on. Cascading rollercoaster ride.\n\nEventually, though, many of these "investors" give up. They leave the market place. The market stabilizes again. And normal growth continues at a normal pace again (based on higher adoption, and more people using it for long-term storage rather than investment). But these long-term holders won\'t jump in until they see a "stable" price.\n\nWhich brings me to the 2nd group of people, the mirror image of the "investor". There are "fundamentalists" who actually believe in Bitcoin\'s technology and usability. These people love what Bitcoin is, regardless of price. Some people think they are idiots, but they are foward-thinkers. They see the future and the benefit to Bitcoin. It\'s undeniable to them. They are not rocked by the heavy ocean tides. They are almost bulletproof to the degree that they are dissatisfied with the current financial system and world problems.\n\nUltimately the price will stabilize when the investors all leave and what remains are fundamentalists. And then, we can again begin the slope of steady growth.\n\nNot all the investors have left, so expect more bloodshed here on the price. The only way to prevent it at this point would be an artificial hype bubble perpetuated by the news outlets. But, given the recent memory of the $1000-crash it is unlikely that the hype news would be good anyways. It\'s much more likely that the hype would only crash it faster if they report on the crash.\n\nPersonally, I am OK with "investors" leaving. They don\'t contribute to Bitcoin as much. They waste everyone\'s time on the price and this is a time when we still need more focus on the technology rather than the price.\n\nBut there will always be investors, the greedy ones. And expect them to cause ripples (or tsunamis) and I simply steer clear of them. I don\'t jump in when I see a wave coming.

In addition to improved wallet software, I hope we start seeing more and more incentive for people to actually start using it. Still so much work to do.\n\nIndeed, I'm with you. I think it's interesting to look at the 'ease' and the 'use' though, it's sadly very poorly matched. I'll explain what I mean to anyone who can be bothered :p\n\nIn countries where bitcoin has marginal consumer benefits, acquiring bitcoin has become a lot easier, and there's a decent amount of technical awareness (computer-literate population, high internet penetration), bitcoin education (large English-based communities, documentation, journalism, software and guides), evangelizing on corporate media (CNN, Bloomberg etc). These markets are serviced quite comprehensively. I can send free SEPA transactions to multiple exchanges and buy bitcoin cheaply and quickly (Europe). In the US there has been Coinbase, now Circle.\n\nBut what are the main consumer benefits? The dollar is relatively stable. Card fees are relatively low and on the merchant side. Deposits are FDIC insured up to $250k. Payments online for consumers happen instantly, with fraud protections. Online and in stores payments are already relatively frictionless.\n\nUnless you count influence in monetary and foreign policy by disassociation from the federal banking system a consumer benefit, it's all pretty marginal. \n\nThen there's places where access to bitcoin is limited. These people receive 10% less on their remittance (which consist of huge chunks of the national economy. e.g. Nepal and Haiti's remittance shares of GDP are 25% and 20% respectively. \n\nM-Pesa, which is hailed as a huge breakthrough success, costs between 6% and 12% (2013) to send & receive any amount between $6 and $11 (very common). That's what a breakthrough success looks like. Billions are unbanked and have no access to basic financial services like safe storage of value, lending, cross-village/border money transfer etc. \n\nArgentina has defaulted on its debt seven times, it's insane. 600 currencies in history have failed, and multiple countries today face inflation over 15%. Argentina isn't even the worst at 39%, Sudan and Venezuela go up to 60%. These three alone with an average inflation of 45% represent 110 million individuals.\n\nBut most of these markets are partially or completely unserved by the current bitcoin ecosystem. So I think that's one of the leading issues we have right now. Bitcoin's looking pretty brilliant in the places where it's impact is pretty small, and it's almost non-existent in the places where it could have a huge impact.\n\nAnyway, I'm definitely looking forward to bitcoin black friday. If merchants really experience 2-3% fees and 1-2% fraud costs, and experience 30-day payments from their processor, I think it makes sense to structurally offer 1-5% discounts on bitcoin sales. Not as a promotion, just permanently. With thuisbezorgd we have this, the $1.25 in CC fees they charge aren't there for bitcoin, and as it's like the eBay for takeaway restaurants, saving $1.25 on a $10 pizza delivery is a significant cost saving, and they pass it along to the customer. I really hope we can do a November push to get merchants to understand and appreciate this en masse, and that Coinbase/Bitpay really push the conversation with their large merchants. At that point, combining Circle with structural discounts, we may see some momentum from mainstream consumers. Getting a 2% discount on a $1000 Macbook is worth considering. And beyond that, I really hope we can see some non-OECD countries get service. I'd love to see BitPesa's charts for 2014 in a few months, and I hope we'll get one for the Phillipines. They have an exchange, we have Circle, and it's a leading remittance corridor. Let's make that happen.\n\n\n": 2, "MintPAl are a discrace.

But we barely have any news on how much in processed daily by payment processors, Bitpay mentioned over $1m a day earlier this year. There's barely any data about daily active users for wallets, sales for merchants, company valuations.\n\nExchanges are probably the most transparent about their volume (because liquidity is a key selling point), but it's hard to estimate how much of reported volume is truthful, how much is trader/bot based, how many actual deposits are done (depositing 1 bitcoin, trading it a million times on a 0% fee exchange using a bot, is meaningless data).\n\nHive Wallet recently reported their downloads and installs, I really appreciate that and applaud them.

It's a tool like the internet, telephone, telegraph, pony express service, or stone tablets. If it doesn't adapt it will die out.

At that point, nations would take over the process of mining to defend themselves against the very possibility of the scenario you are describing. Mining not for profit, but for security. With enough nations doing this, mining remains decentralized.\n> The only way for a nation to defend itself from the possibility of a PoS 51% attack, on the other hand, is to make sure that the nation itself is the majority owner of the currency. But since only one nation can achieve this over any respective coin, each nation will be forced to construct their own coin and we are right back to the scenario we have today with fiat.\n\nThis is totally preposterous and based off nothing other than wishful thinking. Once again this goes back to immortal deification of a technology and it\'s delusional at best. To think we\'ll arrive at a point where Bitcoin becomes subsidized or managed by the government before a more efficient system takes the place is some serious technology worship. I know i\'m in the lions den wagging a stick at the big cats, but the level of worship around here goes against every example of technology lifespans we can look at. You don\'t like the way the government lets the Fed run our monetary policy but you want the government to get its hands in propping up Bitcoin? That would never happen without some serious structural changes to the point it wouldn\'t even look like Bitcoin anymore. You would be lucky if it even got close to ending up that way.\n\nAnd to your second point - people don\'t want to manage their everyday money like futures contracts. What if I could simply NOT press a button and receive the same result? There are other solutions which provide that service already. The old rules still apply to how people want to use it. This is why Windows 10 will have the start button/Windows button back in the software. Nobody gave a damn about the new interface. They wanted the old one because it\'s what they knew and it worked. Trying to add all these convoluted layers on top of Bitcoin for the average consumer to deal with just goes to show the inflexibility of the design. You\'re saying that it\'s not trying to be money, but then saying "what if we could make it just as good as money with this stuff added". This is some of the most ridiculous doublespeak. Credit/debit cards are more common than checks now because they were easier to use for the average person. Not because people were enamored with this amazing piece of magic plastic money.\n\nIt\'s the first snowflake to fall during winter in the desert. It has people amused and intrigued. Other snowflakes are falling, and to assume that everyone will stay in love with this snowflake (to the point that the government is going to step in and save it even) is amusing to me.

But without the 'sexy' volatility I would not have put the time in to learn about it.": 1, "Well the problem is volatility will be the ongoing story with Bitcoin. It's not going to stop. We don't keep stocks in our wallet for day to day purchases, and Bitcoin is closer to a stock than a currency. Though to get broader usage it's advertised as a currency. This will never last, and they won't convert the average consumer. The biggest headlines the average person remembers are the bad ones (mt gox, price crashes), and that will compel them to stay away. If you want to check out something new I'm from the /r/NuBits team and we have the worlds first stable value crypto. It's designed to be used as a currency first. We hope it will solve a lot of the problems Bitcoin is struggling with right now.": -1, "NuBits is actually not a PoS coin. It's not used to secure the network. It's meant to be truly used as a currency rather than a vehicle for speculation. It's not even closely mirroring the bitshares implementation.\n\nBitcoin is rapidly heading towards centralization every day with the case of mining farms controlling the security and and capability of the network. It introduces it's own interesting problems especially visible in times like this. As the process of securing the network becomes more reliant on farming it requires those farms to benefit from the process. They have no affinity to the network other than meeting their costs, and profiting (otherwise why go through the trouble, right?). Bitcoin has some juice to squeeze out of it left but it will get to a point where there wont be as much juice to squeeze. These price fluctuations can render operations unprofitable and with no affinity to the network other than profit there's no need to continue operation. When the mining farms shut down, so does Bitcoin, and mining farms are becoming the standard rather than an extraordinary circumstance. You don't see fancy logos or marketing when you look at pictures of these places. They don't love the coin, they love the money. There's a dangerous uncertainty regarding the capability of the networks future. Freedom is a double edge sword and the blade you use to cut others can cut you as well. Or at least in the case of Bitcoin just cash and and hit the power switch.\n\nPoS coins don't have that same unfavorable endgame scenario to worry about. It does have it's own concerns, but I think the outlook is far more favorable. As someone who hodls Bitcoins I'm not interested in seeing days like today, but ignoring the realities of the system is a dangerous game. It requires an ever increasing appreciation in value for the passive interest (profiteering) of securing the network. We have not seen anywhere near the same value appreciation since gox was fudging numbers.\n\nI'm a huge fan of the project i'm working on obviously. We've abstracted the volatility and ownership of the network (through NuShares) with the stability and utility of a currency (with NuBits). To believe that people would rather use a currency that can drop $150 per unit in one day as their day to day store of value, to me, is fallacious. Everything is capable of being replaced. Bitcoin is trying to advertise itself as a kitchen knife with a kitchen sink attached to it. It's impractical for the average consumer the way it's designed, but separating the components can produce some great utility.\n\nI'm still not sure how they're going to abstract the different utilities in a way that won't kill the network yet appeals to an average consumer.": 1, "But who was marketing it?

Bitcoin separates control over the currency from ownership of the currency, and this fundamentally makes it a tool for freedom. Pegged coins will be great, but they won't replace Bitcoin. \n": 2, "I don't think you understand my point. Even if Bitcoin mining centralization occurs, possessing majority hashing power is separate from possessing majority of the currency. Mining does not have to be done for profit, it's motive can be to gain control of the network, or to prevent someone else from gaining control.\n\nReal power is in controlling a currency, not in merely possessing the units of that currency. The Federal Reserve's power comes from controlling the currency, the amount of money they make is secondary for an institution that can print any amount of money into existence that they want on a whim. The same power is of grave concern when it comes to cryptocurrencies. People are thinking short term when they pump PoS, they aren't thinking bigger picture. The bigger picture is that once someone achieves majority control over the units of currency in a PoS, they forever control the system itself, they become the Central Bank of the system. This isn't true of Bitcoin. Even if someone gains temporary control, that control can easily be displaced by the rest of the network simply gaining more hashing power. With PoS, you can never wrestle control away from the owner of the network. When crypto gets to the level of nation states, either we are going to get Federal Reserve coin, or we are going to get Bitcoin. \n\nI definitely believe there is a vital role for pegged coins, I don't know how that will play out, but I think it is a mistake to think that volatility is a problem with crypto. Crypto isn't money, it is larger than money. And there will be a function for a variety of cryptocurrencies with different underlying strengths and functions. \n\nSorry if this post feels hurried, I have to run. \n": 1, "I had one friend tell me 'Bitcoin?

Hardware Backdoor's are real and more prevalent than you can imagine. The only way to be sure you aren't susceptible is to design and build your own CPU and computer system. Fabricating your own silicon chips is a surprisingly simple process, as all you really need is some sand.\n\n* Once you've hand manufactured your CPU, Motherboard, RAM, and IO devices, you'll need to write a C compiler that will compile down to your CPU's native language. Writing your own compiler will keep you safe from the Ken Thompson Hack.\n\n* Create a simple OS that you can use to access the internet. Some people might suggest using Linux, but there are 9,868,933 lines of code in just the Kernel, most of which you won't need, and personally verifying every line for rootkits might take a bit longer than you have the patience for.\n\n* Create your own bitcoin client. Satoshi's client could possess hidden back doors, or they could have been introduced since his departure. The classic create-a-currency-to-compromise-a-users-computer-attack is devastating, and we can't rule Satoshi out. Bottom line is that you cannot be sure.\n\n*  Dig a very deep hole into the earth, and surround it with at least three feet of re-enforced concrete. Place your custom PC in there. Thermal imaging attacks can easily penetrate the walls of your home, and reveal your private keys to any wayward onlooker, or high tech peeping tom. A sufficiently deep hole will also protect you against common keystroke sound vibration attacks. Also, if you've had any help so far, this hole will double as their grave. Loose ends are security holes.\n\n* Before generating your public private key pair, carefully run your hands over your head to ensure that you don't have any suspicious electrodes attached to your skull. Mind Reading technology is real.\n\n* Once your wallet is setup, Quantum Encrypt it so that any attempts to access it will immediately destroy the information.\n\n* This is the most important: Never leave your re-enforced hole in the ground. Leaving your hole makes you susceptible to the highly effective (despite what Bill O'Reilly would have you believe) water-boarding-private-key-extraction-attack.\n\nSource: [A long time computer security expert](http://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1e4b9s/the_only_truly_secure_way_to_use_bitcoin_from_a/).\n": 6, "Large amounts of btc should be stored anywhere *but* blockchain info.\n\nSeriously and most importantly, learn about paper wallets and move your savings there.
