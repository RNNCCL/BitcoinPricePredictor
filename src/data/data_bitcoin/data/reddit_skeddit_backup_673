For me personally- having to create an account with anything is a hassle; yet another thing that may send me email, yet another password, etc.  So I only create accounts for things I\'m really interested in using, I don\'t just sign up for stuff that I think I might use at some point, because then I get a ton of useless email.\n\nNow let\'s say you\'re a cam site (for example, no idea what your user acquisition process is like).

I click that, and I see two things:  a QR code (BTC link for 50c worth payment request), and a "guest chat name" box to type in a username.  Below the QR code are buttons to fill up my tip wallet as I come in- $0 $1 $5 $10 $20 (which change the QR code\'s request amt).  I type in a name, click $0, pay the 50c, and I\'m in as Guest-$nameichose.  10c goes to the performer, 15c goes to you, the rest goes in my \'tip wallet\' which I can tip to the performer (with a nice visible \'top up tip wallet!\' button below that.  That gives me an incentive to start tipping, because it\'s \'free\'.  That way I have the opportunity to tip a performer and get a photo or have them do something or whatever, and it provides a positive experience incentive to add more tip funds.  \nAt any point I can sign up for an account (just provide an email and password for example); this makes it easier to save tips if I change browsers and I also get a real username (not guest-$name).  \n\nBy making the system very approachable in this way, you can attract casual customers who ordinarily wouldn\'t have considered paying for one of those sites.

The teacher basically gave us a crash source in how to open Netscape Navigator and gave us a list of the dominant search engines at the time (Ask Jeeves, Yahoo, DogPile, etc.)  \n\nI remember that I had just read something in PC Magazine (which was still the shit back in the bad old dialup days before tech blogs and such) about this awesome new "still in beta" search engine called "Google," so naturally the first thing I did when I got my hands on a mouse and keyboard was go straight to www.google.com to see what the big deal was. This being middle school, some busybody girl immediately started commenting to the teacher about how I was visiting "some weird site" that was not on the list of suggested search engines. \n\nIt\'s really hard to explain just how awesome and revolutionary Google\'s PageRank was back in the day. I quickly discovered that by using Google, I was able to find the answers to my worksheet questions much faster than the other students using DogPile, etc. I was on my way to finishing what was supposed to be a 50 minute assignment in around 10 minutes, all thanks to the power of the Google.\n\nGuess what happened next? The teacher actually interrupted me right before I was about to finish my worksheet and told me that I shouldn\'t be using "unapproved" sites despite the fact that I showed her - literally showed her using the computer screen - how fast and awesome Google was. Her response was something like "Google is not as reputable as the search sites I gave you guys" and she just walked away as the other students continued to agonize over how to phrase questions so that they actually found something relevant using AskJeeves.\n\nAt the time I thought nothing of it other than being slightly frustrated at the teacher\'s lack of understanding, but in retrospect it is amazing how many people, including fully grown adults, are just not willing to operate outside of their very limited cognitive space. The above is nothing but an anecdote, of course, but I sometimes wonder if that teacher still remembers brushing off a student who tried to introduce her to Google back in the late 90s before it took off.\n\nWhatever the case may be, I choose Google back then and I choose Bitcoin now.

After that, they are managed by companies called registrars \xe2\x80\x93 there are hundreds of them, including such popular ones as Go Daddy, register.com and Network Solutions.

If you look at fiat in terms of buying power, I think it also depends on WHAT you're buying and the volatility of the item itself. I think there is a big difference between items like bread and milk and items like gasoline or gold. There is a lot more to each equation than simply looking at how volatile the currency is.

For example, what would the world be like if we all used one currency, regardless of whether it is fiat or not? If everyone used BTC and it remained just as volatile, would it matter? If everyone paid twice as much for everything, then I feel it is just semantics. I don't care if I pay twice as much for everything if I get paid twice as much as I do now.

Every participant can make entries in this ledger, which records transactions of a certain amount of currency from one participant to another participant, and every one of those entries is then propagated to the network in realtime, so that every copy on every computer is updated near simultaneously and all copies of the ledger are kept synchronized. The official term for this public, distributed ledger is the \xe2\x80\x98blockchain\xe2\x80\x99 (which you can see here), and it uses Bittorrent technology to keep all copies synchronized.\n\n>Imagine during the Byzantine era, there is a fortified city-state, Byzantium, that contains within its walls wealth beyond the wildest dreams and avarice of its neighbors. It is surrounded by ten other city-states, each of which is also wealthy, but nowhere near as wealthy as Byzantium. All ten neighbors covet Byzantium\xe2\x80\x99s wealth, and wish to invade and take it for their own.\n\n>However, Byzantium is so well defended that none of the neighboring city-states is strong enough to succeed at an invasion. Any lone invasion attempt would fail and result in the total annihilation of the invader\xe2\x80\x99s army, leaving it vulnerable to invasion and pillaging by any of the other nine, all of which also covet each other\xe2\x80\x99s wealth and constantly scheme against each other. Moreover, *Byzantium\xe2\x80\x99s defenses are so strong, that it will take more than half the of the ten neighbors\xe2\x80\x99 armies attacking simultaneously to overcome.*\n\n>...\n\n>the only way that the ten neighbors can communicate and coordinate the attack time is by sending messengers on horseback amongst themselves. They can\xe2\x80\x99t all meet in one place for a conference (none of the kings trust the others outside the safety of his own fortress or army). However, they can send as many messengers, as frequently as they want, and to whomever they want, at any time. Each message contains something like \xe2\x80\x9cI will attack on Day 4 at 0600, will you join me?\xe2\x80\x9d.\n\n>If the recipient agrees, they attach a signed/certified/sealed/verified response to the original message, then send out copies of the newly combined message to all 9 neighbors again, asking each of them to do the same. The eventual objective is to have them all agreeing to the same time by adding all ten of their seals onto the same message chain. The result will be a message chain with ten seals all agreeing to the same time, and probably several discarded message chains that contained a few seals but not all.\n\n>However, the problem is that if each city-state sends one messenger apiece to each of the other nine, then that\xe2\x80\x99s 10 cities sending 9 messages each, 90 total in transit at any one time, and each city receiving 9 messages each, ostensibly each with different attack times. Further, some of the cities will agree to more than one attack time, intending to betray the originator, so they will rebroadcast more than one message chain. This system quickly degenerates into a completely untrustworthy tangle of conflicting messages and attack times.\n\n>**Bitcoin solves this problem with a simple (in hindsight) modification to the system \xe2\x80\x93 it adds a cost to sending messages, which slows down the rate of message passing, and does so with an element of randomness that ensures that only one city-state will be able to broadcast at a time. The cost that it adds is a \xe2\x80\x98proof of work\xe2\x80\x99**, and it is based on calculating a random hash algorithm. A hash is an algorithm that does nothing more than takes some input data and performs a calculation on it that results in a 64-digit string of random numbers and letters, like this:\n\n>d70298566aa2f1a66d892dc31fedce6147b5bf509e28d29627078d9a01a8f86b\n\n>In the case of bitcoin, the input data consists of the entire ledger/blockchain up to the current point in time. And while a single hash value can be calculated nearly instantaneously with today\xe2\x80\x99s computers, only a hash value where the first thirteen characters are zero is accepted by bitcoin as the \xe2\x80\x98proof of work\xe2\x80\x99. Such a thirteen-zero hash code is extremely improbable and rare, and currently takes the entire bitcoin network about 10 minutes of searching before one is found. Billions of invalid hash codes are generated before one machine in the network randomly lands on a valid one, and this is the \xe2\x80\x98proof of work\xe2\x80\x99 that slows down the rate of message passing and makes the whole system viable.\n\n>...\n\n>**The machine (or city state in our analogy) that discovers the next valid hash code is the one that gets to take all previous messages, append its own, along with its signature/seal/etc, and broadcast out to the rest of the network. As soon as the other machines in the network receive and verify this new thirteen-zero hash code and attached messages, they stop their current calculations, update their copy of the ledger with new version, and start calculating the hash again by feeding the newly updated ledger/blockchain to the hashing algorithm. The hash calculation race is reset from a new starting point and begun anew. Thus the network constantly syncs itself so that all computers on it are using the same version of the ledger for their hashing calculations.**\n\n>So the crux of why Bitcoin is special: It represents a solution to a difficult algorithmic problem that was not possible until a confluence of historical events:\n\n>The creation of the Internet.\n\n>The invention of public key cryptography.\n\n>The invention of the P2P Bitorrent Protocol. Bittorrent was originally developed for sharing many static files between relatively small subsets of the users on the network, but Bitcoin repurposes it to share a single continuously-updating file amongst all users.\n\n>**The realization that adding a simple time delay into the system along with public key cryptography to verify individual transactions could solve the problem.**\n\n>If some of the most brilliant ideas are simple in hindsight, #4 at least certainly qualifies, though overall the project has stood on the shoulders of giants.\n\n**And in the [words of Satoshi himself](http://www.mail-archive.com/cryptography@metzdowd.com/msg09997.html)**\n\n>The proof-of-work chain is a solution to the Byzantine Generals' Problem.\n\n>A number of Byzantine Generals each have a computer and want to attack the King's wi-fi by brute forcing the password, which they've learned is a certain number of characters in length.  Once they stimulate the network to generate a packet, they must crack the password within a limited time to break in and erase the logs, otherwise they will be discovered and get in trouble.  *They only have enough CPU power to crack it fast enough if a majority of them attack at the same time.*\n\n>They don't particularly care when the attack will be, just that they all agree.  It has been decided that *anyone who feels like it will announce a time, and whatever time is heard first will be the official attack time.  The problem is that the network is not instantaneous, and if two generals announce different attack times at close to the same time, some may hear one first and others hear the other first.*\n\n>*They use a proof-of-work chain to solve the problem.  Once each general receives whatever attack time he hears first, he sets his computer to solve an extremely difficult proof-of-work problem that includes the attack time in its hash.  The proof-of-work is so difficult, it's expected to take 10 minutes of them all working at once before one of them finds a solution.*  Once one of the generals finds a proof-of-work, he broadcasts it to the network, and everyone changes their current proof-of-work computation to include that proof-of-work in the hash they're working on.  If anyone was working on a different attack time, they switch to this one, because its proof-of-work chain is now longer.\n\n>After two hours, one attack time should be hashed by a chain of 12 \nproofs-of-work.  **Every general, just by verifying the difficulty of the \nproof-of-work chain, can estimate how much parallel CPU power per hour was expended on it and see that it must have required the majority of the computers to produce that much proof-of-work in the allotted time.**  They had to all have seen it because the proof-of-work is proof that they worked on it.  **If the CPU power exhibited by the proof-of-work chain is sufficient to crack the password, they can safely attack at the agreed time.**\n\n>The proof-of-work chain is how all the synchronisation, distributed database and global view problems you've asked about are solved.": 7, 'There has never been a block size fork.

Some of these nodes are also miners, who dedicate computing power to the network, and their incentives are a bit different.\n\nNone of these *have* to correlate with "holding" Bitcoin of course, but since Bitcoin holders have a stake in the game, they are more inclined to be involved with all this (running nodes, programming, funding developers, funding companies, etc.). Plus, services have more incentive to attract Bitcoin holders. Again, if some Bitcoin exchange switches to sir_lanka_BTC, it\'s fairly certain that they would immediately collapse.\n\nThis isn\'t to say that some rule changes can\'t survive without consensus.

However there are many use cases where MPesa does not work internationally.  Additionally, you were charged $0.99, but surely the KES rate you received was not the market rate, rather negative a significant margin.   BitPesa takes 3% off the market rate, no additional fee. Special rates for larger amounts. So still the cheapest option out there. Also, 95% of our many clients are Kenyan nationals!  All of our BTC Sales are from Kenyans -- we have seen huge volumes this first week of selling!  Looks like Kenyans are like every other population on the planet -- excited about innovative, cheap, and efficient technology!! ': 1, "What Bitcoin does provide is a way for Kenyans to make purchases internationally.  Even those with bank accounts or credit cards often aren't able to make purchases abroad simply because they cannot a credit card purchase to be approved.  For instance, not having a street address (which is the norm here), makes billing address verification steps that e-commerce relies on to fail.     This problem goes away with Bitcoin.\n\nAdditionally, anyone wanting to send funds abroad has to convert to dollars and pay a bank wire fee which is not insignificant.  But the fee for sending a couple hundred dollars worth using bitcoins purchased from BitPesa is pretty reasonable.\n\nSo while each of the 18 million or so current M-Pesa (Kenya) users can today purchase bitcoins through BitPesa, few still have solid reasons to do so, or those who would benefit aren't (yet) aware of Bitcoin as an alternative that is less expensive, or faster, or more reliable, etc.": 3, "So does this open up bitcoin to everyone who's already using m-pesa? I know a lot of stuff can get overhyped in /r/bitcoin but surely this is pretty damn significant?": 6, "It's very significant, of course it was a natural evolution. (when you build a remittance product you bring bitcoin into Kenya and exchange it for Kenyan shilling, so obviously at some point this creates liquidity and a market for bitcoin in Kenya). It's significant because it's really hard to get access to bitcoin in Kenya. Exchanges barely exist, because there's no real liquidity (e.g. what Tim Draper did with the SR coins, provide liquidity in South America.) Liquidity is missing because there's no real mining being done, nor are there elegant financial systems for everyone to access foreign exchanges, and capital controls are found in many African countries even if banking services were available to all.\n\nSo this is great. Build small pools of liquidity in an African country through a natural inflow of bitcoin: remittance.\n\nObviously it won't be a game changer. I think Bitpesa is actually running pretty low volume still. And MPesa worked not because it was digital money, it worked because everyone who didn't have a bank account could use it because most people had at least a feature phone with non-internet connectivity. We don't have the option available right now to build a bitcoin wallet to use that specific type of connectivity on feature phones.\n\nSome bitcoin wallets using SMS definitely do exist (like Coinbase), but that's not what Mpesa uses. It uses USSD and STK apps, which require permission from the mobile network (the carrier). That's one of the main problems. In fact, one bitcoin company built such a wallet in Kenya and it was shut down because it used connectivity on a closed network of a mobile network operator, as opposed to an open network like bitcoin.\n\nSo it'll be a while til this catches on. Kenya has experienced inflation of 30% yoy just a few years ago, so bitcoin could be an interesting store of longer-term value even when a bitcoin wallet as a 'daily driver' isn't convenient. But for that bitcoin is just too volatile still (2014 is the case in point).\n\nSo really you either need \n\n1) a very cheap and elegant SMS wallet and a local (business) community to drive adoption, education, awareness etc. \n\n2) A bitcoin business partnering or obtaining permission from a local carrier. (a big VC investor supporting a solid company and a bit of government lobbying can go a long way). This way you'd be able to get bitcoin wallets just like Mpesa wallets. \n\n3) The emergence of smartphones and at least ubiquitous low-bandwidth mobile internet. This one isn't as far off as we may think. In 2013 Kenya saw a $50 smartphone. In 2014 Kenya saw a $20 smartphone (yes, with facebook, youtube, google maps etc and indeed bitcoin apps). And sending a transaction requires 500 bytes of data. Cost of data transfer is about 20 cents per 1 billion bytes in developed economies, for some perspective, and we've seen many initiatives for low-bandwidth internet everywhere (e.g. Google's project loon). This way you can offer exactly the same bitcoin experience as say in the US with a nice wallet on an internet connected smartphone. \n\nOnce THAT happens, too (liquidity + wallets), in an economy where the next best alternative is shit (Mpesa charges 11% to send $6 or so. It's amazing and I love it, but only because there's nothing better) then yes, it'll be really significant.\n\nJust to wrap it up, one of the exciting things about bitcoin is that it's a protocol-level phenomenon. No need for anyone to actually use bitcoin as a currency. i.e. once you get (3) into the hands of Kenyans (some liquidity, cheap smartphones, low-bandwidth internet and bitcoin wallets) then they can move away from bitcoin and move away from Kenyan shillings and Mpesa. They can for example move to the dollar or the euro. Simply by using a service like Bitreserve or Coinapult locks. Storage and transfer of fiat values like dollars or euros, but powered by bitcoin, for a small fee of 1-2% that's nothing compared to Kenya's 7% to 30% inflation.": 2, 'oh i need to send more funds to changetip. my mistake. sorry man': 1, 'But there is one area i believe it will succeed and that is the making it easier for a kenyan to make purchases online.\nI say this because i have never been able to buy anything online with paypal or a credit card but i have with bitcoin.\nWhy?

When Safaricom came out with m pesa, it was easy to convince the already satisfied crowd to join on board.  A. Lot of Kenyan diaspora use moneygram to send money home,  I wired $100 to my family's  phone and i was charge $0.99,  there might be other fees charged at a pickup location but it is cheaper faster,  reliable and trustworthy.

My concern is that the SS7 hacks allow an attacker who knows my phone number to get access to my mycelium private keys. More likely I would assume he could trick MPesa or BitPesa users' phones into sending him money, as these services work with USSD codes.\n\nMy concern is that private keys on telefones are inherently insecure thanks to SS7 being without security.": 1, "anyone interested in further reading, I'll leave this here:\n[Reverse engineering a qualcomm baseband - pdf](http://events.ccc.de/congress/2011/Fahrplan/attachments/2022_11-ccc-qcombbdbg.pdf)": 1, "I finally got a chance to look at the video.  Yeah, this is all doable with the right access to the carrier's core network.  You can imagine any government likely has its hooks into the network.  It's a bit harder for the average Joe to do this.  However, there are many, many smaller service providers around the world that create a lot of opportunities for exploit.\n\nHowever, even though this exists with legacy networks and, as the presenter pointed out, many of the flaws brought over into the LTE networks, these security issues are not unique to phone networks.\n\nYou know how when you visit your bank's web site you get a lock icon and you feel secure about the interaction.  Just as your phone call can get intercepted and re-routed without you knowing it, so can your visit to your bank's web site.  You can buy a certificate from many companies selling them.  There are hundreds, if not thousands, of companies selling them.  Even Wells Fargo -- a bank! -- is a root-level certificate authority that can, if it wanted, produce perfectly valid certificates that your browser will accept when you visit a competitor.  So, just imagine that it only takes one of these companies to produce a bogus certificate.  This has happened before, BTW, so I'm not even talking hypothetically.\n\nNow, with a certificate in hand, it needs to be possible to intercept your DNS queries.  Just like the SS7 protocols, DNS is largely insecure today.  You can ask for the address of your bank and a hacker can return the address of his/her proxy server.  With the bogus certificate installed, you get a lock icon and all your traffic looks secure, but all of it is intercepted.\n\nOn IP networks, DNSSEC exists, but relatively few domains actually implement it.  There is also a new technology called DANE that, when used with DNSSEC, would prevent an attackers from being able to carry out the exploit I just described.  Right now, no browsers support DANE.  Windows machines do not validate DNS queries using DNSSEC, either.  (I doubt most end-user operating systems do, though Linux can be configured to enforce DNSSEC.  I run my own DNS server in my house and enable DNSSEC enforcement to help thwart some of these kinds of attacks.)\n\nSecurity is really a big problem with just about every protocol out there.\n\nBut back to your original question: being able to intercept or manipulate your telephone calls (going over LTE or 3G) is not going to impact bitcoin.  Bitcoin transactions could be blocked by an attacker on the IP network (either in the LTE core or outside).  However, the way that Bitcoin is designed, the only thing an attacker can do is try to block the transaction from going through.  No coins will be lost of transferred to the wrong party.": 1, "I'll watch this later, but SS7 is protocols used in legacy phone network. They're not so easily hacked since the protocol restricts what you can do, though interfacing with them is simple enough. But, it's not like the Internet where you can gain access to a node and do whatever you want.\n\nThat said, the modern phone networks built from SS7 and moving quickly to packet-switched systems like IMS could open up new opportunities for hackers.\n\nThat said, I don't see any relationship with bitcoin.  Did the video mention it or does any hack on any topic make you fear somebody might still your bits?": 3, "I'm not aware of a single smartphone where the baseband has any kind of access to the memory of the application processor.

Professional actuaries could curate bundles of insurees. Rather than a large bank underwriting the insurance, many people could micro-finance the insurance. The actuators could compete for highest rate of return, while still offering the best service to the insurees.\n\nWhy hasn't this happened already? In theory, it's possible today with traditional banking and USD. To be honest, I don't know that much about the insurance market or laws, but I'm guessing it's so regulated, and the current system is so opaque that it's simply impossible.\n\nAssuming the current insurance market suffers from lack of transparency and over-regulation, Bitcoin does a few interesting things to shake the situation up. \n\nFirst, it allows unprecedented transparency on the source of funds, the total assets backing the total liabilities, and history of the curators performance and payouts. A blockchain based insurance market could be designed such that it is impossible cheat with respect to the backing assets and potential liabilities since the contracts, or redeem scripts, could be publicly audited. This might be enough to lessen the regulatory requirements.\n\nIronically, this level of transparency also introduces new competition from black market insurance. Even if distributed insurance becomes illegal, the blockchain is so powerful that it could allow for anonymous underwriters to write pullet-proof smart contracts such that neither side needs to know each other nor trust one another. For instance, since insurance is simply betting, what's to prevent someone from placing a bet that the temperature in Iowa will be above 100F for 1 week strait in 2015, or that there will be less than 10 inches of rainfall? On the other side of this bet, what's to prevent a farmer from anonymously betting against this - aka buying insurance?\n\nAs long as the market is providing something very close to a free market price, black market insurance is going to be a non-existent or a niche industry. However, anywhere where there is significant rent seeking, black market insurance may bring in new competition and either replace white market players, or force them to reduce prices to marginal costs.\n\nAnother inroad for disruption could be small community self-insurance. Lets say you attend a church with a few thousand attendees. The community could self-insure if it feels that its average risk is less than the general population. This happens today (http://www.chministries.org/), but the barrier to entry could be greatly reduced by the blockchain by significantly reducing the legal and administration costs. In the absence of regulation, community insurance contracts literally be packaged as a downloadable app that takes 10 minutes to set up for your organization (I'm thinking 5+ years from now we will have all the building blocks for this).\n\nTo be honest, I'm not sure how any of this speculation on the disruption of insurance markets will go, but it's one of the many interesting experiments that's about to happen in the next 10 years :-)\n\nNote: I have no idea who http://www.chministries.org/ nor the quality of their service...
