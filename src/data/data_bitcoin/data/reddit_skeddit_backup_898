So you\'ve got the strong hands holding a larger chunk of the tradeable BTC, and they are unwilling to sell at these lower prices, so the supply is much more constrained now, and any new buyers coming into the market will have to pay up to purchase their BTC.  This would cause the price to rise again until an equilibrium was reached where the strong hands felt BTC was appropriately valued, and some of them would return to selling a portion of their holdings.  \n\nYou follow?\n\nExample:  The weak hands get shaken out over the course of January 2014 to September 2014, and the price moves lower as expected.  Bullish news occurs (pick your poison: COIN etf launches, Amazon adopts bitcoin, etc) and there\'s a rush of people wanting to move back into the market, but now there are a lot less people willing to sell their coins because they\'ve been consolidated into the strong hands, and they ain\'t letting go.

Your insistence that the major players must rationally adhere to some one-dimensional game theory is naive.\n\nBitcoin currently has a "market cap" of about USD $7B. This is equal to approximately 2-3 days of QE (money printing), and from just one jurisdiction (the USA). Bitcoin penetration is a threat to their eyes, but currently a bit player. It would be effortless for the Federal Reserve to co-opt the majority of mining power with untold riches of instant fiat money.\n\nThat is just one vector that can compromise the success of Bitcoin, but there are several others.

BIPs implemented over the last 2 years seem to deal with incremental improvements such as simplifying multi-party key signing or making it easier for businesses to request payment.\n\nMany people, initially drawn to and invested in bitcoins and the idea of Bitcoin based on these core characteristics, have asked "why"? It seems to me that the questions keep cropping up because their questions have been summarily dismissed or the answers have been unsatisfying.\n\nAt this juncture, I find the probability of an alt-coin taking over Bitcoin\'s value proposition, in spite of Bitcoin\'s current dominance in network effect, to be growing by the day.

Normally every time you create a bitcoin address, you do it by taking a new random number, sending it through hashing functions to get a private key, and then another set of functions to get the bitcoin address. So the only way to back them up is to back ALL your private keys up. HD wallets use a single random number, called a "seed," and then generate the first private key from random number + 1, the second from random number + 2, etc, to make as many private keys and bitcoin addresses as you want (it\'s not actually as simple as just +1, +2, but it\'s similar). So, as long as you have a backup of that initial private seed, you can always restore all the bitcoin addresses you make.\n\nThe main benefit of this is to get rid of address reuse. Right now, when you send coins from your bitcoin address in most wallets, the change goes back to your own address (e.g. you have 5BTC, you send someone 3BTC, the transaction actually send out the whole 5BTC with the recepient getting 3 and you getting 2 back). With an HD wallet that can keep creating new bitcoin addresses, when you send someone coins, the change will be sent to a newly created address. So when someone looks at this transaction on the public blockchain, they will see coins leaving your wallet, but won\'t know which coins went to the person you\'re paying, and which went to you, since both will go to a new address. This greatly improves privacy (which can be further improved if we implement CoinJoin). You can also use HD to create separate receiving addresses for different people, or even different wallets, each with their own subset of addresses. And all of these can be restored with just the single seed that you initially backed up.': 30, "The sender side don't need to care about that ": 1, "Make it a non-default option, both parties happy.\n\nPersonally I'm all about the mBTC, so I'm ok with the status quo.": 5, 'In the address book?

Not an issue with bitcoin since sent transactions don't contain any sensitive information.

Do you see how worthless pretty much every feature you listed is for the consumer?\n\nNot a single one of the "main arguments" will be interesting to the consumer contemplating between the "iWallet" and bitcoin.\n\nAfter all, it\'s undeniable that consumer adoption is what drives the success of bitcoin.

Hell, even paypal is working on a solution that makes payments super easy. And I still don\'t consider them a threat to bitcoin.\n\n>Security, cheaper, faster, censor proof, global, no barriers to entry, those are the main arguments for bitcoin. \n\nI see the value proposition as combining the reliable scarcity of gold (the "store-of-value" aspect of money) with the transactional efficiency of digital fiat (the "medium-of-exchange" aspect of money) into a single form of money.  So any time I see people talking about how bitcoin has certain advantages as a payment system over credit cards / paypal / bank transfers, etc., I tend to wonder if they\'re not missing the larger point.  The real comparison is how does bitcoin\'s payment network compare to the "payment network" for *gold* (i.e. the process of passing around physical pieces of metal)? And the answer is pretty damn well.    ': 3, "> No, I just realized that no matter what I, or anyone else says you won't listen. So I can't even be bothered.\n\nI understand your arguments, they're just not very good. \n\nIt's not a straightforward as you think. If merchants save money by accepting bitcoin, both through transaction costs (BitPay now offers a 0% package for example) and fraud reduction (no chargebacks), then they will forward some of those savings on to the consumer. This is a financial incentive for the consumer to start using bitcoin. We've seen this with many merchants out there already. Newegg offering 10% discount when paying with bitcoin, tiger direct offering $20 discount on any order over $100, etc, etc. Reduction of cost on the merchant side will result in cost reduction for the consumer which will lead to financial incentive for them to use bitcoin. Simple as that.\n\n> It's a double edged sword. No chargebacks is good for the merchant, but awful for the consumer.\n\nNot really. There are 2 of 3 solutions in the works (granted, they're rare and are still in active development) that will offer payment dispute resolution, which is exactly what chargebacks should be for (as opposed to reversing fraudulent payments). These services are optional and will be competitive (as opposed to being baked into the payment solution, which is the case with credit cards), which will result in cheaper dispute resolution solutions than what we see no with CC's. \n\n>Nope, don't care about that. We are talking about consumers, not merchants.\n\nYou're the one footing this bill, so I would think you'd be interested in that. As stated earlier: merchant cost reduction will lead to reduced prices for consumers. That's simply a fact. Merchants compete for customers and the number one way to do that is by lowering prices. When the payment solution is optimized to cost almost nothing, then that gives them a competitive advantage.\n\n> Not even mentioning the volatility that can be fatal to the poor.\n\nAhem.

Individual wallet implementations may be lacking, but that\'s being addressed. This is not an inherent flaw in the bitcoin network.\n\n> it\'s barely cheaper,\n\nIt costs mere pennies to send a transaction, as opposed to percentages with credit cards.\n\n> don\'t know what you mean by "censor proof".\n\nI can send a bitcoin transaction to anyone, anywhere, of arbitrary size. You cannot alter the destination of any transaction not sent by you, you cannot block it, you cannot reverse it. Censor proof.\n\n> But it is faster, only in international transactions, though.\n\nIt\'s faster than credit cards too. It takes mere seconds to receive a transaction and have enough confidence that the transaction isn\'t being double spent (with a proper back-end implementation). Settlement of a bitcoin payment takes an hour on average (given you\'re adhering to the fee rules of the network) as opposed to *months* with credit cards.\n\n> Money has been global for decades now, bitcoin isn\'t really anything new in that regard.\n\nYou still can\'t use your credit card in the vast majority of countries. And you still can\'t send a wire transfer to a number of countries. Bitcoin is borderless. There\'s no difference between sending a bitcoin transaction to your neighbour or sending one to the other end of the planet.\n\n> Saying there\'s no barriers to entry is also a bit of a stretch. You have to go through quite a few processes before you can get your first BTC.\n\nThere is nothing stopping me from running a bitcoin client and offering my services for payment in bitcoin.

If you use a local wallet then there is no such threat. As stated time and time again, if you trust others to hold your bitcoin for you (coin base, circle, etc) then that\'s your choice. But it\'s not a requirement (as opposed to having an iTunes account with a credit card attached).\n': 5, 'Upvote for your opinion. I was/am speaking towards average US/First world consumer adoption.

We work hard to build a site where the crypto community can advertise, buy, and sell goods.  We do our best to provide excellent customer support, and put as much profit as we possibly can back into advertising and marketing to bring sellers and buyers together.  In the year since we launched CryptoThrift the team has never taken a penny for themselves. \n \nThe number of transactions being made outside of the site is now so high that we have been forced to take action.  We cannot continue to provide the site for free for these people.  For the past month all account activity has been monitored and we have compiled a list of users that we suspect have made transactions via Skype or our personal message system to exchange payment addresses and products.  At this stage we have decided against taking action with these users individually, and instead will issue a warning to all users.  If you  are buying and selling outside of CryptoThrift to avoid paying fees, you will receive one warning.  If you continue to trade outside of the site,  your account will be banned and you will forfeit any money that you might have in escrow with us at that time. \n \nPlease understand that we are a small start-up company and without the support of our users and the wider crypto community we will not survive.  We have already received some feedback that the number of confirmations required is one factor driving people to transact directly. As such, we have now reduced the number of network confirmations required to one for BTC and two for LTC, in order to complete your purchase.  Please let us know if you have any other suggestions to make using CryptoThrift a better experience and we will do our best to accommodate you. \n  \nThank you for your understanding, The CryptoThrift Team': 4, "What's mturk?

ORLY?': 0, '>Bitcoin won\'t be able to incorporate innovations of alt coins.\n\nI disagree. To borrow from an old comment of mine: I often see people say things like: "Bitcoin is a protocol that benefits from network effects, and such protocols are sticky." That\'s close, but bitcoin is actually a *dynamic* protocol that benefits from network effects, making it (potentially) super-sticky. Or, to think about it another way, bitcoin isn\'t *really* the current implementation of the Bitcoin protocol used to maintain and update the Bitcoin ledger; it IS that ledger. The protocol can be, has been, and will continue to be improved. If something significantly better comes along and begins to take serious market share from bitcoin, that would provide a strong incentive for bitcoin stakeholders to modify the protocol to incorporate the improvements. This doesn\'t mean that it\'s impossible for an alt-ledger to come along and overcome Bitcoin\'s first-mover advantage. That\'s certainly a possibility, but I don\'t believe it will be as easy as many people seem to think.\n\nAnother point I often make is that from a systemic perspective, we shouldn\'t actually want an alt-ledger to successfully displace Bitcoin. And I don\'t say that because I own a lot of Bitcoin (ok, that\'s not the only reason I say it), but because it would undermine the usefulness of crypto by making it a less reliable store of value. Money is memory. Its entire purpose is to facilitate exchange by *preserving* a reliable record of value given but not yet received. Switching *ledgers* every time an improvement in *protocol* is made is insane because it would essentially defeat that purpose. It\'s kinda like buying a more powerful computer every six months and throwing the old one in the trash without bothering to copy over your files.

But of course, it *could* happen.  If the cryptography behind bitcoin were broken suddenly and completely, there\'d be no way to repair the network and preserve the ledger because there\'d be no way to prove that you were actually the owner of any particular coins.  Bitcoin could also effectively "fail" if it\'s out-competed by some new and even better form of money.  Although here again, I think this is probably less likely than many others assume.

No direct comparison of "friction" of the currencies in question.

The folks at Inside Bitcoins do this for a living and I think they do a great job.\n\nFor those on a budget there are Meetups and some great low cost conferences like Coins in the Kingdom which MK Lords and Jason King are hosting which I believe is only $99 or something and has a great room discount also.\n\n": 12, 'Bitcoin in itself acts as a shovel and the gold.': -5, '> Second, the massive reduction in friction and transaction costs in the payment system will mean that investors can reinvest those savings.\n\nWhere is this reduction in friction? From only using bitcoin? Do you realize that, unless massive changes to it happen that no one I have ever heard of is working on, bitcoin has far more friction than the current monetary system?\n\nI guess you could argue that if EVERYONE used it, it would be low(ish) friction, but I don\'t see this.\n\nAs for me, the general economic theories I have read that support my view are those revolving around fractional reserve banking (I know, evil). The increased lending power has made economies explode, as those who need capital can access it, and this increases overall economic growth and production power. It has pretty much allowed the modern world to exist, because with it, the amount of available capital to be used towards actual production increases (not just some BS money market stuff that provides "returns" for investors, but actual businesses getting far more capital than otherwise could exist), thus, actual production increases - as long as returns on the investment outweigh debt costs... which are fairly negligible, since [interest rates are typically quite low](http://i.imgur.com/U5Hzfxk.png), except in extremely poor economic times (see: the early 1980s USA).\n\nIt seriously encourages long term investment in physical capital.\n\nI mean, let\'s look at what money market funds are:\n\n>An investment whose objective is to earn interest for shareholders while maintaining a net asset value (NAV) of $1 per share. A money market fund\xe2\x80\x99s portfolio is comprised of short-term (less than one year) securities representing high-quality, liquid debt and monetary instruments. Investors can purchase shares of money market funds through mutual funds, brokerage firms and banks.\n\nLess than one year? Garbage investment for economies. It\'s like financial crack. Short term investment is why we are in the financial mess we are in today.\n\nNow, equities can be good, given the right context. But, it still doesn\'t show itself to be a magic bullet. For instance, how would we have the sheer amount of business activity available to have a healthy equities trading market if large firms can\'t access large amounts of capital when needed? If all money is a fixed amount and cannot fluctuate with the economy? That\'s crazy dude!\n\nNow, I will admit, the current system can be (and has been) abused from time to time, and it allows firms to exist when they otherwise should have failed. There is a possible moral hazard with easy lending towards large firms - see the bank bailout, for instance. A precedent has been set that they\'re so large we will cover their poor investment strategies, or poor financial instrument construction. So that is no good in that case. BUT, we can\'t just write the whole thing off and expect bitcoin to fix it. You need proper regulation that prevents firms from creating excessively risky financial instruments (like derivatives based off of "liar\'s loans", for instance), OR you need regulation that will hold firms more accountable in explaining how their instruments are created, or something like that.\n\n>Third, Bitcoin being a global system, cross-border capital flows will increase like never before.\n\nI don\'t buy this, though. Cross-border capital flows will only increase for the smaller types - people sending money to other people. Large firms already easily send large amounts across borders.\n\nFurthermore, I don\'t know if it\'s necessarily even good to let small amounts flow easily, as every small-time hopeful arbitrageur will try predicting currency fluctuations and develop some kind of trading schemes like that, possibly exacerbating economic crisis in countries having a difficult time (but this would require probably a PhD dissertation to make the case for, so I am not equipped to deal with that  at the moment in a reddit post).': 2, "Putting on conferences is tough.

Similar, there is a new strain of unbankables - the Bitcoin businesses. Despite complying with all regulations, many Bitcoin businesses can\'t get a bank account or have their current ones shut down.\n\nBanks are needed to function in today\'s world - to transfer money, to hold money, etc. Cutting people off from the banking services is like cutting them from the utilities.\n\nSince Bitcoin is an inclusive technology, it allows the unbankable to do everything the banking sector offers without the fear of being shut down, without the fees or red tape. This should be the core of the story - talking about how Bitcoin solves the problems of the unbankables and how banks impose their agenda on the money.': 1, "Agreed.
