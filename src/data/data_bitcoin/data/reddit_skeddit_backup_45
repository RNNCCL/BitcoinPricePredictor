They seemed to be accessible and speaking to me very clearly.\n\nYou\'re probably right regarding many others (i guess), but for me, no.\n\n> Bitcoin suffers some from being highly, highly developer centric. (They are not alone in this space; many projects built on blockchain and blockchain like tech do.)\nFor example, Bitcoin Core does not have any members that perform management tasks like maintaining communication channels with various shareholders in the ecosystem (payment processors, miners, wallets, merchants, users, etc.).\n\nI guess that\'s being worked on now and has improved then since this sort of criticism has come up. Personally i don\'t really give a fuck tbh. Core is not a company with a budget for all that, not it\'s that the open source way of doing things anyway.\n\n> Bitcoin Core doesn\'t have any members that focus on documentation. Soft tasks, i.e. not development, were totally and likely mostly still are considered independent and outside Bitcoin Core\'s responsibility.\n\nWiki, website, documentation and forum posts explaining things were improving at a rapid pace (among others by /u/maaku7 if I\'m not mistaken) before that criticism was even raised. All in much better condition than probably any other young in high flux open source project. Developers were all very accessible through many forums and IRC and even in person on meetups. And again they don\'t owe anything to anyone. It\'s open source, it\'s their own free time, not being paid, not a company.\n\n> I think the feeling is that such tasks are not necessary. And what was learned is that large shareholders are not necessarily willing to have their concerns, timetables, businesses ignored.\n\nThen they should do it themselves or pay for it. Open Source. WYSIWYG and if it\'s not enough they can fuck off. (My opinion, apparently not the Core opinion as change is underway, as you say next.)\n\n> I think Bitcoin learned this, but would not have without the debate. And I think they are working on making sure at least some of these soft tasks don\'t get ignored.\n\nI\'m not sure that i think it\'s fair that it falls on their shoulders where some would better spend their time on what comes natural to them: hard core devving.

The end result is a mechanism for achieving consensus in a distributed environment, whether it applies to account statements or adding new descriptors for quantum bitcoin.\n\nWhat I must stress about quantum bitcoin is that transactions do not require adding information to the blockchain. Just like banknotes and coins, they are not clonable (thanks to the no-cloning theorem of quantum mechanics) and can be verified by the receiving party without having to add a transaction to the blockchain.

The smart contract approach gives the owner of the funds partial or total control over their coins so there\'s no "exchange" to hack. The problem is: if the traders have full control over their funds then by definition no exchange can enforce that the funds are moved as part of the trade (if they\'re on separate blockchains) -- so the traders can easily back-out and collect a refund. You can solve that problem by taking away some of their control but now you\'ve reduced security which was the whole point of using smart contracts. I suggested that identity verification + legal contracts was a very simple way that decentralized exchanges could use to encourage honest behavior without needing to reduce security / control which is currently the approach that multi-sig oracle style decentralized exchanges use (e.g. B & C.)': 1, "But how can you recover them then?
