My one question is, what kind of mechanisms for Key Trust does the software use, to prevent MITM attacks? I couldn't seem to find anything about verifying keys.\n\nObviously the standard Certificate Authorities are out of the question, and something like the [OpenPGP Web of Trust](http://www.rubin.ch/pgp/weboftrust.en.html) requires the parties communicating to have an out-of-band channel to compare key fingerprints... I know, this is not an easy problem to solve, but I strongly believe that it is not one that should be ignored. I fear that your tool may become subject to rampant MITM and impersonation attacks that could completely undermine the system.": 7, "> rather to provide some privacy from network observers (the nodes/server your wallet is communicating with).\n\nYes, but your wallet gets around communicating with the servers one time only. After your mate broadcasts the transaction, your wallet is going to receive the data proving you spent the coins. How is subspace any better than running Tor here?\n\n> We're not talking a out pulling coins out of your wallet, rather sending you a payment request over the messaging channel which you would have to authorize before a payment would be sent\n\nOK, but how is that any different from what Thomas V suggested doing? You're basically sending an invoice over something that isn't SMTP? SMTP is rock solid, ubiquitously deployed and composes well with Tor/PGP whereas subspace is experimental and has competition from all kinds of P2P and anonymizing networks. Boatloads of them.": 3, "> I don't get how this prevents a global passive adversary from grouping your addresses together?\n\nThis isn't intended to prevent blockchain analysis, rather to provide some privacy from network observers (the nodes/server your wallet is communicating with).\n\n> Not without taking over my private keys you couldn't.\n\nWe're not talking a out pulling coins out of your wallet, rather sending you a payment request over the messaging channel which you would have to authorize before a payment would be sent.": 3, 'Hey, this looks awesome! \n\n> Furthermore, BIP70 is currently a "pull" model, where your wallet downloads the payment request only after clicking a link or scanning a QR. Using this protocol, we could "push" payment requests to users and enable monthly billing and various other services.\n\nThere\'s a better way to deal with this that allows for far more interesting use cases. [Payment routers](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/2rmxna/what_closing_the_loop_can_look_like/). The payment router could use subspace to get subscription iou\'s pushed to it and from there on do its thing.\n\n> There are only two coinjoin implementations at present and both are running on independent servers. Ideally we shouldn\'t be segregating coinjoin participants by server. It makes the pool of participants smaller, leading to less robust mixing and longer mix times. Since subspace allows for real time communication, we could run protocol like coinjoin over it. (On a related note I\'ve had a number of conversations with Tim Ruffing, author of the coinshuffle[4] paper, and the one thing it\'s been missing is an appropriate communication channel).\n\nThere\'s another one called [Join Market](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=919116.0) that has some very interesting ideas for coin join (maker / taker market model to incentivize participation). This one also stands to benefit greatly from a proper communication channel.\n': 3, ">There's another one called Join Market that has some very interesting ideas for coin join (maker / taker market model to incentivize participation).   \n\nCoinShuffle, when done right, will find plenty of participants for free.

That would mean there should be a highly noticeable rise in transaction volume, because thousands of new people are adding at least two transactions to the blockchain (one transaction in, one transaction out). [There is no evidence of this in the transaction volume history.](https://blockchain.info/charts/n-transactions?timespan=all&showDataPoints=false&daysAverageString=1&show_header=true&scale=1&address=) Even if it wasn\'t just Cypriots and oligarchs, but instead foreigners discovering bitcoin for the first time, there should be an increase in transactions because new people are flooding into the market. There is no evidence of an increase in transactions, so we can rule out option A.\n\n* In option B, Cypriots and oligarchs buy bitcoins and then, inexplicably enthralled with the technology and no longer concerned with simply moving money beyond the grasp of Greek regulators, hodl\'d them. In Option B1, they hold their bitcoins for a long period of time. That should result in a price spike as they buy bitcoins, and then a price collapse as they hold them without transacting them again. Demand temporarily increased, then should have returned to about the same levels. In Option B2, they buy bitcoins and then gradually sell out of them over time.

Say you have some funds available to you on a broker who lets you trade on margin (eg Bitfinex in the bitcoin space).\n\nOther people on the providers site let you borrow their money, in return you pay them interest on the funds you borrow and the provider makes sure that you always hold enough funds to be able to repay everything.\n\nNow the fun starts. Once you have borrowed the money (or bitcoin if you want to short), you buy real bitcoins on the market as if it was your own money. Now if price increases, you can sell your coins and repay your creditors and have some leftover. This leftover money is your profit.\n\nNow you say why dont you buy the bitcoins with your own money, if you have to have funds to borrow funds in the first place - good question and here is the key: You can borrow much more that you have, that\'s called "leverage". Eg. on bitfinex you can borrow 3.3 times as much as you bring to the table. \n\nThat also means that your gains/losses multiply if price moves in the right direction or against you. All in all this is a very risky trading style and should be left to professional traders. You can lose (almost) everything if you are "margin called", ie the broker is asking you to add more funds but you cannot. Then your positions is "liquidated", ie. the bitcoin you bought are sold through a market order, the proceeds are used to pay off part of your creditors and the difference still missing is taken from the funds you have deposited at the broker\'s. The margin call comes early enough to make sure that the value of your funds + the coins bought on margin at market value > open debts with creditors.\n\nHope that helps.': 1, 'can you ELI5 what buying on margin is, in the context of btc?': 1, 'It depends on timeframe.

When the price looks a little better, buy it back. You\'ll find that selling lower than you want by several cents and buying higher than you want by several cents can increase the amount of trades per hour dramatically.\n\nThis isn\'t quite realistic, just because BTC hit a certain price doesn\'t mean YOUR coins were sold, but it\'s a decent enough idea.
