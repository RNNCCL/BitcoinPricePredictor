I wonder if you are really the Visa PR department - if so, I hope you are happy that we all use your company as the Gold Standard of traffic figures, and I\'m sure you\'ve been enjoying watching your newest competitor thrash around in the block size debates.\n\nI wrote the page in question. I think your statement is not correct. The Scalability wiki page does not mention 24,000 tps anywhere (are you looking at some different version?), and it uses Visa figures from 2013, not 2011. Check the link in the first paragraph. It goes to a 2013-era blog post that it seems Visa has since removed: too bad, but the numbers from it are still in the page:\n\nhttps://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Scalability\n\nYour number of 60,000 tps doesn\'t seem to be anywhere on the Visa website or in any recent press release. I will assume therefore that you really are Visa PR and this figure will appear in some official communication sometime soon, as bumping peak capacity by 4ktps sounds perfectly plausible .... I\'m guessing that this fairly small increase comes from improved software optimisations and possibly further US EMV rollouts that reduce your risk analysis overheads.\n\nFrom watching the rather cool Minority Report-esque video on your linked page, the current best traffic figure we have is "up to 10,000 tps". That used to be peak traffic terms during the shopping season and I suspect it\'s now more like peak daily rates.\n\nThis is very far from the peak load test rates. It\'s not possible to directly compare these figures with Bitcoin. That is partly because in a highly centralised system like VisaNet there are a handful of very large datacenters. So for redundancy there must be overcapacity. Your figure would amount to approx 3x overprovisioning which is relatively standard in the high end data processing world (allow for 1 cluster in maintenance, 1 broken and 1 live simultaneously).\n\nNow, I think anyone who has a wiki account can refresh the scalability page, but if nobody does then eventually I will. It\'s not a very high priority compared to other things because "visa scale" has always just been a shorthand for "very large amounts of traffic". The difference between very large and "very large times 2" doesn\'t actually change much about the underlying arguments on that page, in the end. The calculations show that with today\'s technology a Bitcoin node should be able to process (now) about half Visa\'s public traffic figures with one high end server. \n\nLet\'s say we refresh that figure, and bump it to (say) a server 2x as powerful to keep up (e.g. 2x more cores, 2x faster NICs, 2x more IOPs etc). Does that change much?\n\nNot really - only people who are seriously delusional believe that Bitcoin will be reaching Visa-level traffic any time soon. It took Visa decades to reach these levels of traffic and that\'s *without* attempting to change anything fundamental about the financial system: no new currencies, no swimming against the political tides, no attempts to eliminate/reduce financial intermediaries, no research-level technical problems to solve (I would count powering CPUs via RF fields but Visa didn\'t invent that, it just uses it). So Bitcoin is taking on a much larger problem and certainly has nowhere near 10,000 full time people working on it.\n\nThis is one of the most tiresome aspects of the block size debate: the ridiculous assumption that demand for Bitcoin transactions is infinite, so if we raise some limit to (say) 20mb, then we will immediately process 20mb of financial transactions in every block.

There are probably 10000 altcoins in existence and probably EVERY possible name is already taken. Even if I would come up with a new name like SaruTobiCoin the next that will happen is that somebody creates exactly this altcoin.\nI just have a problem with their logic. So you are not supposed to select names for real world currencies/things. So I guess although Bitcoin is a virtual currency it is considered a real thing. But bananas are also a real thing. People could sue you because they could think they earned real bananas...\nAlso many games use maybe something called "credits". What would happen if Bitcoin would be surpassed by an altcoin called Credits?\nActually, do you know if it is allowed to use Fiat currency names in a game? I would like to price items in USD for example.\n\nSince I do not plan to include real Bitcoin tipping in the game I hope I will have less problems.

However in my other game,  Game of Birds im still using the Bitcoin image and they didn\'t say anything.\n\n Apple don\'t allow you to purchase in app items using anything other than apples "in-app purchase" system this is why I chose to do Bitcoin tipping rather then Bitcoin spending.\n\nHowever they class the game under their "Gambling rules"\nWhich means I had to\n1. set the rating to 17+\n2. not allow the game to be sold in China\n3. Include a disclaimer saying "apple does not sponsor the game"\n\nAlso they said that getting the coins had to be based on skill and luck and that buying the in-app purchase for bananas would not let you get more Bitcoin.\n\ni.e. you cant let the user buy bitcoin via an in-app purchase it has to be a reward/tip that is not guaranteed.\n\nBut it\'s really up to Apple and which reviewer you get so its best to contact them directly\n': 2, "Feedback...\n\n*Pros:*\n\n* Charming art/interface\n* Charming music\n* Nice animation (zooming in/out) while monkey is swinging, to bring a sense of perspective\n\n\n*Cons:*\n\n* Way, way, way too many advertisements; after every single monkey launch, you are brought to either a Genesis Mining ad, a request to buy a t-shirt, or a random popup 'special' to buy 500 bananas. It becomes annoying to see it this often and this consistently. I understand you need a funding source for the tips, but even choosing a random interval between 1-3 (meaning an ad will display either every 1 round, or 2 rounds, or 3 rounds) each time would be better. The randomness would 'feel better' since it's not so predictable (what I mean: maybe ad would show after the round, then the player plays 3 rounds and sees nothing until the end of the 3rd round, then the player plays 2 rounds and sees nothing until the end of the 2nd round).\n* The popup 'special' for 500 bananas really feels 'scammy' sorry to say, since you're not being awarded 500 bananas for free but rather being asked to buy them, which doesn't really qualify as a 'special' circumstance, right? So it's a misnomer.\n* It feels like the game is a missed opportunity as far as displaying the power of bitcoin goes. If you use BlockCypher's Microtransaction API (coincidentally I posted about it today, see the front page of /r/bitcoin), you can send microtransactions as small as 20 bits (~0.5 cents), and the first 8,000 transactions are free (they will pay the transaction fee). Further, they guarantee these microtransactions with 99% probability and speed of ~8 seconds. After the first 8,000 free transactions, the fee will range between 5-10 bits. All this is accomplished via BlockCypher's proprietary 'Confidence Factor' calculation. So, what can you accomplish by using this? I received a 110 bit tip (normally only 55 bits) for my 10 coins in SaruTobi, and was told I'd receive it within 24 hours. This seems a bit of an understatement of Bitcoin's power. Instead of this arrangement, why not send tips 3x more often at 20 bits/tip, instead of a 55 bit tip, and send them super fast within ~8 seconds. This would increase player satisfaction since the instant gratification factor would be increased.\n* Another Bitcoin idea: Is there a way to utilize 'payment channels' like in Streamium.io? For example, one idea could be to use its per-second nature to reverse the experience of Streamium (send bitcoins to the player rather than charging the player bitcoins), so that you tip the player micro amounts of bitcoins in the 'foreground' ('foreground' meaning an in-game counter is incremented, either as time goes on or via some other game mechanic.. maybe banana accumulation?), and after reaching a certain threshold, say the BlockCypher 20-bit minimum, the payment channel concludes and releases the tip in the 'background' ('background' meaning via the actual bitcoin network) to the player. The advantage is: continuous instant gratification from accumulating bananas/coins, yes, but also the expected monetary reward, instead of only accumulating bitcoins by having to luck out by hitting coins.\n* The gameplay could also be improved: 1) It's often the case that bananas/coins are located just a bit too high from the ground, so even if the monkey skids on the ground, the monkey won't come into contact with the item. This is frustrating. The items should be lower so the monkey does hit them rather than passing underneath them. 2) General placement of items could be arranged better so that the monkey collides with more items, instead of on average when I played only colliding with 1-4 items. 3) Also, it may be better if the monkey can bounce a bit, so that when it hits the ground, it bounces back up and hits more items. 4) There should ideally also be a way to buy a bitcoin tip with bananas. This is sensible because bananas are gained through playing. Playing more means viewing more ads. So, incentivizing playing the game more means more revenue for you, which means bitcoin tips can be shared more. Connecting say 100 (or whatever is fair) bananas with a tip would be a good way to incentivize playing more.\n* I'm a little concerned that Genesis Mining (cloud mining) is being advertised. It's generally known that cloud mining is a scam. Why not try to advertise some more legit services, like news (CoinTelegraph, CoinDesk, etc.), wallets (Coinbase, Circle, Airbitz, Breadwallet, etc.), exchanges (OKcoin, Coinbase Exchange, BitFinex, etc.), or something else similar? There would seem to be no end to legit services that could be advertised :)\n\nOverall, quite a nice game. I'll just emphasize again that, besides fixing some of the sharp edges to make the experience more pleasant and addictive, try to research ways (like with BlockCypher, and payment channel tech) to better make use of Bitcoin's power. This alone would be an asset for the game by 'wow-ing' players, and thus differentiating your game vs. the other million games in the App Store. I was genuinely excited, while playing and imagining ways it could be 'perfected' to enhance the experience.\n\nI'm actually encouraged to myself experiment with designing an iOS game using micro-bitcoin rewards as the addictive incentive. This seems like the first time a game can actually share advertising revenue with players. Instead of collecting meaningless coins (like in Sonic), the player can collect 'coins' with real value, albeit micro amounts that add up over time.

If 42 satoshi bought 2/3 of a kWh, then your electricity would cost $0.00015/kWh.\n\nConclusion: If electricity is more expensive than US$0.00015/kWh, you should just get a heat pump.\n\n": 2, "> KnC apparently just mines up in the Arctic Circle and vents the waste heat.\n\nMaybe that's why the ice is melting.": 1, "Is cooling a major cost?

The fact that it has BTC aswell makes it awesome, btw making bitcoin transactions to another getgems users is one of the easiest ways there is of any wallet. type '1 btc' press the btc logo and your done.\n\nEven if you would have just a simple wallet, to the outside crypto world it is an amazing technology, for us a bitcoin wallet seems not such a big deal but for banks and others who haven't been much involved with this technology its mind-blowing, so you have to look from their perspective, i make jaws drop when i pay with some unknown (in most peoples eyes) currency called bitcoin. ": 2, '[deleted]': 1, "> there are going to be ads in my messenger? why would i use a messenger that has ads in it?\n\nWith ads i don't mean you will receive a 30 seconds video which you will have to watch like other apps, thats annoying which i don't like at all. \n\nList of potential ads, the money you pay goes to the user.\n\n- Pay for sending personal unsolicited messages.\n- Pay for sending private message ads.\n- Pay for priority messages.\n- Pay for a sponsored appearance in the contact list / user directory.\n- Pay for a commercial company page / e-commerce.\n\nI will list what each one of these do in a min.\n\n>but to be quite honest they have a serious marketing problem.\n\nThats because the app is still in beta, might have some bugs and important features haven't been fully added yet, marketing it big at this point will do more harm than good.": 1, 'TIL the people behind GetGems created sidechains.  That is a major accomplishment if true.': 2, '**Pay for sending personal unsolicited messages**\n\nOne of the main problems of any communication platform is spam. The fact that communication is constantly becoming cheaper enables spammers to send bulk messages to unwilling recipients. The common approach to spam is heuristics-based flagging and filtering (this is how gmail works). The problem is that this method is extremely inaccurate and only works well if the same exact spam message is duplicated thousands of times. Users resort to hiding their personal address in order to avoid spam. Consider what would happen if a celebrity like Oprah would publicly share her personal email - no spam prevention algorithm would be able to handle that.\n\nIn a world where the spam problem has been solved, there would be no need to hide your address. Everybody\xe2\x80\x99s personal address will be public and we will no longer rely on secrecy to stop abuse. If you think about it, every major personal communication platform - such as email, phone, SMS, WhatsApp - fails at this point.\n\nWhy do we hate spam so much? The answer is basic economics. Reading incoming messages is time consuming, and our time is a very valuable resource. The straightforward solution is therefore basic economics as well. If consuming messages is expensive, sending them should be expensive as well. \n\nBy placing a gem price tag on sending personal unsolicited messages, we can guarantee that users pay for the right to contact you. It\xe2\x80\x99s important to emphasize that sending messages between friends (approved contacts) is not considered unsolicited since the recipient has explicitly agreed to receive messages from the sender. This means that within the Gems network, sending messages between friends will always be free.\n\nHow expensive should sending a message be? The natural answer should also rely on basic economic principles. The more popular the recipient, the more expensive contacting them should be. This concept is found in the bidding system employed by Google for their adwords platforms. Every advertiser enters a bid of how much they agree to pay for a click. Roughly speaking, the system displays the highest bids, making popular keywords more expensive because people are willing to pay more for them. Borrowing this principle to our model, we can decide on the number of unsolicited messages a recipient will receive in a period of time, and take the highest bids from competing senders.\n\nIt might be a good idea to make this mechanism opt out. If a user is willing to receive unsolicited messages, they should be able to allow strangers to message them for free.\n\nAnother interesting feature of this mechanism can be read receipts. The sender of an unsolicited message is probably interested in whether the recipient has read the message or not.\n\n**Pay for sending private message ads**\n\nUnlike unsolicited messages which are personal in nature (like introducing yourself to a beautiful girl and asking if she\xe2\x80\x99s single), ads are commercial in nature.\n\nThe central distribution channel in Gems is instant messaging. Private message ads are messages that will appear in the incoming message screen next to messages you receive from your contacts. These messages will be marked as promotions so recipients could differentiate between them and regular personal messages. A popular similar advertising channel is the promotion tab in gmail - where users receive promotional emails from advertisers directly into their inbox.\n\nThe key for maximizing the effectiveness of ads is targeted advertising. Keeping ads relevant makes both the viewer and the advertiser happy. Advertisers will not choose a specific list of recipients to receive their ads, but define some relevancy criteria for the target audience. Criteria can be based on content, similar to how Google adwords works - ie. show this ad to users interested in buying an engagement ring. Criteria can also be based on an audience profile, similar to how Facebook ads work - ie. show this ad to single males in the age of 20-25. \n\nEmploying content based targeting within Gems is mostly a privacy issue. Platforms such as gmail analyze (anonymously) the content of read messages and try to match a relevant ad based on keyword similarity. This can be performed automatically within Gems, but only on non-secure messages. Secure messages are encrypted client-client end to end and cannot be deciphered by the Gems infrastructure. In addition, content analysis should be opt out to protect user privacy upon request. \n\nProfile based targeting within Gems is a little more tricky. The Gems network does not require users to fill any profile information. An interesting potential solution is to let users provide a voluntary profile by answering questions that will help Gems deliver relevant content more effectively and personally (ie. what is your age). To encourage users to give as much details as possible, the network can compensate users using gems for doing so. A natural way to implement this is by taking part of the cost paid by the advertiser and giving it to the ad recipient. We can even make the payout proportional to the amount of provided profile data. Some profile data can also be generated automatically, but usually at the expense of privacy. A good example is geo-location. As long as the user agrees to share his location with the app, we will be to use this data in order to show local ads. It\xe2\x80\x99s important to emphasize that profile data will never be shared with the advertisers and will only be used by the network anonymously to deliver relevant ads.\n\nThe cost of advertising should probably be based on bids as well. The size of the target audience is limited (the number of participating users that fit the ad criteria), so only the ads with the highest bids will be shown. Another interesting question is whether these ads will be paid per exposure or per click (an advertiser only pays if a user opens their message and reads it). If we choose the latter, the natural approach would be to maximize the network profit from ads by factoring both the amount of the bid and the success click-through rate of previous exposures, and choosing which ads to display accordingly.\n\n**Pay for priority messages**\n\nQuality of service (QoS) is an interesting factor worth exploring for monetization purposes. Consider the real world example of shipping packages. The free shipping method is usually a standard service such as USPS, which takes a little longer to deliver and offers less control over tracking and delivery status. The shipper can pay extra for a premium shipping service such as FedEx, which arrives much faster and is generally more reliable.\n\nBorrowing from this example to the Gems ecosystem, users will pay for sending messages with a higher priority. Delivery speed and reliability are probably not the aspects to play with, because the standard free messages on Gems always arrive virtually immediately and are extremely reliable.\n\nSo what aspects can we use instead? One option is the sort order of incoming messages. Normally, incoming messages are sorted according to arrival time. It makes sense that high priority messages will always appear first regardless of arrival time. Another option is to highlight high priority messages and mark them for special consideration. This can be achieved by using a more prominent notification sound or by using bolder colors / urgency icons for the message in the incoming message list. Another option is to send several push notifications regarding a high priority message if it hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been opened by the recipient (instead of just a single one like we do with normal messages). Another option is to provide tighter control over delivery indication and notify the sender more prominently immediately when the recipient has opened the message. Another option is to display priority message inline in the incoming message list, meaning the recipient will not have to click on them in order to read their content.\n\nGenerally speaking, if recipients are aware that an incoming message was paid for, they will be more inclined to open and handle it in a timely fashion.': 2, '**Pay for a sponsored appearance in the contact list / user directory**\n\nThe Gems user profile will potentially include a status message. Every user can choose their own status line - which is very similar in concept to a Facebook status or WhatsApp status. This status line will appear below every username in the contact list / user directory.\n\nThe status line is an excellent platform for a quick 1-line advertisement. Consider the following use case - a startup looking for new developers. A member in the startup will set their status to \xe2\x80\x9clooking for talented ios/android developers\xe2\x80\x9d and invite any of their contacts to message them about potential applicants they know. \n\nIt makes sense to make these appearances sponsored as well. A sponsored result will probably appear first in the list of contacts (and probably be labeled as a sponsored result). In addition, we might also show sponsored results in user contact lists which aren\xe2\x80\x99t related as direct contacts. For example, even if I don\xe2\x80\x99t personally know the startup member looking for a developer, I will still see their sponsored result when I enter my contacts screen or when I search in the user directory.\n\nKeeping advertisements relevant is similar in nature to previous channels, such as targeting by content and targeting by profile. In addition, another interesting criteria is the distance between users (hop count or connection degree - 1st degree are immediate friends, 2nd degree are friends of friends, etc). It makes sense to show sponsored statuses from users who travel in similar circles.\n\n\n**Pay for a commercial company page / e-commerce**\n\nThe traditional entities within the Gems network are private individuals. Any user can join Gems and connect with their friends. Just like how Facebook grew to accommodate businesses as an entity within the network, Gems might make the same decision as well. Registering a new user as a commercial entity / business is a good candidate for a paid action.\n\nHow will company / business users be different from regular users? First of all, the profile page will have a commercial orientation and show relevant details about the business - such as an address / map location, website, logo, phone number, email, link to mobile app, opening hours, etc. In addition, business users will be geared towards e-commerce. Since the Gems network allows for easy fund transfers between users, it will be convenient to use for light e-commerce (1-click purchases).\n\nDeeper e-commerce capabilities will allow businesses to present a goods/services catalog, support checkout with Gems and provide light order management.': 1, 'Both Android and iOS versions now use SPV (\xe2\x80\x9csimplified payment verification\xe2\x80\x9d) bitcoin client, the wallet is connected directly to the bitcoin network, removing the need for trusted servers while maintaining much faster performance on mobile devices.

Once that happens all you need is one block larger than 1MB for the chain to fork into two -- one where the 1MB blocksize limit is still enforced and another one (used by Bitcoin-XT) with the larger blocksizes.\n\nBut that approach would bring incredible pain.  The goal needs to be that there is such overwhelming support for the change that no sane person would be willing to pay good money to acquire the coins mined on the original chain.  If that were to occur, the two sides could persist for quite some time.\n\nSo if you want the hardfork to do more than simply launch some hybrid new altcoin (which has initial distribution/premine to each person that held bitcoins at the time of the hardfork) then either consensus needs to be at the 90%, or maybe 95% level even. \n\nI don\'t think we\'re anywhere near that.     Take this potential outcome.  Let\'s say at the time of the hardfork the coin mined by the protocol that Bitcoin-XT implemented (lets call it BTX) trades at $120, and the bitcoin mined by Bitcoin Core with the 1MB limit enforced trades at $100.    Anyone that held bitcoins prior to the fork (i.e., "untainted coins") would only get value of $120 per bitcoin when spending them (unless they exclusively have the private keys and engage in tainting themselves).

Bitcoin is simple, and bitcoin CAN scale to world currency levels, recording EVERY cup of coffee on the blockchain, if only that silly 1Mb limit is lifted that was just meant as a temporary measure. Don\'t believe the myth that it can\'t. IT CAN. Satoshi was right.\n\nHe was only wrong in one thing: to assume it would be trivial to remove the limit later on. He did not count on people with other motives to cripple bitcoin, just to push their own "solutions".': 1, 'If you hold the private keys yourself, then you don\'t need to do anything until you want to spend them.\n\n"Tainting" your coins means installing Bitcoin-XT, buying a few satoshis worth of newly mined BTXs (i.e., mined on the side of the chain with the larger blocksize), and creating a spend transaction that includes the BTXs.  For instance, if you had 1.0 BTC prior to the hardfork, you buy one Satoshi (i.e., 0.00000001 BTX) and spend 1.00000001 BTX to a new address -- such as an exchange.   You can then at any time later go back to Bitcoin Core v0.10.x (or some other wallet that still supports the 1MB blocksize limit and import your private keys there) and spend the bitcoins with any exchange or service that still accepts bitcoins (BTCs) on that protocol.\n\nOf course, that\'s the DIY approach.  If there is a hardfork, I expect services like Shapeshift to offer to do the conversion on both chains for you and give you the full value on the chain of your choice.  E.g.,   If BTCs are $100, and BTXs are $120, you send a transaction with 1.0 pre-fork BTC (i.e., untaited) and they send you back $220 worth of either BTC or BTX (less a small fee).': 1, "Maybe we need to raise some funds for them, so they can upgrade their Commodore's 64 to Amiga at least. ;)": 1, "Block size limit requires a hard fork.

Closed platforms like Android and iOS (and yes, Android **is** a closed platform, due to all the secret proprietary blobs of code running with superuser privileges, mostly in the form of device drivers, particularly of the baseband chip) are not trustworthy *in extremis*, and so **nothing** should be communicated on these platforms that could arouse the interest of very high-level adversaries (federal law enforcement, Google themselves, etc.). That said, of course, actually acting on any intelligence gathered in such a controversial way would be extremely problematic (for the adversary), and would likely require some form of [parallel construction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_construction), in addition to the expense and paperwork involved with actually obtaining the intelligence in the first place. The expense of that should not be underestimated, and it may actually do quite a bit to tie the hands of an adversary, or force them to expend significant resources, even to obtain information that is "readily" available to them.

In the background, a protester was holding up a poster with an instantly recognizable logo: A \xe2\x80\x9cB\xe2\x80\x9d with two vertical bars, the symbol for the digital currency bitcoin.\n\n>Mr. Howard is an American IT specialist and a self-described bitcoin enthusiast. He surmised that the poster\xe2\x80\x99s QR code, which is a kind of square bar code, must contain the address of a bitcoin wallet belonging to the protesters. On a whim, he froze the frame, scanned the code with an app on his phone, and sent $10 worth of bitcoin to a country whose banks were paralyzed but whose protesters needed money to continue their fight.\n\n>It happened instantly, and the total cost of the transaction was $0.02.\n\n>If using unregulated cryptocurrency to crowd-fund foreign revolutions sounds like a quintessentially 21st-century edge case, here\xe2\x80\x99s a thing you need to know: The same fundamental technologies that enabled Mr. Howard\xe2\x80\x99s impromptu act of foreign aid are being used by hundreds of other companies, in many countries, to do something that has never happened in the history of money: Exchange it at any distance, nearly instantaneously and for near-zero transaction fees.\n\n>We are just at the start of understanding what this will mean. The safe bet is that the easier it is to exchange money, the more of it will be exchanged, with obvious implications for economies that successfully integrate these technologies.\n\n>Take Venmo, for example. Venmo is the Snapchat of money in that it\xe2\x80\x99s wildly popular with 20-somethings and on college campuses, and yet it is so unlikely to be used by people older than 30 that internally, the company calls that age the \xe2\x80\x9cVenmo line.\xe2\x80\x9d Venmo\xe2\x80\x99s mobile app makes it easy to pay friends for just about anything, usually things like rent or your portion of last night\xe2\x80\x99s bender. In 2014, the company handled $2.4 billion in transactions, and it is growing so quickly that it did half that amount of business in the first quarter of 2015 alone.\n\n>The cost of using Venmo is zero. Early in the company\xe2\x80\x99s history, this business plan, or lack of it, nearly killed the startup, but an acquisition by payments company Braintree (which was later purchased by behemoth PayPal) saved it. Like countless other newfangled payment services, including competitors Square Cash, Google Pay and even payments in Facebook Messenger, the reason Venmo can charge nothing is that payments within its network are just data bits moving around in a database somewhere, rather than dollars being moved between bank accounts.\n\n>All of these companies have to make money somehow, of course, and for companies like Venmo that means integrating with merchant services that do charge a small fee. Others, like Facebook Inc.\xe2\x80\x99s offering, are simply features of larger enterprises interested in keeping us on their sites and in their apps, the same way Google can afford to give away productivity software services free.\n\n>Aside from convenience, the way Venmo and these other services are better than cash is that it costs money to transact in cash. This isn\xe2\x80\x99t often appreciated unless you run a small business, but simply handling cash means losing a small percentage of each transaction in costs arising from the time required to procure and manage it. And there\xe2\x80\x99s also a cost for consumers. One study found that on top of ATM fees, Americans spend on average 28 minutes out of every month simply traveling to get cash.\n\n>Existing electronic-payment networks aren\xe2\x80\x99t much better. The duopoly of Visa Inc. and MasterCard Inc. has extracted enough in fees from America\xe2\x80\x99s merchants that Wal-Mart Stores Inc. is suing Visa for more than $5 billion, alleging the fees it charges when customers use plastic are unreasonably high.\n\n>I asked Visa about this, and it pointed out that many of these new services use Visa\xe2\x80\x99s network to get money in or out of them, from bank accounts. That\xe2\x80\x99s true, but it\xe2\x80\x99s also the case that for the most part they use the least expensive part of Visa\xe2\x80\x99s network, the debit card, which is itself enabled by Federal Reserve banks.\n\n>Things get even more expensive when you want to send money overseas. As of 2012, Americans were sending $123 billion overseas, mostly to relatives for whom the money is a lifeline, according to the Pew Research Center. Traditional services like Western Union Co. and MoneyGram International Inc. can charge fees that run as high as 8%, not including the less-than-favorable exchange rates they offer, but they\xe2\x80\x99re being disrupted by startups that employ novel methods to reduce costs.\n\n>TransferWise, for example, matches pools of people in two different countries who want to send money to the opposite country, thus eliminating the need to actually transfer money at all. (Imagine paying someone else\xe2\x80\x99s mortgage in the U.S. while they pay your tax bill in France.)\n\n>A Filipino startup called Rebit takes a different approach, exchanging dollars for bitcoin, which can then be transmitted and cashed out for Philippine pesos so quickly that the service avoids losing money on the volatility usually associated with bitcoin, says Chief Executive John Bailon. Total cost, depending on the country, can be as little as 1%, he says.\n\n>These trends have forced traditional banks to take notice, says Dwolla CEO Ben Milne. Dwolla has built a federally approved payment network, called FiSync, that allows any connected institution to instantaneously send any amount of money. As of last week, it does it all free. Payment networks like Dwolla raise the possibility that we will see even more free payment services, including some that aren\xe2\x80\x99t part of a larger company that can afford to eat the current transaction costs.\n\n>It\xe2\x80\x99s important to note that disruption in this industry isn\xe2\x80\x99t going to progress in the same way that, say, Netflix killed Blockbuster. Alex Holmes, chief financial officer of MoneyGram, points out that 90% of the remittances his company handles are cash to cash, and they are between people who don\xe2\x80\x99t even have bank accounts. These \xe2\x80\x9cunbanked\xe2\x80\x9d masses aren\xe2\x80\x99t about to start transferring money via bitcoin anytime soon. And Visa has been particularly savvy about investing in its own disruption, taking a stake in Square, whose Square Cash product runs on Visa\xe2\x80\x99s debit-card network.\n\n>We\xe2\x80\x99ve never lived in a time when it was so easy to pay a person or a business, and that\xe2\x80\x99s what\xe2\x80\x99s really exciting about these developments: We are at that transition point in which most of us own checkbooks and wallets as well as smartphones. Now imagine a time when all we have is our mobile device, or a pin-and-chip card and our thumbprint, and every time we want to support our friends, a local business or even foreign revolutionaries, all it costs us is a moment\xe2\x80\x99s consideration.\n\n>Write to Christopher Mims at christopher.mims@wsj.com': 15, 'Stop linking to paywalled stuff.

I am curious about the latter, too (in principle - I think this is years into the future at least) but building a hashed UTXO tree is something that can be done with the cryptographic primitives that are available right now, are being used in Bitcoin and can be understood by everyone.
