For the sake of argument, let\'s say that an anarcho-capitalist revolution has so thoroughly destroyed society that there are no businesses, corporations, families, or other organizations that have any advantage to start with.

They will find it advantageous to cooperate and trade, and businesses will form, cities will grow, and some people and businesses will be more successful than others, and will gain advantages as a result. \n\nInevitably, peoples\' and businesses\' property rights will begin to conflict. Economic activity on one person\'s property will adversely affect the economic activity on or the enjoyment of another person\'s property. Business A will claim the same resources as Business B, and rightful ownership will need to be established somehow. In the absence of an entity with a monopoly on violence, the stronger of the two parties in the conflict will prevail because there\'s nothing to stop it fighting for its\' "right" to that property more violently than the weaker party. \n\nSo through this process, some businesses or organizations will become enormous. For instance, a retailer might eventually have enough resources to build roads so that it can more efficiently move goods. And since the roads aren\'t public, the retailer could choose not to allow any competing businesses to use them. Any competitor would have to build its own, making the barrier to entry in that market too high for a startup to overcome. \n\nIn some markets, of course, several competing businesses might become powerful and begin to see how costly all these violent conflicts and competition are becoming. They will instead choose to fix prices and salaries, or make an agreement to become a cartel controlling the supply and therefore price of a resource.\n\nAll of these things lead to something similar to our situation today, where a few very powerful conglomerates/corporations/cartels have the power to control what resources and opportunities are available to the masses, and the only thing that will stop it is the same greed that has killed growth in demand in our current economic system. Once the masses have nothing left to spend, the temple built on their backs will collapse.\n\nRinse.\n\nRepeat.\n\nIt\'s been happening forever, and it\'s what the Founders were trying to prevent when they gave life to the USA. The ideals were there, but our execution hasn\'t been so great. Money and greed are more powerful than any system yet tried.\n\nWhat we really need is a level of technology that provides effectively unlimited energy and gives us such control of matter that our material wants and needs are always satisfied.

If you are in the minority and still want freedom, your only choice is to flee the USA or basically hide within it.\nThis is why Bitcoin is becoming so important to freedom.

Questions about wallet security and paper wallet creation?', 4): {"My opinions:\n\n1.- Wallets on PC's have a lot of attack vectors, so I personally wouldn't keep more that $100 bucks there.  You don't have to upgrade, but it's good practice.\n\n2 - The public key is created from the private key.  There is a one to one relationship.  Lose the private key, lose control of that key pair.  According to Satoshi, keeping every wallet you ever generate is a good practice.\n\n3 - I like https://www.bitaddress.org/.  Simplest thing is just to push your bitcoin-qt balance to the paper wallet, and not worry about the process of exporting keys.  [You do that via the console.](http://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/7536/how-do-i-export-my-private-keys-from-my-bitcoin-qt-client)": 1, '@1: Having the wallet encrypted with a strong password and having multiple backups, hopefully also at independent places is a really good security measure. \n\nA possible attack would be malware recording your keystrokes to find out the password of the wallet file when you type it in.\n\n@2: Yes, you understood that correctly. [Here](http://www.royalforkblog.com/2014/08/11/graphical-address-generator/) you can see the creation of a private key and the derivation of the public key and the address from it step by step. A more usable version to create keys and addresses for real world usage can be found at [bitaddress.org](https://www.bitaddress.org)\n\n@3: To unlock the wallet, type in the console window\n\n`walletpassphrase "your_passphrase" 300`\n\nThis unlocks the wallet for 300 seconds. Then type \n\n`dumpwallet /home/your_username/my_wallet.txt`\n\nif you are on Linux, change the path accordingly for Windows. I would do that on an offline machine, tough, because it saves your wallet in plaintext.\n\nOne thing that has to be worked into your backup strategy with bitcoin-qt is, that there is a pool of 100 addresses and keys in the wallet. If this pool runs out, new keys/addresses are created and those won\'t be in your backups, of course.\n\nThis is the reason why I recommend using a deterministic wallet, like Electrum. In it, you start from 128-bits of entropy/randomness and every key and address is derived from that 128 initial bits. They are called the seed and are all that has to backed up. And the way to back them up, is writing down a 12 word list, that\'s it.\n\nSo, my recommendation, if you are doing a backup routine now, make a new one: Create an offline installation of Electrum and back up that seed, really just 12 english words.

The company was founded in 2010 by two leaders in commercial and entrepreneurial space, Eric C. Anderson and Peter Diamandis. Our company has staff with world-class engineering, scientific and software knowledge. Several of our engineers are alumni of NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion Laboratory and were lead engineers, mission managers, and flight directors for complex and successful Mars missions such as Spirit, Opportunity, Phoenix, and Curiosity. Other staff have been drawn from innovative industry leaders including Intel, Google, and Space X. Planetary Resources is a company that has the technical expertise to achieve its mission of asteroid resource exploration and recovery.\n\nPlanetary Resources is privately funded, with investment from noted technology leaders such as Eric Schmidt and Larry Page of Google, H. Ross Perot Jr. of the Hillwood Group, Sir Richard Branson of the Virgin Group, and Charles Simonyi, formerly Chief Architect at Microsoft. This support has given the company the financial means to accomplish its goals.\n\nTIMELINE\n\nAsteroid resource exploration and recovery may seem like a distant vision, but Planetary Resources has already completed construction of its first spacecraft and is awaiting launch. Once deployed, this satellite will demonstrate core technologies for Planetary Resources future missions. It will also be symbolically significant, because it will mark the beginning of private asteroid resource exploration and recovery. Planetary Resources will be launching a new spacecraft approximately every few months to discover and explore asteroids and ultimately to recover the valuable resources on those asteroids.\n\nSTRATEGIC AND ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY\n\nAsteroids are abundant in three classes of resources: volatiles and water (hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen); platinum group metals (ruthenium, rhodium, palladium, osmium, iridium, and platinum); and structural metals (iron, cobalt, and nickel).\n\nWATER\n\nWater has a number of high value uses in space, but it currently costs in excess of $23,000 per pound to transport from Earth. Water will be useful for human exploration, as it provides hydration and radiation shielding. Water can also be changed into fuel, through electrolysis, thereby turning the water into its elemental components of oxygen and hydrogen. One 75-meter water-bearing asteroid has enough hydrogen and oxygen to have launched all 135 Space Shuttle missions. Spacecraft are launched with all the fuel they will ever have and therefore their lifetime is limited by fuel \xe2\x80\x93 the equivalent of throwing away a car when the tank is empty. Being able to store water and fuel in space fundamentally changes the ways we can explore space and conduct national and commercial operations in space.\n\nPLATINUM GROUP METALS\n\nPlatinum group metals are extremely rare resources \xe2\x80\x93 even rarer than rare-Earth elements \xe2\x80\x93 and are necessary for the construction of catalytic convertors, electronics, medical devices, glass, turbine blades, and jewelry. Today, the major sources of platinum group metals are South Africa and Russia. A single 500-meter platinum-rich asteroid contains more platinum than has been mined in the history of humanity.\n\nSTRUCTURAL METALS\n\nIt is extraordinarily expensive to launch heavy structures into space, and in most cases, the engineering design is optimized for the 9-minute journey to space, not for its use in space. Planetary Resources is developing the long-term capability to recover metals from asteroids and build specialized structures in space utilizing emerging technologies such as 3D printing. The capacity to build structures in space will fundamentally change commercial, civil, and scientific space activities.\n\nPlanetary Resources is not alone in this industry. There are other competitors here in the U.S. There is also strong competition coming from China and Russia. Both nations have stated their intent to begin developing the technologies to recover resources from outer space.\n\nASSURING U.S. LEADERSHIP\n\nPlanetary Resources believes the ASTEROIDS Act does three things critical to developing U.S. private asteroid resource exploration and recovery: 1.\tProvides a clear statement of resource ownership in full compliance with international obligations 2.\tBegins the discussion on oversight and regulation 3.\tEstablishes U.S. leadership in policy and a new market\n\nRESOURCE OWNERSHIP\n\nThe ASTEROIDS Act provides necessary clarity about who owns resources recovered in space by creating straightforward rules for U.S. courts to follow in adjudicating any future disputes between entities subject to U.S. jurisdiction. This clarity permits and promotes increased investment throughout the private sector.\n\nThe existing UN Treaties recognize, encourage, and allow the use of space by nations, and by non-government entities. The recovery and ownership of resources in space has been recognized for several decades. Specifically, it has been over 40 years since the United States and the U.S.S.R. each returned samples from the Moon, and more recently Japan did the same from an asteroid, and no nation or entity has raised serious objections to those nations\xe2\x80\x99 right to use and control the property they have returned from space.\n\nIt was the intent of the nations negotiating the relevant treaties that space resource exploration and recovery should not be prevented by the treaties. In 1980, the then Legal Adviser to the Department of State, Robert Owen, provided testimony to Senate\xe2\x80\x99s Subcommittee on Science, Technology and Space. Mr. Owen noted that these treaties were negotiated with the understanding that it does not prevent the extraction of natural resources.\n\nPlanetary Resources believes that the ASTEROIDS Act was carefully written to be in full compliance with all international obligations. The negotiating history of those obligations makes it very clear that commercial resource recovery in space and ownership of those resources is allowed and protected.\n\nOVERSIGHT AND REGULATION\n\nAccording to the UN Liability Convention, ratified by the United States in 1972, states are required to authorize and supervise the space-based activities of private entities to ensure they are complying with international obligations.\n\nThere are currently no U.S. oversight and regulation mechanisms that govern asteroid resource exploration and recovery. Planetary Resources believes the ASTEROIDS Act does an excellent job framing the potential development of these oversight mechanisms without being prescriptive \xe2\x80\x93 and without prematurely creating a new regulatory entity or spending new money. Writing legislation now that attempts to prescribe every operational scenario and technology that needs to be regulated would be impossible because many of this market\xe2\x80\x99s technologies and operations are new and still under development. The ASTEROIDS Act creates the framework for a productive exchange of ideas between Congress, the Executive Branch, and industry that can eventually lead to an informed, responsive, and productive regulatory regime.\n\nLEADING THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY\n\nThe ASTEROIDS Act is a domestic law and has no impact on non-U.S. concerns that may conduct asteroid resource exploration and recovery activities. However, Planetary Resources believes that the ASTEROIDS Act creates a foundation, in full compliance with existing international obligations, which could be easily adopted by other nations. The concepts of property rights, freedom from harmful interference, and safety of operations form the core components necessary for asteroid resource exploration and recovery companies from all nations to operate safely, predictably, and cooperatively in space. Planetary Resources firmly believes that the U.S. Government can use the ASTEROIDS Act to promote these core concepts in the UN and other international forums for international recognition and adoption.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nPrivate asteroid resource exploration and recovery activities are currently underway. Planetary Resources applauds the actions of Congress on this important and timely matter. With the ASTEROIDS Act, Congress has made clear that it is the intention of the United States to lead in this critical market.\n\nThe ASTEROIDS Act complies with all treaties, agreements and conventions to which the United States is a party; recognizes the need to develop applicable regulations at the appropriate time; and clarifies the right of U.S. entities to mine resources from asteroids. The ASTEROIDS Act provides a strong foundation for asteroid mining companies like Planetary Resources to begin commercial asteroid resource exploration and utilization in space, provides confidence to investors, stability to the industry, and builds upon a foundation of domestic and international law.\n\nRespectfully,\n\nChristopher A.

Notice how we\'re not comparing apples to apples, since TCP/IP is a naked network stack and AOL is a ton of user friendly services built on top of their own proprietary network stack. You can ask "Is TCP/IP better than the networking tech behind AOL?" and the answer is an earth shattering hell-ya. You can ask "Is TCP/IP more user friendly than AOL?" And the answer is hell no. To use TCP/IP you first have to build internet applications that make use of it\'s features, and then a critical mass of people have to use those applications, and it\'s up to you how friendly the applications are. AOL rolls right out of the box with goofy sound effects ready to entertain the lowest common denominator. But does that make AOL "better" than TCP/IP?\n\nBitcoin is a payment storage and transmission protocol. It can be used at it\'s bare metal interoperably by anybody on earth with even a dial-up level internet connection, and services built upon it can easily be controlled over even more modest communications mediums such as sms. It is unquestionably superior to the communications stack behind modern banking and credit card networks in almost every category, with some categories like "scalability" being an open question that are actively under further development.\n\nBut is it user friendly? *That is not it\'s job!* That is the job of wallet service providers who are utterly free to innovate on top of this unique platform. Providers like Coinbase and Circle, Greenaddress, perhaps Paypal quite soon, and whoever will come into being next.\n\nWe are not spending a majority of our effort championing user friendly sugar coating, we are championing the network stack. And to that end, *we do not require* the participation of people who will do nothing to add value to our network. People who are not either investing in Bitcoin as a store of value or creating innovative software themselves but only buy and then instantly sell again hoping to short circuit credit card fees (thus by definition carrying the narrowest possible margins), and who will inevitably complain about credit card consumer protection not being there for them no matter how many times we remind them about that trade-off.\n\nThis is like answering concerns that TCP/IP can never take off if it isn\'t helping people dial into AOL more cheaply than over a phone line.\n\nInstead we are more interested in software innovation, and in Merchant acceptance and Wholesalers and B2B. These participating nodes actually gut the requirement to deal with fiat *at all* so that participating users no longer have to exchange back and forth between Bitcoin and fiat. Instead we get a growing number of people who simply earn money in Bitcoin and then spend that to pay their bills and *that* is a far superior opportunity (made moreso as greater software solutions grow in this space) to ever using USD in relation to that percentage of your revenue at all.\n\nThis is the scenario which is similar to TCP/IP earning it\'s own protocols (SMTP, SNMP, HTTP, et al) and applications built atop them (Email, The World Wide Web, and eventually Google, Reddit and Facebook) that leave AOL entirely in the trashbin of history.': 1, 'Coinbase is more worldwide than it used to be.

For instance there might typically be 10000 transactions in a block and 99.9% of the time neighboring nodes idea of the current transaction set differs in fewer than 100 transactions.\n\nThe size of the IBLT is chosen based on that 100 transaction difference.

With this proposal, transactions only need to be sent over the wire once, and the IBLT is used as a kind of forward error correction or parity block.  \n\nThere will always be unlikely scenarios where the IBLT magic is inadequate and nodes will have to fall back to sending full-transaction-list transmissions.

It may be state funded, but the CBC operates at arm\'s length and is largely staffed by long-tenured people are are largely liberal in outlook.\n\nMany people in this country who are part of the conservative base that supports the party in power would want to fully defund and shut down the CBC if they could. (This would be a losing issue in an election if they did)\n\nWhich isn\'t to say the CBC is completely at odds with everything the government stands for either. Just like private and other public sector mainstream media outlets in Canada and the United States, the CBC does its part to engage in nation building / spreading nationalism and is ultimately loyal to the state, even when occasionally critical whoever is in power. Debate is largely framed in the context of politics and the competing views of the mainstream political parties and their different brands of social liberalism and conservative liberalism.\n\nNeil Macdonald is an exceptional senior journalist at the CBC who is prized by viewers and readers for rocking boats. Unlike most people who rise to the top in the mainstream media as reporters, Neil frequently exercises the independence his position gives him and covers very interesting points of view and facts of importance such as seen here that a lame "he said, she said" reporter would miss out on. Significantly, he always exercises critical assessment of statements by state officials from any country. State officials are not taking a face value.\n\nThe idea for doing an analysis piece on the US forfeiture situation would have been his -- probably not brought down on high by senior editors. But, I don\'t want to give the impression he\'s a pundit either. As a CBC journalist he would have been subjected to vigorous fact checking on all cited facts in that story. His stories on CBC television are generally not presented as On the evening news cast (/The National/), the anchor generally leads to him with \'now Neil McDonald, our senior Washington correspondent has more". \n\nLong story short: CBC journalism is independent of the government, Neil McDonald isn\'t a typical CBC journalist.': 1, "That doesn't make every opinion piece by the CBC is a representation of Canada's views.
