This is similar to how you connect to reddit using HTTP/HTTPS protocols to exchange data.\n\nThe method of SPV verification is to download the headers, verify that they form a chain, verify that the difficulty matches the required difficulty.  Then request transactions from your wallet based on addresses.  When you receive a transaction, the client performs a verification using the merkle root contained in the block headers to ensure that the transaction received is actually contained in a header that was verified.\n\nAs far as I know, this is the same way SPV is done in any SPV client.': 2, 'My understanding is that the way it is implemented it would leak a lot of privacy related information, but the key management was secure (well as secure as any other hot wallet). I think Hearn\'s implementation of SPV in bitcoinj (which is the back end of most of the other "lite" wallets) is considerably more robust, but I also know of privacy objections that have been raised there as well.\n\nBottom line, if you want privacy with Bitcoin, be an expert.

That's fine.": 1, 'No, (2) is wrong: other servers are only used to fetch block headers, and not to get Merkle branches. It is not necessary to fetch Merkle branches from several sources in SPV, it does not make SPV better, and it would actually decrease your privacy. The nodes that are used to fetch block headers are selected at random, and the GUI does not let you choose them. The GUI only lets you choose the main server, because that server is privacy relevant. \n\nFetching history from several nodes could indeed reduce the risk of a server lying by omission. However, I believe it is much better to implement proofs of completeness, because methods based on cross-checking multiple answers will never be really safe. (that\'s why Bitcoin does not use byzantine agreement)\n\nConcerning proofs of completeness, these ideas have been discussed at length in the bitcoin forum (I will let you do your research) and there is even a draft BIP here: https://github.com/maaku/bips/blob/master/drafts/auth-trie.mediawiki#Operational_proofs. In addition, a MIT student is about to publish an academic paper on a new method suitable for Electrum, at CCS2014. The paper title is " VerSum: Verifiable Computations over Large Public Logs". I cannot disclose his paper now, because it is still unpublished, but it will be published soon. I plan to implement this method, combined with SPV.': 3, 'Certificates are pinned because they are self-signed. However, Electrum 2.0 will support certificates signed by a CA.

': 1, 'The most they can do is lie about how many bitcoins you currently have.\n\nCheck sources like blockchain.info if you are unsure.': 1, "> Electrum does indeed connect to a single server in order to fetch transactions and address histories. However, it also connects to MANY servers in order to fetch block headers, find and verify the longest chain, and verify that all the transactions in its history are consistent with the blockchain, using SPV.\n\nTo be sure I understand:\n\n1. Electrum client receives transactions and address histories from a single server (the one being connected to via IRC lookup, or specified by the user).\n2. Other servers are consulted when fetching block headers and verifying transactions.\n\nIf (2) is true:\n\n- How are these other servers selected? For example, do these other servers give the client Merkle chains based on transaction hashes?\n- What information is the user given regarding the identities of these other servers? \n\n>Electrum currently does not have a way to verify completeness of its history (although this will be addressed soon). \n\nGood to know. What's your current thinking on how this will this be addressed?\n\n>Note that clients using bloom filters (Multibit) have exactly the same weakness: they can verify the transactions they receive (using spv), but they lack a proof of completeness too.\n\nMy understanding, which could be wrong, is that BitcoinJ nodes requests headers and blocks from multiple peers. The node can never be certain it got all transactions from its peers, although cross-checking responses cuts down the risk (assuming no Sybil attack).": 1, "Do not panic, instead understand the impact of what he suggests. \n\nHe's only mentioning privacy concerns, and data integrity concerns in relationships to payments received.": 1, "> Smh\n\nPerhaps you should get familiar with basic cryptography before you decide to write software handling other people's money. Weak security is significantly worse than no security. If a person believes a system to be secure they will act a lot less carefully than if they know it isn't. The fact that you think OneName.io is acceptable is just ludicrous, please don't distribute your wallet software for the sake of any fools that might choose to use it. \n\n> But you are free to keep placing 100% trust in a server not to keep logs, not to get subpoenaed, hacked, or backdoored. That's fine.\n\nThat's just attacking a straw man. I never said Electrum was private, just that bloom filters aren't.": 3, 'Started poking around the client repo as well. Found what seems to be the answer to my question about whether/how transactions are validated against the chain of block headers.': 1, "The servers don't implement SPV, the client does the SPV verification.\n\nThe servers can be set up by anyone and there are 20+ public servers being run by random people.  The client then performs SPV verification on the data received from the servers.  The client can verify that any headers provided by the server are not fake/low difficulty and that transactions provided are included in the real headers.\n\nI believe there is a possibility of withholding transactions from clients by the servers which could be undetected by the client.  If you're worried about that specific attack, then you would need to verify if transactions exist through another channel.\n\nThat is the correct source repository if you'd like to run your own server.": 12, '> The servers can be set up by anyone and there are 20+ public servers being run by random people. \n\nHow does the client decide which server to connect to?\n\n>I believe there is a possibility of withholding transactions from clients by the servers which could be undetected by the client.

When you say the client does SPV verification, that makes sense. What I\'m not sure about is the protocol. For example, does the server give the client block headers for use with Merkle chains? Or is some other protocol used. I saw some references to "Stratum". How does that factor into client-server communication?\n\nMaybe client-server communication resembles that between two peers on the P2P network. If so, that\'s not really clear from what I\'ve been able to find so far.': 2, '> The implication of your tirade was that server trusting wallets are better (unless that isn\'t your point then I don\'t know why you bothered to post.)\n\nNo such implication was made. I posted because bloom filters were being hailed as the solution from the gods, where they are really a blight upon the network and a severe DoS risk for anybody offering that service. \n\n> Bloom filtering isn\'t as private as running your own node and setting it as the trusted peer, but it is clearly more private than handing your addresses over to a server run by someone you don\'t know.\n\nThere\'s very little difference between the two. One has random peers from the network, one has a small set of individuals running servers. One gives addresses in the clear, one ever so slightly obfuscates them in a totally useless way. I wouldn\'t say there\'s a clear lesser evil amongst that. \n\nJust from your prior posts it seems that you have a rather loose grip on what SPV actually allows of clients which I find deeply worrying for somebody who claims to be developing software that interacts with the network. First and foremost you mention that you are looking forward to a onename.io/namecoin SPV client, which is just completely impossible. Due to the way the merkle trees are made you can trustlessly prove that an output is spendable within a block, but you can\'t prove that the block doesn\'t contain a spendable output without having the whole thing yourself. \n\nThis is a more important distinction in namecoin, because the maliciously un-sent information might be (for example) changing an IP address away from a hijacked pool, or updating an address away from a seed that has been lost or stolen. To that end you can\'t really trust SPV namecoin clients at all, which is why they don\'t exist. There\'s public DNS resolvers, but that\'s of course a completely trusted and vulnerable to all manner of on-the-wire attacks. \n\nA deeper problem is the existence of onename.io at all. Foolish wallets which support this horrible system hide all the unauthenticated, unvalidated data away from the user and just display the dirty name and address. There\'s no level on which this is acceptable behavior, as many of the names are squatted (maliciously or just to prevent malice). Even the published information that has "validation" attached is more often than not false or intentionally misleading. This is without even going into address reuse, which onename.io naturally encourages. \n\nLets imagine a user wants to donate to rushwallet.com, and types "rushwallet" into their client. \n\n    {\n        "website": "http://rushwallet.com", \n        "bio": "Set up an instant, secure Bitcoin wallet in seconds. No usernames, no passwords, no friction.", \n        "name": {\n            "formatted": "Rush Wallet"\n        }, \n        "twitter": {\n            "username": "rushwallet", \n            "proof": {\n                "url": "https://twitter.com/rushwallet/status/495639248444194816"\n            }\n        }, \n        "cover": {\n            "url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/dx3/rushwallet"\n        }, \n        "bitcoin": {\n            "address": "1reMovedForSAftey"\n        }, \n        "next": "i/rushwallet-1", \n        "avatar": {\n            "url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/kd4/rushwallet"\n        }\n    }\n\nLooks legitimate enough on the outset. That\'s their twitter account, it has their logo, bio, website all makes sense. However, it\'s a forgery created to fool people into donating to the phishers bitcoin address (removed from the data above). Would you have picked that? Users who see this is as a "trustless" system without understanding in full it\'s caveats are going to lose money at the hands of developers who include this awful system into their software.\n\nI\'m going to say it again. For the sake of the community, please don\'t write software handling other people\'s money. ': 3, "Important point: *none* of your BTC is in Electrum; if it's 'in' anything at all, it's in the seed phrase. In that sense, the only kind of problem with Electrum you'd need to worry about would be if it was giving away that secret.": 1, "Mike's SPV bloom filter stuff was and still is a complete disaster. It was pushed into the client without proper auditing which lead to CVE-2013-5700 (division by zero remote crash), the bloom filters are set to be so restrictive in BitcoinJ that there is no ambiguity or privacy, annnddd it's a massive CPU load on nodes which have no chance to support it for the time being.

First, the miner payout (and so the inflation) is high, with the hope that the increasing adoption, and thus increasing demand, will at least compensate the inflation. As the technology matures, adoption increases more slowly, but the inflation gets smaller too. In the end, we hope enough people will use bitcoin so they can pay little transaction fees and still cover the cost to secure the network (paying the miners).

In fact I believe he knows that at least bitcoin would need to be semi centralized with servers broadcasting the blockchain. Soon a standard computer won\'t be able to download it any more.

They surely aren\'t the perfect, ideal solution but they are by far the best option out there and it could be (and used to be) far far far worse. The fee structure isn\'t fantastic, but honestly as a small business owner who just "setup and go" with PayPal.. I\'d probably be in a world of trouble without it. PayPal gives normal folks access to an easy way to process online transactions. Realistically, that is an incredibly valuable service. For a 3% fee, I\'m OK with it.

And the fact that hardly anyone uses Bitcoin makes it an apples:oranges comparison.\n\nWhat I am not OK with, and this isn\'t limited to PayPal, is the entire burden of CC fraud being placed on the merchant. PayPal\'s dispute process is, at best, a sham for actual chargebacks (not their in-house disputes, which are generally more reliable). A chargeback basically hand PayPal $20 for being a hassle to them. I think I\'ve only ever won one chargeback, and that\'s because it was for such an egregious amount that it was worth my time to actually track the person down IRL, outside of PayPal\'s dispute system. And this is only really a problem when you\'re dealing with digital goods, which I just happen to be unlucky enough to be into. Bitcoin could, some day, be useful for that but as is it isn\'t. I use both, if I had to chose between the two it would be PayPal, hands down, every single time.\n\nBitcoin is a terrible mess of usability for the average Joe (read: customers). It *crudely* solves the customer fraud issue by allowing the merchants to be king of the castle. That isn\'t an actual solution, CCs would be the same exact thing without third party intermediaries (something you will see spring up if Bitcoin survives and actually grows into a usable product). It may be *technically* better than getting wrecked by WU fees but from the majority of posts I\'ve seen doing the math on here and /r/Buttcoin it is only ever marginally better, if not entirely equal [or with no local exchange far worse] and those never take into account the learning curve / time investment to learning how to use Bitcoin that uneducated people getting raped by WU can\'t put into it. Its the same shit argument that people bring up with regards to healthy food vs fast food and wonder why poor people don\'t just each rice and canned veggies every day of their lives. *But guys, they totally cost the same!!! So just eat healthy and don\'t get fat!* ..Well, yeah, if you conveniently ignore the fact that McD\'s takes less than 5 minutes and absolutely 0 effort to get.\n\n> for transferring money to someone overseas there\'s no quicker or cheaper way right now.\n\nYou can check /r/Buttcoin for the writeup, but IIRC it is only so cheap because the fees are basically being hidden within the mining rewards. At some point in the forever distant future miners aren\'t going to secure the network w/o financial incentive. When there is no built-in incentive (block reward), or it isn\'t big enough to be worth their time, miners will not mine. \n\nPayPal, lately, has also been hands down **100%** faster at putting money into my bank account than Coinbase. I have no idea what happened but they\'ve done a complete swap with each other in the last month or so. I have not had a single PayPal deposit go beyond 2 days, and Coinbase went from putting money into my account within 2 days to taking no less than the full 4 in their warning message. They\'ve also increased the amount of confirmations they require on deposits (6 is a little silly, waiting an hour for something they used to do instantly is a step backwards). PayPal doesn\'t make me wait an hour if someone sends me money for it to apply to my account (unless they accidentally eCheck, but that isn\'t PayPal\'s fault).\n\nFrankly, Coinbase was the only decent thing about using Bitcoin over PayPal, but since they\'ve downgraded their own service I really don\'t see the appeal between the two unless you\'re doing something illegal, arguably unethical, or that otherwise runs afoul of PayPal\'s clearly stated (even if you prefer not to read them) acceptable use policies. I\'m not interested in arguing if buying crack *should* be illegal. Fact is its illegal and so long as it remains so that\'ll be the only real-world use for Bitcoin that is a **major** step above other options. \n\n..Mostly, Bitcoin as it stands [its vocal community, especially] will never survive the real world - regulations and all. Its super neato, and I really like it, but I also like Beanie Babies (they\'re cute) and Pokemon cards (Charizard is the shit).': 2, "This thread has been linked to from elsewhere on reddit.\n\n\n - [/r/Buttcoin] [Top US Colleges now offering even more worthless degrees.](http://np.reddit.com/r/Buttcoin/comments/2fgdz5/top_us_colleges_now_offering_even_more_worthless/)\n\n\n*^If ^you ^follow ^any ^of ^the ^above ^links, ^respect ^the ^rules ^of ^reddit ^and ^don't ^vote ^or ^comment. ^Questions? ^Abuse?

Satoshi discusses. \n\nhttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=7.msg30#msg30\n\nedit: "TOR STINKS" presentation:\n\nhttp://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2013/oct/04/tor-stinks-nsa-presentation-document': 1}, ('Bitcoin Becoming Surprisingly Popular Choice Of Currency For Canadian Salaries: Payroll Firm', 13): {}, ('Igot: do not use', 12): {'This certainly provides some insight on what we deal with on a daily basis and how we fight fraud on our system - http://screen.willremind.me/image/1l1L393I431D\n': 1, 'Fuck IGOT\n\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/Auscoin/comments/2oq9f5/igot_scammed_buy_igotcom/\n': 2, '[deleted]': 1, '+1 BTCMarkets': 3, "Hi everyone,\nThis is Rick from igot.com.\nI would like to take this opportunity to go over some of your concerns.\nFirst of all, thank you for trying igot. \nI know some of you are not completely happy and are frustrated, and we totally understand that. \nAllow me to explain the process here and the reason behind it for you to see where we're coming from.\n\n\xe2\x80\x94\n\n1. Payments Processing Time for Incoming payments\n\nCash transfers: within 4 to 12 hours\n\nBank transfers: within 1 to 3 days (This depends on the banks). Also, even if you transfer from the same bank as ours, the statement does not show a transaction details (your reference number or name for at least 1 business day). Without those details, we simply do not know who sent that money.\n\nBPAY Transfers: within 1 to 3 days. If sent on a weekend, it will most likely be credited to us on  Tuesday afternoon.\n\n--\n\n2. Withdrawal restrictions are available upfront for everyone to see. Even before you buy any Bitcoin, it is listed on BUY BITCOIN, SELL BITCOIN, SEND BITCOIN page. \n\nWhy do we need this? \n\nEvery level has different withdrawal limits. This is done to protect ourselves from fraudulent transactions.\n\nIt might come as a surprise to you, but the number of banking frauds in Australia are alarming. Many people fall prey to phishing scams and give out their bank details. These unsuspecting customers get their bank accounts compromised and of course because we offer Bitcoin services, they would send us a BPAY, take Bitcoin out and be done.\n\nThis means the following:\n\n -- Unsuspecting customer will finally notice that there is some money missing from their account and complaints to their bank\n -- Their bank contacts ours bank\n -- Our bank contacts us alerting us of fraud\n \xe2\x80\x94 This means our bank will most certainly close our account and make sure they don\xe2\x80\x99t support any more Bitcoin related business\n\nIf we allow bigger withdrawals in the meantime, we're out of pocket.\nBitcoin has left the system.\nAnd by this time we've certainly burned our relationship with the banks, prompting them to ban our bank account and that would mean no more BPAYs for our business.\n\nBanks view Bitcoin as very high risk business and for us to make sure they are comfortable with it, we have put in place certain guidelines.\n\nThese guidelines help us keep our fraud level down, keeps the banks happy, and of course helps us grow our exchange.\n\nWe've caught over $250,000 worth of frauds in past 6 months alone because we have this in place.\n\nYou have to understand that we're a start up. We cannot afford to lose such amounts to fraudulent transactions.\n\nWe've spent months building this platform even before it went live. \nWe work hard every single day to make sure we're able to provide a good service to our customers.\n \nCan we make everyone happy? Answer is NO. We cannot make everyone happy. Every customer has different experience and expectations. Some think we're great, some thinks we're not worth it and thats fine. We can only try to change this perception by offerings better service and making sure we try and keep most of you happy.\n\n-----\n\n3. Bank authentication: We send $0.01 to your bank within hours of you adding your bank account. This process is completed from our end within 12 hours in most cases.\nNow, you have to understand that this is coming from our bank to your bank - depending on their arrangements with each other, this can take 1 to 3 days as well.\n\nWe absolutely cannot control this at all.\n\n-------\n\n4. Buy Bitcoin in minutes: This is not a false statement at all. \nOur platform works in a very simple way. \n- You load your fiat wallet with cash\n- You use that wallet to buy Bitcoin\n\nIf you have money in your wallet at igot, buying Bitcoin takes 2 clicks and way less than minutes. \nIf you want to buy something, you need to have money in your wallet and at igot, your wallet must be funded for this to happen.\n\n---\n\n5. Credit Cards: We do not accept credit card for Bitcoin. No big exchange does and no banks would work with us to do that. The risk is way too high to offer such service. \nWe're working with several e-wallet companies that will eventually allow us to accept payments in different ways and we expect it to be announced in coming weeks.\n\n----\n\n6. Our fee structure:\n\nWe compete with local exchanges in Australia.\nWe offer a local service in Australia, meaning you are dealing with a local business with local bank accounts.\n\nIf you are dealing with an overseas exchange, where the price maybe $10 lower than ours, that means you're also spending $22 to send that wire transfer to them.\nThat also means, you're paying $12 for each incoming wires.\nThat also means, you will lose some dollar value in 'exchange rates' between USD and AUD.\n\nWe make it simpler for you to buy and sell within Australia.\nAre we few dollars pricier than our overseas competition, yes we are. But when you calculate the saving or spending, you're spending same amount anyway.\n\nAnd as for 1% fee -- we are happy to work with you on individual basis to bring this fee down if you have enough volume AND history with us.\n\n----\n\n7. 7 day wait explanation:\n\nMany people are misguided by this 7 day wait period thing.\nMany people elect to read someone's experience on a forum and decide that they need to wait 7 days. Its not true for all and its not applicable to all.\n\nIf you deposit cash or bank transfers, provide your identity and are verified (which is done WITHIN 24 hours in most cases), you are Level 2 already and you can withdraw Bitcoin instantly.\n\nHOWEVER, if you send us a BPAY (which comes with huge fraud risk) - we ask you to wait 7 days from date of your FIRST TRANSACTION.\n\nWhy do we do this? \n\nBecause this allows us to go back to our bank and make sure you are the rightful owner of this account that you used to send us BPAY.\nThis takes 3 to 5 business days. That's why we put ONE OFF 7 day wait on ONLY BPAY Payments.\n\nOnce we\xe2\x80\x99ve done this process once, we know you are using your own bank account and we can trust you. This is when your limits are lifted automatically. \n\n\n\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\n\nAnd finally, we\xe2\x80\x99re a small team.\nOur business is growing quickly and we\xe2\x80\x99re still working on improving our system.\nWe\xe2\x80\x99re not perfect. No one is.\nWe learn from our customers\xe2\x80\x99 feedback and constantly try to improve our services. \n\nBitcoin may have started as some anonymous currency, but legitimate businesses are born in this industry. Government is taking active interest in the industry. \nOur requirements to make sure you are verified and you provide your ID is to make sure we\xe2\x80\x99re meeting our obligation to AML and KYC voluntarily.  \nWe\xe2\x80\x99re not here for a short ride. We take this business very seriously and we take the responsibility that it comes with very seriously. \n\n\nWhile you might not all agree with our process, many do.\n\nIf there were no fraud risks and we just offered cash deposits, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure we can all agree that our process will be different. But because certain payment methods pose threat, we need to be sure we are careful. Thousands of customers put their money and Bitcoin on our platform and believe it or not, we need to make sure we keep their money and Bitcoin safe. \n\nAnd honestly, we won\xe2\x80\x99t be able to make everyone happy regardless.\nAll I can tell you is that we work really hard to serve you everyday. And we appreciate your business. And we have a lot of gratitude for our customers for giving us this opportunity to serve them and grow our exchange.\n\nI encourage all of you to please take the time to read the FAQ, Browse the site and not be caught up with something you do not prefer. For us to have you at Level 2, there are conditions to be met. Its very easy and only takes a few steps. \n\nThank you.\n\nRick Day\nFounder, igot.com.\n\nPS: Please email us on hello@igot.com with any suggestions or complaints you might have. Our team will be happy to assist.

The second would be network members building and accumulating ownership shares in more expensive items, that they can then use as needed.\n\nFrom a software standpoint, we need a way for members to list their skills and tools, listing work needed and tracking bids/offers to supply the work (with multiple suppliers sometimes - a work party to put up a garage would need more than one helper), scheduling, tracking jointly owned/built items, escrowed funds, and sending digital files when you are feeding 3D printers and such.': 1, 'I am the complete opposite..

Like with any insurance, fraud is the main problem to deal with. But this just boils down to the ability to verify real-world facts in a trustworthy manner. I think it\'s a solvable problem. You already see some pretty innovative approaches to that in projects like [TruthCoin](https://github.com/psztorc/Truthcoin) and [Reality Keys](https://www.realitykeys.com/).\n\nThe difficulty is that the aforementioned projects relay on public information databases, whereas for facts related to insurance, i.e. I\'m a 25 year old male with no prior traffic accidents, you need someone to look at *your* particular situation and sign off on it. Again, I still think that trustworthy arbiters can be used to sign off on these things.\n\nThe more I think about, once these problems are solved, the really interesting parts of this concept come in with playing around with risk models. Since it\'s open source software, you can have a number of different insurance DAC risk models, some very conservative in terms of risk, others being very liberal. The DAC might even be able to "sell shares" of itself so as to incentivize the removal of whatever hazard it is insuring against.': 2, 'Sorry, OB?\n\nFor public information, [TruthCoin](https://github.com/psztorc/Truthcoin) has a very interesting approach that leverages crowds to arrive at the "correct" outcome of any event.': 1, "I'm not aware of any bitcoiners who boycott a business for accepting Doge or any alt whatsoever alongside Bitcoin.

It will be a gradual ratcheting up in utility. Things like OB should help, since feeds can offer their services there and take advantage of what might become an excellent reputation system at OB.": 2, 'swarm.com holy shit that is genious': 2, "As a developer, I thank you for those resources, I had no idea they existed.\n\nAlso, since I've been around internet marketing, I really didn't want to click on a bit.ly link, thinking that you are sneaking referal links in there without being open about it.

Many pieces of the puzzle aren\'t quite here yet, but primarily I see this as a DAC-type system that would have the following functional properties:\n\n1. Take in user premiums and issue colored coins as proof of coverage. This goes as follows:\na. User submits cryptographically signed demographic information to the DAC (i.e. user is 25-year old male with no auto accidents, etc). Signing authorities would have to be verified by the DAC as being trustworthy.\nb. DAC then issues colored coin token denoting coverage over set period of time in exchange for premium provided by user.\n\n2. When claims occur, users submit colored coin token indicating proof of insurance to the DAC, along with cryptographically signed statement of accident. DAC must verify claim as above, presumably by trustworthiness of signing authority. DAC then issues payment to user.\n\nThe "brain" of the DAC would be an actuarial database, from which it would draw risk data in order to determine the premium to charge users.\n\nThe real beauty of this is that (a) it could essentially replace the insurance industry as we know it, (b) it would be totally transparent (open source software), (c) it would be incapable of being stingy or slow about claims, and (d) in more advanced forms it could rapidly adjust its risk models to adapt to changing world events.\n\nSo yeah, go build that. ;)\n\nEDIT: yes I realize many things are missing here. In many cases, you need "signing authorities" to say that yes, you did break your leg. But for things like crop or earthquake insurance you could presumably just use public data feeds. Nonetheless I think it would be interesting to design this as a sort of "pseudo-code" experiment to see how it would work. Presumably you\'d build something like this on top of the Ethereum platform.': 2, 'Enjoyed your article, I especially like the clean/simple design of the layout, a much needed breath of fresh air from reading white papers.
