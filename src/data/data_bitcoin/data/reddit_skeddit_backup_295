If so, a market cap of 1/24=42 million USD is needed to support that transaction volume.\n\nAs many vendors immediately get fiat for all trades, it will keep the "velocity" up. Counteracting this are hoarders and speculators, which will slow down the velocity.\n\nIf the efficiency of Bitcoin improves (shorter confirmation times used), given the same transaction volume, the counterintuitive result is that the price will fall. Many journalists don\'t understand this. They regard a falling price as a sign of weakness.\n\nI think the velocity of money from the point of view of Visa is much slower.

Bitcoin reaching closed loops is a big step, it's not going to happen quickly. By closed loops I mean: people receiving bitcoin (either as wages, selling things on open bazaar, remittances etc), spending them to merchants, with the merchants then either paying them as wages or to suppliers, without any exchange back to fiat. I think this was the end-game many people considered when they first got excited about bitcoin - bitcoin succeeding as a daily currency for ordinary folks.\n\nIt's really hard for this to happen though, it's probably the hardest use-case for bitcoin to succeed in. The price volatility, paradigm shift from fiat, inaccessibility and unforgiving nature of bitcoin are big barriers to the regular joe.\n\nIt's easier for bitcoin to succeed as digital gold - easier to store offline, and many who like precious metals already get the motivation behind decentralised money, and aren't afraid to go against the fiat herd. It's easier for bitcoin to succeed as something speculators use as a trading instrument, something black/grey markets use, something used in the back-end by financial institutions and B2B where the average joe doesn't know he's using it indirectly. Similarly it's easier for bitcoin to be a platform for other indirect applications like ascribe or open bazaar.\n\nHere's part 1) of the funny bit though as I see it: Bitcoin HAD to have some success in the original merchant use-case to some degree as a proof of concept that it works - that it is money. It's important that some people have and will use it as a day to day currency, that big companies like MS and Dell started accepting it. even though this never expanded to the average joe doing this, it helped get bitcoin to critical mass for other uses. \n\nHere's part 2) of the funny bit: If enough of the other use-cases are successful to a large enough degree, it can give bitcoin the critical mass to have a second shot at the original merchant case on a larger scale. For this to happen the infrastructure will have to have reached a point where it's rock solid, it'll need the lightening network or something like it for scalability, it'll need user-friendly idiot proof wallets, it'll need to have been around for over a decade so it's no longer new and scary. It'll need either good enough services for hedging volatility or to have grown to a market cap large enough that price is no longer too volatile for acceptable daily use. Only then can the loops close.\n\n(Disclaimer: as someone that tries to be a bitcoin-realist, I'm aware what I've described above is the uber-bull case, and I wouldn't claim to be able to predict the chance of it happening, but I do think it's possible)\n": 2, 'It had no use as a store of value until people started spending it on things.

However, what if those people who matter (economic majority) can be convinced that it isn't such a bad idea, and in fact is a good idea (long term sustainability of the Bitcoin network)? If a fixed 2% per annum inflation rate is instituted, this means 50% halving in wealth over 35 years (or 50% halving in 70 years with 1% rate). Is that really so bad, if it means miners receive a steady incentive to maintain their hashrate?\n\nWhat comes to mind is this part of the article:\n> Consider that at a 2% inflation subsidy, the ownership by long-term holders only gets diluted by half every ~35 years. If you think that a low inflation rate and its benefits (outlined above) will lead to just twice as many bitcoin users and investment (when in reality the true impact will likely be measured in orders of magnitude), the net effect on your wealth is zero. We\xe2\x80\x99ve never seen a fixed supply currency, bootstrapped from nothing, with a population of users that was expected to increase exponentially throughout its formative years.

If not, what is the better alternative to solve the problem of compensating miners?\n\nPeter Todd mentioned recently that he and Greg Maxwell had discussed this fundamental problem in the past, but a clear solution had never been visible and that he doesn't really know the answer. I think most assume / hope exchange rate will rise enough to compensate, but I don't think the system should be designed with that assumption in mind.\n\nFor all we know, speaking hypothetically to give an example, bitcoin may need 20 years (5 halvings, or 32x decrease in coinbase reward) instead of 10 years (3 halvings, or 8x decrease in coinbase reward), before it gains mass adoption. I think the system should be designed to bootstrap itself and able to thrive, until it is mature enough to gain mass acceptance (greater capital represented by bitcoins).

The possibilities could change the way society is run\nBlockchain startups promises a world where no one is in charge\n\nThe blockchain eliminates bosses (Image: Tom Sibley/Gallerystock)\n\nTHE centre cannot hold. The rise of bitcoin took the right to issue money, once the sole preserve of governments, and placed it in the hands of everyone. Now a spin-off technology could do the same for other core concepts of society: identity, ownership, reputation and even the rule of law.\n\nThis technology is the blockchain, and it has the potential to enable the ultimate workers\xe2\x80\x99 cooperatives, or perhaps an ultra-libertarian parallel society, beyond governmental control.\n\nBitcoin\xe2\x80\x99s blockchain is a cryptographically secured list of every bitcoin transaction ever made. The list is stored on every machine running bitcoin software and is continuously updated as each transaction is completed. No central authority is in control: the machines essentially monitor each other to stop fraud.\n\nBut blockchains can be used for more than financial transactions. Last year saw the introduction of Ethereum, a blockchain platform that enables \xe2\x80\x9csmart contracts\xe2\x80\x9d, which automatically enforce agreements between two parties. You can think of a bitcoin payment as a specialised kind of smart contract, in which one person agrees to pay another a certain sum; but smart contracts can govern any agreement that can be digitised.\n\nEthereum was fully launched last month with developer tools to build distributed apps, or dapps, on its blockchain, and a host of Ethereum-powered services are springing up. One of the most developed is Augur, in which users bet on the outcome of events, such as who will win the US presidential election in 2016.\n\nThese kinds of prediction markets already exist \xe2\x80\x93 Betfair is the largest \xe2\x80\x93 but they are centralised, meaning that firms must handle money and rule on outcomes. Augur automates this, using smart contracts to gather consensus on completed predictions and pay winners.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt no point is a human being ever touching anybody\xe2\x80\x99s money, it\xe2\x80\x99s controlled by an algorithm and stored on the blockchain,\xe2\x80\x9d says Peronet Despeignes of Augur. The blockchain stores the reputation of users, ensuring that anyone trying to cheat the system is swiftly booted out. The service will launch fully in the coming months.\n\nExisting firms also see the blockchain\xe2\x80\x99s potential. Samsung and IBM are experimenting with Ethereum to control smart devices (see \xe2\x80\x9cOur blockchain future\xe2\x80\x9c), and banks such as Citi, UBS and Barclays, having seen the rise of bitcoin, are exploring the technology.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe evolution of the blockchain is perhaps the greatest advancement of computer science since the invention of the internet,\xe2\x80\x9d says Barclays\xe2\x80\x99 chief design officer Derek White. The bank has partnered with a number of start-ups and currently has 45 internal blockchain experiments. \xe2\x80\x9cAnything that requires proof of ownership through paper today can be replaced by the blockchain.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnything that requires proof of ownership can be replaced by the blockchain\xe2\x80\x9d\nParallel law\n\nSmart contracts could even go beyond ordinary businesses, giving rise to autonomous entities that live on the blockchain. For example, Etherplan is working on software that is designed to replace wealth managers by automatically investing according to a customer\xe2\x80\x99s desired portfolio, then paying out to nominated individuals. Once set up, it will keep going even after the initial customer has died, says founder Donald McIntyre. \xe2\x80\x9cIf a customer disappears, and we disappear, the smart investment plans are going to continue executing their investment strategy and distributing to beneficiaries.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBut how will these smart contracts interact with law in the real world? If I sell you my house by transferring ownership on the blockchain, but refuse to actually move out and hand over the keys, will the courts recognise that I have broken our agreement? At the moment, no one is quite sure.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not recognised by law because it is meant to be a parallel law,\xe2\x80\x9d says Stephan Tual of Ethereum. But if people start managing their affairs using blockchain law, governments will have to accommodate it, he says, just as the music industry had to adapt to file-sharing services such as Napster and BitTorrent. \xe2\x80\x9cThese technologies force the existing environment to evolve.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nWe\xe2\x80\x99ve already seen that happen to some extent with bitcoin, with new laws put in place to manage its use. And two government-mandated blockchains are already under way: a digital currency register in the Isle of Man, and a land title registry in Honduras. Perhaps whole governments could one day run on the blockchain, like a town council that wants to provide transparency in its decision making.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn order for value to be transferred across the blockchain in the future, there will have to be policy and regulation around it,\xe2\x80\x9d says White. Barclays has already started speaking to people in government about the way forward, he adds.\n\nBut as we have seen with bitcoin, the blockchain is also well suited to illegal activity. Take Silk Road, the bitcoin marketplace for illegal drugs that was shut down by the FBI in 2013. Smart contracts mean that someone could build a distributed Silk Road and then step away, leaving the market to run itself. When autonomous software is facilitating drug deals, who do you prosecute?\n\nFlorian Glatz, a lawyer and consultant to blockchain start-ups, says that despite their name, smart contracts are still software and not law, so traditional legal systems will still be needed for now. \xe2\x80\x9cThe vision of this world where smart contracts rule supreme is really only possible if the whole infrastructure is upgraded to obey whatever is written on the blockchain.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSuch a vision is a long way off, but it\xe2\x80\x99s easy to see how the blockchain could take on other forms of organisation. The functions of the app-powered taxi service Uber \xe2\x80\x93 connecting drivers with riders and managing payments \xe2\x80\x93 can be translated into smart contracts, but so can the ownership of the firm itself. Drivers could own shares in an automated Uber-like cooperative and avoid the fees Uber currently charges them. It\xe2\x80\x99s a reversal of the trend for technology to eat away at low-level jobs, says Tual. \xe2\x80\x9cHistorically we\xe2\x80\x99ve automated the workers, now we\xe2\x80\x99re automating the bosses.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHistorically we\xe2\x80\x99ve automated the workers, now we\xe2\x80\x99re automating the bosses\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s an irony that tech disrupters such as Uber, which claim to bring power to the people by cutting out middlemen, could themselves be disrupted by the blockchain, eroding their centralised power. \xe2\x80\x9cIn Europe there is quite a big concern about the growing dominance of US tech giants,\xe2\x80\x9d says Despeignes. \xe2\x80\x9cEthereum holds the promise of creating a new paradigm of decentralised applications that no one owns.\xe2\x80\x9d\nExtreme capitalism\n\nBut autonomous organisations could equally concentrate power in the hands of a few owners \xe2\x80\x93 or even none. Some have floated the idea of a blockchain-powered self-driving car that takes fares and pays for its own upkeep. This extreme version of capitalism, in which the means of production own themselves, could leave the rest of us to be bossed about by machines.\n\nThat particular example seems far-fetched, as someone ultimately has to be liable when a car crashes, but the libertarian bent of the bitcoin community makes extreme capitalism a concern, says Glatz \xe2\x80\x93 no one seems to be interested in replicating the welfare state on the blockchain. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re building up this infrastructure where our core concerns are more and more irrelevant because they cannot be captured by software.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThis power struggle over the future of the blockchain will probably unfold just as the internet has, with companies, criminals and hardcore idealists all carving out their own corners of the technology. What remains to be seen is how the public will feel about passing some of the most important mechanisms behind society into the hands of everyone and no one at the same time. Bitcoin caught on thanks to the potential to get rich quick, but these newer blockchain concepts are less immediately appealing. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s going to be the catalyst that will drive the greatest adoption?\xe2\x80\x9d says White. \xe2\x80\x9cWe don\xe2\x80\x99t know yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\nOur blockchain future\n\nThe range of applications built on the blockchain is growing all the time.

Approximately 70% of gift cards on CardCash.com are e-cards, meaning most purchasers will receive their redeemable code in 30 minutes or less.\n\nGift cards make up a large percentage of overall bitcoin sales because they bridge the gapbetween bitcoin users and many major brands that do not yet accept bitcoin payments directly. Additionally, the significant savings offered by CardCash is expected to boost the success of this partnership to new heights.\n\nBitcoin, a pioneering digital payments currency, minimizes the risk of fraud and chargebacks through its use of secure cryptography.

Quick clarification- Chain isn't a BoostVC company- Adam (the CEO) is a mentor though.\n\nA [few of us use Chain's tech](https://foldapp.com/blog/2015/03/29/native-bitcoin/)- they've been really helpful and the focus on uptime is refreshing, especially considering the [immaturity of many infrastructure providers in the space](http://blog.cardforcoin.com/post/96111319840/shifting-from-coinbase-to-chain). I believe Chain has also announced proofs-of-concept with Nasdaq and Gyft.\n\nBlockCypher provides some of the same services, and is a BoostVC company. I've heard great things about their service and love the team- we're planning to use them as a backup layer for blockchain / wallet notifications.\n\nPretty excited to see both of these companies grow.

Not unlike blockchain.info.\n\nThen they added [OpenAssets](https://github.com/OpenAssets/open-assets-protocol) support to that API and did some prototype for NASDAQ.\n\nNow they removed all the information from their site, I suspect they\'re doing private blokchains for enterprise clients like NASDAQ. This has absolutely nothing to do with Bitcoin, they aren\'t adding value.\n\nIt might be like Ripple, but more closed and more enterprise-y.': 3, 'From chain.com:\n\nOpen Protocol for \nAssets & Smart Contracts\n\nOur solutions are based on the open bitcoin protocol to ensure interoperability across systems and networks.': 2, "Thanks for breaking that down but I still don't see how all these hundreds of millions have been invested this year yet the price has remained constant. I understand it can be shorted but I am not hearing much of companies buying the actual Bitcoin on either end of the deal. Kind of makes me nervous but I guess that's irrelevant because I will continue to add lol. ": 2, "Investing in BTC technology does not equate to increased demand for BTC proper.  That is the ONLY thing that would drive the price north.  What you are seeing is Investing money being put into companies, with the expectation that these companies themselves will be successful - there is an implied notion that the price could increase because there would be increased demand for it, but that's not yet been the case - we still use cash to pay our mortgages and lend based on fiat lines of credit (its not possible to make a bona-fide fractional reserve system on an irreversible digital currency - think about it, could you loan and lend water if water itself was the unit of currency?  You couldn't because the water cannot be artificially increased or decreased like settings value in an account - its a muddy example because water is a consumable good and bitcoin/money technically are not consumable - they are simply tokens that represent the accumulation of value to be spent within a given society)\n\nedit:  I started to ramble off, but I was saying these things because right now - there are too few industries that take advantage of the benefits of BTC.  Its pretty much international remittances - the richest nations on earth see BTC as a crude competitor at best and don't take it seriously (yet [see how it's considered a property by the USGovt, but not yet considered a true currency?])  \n\nSince there are not very many demand use cases for BTC (beyond of course us individual users who like the benefit of holding our own money outside of banking systems), there is not a demand for BTC itself and thus the price remains flat.  All the action you saw between October 2013 and January 2014 was investors, speculating on the price and not wanting to 'miss out' on the opportunity to profit handsomely from the increased value - but those hands were weak, they only saw BTC as a means to earn more fiat - it does no good to cash out your BTC back into cash if the cash value is worth nothing.  Between 1800 and 1930 (one hundred and thirty years) the price of gold increased by only $2.  But if you just held onto your gold, it would have been worth $1200 today.  If you decided to sell your Gold in 1800, would your $19 from 1850 be worth more than $1200?  Nope, its worth [maybe $100](http://www.ebay.com/itm/1800S-BANK-NOTES-MONEY-ISSUED-BY-THE-STATES-14-TOTAL-/331646494901?hash=item4d37abe8b5) max.": 2, 'Chain is Bitcoin 2.0 company, they use bitcoins blockchain to transfer assets and ownership of anything that can be represented digitally. Nasdaq was one of the first to use chain to settle transfers of shares. They do use Bitcoin or a few Satoshi to do this. While they are more interested in blockchain than Bitcoin, bitcoins blockchain is the only secure and tried and tested one. Bitcoins gain is more in that it adds legitimacy to the technology and also requires transaction fees which will be very important in the future as block subsidy reduces.': 4, "Chain's business model is simple:  Make tools for building blockchain apps with no monetization strategy other than the chance of being bought out by a financial institution.  It's easier for banks buy out a company than build an in-house team to develop blockchain apps from scratch.": 2, "Blockstream uses Bitcoin, that's actually the whole point of their tech.": 6, 'Admittedly I had this question in my head too but decided against posting it here:  which means It\'s now on me to do the footwork and answer your question.\n\nChain.com is a tool for developers to build applications that use blockchain technology - at least thats what I gathered based on my random reading here and there, I\'ll go do the research now ... and ...okay they use the word platform a couple of times.  This means they are providing a \'solution\' which would be a combination of software and customer support to help Big businesses (ie nasdaq and citibank) implement \'their own\' blockchains but specifically targeted to run using bitcoin-like technology.  \n\nAccording to their terms and conditions page the basic tier of api service and usage is free, but that they offer enterprise level SLA "always on" capabilities too.  I think they\'re part of BoostVC based on the affiliation with fold and bitquick. They used RoR to build this - well at least part of it anyway.  The actual login link is [here](https://dashboard.chain.com/signin).  Using an explicit search on Bing you can also see they are [rolling their own block explorer too](http://explorer.chain.com/).  Here\'s their [404 page](https://dashboard.chain.com/404) for giggles.  The fact that I have to register to see their API documentation is definitely a dick move on their end.  For giggles let\'s go ahead and [add this link](https://github.com/chain-engineering/chain-ruby/commit/574f74571b8dcfc815dff82741a879e5ca7f5dd9) too. The long form of what appears to be the latest API docs was [cached and archived here](https://web.archive.org/web/20150414000703/https://chain.com/docs/v2), though a prettier version (which may be outdated) is [posted here](https://web.archive.org/web/20140807164401/https://chain.com/docs/ruby#introduction), for convenience.\n\nThat\'s cool, reading through the last link brings me to [this blog post](http://blog.chain.com/post/87136249186/how-we-keep-the-chain-api-secure).  Sifting back and forth between sections of the api documentation from the archived view shows that this is meant to be an api framework for developers to do bitcoin specific stuff within their applications.  So if you wanted to build a type of real time streaming service that requires funds available and transacted in a type of automated manner - chain.com api would allow you to accomplish this more easily.  I haven\'t bothered really diving into the ruby sdk source code because I don\'t care about much to do more research, but that\'s basically what this company is and is about.
