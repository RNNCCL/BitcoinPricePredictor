Sidechains can have different security properties, so it would be unsafe to just say "any coins burned on the sidechain can be immediately redeemed as new bitcoins", since a security failure on the sidechain would then allow printing unlimited bitcoins.

Future improvements in utility are a bonus.": 2, '> Bitcoin is an asset, it has a supply rate similar to that of gold and it happens to have great currency characteristics.\n\nBut it is not a *material* asset, or something that has material consequences per se.    A share of a gold fund is (supposedly) a title of property of some gold somewhere.  There is a system to record who is the current owner of that share and to securely transfer the ownership to others.  A bitcoin behaves very much like a share of a gold fund: it can be bought and sold, there is a system to record who owns it, and to transfer it to someone else.  Only that the bitcoin "share" does not stand for anything: it is just a title of property of a piece of nothing.\n\nBefore you mention other intangible properties: A digital video or music file can be played, a computer program can be executed, and it is the effects of those actions that make the file valuable to users; not the mere fact that they can be transmitted over the net.  Moreover, "ownership" of those virtual "properties" is not ownership of the bits themselves, but rather of the right to use them in certain ways; rights that are given by copyright laws and enforced by the police and courts.  When a publisher buys the right to a book or music, he isnot buying the bits, but buying the right to sell or stream the files.  Without those laws, the price of those virtual assets would be zero.\n\nUnits of *the* Bitcoin defined by the BitcoinCore devs may be limited to 21 million; but, since it is entirely virtual, there can be infinitely many bitcoins, similar or different; even infinitely many forks that differ from the Blockstream/BitcoinCore one by nothing more than a distinctive version stamp.  Just like land titles on Tatooine:  the planet may have a fixed area, but since it is imaginary, one could make similar land titles in as many other planets one would like.  \n\nEven the BitcoinCore version of bitcoin could have the 21 million limit lifted tomorrow. That\'s  because bitcoin is not "defined by math", but by a collection of *people* who run programs that use certain math -- but who may decide to change the programs tomorrow, who knows.  \n\n> why are you not convinced?\n\nBecause of those reasons too, that the general publci can see; and of several others that can be understood only with technical knowledge, or knowledge of the bitcoin "ecology", that the general public does not have.\n\n': 2, 'I have read the bitcoiners\' arguments a thousand times, literally.

Bitcoin must be *better* than other forms of payment in some sense.  Right now, i would bet that 95% or more of the purchases made via BitPay are from bitcoin believers, who buy with bitcoin in order to lift its price, not because it is a better way to pay.\n\n> long do you think it takes to make fiat transactions?\n\nEverybody knows the answer to that.

That is irrelevant to the consumer.

Likewise, once one considers the hassle of those conversions, bitcoin paymenst are much more complicated and time-consuming than the alternatives.\n\nAnd another reason yet is that bitcoin payments take too long to confirm.  In normal conditions the delay may range from 10 to 30 minutes or more. (Zero-confirmation payments may soon become infeasible.)

You could argue that an inherently volatile currency would be unpopular but supporters say this is a feature, not a bug and that volatility will be mainly upwards and will reduce greatly with widespread adoption.\n\nThe conundrum is that the bitcoin money supply can be increased although the number of bitcoins is fixed, by dividing each bitcoin into smaller units.

In the case of your untimely death, BitGo could facilitate access to the funds by removing the need for your approval upon the presentation of a death certificate.

Then you can email the private key and public key to your brother or uncle or whoever, then call them on the phone to tell them the password. That way if their email gets compromised, all they will see is the bip38 encoded private key, which they can\'t use unless they have the password, which you sent through another channel.

No single point of failure, and if you get burgled its useless to them even if they find it.\n\nThe only downside here is if you die, you take your password to the grave with you.

The test you propose will not be meaningful because any altcoin would have a network vastly different from bitcoin.  Just consider the huge industrial Bitcoin mines in China, for example: no altcoin has anything like that.  \n\nThe bad effects that the Blockstream devs claim for a 2 MB limit are subtle advantages that would be given to some miners located on one side of China\'s great firewall, or to more full nodes converting to SPV clients because of increased network bandwidth load.  These concerns will not apply to any other cryptocoin; not even to the Bitcoin "test" network that is used to test new versions of the sofware.\n\nAlso, the effect of 2 MB block limit on spam attacks are very easy to predict: it would make attacks 3-4 times more expensive for the attacker, and would clean up their effects 3-4 times faster.   The vulnerability of the current bitcoin network to spam attacks is a strong argument for increasing the block size limit.\n\nThe disadvantages of raising the block size limit are supposed to appear when the *normal* traffic rises beyond 150\'000 - 180\'000 tx/day (currently 120\'000 tx/day, increasing 5000 tx/day every month).

Bitcoin has multiple test modes for that.": 2, 'Increasing the block size LIMIT to 2 MB would have no discernible effect on bitcoin for the first 6-12 months or so.  \n\nAfter that point, with the current 1 MB limit, things would change radically: as the network gets near saturation,  there will be recurrent "traffic jams" with large backlogs of unconfirmed transactions, the average wait time will shoot up, the fees needed to get prompt service will also shoot up, and many clients will end up paying a lot more to wait a lot longer. \n\nOn the other hand, with a 2 MB limit, things would continue to evolve gradually like they have evolved in the past, for another 2-3 years at least.  \n\nTherefore, the most necessary test would be an altcoin whose capacity is just above its average *natural* traffic, to visualize the consequences of keeping the 1 MB limit.  \n\nAFAIK there is no altcoin anywhere near that situation; their natural traffic is minuscule, well below their capacity.  \n\nThe "stress tests" of last month (that saturated the bitcoin network with spam transactions, creating up to 200 MB backlogs), were not a good experiment either, because they used only fixed low fees: anyone who paid more than 0.2 mBTC/kB was not affected.

However, it\'s critical that bitcoin users are never convinced to trust BDFLs or anything else that can be compromised. Should all bitcoin users suddenly start using software with BDFLs, even multiple implementations with separate BDFLs, then those users can be trivially compromised through their trust in those individuals and projects.\n\n> The alternative is that every developer and every user is personally responsible for self-validation of the rules, checking for correctness and validity. Happy coincidence that this seems to match the strategy of operating the bitcoin network itself, which is to run a node that sees everything and validates all the transactions. Anyone is able to find an error in logic or flaw in the system rules, and they should make it known as widely as possible so that others may evaluate the evidence and consider which solutions preserve the important properties of the system. This is not a matter of majorities or minorities; these arguments should be true for anyone independent of who or what they are, or what level of unpopularity they may have.\n\n> Anything other than this is somewhat radical, and I am confused as to why others have been talking about "developer consensus". I suspect that the reason why they have been saying developer consensus is because they are talking about the Bitcoin Core project on GitHub at the moment. But the topic switched to contentious hard-forks already, which is not a topic of repositories but a topic of the blockchain and network; and in the context of contentious hard-forks it is clear why everyone individually must evaluate the rules and decide whether they the software is correct, or whether changes can trivially cause catastrophic broken hard-forks. These lines of reasoning should be true for everyone, and not merely true for one person but not another. Users, companies and developers must be aware of this, even though it\'s different from their usual expectations of how systems operate and are maintained. And it is important to be careful to not misconstrue this to others because it is entirely possible to unintentionally convince others that traditional and centralized models are safely applicable here.\n\nAlso, there has already been lots of evidence of why voting is bad besides all of the traditional problems of voting, like miner censorship of individual votes, votegrinding, votestaking, vote buying, sybil attacks, etc. Additionally, having a BDFL has the additional problem of probably needing a money transmitter license in every jurisdiction, so good luck with that I guess?\n\nHere are some questions you should ask:\n\n* What is Gavin\'s definition of governance? Does it only cover the maintenance of wallet software? Does it include blockchain network consensus?\n\n* When Gavin is talking with companies, startups, or regulators, how does he explain to them how bitcoin development works?\n\n* How is Gavin going to respond to pressure from regulators that want Bitcoin to have a governance model that they are more familiar with?\n\n* What is trustlessness? What role does it play in Bitcoin and in what areas?\n\n* Are there any forms of governance that Gavin would not be interested in?\n\n* What differences are there between Gavin and Mike\'s opinions regarding governance, if any?\n\n* Is Gavin willing to register for a money transmitter license in all the relevant jurisdictions if he was to become BDFL?\n\n* Does Gavin have a "warrant canary" arranged?\n\n* What are the steps of the current BIP process?\n\n* Some argue that Bitcoin\'s current governance model is incomprehensible or broken. What possible kinds of evidence to the contrary would be sufficient to refute this?\n\n* Has there ever been anything completely wrong merged into Bitcoin Core?\n\n* When Satoshi said "1 cpu = 1 vote", what did that mean? Was it a true statement? How do you count individual CPUs?\n\n* Not everyone is aware of this so it might be helpful for listeners: How does miner censorship of votes work?\n\n* Is there any way to measure a "majority" of Bitcoin users? Why does Sybil get to decide?\n\n* Branding might seem trivial, but in the event of a hard-fork into two separate networks, who gets to keep the Bitcoin name and brand? And what about all the current altcoins- why can\'t they claim to be Bitcoin too? Aren\'t they essentially copies anyway?\n\n* What would be the value proposition of a centrally managed Bitcoin? At what point or threshold do you think the value proposition would evaporate? or is there no limit ..?\n\n* Are you sponsored by ChunkHost or something?

For example, it is hard to agree on the history without agreeing on the rules.  And it is hard to believe in the value of a Bitcoin if participants cannot even agree on who owns which Bitcoin...\n\n---\n\n\nSomething which isn\'t stated by the authors but seems obvious to me is that we have decentralized "solutions" for the first and second consensus. Free market (exchanges, ...) is used to find a consensus about the value of bitcoin, and the Nakamoto\'s consensus allows to find a consensus about the valid chain of blocks.\n\n\nRemains the consensus about the rules. A decentralized solution has still to be invented but it\'s likely that it will be a very hard job. Some may think that a voting system (aka democracy) is a good solution but imho it\'s not. Because the matters are not just about ideologies or personal choices but are also technical. I mean, as a member of the bitcoin community, I\'m all in for allowing all kind of transactions without any censorship. I don\'t care if you pay for a house, for a second of video on streamium or if you\'re just a spammer. But as a developer, I know this is just a bad choice because it\'s technically impossible with current (and near future) technologies.\n\n\nFor months, we have all struggled with a same problem and it\'s not the blocksize limit, it\'s the absence of this decentralized mechanism allowing the social consensus. May be worse, weeks after weeks, we have started (collectively) to damage the fragile consensus which existed and which is required to keep bitcoin alive (see previous quote from the authors).\n\n\nBitcoin has a scalability problem and this problem won\'t happen in one year, it\'s happening now. It\'s the consensus about the rules which doesn\'t scale today, not the consensus about the state.\n\n\nIt\'s unlikely that someone will come up tomorrow with a decentralized solution for this problem. Until this "miracle" happens, we should all do our best to preserve the system as a whole. And the system is composed of 3 consensus.\n\n\nMy 2 satoshis': 1, "How about the Debian project?

Nodes that don\'t go along with the idea stay on the current network, while those who do join a new network. This has never happened in Bitcoin\'s history. It\'s not any old update, although it has unfortunately been portrayed as such.\n\nFor the most part, the users of the new altcoin must come from the Bitcoin user pool.

Perhaps eventually just maintaining the codebase and making optimizations gets old. There are more exciting things that may provide larger leaps in efficiency and optimality over just simply raising the blocksize cap, so in terms of career it is more exciting to steer things in that direction, and this can be justified practically by the fact that these alternatives would in theory be better if they could be made to work, and made to work in time.

Since even before blockstream was formed, they have been looking forward for network saturation as a positive development, if not a key element of their company\'s "business plan".  They would even reduce the blocksize, if they could, to make saturation happen now instead of in 2016.\n\nWhy exactly do they want the network to saturate, I can\'t yet figure out.  Perhaps that are simply eager to see the tools/toys that they developed for the "fee market" -- RBF, CPFP, various fee estimators -- get some real action (they are practically useless with an unsaturated network).  Perhaps they really believe that a workable overlay network will develop in six months, and all bitcoiners will choose to use it.  Perhaps they hope that transaction fees will rise to a level that will compensate the miners for the halving of their revenue.  Perhaps they hope that somehow the increased fees, frequent "traffic jams", and vulnerability to spam attacks will make the 1 MB network more attractive as a settlement network for large institutions.  Or perhaps they only hope that bitcoiners will stop using blockchain transactions, and move all their bitcoins to Coinbase and Circle, to finally fill those 2 million wallets...\n\nBut all these alternatives, and even their official explanations, require that they be blind to the consequences of saturation to the common user; or that they don\'t give a damn about it.

My dream is that someday we won't be able to tell the difference between government and the blockchain.\n\nI believe the blockchain can reinforce the delegation of democracy through election of representative officials as laid out by our nation's founders. Because the blockchain functions in real-time, the moment a representative begins to waiver from representing those who elected them, almost instantaneous blockchain voting would steer them back to representing their constituents or send them packing.\n\nMoved my post under this one but I don't consider government contracted via the blockchain to be anarchy.
