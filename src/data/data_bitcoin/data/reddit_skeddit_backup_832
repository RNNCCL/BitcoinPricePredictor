I have a strong background in CS so I guess it leaves a far stronger impression on me than it does on others.\n\nWhat Satoshi did was implement block halving at a machine code level, such that it didn't matter which piece of hardware, operating system, or programming language ran it, it would act identically. This meant no rounding errors (impossible in fact), perfect accuracy, completely unambiguous to debug if necessary, could scale seamlessly into the future if more zeros were added to increase bitcoin precision, etc.\n\nI remind you of what I first said about why he didn't implement incremental rewards:\n\n> Probably for the same reason he didn't make Bitcoin turing complete. Too complex, too risky, and not necessary.\n\nThis code needed to work perfectly on every binary system that ran it, and there are precious few coders out there that can write such code without it being complex, or being bug free. To attempt anything complex was to put at risk everyone's money. You may not realise it but there WERE bugs that forked the network that had to do with [verification of transactions going awry](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/CVE-2010-5139), so his caution with writing something rock solid, and simple absolutely trumped aesthetically pleasing curved lines unless there was a dire reason to do so. He absolutely made the right call.\n\nIn short, Satoshi erred on safety and stability, rather than quibble over aesthetics. Because let's be honest, if the system breaks absolutely no-one will give a fuck about how perfect the block reward curve is. You might not appreciate this, but history has already shown with the most drastic halving, almost nothing happened in the markets. So really it's a non-issue. Implementing incremental rewards won't help because everyone knows it will happen, miners will not overbuy hardware as they come close to the halving, others will buy up coins leading up to the halving to sell to fill the gap where miners don't have as many coins to sell any more.

If I could not find anything convincing enough then the next step would be to see if it is an idea people would be interested in, if so, then write the code. Why waste my time first.\n\nMy original enquiry was that I wanted to know why Sathosi coded it that way, I now have that answer. Im satisfied in that regard. Although I still know it is possible to have a more gradual system that would be universally compatible on all machines. It just a matter of doing it, the extra computation it would take is nothing in comparison to the rest of the code, especially with todays computers.\n\nThe only issue is consensus.

Too complex, too risky, and not necessary.\n\nLook at the code for halving, it is brilliant in not only it's simplicity but also in it's robustness. I challenge you to find any other alt that even dares to attempt to code something that both critical, and safe.\n\nOther reasons would likely include distributing the vast bulk quickly so that a natural market can form around the valuation, rather than leaving the markets in limbo due to the fact that there's going to be essentially an inflationary system driving down the price of existing coins in circulation for decades, or maybe even hundreds of years to come. Getting most of the coins out there sooner means that the economy can start functioning without the crutch of money printing, which is after all part of the premise for creating the system in the first place (in reference to the times article in the genesis block commenting on of bailing out banks). It also encourages the network to scale, because a lower block reward means miners are actually going to have to work for their pay, right now miners can (and have) mined blocks without including any transaction but their own. This has often been done to avoid orphans, but it's also because there is no reason not to. Lower block rewards means they'll have a *very* strong incentive to include as many transactions as possible with fees to justify mining in the first place, but making everyone pay huge fees to miners early in Bitcoin's life is not advantageous, so the block reward bears the brunt of those fees while adoption increases to a level where paying a fee will be relatively painless. It is a slow shift over many years where we move from a distribution phase where miners and users can get a fair distribution of the total coins, to a system that builds on the money distributed early to grow and eventually reach a self-sustaining system and economy.\n\nWe are still very much entrenched in the distribution phase, but in a decade's time Bitcoin will have evolved into a system/economy that doesn't really need a block reward any more and runs because it has lots of people using it, and contributing fees to compensate miners. The last halving was a non-event (there was lots of buzz about what would happen but the bottom line was it was priced in, miners saw it coming and prepared accordingly, the hash rate hardly even faltered), and I strongly believe something similar will happen during the next block halving 1.8-ish years from now.\n\nEdit: typos.": 7, "He didn't know what he was doing and he made a mistake.

It involves shifting the bits of a number to the right, one very simple operation, not even any math. Any other choice would increase the code complexity here significantly, and for such a crucial piece of the protocol, you could argue simplicity is very valuable here.\n\nIn theory I would be in favour of the change you suggest, but it would require some significant academic work, and some really extensive coding and testing, and for such a central piece of the machine, might not be worth the effort.": 3, "I don't think there is anything that can be done to get around volatility when you are building a new decentralized currency where the market cap MUST go from zero to a globally competing level.

I realize this information already exists elsewhere but when you're new to Bitcoin, having a WikiHow article holding your hand through the process can be useful. I don't know if WikiHow have standards around what article subjects can potentially be and whether this would be acceptable, but in the absence of this information (whether or not it's acceptable) I think it would be OK for people to go ahead and create these guides.\n\nPerhaps a guide on How to Decide How to Buy Bitcoin could even be useful, to take people through the decision process (since it involves considering ease of use, fees, speed, security, and possibly other factors).": 0, '> "Bitcoin is much more than just an alternative currency, it is a finite digital resource that can not be created or counterfeited so can only be obtained via trading with someone else."\n\nThat\'s just flat out wrong though.

My reasoning is that this is a "How To" about buying Bitcoin, and so (I reason) it follows that the introductory text should be an introduction to a "How To" about buying Bitcoin, not an introduction to Bitcoin itself.\n\nI am happy to author further additions to the article myself based on contributions from here (I\'ll also be happy when I see more editors have contributed to the WikiHow piece itself).\n\nAdditions proposed here (all very good points, thank you, it shows that my knowledge of how to buy Bitcoin in the UK is not complete as I had not considered these things) are:\n\nUsing ZipZap:\nI attempted to do this. I have not used ZipZap before but have heard of it. I found a press release on PayZone\'s website which indicates that users can by accessing www.zipzapinc.com register with the service before travelling to one of their retail locations. I can\'t find the registration option, is this service currently only available to its existing users? If not how does a new user register?\n\nUsing Circle:\nI attempted to do this. I have not used Circle before but have heard much about it recently. I registered a test account, and found I had to complete Mobile Verification. On the next page, there were further steps to complete before I would be allowed to purchase Bitcoins. I referred to their help guide and it was quite insistent (in my opinion) that users must hold a US checking account, is this the case? Or can a UK citizen use the service without this restriction? If someone could give me a walkthrough of the process I could publish it (or better, you can edit the Wiki yourself).\n\nI would like to explain much better in the article that methods vary on characteristics like price, speed, simplicity and ease of use. This is a large part of why I re-wrote the introductory text but I would like to indicate in the title of each method something to help guide people, like I have with the statement "Fees vary but are around 5-7%" with the ATM method. Could anyone suggest similiar text for the other items?\n\nThe Using a Trader method is one I have not used myself before, so did not feel confident enough to write a step by step guide on this. I am sure plenty of other users here have used Traders.\n\nAre there alternatives to BittyBot? I do not want to appear biased. I realize I have already created bias towards the GreenAddress wallet (do you agree?). I mention this wallet instead of others like Blockchain, Hive or Breadwallet because it works on Android, iOS and Desktop and the private keys are not held in a fully centralized fashion - I fully agree with Mr Antonopoulos\'s comments before the Canadian Senate that centralization creates points of weakness that do not need to exist, and that reduce the benefits the bitcoin protocol presents to end users.\n\nI have not added a warning to Method 4, Point 6, but I would like to decide how to add a more general warning about security, I have seen on other WikiHow articles that "Tips", "Warnings", and "Related Reading" can be added to an article at the end.\n\nMadcotto, the numbers after the names of services are hyperlinks. This is how WikiHow formats links; basically it\'s their decision not mine - I think it would be better for the word itself to be the clickable link, as is common elsewhere on the Internet. They give a second option, and that is that I can type https://www.coinradaratm.com and that will become clickable (and the https:// has to be included), but I cannot type CoinRadarATM and make that clickable (unless I am mistaken?).\n\nI have added Kraken and have also separated the Exchanges that do and do not accept GBP natively. I\'ve chosen to treat the Exchanges that only accept SEPA deposits separately as well, am I wrong to do this?

When you\'re sitting next to "experts" in the space (and they actually are experts), it\'s hard to believe that a technology that exists outside of the incumbent system and whose idea was, apparently, conceived of by one person, could contain within it all the innovations that current payments have been dreaming of implementing.

You as a miner are free to make smaller blocks and not accept tx's.  Limiting those factors for everybody else is the **opposite** of utilizing market pressure.  Market pressure is no size limit and miners compete and find the equilibrium for size versus fees.  If a 1TB block is mined, other miners can just not build on it and create a longer chain without it.  Additionally, storage capacity and price continues to get better and better.  The cost of storing the blockchain in 20 years is likely not going to be as prohibitive as you seem to think.  And again, you are free no just not mine transactions.  You are free to not use relay mechanisms which relay large blocks just as fast as smaller blocks.  The market will decide what it wants.\n\nYou give the satoshi dice example of blockchain abuse...  That's a good example.  What happened?  Most miners refused to mine them, so it took hours on average to get into a block, and users got annoyed by that and stopped playing on the site, which gave rise to just-dice.  That was a market-solved problem, without enforced blocking of satoshi dice.  Now satoshi dice has very few transactions and it's not a problem.\n\nWhy do you think enforcing artificial limits will drive innovation more than market competition without such restirctions?

All you would be able to "verify" is that one oligopoly provider transferred a large amount of Bitcoins to some other oligopoly provider.  Yawn.\n\nLook, there are two general options.  Either we make transactions cheap, and verification expensive, or we make transactions expensive and verification cheap.  You want the latter.

But the important point is that *the market can\'t do so* (there won\'t **be** a long run) if we artificially limit the ability to even make transactions in the first place.  The market for verification is **dependent upon** transactions.  It is therefore the secondary market.  Verification should be the premium service.\n\nAnd it\'s easy to envision this happening.  Someone will always keep the entire blockchain.  You can pay them for verification, if you want.  There\'s no way to game that setup.  There\'s no way to monopolize such a market.

If from connection X I want to send something to server Y then connection Y and X both know each others IP address. No one is private. So what Tor does is say route connection X through node A then from there to B and from there to C then arrive at Y.\n\n Now what happens is since each node/peer/connection only knows the IP of the previous no one peer can determine where the traffic came from or went to. Connection Y only knows the IP of connection of C and C knows only the IP of Y and B, B doesn't know the IP of Y or even of X because each peer only knows the IP of the previous. The whole chain isn't known. The longer the chain  the more secure. The less load on it the faster. \n\nNow essentially the way it works is there is the clear net which is the normal Internet. Then there is the Tor network. Exit nodes are the nodes that bridge Tor to the clear net. Relays are nodes that exist only within the network it's self and can not interface with what is outside of Tor only within it. Essentially they are what is vital to keeping communication secure and preventing a link from being established between nodes. \n\nNow what happens is that since an exit node interfaces with the clear net and the person who runs it is bridging other people's completely anonymous traffic then everything that passes through the  exit node is traced to it. So if someone tweets American Airlines saying I got a bomb and that traffic passed through your exit node the IP is linked back to you. A Tor relay on the other hand didn't interact with the clear net. It only interacted with other relays or exit nodes. So as such by running a relay node you never expose what traffic passes through you to the clear net as such there is no risk of cops showing up at your door but you still played a role in securing the network. An exit node is really both am exit and entrance to the Tor network. Relay nodes only exist within the network. \n\n\nAt least that's how I understand it.

Also note down the first public address of the Trezor 'Account' on paper. Exit the browser and shut down computer.\n\nStep4: \nLaunch [TAILS OS](https://tails.boum.org/) on a USB stick or CD (safer). \nConnect to Tor and go to [PassGuardian](www.passguardian.com) AND [BIP39 mnemonic checker](https://dcpos.github.io/bip39/)  \n\nUnplug your ethernet and disconnect from the internet.

Verify that your backup of the 7 shares decode to your trezor seed. Copy and paste each of the 7 shares from each USB stick, and paste them all into the 'Reconstruct' section of PassGuardian and decode the 24 word seed.\nIf that works, copy the decoded 24 word seed into the [BIP39 mnemonic checker](https://dcpos.github.io/bip39/)\nA list of public addresses will be listed, compare the public address you wrote down before rebooting to TAILS. If they match up, your backup can be relied upon.\n\nIf you have an offline printer and you can get it to work with TAILS then print out each of the 7 shares. If you don't trust your printer, then you can print them somewhere else, even public and insecure so long as you only reveal less than 3 shares. Use a different computer in a separate location to ensure you reveal less than 3 shares to the same IP. Use your vpn if you can, but not essential.\n\nAfter printing, shut down tails and make sure the internet has been disconnected the whole time.\n\nStep6:\nIf the threshold is 3 shares then any less than 3 reveals no useful information. \nPair each USB stick to its printout to give to trusted family members or friends. So long as you trust them to act in your best interest and not collude with 2 (perhaps unknown) other trustees then they can be trusted.\nKeep 2 shares for yourself (so you only have to call upon 1 trustee if you need a backup) but leave instructions that in the event of your death the trustees announce themselves to eachother and then discuss how to spend the money as detailed in your will which will require a majority vote of 3/5, leaving room for 2 trustees to be uncontactable. \n\nStep7:\nOnly connect to mytrezor through a VPN\n\nStep8:\nMove funds to the Trezor device through bitcoin mixing services, only accessed through tor.

An easy micropayment system would permit today\xe2\x80\x99s content creators, from major media companies to basement bloggers, to be able to sell digital copies of their articles, songs, games, and art by the piece. In addition to allowing them to pay the rent, it would have the worthy benefit of encouraging people to produce content valued by users rather than merely seek to aggregate eyeballs for advertisers.\n\nThis is something I advocated in a 2009 cover story for Time about ways to save journalism. \xe2\x80\x9cThe key to attracting online revenue, I think, is to come up with an iTunes-easy method of micropayment,\xe2\x80\x9d I wrote. \xe2\x80\x9cWe need something like digital coins or an E-ZPass digital wallet\xe2\x80\x93a one-click system with a really simple interface that will permit impulse purchases of a newspaper, magazine, article, blog or video for a penny, nickel, dime or whatever the creator chooses to charge.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThat was not technically feasible back then. But Bitcoin has now spawned services such as ChangeTip, BitWall, BitPay and Coinbase that enable small payments to be made simply, with minimal mental friction or transaction costs. Unlike clunky PayPal, impulse purchases can be made without a pause or leaving a trace.\n\nWhen reporting my new book, The Innovators, I discovered that most pioneers of the Web believed in enabling micropayments. In the mid-1960s, Ted Nelson coined the term hypertext and envisioned a web with two-way links, which would require the approval of the person whose page was being linked to.\n\nHad Nelson\xe2\x80\x99s system prevailed, it would have been possible for small payments to accrue to those who produced the content. The entire business of journalism and blogging would have turned out differently. Instead the Web became a realm where aggregators could make more money than content producers.\n\nTim Berners-Lee, the English computer engineer who created the protocols of the Web in the early 1990s, considered including some form of rights management and payments. But he realized that would have required central coordination and made it hard for the Web to spread wildly. So he rejected the idea.\n\nAs the Web was taking off in 1994, I was the editor of new media for Time Inc. Initially we were paid by the dial-up online services, such as AOL and Compuserve, to supply content, market their services, and moderate bulletin boards that built up communities of members.\n\nWhen the open Internet became an alternative to these proprietary online services, it seemed to offer an opportunity to take control of our own destiny and subscribers. Initially we planned to charge a small fee or subscription, but ad agencies were so enthralled by the new medium that they flocked to buy the banner ads we had developed for our sites. Thus we decided to make our content free and build audiences for advertisers.\n\nIt turned out not to be a sustainable business model. It was also not healthy; it encouraged clickbait rather than stories that were so valuable that readers would pay for them. Consumers were conditioned to believe that content should be free. It took two decades to put that genie back in the bottle.\n\nIn the late 1990s, Berners-Lee tried to create new Web protocols that could embed on a page the information needed to handle a small payment, which would allow electronic wallet services to be created by banks or entrepreneurs. It was never implemented, partly because of the complexity of banking regulations. He revived the effort in 2013. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are looking at micropayment protocols again,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe ability to pay for a good article or song could support more people who write things or make music.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThese micropayment protocols still have not been written. But Bitcoin may be making that unnecessary. One of the greatest advocates of using Bitcoin for micropayments is the venture capitalist Marc Andreessen, who as a student at the University of Illinois in 1993 created the first popular Web browser, Mosaic.\n\nOriginally, Andreessen had hoped to put a digital currency into his browser. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen we started, the first thing we tried to do was enable small payments to people who posted content,\xe2\x80\x9d he explained. \xe2\x80\x9cBut we didn\xe2\x80\x99t have the resources to implement that. The credit card systems and banking system made it impossible. It was so painful to deal with those guys. It was cosmically painful.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nNow Andreessen has become a major investor in companies that are creating Bitcoin transaction systems. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I had a time machine and could go back to 1993, one thing I\xe2\x80\x99d do for sure would be to build in Bitcoin or some similar form of cryptocurrency.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nWalter Isaacson, a former managing editor of Time, is the author of The Innovators: How a Group of Hackers, Geniuses, and Geeks Created the Digital Revolution, out this week.

You need the mining mechanism and actual creation of bitcoins to make it secure - so without that creation/distribution there is no blockchain - it\'s useless. You can\'t have half the system.\n\nMy take is that for many mainstream thinkers they need this stepping stone of saying, "well, the blockchain is cool but a new currency we can do without", before they can finally take that next step of realizing they go together. Eventually they have to figure out you can\'t have your cake and eat it.\n\nI don\'t find Amir very well spoken but I think he sees what\'s needed for true freedom of monetary exchange and understands that the establishment will fight it.': 3, 'You need to engage your brain then re-read that quote.': 9, "Worthless to him, but not worthless.

': 7, 'I have a great deal of respect and admiration for Amir. His contributions are legendary, and his rhetoric is the stuff of legends.\n\nThat being said, I think he\'s incorrect about this topic. Let\'s examine the arguments:\n\n> Chief scientist and former lead-developer Gavin Andresen is paid by the Bitcoin Foundation, while his friends are the big Bitcoin-corporations. So, naturally, he\xe2\x80\x99s more favourable towards their outlook of Bitcoin. And if you look at his actions and decisions\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n- Gavin Andresen suggested increasing the block limit.  \n- Gavin works for the Bitcoin Foundation.  \n- The Bitcoin Foundation is evil and works with big corporations.  \n- Therefore, Gavin is compromised because he is paid by them.  \n- Therefore, increasing the block size is bad.\n\nThis is an *ad hominem* logical fallacy.  \n\n> He talks about Bitcoin as a payments-innovation, he developed the payments protocol, and now he\xe2\x80\x99s pushing to increase the blocksize limit which would raise the maximum number of transactions on the network at the cost of even further centralization of mining. That is in effect in direct opposition to the idea of Bitcoin as a decentralized, private and uncensored system.\n\nWell, let us examine what Satoshi wrote in his whitepaper:  \n\n- 1st sentence in the whitepaper: "A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution."  \n- In the Introduction, Satoshi describing the drawbacks to the current payment system (i.e. a motivating factor for the creation of Bitcoin): "... The cost of mediation increases transaction costs, limiting the minimum practical transaction size and cutting off the possibility for **small casual transactions**... "   \n\nArguably, the value of the Bitcoin blockchain for non-payment purposes (as opposed to the Dogecoin blockchain or some other altcoin blockchain) is derived from the value the majority ascribe to it for payments.\n\n> [Is Bitcoin a payments innovation] No, it\xe2\x80\x99s not very good for that. The Bitcoin-network is currently subsidized through inflation, meaning transactions cost about thirty dollars each.\n\nLet\'s take a look at that. There are approximately 6 blocks per hour, or 144 blocks per day. The amount of transaction fees per day is ~$5,000 USD. This means a single block collects ~$35 using the figures I used (rounding up). At the moment, there are roughly 500 transactions per block. Now, does anyone want to compare the the accumulated bank fees in making 500 international payments via a bank? Take a local bank near me, [these are their fees for international money transfers](https://www.commbank.com.au/personal/international/transfer-money/fees-and-charges.html). If you didn\'t click the link, it\'s roughly $30 **per transfer**.\n\nBitcoin is a payments innovation, and a hell of a lot cheaper than the legacy banking system. Amir\'s statement is misleading.\n\n> If we want to make Bitcoin a competitor to Visa or MasterCard, we would need to increase the blocksize and centralize mining so much that it is basically the same as existing payments networks...  \n> If we increase the blocksize limit, the bloated blockchain would make it harder for people to run full nodes. You\xe2\x80\x99d need bigger hardware to store all of the required data, so in that sense it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t scale nicely at all.\n\nThis argument is largely based on the assumption that Moore\'s law will not allow us to catch up to the increasing HDD, RAM and bandwidth requirements of the blockchain. As a result, fewer people will run full nodes and the mining centralisation risk will increase.\n\nHonestly I can\'t comment on how likely this scenario is. However, experience suggests to me that these requirements will be trivial given future hardware and network innovations. Also, the vast majority of individuals who own Bitcoin do not run full nodes anyway... we arguably may be living in this centralisation risk reality at present.\n\n> But if we keep the blocksize limited people can always use Bitcoin for payments, they\xe2\x80\x99d just have to pay a bigger fee. This doesn\xe2\x80\x99t need to be a problem, in particular for the functionality of Bitcoin as an instrument to settle debts. The way banks work today is not that every transaction done between two parties is sent directly from one bank account to the other. Instead, they add up all transactions between the different banks, and settle the debts at the end of the day.\n\nWhile this is certainly possible, without question the original vision of Bitcoin was to enable direct peer-to-peer transfers without having to go through this process. I\'m also concerned that there is a centralisation risk in payments using this approach, where transaction fees are so high that **access** to these *settlement bitcoin payments* may be centralised.\n\nIn my view, a larger blockchain promotes both the poorest and wealthiest man a relatively equal opportunity to transfer wealth, without transaction fees being prohibitively expensive.': 11, "What is so difficult to understand about his vision?

For more, see:\n\nhttp://bitzuma.com/posts/who-needs-bitcoin-change-addresses-anyway/\n\nThe advantage of a deterministic wallet is that all private keys are derived from a single master private key.

It generates the addresses and looks for funds in the addresses. In 5 sequents with no funds in the address, it stops searching. That's how the wallet knows when to stop.": 1, 'I guess this depends on the wallet. Electrum is a deterministic wallet but you decide which address to use for receiving and can create more at will.': 1, 'Yeah, as you say, it creates new addresses, but the big deal about HD wallets is that all the addresses are linked together.  You can\'t tell that by looking at them-- so like blockchain analysis couldn\'t link one address to another (unless there were transactions between them), but under the hood, in the way they are generated, they are linked.  So you only need to remember one key, a "master key" and you can derive them all from that.\n\nSo an HD wallet is a way of having a safer and more privacy friendly wallet -- one that doesn\'t re-use addresses -- but which you can still access the money for all the addresses in it, by simply remembering one master key rather than the private keys for every individual address.\n\nFor example, let\'s say I had a private key that corresponds to a bitcoin address.  And then I take the sha256 hash of that private key and use it as a private key for a new address.  The addresses don\'t outwardly appear to be linked in any conceivable way-- but you know that they are linked by sha256 hashing.  So rather than remember two private keys, you can just remember one private key and then that you have to hash it to get the next private key.  So you can keep generating private keys that way, and still only need to remember the first key in order to be able to recreate them.\n\nThat\'s not quite how HD wallets work, but the concept is the same.\n\nHD wallets also have a neat property where if you want, you can prove that two addresses are linked like that, but without revealing their private keys.  You don\'t have to prove it, and nobody but you can prove it, but if you want to show that they are linked, you are able to do so.\n\nSo now imagine like a company that wants to give various departments a master key to control the funds for the department, and the ability to *verify*, but not spend, the funds from other departments.  Each department can get its own master key and derive private keys and addresses from that, and they can also derive the public addresses from the *master public key* of the other departments.\n\nSo there\'s all kinds of neat applications, only one of which is allowing you a privacy-friendly wallet that doesn\'t re-use addresses, and which can be backed up with just a single master key.': 1, 'Breadwallet is a GREAT HD wallet.

This is only a style of using one piece of unique information (a seed) to generate an endless stream of new addresses for easy backup and other purposes. How you use the addresses is up to your wallet\'s UI and your own personal tastes. Nothing stops you from using an HD wallet but still re-using the same one address for everything, although it would be quite strange and offer you poor security and absolutely ruin your privacy if anybody looks up your transaction history.\n\n2> The concept of "one address per transaction" was initially recommended by Satoshi himself and first made standard in the Bitcoind reference client (which is *not* hierarchical or deterministic, btw).\n\nThe idea here is as follows.\n\na> for every transaction you wish to receive, you just create a brand new fresh address to receive it.\n\nb> every time you send a transaction, there must exist a "change address". Here is why.\n\nEach time you get bitcoin from somebody, what you get is called an "unspent output". Imagine this like somebody melted down just the right amount of Gold for your transaction, and then let that harden into a chunk. They give you this chunk.\n\nAn address can have one or more (although just one is better when you can help it) unspent transactions. So an address is like a giant box where people can deposit one or more incoming chunks. \n\nWhen you go to spend from one or more addresses, you are forced to take one or more of the chunks found there so that together they are large enough to completely account for your transaction. For best security, as described below, you are better off emptying *all* chunks out of every address you tap into this way.\n\nYou melt them down yourself, to make new chunks. One the right size to send off to each intended destination address, and at least one chunk left over you still want to keep, but now it needs a home. This is called "change". (Then there are the miners, who take whatever dribble you voluntarily leave in the melting pot for them as their fee. Go miners! <3).\n\nIt is possible to always send the change back to the same address, but every time you spend from any address you reveal it\'s full public key on the network which while safe against today\'s cryptanalytic attacks will instead weaken you against potential attacks tomorrow, most notably taking you from quite-safe to completely-not-safe in the face of quantum cryptanalysis.\n\nSo when you direct any change to an entirely new, fresh, address you are helping to ensure that every address you dump anything out of (which instantly reveals it\'s full public key) gets completely empty and you never have to use it, or endanger any of the funds that get stored there, ever again.\n\nBitcoind and Bitcoin-qt do this for you by default, however they create each new keyset (private key, public key, address) absolutely from scratch entropy. They create 100 at a time, so every time you\'ve done at least 100 more incoming or outbound txn you have to make a new backup or you could be missing some of your active and important keys.\n\nHD wallets solve this among other problems by allowing one fixed seed to generate an endless stream of keys, so you never have to choose between simple backup strategy and safety against future cryptanalysis. :3': 3}, ('Time for AirBnb openbaazar', 0): {}, ('Digital currencies like bitcoin carry risk', 0): {'so does moving around paper (and plastic) with nose blood (ebola anyone?), cocaine, and ass sweat all over it': 0}, ('Bitcoin noob', 7): {'You link to your site a lot.
