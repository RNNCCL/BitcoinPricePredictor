The Block Relay is already much faster and more efficient than thin blocks, however it is not integrated into the Bitcoin protocol, it\'s a separate network. This would fold it into the Bitcoin network. I think it would also require more dedicated memory for unconfirmed transactions to achieve its speed: thin blocks is more tolerant to missing transactions but it gets that tolerance at the expense of speed. The Block Relay is also simpler and should be more resistant to DOS attacks that could target the Bloom Filter construction CPU time of thin blocks.\n\nAll these things are doing is avoiding the "send again" problem where first you receive an unconfirmed transaction and then you receive a confirmed copy when you download the block. This is most important for miners, because miners are in a race. The miners already use the Block Relay, so the advantage to the rest of the network would be some bandwidth savings.

For a normal situation where everyone is friendly, that isn't a big problem, but in Bitcoin you want to also think about abnormal situations where someone is abusing the system to force people into devoting more resources than they anticipated into the Bloom Filters.

Using the private key you can sign some data that can then be verified with the public key. This is how Bitcoin works - each transaction contains such a signature proving control of the private key for each input amount. But the same private key can just as easily sign arbitrary data, not just transaction data. So it is very easy to prove control of a private key by signing some message and the whole world can verify that with the public key, in the same way the Bitcoin network verifies transaction data.\n\nThat this has been drawn out into a fiasco is ludicrous. Every Bitcoiner signs tx data with every spend, and could easily sign any message in less a minute with any normal wallet software. \n\nThere is another similar type of signature being discussed as well. That is a PGP signature of file contents for the Electrum download. This is another typical use of signature - to prove origin of arbitrary data. If the Electrum file signature matches the known good one then we can be certain a good copy of Electrum was used, and not a modfied/hacked one. However, if someone can control download of Electrum then they can also probably control download of the signature file for it. So relying on file signatures requires much more care in this case.  \n\nAs for the Genesis block - that's another issue and not entirely important for this fiasco as any sufficiently early block is probably enough for demonstrating key control and identity, at least as far as I'm aware.": 2, 'Genesis block is first block ever created on the Bitcoin blockchain and it was made by Satoshi or someone authorised by Satoshi. Inside the genesis block is 50 bitcoin which were made as reward fir creating the block, this 50 bitcoin reward is known as coinbase. The output script for coinbase requires a related private to supply a signature to prove ownership of that coinbase and spend the 50 bitcoin. Genesis block coinbase cannot be spent due to the bitcoin code however, and it is unclear if that was by design or a coding error. Anywho, basically instead of signing the output script to spend the coinbase, someone can use the private key to sign a message of anyones choosing. So in this example if CW used the private key to sign a message that says "I am Satoshi" then you can be confident that CW has, or knows somebody who has the private key related to the coinbase in that genesis block.': 1, "It's likely that Satoshi mined most of the first blocks (and it is almost sure that he forged the genesis block) - so it is likely that he had possession of the private keys (which public keys and their addresses are derived from) from these early blocks. \n\nIf somebody proves (by signing something or by moving bitcoins) that (s)he has control of private keys from these first blocks, it would make it clear that that person is either Satoshi (or part of it) or that he somehow acquired those keys from Satoshi (by stealing, inheritance, or any other means - heck, Satoshi could even be giving keys to strangers to create confusion)...\n\n\n": 1}, ('The story of Bitcoin will be an amazing Netflix original series one day.', 3): {}, ('Need help removing unconfirmed transactions from a mobile wallet', 2): {}, ("Bitcoin 2016 : 'There Has Been an Awakening...' - Vinny Lingham", 45): {"Of course I want this to be true and I think vinnys analysis is sound, but it just always seems too much like wishful thinking.

The blockchain has, effectively, mapped the way the real world works onto digital space. \n\nWhat makes bitcoin money, however, is the fact that proof of ownership is definite and indisputable, this proof cuts through the fog of relatively with an absolute mathematical truth which possesses tremendous intrinsic value for this property alone. The fact that Wright can't prove definitively  -- not beyond reasonable doubt, definitively - that he is Satoshi proves that he is not Satoshi. The very essence of Bitcoin is proof of ownership. That is what makes the whole system work. If someone can't prove they own Satoshi's coins, then they aren't Satoshi. That is why Bitcoin is special. \n\nBut it is the fact that everyone is so confused that encapsulates the very heart of the modern Bitcoin question for society. Society is profoundly confused about bitcoin, particularly about how money can be made out of the internet when the internet is a world of relativity, conspiracy theories, half truths, and points of view! That money must surely be fraudulent, they reason, that money must surely be monopoly money, because everything on the internet is, to an extent, phony. \n\nOnce you realize that Bitcoin cuts through the chaos of the digital realm with absolute, indisputable, truth, you understand why Bitcoin is MONEY. Money that has intrinsic value because it achieves objectivity in the digital realm. When everyone gets that, there isn't going to be a power on this earth that can stop Bitcoin. \n\nIn my mind, in my opinion, the fact that some people believe Craig is Satoshi demonstrates they don't really understand bitcoin. And that is why, I think, they are inclined to want to pump it, to sell it, because they think Bitcoin is like anything else, a matter of perception, a mirage whose only value is in convincing people it is real. That is why I have been skeptical of people like Gavin and why I am not surprised that Gavin was not skeptical of Wright. ": 6, "BASE64 is not really encryption, is it?

And then Satoshi disappeared.\n3. The time zone [checks out](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=37743.0).

Physical cash is the same way, you can use it to make payments, and yet transactions with cash represent final settlement. \n\nThe issue becomes which one we should we prioritize as scalability becomes a concern. I would argue this represents the main division between big and small blockers, with the former wanting emphasize the payment network side, the latter wanting to emphasize the settlement side. \n\nTo explain why I think the small blockers are correct, the analogy we should be looking at is physical cash, since bitcoin is, after all, digital cash. With physical cash it is both a means of payment and settlement. However, if our system sought to transact solely in physical cash, rather than using dedicated credit-based payment networks, the whole economy would suffer from cash\'s greater level of friction, so no real advantage would be gained. Yet on the other hand, if cash was transformed into a form of credit to achieve less friction, it would cease to be a settlement system and therefore would lose all purpose. \n\nThat is to say, the real purpose of cash is to be a settlement layer. If cash didn\'t serve this purpose, it wouldn\'t exist. We use cash over, say, gold coins today for a variety of reasons that give paper money advantages over gold coins, and we will use digital cash for the advantages it gives over paper money, but this does not change the fact that you can always devise a more frictionless way to transfer money if you use units that aren\'t simultaneously attempting to represent final settlement. That is true of the paper legacy system, that will be true of the digital system as well. Credit works perfectly for payment networks precisely because it doesn\'t have the burden of trying to be a settlement system. The moment it does, there will be some other unit that, unburdened by this obligation, will be faster, cheaper, and smoother. \n\nPut differently, communicating to someone the promise to pay is infinitely easier than actually paying them, no matter what the medium, and since it is easier it involves less friction and ultimately makes for faster payment networks. \n\nCredit is not going away with the advent of digital currencies. It may take on different forms, it may be far more trustworthy and more quickly settled, but you still need units of exchange that are not burdened by actual final transfer of value. \n\nIf we overemphasize the payment network side of Bitcoin at the expense of its role as cash (i.e., as settlement) then eventually it will become centralized, and once that happens it loses its basic fundamental property: trust. Trust is the basis of all money and represents the soul of cash. "In God we Trust." Trust in the Bitcoin network is supreme over legacy monetary systems because it comes from a decentralized source, because it comes from math rather than people. If the system becomes centralized, then math ceases to be the basis of trust and the owners of the controlling institutions become the locus of trust instead. Since institutional trust is what we already rely on with the legacy system, Bitcoin would be offering no fundamental advantage. \n\nLegacy systems can switch to blockchain tech. What they can\'t do is offer a decentralized monetary system in which trust derives from math rather than institutions. You take that advantage away from Bitcoin, and it offers nothing that can\'t be offered by the old system. You keep that advantage, strengthen it even, and the foundation of trust that derives from that system will become the bedrock of the global economy.
