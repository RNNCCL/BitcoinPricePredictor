Every thing is 'relative' (just like energy -- E = MC2) :-].\n\nLet me explain. \nSay, the corner Haldiram Sweets Shop gives you 1000 HaldiCoupons (100 HaldiCoupons buys you a nice lunch), for placing his listing. Your BombayCoupons directory has a good idea of the value of these 1000 HaldiCoupons so you say 100 BombayCoins = 1000 HaldiCoupons in a contract on the Blockchain. \n\nNow, the Meena Bakery also places its ad and gives 20000 Meena Coins (100 Meena-Coins buys you a nice chocolate cake). As an intermediary working with Meena Bakery, you understand the value of those 20000 Meena-Coins as well and you decide that 1000 BombayCoins = 20000 MeenaCoins -- you create that contract on the BlockChain as well.\n\nNow:\n1000 HaldiCoins == 100 BombayCoins == 2000 MeenaCoins.\n\nSuch a transitive relationship can go on and on. In fact, this shows that someone holding 100 Haldicoins could exchange them for 200 MeenaCoins (by using BombayCoins as an intermediary). \n\nThe complexity of all this will be handled by the wallet itself and would be streamlined for the end-user. Every new relationship created anywhere in the network will allow it to relate to existing relationships. (Say BombayCoins adds more of these contracts, this will benefit both Meena and HaldiCoins and vice-versa).\n\nA value of any particular coin will be its 'relationships' on the Blockchain.\n\nThere's more to this. I've thought of a standardized way to create these relationships so that they are easily discoverable regardless on which Blockchain they are in. But this would be a good start.\n": 1, "Cool. I wanted to mention two more points:\n\n1. Try doing some back of the envelope numbers: Say you get 1000 merchants in and around you (which really shouldn't be that difficult), each giving you roughly Rs. 1000 worth of Ads (in their own coupons of course) on a recurring monthly basis.\n\nThat is Rs. 1000000 !!! (MONTHLY) worth of value on the network (JUST IN YOUR LOCAL AREA) - Now exponentiate that neighborhoods all around the world.\n\nWe can create a local [Groupon](http://www.groupon.com) which offers 50% - 90% off these coupons and sells them (for Bitcoins) to consumers who visit these merchants. \n\nIt's a win-win.\n\n2) However, the incentives don't just end there. When a merchant A's coupons ends back with him. It's not the same token that he first issued to 'Bombay Coupons'. When he issued that coupon to you, it was only redeemable at his wallet. Now, it came back with a contract with BombayCoupons and is redeemable by him and a 1000 other merchants. In affect, when a merchant accepts his own coupon which he used to advertise with, it creates a network affect allowing him to spend that coupon (once he has accepted it for services) to spend it at a 1000 other merchants.\n\nAnd this is just he start!!! :-]\n\nIf you decide to take on this project, I would love to help.... but like I said, I am half a world away from Bombay. I'm learning NodeJS, Angular and other open source technologies to try to do this in an environment that is most conducive to the open source world. \n": 1, "To actually simply this with the example you gave.\n\nSay Merchant A sells a beer for 10 ACoins. (You create a contract between ACoins and BombayCoupons in a certain exchange rate -- say 1 ACoin = 2 BombayCoupons).\n\nMerchant B sells beer for 20 BCoins. (Contract: 1 BCoin = 1BombayCoupon)\n\nMerchant C sells beer for 30 CCoins (Contract: 1.5BombayCoupons = 1 CCoin, etc, etc.).\n\nAs a network grows, the wallet behind the scenes will be able to do the interchangeability in milliseconds without the end-user knowing much about it.\n\nThere are a lot of 'boundary conditions' that will be handled when you are creating contracts.\n\nFor instance\nWhen you have a contract between A and B, and one contract between B and C. If you try to create a contract between A and C which does not equate to the transitive relationship of Ax = By = Cz, then the system will automatically warn you.\n": 1, 'When it will be happend': 1, "I love this idea. \n\nThree are some good videos out there that show how bitcoin plumbing works in concept, but it would be way cooler to see some kind of realtime animation of what's happening to actual transactions from start to 3rd confirmation of something.

People will be willing to issue their own coupons more easily to get free publicity than pay you the scarce FIAT money. That coupon however is only usable at Merchant A.\n\nNow you go to Merchant B, C, D...etc.\n\nNow your site issues it's own coupons -- 'BombayCoupon' that can be used at ALL the merchants that are listed on your online directory. Why, because you are able to control contracts for all of them..since you control all the coupons that you hold.  \nYou could sell these coupons for a discount on their face value ...

In other words, create a 'coupon' that has a certain expiry date.

Create a contract between two separate coupons. A coupon issued by A and one issued by B. \nA simple wallet that accepts your coupons that you issued (and any others that you have a contract with). The wallet would accept contracts that are n-levels deep. In other words, if the user of Wallet A issued coupons A and has contracts with B, he can accept A and B coupons... and if B has a contract with C, then A can also in real time accept coupons of C. \n\nEnd users will never really deal with unfamiliar and weird looking addresses and their namecoin identity will be attached to the underlying bitcoin/counterparty addresses.

The spent outputs aren\'t important, so discarding that information shouldn\'t be a problem.\n\n- All nodes and clients on the network force miners to mine this block by checking if it\'s been 30 days since the current Base Block was created. If yes, then only accept a new block if it\'s a new Base Block. Miners won\'t be able to proceed with standard transaction processing until the Rebasing process is complete, so they have to do it, even for no Block Reward or transaction fees.\n\n- Rebasing regularly means the chain will only ever be 30 days long, but the unspent history is still in the chain no matter how old.\n\n- We save storage space equivalent to the data required to store spent outputs. I don\'t know how much that is, but I assume it\'s a lot considering there are more empty addresses than unspent.\n\n- This would require the Base Block to have no block size limit. I\'m not sure how to prevent dust input spam from filling up the chain. Perhaps just don\'t include dust inputs in the base, therefore those transactions will be forgotten after 30 days. This may not be a big deal, since people sending amounts like 0.00000001 BTC are just spamming the network anyway.
