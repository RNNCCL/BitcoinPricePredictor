If hashing returns to the Bitcoin Core side (where the 1MB limit is still enforced) and that chain ends up regaining the status of being the chain with the greatest amount of work, then a block reorg on the Bitcoin-XT side will occur, causing all those blocks to disappear as if no hardfork had ever happened even.\n\nIt is possible that we see two persistant chains -- all that needs is following the hardfork for some non-trivial amount of hashing capacity (e.g., 25%) to return to mining against Bitcoin Core.': 2, "at first the 20mb coin will continue to accept newly minted 1mb blocks (so in a sense if u're mining for 1mb u are also mining for 20mb but not vice versa). \n\n\nhowever once a 20mb block is minted, 2 chains exists as the 1mb nodes will not accept the 20mb new block and will also not accept any longer chains that have any 20mb blocks in them. starting here 20mb and 1mb will each mine their own chain only\n\n\nif the 1mb blocks happen to form a longer chain, the 20mb chain will be discarded and move to the 1mb chain and this fight will continue again until the 20mb chain is sufficiently ahead that it would very hard for the 1mb to form a longer chain, most people seeing this will move to the 20mb chain.\n\n\n": 2, 'If, following the hardfork, miners stop mining Bitcoin Core, then essentially all the traction that Bitcoin had continues with the new protocol that allows blocks larger than 1MB.\n\nThis means your bitcoins are fungible on the new protocol -- there would be no difference between coins mined prior to the hardfork versus coins mined after the hardfork.\n\nIf, however, there is still enough mining on Bitcoin Core after the hardfork such that new blocks continue to be mined there (because there is a not-insignificant market value for those newly mined coins), then that means those who had bitcoins prior to the hardfork have coins that can be spent on both chains. \n\nIf you upgrade your existing Bitcoin Core to Bitcoin-XT you are giving your private keys to a client that uses a different protocol than today\'s  Bitcoin protocol.  If some altcoin were to try that their /r/bitcoin announcement would get downvoted into oblivion.   \n\nSo let\'s say the hardfork happens and the two sides persist.  The value of a newly mined bitcoin (BTC) might drop a little, or a lot, and the value of a newly mined Bitcoin-XT (BTX) will be some amount of value -- less than, equal to, or much larger than the value of a BTC. \n\nThe problem is when you first spend your bitcoins (BTCs) that you had prior to the hardfork, the recipient of those funds gets your bitcoin-xts (BTXs) as well.   Or vice-versa, you spend BTXs and the recipient gets your BTCs.    The only way to decouple the two is to taint the coin with newly mined coins from one side or the other.\n\nSo let\'s say you had 10 bitcoins prior to the hardfork.   Today those would be worth about $2,350 (based on today\'s $235 exchange rate.\n\nThen let\'s say that after the hardfork BTCs trade at $100 (down from today\'s ~$235) and BTXs (which you got "for free") trade at $120.   So you have 10 BTCs worth a total of $1,000 and 10 BTXs worth a total of $1,200.  Combined, the value of all your coins is $2,200.\n\nIf you don\'t want BTXs then you buy a few cents worth of newly-mined BTX (e.g., 0.0001 BTX) to an address created by Bitcoin-XT and spend the combined total of 10.0001 in a deposit transaction to Coinbase (or some other exchange that also gives you $120 each for them).  So you then use that $1,200 to buy 12 more bitcoins, or hold fiat, or whatever you want to do with the funds.\n\nIf you do want to hold some BTXs you could simply spend the 10.0001 BTX to a new address in your own Bitcoin-XT wallet.\n\nYour 10.0001 transaction included BTX taint which means the transaction will be rejected by those using and/or mining against Bitcoin Core.   Therefore you can still use Bitcoin Core at your convenience to spend those 10 BTCs, (though they are now worth only $100 each).\n\nThis spend-on-both characteristic only happens for coins that existed prior to the hardfork.    After that you likely would only receive tainted BTCs or tainted BTXs, and no longer need to worry about all of this.\n\nAlso, certainly there will be a simple exchange service where you just send your untainted bitcoins and they convert at the combined value, and return that value in your choice of just BTCs or just BTXs.\n\nQuite a mess, isn\'t it?\n\nIt is strange how so few people are considering (nonetheless preparing for) this potential outcome.': 5, 'so if we just dont do anything until the hardfork has been well received, would our coins just be automatically carried into the hardfork?

If she says yes, let's say you hit it off well and end up getting married and having kids, you move to a new city, get a new job... your life is very different. But let's also say there's a parallel universe where she said no, and your life continues on a different path than had she said yes. **In both parallel universes, your lives are exactly the same up until the moment that fork occured**. It isn't until that yes/no decision on that day that your life paths begin to diverge.\n\nThe same sort of thing happens when Bitcoin forks. One day a block that is bigger than 1MB will be produced, and there will be a yes/no decision on whether that block is valid, and now we have two Bitcoin blockchains existing in parallel.

': 6, 'I\'m not sure where I stand because I have some concerns about the implications of the change while at the same time I see the limitations of the system if we do not make a change.  I do have an analogy and some other random thoughts that might help explain my concerns and perhaps those of others.  Preface, I don\'t think I\'m qualified to predict how any of the future scenarios will play out as this is clearly a very complex system.  Bitcoin is a unique experiment so we can\'t draw completely or reliably on history to help us know for certain what the future would hold should any sort of change be introduced, or perhaps should nothing change (regarding this particular issue).  For those reasons I don\'t feel strongly about any scenario, but I do have a healthy fear about the future of Bitcoin since we seem to be coming to at least a philosophical fork in the road.\n\nHere\'s my analogy: Presently in the medical realm there is so much change happening thanks to the convergence of computer-tech, bio-tech and nano-tech essentially bringing Moore\'s Law to the medical system that some people are choosing a sit and wait position if they are diagnosed with a condition.  The example I\'ve heard of (I\'m not giving medical advice here - I\'ve just heard about this) is potentially cancerous colorectal polyps.  The theory is that you can act immediately or you can wait and see because they are slow to develop.  "Around the corner" there may be developments in either the accuracy of diagnostics or treatment such that your odds of survival or the costs (monetary, stress, etc.) such the normal risks of waiting, like the advance of the cancer, are counter balanced (in some people\'s opinions) by the benefits that "may" be right around the corner.  I won\'t got too much into the specifics, nor am I any sort of expert about it, I have just been intrigued by this concept since it\'s rather unique to our present.\n\nWhat this analogy boils down to in a practical sense is a choice between risks of different types.  Risks of action and risks of inaction.  I think we are in the same situation with Bitcoin.\n\nIf we don\'t act, either the number of transactions that the "backbone" network supports is limited such that alone it cannot compete with the likes of the credit card companies.  Or perhaps fees would have to go up reducing the competitiveness of the network, for "backbone" transactions.  Benefit: the system is at least software-wise currently cohesive, it works and has been used to transfer billions (in USD) of wealth around the globe and is fulfilling at least part of it\'s mission to liberate people from the manipulated fiat systems and without the intervening and manipulative hand of (corrupt) "central regulators".\n\nIf we do act, we may solve the scalability and fee problem, though we risk fracturing the system (albeit this appears to be happening at least mentally now).  Unlike the do nothing scenario, we also may affect the network in ways we cannot yet predict.  For example if the costs of running nodes changes significantly due to bandwidth cost or decreased mining incentive.  We also may introduce other issues to the system, not unlike how surgery can introduce other complications like new vulnerabilities.  \n\nThe summary being (IMO) that the take no action route has known limitations but is currently "stable" and serves a significant and important purpose despite it\'s limitations.  Some of those limitations can be supplemented (off-chain transactions) while those supplemental systems introduce issues, they are likely not existential.  The take action route may solve the transaction limit problem and the need for increasing fees but introduces new variables, for example potentially eliminating the current fee model (I\'m not 100% sure on this, but if the block could expand dynamically to any size then doesn\'t that eliminate the need for market driven fees?).  Also, by making this change and forcing a vote so the speak we are potentially forking the network which clearly proposes an existential risk to the system.  That said, both sides are acting, the first if only by inaction so I\'m not leveling this at the folks suggesting we need the change.\n\nAnyway, not trying to stir anything up or sound at all authoritative as I definitely am not qualified to predict where any of these paths will lead.  I do see the benefits of both and the concerns of both sides.  I think we may also need to consider that perhaps a 50/50 fork would be great for the system and/or inevitable.  Perhaps it might result in a bitcoin1.0 for the folks that are concerned about change and a bitcoin2.0 for folks that want to swap change :).  Though I think the cost might be great in terms of the faith of the general public and the uncertainty that would produce if that were to happen.  Perhaps that\'s what needs to happen as part of an evolution in this new unique space.?.?\n\nI hope this helps the dialog, and in any case I hope we can respectfully discuss the pros and cons, risks and rewards, continue to test the system, innovate and experiment with new solutions and keep this community in tact and pushing forward powerfully into the future.': 9, 'So what you are saying if we skip the debate bitcoin and thus people involved will be better off?

One of the main motivations cited for "creating" viacoin+clearinghouse was that the BTC core devs are too resistant to change and also apparantly hostile to certain uses of the blockchain (mostly because OP_RETURN was supposed to allow for 80 bytes of data, but luke-jr slashed it down to 40 and there was a huge fuss about it). So the solution was to take Counterparty, fork it and have it run on a block chain with much shorter confirmation times, which makes the Counterparty decentralized asset exchange less clunky (as opposed to BTC with 10 minute block times).\n\nWhen Viacoin was launched, they did the whole usual "this is the future of digital currency!" and "we are better and more awesome than bitcoin because reasons" marketing BS that we see all the time. They also did a pretty big pre-mine and raised something like 600+ BTC out of it. One of the first things he did with that money was hire on Peter Todd to specifically develop the "tree chains" concept, which of course never amounted to anything, but now Peter has the title of chief scientist of viacoin, even though he mostly just works on bitcoin core. Hiring him always seemed like a PR stunt more than anything, IMO. \n\nOne of the reasons the whole pre-mine sale seemed shady was that he literally just copy and pasted the code for Counterparty and Counterwallet, changed the name and maybe a couple other variables, played it off as his own protocol (ok not exactly, but sure seemed like it coming from a perspective of somebody who doesn\'t already know about counterparty), and then just like that received hundreds of BTC. Meanwhile, counterparty raised no money at all, and even burned some of their own funds while bootstrapping it. Now, a year later, AFAIK sweet fuck all is going on with Viacoin and I am sure that most if not all the pre-mine sale funds have been burned through, mostly on Peter. \n\nThere is probably a whole lot more to it that I am missing': 16, ':)': 1, '> Forking can not be an option\n\nBy "forking" I suppose that you mean an incompatible protocol change that requires version-stamping transactions and blocks so that it *potentially* splits the coin into two independent altcoins.\n\nIt seems naive to me to expect that there will be no more such forks.  The protocol is not a divine creation; it has several known flaws that just have not had time to kill it, and surely more will be discovered in the future.  Forks will be necessary to fix those flaws, and to improve the protocol so as to remain competitive with future altcoins.  \n\nInstead of fighting forks, bitcoiners should worry about how to make them happen in the least traumatic way possible.

Everyone here (except altcoin shills and buttcoiners -- thanks Gavin for mentioning this possibility in another comment) has a common objective: see Bitcoin succeed. Some want only on-chain method of success (hence fewer, high-value transactions), while others see mass adoption as the only way Bitcoin will truly grow and become useful which requires mostly-off-chain approach (trustless ideally like Lightning, but until then, auditable-trusted as a crutch like Amiko Pay or Strawpay).\n\nRe: Consensus + \'Forking\' with XT\n\n* If we assume the community is not monolithic (and it isn\'t), then we want to generate precedent to act in a way that generates maximum consensus. Forking can **not** be an option; how is forking *better* than dealing with a scalability crisis when it emerges? So, the XT idea seems \'undesirable\' to put it lightly. One simple way to generate consensus on an ambiguous issue with opposing priorities like this one is to simply wait until there is a true clear problem to solve. So, rather than now, maybe wait 6 months and if transaction counts continue to climb upward and start causing issues, then an emergency patch (which can be made ready now, in advance) can be implemented "within days" if need be, with full consensus.\n\nTo move forward and achieve consensus, it\'s clear we need real, peer-reviewed research on the blocksize increase debate, with a scientific/organized/objective approach to establish the facts. Of course, this research-gathering process needs to prioritize and be time-limited, so that it does not stretch on for months or years:\n\n* Historical/Current/Projected increases in demand (in terms of TPS) on the Bitcoin network, and how the current situation deals with it and scales.\n* For future scaling, which size & why.\n* Static increase, percent increase, or algorithmic increase in size, and why.\n* Projected impact on nodes (+ other decentralization metrics).\n* If/how much # of nodes actually matters, in keeping Bitcoin decentralized.\n* A true delving into and understanding of Satoshi\'s view and its rationale (objective merits/demerits of the view), as he is the architect of Bitcoin and deserves extra recognition for that. i.e. Supposedly, he expected the network evolve into few, high-powered nodes and was fine with that.\n* The exact \'emergency patch\' to increase blocksize in case of \'emergency\', the exact triggers that will enable the patch (as decided by objective measures), and the timetable in which it would be expected to be implemented.\n* A real scalability roadmap to address the core issue here of scalability (Lightning, Strawpay, Amiko Pay, Sidechains... and/or simply ad infinitum increase in blocksize?) that is backed by thoughtful, peer-reviewed research. We need a real, transparent plan of development (not just 1 person being assigned to Lightning -- how is it supposed to be completed in any reasonable amount of time?). There should be consolidation of resources, where helpful, among the different approaches. Right now, it seems we have independent, disjointed teams (Straw, Amiko, Lightning), some with funding and some without funding, all with varying ETA\'s (Straw -- reportedly "a few months", Amiko -- "few years with current state of no funding", Lightning -- unknown, Sidechains -- unknown).\n* etc. etc.': 20, "This discussion is immature across the board, with todd on twitter, but across the bitcoin community.

I doubt that we would ever reach these volumes on the blockchain but Bitcoin will be able to support it 20 years from now as long as the 40% yearly bandwidth growth is feasible for the next 20 years.\n\nSo the standard this sets is quite ambitious. More importantly, and I think this is the point you might have missed, this 40% yearly growth is the maximum of what is technically possible. If growth would be faster, centralisation would reach unhealthy levels. If growth outpaces bandwidth costs, the number of nodes can be expected to drop even faster than it does today, eventually to dangerously low levels. Already the number of nodes has been dropping to only a few thousands.\n\nIn other words, faster growth simply is not possible without putting the decentralized nature of Bitcoin at risk.

The lower your orphan rate, the greater your profit (all things being equal).  When you increase your risk of being orphaned (compared to other miners), you lose profits.  Centralized pools can minimize orphan risk because they have significant hashing power and will know about their own blocks first without any propagation delay.  This allows them to continue mining on their own chains before anyone can validate.\n\nWith closer blocks, the propagation delay remains the same, but the expected time between blocks decreases.  This also increases the likelihood that a block will be found during propagation delays.\n\nMiners that point to smaller pools will lose out, and will have a great incentive to point to bigger pools, even if the pools implement policies that are something they disagree with (blacklists, etc...).

I\'m not suggesting that we should make Bitcoin a centralized system in exchange for getting low fees. \n\n>It\'s possible that an alternative exists, but it suffers the same trade-offs of Bitcoin, barring some breakthrough in blockchain technologies.\n\nRight. I\'m imagining Bitcoin2 to be exactly like Bitcoin, except that it has larger blocks. So it would just pick a different point on the centralization / low fee spectrum. (I guess I should have called Bitcoin2 Bitcoin Xt instead). My intuition is that 20MB blocks will not significantly centralize Bitcoin. Assume that it has no effect on centralization. My main point with my earlier post is that Bitcoin2 / Bitcoin Xt has a good shot at taking over in that case even if it starts with a totally new blockchain and with very little mining support. \n\nThe "if fees are high, that means Bitcoin is valuable, so we shouldn\'t worry" argument fails because it ignores how a low fee ccy that isn\'t significantly different in centralization risk could slowly take over once it gets a foothold. Of course if all low fee ccys were significantly more centralized, then Bitcoin would never completely be taken over.\n\n>I\'m not in the camp of "don\'t change it ever", but "this isn\'t a crisis, so let\'s not treat it like one".\n\nAgree it\'s not a crisis. \n\n>You cannot scale without making trade-offs. If the trade-offs exist, Bitcoin would offer something unique.\n\nIf the centralization risk of 20 MB is miniscule, but fees drop by 10x, then although there is technically a tradeoff, Bitcoin might in practice offer no significant value over Bitcoin Xt. On some points on the spectrum, moving a little bit to one side may trade off a negligible amount of one value for a huge amount of the other. In this case, a competing ccy that picks a different value on the spectrum can just replace another ccy completely.\n\nI mostly agree with that second article of yours, but as I describe above I don\'t think it speaks to the fundamental nature of the tradeoff. Yes, if fees rise than many low value transactions will be pushed off the blockchain, and we\'d be able to live with it if we had to, but lower fees would still be nice if we could get them without giving up anything significant. \n\nTo put it another way, why don\'t we reduce the blocksize so that Bitcoin can only handle one tx per minute? That would provide stronger protection against centralization. People who don\'t want to pay fees high enough to make it into the new smaller blocks can just use off-chain solutions. The correct objection is that we\'d be sacrificing a large amount of usability for a trivial increase in centralization protection. \n\n': 3, 'The dollar supports more transactions than gold, too.\n\nOver in /r/dogecoin they\'ve talked about this.

Bitcoin2 then starts to get more usage --> more security --> it becomes attractive to people doing slightly higher value transactions --> more usage --> more security, etc.\n\nIn this way, once Bitcoin2 gets a foothold with low value transactions, it could climb to becoming dominant for higher and higher value transactions until it's security is on par with Bitcoin's, at which point no one who does transactions would have any reason to use Bitcoin vs. Bitcoin2.": 4, ">From Gavin's appearance on Let's Talk Bitcoin, it sounds like the reason he wants to do it soon is that lots of people take a super long time to upgrade\n\nIt couldn't be done on a dime, but there's no reason to make it take a year once consensus is formed.": 1, 'I was simply pointing out that the community is marching in the streets over a block size increase and devs raking their heads for a solution.

People leave keep their money in bank accounts indefinitely and send and receive payments there.\n\n> Each top-up is a blockchain transaction, correct?\n\nAgain I find the checking account analogy useful. If you want to deposit or withdraw "cash", i.e. bitcoin that isn\'t in a channel, then it would take a blockchain transaction.\n\nOn the other hand if someone sends you a "check", or a channel payment, that could increase your "account balance" without a blockchain transaction.\n\nThe difference, though, is that without blockchain transactions the size of a channel stays constant. The potential amount you can pay the hub plus the amount the hub can pay you doesn\'t change.\n\nIf you make more payments than you receive then your side of the channel will run out. You would need a blockchain transaction to top up your side of the channel.\n\nIf you want to change the size of a channel then you need a blockchain transaction.\n\nIf you send the same amount as you receive, and you\'re happy with the size of the channel then you could go a long time without any blockchain transactions.': 1, "1.

But yes LN could let us scale a few more orders with current block size.\n\n3. Who knows what LN fees will be.  Esp once SEC starts mandating compliance to the LN money transmitter companies.\n\n4. LN essentially aggregates small txns.  Presumably because blocks are full and so txn fees are very high.  So hobbyists *could* use the blockchain but fees would be so high it would be impossible in practice. \n\n5. Bitcoin is not changed but ppl can't afford to use it.  But colored coins etc can't he sent thru the LN because it aggregates sends.  So the coins you send are not necessarily the exact coins received.

So, your comparison doesn't really prove anything.": 3, "> We set up a chain of transactions such that I pay Coinbase, Coinbase pays Bitpay, and Bitpay pays you\n\nIt's great you've cut out the middleman like that.": 1, "A lot of people already use Coinbase, Bitpay, Changetip, etc. as bitcoin middlemen. Using middlemen to take transactions off the blockchain can be cheaper, more efficient, and more convenient. It even has the potential to be more private, since you aren't putting your transactions in a public and permanent record that everyone can view and analyse for the rest of time.\n\nThe risk in using a middleman is that it adds an extra person you have to trust. But Lightning Network payment channels are trustless. LN hubs can't steal your money. The worst they can do is keep it tied up for a little bit until the channel times out. Then you switch to another hub (of which there can be thousands) and go on your way.": 1, "A single miner can deny your transaction, but cannot stop other miners from adding it.\n\nIn LN, if a node don't want to relay your payment, you can choose any other route through the LN to the recipient. The idea is that there should be enough intermediaries such that you can transfer payment without being censored.\n\nSo yes, it is basically the same, from a censorship-resistence point of view.": 2, "I am not opposed, its just that its not a solution because the lightning network does not secure bitcoin once the block reward has gone. Satoshi designed it so that increasing transactions would increase the amount of microfees to be had by miners, thus increasing security overtime as transactions increase. Therefore there's actually a crucial need to increase transactions so fees can start taking over the block reward. All off chain services are not contributing to the security of the network.": 16, 'Never heard of him, why not contact him on twitter?': 4, "Your argument is that miner fees have gone down as bitcoin grew more popular. However, your argument is flawed, because it's comparing two things over a much different time. In other words, correlation does not prove causation.\n\nThe reason correlation doesn't prove causation is because of conflating details, like the fact that the default fee is now 100x lower in terms of BTC price. There are many more conflating details as well: like the larger amount of size in blocks for free transactions, or just the fact that 2 years later, the population of bitcoin users has changed.": 2, '> They\'re just not proportional to usage.\n\nBut they\'re proportional to the number of users. If my LN service settles once a week and 7 users sign up, I can stagger them to settle one of them every day. But if 604793 more users sign up. I would have to settle one user every second.\n\nSo we\'re still just kicking the can down the road, just in a different way... not to mention we\'re also introducing large amounts of complexity to a process that is already complex.\n\nExplaining to a newb to write down their BIP39 phrase, oh but don\'t screen cap it... oh and if you add an optional passphrase, no wallet will tell you your passphrase is wrong, because every passphrase is right and creates a hidden volume, oh and by the way you need to print pieces of paper with QR codes to store bitcoins securely...\n\nImagine how things will be with Lightning: All of the above PLUS "oh and by the way your browser/app will store these things called nLockTime transactions when you open a channel and these are crucial to keeping control of your own funds so don\'t lose them, but you will prolly be using multiple hubs at once, and if your device explodes you won\'t have your ticket to holding the hub accountable anymore so be sure to back it up with a USB or in your email drafts or evernote or something."\n\nI\'m sure they\'ll iron out details and figure out ways to make all this super easy while still being trustless... but they haven\'t.\n\nIf we sit on the current network for 3-5 years while they work on sidechains or what have you, then Bitcoin will have lost pretty much all value and come around full circle to being a niche technology with 100kb blocksize averages. Then Fedcoin / Ripple-bank will take over because they scale.\n\nA lot of people say "boohoo, 20MB people are afraid of their investment losing value!" but imo I think the bigger threat is "while Bitcoin is in \'oops transaction backlog of 50,000,000 transactions, estimated 1st confirm for 1 BTC fee ($5) = 2 days\', Fedcoin / Ripple-bank can render Bitcoin irrelevant with a scalable centralized network."\n\nThat\'s what worries me most. Along with "What if the federal reserve just printed money and used it to buy OTC bitcoin by the busload and ran a spamming attack like the stress test the other day... except 24/7..." but that\'s a little more far fetched.': 7, 'Not really.

If every person on earth made 2 channels per year with *unlimited* transactions we would only need 133MB blocks with LN. [Source](http://lightning.network/lightning-network-paper-DRAFT-0.5.pdf)\n\n3. LN fees will go by supply and demand. Premiums could be paid to use channels with no restrictions. It will be profitable for many people to run anonymous businesses to operate channels blacklist free since they can generate fees. These businesses will have competition and drive fees down.\n\n4. LN itself by moving tx's to sidechannel will reduce blockchain bloat and bring fees down. The only time micropayment channel tx's have to hit the network are if there is a problem or dispute, otherwise there would be no reason to use the blockchain. This reduces on chain tx's, reducing overall fees.\n\n5. LN should make bitcoin *more* affordable by reducing on chain tx's, thus reducing tx's miners have to process, thus reducing tx fees. Other protocols that have been developed on existing technology will not be affected by what others do with micropayment channels, they can stick with what they are dong (although they might find a cheaper way to do it with LN).": 1, "> Channels can be open for years without being settled on the blockchain.\n\nWouldn't that require funds to be committed to the channel for years?\n\nEach top-up is a blockchain transaction, correct?": 3, 'OK. I can see how a payment channel would work with a regular stream of micropayments or "minipayments".  I am not sure how it would work with, say, buying plane tickets.

It will require 20MB blocks anyway for global scalability. \n3. It will have its own fees.\n4. No one will run full nodes if they can't issue txns on the blockchain anyway.

They\'re just not proportional to usage. One benefit of this is that these activities can pay fairly high fees without resulting in large overall net fees for users."': 1, '> I find it useful to think of a channel like a checking account. People leave keep their money in bank accounts indefinitely and send and receive payments there.\n\nI understood that a payment channel is restricted to two participants only.  In that case, it would be like opening a separate bank account for each person that one wants to pay.  Leaving money for years in such accounts would not be acceptable.\n\nCorrect me if I am wrong, but a payment channel is worth using only when one expects to make several payments to the same entity in a relatively short time.  For payments that are more spaced in time (such as salaries, groceries, etc.), or whose recipient may change unpredictably  (such as buying plane tickets), payment channels have no advantages over direct blockchain transactions.': 1, 'https://medium.com/@octskyward/the-capacity-cliff-586d1bf7715e': 2, 'It will rely on intermediaries the same as Bitcoin relies on intermediaries in the form of miners.\n\nIt may be complex, but so is Bitcoin.\n\nAll protocol changes required are soft forks.

But right now it is just that: a theory.  It relies upon entirely different and untested trust and security models.  Which can be OK, but they are just that: untested.  \nOpening a channel, top up a channel, merchant settlement and users withdrawing excess funds are blockchain transactions so congesting on the blockchain can be decreased but not eliminated by LN.  If you know the amount you are going to send and only send it once, it makes no sense to use LN, it would actually be more blockchain bloat.\n': 13, "Why is this bullshit false dichotomy being upvoted?

They don't have to go up they have to increase in volume. In order to determine you would need medium dollar value of all fees during a years period then compare it to a later years period where the amount of transactions where double. But this too wouldn't be accurate because whilst block reward is significant fees can be artificially low.": 3, "We need both. LN looks great, but I guarantee you that payment channeling will become a business model unto itself, and if we allow the block size to relegate smaller transactions to LN, we'll see bank-like businesses gain a foothold channeling micropayments and charging a fee for the privilege.": 1, 'The block reward makes fees insignificant once the block reward becomes insignificant fees will hit a floor and volume will indeed increase total reward.': 1, 'But an implementation is being worked on and it is probably only a matter of time before we see a working proof-of-concept.

True, but it could be implemented before the winter 2016 predictions of blocks being full.\n\n2. Where is the proof of this? If the majority of tx's are happening on payment channels and only hit the blockchain if there is a dispute or parties wish to leave the channel, 1mb should be sufficient until global bandwidth is such that not only regulatory regimes are able to provide that level of bandwidth.\n\n3. Yes but they will be significantly lower than blockchain fees, otherwise people will use the blockchain or be fine paying the fee for a timely tx (which would be less than sending every single tx through 20mb blocks).\n\n4. Why would nodes not be able to issue tx's? Blockchain tx's would work the same as they do now. With lightning networks you can engage in a payment channel and at any time the tx's can be moved to the blockchain, validated by nodes (by either party- there is no central control in these side channels). Centralization will be less because people can choose to engage in these payment channels and cryptographically have the option to take their money and go home or to another channel, even if the channel is acting malicious. You still have the options as per the contract to redeem funds to the blockchain regardless of the payment channels support. This model offers much less centralization than moving all nodes to data centers in countries that have high bandwidth available (usually regulatory regimes).\n\n5. What is your argument for this? How does lightning network fundamentally change bitcoin from the way it is now to prevent those features?": 1, 'Nobody is opposed to Lighting as far as I can tell.
