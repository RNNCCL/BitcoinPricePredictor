Interestingly though, not many more. Just a few more. Reasoning, calculation and conclusion below.\n\n[I think you may accidentally have thought that one Skype emoji character represents 128 * 8 = 1024 bits of data, from looking at your reasoning. That is not true. One Skype emoji character represents only 128 bits of data.]\n\nThere can be 256 different alphanumerical characters. You need 8 bits (ones or zeros) to be able to represent that many combinations (2^8 = 256).  \nThere can be 128 different Skype emoji characters. You need 7 bits to be able to represent that many combinations (2^7 = 128).\n\nIf we assume one bitcoin transaction needs 250 (8-bit) bytes (which is the same as 250 alphanumerical characters) of data to be valid, we would need 250 * 8 = 2 000 bits of information to be able to represent it.\n\nWould one Skype emoji be able to represent the whole bitcoin transaction? No it wouldn\'t, because just one Skype emoji can represent only 7 bits of data, but it needs to be able to represent 2 000 bits of data. One emoji represents only 7 bits which is much less than the needed 2 000 bits.\n\nOk, so would 2 emojis be able to represent the whole bitcoin transaction? No it wouldn\'t because 2 emojis can represent only 2 * 7 = 14 bits of information. That\'s still not 2 000 bits.\n\nSo, how many emojis would we need then? We would need 2 000 / 7 = 285.7 emojis (so practically speaking, 286 emojis). We can verify that by seeing that 286 emojis * 7 bits = 2 002 bits, which is more than the required minimum of 2 000 bits.\n\n**So even though the Skype emoji character set is half the size (128 bits) of the alphanumerical character set (256 bits), we only need 286 Skype emoji characters to represent a bitcoin transaction that would need 250 alphanumerical characters to do the same. That\'s just 36 more characters.

A clean fork would split the coin into two independent coins.  Everybody would have the same amount of each coin that they had before the fork, and would be able to move and trade them independently.  Miners could freely choose which coin to mine, and would get rewards and fees in that coin only.  Each coin could have its own parameters and rule details, like reward decay schedule, block size limit, fee policies, etc..\n\nEach coin will have its market price, and the sum of the two prices may be lower or higher than the previous price, depending on how the fork is "sold" to the users and investors.  Those who dislike coin \'A\' could sell all their \'A\' holdings and buy more of coin \'B\', and vice-versa.  Free market will ultimately define the value of each coin.

Increasing the block size limit would be necessary to accomodate expected growth of that usage over the next few years.  That would imply keeping the fees low enough for e-commerce payments (starting with tens of dollars).\n\nThe "small-blockian" camp instead wants to divert the bitcoin network for a different goal: to become the settlement network for the "hubs" of another payment network, with a very different structure and philosophy.  In this "overlay network", person-to-person payments would be executed mostly off the blockchain, with the intermediation of a few large "hubs".  That goal implies driving almost all person-to-person and e-commerce traffic off the bitcoin network and into off-chain payment systems (like Coinbase of Circle for now, and LN eventually).  That would be accomplished by retaining the artificial 1 MB block size limit, so that competition for space in the blocks would raise the transaction fees to levels that could be affordable only for large payments (like 100 USD per transaction).\n\nGiven these two radically distinct views of what bitcoin should be, perhaps the right solution is indeed to split the coin -- into a "people\'s bitcoin" with 8 MB blocks and low fees, and a "hub\'s bitcoin" with 1 MB (or even smaller) blocks and large fees.  And then let the market decide how much each coin is worth.': 1}, ("Union Square Ventures' Andy Weissman On The Blockchain And The Music Rights 'Nirvana State'", 1): {'[**@TonySwish**](https://twitter.com/TonySwish/)\r\n\r\n> [2015-07-20 05:39 UTC](https://twitter.com/TonySwish/status/623004345756438528)\r\n\r\n> @aweissman I think your thoughts on music & \\#Bitcoin is interesting.

I'm very grateful that bitcoin.com keeps the pop-up from bitcoin.org that appears when you click the wallet, but the 'bump' system turns a merit system into a 'who wants to throw more money into advertising' system. It corrupts the system.

But yes, you\'re right in what you say. Roger has no obligation. I just hope he sees the big picture, and tries to do all he can to promote a high quality ecosystem.\n\nBy the way, I\'m actually not concerned. If he chooses to monetize the site aggressively (or as you put it, "maximize revenue") in a way that detracts from providing users a merit-based look at the ecosystem, then what will happen is quite simple: Google\'s ranking of the site\'s quality will decrease so the site will get pushed further down and buried in the search results, Bitcoin communities (like Reddit, IRC, google plus, facebook, etc.) will gradually learn that bitcoin.com is a commercialized site (and so the site will be vilified in the community), and so on. This has already played out in the community with low-quality news sites like \'cryptocoinnews\' and \'newsbtc\'.\n\nIt will be a vicious cycle that results in the value of bitcoin.com decreasing ever further, and Roger\'s own reputation suffering. In its place, bitcoin.org will remain the top-ranking go-to site (according to Google, and according to the community) for Bitcoin.\n\nIf the above happens though, I don\'t want to see Roger complaining, or anyone else complain on his behalf that "the community should stick together".

The risk though is that they may disappear or freeze your balance for some reason outside your control. \n\nThe second type is a payment channel (used by streamium and in theory by the lightning network). There, an initial funding transaction happens on-chain followed by a series of payments that are held off-chain until there is a disagreement or the payment needs to  be finalized. In this case there is less risk of the coins disappearing and effects can be instant but it requires a little more work and connectivity to handle the payment. \n\nBoth are ways of saving money on Bitcoin network fees and supporting smaller, more continuous transactions.

Or maybe you expect it to go viral and double every 6 months? Given the current state of technology - it\'s clearly impossible. The first viral app was email and it only went viral when enough people had PC\'s and the technology had proven itself in the field. IMHO same goes for blockchain money. There will be no viral adoption until wallets proliferate and mobile payments become ubiquitous. Until then BTC will just linger, doubling every few years or so...': 2, 'Price was also lower.

Factor in the transaction volume of the alt-coins, and user adoption had exploded). Again maybe not with the type of user you have in mind\n\nExchanges are are indeed weak (compared to FOREX), however they are orders of magnitude better from what they used to be just few years ago. Also as a method of converting fiat to crypto, exchanges are already good enough. Many do take credit card payments thus further minimizing the counterparty risk. Exchanges are not substitutes for bitcoin wallets however and should not be held to the same standards. In particular they are not banks.\n\nWhales do control the market. Any market (stock, bonds, fiat)\n\nMining is booming because Chinese miners are allowed to register this as "bitcoin manufacturing" with CPC (china\'s planning commission). As such they are allowed to "export the BTC" for dollars. In essence BTC mining in China is a way of circumventing currency controls. And there\'s a lot of cash that wants to leave china.\n\nThe fact that with 10% growth in M1, BTC still holds its value is a strong indicator of the systemic strength of the economy that underpins it.  And since the monetary policy is publicly known, it removes one significant risk factor from the future pricing of the coin. Unlike FOREX, where the key to success is second guessing the intent of its respective central bank & cleptocratic gang also known as political elite\n\nFinally, on the user base. There\'s a number of smart people for whom using fiat is harder than using bitcoin.  It\'s usually due to the nature of their activities or/and moral values (*I for one believe that transacting in fiat promotes war and theft.*). So the question is how many of those folks are around, and what\'s their economic output. If we take the (very conservative) assumption of 250,000 world wide (Coinbase alone has 2M users), then you\'re talking of the population of a mid-sized town. In this town, most everyone has a college degree with many holding advanced degrees in math and science. There\'s a strong sense of belonging, resembling a religious cult complete with a mythical founder (SN) and his (living) disciples. So (*based on per capita income of Boston and Salt Lake City*) this town\'s gross income would be around $25K*$250K=$6B .... which kind of nicely correlates with the current BTC market cap': 8, 'Spam or not - it\'s usage hence adoption. Spam email is also email. And spam goes where the value is.\n\nBeing worth something counts as holding a value. Going from 0 to 1000 was a spectacular move, Retreating back to 200 (or 20 to that matter) still counts as holding value (*compared to Lehman Brothers on Enron stocks*). Naturally you cannot expect an entity underpinned only by market to have the short term moves of a "government backed" (aka taxpayer funded) scheme. Give me control over IRS, NSA, DoD and the printing presses and I could "stabilize" the short term price of Bitcoin (or anything else) at practically any level. The problem is that such stability will cost enormous amounts on money as all my goons (*and their friends*) will be living the good life at taxpayer\'s expense.\n\nThere will always be war. The more funding goes into it - the more of it there will be. And by theft I did not meant the debasement of fiats (*that I consider part of the tax code, but this is whole new topic*) I mean the simple fact of being able to produce money out of your pocket and claim them as yours promotes theft at all levels - people get mugged, robbed and so fourth. IMHO in a perfect world, every cent one owns should be publicly traceable to a legitimate source. This applies for governments, corporations and individuals.

They have 100m users, great. They allow people to chat privately. How many people would pay for this service? How long until Apple/Google build these features into the native phone messaging app to get some people back? \n\nI don't quite understand how Snapchat can extract 18 billion dollars out of their customers without charging a monthly premium or selling their data to advertisers. The barrier to making a secure messaging app is low and competitors like Telegram are doing quite well, making a monthly free for Snapchat result in a mass exodus. Likewise, selling customer data or filling them with ads isn't in the spirit of a privacy focused application. But if they make it, great, it could be a 20B dollar company. Could it be 40B, 100B, or 500B dollar company? \n\nCompare that to something like Bitcoin, a global decentralized currency, backed by an immutable ledger. What's the maximum potential for Bitcoin? It's not an app but many apps for it exist. It's not a company but many companies exist because of it. There isn't a revenue model, it is the revenue. Its competitors are the U.S. Dollar, the yen, the euro. These currencies are flooding in to create more companies to build more infrastructure for Bitcoin at a rate greater than any other technology. It makes possible a vast economy for goods and services, some illicit, some legitimate. It also has a token to fuel these transactions, of which only 21 million will ever exist.

Most of that spurious traffic would surely disappear if the minimum transaction fee was set to some significant value, like 0.10 USD or so, that would not harm its use for payments.\n\nIndeed, comparing that chart with [the estimated USD transaction volume per day](https://blockchain.info/charts/estimated-transaction-volume-usd?timespan=2year&showDataPoints=false&daysAverageString=28&show_header=true&scale=0) strongly suggests that the doubling of the traffic over the last year was entirely due to an increase in the "spurious" transactions.\n\n> and nearly 1 BILLION dollars in 30 day exchange volume\n\nVoume in most exchanges has dropped dramatically over the last year.  \n\nMost trade volume in the exchanges is due to "robots" (automatic scripts) that buy and sell the same coins hundreds of times per day.

Or at least, they don\'t have to.\n\nIf a majority of miners would stop enforcing the P2SH soft fork, then knowing the serialized scripts (and not the signatures) of a P2SH output would be enough to spend the output.\n\nA P2SH script looks like:\n\n    OP_HASH160 [20 bytes] OP_EQUAL\n\nIt can, through original script interpretation rules, be spent with a single OP_PUSHDATA of some data (the serialized script) which hashes to the 20 bytes in the output. No signatures needed.\n\nOnly through a miner-enforced soft fork are additional conditions added to these outputs: The serialized script which hashes to the 20 bytes in the scriptPubKey is interpreted as another scriptPubKey, and the remainder of the scriptSig as another scriptSig. Only if this \'embedded\' script executes correctly and returns TRUE without failures can the output be spent.\n\nMiners enforce this, not nodes.\n\nIn this case (P2SH), nodes *can* enforce it without further infrastructure (and I believe full nodes in Bitcoin Core also execute the embedded serialized script, although they discard/ignore the result), but if a majority of miners would suddenly stop enforcing P2SH, not a single node would fork, because in their mind the consensus rules have not been broken.\n\nSimilarly, nodes can be oblivious to sidechains because a miner-enforced soft-fork changes not a single rule in a way nodes would care: the additional conditions stuck upon an unspent sidechain-relevant transaction output are completely backward compatible and do not require the consent of everyone in the network, everyone in the network doesn\'t have to observe the rule because the new rule fits in the existing ones.\n\n// edit: typos': 1, "As a miner is calculating the POW, does it add incoming tx to the POW after every failed attempt and what kind of resources does that require for the computer?  \nSimilarly, how does this work when mining with a pool?  \nSeems to me like it'd be easier just to mine empty blocks or ones with fewer tx so you could pump out a winning block faster, but would love have a little more detail.": 5, "You can't attach proofs to a block after it's been made without invalidating it, and any flags you pass on while propagating are trivially replaced by anyone who doesn't observe the 'rules', also any known identity attached to a node or message implies an entity permissioning that identity with some special privilege, which contradicts what bitcoin stands for so far and will tend toward centralization.\n\n----\n\nEconomically incentivizing nodes is great and all, but to be honest I don't believe nodes need such an incentive to be run by independent participants; running a node offers significant benefits to the operator they otherwise do not get: The simplest proof that you can get that the blockchain contains valid data, and the network performs how it is intended, is to be running a full node. I believe this incentive alone is sufficient for a large enough amount of independently operated nodes to audit and observe the blockchain and the network.\n\nIf the reasoning to fund nodes is to improve block propagation times between miners, then I can tell you this, for a large part, has already been solved by the High Speed Relay Network, which is a separate peering network that greatly reduces the amount of time needed for blocks to reach all miners that use it.": 1, "Waite.
