Right now, mining yields a total of about 1 million dollars per day.  The amount will vary with the BTC price and the fee policy, but it is likely to be of that order of magnitude for a couple of years (barring a catastrophic price crash).\n\nWhenever there is that amount of money flowing into some activity, that activity is likely to become industrialized.  (See Brock Pierce\'s billion-dollar company that took over the "mining" of WoW videogame money and points.) An expected revenue of (say) 1000 $/day makes it worth spending a couple hundred thousand dollars to acquire special equipment, build proper installations,  hire personel, etc..  \n\nSo, in order to end industrialized mining, the total revenue possible from mining would have to be too small to justify buying specialized hardware for it.  Assuming 240\'000 clients who bother to mine on their PC or laptop, for 1 hour per day, they would have the equivalent of 100 GH/s total, 24/7.  To make "industrial" mining unprofitable, the total mining revenue would have to be less than 10 $/day (otherwise it would be profitable to buy a 100 GH/s mining rig, which would get 50% of the total mining revenue).  So, in order to prevent industrialization of mining, the BTC price would have to be 1/100\'000 of what it is today: less than 0.3 US cents.\n\nMoreover the industry will tends  concentrated, because economies of scale.  Individual miners have an incentive to deploy more hardware, as long as it is profitable, to capture a larger slice of that fixed revenue.  However, that reduces the revenue of all other miners.  The miner who has more capital can get a bigger slice of the revenue pie, hence collect more capital; while his smaller competitors will become less profitable, and will eventually drop out of the market.\n\nBecause of the fixed revenue, the market for chips is limited too.  Suppose that a manufaturer captures 90% of the market by selling 1 million chips of a new efficient design. Each chip will earn ~1 $/day of revenue to its owner, or ~730 $ in two years, before costs; which might justify a price of 100 $/chip, or 100 M$ for the chip maker.  If the company sold 1 billion of chips instead, each chip would produce only 0.0001 $/day, or 0.72 $ in two years; and the price of each chip would have to be 0.10 $, and the chip maker would still collect only 100 M$ -- at 1000 times the cost.': 0, "Once it's possible to obtain significant amounts of money from doing something, that thing will inevitably be controlled by large corporations and industry.\n\nLook at any technology - computers, the Internet, banking (not in chronological order).\n\nThis is inevitable because the corporations are the ones who have the money to spend researching better ways to get more money.

It's also worth noting that even without dual use of mining ASICs, mining concentrates where cheap energy is found, and cheap energy has some natural inclination toward being dispersed (though government policy, like the Chinese government's subsidization of electricity, can have the reverse effect at the cross-country level).": 4, "Like everything else about the IoT the catch is who controls the resistor in your space heater.\n\n* You?\n* The manufacturer?\n* The company that makes software for the manufacturer?\n* Chinese hackers? \n\nIt feels like we need to get ahead of this and form some kind of Home Appliance Liberation Front, otherwise our fridges aren't necessarily going to be acting in our best interests.": 2, 'Fair enough.

It presumes a level of familiarity most users do not have. \n\nIn the bitcoin ecosystem, the use of the word 'ATM' itself is misleading and unhelpful even in a metaphorical sense, since there is no 'withdrawal' of funds, UTXOs persist on the blockchain and in no circumstance does an ATM involve a deposit of cash/exchange. \n\nIt is important to pay attention to these nuances in designing pieces of the bitcoin architecture as they are responsible for educating the consumer about the fundamental properties of a nascent technology.\n\nI would suggest that the typical user who was knowledgable enough to install a wallet on a smartphone and scan a 'receiving' QR code could just as easily purchase bitcoin with fiat online without use of a physical machine. \n\nThe utility in this machine would be realised if, for example, it could exchange fiat and propagate a transaction from Alice (present at machine) to Bob (not at machine), seamlessly. Alice, say, being a Philippine worker in Hong Kong, Bob being a family member. \n\nAny constituent part of bitcoin infrastructure should assume a complete absence of knowledge on the part of the consumer of the bitcoin protocol, bitcoin wallets, ATMs or the traditional banking system.\n\nBitcoin has a long way to go in refining the design metaphors it uses to properly convey its utility. Unfortunately, referring to artefacts from legacy banking innovations such as ATMs is contrived and just won't cut it.\n": -1, 'Sending money to Bob would be as simple as holding up Bob\'s address instead of Alice\'s at the machine.\n\nI agree that "ATM" is the incorrect term, if there is no "withdraw" option (send the machine bitcoins, it spits out cash).

I can see the value though in referring to an automatic teller machine to mean an automated system that performs the function of a bank teller (i.e. a cashier) when customers were making the transition from dealing with human beings to holes in the wall, and at the time such machines were introduced, the ATM nomenclature would have made sense. However, where there is no existing 'balance' or 'fund' to draw from, and no 'withdrawal' of funds, the ATM analogy (let's assume for these purposes the analogy is the acronym ATM rather than the 'automated teller machine') makes no sense other than to say it is a physical machine that has to do with money. 'Automatic Bitcoin Bureaux de Change' would be better. I would disagree that it helps people understand what the machine does or what bitcoin is. The chief goal of early stage machines such as this should be to properly introduce the essences of the new technology.\n\nWhether 'vending machine' is appropriate is a question of whether one views bitcoin as a means of exchange or a store of value, a moot point but I think there are better analogies to be found.\n\nInterface features such as the lack of a physical PIN input keypad, the lack of functions such as checking one's balance and the lack of physical withdrawal from the machine conspire to mean the ATM analogy is not all that helpful. A bitcoin ATM as seen in the video is more analogous to a 'bitcoin wallet' which is capable of generating transactions based on inputs from other transactions occurring on the network. \n\nThe metaphor of language, messaging and email is much more helpful and approachable. To take one example: imagine if the interaction with such a machine consisted simply of a Skype based video chat between Alice (Philippine maid in Hong Kong) and Bob (Son/Husband/Father) who was operating an identical machine such that they could speak in real time and the insertion of an amount of local currency by either of them would form the basis of a bitcoin transaction transmitted seamlessly across the network (manifesting itself as local currency withdrawn from the other machine) without reference to a bitcoin wallet or QR code. \n": 0, "Don't forget the glory hole for the DNA check...": 3, 'How is the process if you buy more than 250\xe2\x82\xac or 500\xe2\x82\xac worth of bitcoins?': 1}, ('16 dollar difference between Bitstamp and BTC-E', 0): {'often the diff is 4 dollars and sometimes they are quite close.

It takes away the top-down ability to set interest rate (not that banks listen to that anyway).\n\nThe main reason countries steal their citizens savings by inflation is because it makes loans that the country made cheaper to repay.\n\nSo when your country loses its biggest export, and the income in taxes towards the country goes down, the problem is really not what economists say. They will say its lack of growth.  But you don\'t need growth to keep feeding your people.  You need growth to allow the interest-on-interest-on-interest of the last 50 years to be re-payed.\n\nPeople that have their savings in Bitcoin (or houses or gold) don\'t need the economy to grow because they don\'t have to suffer the inflation imposed by the government in order for the government to pay back the interest-on-interest.\nAs such a drop in income from export means that the company needs to fire people, those people will have to find smart new things to do and make money another way.

They think that they (a company) will create 'their own' blockchain, and that their own blockchain will automatically have all the benefits of the Bitcoin Blockchain, but this is not true.\n\nIf the network is private, it will not be trustless, because the company that controls access to the network will be able to ban nodes that don't agree with itself.  The controlling company does not think this is a problem, but users of the system do.  The point of a blockchain is that it removes the need to trust a central company because math works the same way for everyone.  This private blockchain cannot be relied upon to work for everyone, because at any moment the access controlling company could deny any user access to their own money.\n\nIf the network is public, the company that creates it will have to accept the fact that it cannot contol access to the system (like Bitcoin), which is an anathema to them.  But even if it is public, it will be orders of magnitude smaller and less secure from attack than the Bitcoin network, since any tokens that could be mined would not have the market value of bitcoins without some sort of 'backing' that requires trust of a counter party to keep their promise to redeem the tokens for whatever asset they are supposedly backed by.": 1, "One possibility of how the Bitcoin blockchain could be used for other purposes is by using colored coins 'on top' of the Bitcoin blockchain.  In this solution, some amount of bitcoin would be 'colored' and agreed upon to represent a share of stock in a particular company (for example).  These particular bitcoins could then be traded between individuals using the security of the decentralized Bitcoin blockchain.  \n\nAnother possibility being worked on is called sidechains, in which another blockchain has a specific mathematical relationship with the Bitcoin blockchain in a way that may allow it to inherit some of the security provided by Bitcoin mining.  \n\nAFAIK, all of the proposed 'blockchain can be used for anything' / smart contract scenarios are still rather vague on details as of today.  But there are a lot of experienced programmers exploring the possibilities, notably the Blockstream company that currently employs some of the developers working on the Bitcoin Core software.": 1, "What's the necessary size?
