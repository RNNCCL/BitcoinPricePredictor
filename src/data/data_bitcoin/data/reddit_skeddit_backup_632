Second, *D* sends back to *B* the double signed refund transaction(**TR4**). *B* now opens the payment channel with *D* by sending the 50 funds to *M1* in **TF5**. *D* now has 50 funds from *B* locked in *M1*(collateral that forces *B* to not sign any new version of **TP3**) and a refund transaction(**TR4**) to return 50 funds to *B* at some point in the future if something goes wrong.

They explain these, too.\n\nA payment channel is a 2 out of 2 time locked script, where the two parties agree on how to distribute the coins in the address, initially provided by one of the parties, among them. The paper calls the parties A (the funder of the the channel) and B, the recipient.\n\nThen they go on and suggest to add one or several parties D to the output of the channel. A and B agree to attribute part of the funds to party D (D1, D2, etc.). Here is, where there lays a huge problem for D. If A and B collude to take the funds from D, they can at any time prior to closing the channel.\n\nThe authors continue, fixing this issue by closing the channel immediately with the attribution of funds to party D (giving it max priority). (Not mentioned in the paper but D could receive the closing transaction and thus would not be susceptible to A or B disappearing. Still, A+B could collude against D and try to double-spend the closing transaction, rendering the benefits of a trust-less system trust-based. D has to trust B or A. Still better than having to trust A.)\n\nFinally, the authors introduce the missing C, which is a fund provider to open channels. I guess the point is to bridge the gap between channels or something.\n\nMy conclusion is that this merely is better than greenaddress, as it requires D to trust B (assuming D doesn\'t generally trust A).\n\n**My suggestion for a truly safe transaction channel infrastructure**\n\nAs suggested many times before although never in completeness, I again suggest to standardize payment hubs as follows:\n\n* Lets call the payers A1, A2, ...\n* Lets call the payment hubs B1, B2, ...\n* Lets call the liquidity providers C1, C2, ...\n* Lets call the recipient D1, D2, ...\n\nEach A maintains a channel with one or many B.\n\nEach D either trusts one or many B to pay them at any interval or pays them an amount to open a channel towards them for a given time. Standard credit rates apply. (Actually this credit should be much cheaper as a default is not an option.) For the sake of argument, lets assume D pays B $10/month to open a $1000 channel. More on that rate down below.\n\nA keeps a channel to his respective B open at all time. Basically he could have all his funds in that channel, locked up for a year if bitcoin migrated to use this scheme globally.\n\nTo make a payment A1 to D2\n\n* A1 would update his channel with his B3 assuming B3 is A1\'s hub\n* B3 would update its channel with B4 assuming B4 is D2\'s hub\n* B4 would update its channel with D2\n* D2 would confirm having received the funds to A1\n\nsome properties:\n\n* If A1 doesn\'t trust the chain too much, it could pay in tiny increments. $1 at a time. It should be possible to send at least 10 transactions per second, so you could still funnel through big amounts quickly if you go in 1% increments.\n* Funds being lost by a player would be identifiable, thus making it easy to proof to others that a certain player is not to be trusted.\n* A has to only trust his B and should demand proof that the fund got lost down the line from there in order to not blame B in case of lost funds. This way, players would be incentivized to use channels but if they trust each other, they could even settle their balances differently. D2 could trust "his bank" to owe him the funds instead of funding a payment channel to his wallet.\n\n**Bi-directional channels**\n\nThe scenario above requires the recipient to be connected, so that the reception of incremental payments can be confirmed. If the reception doesn\'t need to be confirmed, D being online is no requirement. B4 could forward funds later. (trust required!)\n\nAssuming though that the recipient is online in the moment of payment, which would be the case in 100% of POS situations, the receiving channel could be updated but the recipient would still be susceptible to the wrong final transaction being published if it misses the time slot to publish its most favorable transaction. This problem led to the notion that the receiving end of a channel has to be a server and the sending end may be an occasionally connected client.\n\nIt is trivial to solve this issue by paying servers to publish the most favorable transaction at the favored time. Any receiving wallet could require 3 versions of that receiving transaction, each with another further recipient out of 3 servers that offer to broadcast transactions. The recipient could now share these 3 transactions with the 3 services and now these services would compete to broadcast the transaction at just the right time in order to get the reward. The recipient could for a fraction of a cent be sure that his channel gets closed with his transaction being considered. Should the sender try to publish the prior version where the payment was not made, miners would pick up the version from the 3 servers due to higher priority. **(turns out, the way these servers could get paid is not that trivial. Assuming the broadcast of a transaction is worth less than dust levels, the payment would have to be done via channels, too, so there would be no need to forge 3 transactions unless the fingerprint of those transactions was used to determine which of the 3 servers actually delivered based on which transaction ended in the blockchain. Anyway, such a service is would have only minor privacy issues.)**\n\nNow this in turn would allow to use channels bi-directionally. D having received funds could update its channel to send those funds back to his B, making the situation symmetric.\n\n**Further considerations**\n\nParties could incentivize their respective other ends of channels to close those channels to free funds.\n\nC could offer their funds anonymously (I can elaborate on that in another post), resulting in fair prices for their customers and way to invest bitcoins without risk.\n\nC might even offer negative commissions as C would essentially launder funds.

So the recipient of the micropayment knows the transaction is good, and the money will be transferred to him when he broadcasts the transaction.\n\nThis is good for doing quick, successive transactions. But seemingly it can also be used to do a single, lump sum transaction that is instant, because the transaction's source of funds are locked up, and cannot be moved.\n\nThe traditional way of double spending is funding an address B using address A, and then sending a conflicting transaction that sends funds from A to C instead. The owner of the address B will think he's received the funds, because he has a valid transaction sending funds from A->B. But because the address A doesn't lock up the funds, this allows the owner of address A to create a new transaction, that pays to address C instead, leaving the owner of address B without anything. Payment channels prevent this by locking up the source funds.": 3, "This is what I understand for a micropayment channel:\n\n- I send you a transaction(1) that sends some money from me to you but the trick is that you still haven't sent me THAT money, so you can't yet get the money(and now you have the right to get your money back sometime in the future) - The moment you release Transaction 1 to the Bitcoin network you get your money back \n\n- Now you send me the actual money in a transaction(2) (knowing that you have the right to return it to yourself any time you want but you still keep the return transaction(1) locally in your PC to use it only when needed) - Transaction(2) is released to the network so everybody knows you sent me the money\n\n- The magic is: instead you of releasing the refund transaction(1), you send a new version of the transaction(1) that returns almost all the money to yourself, just like before, except now a part of that money STAYS with me. If I agree with this new transaction(3) (obviously I agree with keeping more money than before), then I can sign the new transaction(3) and send it to you - No new transaction has been released to the Bitcoin network.\n\n- Finally, we both can keep repeating the magic step and send new versions of the refund transaction(1).

Not to mention the possibilities that are yet to be discovered. \n\nBlock chain technologies are the revolution. The real deal we are gathered here . Bitcoin the coin, or more relevant to the topics here , it's price , is all the speculations talks in correlation to what all these block chain solutions will give to the coins value via demand! \n\nSo please do your homework about Bitcoin and its block chain solution before you downplay it as just an other payment solution. ": 1, 'No, for several reasons, try to figure them out yourself. How many/few coins do you think are traded on the market? How many do you think are not on the market at that low price?\n\nHow many do you think would be willing to buy lots of coins at that price or at 35? 36? 37? \n\nPrices can not stay on that low level for any long time at all, it will spike up.\n\n': 1, 'yer welcome, buddy': 0, 'Yeah, this cycle can surely continue over and over, but the end result will always be the same: Eventually the extremely low demand for bitcoin will make those spikes plummet, and over time this will result in settling at its actual price. 35 will seem cheap only until nobody is buying at 50 where the next spike peaks, and it continues to slowly decline below 35,  say to 30. Then 35 will be expensive. You need to look at these things in relative terms, which you aren\'t. 3 months ago during bearwhale people were saying 275 was cheap as hell, now 275 is completely out of reach. This is exactly what has been going on with bitcoin since it hit 1000. People say "Damn thats cheap", buy in at 800, the demand isn\'t actually there beyond speculation so it drops.. then 700 is cheap.. then 600 is cheap.. then 400, 200, 175... All of these prices are, in reality, fucking *astronomically* expensive outside of speculation, and always have been. \n\nThere is no realistic consumer demand for Bitcoin to be worth over 100 dollars, probably not even over 50. This whole thing is just a slow game by day traders and whales milking every last dollar they can out of a deflating balloon. They can\'t sustain it forever, they can only delay its plunge as they have been for the past year. When they said wall street was coming, they didn\'t mean to skyrocket bitcoin to new heights, they meant *coming to game you fools out of your money while they can*': 1, "I've done my research and I've read the same thing 1000 times. Potential and reality are two very different things. Blockchain technology being useful does not inherently equate to bitcoin being successful/worth more than it is now. I can list off a hundred great ideas that should have taken off that simply did not, for various reasons. \n\nTime to take off the rose coloured glasses and recognize that most people don't care about Bitcoin, and further that the world of Bitcoin is doing little to nothing to change that. If anything, the world of bitcoin has so far made it a much scarier proposition to newcomers if they do any research. You underestimate the repercussions of a constant stream of bad news re: scams, thieves, hacks, and insolvency. Combine that with all the room for human error (Losing wallet key, transfering to wrong wallet, opening the door for theft, and so on) and you have a currency very few people are actually going to want to use, or even be able to use safely in the first place.\n\nJust because a small percentile of people can use bitcoin on a daily basis with ease, you perhaps being one of them, does not mean 95% of the worlds population can make sense of it at all to begin with, let alone use it regularly with no risk of loss due to the vast room for human error (without even MENTIONING the loss incurred from downswing it's been in for a year). People are not generally very smart or tech savvy. People using bitcoin probably are. What seems like a breeze for you is a nightmare for most people out there. Until these flaws are addressed, there's no reason Bitcoin will succeed.

There's no way it's hitting 1000+ again, go ahead and use your remindme's on this comment and come back in 3 months to see the value down another 100 bucks. Exchanges are bailing, people are bailing, the public doesn't know about it and those who do think it's either a scam, or don't care enough about it to use it. *And there's nothing for them to use it on if they do get some,* as I found out. There was absolutely no reason for me to have bitcoin! Zero incentive! In fact **there is considerably less than zero incentive to have money in bitcoin**, even small amounts: *I would have lost $300 if I didn't exchange back to CAD 2 weeks after first getting bitcoin, simply for having it*. Who in their right mind would want to buy into that? \n \nThere's no motivation to get any unless you're speculating the value will explode/daytrading, so tell me.. who's buying bitcoin, and why would a newcomer WANT to buy bitcoin? All you ever read about are scams, deceit, theft, hacks, and generally shady characters with their hands in the pot. There is simply no incentive for the average person to even consider using bitcoin. \n\nI pay something like 2-3 bucks (and it literally takes no longer than sending bitcoin) to send money from my bank account to someones email, where they can instantly deposit it to their bank. No risk, no bullshit, no possibility of entering the wrong wallet address and losing it forever, etc..

I'm really gonna miss that $2 guys... Small price to pay for peace of mind.\n\n*There's no incentive for anybody but daytraders and longterm holders to have bitcoin*. I challenge any of you to dispute this statement and present valid reasons to the contrary. If you can't, I challenge you to present valid reasons as to why that will change.

What it can do is empower the little guy to find creative local solutions. \n\nLet's imagine a wonderful fantasy world where the value of Bitcoin doesn't drop 20% overnight ;) Also let's imagine there is a local company in Kenya, Uganda, etc that imports supplies from the USA. Right now that local company has to buy dollars, send them and deal with all the overheads of the banking system. The supplier, as it happens, accepts Bitcoin for its goods, but that doesn't help the local African company because it would have to buy bitcoins by using Bitstamp or some other exchange that needs dollars/euros not the local currency, and at that point they may as well just send the money directly.\n\nNow some local entrepreneur talks to this company and discovers their need - they *could* pay in bitcoins, if only there was a convenient way for them to swap local currency for coins. That entrepreneur sees a new market - he can start doing casual remittance, hawala style. He spreads the word that he is buying bitcoins off people and giving them local currency in return. Some people hear about this and tell their children who are working in the USA about this wonderful new scheme. Those children decide that next time they send money home, they'll go to a local Bitcoin ATM in their city and acquire some coins, then send them to their parents back in Africa. The parents then go to the entrepreneur with their cheap China-made $50 Android smartphone, and swap the coins for local currency. The entrepreneur then goes to the business, sells them the coins for a small markup, and keeps the profit in fiat. Finally the business sends the coins they acquired back to the USA to buy supplies and the loop is complete - no banks, no Western Union, and the third parties involved (ATM operator, local entrepreneur) don't have many overheads or startup costs so competition should keep their profit margins in check.\n\nThe local entrepreneur will at some point have to start dealing with AML/KYC stuff as well, although presumably only to the extent Hawaladars do. US Treasury hates hawala because it's so heavily oriented around personal relationships, which doesn't fit neatly into their fairly mechanical regulations e.g. there's no point requiring an electricity bill from someone who you've known for 20 years but who doesn't have an electricity supply, so US Treasury sees that hawaladar as a regulation-avoiding money laundering terrorist financier.

The smaller amounts you use, more secure you\'ll feel that there\'s no way to withdraw such tiny amount.\n\nIf you want to put more money, for each deposit repeat all 4 steps mentioned to make sure that you have very small amounts in every locker you\'ve created for money.\n\nEach time you\'re using the same passphrase with different locker combinations.
