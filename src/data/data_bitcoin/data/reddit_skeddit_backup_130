When transaction load spikes above 1MB/10mins for short periods, high fee transactions confirm immediately, the rest sit around in mempool until load goes down, and then they confirm hours or days later.  \n\nHowever if trends continue, transaction load will continue to grow, while transaction capacity remains capped at 1MB/10mins.  Soon this will hit the point where load doesn't just exceed 1MB/10mins for short periods, it is SUSTAINED at 1+MB/10mins.  That means that those free and low-fee transactions will never find space in a block.\n\nAt this point we will have to start pruning the mempool.  That means taking valid transactions from people who are legitimately trying to use Bitcoin, and throwing those transactions away.  \n\nIf we do that, it means the end of fairly reliable 0-conf.  Right now I can send a transaction and even with 0 confirmations, you can be pretty sure it will confirm soon.  That allows Bitcoin to work at point of sale- I send you coins, you see the transaction, you give me my purchase and I leave the store (even though the transaction has not confirmed).  \nIf we are throwing away transactions, then you won't be sure if my transaction will confirm or not.  So I will have to pay a large transaction fee to guarantee the transaction confirms quickly, or I have to stay in the store until I get a confirmation.  I hope you can see how this could kill many current uses of Bitcoin.  \n\nAlso, the 1MB limit applies a static, hard-to-change ceiling on the number of transactions Bitcoin can process.  Network usage is a highly dynamic and unpredictable thing.  Having real transaction load exceed network capacity means that if load spikes, even more legitimate transactions get thrown away.  \n\nThe important thing to understand, is right now if I send you Bitcoins, you can be quite sure they will arrive.  If load exceeds capacity and we're pruning the mempool, you can no longer be sure your Bitcoins will arrive until they (maybe) confirm hours or days later, otherwise they may not arrive at all.  That's a Bad Thing.\n\n": 3, "Some miners do mine empty blocks.  If anything, that makes bigger blocks even more of a priority- if 1 out of 10 blocks are empty, that means the network's *effective* transaction capacity is 900KB/10mins, not 1MB/10mins.  \n\nSo while 2MB blocks won't stop empty blocks, they will provide capacity to handle the transactions that weren't included in the empty block.  \n\nAlso there are various improvements in progress that will reduce the incentive for empty blocks.  Miners mine empty blocks because they can transfer the block faster than a full block.  New ideas like Thin Blocks could greatly reduce (by 70% or more) the bandwidth required to transmit a block, which would make miners far more likely to avoid empty blocks since the full block wouldn't take much longer to transmit.  \n\nThe basic idea behind thin blocks is that a block contains transactions that a node already has in mempool, so why transmit them again?  Just send the block headers without the actual transactions.  A node will then pull the transactions out of its own mempool and reassemble the full block that way.  Since the headers are a tiny part of the block, this makes things far more efficient.": 1, 'More importantly, it does not make sense to accept a payment method that not only won\'t save any money, but might not deliver your payment at all.  \n\nIf you\'re a bartender, and I say "Here\'s a payment for a drink, which you might get in 10 minutes or in two days, or which might not arrive at all if too many other people elsewhere pay for too many other things", would you want that payment?

It\'s taken us ~5years to get awareness of Bitcoin to where it is now, which is to say, useful levels of adoption are just starting to happen.  If we tell all those people to scrap Bitcoin and switch to an altcoin, they\'re just going to tune out for another 5-10 years.  \n\nIncreasing the block size can be done responsibly with a hard fork in a month or two, and that will buy us another year at least to get things like SegWit and payment channels going.

If the limits aren\xe2\x80\x99t raised, the result could be debilitating bottlenecks. But fixing it requires altering a system that has been profitable for those that use heavy computer power to record transactions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMr. Hearn has been a vocal proponent for expanding the size limits. The problem is bitcoin is open-source software, so any change has to be approved a majority of the community, and it hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been able to agree.\n\nThis isn\xe2\x80\x99t the first time somebody has written bitcoin\xe2\x80\x99s obituary. What is different is this obit was being written by a prominent insider, and it hit a raw nerve in the community. The price of bitcoin, which had been stable for months, dropped sharply, down 20% last week to $358. The price regained some ground over the weekend, and many are still defending the currency in the wake of Mr. Hearn\xe2\x80\x99s comments.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBitcoin has long experienced extreme debates and misunderstandings,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sean Neville, the president of wallet-services startup Circle. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd it\xe2\x80\x99s another misunderstanding that blockchain technology can fail simply because governance and technical debates grow more difficult as bitcoin matures.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBitcoin has always had a divisive edge. Believers laud it as a currency that is free from central banks and a transaction system that works outside the normal financial system. Skeptics see it as a kooky currency whose values soar and crash unpredictably, a casino for computer nerds. Governments can\xe2\x80\x99t even agree whether it is a currency or a commodity.\n\nThe current split, however, undermines what many investors see as bitcoin\xe2\x80\x99s most promising invention: the decentralized \xe2\x80\x9cblockchain\xe2\x80\x9d ledger for maintaining a record of who owns what.\n\nIndividual transactions are packaged into blocks and confirmed by a highly complex mathematical \xe2\x80\x9crace.\xe2\x80\x9d Winners of the race collect a newly minted bitcoin as a reward.\n\nBitcoin\xe2\x80\x99s code limits the size of those blocks to one megabyte. Changing it requires consent from the so-called miners who have amassed the computing power to handle all the transactions. Mining already is so expensive that it takes company-sized investments to participate. Incumbents fear changing the size limit could affect their economics in unpredictable ways.\n\nNot making a change has ramifications as well. Congestion is already creating long delays in confirming some transactions as the growing network bumps up against the size limit.\n\nIn August, Mr. Hearn and Gavin Andresen, one of bitcoin\xe2\x80\x99s core developers, formally proposed raising the limit on the block size via an alternative version of bitcoin called Bitcoin XT, with higher size limits. This was an attempt at what is called in software circles a \xe2\x80\x9chard fork\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94creating a new version of a system that forces users to move to a new version.\n\nThe fight between backers of XT and the original version, now called Core, has been ugly. It has raged on Reddit and social media, users have been tossed off message boards, and there have been anonymous cyberattacks on users and companies. XT started off strongly, but hasn\xe2\x80\x99t gotten near gaining a consensus for change.\n\nThis stalemate is what finally convinced Mr. Hearn that bitcoin was fatally collapsing in on itself. Others are more hopeful.\n\nYet another proposal, this one called Bitcoin Classic, has emerged from the ashes of the XT/Core debate. It is a version of bitcoin that would allow for a two-megabyte limit, with rules put in place to raise it over time. It appears to be quickly winning support.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSometimes it takes a crisis to get everyone in a room,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fred Wilson of Union Square Ventures, a venture-capital firm with bitcoin investments, in a philosophical blog post. \xe2\x80\x9cThat may be how the block-size debate gets settled.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nWrite to Paul Vigna at paul.vigna@wsj.com': 2, 'If you google the link and click the article from search results, it will bypass the paywall.': 1}, ('Has anyone worked out which big wallet(s) were emptied in the last few days and how many coins were dumped into the market?', 12): {"3) I would say is not okay but impossible to prevent.\n4) I would say it's not ok if miners start to black list certain coins.

If there's a way the banks can use blockchains to reduce that to minutes\n\nThe nature of the traditional banking system does not allow clearing for fiat within minutes. Entries in bank books are I.O.U.s on money, while cash and reserves with the central bank are money only. When money is transmitted over the traditional banking system, the central bank just reduces the reserves of bank A and increases the reserves of bank B or vice versa for the difference of the amounts between bank A and B = net clearing. Usually this happens only once a day. It gets more complicated when bank A and B are not with the same central bank (multiple settlements until cleared), e.g. different FRBs or international transfers. When the bank books are maintained electronically, either on a database or on a blockchain it does not speed up money transfers, since computers and software do not replace central banks. \n\nThe only way that banks can speed up their settlements is by issuing their own R3 coin and bypassing the central bank system completely, but in the end they have to clear it for fiat again unless the public trusts this R3 coin like money, which is essentially an electronic cheque. In order to create trust, the R3 coin must represent value, so at least all R3 banks in the world must redeem it for cash within minutes. This requires that banks trust each other, which is not a constant but a variable (the interbank market collapses during a financial crisis). Another option would be public trading of the R3 coin, but trading would induce fluctuation of its fiat price and requires trust of market participants. Trust in turn requires an untrusted system, where the R3 banks cannot manipulate it. So as consequence we would end up using bitcoin.

I think under current circumstances, if this thing forks to Classic most of the holdouts will follow, and those who don't will be left holding tokens that the market does not value, but with tokens that the market does value on the other chain.\n\nThis fork to Classic is looking imminent.  Yet, most of the Core developers are still arguing about whether we should fork or not, as if they have a choice.  Clearly Core's roadmap is better, but if the chain is going to fork anyway, the better plan is to do what you say can be done: Hardfork SegWit and 2MB while adding the UTXO limits.  If this is done, this Hardfork won't be contentious and it gives Core exactly what it planned for.": 1, "> There are two ways the 2MB capacity could be reached: either hard fork in a cap increase, or soft-fork in segregated witnesses.

SegWit doesn't *need* to include a capacity increase, so we could very well do that via a hardfork and do SegWit without the side effect. Only reason to avoid the hardfork is because it's a waste of time trying to coordinate it (convincing everyone to adopt it, etc).": 1, "There's no reason the UTXO limits couldn't be added along with the 2 MB hardfork.\n\nPart of the problem with hardforks is that the *default* is that it won't happen *unless* you convince basically everyone to do it.\n\nA supermajority of the economy might be able to force a minority into submission, but the more I think about this, the less likely it seems.": 1, 'How many blocks in a row have to become full until 2MB blocks are implemented? ': 1, "There are lots of things Core has been working on this past year.  Here are a couple of interest: they have been trying to fix transaction malleability and they have been trying to implement Confidential Transactions.  The problem is both of these were thought to require a hard fork, so they have not tried to implement these, as hard forks are very risky.\n\nTransaction malleability is a design flaw caused by the fact that when a transaction is signed, not all of the data in the transaction is used for the signature.  It was discovered that this could be fixed by separating the Witness data of a transaction from the transaction data (hence Segregated Witness).  Then /u/luke-jr figured out a way to soft-fork SegWit into the chain.  The purpose of SegWit was to fix malleability, but it also came with added bonuses.\n\n1) because the witness data is separated the way the data is structured can be changed to more easily add features that were previously thought impossible in the past without a hard fork (e.g. possibly Confidential Transactions)\n\n2) Because the block cap only counts the transaction data, segregating the witness data will act as an effective capacity increase.  The increase could theoretically be up to about 4MB, but most expect the increase to effectively be the equivalent of about a 2MB cap (it depends upon its usage).\n\nAt about the time it was discovered how to Softfork Segwit in, Jtoomim (creator of Classic and proponent of BIP101) was running tests to prove that BIP101 would not break the network.  But he actually discovered what most of Core already knew; Bitcoin has serious problems related to block propagation when the blocks reach 3-4 MB (some say 2-3 MB).  Toomim presented this data at Hong-Kong and asked around and miners seemed to be happy with a 2MB cap.\n\nThere are two ways the 2MB capacity could be reached: either hard fork in a cap increase, or soft-fork in segregated witnesses.  But if bot are done, the total bandwidth requirement would be the equivalent of about a 4-8MB--too much to not harm the network.  So Core is faced with an easy choice: softfork Segwit or hard fork 2MB.  At the time, only one could be done, and clearly SegWit is the best way to go.  The plan is really brilliant.  SegWit solves several problems at once and avoids a risky hard fork.\n\nSegWit will buy the same amount of time as 2MB (possibly more).  That time can be used to work on developing IBLT.  \n\nIBLT would completely change the way blocks are propagated. Instead of requiring each node to download all of the transactions within the block, because most nodes have already had all of the transactions  stored in their mempools, the nodes will instead only download a list of transactions included in the block and then will actually build the block themselves, only downloading missing transactions from connected nodes. Implementing IBLT will so greatly reduce bandwidth requirements for block propagation that an additional cap increase would not be expected to cause the same detrimental effect (meaning the cap could be raised much higher than 2MB).\n\nSo, because there is a choice between either SegWit or 2MB, the condensed version of Core's roadmap looks like this.\n\n1) Segwit (which fixes malleability, and adds scripting function, and just so happens to add about the equivalent of 2MB of capacity) \n2) IBLT (and other stuff) \n3) then cap increase as needed (in fact, at this point, a dynamic block cap could be even less risky).": 2, "I keep trying to find evidence of this civil war in the blockchain and I can't.

When I'm talking about running out of blockspace, I'm not talking about SegWit.  I'm talking about the fact that Core's plan isn't going to provide a useful block size increase fast enough.  SegWit only provides a serious increase if everybody starts using it, and by their own admission that will take many, many months.  For miners/exchanges/payment systems/etc that run their own software, SegWit isn't just a quick change, it's a serious rewrite of how transactions are handled.  This takes a Long Time.  \nThe important part of this is that we will hit 1MB worth of real transactions before SegWit can effectively provide any serious increases to the block size.  That means we will hit a point where all the blocks are full and there are still transactions backing up.  \n\nIf we hit that, it will seriously change the way Bitcoin works for the end user, and not in a good way.  [Jeff Garzik wrote a great post talking about this](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2015-December/011973.html), it's worth your time to read.  \n\nAny fear-based arguments coming from the big block side relate to trying to avoid a situation where there is consistently more transactions than there is block space, or as Garzik puts it, a 'fee event'.  I don't think it's any LESS valid to argue the downsides of a fee event than it is to argue the downsides of a botched hard fork.  \n\nMake sense?\n\n> Let's have a peaceful secession, instead of a civil war.\n\nHow does that work?

That sounds like a terrible idea to me, it would be chaos, and merchants and users would be the ones left out in the cold.  \n\n> I think it's more a political fight over the ability to make that very determination. \n\nOkay then let's talk politics.  I'd argue that if there is going to be a significant change to how Bitcoin operates, it's not up to ANY group of developers to decide that; it should be up to the users and stakeholders and nobody else.  \nThat means if you (or anyone else, including a dev team) wants to seriously change how Bitcoin works, you go through all the steps.  You propose something on Bitcoin-Dev, you write a draft BIP, you get comments, you provide a chance for all the stakeholders to weigh in, you explain your idea to the public and let them comment, and if a majority of people agree with your idea you either get to do it or if it's a protocol change you code it and put it out for miner vote.  \n\nWhat people frequently miss is that by doing nothing, or by acting slowly, *Core is **creating** a change* even though it's not being sold as such.  The Core roadmap talks about responsible scaling, but it doesn't explain that under this roadmap, we WILL have a 'fee event' to reuse Garzik's phrase (aka, nothing in the roadmap will keep block size ahead of transaction volume).  \n\nSo that's why people want to leave Core- not because they want to replace Wladimir with Gavin as head dictator, but because they don't want a slow scaling plan to cause a change they don't want.  They want to stay in control.  \n\nMake sense?": 1, '>They have a plan that a majority of miners support. \n\nA plan? A plan that is more like an idea. The miners support a plan.

It will quickly get backlogged, and miners will switch to the new chain.  Any stale fork will die a quick death.  \n\nIn likelihood, the Core developers will realize that continuing to push for 1MB after the miners have voted is harming more than helping, so Bitcoin-Core will release a 2MB patch.  Then whatever's left of the 1MB chain will die for good.  \n\nAlso remember once the vote succeeds (750 of the last 1000 blocks voting for Classic) there's a 1 month delay period.

If that's the case, would it not be more peaceful to not have the civil war? Fork/secede and exist separately.

SegWit is an *entirely new type of transaction*.  That's not a quick bolt-on, that's something which fundamentally changes the workings of Bitcoin.  \nEven if SegWit released tomorrow, it would take many more months for the ecosystem to adopt SegWit.  Remember that it's not just nodes that need updating, it's every single hosted wallet system and payment gateway and exchange, most of whom are running their own custom software.  That means that once SegWit releases, their whole dev/test/release cycle *begins*.  \nPlus which don't forget that the effect of SegWit is heavily dependent on adoption.  That means that the primary benefit of SegWit won't happen for probably at least a year if not more.  \n\nNow you're talking about fear arguments- Core (and their supporters) are at least as guilty of this.  Why is it okay to argue that a hardfork will disrupt the network, but it's not okay to argue that running out of block space will disrupt the network?  \n\nAnd for the political argument, the only political argument I see is a disagreement over what the role of Bitcoin is and should be.

Small block supporters feel that the block size limit can be used to artificially stimulate the fee market, and most seem to support using sidechains (such as Lightning Network) to handle day-to-day transactions while Bitcoin becomes the settlement layer.  \n\nBottom line- I believe BOTH Core and Classic have solid engineering solutions, they just serve different visions of the future of Bitcoin.
