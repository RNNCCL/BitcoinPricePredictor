This allows things like multi-signature transactions or time-based transactions. (you can program transactions to happen when multiple keys sign it, or when a certain date has passed).\n\nBesides that, each bitcoin has a unique cryptographic key. \n\nAnd lastly, all of this is on what you can consider an open API: the blockchain.\n\nAnd with these three things you can essentially program money in many ways. You can parse the blockchain for transactions, and find out if you got paid. If so, you can run a program (e.g. have a drone land and drop off a package, or have a taxi door open, after a customer pays). \n\nYou don't need to develop or acquire access to a banking API to figure out if a payment happened, the money natively sits on an open API that is the blockchain.\n\nThe transactions themselves are, again, all natively happening on software. To pay, you simply run a piece of software, and you can make that as complex as you want.\n\nYou can run a food stamp program using actual money, not stamps, and put the coins into a multi-signature address. One key is held by the individual, the other by the government. Then you can run an algorithm that only signs transactions the customer makes when he's paying at one of 20 different registered grocery stores. And you can create transactions before distributing the money to automatically return to the government after 60 days, by actually publishing timelocked transactions (using bitcoin scripting). Meaning you can't hoard foodstamps, programmed into the blockchain.\n\nAnd each satoshi has a unique identifier, so it's quite possible to 'color' coins by registering them and tracking them forever.

It unlocks if you can make the script return "TRUE". So we can do all kinds of things with that script.  \n\nCurrently the script usually says "give me a private key that matches this public key". This is the traditional way of thinking about Bitcoin.  Another popular application is a "locking" script that will unlock for M of N keys. But the sky\'s the limit as far as I\'m concerned. You can think up any script you want.
