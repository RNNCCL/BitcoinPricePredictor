If these products are denominated in Bitcoin it would cause deflation, as a fixed amount of Bitcoin is used to value more and more instruments.\n\nAnd despite the fact that they can\'t create new Bitcoin, they would still be able to do leveraged, fractional reserve lending using off-chain markets.  So long as people are willing to accept their debt obligations, they can keep playing the same games.\n\nEveryone seems to know that the big banks can\'t be trusted, but each new round of evidence to that effect fails to cause a mass exodus to smaller banks and credit unions.  Most people, despite knowing better, still trust the banks with their money; from savings and checking to retirement funds, college funds, and mortgages.  I can only imagine it\'s a lack of understanding of what\'s going on and what one can do about it, coupled with a denial that the system is really so corrupt.  Apparently things are going to have to get really, *really* bad before people acknowledge how badly they\'re being fucked over.\n': 1, "What is people's QE?\n\nOnce you have the privilege to print, you will be the elite of the elite, creme de la scum.": 1, 'Everyone but us': 5, "Thanks.

Here are some areas to start exploring:\n\n1.  The Federal Reserve is not a part of the US government.  It is a private organization, a cartel of it's member banks.  Like its predecessors (the First & Second National Banks of the US), and like FNMA and Freddie Mac before they were taken over by the government during the last financial crisis, The Fed was chartered by Congress but is privately owned.  Unlike them, its ownership structure is secret, but it is widely believed that the largest current member banks own the majority of its shares.  The president nominally appoints the Fed chairman from a slate which he is given by the member banks, and ultimately if they don't like his choice, he is forced to revise it.  Obama was actually the first President to resist the the banks' selection our generation.  He was opposed to Janet Yellen's selection (and actually resisted choosing her) at first.\n\n2.  Yes, inflation favors borrowers generally, and would be injurious to lenders in a hard money system.  However, if you are the party that gets to create the inflation the effect on your loan book is irrelevant.  The whole point to our modern banking system is to inflate the the money supply (produce money costlessly).  In a fractional reserve banking system banks are simply money producers.  That's what they do via the lending process.   When a bank lends, it is only lending a small fraction of money that exists prior to the loan.  The vast majority of what it lends is written into existence upon the creation of the loan.  If you have the ability to create new money with no marginal cost of production, then you will be unaffected by inflation until hyper-inflation destroys the value of the money altogether.  Since the marginal cost of producing a dollar is zero, in a free and competitive market the producers (banks) would produce dollars until their price (value) equaled that marginal cost.  Like OPEC, the Fed exists to control the aggregate production of money via a cartel structure in order to prevent any of its members from overproducing and destroying the market.\n\n3.  Contrary to popular opinion, the derivatives to which you refer were not the cause of the financial crisis.  For more detail on what did cause the crisis read my comments in these threads:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3z1xp0/saw_the_movie_the_big_short_it_should_be/cyiyjdm?context=3 and https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/4bnci4/what_are_the_real_reasons_that_no_wall_street/d1be0rq?context=3  Derivatives in and of themselves are not harmful to an economic system.  And they are not deflationary (and deflation in a hard money economic system is a good thing BTW).  The fact that derivatives are used to cheat monetary production quotas handed out by the central banks is harmful, but the harm does not extend from the structure of the derivative, it extends from the structure of a monetary system in which money can be created with zero marginal cost.  Such creation is not possible in a Bitcoin monetary system as longs as all the functions of the monetary system remain integrated in the protocol and accessible to the individual.  The danger with the current developmental direction is that it seeks to disintegrate the monetary functions into different layers and the new layers may be far more susceptible to capture by centralized entities to exert censorship and control - as is potentially the case with the Lightning Network.\n\n4.  You correctly identified the above referenced danger to the Bitcoin presented by off-chain markets which centralize the network.  But this danger would be made irrelevant if individual users have the power to bypass the offchain solutions and effectively ignore them.  Fractional reserve banking generally doesn't work unless individual are left without options to use sound money.  This is why it's vital that we focus on onchain scaling solutions as well as offchain scaling solutions rather than consign the Bitcoin protocol to just being a settlements backbone (as was done to gold).\n\n5.  Smaller banks and credit unions cannot be trusted either - remember the S&L crisis of the 1980s (or research it if you are too young to remember).  The problem is not the size of the banks, the problem is that the entire banking system is corrupt.  And it is corrupt because it's not a free market.  The monetary and banking system is easily the most regulated market in the world, and those regulations prevent people from exercising their rights to use whatever they want as money.  The point to cryptos is to restore that balance.

How they cover up their scheme is creative I\'ll say that. But the scheme itself is pretty basic.\n\nThe banks would be able to make these toxic assets with bitcoin still, yes. But they wouldn\'t be riskless assets like they are now, due to the banks also being the mint. \n\nThe reason there is no exodus to small banks is because of burden of regulation the big banks add to every year. There are also certain products that *only* the big banks can deal in. Being a primary dealer of treasuries is the main one here, which gives them a direct line to profit. They can afford to lower prices uncompetitively on other products which make smaller banks unable to compete, because they have access to a risk free treasury flipping market.\n\nI agree it will have to get really bad before the emperor\'s seen as having no clothes.

It's an emotional relationship where the user feels some attachment to the work of the creator, and wishes to specifically support it.\n\nI don't see this as being much different other than the fact that a much larger percentage of the microtransaction is going to someone other than the content maker.\n\nOther than that, this is very much like Patreon in that you can choose to only send microtransactions to certain websites, websites that I might have an emotional connection to.

I was preemptively expressing my frustration at what my debating experiences have been like in this sub, specifically with this subject. Apologies for the unintended insult.\n\nAs for the rest, what do you know, I actually agree almost entirely with your view for the future of bitcoin. That said, of you allow my reading between your lines (and do correct me of I\'m wrong), it seems you disagree with the classic proposal on account of their proposed hard fork. If this is the case, it seems to me you\'re misplacing your mistrust on account of the fact that, with sufficient miner support, bitcoin will **always** be able to fork and change the consensus rules, at any point in the future, post v1.0 or not.\n\nI don\'t know if you\'re arguing that you intrinsically trust the current dev team to carry out a plan similar to yours, bit I\'d point out that, for the moment, they seem completely disinterested in ever setting up an infinite or even self-adjusting block-size (which the other guys do have in their roadmap after all of these improvements and more are baked in).\n\nThanks for keeping it civil.': 1, 'Yes, I disagree with classic\'s hardfork. The idea of 2MB hardfork before is incompatible with doing only one hardfork at all in Bitcoins lifetime. And yes, I do think that Core has the right mindset to pull off what I hope for. For that it is sufficient to look e.g. at their suggested sponsorship proposals (https://bitcoincore.org/en/about/sponsorship/programme/). Point 3, figure out how to make hardfork safely. Point 4, flexcap.\n\nFlexcap is a proposal for blocksize adjustments which are in principle unbound but give incentives to miners to keep it small, thus creating an equilibrium (https://scalingbitcoin.org/hongkong2015/presentations/DAY2/3_tweaking_the_chain_2_friedenbach.pdf). A lot of research will have to go there to see if this really works in the long run, but this is the type of fork that does not require a second fork the year after. No \'kick the can down the road\'.\n\nWith all this praising for core, I should make the point that the node that I run is _not_ a core node. I run btcd.\n\nAs for "bitcoin will always be able to fork" just with sufficient miner support, I guess right now is the time where it will be decided if this will be possible or not. Even 95% miner consensus will not be able to fork if the economy and community don\'t go along. Otherwise Bitcoin would not be sustainable.\n\nBasically there are two ways that a cryptocurrency can be governed. Either you set the rules and declare them fixed for ever. In that case if your rules turn out to not work in the long run, your currency dies and you lost. Or you declare the currency subject to frequent changes and continuous development. Ethereum uses this option and Monero even goes further and announces that there will be scheduled hardforks every 6 months. I am very skeptical that such a currency can be censorship resistant. Sure, there are a lot of altcoins that do this currently and it works fine for them. But that\'s because those are not in the focus of regulators (yet). If a regulator realizes that lobbying can change the consensus rules, this is an attack vector.\nThe mentioned altcoins for example, Ethereum and Monero both have in common that they have a leader. Without a leader it would be much harder to form the consensus for consensus changes, but with a leader, there is an attack point.\n\nI think Bitcoin (and thus cryptocurrency in general, again listen to Andreas Antonopolous talking about Bitcoin Maximalism for a reference) only has a chance with the first model. Don\'t change rules.\n\nIt would have been much nicer if Satoshi would have stayed around, enabling steering decisions until those are not necessary anymore. If he\'d have removed the blocksize limit before he left. He did not. Gavin talking to the CIA made him leave too early.\nSo here we are, trying to get Bitcoin out of beta. Making decisions about changes and at the same time asserting to the world that Bitcoin\'s rules are unchangeable.\nThis is difficult enough as it is, even without a faction demanding that we do a hardfork for which everybody knows it would last for one year max. In order to -and this is what also important proponents actually ask for- \'practice\' hardforks. To demonstrate that Bitcoin can adapt.\nWhy would we want that?': 1, 'One of the articles I am talking about is http://www.heise.de/ct/inhalt/2011/17/74/ . The article is behind a paywall, but the translation of title and abstract are:\n"Virtual fortune\nThe digital currency Bitcoin is a digital version of cash, which is not supervised by a central bank, but by math. The system offers good prerequisites for micropayments and anonymous payments. However, it challenges criminal prosecution institutions as much as  the established business models of banks"\n\nIt is really hard to translate this accurately. The word \'eingefahren\', which I had to translate by \'established\' for example has a very negative connotation in German.\n\nSo you see, the main focus is on \'no central bank\'. As much as I remember the article (I might be mixing up some of these statements with later articles from the same magazine though, obviously 5 years later this is hard to remember), the focus is on absolute predictability. You  can see in the preview pictures that they even show a graph of the future money supply. They bring up the scalability issue, though not the possible routes out of it.\nAnd they very clearly say that if you wanted to mine, you are already way too late for that. A claim that I luckily did not believe ;-) \n\nNo central bank means no steering. No steering means you have to stick by the rules that are set from the beginning. You must not change those rules (read to the end, I will limit this claim later). There are several rules on Bitcoin that I do not think are the best choice.\n\nLimiting the number of Bitcoin is one of them. I just don\'t think that Bitcoin needs to be deflationary. For the purpose of not being centrally planned The security will always depend on the total (including fees) block reward. When the block reward diminishes, in the deflationary choice the security has to be paid by transactions, in the inflationary case (e.g. going to constant 1% increase in coins per year) the security is paid by the hodlers. I think the latter would be preferable. I DON\'T SUGGEST TO CHANGE THAT!\n\nI think the blocksize limit at 1MB is a bad choice. As a ddos prevention, it would have been sufficient to put a limit into the propagation network instead of the consensus code. This is quite similar to what Bitcoin unlimited is trying to do. I like this idea and if I would design a currency now, this is probably what I would do. BUT I DON\'T SUGGEST TO CHANGE THE RULES!\n\nThe rules might not be perfect. And most of all, whether you consider the rules perfect or what you would change depends on your political views and your particular usecase. People talk about some sort of social contract and the spirit of it and want to change the Nakamoto consensus rules to adhere to this contract. They say that sticking by the current Nakamoto consensus rules is \'changing\' Bitcoin. The problem is, a \'social contract\' is subject to interpretation. Your interpretation includes that you don\'t want a \'fee event\'. A currency which rules are subject to interpretation is something we already have. It is the USD, EUR, GBP, CNY. I don\'t see value in creating one more. The only way to maintain the perfect predictability is to not have change in rules. Period.\n\nSo what does that leave us with. Bitcoin is probably our only attempt to establish a cryptocurrency (listen to Andreas Antonopolus talking about "Bitcoin Maximalism" on LetsTalkBitcoin for a reference for this claim) and it is broken. It does not scale. This is a problem.\n\nMy humble suggestion and hope is the following. Some rules will need to change and will need to be adaptable later. Adding more OP_codes to create new possibilities for signatures is one of them. And I _do_ want to change the blocksize, because not doing this is a blocker to the project.\n\nI hope that segwit will introduce this separation. First introduce segwit and see that it works and addresses all the issues. Then, a few month later, do one hardfork. With this hardfork, bump the version to 1.00 and make clear that there will never be a second hardfork. Ever. With this, it is clear that the transaction data part will never change again. The witness part on the other hand is what stays softfork upgradable and it seems to me that this gives all the possibilities that one will ever need to introduce Snarks, Schnorr signatures, you name it. At the same time, this hard fork will have the chance to clean up behind the softfork implementation of segwit and make the blocksize limit infinite. Either instantly or by some transparent plan for the future or by FlexCap, you name it, I don\'t care too much.\n\nThat is the Bitcoin I am hoping for.\n\nPS: In line of a constructive discussion I probably should drop this at this point, but I _do_ have some dignity. Accusing me of "undisprovable generalisations" before the fact and at the same time being guilty of just that by suggesting that _everyone_ is on your side of the argument by referring to a vision that "we all sogned up for" is quite bold.\n\nEDIT: Spelling': 1, "\n>\n* Peter Todd: Too many attack vectors.

Not at all. Has never been, could never been.\n\nThe reason is simple. For it to be part of the consensus rules a node would have to be able to say for sure if the miner chose the \'correct\' transactions into a block. For which he would have to know which transactions the miner knew about at the time of building the block. Which is clearly impossible. If it were possible to know this, that alone would be sufficient to prevent double spends and we would not need proof of work to begin with.\nThus, accepting zero confirmation transactions was _always_ broken, as Peter Todd proved in a rather impressive way against Coinbase. With a few lines of python.\nWhat replace by fee does is actually making explicit what has been possible implicitly all along. This is a repaired version of something that Mike Hearns tried to do when he put propagation of double spends into Bitcoin XT. _That_ was a stupid idea (your opinion might vary), opt-in RBF is the same thing in clever.\n\nAnd to state this as clear as possible: RBF is no fork of any type.

The current system is exactly backwards.  The kings have long since figured out how to steal from the economy without anyone even knowing it. \n\nIf I produce thing 1 and you produce thing 2, and we trade there is tax and constant debasement of our currency and no one gains. \n\nHonest money rewards every trade with added value for all parties including the network itself and the gains are huge and they compound. \n\nExample.  I produce grain and you produce chickens. \n\nI decide I have grain to sell.  The market value of my grain is 5.00.   You have a chicken to sell and the market value of the chicken is also 5 dollars.  We trade. \n\nWho gained???  Some would say no one gained. \n\nIn money of old the taxes and inflation steal any gains and the market stays stable.  A chicken stays being worth 5 dollars. (For a king price stability is a good thing,, a king needs to steal all the gains to keep prices steady.  Kings use taxes and debase currency to take this gain) (the gains are huge,  the entire government and all the roads and public works are all a part of this theft,  the theft is on a huge scale) (they are not just stealing the original gain but also taking away the compounding effect of gains on top of gains) \n\nWith honest money something different happens. \n\nI have too much grain so the marginal value of my grain to me is actually only 4 dollars.  You have too much chicken so the marginal value for you of that chicken is only 4 dollars. \n\nI trade 4 dollars of grain for 5 dollars of chicken and realize a gain.  You trade 4 dollars of chicken for 5 dollars of grain and you also realize a gain.  The value of the ability for honest trade also gains by making this honest translation possible and the value of the currency goes up a little. \n\nThis makes the price of chicken and grain go down and the value of the currency go up. \n\nBoth parties are satisfied and even if they have never actually met to make the trade everyone wins. Even the currency itself gains.  This is deflationary money and it's the natural result of trade. \n\nKings of old could not let the peasants gain so much because it would make the peasants rich very fast because the effects compound.   Things get cheaper and quality of life goes up. \n\nSo they flipped the system over and made it work backwards.  \n\nBitcoin is honest money and removes the layer of theft that currently exists with fiat. \n\nWe will all gain every time a trade takes place.  The value of the network grows and each trader trades up.  \n\nWe all win.  We stop the theft.  \n\nNo one should need a reason beyond that.  Every civillization that was the center of trade flourished.  \n\nTrade equals mutual benifit as long as the money is honest.  \n\nWe currently have a dishonest system.  An honest system would reward all the producers and all the consumers.  And actually the producers and investors and savers would have an advantage.  \n\nIt would also reward efficiency.   Savings would go up in value and the longer you wait to buy a new TV the cheaper it becomes. \n\nAny free market will cycle and that's ok.   Traders would suck up the fluctuations in arbitrage and futures etc.  \n\nMoney is not supposed to be stable.   We need to learn the art of the deal and negotiation. \n\nMoney is deflationary naturally.  It took a great deal of effort to flip the system over to work backwards.  The good news is that it's very easy to return the system to its natural state. \n\nYou can damn up the Mississippi River, temporarily.
