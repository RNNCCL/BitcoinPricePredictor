The seals are hologram stickers. They\'re broken which indicates someone opened the sealed box the USB devices come in.\n\nPeople have various theories about why, around the world, these are being opened up. \n\nThey\'re not being covertly opened, which just means that the fact it\'s been opened means that the mail is being at least inspected. \n\nHow far this has gone, like - did they plug the USB drive into something to read the contents? Or did they X-Ray it? Or did they put new replacement - Trojan Horse - firmware onto the device? I saw a theory that the words "Mycelium" (something associated with mushrooms) might have made Customs think it was about drugs. And maybe they know it\'s about bitcoin. And maybe they think it\'s a USB device which could have illegal porn on it. \n\nI think that because the opening is not covert, and the device might have been tampered with, a medium course of safety is to flash/replace the firmware. After that, how trustworthy it is depends on how paranoid you are.\n\nThe NSA for sure has a group called TAO - Tailored Access Operations - check out the Wikipedia article on it - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tailored_Access_Operations\n\nI think that at this point, it\'s an up in the air - but in my opinion a "no" - as to whether or not the NSA has their own Trojan Horse firmware for these devices, or if the entire device has been covertly replaced with a completely Trojan Horse usb device.\n\nThat would be similar to having the NSA intercept or try to get the secret seeds for Entrust / SecurID hardware tokens. Have they done that? 99% chance of a YES to that. \n\nBut have they done that for these little Mycelium things? I\'d say less than a 1% chance they\'ve got TAO on it.\n\nIf you use a Windows, Mac, Linux, Chromebook computer to deal with bitcoin - that\'s where your real weak point is. \n\nSo for me, the Mycelium is probably still trustworthy-ish - as-is.

I\'m sure there\'s a script out there that will spit out \'x\' number of deposit addresses from a given seed word list. Capture those addresses and convert them into QR codes. Place 10,000 of those QR codes on an SD card inserted into a picture frame and then configure the picture frame to cycle through all of the pictures in random order.

Will the cache nodes cache all that for me?\n\nRemember that the more data you store, the more nodes it will be stored on, so the more caches that will come into play.  So, potentially, the answer to your question is "yes".  However, when we start talking exabytes of data, my mind sort of shifts gears to the personal cost to you of your attack.  You have to pay to store those exabytes of data, before you can start your attack.  2000 or 3000 terabytes of data will cost you something fairly non-trivial to store, even on the safe network.  If that amount of data is required for your attack, it will be a real investment for you to carry it out.  We don\'t know what the dollars per gigabyte of storage will be on the safe network, because it will be constantly adjusting.  However, I believe it will be no less than $0.20 per gigabyte.  So, 3 exabytes of data is 3,000,000 GB of data, which will cost you $600,000 to store, before you begin your attack.  If it\'s closer to $0.30, you\'re up to $900,000. \n\nAsk your question on the forum.

To understand why, let me add a little detail.\n\nThe data is chunked into 1MB chunks.  Each chunk is stored on a random vault on the network.  So if you store an excel spreadsheet containing your tax information, that spreadsheet will be encrypted and chunked and scattered to random vaults.  None of it will reside on your PC.  Those chunks are then duplicated so a minimum of 4 copies of them always exist on the network.  (When a node goes down, the data in it is duplicated immediately from the remaining 3 nodes, so there are always 4 nodes containing your data)  When you go to read that excel file, it\'s assembled from the multiple chunks residing in the hundreds of vaults that pieces of it it was stored on. \n\nThe attack you describe, of setting up multiple accounts, storing data with them, and then attempting to read that data multiple times would be difficult, due to the improbability of you controlling any of the vaults that contain any of the data that you stored.   It moves from difficult to impossible, however, because of caching.  After you read the data once, it resides in the caches of the nodes between the requesting account and the vault account.  The vault account will not be paid for duplicate reads, since those reads never make it that far.  They get answered by the cached copies.  You could wait several seconds to a minute, and ask for the data again, of course, which gives the caches time to forget your last request, but that slows down your attack to the point of being useless.\n\n': 3}, ('Bitappo - Looking for developers', 1): {}, ('Helping non techies send money to Mexico', 7): {'Good call.

Perhaps you can find an incompetent exchange, but any careful organization will be watching for double-spends and rapidly suspend credited funds once discovered.

I get so annoyed with people so impatient for faster validation solutions they're willing to overlook or be ignorant of double spend risks.\n\nThat said, I would add at this stage in Bitcoin's life, with block reward of approximately $6K of value, it's a fair financial risk for miners to withhold found block information to collude in a double spend. The transaction in question would need to be of comparable value to risk it, as each passing second would mean higher risk of losing the $6K reward.\n\nI like to tell people, for simplification, always get at least 1 confirmation, as that will nullify most possible fraud attempts, and more confs are better.

Exceptionally hard to do, but not unheard of (for example, the tor network could *relatively* easily be sheltered from the 'real' bitcoin network, and be presented with a parallel chain instead.

Not exactly.\n\nThere is a little more to this when you enter humans into the equation. Humans, as we know, are imperfect and driven by fear and greed, especially when acting together in groups. This has an effect on the market by amplifying moves in one direction, creating a snowball effect that eventually climaxes with great dramatic effect. The more illiquid the market, the less there is to stop these moves. \n\nBitcoin's rise to $1200 was an example of this, as was the rise to $266 in April 2013. Humans were blinded by greed and optimism, and pushed the price higher and higher until panic set in and the price went parabolic. This high price is unsustainable as many holders sell and there is not enough buyers to keep the price up. \n\nThis buying climax sets up the bear market to follow, and has a snowballing effect in the opposite direction as fear grips the market and investors begin to unload at a loss. At some point, panic sets in again and sellers let go at a huge loss having seen their investment fizzle away over the course of the year. The crash to $166 is a good candidate for this, which marks the beginning of the end of a bear market. \n\nThis is a cycle that will repeat, in varying degrees, as adoption continues.

On the other hand, this makes changing\nfees after the fact trivial, and it lets us implement a limited 'undo'\nbutton for when people screw up.\n\nIn other words, they want random users who didn't set a high enough fee to be able to resend, and allow undoing transactions.\n\nIt doesn't seem to me to be specifically for merchants based on this and other stuff I've read.

Not a node, not a miner, not your dog or your neighbour.\n\nWhen you broadcast a transaction to the network you would typically 'sign' it *using* your private key. This signature proves you are the owner of the private key, without ever showing the actual key, to anyone.\n\nSpecifically, this technology is ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm). It's been around for many years and can be compared to RSA, which has been around for even longer (since the 70s). The school of cryptography this is part of, is asymmetric cryptography.\n\nPut simply, you have 2 keys. One is private (known only to you), the other is public (potentially known to anyone). You can compute the public key if you have the private key, but you cannot 'get back' to the private key, if all you have is the public key.\n\nAdditionally, you can *encrypt* data using either key, and *decrypt* it with the other.\n\nSo, let's say I want to prove to you I am the owner of a private key, without ever showing the private key to you, I would do this:\n\nI will provide to you the public key which I have computed from my private key. I will then give you some plain ptext/data, which I will 'sign'(/encrypt) using my private key. I will also give you the signed(/encrypted) form of this text.\n\n*If* you can then successfully decrypt the encrypted data I've sent you (using the public key), and it is equal to the plain text I told you I would sign, then I *must* be the owner of the private key.\n\nThe same, basically, happens while creating a transaction. Every transaction is accompanied by signatures that prove the money that transaction is spending comes from a source which is legitimate. If not, the transaction is invalid and will be rejected by the network.\n\nIt's a little more complicated than that (for example, typically you won't even expose the *public* key until you spend your bitcoin while still proving you are the owner of the private key), but this is the gist of it.": 2, 'Thanks for the info': 1, "> So if the merchant owned a widely connected node, it would largely mitigate the first 3 risks right?\n\nIt wouldn't mitigate the first. If miners collude with a fraudster the network would never know a transaction is being double spent until the block shows up, which is when it's too late.\n\nThe last point could be solved by replace-by-fee-scorched-earth, which is that a merchant, in response to a double-spend attempt, would double-spend the double-spend using an even higher fee, which would eventually render the payment nil. It would cost the fraudster the full amount, and the merchant would get nothing. Idea being: no incentive for a fraudster to fraud. Whether that'll work: meh. The idea is very interesting, but as far as I'm concerned it's not ideal.

Then if you're willing to wait *x* blocks, it will give you an estimate by looking at all transactions that took *x* blocks to confirm and returning the median of their fees. So when you give Bitcoin Core the command `estimatefee 1` and it returns 0.00089285 (that's how I made my table), what this means is that among all transactions that got confirmed in the next block after being broadcast, the median fee was 0.00089285 BTC per KB.\n\nAs I mentioned, these estimates do sound somewhat high to me.

In fact I\'m struggling with money being favors detached from persons.\n\nThink of it this way: 8000 years ago, 99% of humanity lived in societies small enough to know everybody. Less than 150 people per group. No global ledger was needed. Groups started experimenting with more local ledgers like shells but it wasn\'t that essential. People knew who they owed to and who owed them. Same as it probably works in your family. You sweep the floor without keeping a ledger of who owes you to sweep the floor next. In such an informal society, ledgers are quite subjective and can gain and loose rapidly. Massively abnormal behavior might lead to loosing all your favors in a day (by killing a member of the group). Also you might win a million favors in a day (by saving the lives of the group). Inheritance of favors on the other hand was on probation: If the son was an arrogant prick, he might loose all his father\'s favors the day the father died. Some might still remember the honor of the father and give him credit but with time, the son will lose a million favors rapidly.\n\nWith cold hard money this is not the case. You can inherit a ton of gold and your villain son will be able to redeem it at face value. If people know about his wealth and bad intentions, they might charge him more than they would charge a good, modest person but ultimately the more money you have, the better you can navigate the market and communicate your offer such that you get the best price.\n\nI wish there was a way to enhance economy such that people can discriminate against anti-bad behavior ("bad" being something different for many people). I want to boycott the bad actors and support the good ones, at least after I took a decision to put them into the one or the other category but our global economy where the environmentalist Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation holds Shell stocks and the local bakery got bought by Wall Mart last week, I can\'t know who makes a profit from me acting the one way or the other.\n\nI want to regain my power to decide to whom I owe a favor \xe2\x80\x93 or at least to whom I don\'t.': 11, 'Fair enough but there was a survey on here not too long ago that showed that the vast majority of people here got involved in that time frame.

Something like: In the beginning there was a Genesis block of transactions and every 10 minutes there is another block that\xe2\x80\x99s added to the previous block, forming a chain of blocks.\n\nCover the 2 blocks to the right and focus on explaining public/private key crypto.\n\nAs you can see from the diagram the previous transaction is combined with the public key (which is mathematically linked to the receiver\xe2\x80\x99s bitcoin address) and then hashed.\n\nThis hashing is done so that the receiver of the transaction can verify it really did come from the sender\xe2\x80\x99s address and that the ledger has not been fraudulently altered. It can be mathematically proven easily by computing the hash independently.\n\nOf course the Bitcoin client software does the checking automatically, but the theory is sound.": 2, '35,000 foot view:\n\nImagine a set of vacuum tubes like at a bank drive through where you put a container in, and it is whisked away.  Each tube leads to a secret location that only the owner of the tube knows.  When someone wants to give you something, you tell them what tube is yours.  They put in the box, and it ends up where only you know where it is.\n\n20,000 foot view:\n\nEach transaction defines a "puzzle" that describes what must be done to spend it.\n\n\n10,000 foot view:\n\nThe receiver of a transaction can reveal information to the spender that allows the sender to create a puzzle that only the receiver can spend.\n\n5,000 foot view:\n\nYou have a public key hash (address) that you can share with anyone that corresponds to the "tube" you put things in.  You control a private key that allows you to access the place the tube leads to.\n': 2}, ('Book Review \xe2\x80\x93 The Age of Cryptocurrency: How Bitcoin and Digital Money are Challenging the Global Economic Order', 0): {}, ('LazyCoins Goes \xe2\x80\x9cFAST\xe2\x80\x9d With New UK Banking Partnership', 2): {"It's good news!": 1, 'Getting licensed as a MSB means nothing, even being fully FCA regulated means nothing.\n\nThe only real value is a banking relationship which they do claim, however refuse to disclose (kind of pointless seeing as only the sort code is needed to find out the bank).\n\nThere have been other UK exchange startups that have failed because their "banking relationship" was fake, in that the bank didn\'t actually know they were operating a bitcon exchange, only time will tell here.': 0, 'Please stop pretending to be a random user.
