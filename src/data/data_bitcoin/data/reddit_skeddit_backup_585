All the references are to the 26th Title to the United States Code, known as the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. It is tax law.\n\nSection 1001(a). Gain (loss) is the amount realized (cash, goods, altcoins at USD FMV) less the adjusted basis.\nhttp://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/1001\n\nAdjusted basis is defined in Section 1011(a) as what is stated in 1012.\nhttp://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/1011\n\nSection 1012 states that basis is cost, except as where otherwise provided. Now feel free to put your self to look for crypto currency in the IRC, but you will not find it otherwise provided. The only guidance that exists states the Bitcoin is treated generically as property in Notice 2014-21.  \nhttp://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/1012\nhttp://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-14-21.pdf\nSo gain (loss) is simply what you made selling a Bitcoin versus what you paid. But how much tax do you owe? First, we need to figure out if Bitcoin is capital property. Let\'s take a peek at Section 1221. Sec. 1221 says everything is capital property except for certain things like inventory or accounts receivable (important in a business context but not here). \nhttp://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/1221\nSo how much tax do you owe? Flip your leather bound copy of the Internal Revenue Code (autographed by Ronald Reagan himself!) to Section 1(h), colorfully called "Tax imposed." It states that the bottom two tax brackets pay no tax, the middle two only pay 15% of the amount of the gain and the highest pay 20%. \nhttp://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/1\n\nKeep in mind this is for long term gains, which are defined in Section 1222(3) as being from property held longer than a year. So you need to really hold to get preferential tax treatment. If they\'re held for less than a year it\'s ordinary income. \nhttp://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/1223\n\nSo for example, Ross Ulbricht buys 10,000 Bitcoins for $40 in early 2010. He then sells them in December 2013 for $1,100/coin, realizing and recognizing a $10,999,960 long term capital gain on the sale. Assuming he\'s in the top tax bracket, he pays $2,199,992 in capital gains tax, along with the 3.8% Net Investment Income Tax of $417,998.48. \n\nThat\'s how it works.

One or more of these currencies will dominate the point-of-sale arena. Maybe that currency doesn\'t exist yet, but to even suggest that teams of developers and visionaries aren\'t already trying to get a foothold in that inevitable future is, quite frankly, incredibly naive.\n\nps - it\'s not usually my style to stoop to insults in online discussions, but seriously, you\'re insane if you honestly believe there isn\'t a fantastic race already underway to be the dominant provider of blockchain-backed point-of-sale solutions on a global scale.\n': 1, "Bitcoin currently has a 1 MB limit on each block.

I am reluctant to share too many details, but based on the questions you\'re asking, you can probably guess at a few of them (and come up with several we haven\'t thought of).\n\nHedging is actually one of the primary uses for the UltraCoin app. Assuming we achieve do our job and increase market liquidity, even today the functionality exists for unsophisticated parties to periodically allocate some portion of their bitcoins to mid-term swaps in favor of a fiat currency.\n\nIn following your example, let\'s consider a US retail merchant who decides to accept bitcoins for her goods or services. She could, at the end of every week, take 50% of the bitcoins she received that week, put them in her UltraCoin wallet, and commit them to one or more six month swaps where she receives US dollars in terms of BTC ([USDBTC=X](https://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=USDBTC=X)), or pays BTC in terms of US dollars ([BTCUSD=X](https://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=BTCUSD=X)). As a sort of "hack" if one only wants exposure to one asset rather than two, one can use US dollars valued in US dollars ([USDUSD=X](https://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=USDUSD=X), which is always 1.000) as a constant for the other asset.\n\nAfter several months, she would have rolling swaps insulating her from some of her exposure to Bitcoin volatility. For any given swap, if bitcoins go up in terms of US dollars, she takes a notional loss on her bitcoins. If they go down, she makes a notional gain. Either way, the portion of her wallet committed to those swaps doesn\'t lose value in terms of US dollars (minus the swap fees).\n\nShe could do the same for (paper) gold:\n\nReceive: [GLD](https://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=GLD) (ETF valued in terms of USD)\n\nPay: BTCUSD=X (BTC in terms of USD)\n\nOr she could put some portion in GLD/BTCUSD=X swaps and some portion in USDBTC=X/USDUSD=X swaps, etc.\n\nThere are some very interesting trades out there. This isn\'t investment advice of course, but let\'s say you saw [this](http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2015-01-29/either-oil-soars-back-88-or-energy-stocks-have-tumble-over-40) and wanted to bet on rising oil prices or falling energy stock values. You could receive [\\^SPGSCI](https://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=%5eSPGSCI) and pay [\\^GSPE](https://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=%5eGSPE) or [\\^NYE](https://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=%5eNYE). Either way, you\'d likely be in the money for those trades if you entered sometime around the beginning of February (see [here](https://finance.yahoo.com/echarts?s=^GSPE+Interactive#{%22range%22%3A%225d%22%2C%22scale%22%3A%22linear%22%2C%22comparisons%22%3A{%22^SPGSCI%22%3A{%22color%22%3A%22%23cc0000%22%2C%22weight%22%3A1}}}) and [here](https://finance.yahoo.com/echarts?s=^NYE+Interactive#{%22range%22%3A%225d%22%2C%22scale%22%3A%22linear%22%2C%22comparisons%22%3A{%22^SPGSCI%22%3A{%22color%22%3A%22%23cc0000%22%2C%22weight%22%3A1}}}), although sometimes Yahoo\'s charting interface can be a bit flaky).\n\nWith leverage, it gets even more interesting. Let\'s say you had 1 BTC you wanted to invest, and wanted to engage in the oil/energy trade above, but also wanted to be insulated from BTC/USD volatility. You could place the following trades:\n\nTrade 1:\n\n* Principal 0.5 BTC\n* Receive \\^SPGSCI\n* Pay \\^NYE\n* Leverage 2x\n\nTrade 2:\\*\n\n* Principal 0.5 BTC\n* Receive USDBTC=X\n* Pay USDUSD=x\n* Leverage 2x\n\n> \\* Trade 2 works to a point. If BTC in terms of USD rises a lot and very quickly, your entire position 0.5 BTC position could be wiped out, so there\'s a cliff that you have to be aware of. But in this scenario, a little of that pain would be absorbed if Trade 1 makes money, since the BTC gains for that trade would be worth that much more in terms of USD.\n\nThese are just some of the ways the UltraCoin app can be used to tackle hedging or arbitrage situations right now. Though we understand it\'s a bit manual and error prone in the hands of a beginner. We\'re working on enabling or making much simpler these and many other scenarios. This is really just the beginning for us.': 3, 'Yours is an excellent point. Even the name "swap" carries with it legacy baggage. One of the most universal problems that accompanies making something new is how to talk about it. We often construct metaphors from things we already have names for, which work...until they don\'t (i.e., until the abstraction is no longer consistent with the reality of the new thing). This can be jarring. When a misunderstanding results in an unexpected loss of value, that\'s especially unpleasant.\n\nUltraCoin swaps have a lot of "knobs" (another metaphor) that we\'ve struggled to label in ways that are accurate, but don\'t take hours to explain, especially to those who have heard of Bitcoin, but aren\'t intimately familiar with the blockchain.\n\nClearly, this is an ongoing effort. :o)': 3, 'One way to emulate this today is to scale down the principal, but ramp up the collateral in proportion. Something like:\n\n*p\'* = *p* x *s*\n\n*c\'* = (1/*s* - 1) x (*c* + 1)\n\nWhere:\n\n*s* is the "softened" leverage; 0 < *s* < 1\n\n*p* is the original principal\n\n*c* is the original collateral\n\n*p\'* is the "softened" principal\n\n*c\'* is the "softened" collateral\n\n(At least I *think* that\'s right, but it\'s late, and I haven\'t double checked my work. This is all the more reason to adopt your suggestion, so users don\'t have to risk screwing up the math like I probably just did.)\n\nFor example, to emulate 0.1x leverage for a trade with 1 BTC as principal and no collateral, one could place a trade with 0.1 BTC and 900% collateral. Either way, 1 BTC will be committed to the trade, but profit and loss for the second will be in proportion to the principal of 0.1 BTC rather than 1 BTC for the first.\n\nIn fact, there are a number of ways to set up equivalent trades that may not be matched with each other. (Which I\'m not sure is a bug or a feature. I\'ll have to think on that.)\n\nFundamentally, what\'s the different between: a 1 BTC trade with no collateral or leverage; and a 0.1 BTC trade with 900% collateral and 10x leverage?': 3, "That was actually something that we were going to implement. You're on your toes, my friend!": 2, "Sounds intriguing.  I like the hard limits you've placed.  Unfortunately, I see a lot of youngsters losing their BTC wallets this way.

I'd have to run some simulations to make sure it was acting how I'd hope, but the idea is that someone (probably a business) could hold BTC in a relatively long-term position, while not experiencing the deepest lows or the highest of highs.  But maintain something of a 6-month trailing average, free to exit at anytime.  Basically buying themselves some risk-aversion.\n\n\nIf it's possible to put together a product like that (I'm not sure what position a counterparty would need to take to make it work) I could see some conservative individuals using it as well as *many* businesses.  In fact, if you get the maths worked out, it would likely be good to partner with BitPay or Coinbase, either of which would bring a lot of liquidity to your platform.  Maybe license them an API?  I don't know.\n\n\nRight now, most Bitcoin merchants are immediately dumping their BTC for fiat, because they can't handle the risk.  But I'm sure that some of them would like to keep some earnings in BTC, if the risk can be managed.  I'm sure you guys will figure something out.  Best Wishes!": 2, 'Absolutely excellent job explaining the capabilities of the system. You were actually being a bit humble, so let me step in.

That means we can take positions directly in indices - something that your local broker can\'t offer you. \n\nSo, using your example above, that same lady can hedge her holdings, or more accurately, her transactions in gold by going long (receiving) the volatility of gold ^GVZ and going short (paying) either USDUSD=x (for a pure play on spot gold price volatility) or GLD (to speculate on gold prices dropping - or - she can go long GLD and short GVZ if she feels the currency wars in soveriegn fiat will cause gold to spike without a reciprocal drop in the near term. If that will happen, then volatility will drop as GLD prices climb. If where were to enter into a 10x lever on that trade, the leverage effect would be materially increased in relation to trading one asset against the relatively stable dollar, for she will get he gain for GLD and the effect of a successful short for the ^GVZ, all multiplied by her 10x leverage - of course bounded by the limits she set with her principal and collateral contributions.

The devices you can use to contribute to scientific research include CPU, GPU, Android, R-Pi, and ASICs with more being added all the time.  The goal of the project is to design a system that diverts compute power from wasteful hashing to productive computing, creating a Supercomputer cluster that supports all kinds of scientific investigation and technology development.\n\nAccess to Supercomputer clusters have traditionally been restricted to large research universities and corporations.  By creating a large network of computers complex computations previously out of reach for most researchers in the past are now possible.  Creating a network of computers to run complex computations isn't a new idea, in fact Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing or BOINC has been around since 2002 and has many volunteer contributors allowing researchers to tap the enormous processing power of personal computers.  However, the network is limited by those willing to volunteer, until now.\n\nCryptocurrency has created a fast, efficient and most importantly inexpensive way to account and move value from point A to point B.  A few coins have recently attempted to create a compensation mechanism to increase participation.  Notably Ripple, Curecoin, and Research Support Coin have used a centralized approach to distribute rewards to participants.  The weakness in this approach is in fact the centralized distribution.  This approach is reliant on what the makers deem worthy and participants must trust that the makers will continue their support.\n\nOne of the many things that make Gridcoin unique is it's decentralized approach to compensating individuals for participation.  A consequence of this approach is that it also opens the door  for commercial entity's to tap the same network without the overhead of a massive compute cluster and can use the coin as a compute credit for access to the network.  This would create a compute cluster that directly competes with cloud based compute services offered by Microsoft, Google, and Amazon but instead of the reward going into the pockets of large corporations it will be distributed to network participants of all sizes.\n\nDevelopment happens at a break-neck speed, one of the most often heard complaints is actually the speed at which development takes place with upgrades coming so regularly.  It is also a very community driven project, with input taken from the community to make the network better.  Some projects that have been started but need more attention/resources and could benefit from a campaign like this include a financial analysis BOINC project (finance.gridcoin.us) and a distributed database that can be used for a variety of services including in wallet voting, notifications, trouble ticket tracking and blockchain analytics to name a few.  \n\nThe future looks bright for Gridcoin, with or without this campaign but with the extra resources and attention this would help move the project forward and help change the way people think about mis-appropriated and underutilized compute resources.\n\n": 3, "I'd like to see BitMesh come into existence.
