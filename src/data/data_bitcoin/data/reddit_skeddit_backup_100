Security upgrades against systemic risks is another one of those agreements. For example, most would agree on not changing the POW algorithm. This is a fundamental part of how the system works. This is unless SHA-256 is deemed to be unsafe. If it is, then most everyone would agree to change the algorithm in order to secure the system. \n\nThis issue is similar. The destruction of coins is a forbidden part of the Bitcoin agreement in any normal circumstances.

To get a "fast confirmation" for a 10$ purchase a 0.10$ fee is 1% and a fee of 0.25$ is 2.5%. That jump sure is big for "ants".

This would make bitcoin much less attractive to those who would like to use it for Point of Sale purchases at corner stores, restaurants, and caf\xc3\xa9s...\n\nThe fee bump would have little direct impact on those who are making large (3 digit plus) USD purchases, those who buy and sell bitcoin in large amounts, and those using it for settlement purposes.
