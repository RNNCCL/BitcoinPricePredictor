Support was spotty if you could get help at all.  It took 4 days for my support ticket and tweets and reddit post to be addressed.  This huge increase happened across the board and long term regular loan customers with A ratings were affected as well.  One user had his regular 7 day loan jump from .85% yield to 16.45%.   The result is good loan seeking customers are pulling out going to other platforms offering more competitive interest rates.  I am leaving BTCJam also and predict that there will be an increased percentage of scammers because they don;t care what the interest rate is sine they won't be paying the loan back anyways.  So invest there with caution and be particular who you invest in.  This may not make the new auto invest option the best technique although it is much easier than manually reviewing each potential investment.  BTCJam doesn't have a user forum so us users had to use a loan comment thread or two to try to make sense of the recent changes implemented without warning.  If you would like more information you view these threads [here](https://btcjam.com/listings/43515-why-i-paid-2000%25-higher-interest,-&-doing-it-again%3F-please-read,-don%E2%80%99t-rush-to-invest) and [here](https://btcjam.com/listings/43455-why-i-am-paying-2000%25-higher-interest%3F-find-out).  Also in light of the recent interest rate changes I would recommend investing in the longer term loans at this point, as more of the legit users will be opting for these terms since they are a bit more reasonable.\n\nI just noticed that BTCJam is no longer the listing the APR of the loans but have replaced it with a yield percentage.  This change was made within the last 2 days. The APR of the 2 loans linked above were listed at 857% .   Good luck investing over there and be careful.\n\nedit: I was mixing up yield and apr here and have corrected it: form .85 APR to over 800% -> .85% yield to 16.45%.": 15, 'We have made changes to the interest rates as we updated the model last week.

No-- you\'re just calling out to a third party site and trusting the response, it\'s basically impossible to do anything else without being more complex.\n\nThere are methods to do similar things in a way that makes it harder for the seller to cheat-- for them to fail to deliver the image once paid, or for the image to fail to be what the user expected.  But they require much more software complexity. Fortunately, software can be written once and that cost can be amortized across a lot of reuse.  (If "the software is complex" were the most important cost requirement... bitcoin would certainly never have existed.)\n\n> Link?\n\nIt\'s described in #bitcoin-wizards (and I think someplace on BCT but finding the post is a PITA). I\'ll see if I can give a brief sketch of the general idea; so you can see the kind of trade-off it entails.\n\nTake the image, make 1000 copies.\n\nFor each copy, use a deterministic RNG and randomly split the pixels into two sets (so you now have two images where half the pixels are black, and if you add them up you get the complete image).\n\nEncrypt each of the 2000 images with a different random key each. Publish them, publish SHA256(key)s.  And form a bitcoin transaction that commits to the hash of all this data (ideally this would also be putting up some timelocked funds, but we\'ll ignore for now), along with a description of the full scheme and the parameters.\n\nShow users the confirmed transaction and then use the block hash in a way described in the scheme to select exactly one of the images and reveal its decryption key.  Now users have a bunch of the pixels and can use it to check that it contained the pixels it should have contained and reconstruct a low quality copy of the image (e.g. using compressed sensing software). If they think they\'d like the other half of the pixels,  they can form a hash locked transaction using the hash of the other key,  where you must reveal the hash to collect the coins; they could even make this payment lighthouse-style to get many people to fund it.   When you collect the coins, you\'ll reveal the decryption key that lets them get the other half of the pixels.\n\nAdditional complexity can be invoked to make this more efficient.  Parameters can be selected to trade-off various overheads (e.g. adjust the odds that the sender could manage to successfully get a dummy image in the non-selected slot), it\'s not hard to extend this to give less than half of the pixels (e.g. obvious way is to split into groups of N and require N-1 preimages for the hashlock), so you can get a truly low resolution version.\n\nMain attacks are that someone could take a low resolution image, upscale, and add noise and distinguishing that from samples of a truly high res image from a small number of samples is not completely reliable.  On way around that would be to make multiple payments, each getting more pixels with a small amount.\n\nI don\'t mean to suggest that this (or other similar approaches) is the best way to transfer images; perhaps it actually sucks. But it would be something uniquely Bitcoin in a way that using BC.i as a payment processor is not.\n': 6, 'Ah - thats trivial for anyone forking this.': 1, "I think they can make more. imagine 100k people, all donating 0.0001btc that's 10btc per image.

In response, Fred Wilson, a partner at New York-based Union Partners, described such costs as a huge barrier to entry that encouraged venture-capital firms like his to concentrate on established players that were already well down that compliance path.\n\nBitcoin advocates were happy when a second BitLicense draft that was released in February rolled back stricter regulatory constraints contained in the first draft published in July. However, they continued to harbor specific concerns.\n\nThe bitcoin business leaders complained that the BitLicense\xe2\x80\x99s anti-money-laundering provisions, as written in the February draft, could unfairly apply to all developers of so-called wallets, which are software applications that give people direct control over their bitcoins, whereas controls should only be imposed on those services with custody of customers\xe2\x80\x99 bitcoins and dollars. The group also said the draft\xe2\x80\x99s rule requiring NYDFS approval of updates to a provider\xe2\x80\x99s software was impractical in an industry that makes product changes weekly.\n\nMr. Lawsky said such concerns were misplaced. \xe2\x80\x9cWe make it crystal clear that we are not going to regulate software providers or software creators or people doing code.

Describing this as a quirk of New York law, he said \xe2\x80\x9cyou will be able to file just one application for both and you will be able to cross-satisfy so that even in those duplication cases you don\xe2\x80\x99t have to do the paperwork twice.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe also vowed to work with other states so that prior NYDFS approval of shareholder structure changes and other reporting requirements could help expedite approvals in those jurisdictions. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have done a lot of work and hopefully we will be able to have some influence\xe2\x80\x9d over other state regulators, Mr. Lawsky said.\n\nThe BitLicense comes as interest grows on Wall Street in new applications for virtual currencies\xe2\x80\x99 blockchain ledger technology.

Here's a stream of my solar miner in action in Nicaragua. It's a bit overcast today so you will get to see how it handles cloudy weather.  The focus is a bit off, sorry. Also, there seems to be no audio, not sure why.\n\nI'm happy to present the world's first cost effective solar mining solution:\nhttps://streamium.io/app/#/join/solar-mining": 8, 'Thanks Jeff :) ': 1, 'And he was one click away from starting a second Iranian Revolution.': 4, 'I commend you for giving this gift to the community.

This fund could provide legal protection to those who are kidnapped and held hostage by the state and other institutional aggressors for non-payment of protection money and also for victimless crimes.  This fund would also create a DAO which would create a decentralized marketplace for legal services and claims adjusting.
