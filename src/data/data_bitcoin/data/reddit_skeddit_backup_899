I've told you over and over again that creditcards are a 1940s insecure system where you must give all details to access your bank account to anyone you want to pay. Anything is more secure, bitcoin, but also cash or Paypal. Creditcards suck from a security point of view, this is pretty much a universally agreed upon opinion. But it's got strong network effects so we get path dependency despite better products (and I'm not just talking about bitcoin) existing.\n\nSecond, I'm NOT dismissing insurance at all. You're putting words in my mouth. My point is that it doesn't make sense to have a system that allows easy and rampant fraud in the billions affecting a third of credit card holders, costing consumers and businesses money, and then just solve it by slapping insurance on it. \n\nInsurance is awesome, it prevents a single guy from going bankrupt because his risk is shared among greater numbers. BUT IT DOES NOT MAKE THE COST GO AWAY. \n\nThat's my point on insurance. I have insurance myself on lots of things, I love it. But if you build me a house that has a 5% annual chance of exploding and say 'but you're insured', I have all the right in the world to say it's a shit house and that the insurance doesn't solve that problem. On average the system (including myself) is paying 5% on average per year for exploded houses, even if my house didn't explode that year. That's the point. Insured creditcards is not some magic free service, it's costing us all money, and we need this insurance because fraud is so rampant. \n\nBut then there's the second point which is that the insurance itself invites a lot of other problems. Again, agency problems. If I know I'm insured I have a new angle for fraud (spend, claim a skimmed card, get a refund). And it also invites carelessness. (Target has a breach affecting 110m creditcard holders? Who cares, I'm insured. As a customer, I don't demand a better security system from Target, I continue shopping there.) So while insurance is awesome, it's not free, and it perpetuates and even magnifies the problem. \n\nThe solution then is NOT to keep on insuring a shitty system. The solution is a better system, and you can then insure that if you want (it'll cost less, have less fraud, less risk and it'd still be insured), just like Circle or Xapo or Coinbase are offering bitcoin insurance now.\n\n": 1, 'Because bitcoin has never been stolen.

(the creditcard number). If you pay 1000 different people, there are now 1000 people who essentially have the key to your money, the password to your money vault, the information they need to steal any amount of money they would like.\n\nThat means you now have to trust these 1000 different people not to steal your money.

A HYIP scam is a Ponzi scheme. What Huobi is offering is a bond to pay for a bitcoin mining farm that pays a 2.4% interest after 60 days (14.4% APR).

The Dig-VC shares are nothing more than bonds for the purpose of obtaining capital to pay for a mining farm.\n\nThere are 2000 shares. Each paying 2.4% IN BITCOIN over 60 days. That means Houbi only needs to pay back 48 bitcoins in interests. A total of 2048 bitcoins.\n\nThe mining farm can generate around 28 bitcoins per day. So in 60 days the farm will generate 1680 bitcoins.\n\nThat means Houbi only needs to pay back 368 bitcoins out of pocket in order to pay for the principal and interests. And Houbi has well over 368 coins, as they have 103% in reserves.\n\nAfter that, it will only take about 2 weeks for the mining farm to generate the 368 bitcoins Houbi had to pay out of pocket.\n\nThe only caveat is Houbi made it very clear they are not responsible if something beyond their control happens to the mining farm, such as floods, fires, earthquakes, uprisings, even meteorites.\n\nBut aside from that, seems like a pretty sure bet.

The guaranteed return after 60 days for this particular investment is 0.024 bitcoins. At current prices that's 11.61 dollars. But in 60 days if the price of bitcoin goes back to 520 or higher, the interst would be 12.48 or higher, as the interest is paid in bitcoin, not in fiat.\n\nTo put it another way: if you were to invest 484 DOLLARS today in a bond that pays 2.4% in 60 days, you would get 11.61 dollars as interest in return no matter what (well, minus taxes). But if you invest 1 bitcoin over 60 days with a 2.4% return, your fiat profit will vary. If the price goes down, your return will be less than 11.61 USD. If the price goes up, your return will be more than 11.61 USD. And as we know, bitcoin has gone up many times over in the last 5 years.\n\nRisky? Sure. But then again, this is r/bitcoin, not r/fiat.": 1, "Wow let's hope it works out and do it again in the future": 1, 'Of course it matters.

But their APR is about a little under 6%, which is not that bad compared to a regular savings account in the US. But the APR for the Dig-VC shares is 1.2 per month, which is 14.4% per year.

My point still stands, they didn\'t want to do it but it is obvious to anyone with a modicum of software development knowledge that a spec should have been as high priority and that a clear testable spec is the way to move a project forward quickly with a little misunderstanding as possible. "The reference code is the spec" is lazy and amateurish, not what you want to build a world changing technology on. And it was not just what they said, but the way it was said.          \n           \nI am not sure why you are trying to retrospectively white-wash their stance. It was not the right thing for bitcoin at that time, so your theoretical comparisons to Linux are not accurate. The code base was reasonably small, the individual modules/functions were not complex, a spec was appropriate at that time and even before that. It was, as far as I can tell, an ego based decision - "we know best".     \n     \nEdit: I will add that I notice that the core devs also want it both ways. When there are problems/issues, etc they will argue - "well, bitcoin is an experiment so it might fail and that is ok because it is an experiment". Then when it suits them, they will argue "omg, we can\'t risk doing X because bitcoin is too valuable".': 3, "Well, it's a bit of a double-edged sword.

Look at the problem we had from the accidental hard fork, and that was theoretically the *same* software from the same makers which diversified things to confusion. So maybe that was the source of any push back you might have seen. \n\nIf people work in silos trying all sorts of crazy independent implementation experiments, and random swaths of people are running them all the same that could be problematic. Ideally we'll get a bit more structure and smart integration of various versions. I believe that's part of Gavin's new focus, working to head off problems and ensure smooth compatibility as Bitcoin and its software implementation expands.

There was a time with Linux when I'm sure Linus Torvalds wouldn't have dared accept much if any external code - he was still building out and testing things himself (at that time OSes were gigantic, complicated things only made by companies with teams of engineers).

Let's not forget that Bitcoin Core (bitcoind back in those days) has already forked against *itself* proving that a single implementation does not solve the issue.\n\nI agree getting to the point Gavin discusses will be challenging, but that's why it's important we embrace changes that are ultimately better for the overall Bitcoin ecosystem instead of actively discouraging them.": 4, 'I am familiar with the issues, what I am trying to point out is that this is 180 degrees from the core dev position a couple years ago - where they were openly hostile to 1) a spec, 2) a test suite and 3) alternative server implementations.      \n    \nOne quote was - the "reference" code _is_ the spec and (phrased with more words) any attempt to re-implement it will lead to disaster.

I wasn't suggesting he was some elitist control freak. I read some of his history, and he surprised himself at some of the things he was able to pull off (he underestimated his ability I believe).

Hardware Backdoor's are real and more prevalent than you can imagine. The only way to be sure you aren't susceptible is to design and build your own CPU and computer system. Fabricating your own silicon chips is a surprisingly simple process, as all you really need is some sand.\n\n*    Once you've hand manufactured your CPU, Motherboard, RAM, and IO devices, you'll need to write a C compiler that will compile down to your CPU's native language. Writing your own compiler will keep you safe from the Ken Thompson Hack.\n\n*    Create a simple OS that you can use to access the internet. Some people might suggest using Linux, but there are 9,868,933 lines of code in just the Kernel, most of which you won't need, and personally verifying every line for rootkits might take a bit longer than you have the patience for.\n\n*    Create your own bitcoin client. Satoshi's client could possess hidden back doors, or they could have been introduced since his departure. The classic create-a-currency-to-compromise-a-users-computer-attack is devastating, and we can't rule Satoshi out. Bottom line is that you cannot be sure.\n\n*    Dig a very deep hole into the earth, and surround it with at least three feet of re-enforced concrete. Place your custom PC in there. Thermal imaging attacks can easily penetrate the walls of your home, and reveal your private keys to any wayward onlooker, or high tech peeping tom. A sufficiently deep hole will also protect you against common keystroke sound vibration attacks. Also, if you've had any help so far, this hole will double as their grave. Loose ends are security holes.\n\n*    Before generating your public private key pair, carefully run your hands over your head to ensure that you don't have any suspicious electrodes attached to your skull. Mind Reading technology is real.\n\n*    Once your wallet is setup, Quantum Encrypt it so that any attempts to access it will immediately destroy the information.\n\n*    This is the most important: Never leave your re-enforced hole in the ground. Leaving your hole makes you susceptible to the highly effective (despite what Bill O'Reilly would have you believe) water-boarding-private-key-extraction-attack.\n\nSource: [A long time computer security expert](http://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1e4b9s/the_only_truly_secure_way_to_use_bitcoin_from_a/)\n": 1, 'Yeah, I remember using my GPU to create apple shares back in the 1980s?

Sure, we could start deleting certain posts and forwarding people to the daily thread, but like I said before, that's likely to just piss everyone off and even drive some people away.\n\nMaybe we can work up to it. Start with a monthly thread. If we manage to fill it every month, we could switch to a weekly thread. If those start overflowing, *then* we could revisit the daily thread. Or maybe just a standard non-sticky daily thread is the way to go. In the meantime, my challenge to everyone who'd like to see a regular daily thread is to consider ways that we can encourage more people to participate in them.
