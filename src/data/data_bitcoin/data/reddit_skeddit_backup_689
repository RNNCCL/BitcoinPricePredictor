They can be profitable without fees.': 4, "Don't forget, a big portion of CC fees are simply because it's expensive by design. What that means is that the fee itself for changing some bits of data in a ledger, that's cheap. What's expensive are things like fraud, which is possible because every creditcard payment requires you to hand over the SINGLE private master key to all your money, and then relies on lots of other probabilities to detect fraud (note the probability thing). This is where you see fraud rates like 10% of all Americans having dealt with CC fraud, 7% with ATM fraud etc. We're talking billions of dollars here, and someone is paying for them. Lowering revenue has nothing to do with the problem of lowering these costs, it's completely separate.\n\nSo this notion that costs disappear when revenue-caps are put in place are nonsense. The costs still exist, so they'll find other ways to pay for them. For example, a report earlier this month:\n\n> However, the report suggests a [fee] cap could result in higher costs for consumers, a reduction in access to credit cards for SMEs and a contraction in bank lending. Europe Economics said UK high street banks would lose \xc2\xa3784m a year in interchange fees, which they would \xe2\x80\x9crecover from consumers through new bank charges\xe2\x80\x9d.\n\nSounds like there's no need for a system that actually removes fees because it removes costs, like bitcoin, eh?\n\nBeyond that though, even if this was all awesome for creditcard companies and consumers, even years ago when just about no merchant accepted bitcoin, we all concluded that bitcoin would not be revolutionary because it'd improve on credit card payments. \n\nThe OP's question of 'does this affect bitcoin's business model' to me is like asking 'did the internet's business model fail because we still spent the last decade calling mostly over old phone lines rather than voip?'. It looks at this value-network that is bitcoin as a limited business to compete against creditcards for the fraction of the global population who use them, it's so much more than that.\n\nBut does it affect bitcoin's place in the payments space in Europe (a place where, let's not forget, there is a fetish for paying with debit, rather than credit like in the US)? Sure, it changes some things. \n\nBut let's not act like this is a godsend to consumers, you'd fail to mention this: the proposal also carries the notion that consumers become liable up to about $70 for theft. Meaning not only does the merchant still get screwed when someone pays with a stolen card (more frequent than you think) as he has to return the money and is out of his product (which ultimately the average consumer pays for anyway), but the individual consumer now also pays for the theft directly. Yet consumers are still forced, by design, to use an insecure system where one needs to hand over the key to their entire money vault anytime they buy so much as a lollipop with a CC. Again, this proposal doesn't solve systemic problems in the design of archaic creditcard technology. \n\nOf course this doesn't even mention the actual fees of owning a creditcard, or the cost of actual credit, and the various late payment charges. Nor does it mention the fixed fees merchants pay, i.e. their monthly subscription to process money, besides the cost per-swipe, or silly things like a setup-fee, cancellation fee, monthly minimum fee (all these apply to consumers and merchants). And I won't get into the politics of payment processing, like denying wikileaks donations. \n\nWe also must not forget that this doesn't apply to all cards, e.g. American Express is exempt (3-party systems instead of 4-party are exempt).\n\nAnd lastly, does this ruling really affect anything in the long-run? No. Of course not, it's illogical. The entire notion that CC companies would be threatened by bitcoin, and then forced to reduce fees, and then happily out-compete bitcoin ever after because of something they were forced to do, is illogical. If bitcoin really were to become a payments threat at some point, and the only thing the CC companies had to do was lower fees, they'd just do it themselves anyway. So a government forcing this is just doing something that would have been inevitable. i.e. if bitcoin can't compete against all the fees I mentioned, and can't compete on non-financial reasons (e.g. autonomy of your own money), and has no other raison d'etre outside of replacing CC payments, then it'd be dead within a few years anyway. This changes nothing.\n\nAs for whether it's actually happening? It still has to be endorsed by member states and by the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee, and then next year it must be voted on by the parliament. It's certainly not as 'official' as the title says. We'll see.\n\n\n": 3, 'One of the biggest pushes from the bitcoin community has been to try and get businesses to switch over to bitcoin due to the much lower fees it offers compared to credit/debit cards.

Widespread adoption of DPOS-like approaches to in-protocol governance that pay for continued development, allowing every coin to itself become its own 2.0\n2. Implicit extra-protocol DPOS is also a viable option. For example, it is established that the Ethereum social contract is that the quantity of ether should not exceed 60102216 * (1.198 + 0.26 * n) where n is the number of years past the genesis block. Once we go PoS, the intrinsic inflation will fall way below that. Hence, once/if ethereum.org goes bankrupt, anyone will be free to release their own "Ethereum 3.0" which allocates the difference to themselves, once again allowing individual cryptocurrencies to survive for a much longer term. Bitcoin is stuck with its fixed-supply dogma, which is good for digital gold, but unfortunately locks away this solution (as well as solution 1).\n3. This idea that I [mentioned in a recent blog post](https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/11/20/bitcoin-maximalism-currency-platform-network-effects/):\n\n> Another point to keep in mind is, what happens to the vol-coins themselves? Technological innovation is rapid, and if each network gets unseated within a few years, then the vol-coins may well never see substantial market cap. One answer is to solve the problem by using a clever combination of Satoshian thinking and good old-fashioned recursive punishment systems from the offline world: establish a social norm that every new coin should pre-allocate 50-75% of its units to the holders of some reasonable subset of the coins that came before it that directly inspired its creation, and enforce the norm blockchain-style \xe2\x80\x93 if your coin does not honor its ancestors, then its descendants will refuse to honor it, instead sharing the extra revenues between the originally cheated ancestors and themselves, and no one will fault them for that. This would allow vol-coins to maintain continuity over the generations. Bitcoin itself can be included among the list of ancestors for any new coin. Perhaps an industry-wide agreement of this sort is what is needed to promote the kind of cooperative and friendly evolutionary competition that is required for a multichain cryptoeconomy to be truly successful.': 2, "I heard he's like a genius or something.": 1, 'Even if all you care about is _Bitcoin_  specifically (as opposed to general cryptoeconomic R&D, which is my focus), then here you go:\n\nhttp://github.com/vbuterin/pybitcointools': 2, 'Vitalik Pumperik.': 2, "I don't know why this guy gets so much credit.

If people lose faith in the value store of Bitcoin, any crypto is less likely to achive mainstream adoption and any new functionality you provide has less chance to pervade society.

Following the price rises of 2013, 2014 was a year where investment money flowed into the ecosystem and bitcoin services started becoming more consumer friendly; laying the foundation for mainstream adoption.\n\nAt CAVIRTEX, 2014 was a year of growth and relationship building and we look forward to accelerating this trend in the new year. This year the Senate of Canada\xe2\x80\x99s Banking, Trade, and Commerce committee (BTC Committee ;) ) commenced an 18-month in-depth, public, study into digital currencies. Over half way through the study and after having heard experts from a plethora of disciplines, we are confident that the Senate will be making recommendations that further promote innovation within this space in Canada.  CAVIRTEX was honoured to present to the committee in April and help them understand our business and the challenges we face.\n\nIn April the Bitcoin Alliance of Canada held the Bitcoin Expo in Toronto and this marked the largest Bitcoin gathering in Canada\xe2\x80\x99s history. The excitement, knowledge exchange, and innovation on display at the Expo was incredible.  CAVIRTEX was pleased to be a gold sponsor and we look forward to participating in future events.\n\nFollowing the Bitcoin Expo, we bought 10 BitAccess Bitcoin ATM\xe2\x80\x99s as a means of further expanding Bitcoin accessibility in Canada. On August 13th, we officially launched 7 BTM\xe2\x80\x99s in Toronto making it the Bitcoin ATM capital of the world. According to our PR firm, Jesson + Company, the launch received over 72 million impressions across media sources and was trending on the front page of Google News Canada.\n\nIn October, the entire CAVIRTEX team converged on Toronto to bring the message of Bitcoin to the world money show. In the days leading up to the show CAVIRTEX was featured on BNN, Sun TV, the Globe and Mail, the National Post, and many other new outlets discussing Bitcoin and inviting the public to come visit us at the Money Show. During the show we encouraged members of the Bitcoin community to come down and join us in evangelizing Bitcoin as the future of money.  The passion and enthusiasm of our team and the community helped not only create awareness, but understanding of Bitcoin, the technology, and its potential to transform the future.\n\n2014 was a year that saw many major global brands begin accepting and integrating Bitcoin into their products and services. Dell, Overstock, Expedia, NewEgg, TigerDirect, Wikipedia, Shopify, Time Inc, PayPal, Microsoft, and many others have joined the movement. We feel this is only the beginning and we are anticipating the growth to keep up through 2015.\n\nThis fall, the Bitcoin community embraced social tipping as a way of generating bitcoin awareness, saying thank you, and donating to causes that are near and dear. Thanks to the services like ChangeTip, Bitcoin is becoming increasingly consumer friendly and usable.\n\nWe firmly believe that Bitcoin is going to flourish thanks to the collaboration of a global, decentralized, network of individuals, organizations, and communities. This Holiday season we would like to give praise and say thank you to this wonderful community for their hard work and dedication. We are truly energized by your passion and enthusiasm and are looking forward to the years to come.\n\nMerry Christmas, Happy Holidays, and Happy New Year from all of us at CAVIRTEX.": 1}, ('Hollywood is trying to break DNS - Time for decentralized Namecoin .BIT domains !', 74): {'thats cool, it is better than how it used to be\n\nused to be some convoluted song and dance that also required a lot of troubleshooting\n\nnow it is just a chrome extension': 2, "I don't really understand what you mean.

As I said, bitcoin only stops people from stealing trough money creation, it doesn't stop people for doing bad things with their money and money itself is not a solution for that. Money is just a tool which you can do both: good and bad things. Just like you can with a hammer, a knife of a gun. This is a human problem and you won't find a solution through the tool they use.

This has never been the case (expect of a brief moment of the USA history under the president Washington).\n\nFirst, having a fixed number to represent wealth stops the power that be to steal the people.

': 3, 'I think I definitely fit in the category of people that you want to hear from. \n\nShort story: I thought bitcoin was interesting, bought some to play with, then discovered that bitcoin is a an idea without a promising future. Now I frequent /r/Buttcoin and laugh at how disillusioned a lot of people here are.\n\nLong story: I first heard of bitcoin in either 2011 or 2012, but it was nothing more than a few passing references on reddit. I do remember hearing the story about the guy ordering pizza with bitcoin and thinking it was kind of funny.\n\nI starting reading more about it sometime in the middle of 2013. I\'ve always been really interested in macroeconomics as well as monetary policy, so I thought it was cool that there was a sort of real world experiment like bitcoin. While I did (and still do) have a lot of problems with the economic and ideological philosophy behind bitcoin, it still offered a lot of interesting case examples of radical policy in play. \n\nI kind of abandoned following bitcoin until late 2013 and early 2014. With the big bubble, media attention exploded and a lot of people were talking about it. My employer at the time was toying with the idea of accepting it (someone in our industry had just started accepting it, and it got some news), and my department spent a good deal of time talking about it. It never got serious, but it was a regular point of conversation. Eventually we decided that accepting it would be a pain in the ass and it wasn\'t worth the trouble.  \n\nNot too long after that, I ended up at a different job. I had more disposable income and big chunks of free time, so I decided to take part in the bitcoin experience. I did a little bit of playing around (making wallets, transferring it, figuring out different ways to store it). I didn\'t find anything I wanted to buy with it, so I decided to trade a bit. While I had never actively traded before, I have taken finance classes that touch on technical analysis. While it wasn\'t perfect, I had a few well timed trades and made a modest profit.\n\nAs I spent more time with bitcoin, the more I had to interact with the weirdos. I was happy to trade on the dips as much as the rises, but there was some strong negativity towards me anytime I predicted downwards movement or said I didn\'t think it would be a long term success. That negativity, coupled with the growing political radicalism of bitcoin users really turned me away from the currency.\n\nI genuinely believed that bitcoin had some cool potential in the remittance market, but because I didn\'t think it was going to revolutionize the world I was down voted and driven away. Even if bitcoin was god\'s gift to man, there\'s no way it\'s going to reach mass adoption if this community is the one acting as its spokesperson. This is such a toxic environment and it\'s become increasingly dillusional.\n\nWhile my opinion on bitcoin hasn\'t changed (I think it\'s a fun proof of concept with the potential for niche applications, but it is fundamentally flawed as a major currency), my opinion on the future of bitcoin has drastically changed.\n\nQuite honestly, my "aha" moment was when someone came to either this subreddit or bitcoinmarkets saying how he had lost a lot of money on bitcoin and he kind of wanted out. While not everyone was saying it, a lot of people were going on there telling him to hold on and were telling him that bitcoin had surely hit bottom. They were saying that he was better off staying invested and riding it out.\n\nThat thread (I\'ll try and find it tomorrow when I\'m on my laptop) pissed me off beyond belief. These people were convincing someone who clearly wanted more financial security to stick with an investment that was failing and showed no real signs of stopping. He was an a vulnerable state, and a lot of people told him to choose a move that (whether they admit it or not) helps protect their investment. \n\nSince then, it\'s hard not to see a lot of people involved with bitcoin as predators, whether they mean to be or not. With this group leading the way, it\'s hard to be optimistic about the future of bitcoin.\n': 10, 'You should. ': 3, "> Frankly, I thought the state would have stopped it a long time ago.\n\nYou and me both.  I feel like the longer you've been following bitcoin, the more optimistic about it you are.  If you would have predicted where we are now back in 2010/2011, you would have been considered a crazy optimist - back then it was a pretty common opinion to just assume the state would ban the ever-living shit out of it if it ever gained much traction, and the debate was more about whether or not bitcoin would be able to overcome those obstacles.  So now that we're here, it's strange to see that people are considering this a failure of any sort, but I can understand how it could seem that way if you've only been following it for the past year or so.  At least from my perspective, a correction of 60-70% or so in 2014 is more than reasonable after a historic bullrun in 2013 of ~6000%.  That's like 5 steps forward, 1 step back at least as far as price is concerned.  And the industry in general has been coming along very nicely in terms of development of various services and features, and healthy venture capital injections means that trend isn't stopping anytime soon.  \n\nIt's also worth pointing out that [all this has happened before, and all this will happen again](http://www.wired.com/2011/11/mf_bitcoin/all/).": 10, '[deleted]': 2, 'Well, not just the black market, system D as well unless it is banned by every country.': 5, "Don't invest what you can't afford to lose?": 9, ">So basically you don't like a technology because of your perception of the users of that technology? Would you not buy an iphone because of some crazy apple fanboys?\n\nWay to strawman my argument. This is exactly the kind of crap that makes me really dislike most of the bitcoin community. \n\nI don't like the technology for a lot of reasons. There are some serious fundamental flaws that prohibit it from being a serious currency. I do like it as a proof of concept for certain types of remittance (Ripple seems to be filling the niche I saw for bitcoin), but that's the upper limit for the technology in my mind. \n\nI don't think the technology is going to be successful because of the community. Bitcoin has developed an identity and a culture. That identity will be the basis on which potential users will determine if they want to get involved or not. I hate to break it to you, but outside this bubble the mainstream perception of bitcoin is that it is used by scammers, drug dealers and political radicals. The constant pumping and political hyperbole that makes it to places like the front page of /r/ ) bitcoin really enforce the scammer/political radical stereotype.\n\n\n>You have a fundamental misunderstanding of how it works. r/bitcoin isn't bitcoin\n\nSo?

I\'ve had people try and sell me on MLM businesses.  While I\'m not saying bitcoin is a pyramid scheme or a ponzi scheme, a lot of the same cultural elements present in those sales environment exist in the bitcoin community. \n\nI think I would love the bitcoin community if it focused on the tech, or the experimental nature of bitcoin. Instead, it seems that every conversation leads to points about how and why people should keep putting more money into bitcoin.  \n\n> So, there are a few dozen Bitcoin pumpers in the forums that spoil the experience for the thousands who attend.

Nearly everyone over there is extremely bullish on bitcoin, to the point that they\'re delusional. \n\nI frequent /r/buttcoin and am very outspoken about my opinions on bitcoin because I feel there needs to be a balance to the one-sided nature of the bitcoin community.  Anytime I see people try to lure new users with dishonest representations of bitcoin, I feel I need to jump in and provide a counter.  \n\nI also use /r/buttcoin as a place to vent about my feelings using jokes, without muddling up the conversation in the threads we mock.  When I actually post to /r/bitcoin or /r/bitcoinmarkets I try to stay on topic and keep things relatively serious. /r/buttcoin is an outlet to crack jokes without derailing conversation.  \n\n__________\n\nOn a side note, I think it\'s absolutely ridiculous (and telling) that the bitcoin community gets so worked up about /r/buttcoin.  I\'ve had people accuse me of being a paid shill, and I\'m pretty sure they were serious about it.

I\'ve definitely been seeing this community evolve over the past year and a half. (Combined with more and more exaggeration from r/buttcoin). Because as discussion trends grow and the community stays the same size, people have introspection and "grow up" on certain things. The hive mind evolves its intelligence slowly but surely.\n\nThere has been progressively less examples of people giving horrible financial advice and horrible security advice.

I don't measure the success or failure of bitcoin based on daily market price.\n\nI measure the success on the mere fact that the network continues to function and has remained largely unmolested by the state.\n\nEvery single day they aren't throwing people in jail for using bitcoin is a win.\n\nFrankly, I thought the state would have stopped it a long time ago.": 23, "You have to understand that for bitcoin to be successful, it has to have value and continue to be used.  Both of those factors rely on a network of users.  Sure, it can technically exist as long as two nodes are operating and a couple of guys are mining on their gaming computers, but it's hard to call that anything other than a failure for bitcoin.  \n\nOne analogy that I think is fitting is comparing bitcoin to Facebook vs. Google+.\n\nIt's fair to say that in order for a social network to succeed, it needs a critical mass of users.  Though it can technically exist with few users, it can't function the way it was truly designed unless a lot of people use that service.  \n\nFacebook established itself as the de facto social network.  While there were networks that came before it, it was the first to actually become socially ubiquitous on a wide scale.  A lot of users had a lot of problems with it, but it still exists simply because it's so entrenched within internet culture. \n\nGoogle + came around, and it offered a lot of advantages and services not provided by Facebook.  People that used it tended to like it, but one thing was missing... the critical mass of users.  \n\nGoogle + toiled around for a while and found a niche audience, but it never reached it's true potential because there simply weren't enough users that frequented it.  Features that would have been great went unused or underused.  Eventually it kind of fizzled away and now there's speculation that it will close down.  \n\nEven if it stays operational, it's socially irrelevant and by most metrics it has failed.  \n\nBitcoin is in the same boat. Without a critical mass of users, it can deliver on the following things:\n\n- It can't be a reliable store of value.  With low users, volume will be low and price will be subject to volatility.  \n\n- It won't be a practical currency.  If user adoption stalls and price remains volitile, it will be difficult to convince anyone (especially businesses) to keep bitcoin on their books.  Without bitcoin cycling completely through an economy, it's hard to call bitcoin a currency.  \n\n- It won't be a source for innovation.  If consumer adoption doesn't occur, the pace of outside development will stall or drop.  \n\nBitcoin needs users to be successful, and it's not really possible to argue against that.
