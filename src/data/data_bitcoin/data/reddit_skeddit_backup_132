Supporting SegWit is a non trivial task as it's a whole new type of transaction.  \n\nIn contrast, the Classic increase is a simple block size increase.

As someone put it, if you have a bus with 20 seats and 25 people who want a ride, there's no ticket price that gets everybody on the bus.  \n\nFirst- that means the effective death of 0-conf.  If there are more transactions than there is space, we have to start throwing away some of those transactions to keep the mempool from inflating uncontrollably.  Core's proposal is to throw away the lowest fee transactions, which means any merchants (BitPay etc) will have to start running probability estimates to decide if a transaction will make it into a block or not, and perhaps using CPFP to keep from losing money.  Suddenly Bitcoin at point of sale becomes a lot more expensive and risky.  \n\nLet's say a few of the big guys (Coinbase, Circle, BitPay, etc) decide to skip SegWit.  That means whatever portion of the block their transactions take up (and I suspect it's a major portion) won't benefit from SegWit, *and neither will anybody else*.  Because if 75% of transactions don't support SegWit, that means a very modest benefit for everybody else.  Probably not enough to stay ahead of the transaction load.  So that puts us back where we were before- throwing away transactions, making 0-conf useless.  \n\n": 1, "I don't see how the bus analogy fits? With one strategy you have a bus with 40 seats that fits 40 fatties, with another strategy you have a bus with 20 seats that fits 20 fatties or 40 skinnies, or some mix of both. In both you can get the same 40 people on the bus - although one is harder because you gotta get all of the fatties to lose weight and become skinnies.\n\nBasically your argument then is that it's too hard to get fatties to lose weight. My take is that if we get into a jam like totally full blocks and much higher fees, we have a big built in motivator to get the fatties to lose weight so they'll go for it, SegWit shouldn't be that hard to implement and deploy across the board since there will be sample code and from a transaction broadcast point of view it's just a reformatting of what we have already.\n": 3, "Gavin now admits it was a mistake\n\nIt's weird though that Core gets no credit for identifying the plan as unrealistic.

This would not surprise me.  \n\nAnd if everybody that used Bitcoin ran Bitcoin-core and upgraded to the latest version as soon as it was released, that would be a simple drop in upgrade.  But that is not the case.\n\nIn reality, there are many, many different wallet systems and payment systems involved in the Bitcoin ecosystem.  Not all of them run Bitcoin-Core, and many of the ones that do use additional software that won't yet understand SegWit transactions.  The ones that don't run Core are usually running something they built themselves.  \n\nThat means that once SegWit is released, at that point all those hundreds of other independent systems will BEGIN their own process of evaluating SegWit and integrating it into their own systems.  Many of the smaller ones might just ignore SegWit- the cost of implementing SegWit might be greater than the transaction fees they'd save with smaller transactions.  The larger ones have a dev/qa/release cycle which may be many weeks or months long.  \n\nMy point is- when SegWit is 'ready to use' means absolutely nothing, because the benefit doesn't start to happen until most people *are already using it*.  \n\nSo if you want to bet that SegWit will be mainstream adopted before Classic has release worthy code, I'll absolutely take that bet (although you'd be a fool to make such a bet).  \n\nIf you want to bet that SegWit will be mainstream adopted before Classic's 2MB upgrade is voted in and accepted, that might be a slightly more balanced bet.

SegWit would give people a choice there. \n\nAnd that\'s wonderful!  My problem comes when the only reason people need cheaper transactions is because the blocks are full and the only way to make a transaction confirm is to pay a huge fee.  Sure SegWit gives them the \'choice\' to pay less, but if the blocks are full it\'s not really much of a choice.  It\'s like "If you do things this way, you only get fucked over half as bad".

If you yourself admit that SegWit will have very slow uptake, that also means it will have a very slow effect on the block size issue.

Thus, within 2-3 seconds, a tx is almost fully propagated, thus making it virtually impossible to still broadcast a 2nd (double spending) tx and getting it propagated successfully. \n\nMerchant accepting 0-conf can quite easily increase their odds: as soon as they see an incoming tx, keep probing at other nodes in the network if they have the same tx in their mempool for like 2-3 seconds (I think there are also APIs providing similar functionality). If that's the case, a potential fraudster will have a very low probability of still getting their doublespend tx relayed.\n\nThe merchant's software could even further increase their defense by automatically relaying an incoming tx directly to all miner IPs they know. \n\nI know you know more about Bitcoin than I do.

Proof of work seemed like a good way to achieve that. The real power in the bitcoin world is helt by the miners, as long as the mining process is properly decentralized bitcoin will be decentralized. But real world competition caused many cracks to appear in this model, the first flaws that appeared were pooled mining (centralizing power with mining operators), then came ASICs (Centralizing power with mining operators with good industry connections), then came cheap electricity + latency issues (Centralizing power with mining pools with access to cheap electicity and low latency to others big mining pools). These pressures has essentially caused mining to be centalized mainly in China because there they have cheap electricity, good industry for creating ASICs and low latency to other chinese mining pools (and high latency to the rest of the world).\nOne important thing to keep in mind is that bitcoin itself can evade capital controls and move seamlessly accross borders. But mining equipment cannot. It would be easy to confiscate all mining equipment in the country and use it to destroy bitcoin.\nSo what is the solution to this problem? Proof of stake is the solution because it removed the physical element and allows network voting power to move seamlessly accross borders too. Traditional Proof of Stake contains some flaws like the Nothing at Stake problem. But the new algorithm designed for proof of stake in Ethereum solved all these issues.\nThe bitcoin developer community has proven that it is unable to make even small changed to the consesus algorithm. So completely switching to a different model is never going to happen.\nIf you are willing to open your mind and learn about how Ethereum will beat bitcoin by being far superior to bitcoin watch the videos of Devcon1\nBitcoin is doomed and Ethereum will replace it.\nObviously most people involved in Ethereum are aware of this. But for most other people it is not so obvious. But it is hard to convince the masses because they are not reading enough information about Ethereum, either because of censorship in subs or because of denial.\nTherefore I think it is the mission of each of us to get the word out. Only by saying it often and giving clear examples we can teach the masses what we already know. Try to reach at least on uninformed person every day. (If you lack ideas, just post the link to this post in different reddit subs with target audience).\nFirst of all it is important to remind people that Bitcoin was also once small, and that people also did not believe in Bitcoin because they couldn\'t imagine what benefit it would give over conventional payment systems. That perception changed dramatically for bitcoin and the same will happen to Ethereum. It is important to emphasise this because people often use the psychological principle of Social Proof to make decisions in unknown situations, this is currently working against Ethereum, the underlying reasoning is, "If Ethereum is so great why is it so cheap?", "If Ethereum is so great why is everyone talking about Bitcoin?", "If Ethereum is so great, why are the smart people X, Y and Z not invested in it?".\nSecond of all it is important to emphasise that not only is Ethereum a crypto that offers a whole new concept of the decentralized web, it is also better than Bitcoin at being a currency for payments. This is easy to show by explaining a real world scenario. Imagine the perfect crypto currency, obviously it should be possible to re-implement the most convenient payment systems used today using that crypto currency, and doing so in a decentralized way, with no added fees or middle man. It should be able to behave very much like cash in being able to spend it quick and easy. The most similar electronic product that offers this is the anonymous tap to pay, prepaid payment card. It is easy, it is anonymous, it wont be hacked like phones, it has the ability to limit exposure to compromise by having limited balance that automatically recharged and the end of the day. Implementing this in Bitcoin would not be possible because the small chip in the card is not connected to the internet, and sharing your private key is a security hazard. But what if your wallet/contract could use asymmetric encryption to accept a different secret payment key on every payment. This way it is possible to implement the payment with a touch to pay card in a secure way. In Ethereum it is also possible to program a contract to recharge a wallet at the end of every day for added security, It is also possible to automatically exchange Ethereum for a token that is backed by a stable currency for those merchants that are worried about exchange fluctuations.\nThird of all it is important to note that Bitcoin is never going to be implementing these changes. Look how hard it is for them to implement a blocksize increase. Changing the scripting language to Turing complete would be a far more controversial change. One that the miners will probably never agree to this. And also keep in mind that quick payments need either zero-confirmation transactions or fast blocktime.\nSo if Ethereum has the potential to implement the most convenient payment system imaginable but Bitcoin cannot then one can only conclude that Ethereum will win in the long run. Bitcoin will die like Myspace, and Ethereum will become the golden standard.': 3, "I got a message as well, it's not Ethereum Foundation that's doing this and we don't know who - but it's certainly not reflective of the community or the moderators": 1}, ('Introducing...

Meanwhile, SegWit is still in development and early testing, and is not as well understood (leaving more questions than answers). 2MB is ready to deploy in days, while SegWit is expected to take months.\n\nAgain, I find this entire subreddit to be unhealthy.

It is only the reference implementation that everyone voluntarily runs. It was also always said to arguments like "bitcoin will be the myspace of cryptocurrency", that it is opensource, if altcoin xyz implements a killer feature, we can just add this if many people agree - so it has to be able to adapt somehow. I think at this point the best would be for the core-devs to wake up, to what the miners, merchants and users want and maybe just merge the bitcoin-classic patch when it is ready.\n\nI see that from a pure technical pov the blocksize needs to be small, so blocks propagate fast and people can run this on a raspberry, but from an economic pov it needs to be as big as possible. \n\nMaybe this all totally wrong, I read walls of text here everyday and try to reevaluate but I am still leaning towards raising it up, so we can be sure there is enough space until all the other improvements are ready.\n': 1, '"If you want decentralization, rally behind this one centralized implementation."': 0, '> it\'s the push back from existing money powers who\'ve infiltrated the debate.
