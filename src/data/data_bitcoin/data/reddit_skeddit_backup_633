Just know this right away and focus on what you enjoy doing.\n\n- Know that it\'s easy to let one negative comment deflate the good feelings of 10 or even 100 compliments. Try really hard not to let that happen.\n\n- Know that most people who like software they\'re using don\'t bother to offer compliments, they just happily keep on using it and never say "thanks" - so if it seems you\'re receiving mostly negative feedback, that\'s because complainers are more likely to talk to you than anyone else!  That doesn\'t mean your app is awesome or that it doesn\'t suck - it just means you should trust your instinct. If you\'re happy with it, keep on keepin\' on!\n\n- Your response about why you created this app is perfect. You saw a problem with other apps that you didn\'t like, and you sought to solve it.  KEEP DOING THAT!  Find problems. Solve them. I don\'t care how much cleaner and more elegant your code is than the next guy if you\'re not *solving real problems*.  I\'ll take a fly-by-night kind-of-sloppy developer whose code works and solves problems over a meticulous "clean" developer who\'s so focused on code cleanliness that he or she isn\'t actually solving real problems.\n\nLast piece of advice, and this is going to rub some people the wrong way: Remember that no matter how much you like programming, especially in your teen years and early twenties, it\'s *really* important that you get out of the house and hang out with friends, meet new people, develop great communications skills, etc.  \n\nThe stereotype that lots of programmers are socially awkward nerds who are often elitist and not very nice to other people exists for a reason -- and those people are less desirable to hire because unless you go into business for yourself right out of college, you\'re going to need to work with a *team* someday. You\'ll need peoples\' help, and they\'ll need yours.  Being a good communicator and a generally nice / interesting person to hang out with -- even to people who aren\'t programmers -- is something you\'re still young enough to get awesome at!  Find interests outside of programming (music? sports? art?) that get you out of the house and into the real world.\n\nBONUS: Getting into spaces outside of programming will make you see problems that programming can help solve in those spaces, giving you more fun / exciting projects to tackle! :-)\n\nKeep on doing what you\'re doing - it\'s so kick ass that you guys are making / releasing apps at your age.

I think the pros outweigh the cons on this.\n\nI agree with your review of the decentralized nature of bitcoin, and why it is necessarily the case given the construction of it programmatically.  I also think it\'s quite magical.  But a part of me wonders whether or not you\'re explaining away the wild fluctuations in value as demand shocks in a manner that you would criticize if it were about the Yen.  Perhaps you can expound upon your thoughts on why (or how) the market is incentivized to absorb these shocks, and how you believe the size of the market will reduce the size of the shocks.\n\nQuick side note: I\'m personally a small value bitcoin owner and am willing to bet that there are ~10% odds that it will see 20x growth.  In particular, I think it will become appealing to nations with hyperinflation as a more stable form of transactional currency (after the speculation bubble fully bursts).

Unfortunately the side effect is demand/supply shocks to the market cause volatility and so it is up to the market to react to/absorb these shocks as best it can until it gets large enough that large shocks become progressively more difficult over time because the coins become far more distributed and the market becomes far larger and can react faster to absorb any shocks of supply/demand that the Bitcoin market experiences.\n\nEdit: typos.': 1, "> base metal as scarce as gold\n\nBeing a base metal gives it all the decentralized properties I listed.\n\nBeing government-issued fiat money doesn't.": 3, 'So you don\'t magically "transport" dollars over communications channels to like buy stuff off amazon? you drive dollar bills to amazon?': 1}, ("He's no longer speaking though...", 12): {'Glad im not going to the paybase conference': 2, 'Welcome to the Bitcoin PayBase Conference.\n\nImpeccable organization.

Sidechains don't solve the value noise problem, and as you know if you are exploring other solutions, if your value is not stable, the outcome predictions are highly time sensitive, more easily manipulatable, and generally noisy themselves.  Schellingdollar stabilization techniques do not actually resolve the decay to zero (and it's not clear from the econometric models that they solve volatility either yet), and Pebble and wrappers like CFDs provide actually do not change the valuation process at all.\n\nThe problem, which has been well known for several years now, but which many in the Bitcoin community are still resistant to hearing, is that these POW (and other proof-mined) cryptocurrencies have no valuation process outside speculation.  And it is well known what this means: there will be several bubbles and then as people grow wise to the predatory nature of valuation, value will decrease to zero.  This is exactly what has been seen in every such cryptocurrency.  All the journal analyses show these are the econometric forces at play.  Every theoretical study has shown it.\n\nCryptocurrencies on proof cannot stably hold value.\n\nI think commodity-backed cryptocoins are really the only known path to stability so far.  Those are not mined by algorithm, they are mined by legal (digital) contracts and have intrinsic value in the legal backing.  Trading volatility in speculative markets so far has been shown to either have no effect (predictive markets, for instance, trend with speculation for obvious reasons) or they accelerate the limiting to equilibrium, which is unfortunately 0.

Now compare that to properly designed Bitcoin remittances.\n\nThat's funny because I invoice people in the US constantly from the SEPA region, the numbers you posted are way higher than what even a regular commercial bank charges effectively.  But you could also use a service like transferwise which gives you much better rates or you can talk to your bank.  For instance if you wire USD a lot you can usually negotiate better rates or get a USD account.
