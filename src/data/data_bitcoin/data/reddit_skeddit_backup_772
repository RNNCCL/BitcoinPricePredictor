Each sidechain can be created without a fork. I guess it could take years but I'm certain it will happen and will provide a quick easy way to anonymize your bitcoins without losing any with exchange rates by converting back and forth between different alt coins. ": 2, "I don't contend I'm an expert, and I'm willing to be persuaded that I'm mistaken. I may read more about it in the future, but nothing about the system seems to compel me towards that at this point.  \n\nDarkcoin may represent a useful compromise in decentralization, but I believe its core principles may be different from those of Bitcoin.": 1, "That looks great, but to me there's a simple and very basic problem. Darkcoin InstantX uses masternodes. These are a subset of nodes different from common nodes. This is clearly a step away from the truer decentralization achieved in Bitcoin.  \n\nMy understanding is, once you move away from decentralization, there are *many* possible ways to implement instant transactions. But at the same time, you lose the advantages of a more decentralized system. To me, Bitcoin functions as a layer that is close to optimally decentralized. If services that require some level of centralization are needed, they can and should be built on top of that.  \n\nI'm not sure if InstantX is something that is tied into Darkcoin protocols at a low level, but if it is, it would take a *lot* to convince me that is an acceptable compromise.  \n\nOn the other hand, if InstantX is something that rides *on top* of Darkcoin, I don't see why it can't be added on top of any other crypto-currency that evolved from Bitcoin, including of course, the original.": 2, 'Most alt coins have fake features to pump the price': 3, 'bitcoin cannot absorb it because it is based on masternode technology ;) \n\n': 1, "dude, the fact that majority of Bitcoin's hash power comes from 1-2 industrial mining pools makes me doubt that bitcoin is truly decentralized. \n\nhttps://blockchain.info/pools": 1, "I would first of all distinguish between mining centralization and centralization of the overall crypto-currency architecture. However, regarding mining centralization, it is something to keep an eye on, but I also see something very different in the chart you linked. I see it showing some 16+ charted segments, each representing *at least* one separate pool. Of these, one of the largest, comprising nearly 25%, is listed as unknown which actually consists of some 40-50 *other* miners or mining pools. As a whole, seems like a pretty fair distribution that is much more decentralized than not.  \n\nIf anyone would come up with a better method of distributing mining or decentralizing the transaction verification and block chain building process, I'd be all for it. However, I'm not all that concerned with the existing system for a number of reasons, chiefly:  \n\n1) The largest entities in the chart are all *mining pools* whose total hashing power actually consists of the assembled power of the pool members. In the unlikely event that large pools collude as bad actors, they would be unable to sustain the attack for very long. Once a whiff of impropriety reveals itself, pool members would defect from bad acting pools *en masse*.  \n\n2) All the incentives in the mining system drive against trying to attack the network. Why would you kill the goose laying your golden eggs? You would also further risk criminal and civil legal liabilities and possible restriction or loss of personal freedom for a large part of your life to come?  \n\n3) Even in the extraordinarily unlikely event of an *irrational* and miraculously sustained hash rate attack, the system can only be slowed or stopped, with possible small scale double-spend attempts that could just be rolled-back if a hard fork is the implemented response.  \n\nFinally, Darkcoin's X11 hashing system, though designed to slow ASIC development, has nothing in it that inherently prevents the development of similar mining centralization should it ever achieve similar network effect as that of Bitcoin. X11 farms and massive pools can just as easily be built, just with different ASICs or customized CPUs/GPUs. With enough financial motivation, ASICs could be created for each of the round robin protocols and switched as necessary.  \n\nAnd as I mentioned initially, the comparison I'm making is in the architecture of the overall network itself, not just the mining aspect of it. If Darkcoin is tied to InstantX at a low network protocol level, it is demonstrably more centralized than Bitcoin due to the inclusion of masternodes. If InstantX runs on top of Darkcoin, almost any crypto can implement it or something similar in basically a modular way.": 2, 'Any major change bitcoin tries to implement will require a fork and we all know how risky it is.

Amir Taaki and a team of other developers created the first prototype in April 2014 at a Toronto Bitcoin Hackathon. DarkMarket was developed as a proof of concept in response to the seizure of the online marketplace Silk Road in October 2013. Taaki compared DarkMarket\xe2\x80\x99s improvements on Silk Road to BitTorrent\xe2\x80\x99s improvements on Napster. Indeed BitTorrent, the father of modern approaches to a decentralized Internet, proved to be a fast and fully operational replacement for Napster without the critical weakness of depending on a central server.\n\nSoon after DarkMarket was revealed at the Hackathon, developer Brian Hoffman forked the project and renamed it \xe2\x80\x9cOpenBazaar.\xe2\x80\x9d The project is not specifically meant as a platform for illegal markets \xe2\x80\x93 rather, it\xe2\x80\x99s intended for distributed general-purpose marketplaces like eBay \xe2\x80\x93 but when it\xe2\x80\x99s operational it seems likely that it will be used for illegal operations as well, which the decentralized nature of the platform will make very hard to shut down.': 7, 'Each "illegal" vendor will likely have many different strategies.

To prevent "penny-flooding" denial-of-service attacks on the network, the reference implementation caps the number of free transactions it will relay to other nodes to (by default) 15 thousand bytes per minute.\n\nAlso, besides the potential never to be forwarded to a miner, I believe nodes "forget" unconfirmed transactions after a certain amount of time\xe2\x80\x94certainly due to being restarted.': 2, "Making cash/bank deposits and withdrawals is really painful and awkward, and usually involves expense.
