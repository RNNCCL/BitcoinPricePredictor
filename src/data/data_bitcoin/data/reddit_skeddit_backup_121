Up until recently individual members ($99 a year) could also elect two board members, allowing for community perspectives to be represented at the board level."  But now, the individual members cannot be selected.  This is similar in some ways to what appears to be happening at the Bitcoin Foundation, where (although the bylaws for elections haven\'t yet been changed), appointments were made for open board seats and elections were deferred to a date uncertain.  \n\nIn general, it appears as though individual or association\'s representation (for those who are not representatives of a financially powerful organization) can no longer have a seat at the table at the Linux Foundation.  This does not bode well for open source development, and on a tangential note, might not bode well for bitcoin in some respects as Linux-based releases are considered more secure than Windows or MacOSX.

In the mean time these companies will provide some great open source developments which will only benefit the Linux ecosystem. Once the aforementioned "change of direction" occurs the people who were drawn to Linux because it wasn\'t controlled by corporate interests and government agencies will fork the code and create a new community. True, many users will stick with the MS/IBM/Whatever version but that\'s no different than today. You can\'t force people to care about security.\n\nThat\'s the beauty of Open Source.
