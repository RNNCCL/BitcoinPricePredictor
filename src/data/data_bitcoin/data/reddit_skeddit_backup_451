The consensus among computer scientists at the time was that he was a super genius engineer and programmer.  He was the Michael Jordan of programming, and even when Microsoft was a billion dollar company, he was still tightly involved with the software.  Even when Microsoft was a $100 billion dollar company, Gates was spending about 70% of his time on engineering and coding (unheard for a big company).  Of course at that point he wasn't coding himself; he would meet with teams of engineers and criticize their code.  Part of why he was able to grow Microsoft so quickly was that all the top programmers in the world wanted to work with him.  Your perspective on Microsoft and Gates probably comes from the very end of his tenure.  It's easy to forget that a good chunk of modern computing was literally invented by Gates.  If you talk to one of the engineers who worked at Microsoft in its first decade, they'll explain how they genuinely felt they were changing the world.

However, it is Wednesday, the doctor\'s day off and because she has a golf date, she does not respond. The woman\'s condition worsens and because no other physician can be procured in time, she dies. Her estate then sues the doctor for not coming to her aid.

Arnie is a somewhat conservative, considerably egocentric individual. He believes that doctors are human beings, who like anyone else, are entitled to a day off, and that it would be unfair to require them to be at the beck and call of their patients. For this reason, his initial impression of the solution to the hypothetical is that the doctor should not be liable. Through his research, he discovers the case of *Hurley v. Eddingfield*, which establishes the rule that in the absence of an explicit contract, i.e., when there has been no actual meeting of the minds, there can be no liability. In the hypothetical, there was clearly no meeting of the minds. Therefore, Arnie concludes that his initial impression was correct and that the doctor is not legally liable. Since he has found a valid rule of law which clearly applies to the facts of the case, he is confident that he is prepared for tomorrow\'s class.\n\n>Ann Kelsey is politically liberal and considers herself to be a caring individual. She believes that when doctors take the Hippocratic oath, they accept a special obligation to care for the sick, and that it would be wrong and set a terrible example for doctors to ignore the needs of regular patients who depend on them. For this reason, her initial impression of the solution to the hypothetical is that the doctor should be liable. Through her research, she discovers the case of *Cotnam v. Wisdom*, which establishes the rule that in the absence of an explicit contract, the law will imply a contractual relationship where such is necessary to avoid injustice. She believes that under the facts of the hypothetical, the failure to imply a contractual relationship would be obviously unjust. Therefore, she concludes that her initial impression was correct and that the doctor is legally liable.

But Bitcoin is not the only block chain. Altcoins may be used, though all have significantly less security and global availability than Bitcoin\'s block chain. Should side chains become available, alternative block chains can be anchored to the strength of Bitcoin.  \n\nBut the advantages and usefulness offered by block chains are already clear, which is increasingly becoming realized by large companies like Nasdaq, IBM, major banks, etc. Already, Bitcoin is the open-source block chain with the most development and innovation towards greater scalability. Companies like Factom are offering innovative ways to leverage data on the block chain while minimizing footprint. If use rises to the point that fees increase, this will drive such development even faster.  \n\n> The avengers movies sell upwards of 100 million tickets. The current blockchain would take months to handle a single movie. (please don\'t answer with "future theoretical developments make this a non-issue" because that is extremely disingenuous)  \n\nSmall businesses or blockbuster movies that sell 100 million tickets, pick your goal posts.   \n\nI\'m not saying Bitcoin today is instantly the solution to all things everywhere, but it absolutely represents a new potential solution that is open, accessible to everyone, and *already* is the most reachable provider of self-verifying, immutable data worldwide. For all sorts of commercial and economic innovation, it\'s a new path that did not previously exist.  \n\nThe fact that the block chain technology Bitcoin introduced can and is being duplicated at whim guarantees that scalability will always be dealt with in one way or another. Even if transaction growth on the Bitcoin block chain outpaces increased availability from both rapidly improving computing/networking/storage technology, and all other developments regarding scalability (which, given the pace of innovation and VC investment is definitely not a sure thing), as the strongest and largest such network, widespread use of other permisionless block chains will only serve to illustrate why a price premium would be reasonable for transacting on the strongest, most established chain. Therefore, should these circumstances arise, it\'s reasonable to anticipate Bitcoin would become the network for higher value transactions, for which the highest security and most available network are needed, and where any higher fees can be justified.  \n\nAll of the forgoing presupposes that Bitcoin will continue to exist and grow well into the future, something that can\'t be determined with any certainty at this early stage of its existence. But its immense promise coupled with the uncertainty of its future shed insight on the extreme volatility and massive value growth bitcoin price has exhibited over its early years.': -2, ">Customer A (original buyer) can't sell a ticket obtained this way to Customer B on a secondary market.\n\nWhy not? \n\n>That's the theater's decision to make.

I'm talking about a secondary market. Currently, the airline is the middleman. They have to be between each trade. Let me give you an example: lets say I book a ticket for $500. At the last minute someone needs to buy a seat on my flight and even though the flight is fully booked, the airline will sell them a ticket for $3,000. The airline will then make an offer to any passengers to get them on the next flight (value of $500) plus a $500 voucher. The airline spends a total of $1000 for the ticket they sell for $3000. The airline (middleman) pockets the difference for $2,000. If there was a blockchain based market for the tickets on this airline, the person taking the voucher could ask for $1,500 that is paid directly from the person wanting to buy the last minute ticket. Therefore, both the buyer and the seller would get a better deal at the expense of the airline (the middleman).": 0, 'A much more secure way to do this is with a special input that is sent to your address when you purchase the ticket.

This would iron out those misjudgments like nothing ever happened, and the airline would lose money while empowering the most accurate forecasters of demand (skilled resellers) to grow and respond even more adeptly in the future.\n\nConversely, there would be situations where resellers would be unable to sell at almost any price - i.e., situations where the airline vastly overcharged. Of course, the resellers who mis-anticipated the demand would lose out while those who correctly anticipated demand would have refused to purchase the extra tickets, so those most highly skilled forecasters would again have more funds to more adeptly respond to demand going forward should the airline for some reason lack skill in this area. Fortunately, even the failing resellers would serve a useful purpose in that you could get on the overpriced flight for cheaper because the resellers who foolishly bought extra tickets will want to dump them at any price. \n\nIn every case this creates a smoothing effect to better match supply with demand whenever the airline proves incapable of doing so. Essentially the airline is outsourcing its price planning, and paying for it as well :)\n\nThese resellers (scalpers) help everyone. Oh but wait! Some say these scalpers are evil because they buy all the tickets just so that they can resell for higher prices. But no, consider the above again: it is *only* in the case where the airline makes a mistake and prices the tickets too cheaply (versus demand) that the scalpers can make money, and again they make money by performing a valuable service. They ensure that the people who really need to take the flight can do so. Without the scalpers, you can\'t get on the flight at any time unless you were lucky enough to be able to buy the moment the tickets went on sale. And again, if the tickets *weren\'t* underpriced and this situation of you not being able to take a flight you really need *didn\'t* arise, the scalpers would be losing money and be forced to sell at a loss.\n\nScalpers are therefore a kind of investor, and like all investors they perform an [extremely valuable service](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=678866.5).

But I am just an ideas guy.  \n\nCertainly the costs associated with such ticketing systems rise with the size and complexity of the implementation. Personally, most single independent theaters I\'ve been to still use legacy systems, but *movie chains* are multimillion dollar operations that have integrated systems, and *still* likely pay a service provider that has done the development, deployment, testing, and back-end infrastructure work necessary to provide consistent, reliable service within their service area.  \n\nIf you start talking about nationwide or international train companies, or international airlines complexity and costs skyrocket, largely due to the infrastructure required to support such services.\n\nIt\'s true that new services like Passwallet and Passbook are springing up which are starting to make services more accessible, however [fees are inevitably attached](http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2409629,00.asp), privacy is lost, and you are chained to a centralized provider that can hold you hostage to their service and are likely not backed by a widespread global network of service nodes.  \n\nA block chain-based system, on the other hand, is instantly global with tremendously high availability. There is no cost to maintain or pay for server development, deployment, testing, mirroring, high-availability, data backup, bandwidth, security, cross-border regulations, etc., etc. There\'s no upgrading of software, patching of vulnerabilities, migration to new hardware, or paying of the staff which handles such things. And the back-end is completely independent, so no third-party is harvesting private information as part of the cost of offering the service. Nor can the block chain arbitrarily restrict or change your service.  \n\n> Train companies and airlines ticketing systems cost more but faaar below 1 million USD mark.  \n\nCitation please? These large companies certainly started their efforts for electronic ticketing systems 5, 10, even 15+ years ago. Imagine what the development costs have come to over the years. I wouldn\'t be surprised if the hosting costs for such services are in the multimillions per year, not to mention maintenance costs.  \n\nNow, any tiny company can leverage the block chain to build similar systems in possibly weeks, definitely within months. And be backed by a global network that can give them access to their records with unprecedented availability.\n\nEven today, I\'m sure development costs are continuing for big companies as well, since service areas grow and contract with business changes and international politics.

Although I used to be able to switch keyboards on the fly, apparently now this is only possible from the settings menu. That sucks. ~~In that case you are right and you would have to trust your keyboard provider because now the only way to implement this frictionlessly is to always use a changetip enabled keyboard.

Until two years ago, it was my belief too that inflation was evil and the perfect money should have a fixed number of units in circulation.  After watching what is happening to bitcoin and reading analyses of it by economists, now I know that a good currency needs to have an ever expanding supply,  and  lose purchasing power at a small rate, to discourage people from hoarding it.\n\nAs someone aptly observed, "bitcoin is the tool that the Devil invented to teach economics to the nerds"...': 2, '> Your points about gold are completely off the point and irrelevant. Bitcoin is like gold, not like cash.\n\nSorry, you are mistaken.  Bitcoin is not at all like gold, in any way.  (Except perhaps for being in a speculative bubble based on mistaken beliefs.)\n\nThe bitcoin protocol tried to imitate cash by adopting the UTXO/wallet metaphor (as opposed to the bank balance metaphor).  Economically, it is neither like gold nor like cash.  For one thing, bitcoin has a predetermined cap and creation schedule that does not depend on its price; whereas both gold and cash have practically unbounded total supply, and an unpredictable mining/printing rate that is strongly influenced by price,\n\n': 2, "> It's irrelevant if we know exactly how much gold there is. It's a finite amount, just as there are a finite amount of bitcoin.\n\nIt makes all the difference.  Bitcoin's cap is relevant *only because it is guaranteed to be exhausted in a known and short time frame*.  Suppose that the bicoin cap was 21 trillion instead of 21 million, and no one could predict how the block reward would change in the next 100 years, not even whether it would decrease or increase.  Then, the fact that the amount was ultimately finite would make absolutely no difference.  No sane person would invest today in a complicated financial-technological virtual instrument whose supply *may* run out 100 years in the future...\n\n> Bitcoin is in a massively expansive phase, the supply is inflating significantly\n\nBut the problem is not the inflation (that should cause a modest *decrease* of the price); it is the absurd *increase* in the price since 2009, that is not justified by its utility as payment.  That was due to speculative hoarding, due in turn to the expectation of even greater price increases in the future.  Its problems as a currency come from it being ultimately deflationary, not from being temporarily inflationary.\n\n": 2, 'There is a finite amount of gold in the earth (just as there are a finite amount of bitcoin programmed to be mined).  Do I really have to explain why the amount of gold mined must eventually decline?  Actually I believe we\'ve already hit "peak gold" and mining production has been in decline for years now despite improvements in mining production.\n\nAs for deflation, bitcoin is still in its inflationary stage.  Later when it starts to significantly deflate, if it becomes apparent it should instead continue to inflate that\'s a change that can be made (like was done to dogecoin).  I actually expect that will happen a few decades from now.  \n\nIn the meantime I wouldn\'t put too much stock in current economists bitching against deflation.  The economists currently in power are in power because their arguments support what is convenient for the powers that be and the systems they have implemented.  The reality is deflation is completely incompatible with a constantly expanding debt-based currency like we have now.  The dollar and our current system cannot continue in the form it does now in a deflationary environment, period.  The savings (or "hoarding" as they negatively call it) that is rewarded by deflation causes debt expansion to stop, pyramids of debt to default in cascades, and the fiat system to collapse.  This is not a failure of deflation, it\'s a failure of systems of ever-expanding debt. However there are other systems--in particular bitcoin isn\'t debt-based nor is gold, and neither suffer the same issues from deflation as debt-based fiat.': 1, '> There is a finite amount of gold in the earth [...\\. Do I really have to explain why the amount of gold mined must eventually decline? Actually I believe we\'ve already hit "peak gold".\n\nBy that argument, there is also a finite amount of paper, so the printing of dollars bills will also eventually decline.\n\nI repeat, gold deposits are hard to detect, so we do not  really know how much mineable gold there is.   Since the "peak oil" meme came up, shale oil became economical (perhaps) and huge sub-salt oil reserves have been discovered.    We have no idea of how much gold will be mined over the next 50 years.  It depends on the price of gold, for one thing.\n\n> In the meantime I wouldn\'t put too much stock in current economists bitching against deflation.\n\nWell, but I saw what is happening to bitcoin because it is claimed to be "deflationary".  It is just as the mainstream economists said:  because of the expectation of increasing value, people hoard it, which  makes its price shoot up, which causes even more hoarding, and so on.  Obviously that cannot go on forever, and it can only end with a humongous crash.\n\n Saving means postponing some of the consumption that one would be entitled to.  Hoarding currency is not the same thing as saving; it is just one particularly stupid form of saving, that is extremely risky for the individual, very bad for the currency, and bad for society because it essentially lends that money to anyone who happens to be holding some currency, whether he is a wealth producer or a consumer.  Investing in wealth-creating endeavors is a better way of saving, for all involved.  Putting money in a savings account also is not bad either, because the bank will loan that money to hopefully productive endeavors.\n\n\n': 2, 'I had no idea cash was deflationary, mined, or that the amount mined decreases over time.

Bitcoin is in a massively expansive phase, the supply is inflating significantly. Bitcoin won't be deflating for a long time yet.

They pretend they are the ones making your requests, then send the result back to you, encrypted. Anyone sniffing your traffic between you and the VPN server will only see that you talking to the VPN, but the traffic will be encrypted, so they won't know who the VPN is forwarding your traffic to. The VPN will be able to see your traffic, if it is unencrypted (HTTP instead of HTTPS), just like your friend can read the notes that you give him to pass to your crush, unless it's in a secret code. So use HTTPS when you use a VPN.\n\nThe VPN will be able to see your IP/MAC address and associate that with your account number, so keep that in mind. Moving around to different hotspots changes your IP, not your MAC. Changing your MAC address can be done from the command line.\n\nThis graphic is helpful, altho it's for Tor instead of a VPN, but the basic idea is the same.

This just further accelerates deflation and economic activity is brought to a halt.
