Can nobody answer it?\nI\'m not a technician, but I try. Please don\'t destroy me if I\'m wrong but correct me, that will help me to learn more. \n\n- the most important factor for mining centralization is the algorithm that allows ASICS (special chips made for mining). This hightens the initial investment to mining and increases the needed professionalism.\n\n- in the end, "mining centralization" is just "pool centralization". It\'s not clear how centralized the hash-power is. It may be that all the miners that spend their hashes to a pool are far more distrubited than you think.\n\n- The connection between blocksize and mining centralization are the orphans. If a miner needs too long to propagate a new block, there is a change, that another miner finds a block in this time and propagates it faster. So the block of the first miner will be invalid and called orphan. Now, the bigger the block, the longer it needs to propagate. This reason make 8 MB blocks extremely risky for miners, and no miner would ever fill such a big block as long as there are not excessives fees inside.\n\n- the orphan mechanism increases the burdens to mining when blocks get bigger. It\'s a bit like regulation - it increases costs and as a result only big players are able to survice. \n\n- it is feared that bigger blocks would increase this centralization mechanism.\n\n- Core devs are doing a lot to handle this problem:\n\n- Now I\'m technical way out of knowledge to tell you anything, cause it definitely will be wrong, but IBLT and weak / thin blocks are methods, to 1. increase he speed of block propagation 2. decrease the volume of data needed for a miner to propagate his block.\n\nAs I said: Whereever I\'m wrong, please correct me. \n\nEdit: This chart https://blockchain.info/charts/n-orphaned-blocks?timespan=2year&showDataPoints=false&daysAverageString=1&show_header=true&scale=0&address= sho shows the number of orphan blocks since april 2014.

looking at it from a different perspective, but I am seeing a group who lobbies for bitcoin at the core.  An organization such as this will always need revenue for marketing and operational costs, as well to reimburse qualified individuals to carry out the tasks effectively.  At the same time, I don't believe in any context that they should act as seniority in the community or decision wise for anything that has the potential to affect the ecosystem as a whole.     \n   \nAt the end of the day Bitcoin already has representation by the merchants accepting it, companies providing services, ATM's and clubs, but a unified foundation that focused on marketing Bitcoin with a consistent image in regions of interest probably wouldn't be the worst step toward reaching the ideal segment effectively.": 1, 'Because they have for better or worse attempted to claim the mantle of representing the Bitcoin community as a whole.

I think this comment illustrates one fundamental problem with your article.\n\nWhen you talk about the Bitcoin Foundation and say "They" did any of these things -- it\'s important to not that the current people didn\'t....past administrations did.  \n\nThey did what they did, I get the criticism.  For the things we can undue I\'ve worked to do that....but we are where we are now.  This thing exists, it\'s here and it\'s an opportunity or mess that belongs to everyone -- it\'s no more my foundation than it is yours...in fact I\'m newer and was an opponent until I joined.\n\nSame goes for focusing on the financials past, I just don\'t see how an audit benefits anyone at this point.  You don\'t really think people who are strong critics will suddenly say "Oh, finally, we proved that the foundation wasted money and past people involved were bad actors.  I have no problem with this group now." right?\n\nWe all know that the old members of the foundation burned through lots of money, they also lost millions on the decline in Bitcoin value.  We all know that past people made errors and that we had bad apples.  What could an audit show that we don\'t already know?  Unless we can collect some huge six figure pile of cash that someone squirreled away then I don\'t see the use of what it could show,   Surely it couldn\'t be much worse right?  It\'s not like we could find even more wasted money than we knew of.\n\nIt would make total sense of the people involved were still there: hold them accountable, fire them if needed or sue them or whatever.  But they are not there anymore.\n\nI\'d be more than happy to release any records of current spending or any spending I\'ve approved or been responsible for...that makes perfect sense.  This is a turnaround situation -- when a person or team is brought in to fix something the only thing they need to know about the past is enough to not repeat the same mistakes and to collect or close any relevant loops.\n\nIf this whole thing was dumped in your lap and you had total control, would an audit really be the priority?

Currently, more than 51% of the hashpower is owned by 5 entities (it\'s not hashpower provided to the pools by individual miners).\n\n\nAnyway, my reaction after having computed the score for R3 was the same :D\n\n\nBut let\'s think about it one more time.

I want to believe that big mining operators are still independent economic actors but I think it\'s also important to face the reality: almost all exchanges apply some KYC/AML procedures because they\'re required to by their local regulator or because they don\'t want to take the risk to be sued in the future.\n\n\nIMHO, with such a level of centralization, it\'s just a just a matter of time before a part of the mining ecosystem is regulated / influenced / coerced by state entities.\n\n\nAs bitcoin believers, our natural answer is to say that economic incentive wills prevent this situation but the truth is that bitcoin doesn\'t live in a vacuum. It exists in a political world. And political decisions aren\'t all motivated by economic factors. If it was the case, the history of national debts would be very different ;)\n\n\nMoreover, forcing bitcoin to follow a dead-end isn\'t a problem for governments.
