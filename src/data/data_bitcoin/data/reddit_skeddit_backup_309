It shows that although miner\'s with a large portion of the network hash rate have an advantage over small miners, this advantage *decreases* as the block reward drops or as total fees increases. \n\nThis is important because it shows the second-order concern brought up by Dave Hudson regarding the health of the fee market (in the absence of a block size limit) actually gets reduced (a) if blocks become bigger and include more fees in total, and (b) as time progresses and the block reward becomes less important.  \n\n\n ^1 To make the math tractable, the paper above made the simplifying assumption that the chance a miner mined two blocks in a row was small enough to ignore. ': 17, "In that far future situation when the block subsidy fades out, the optimal strategy for the better connected miners will be to steal the previous transaction fees (in case they were on a more limited block) and add the new ones.\n\nThere is also the argument of vanishing rent, for which the marginal cost of successfully propagating a transaction (i.e., in a block that does not get orphaned) equals the marginal revenue of its fee, and thus there is no revenue left for hashing.\n\nAnyway, in a few decades we will have switched to extract a mining reward from Meni's fee pool or a similar solution.\n\n> or as total fees increase\n\nThis is what applies nowadays.

Other miners identify them and they start mining on top of their headers as soon as they are announced and before downloading the blocks (SPV mining). In most cases, it is profitable to do this. If generalized, this practice makes the orphaning rate insignificant and, most importantly, size independent.\n\nThis is not true.  Although a miner may begin mining on just the header while he works to receive/validate the full block, if--in the meantime--he fully receives and validates a small block, he will then orphan the larger block.  He does this because it is better to build upon a block that you are 100% sure is valid.\n\nThe results of the papers still apply. \n\n': 4, 'jonny1000, the reasoning you cite totally misses the mark.  Here\'s why:\n\nThe "marginal cost of including a transaction" is a *derivative with respect to blocksize*.  Pinna computes an optimal blocksize relation and then uses it to examine the question of miner centralization.\n\nThe *equilibrium network difficulty* is not even discussed in this paper, which assumes constant exchange rate, and constant network hashrate H.  Clearly that equilibrium is heavily influenced by the exchange rate and obviously, the greater the exchange rate, the greater the equilibrium network hashrate (or equivalently, difficulty).  \n\nThis paper separates out very different quantitative factors that have led to confused thinking thus far.\n\n': 3, 'Bitcoin dev list: https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2015-August/010715.html': 7, 'I have added a Dropbox link.': 4, 'Yes the paper may seperate them apart.

On the other hand, if she SPV mines instead on top of the announce header, it will be easier that the block gets accepted as there is no race at all (plus this consolidates the previous, huge block). This is thus the optimal strategy.\n\nHeaders of a multi-block chain from known, reputable pools are nearly as trustable as single blocks, as long as the trailing blocks are empty or contain only newly seen transactions. Eventually, everything gets validated and the network synchronizes (we know that for Bitcoin to reach Byzantine consensus, the propagation time should be on average much shorter than the block time).': 1, 'in the next email: jtimon is worried that 2MB might be too large. \n\nhttp://imgur.com/gallery/iWKad22': -2, 'Correct /u/Peter__R!\n\nThe only correction I\'d add is that I am not flat out assuming that the chance a miner mined two blocks in a row was small enough to ignore.

The reason is because average transaction fees will be equal to the marginal orphan risk increase and therefore there is no additional revenue to subsidies the cost of hashing. Therefore the equilibrium difficulty will be too low and we have a problem.  I am not sure if this is correct because the marginal cost of orphan risk will be unique to each miner, therefore one could draw an industry marginal orphan risk cost curve and some miners would make more profits than others, this dynamic could be sufficient to ensure high enough equilibrium difficulty.  Although it implies better connected miners are more profitable and therefore may increase centralization.  Although this does make this idea significantly superior to the ideas about arbitrarily fining miners a uniform amount for larger blocks, because this cost is the same for all miners there will be no cost curve and therefore no cross subsidy for hashing, which will result in equilibrium difficulty being too low. \n\n * Gavin and others have argued that computer science has come a long way in the last 20 years.  For example bandwidth speeds and increased and storage costs have come down.  This is often cited as a reason supporting BIP101, because transferring 8GB is expected to be much cheaper in 20 years time.  I broadly agree with this line of thought.  However ironically this makes me more concerned about BIP101, because these technological improvements may mean the marginal cost of orphan risk, when including an additional transaction into a block, will get closer to zero over time or at least become insignificant.  Therefore I consider this point a large negative when evaluating the viability of a fee market without a blocksize limit.\n\n * I am also concerned about using orphan risk as the mechanism for ensuring a fee market.  Operating this way may imply the orphan risk will constantly be pushed to the limit.  This is not good for the health of the network and reduces the ability of the network to effectively and decisively come to consensus about the state of the blockchain.  I also consider this point a negative when evaluating the viability of a fee market without a blocksize limit.\n\n\n*1 - The fact that verifying and transmitting transactions has a cost isn\'t enough, because all the funds go to pay that cost and none to the POW "artificial" cost. - http://sourceforge.net/p/bitcoin/mailman/message/34090559/*\n': 11, 'Thank you.': 4, 'Sorry.

Primarily, I find that your paper (and also Peter R's) address poorly these concerns:\n\n - Most blocks are mined by big, reputable pools. Other miners identify them and they start mining on top of their headers as soon as they are announced and before downloading the blocks (SPV mining). In most cases, it is profitable to do this. If generalized, this practice makes the orphaning rate insignificant and, most importantly, size independent.\n\n - Big miners can easily coordinate their mempool policies and then quickly synchronize the blocks (through IBLT or other means) without having to download them. In a situation with blacklists and censored transactions used by big cartels, smaller independent miners would be at disadvantage, i.e., orphaning would be highly asymmetric.\n\n - The expected reward from the block subsidy grows linearly with the hashing power and so there is no centralizing force for it. However, once we consider connectivity, big, better connected miners have an advantage over the less connected (because they self-limit at larger sizes and so earn more fees): It is no longer linear and ultimately the small guys are forced out or, at least, to sell their hashing power to a stratum pool.\n\n - Related to the previous point: Selfish mining and bitundo are profitable at the individual level. Both strategies benefit more the larger miners, and both are more profitable with increased propagation friction.": 3, "> The expected reward from the block subsidy grows linearly with the hashing power and so there is no centralizing force for it.

Brown, Jr.\n\nre.:  AB 1326 - Virtual Currency\n\nDear Governor Brown,\n\nI am writing you today in my capacities as Chair of the Education Committee of the Bitcoin Foundation and as a member of the New Money Systems Board of the Lifeboat Foundation \n(profile at http://lifeboat[dot]com/ex/bios[dot]colin[dot]gallagher).\n\nSome while ago, I was pleased to see that legislation relating to currency which could be used in this state was passed by the Legislature and signed into law.  That was AB 129 ('Lawful Money,' approved by Governor June 28, 2014, filed with Secretary of State June 28, 2014). The passage of that law freed innovators in the state so that they would not have to be concerned with unreasonable regulation.  And it's worked out very well thus far.  Unfortunately, the Legislature seems to have taken renewed interest in harsher language which would restrict innovation in this state under the terms of Dababneh's proposed AB 1326.  This bill picks up where New York left off, and AB 1326 is so bad that the Electronic Frontier Foundation launched a advocacy campaign against AB 1326.  \n\nAB 1326 in fact, would place oppressive requirements on anyone who is conducting a \xe2\x80\x9cvirtual currency business\xe2\x80\x9d ~ specifiying that this would include anyone at all, whose business model would be \xe2\x80\x9cdetermined by the commissioner\xe2\x80\x9d ~ including, but not limited to, people whose business represents \xe2\x80\x9clow or no risk to consumers!\xe2\x80\x9d  While a \xe2\x80\x9cvirtual currency business\xe2\x80\x9d under the proposed law \xe2\x80\x9cmeans maintaining full custody or control of virtual currency in this state on behalf of others,\xe2\x80\x9d such businesses as exchanges, brokerages, or other firms which routinely hold private keys to virtual currency for customers, are already regulated heavily by the US Treasury (specifically, by FinCEN) and are subject to federal licensing requirements, and thus need no additional state licensing.  But the wording of the bill, rather than addressing who is holding the private keys, is unnecessarily vague, stating \xe2\x80\x9cfull custody or control of virtual currency in this state on behalf of others.\xe2\x80\x9d  Thus, even small businesses who want to accept virtual currencies as payment for their goods and services will be discouraged from doing so.\n\nFurthermore, this proposed bill does not have any exemptions that clearly exempt currency innovators in the state (such as myself) and startups from its provisions.  The exemption section proposed states that \xe2\x80\x9cA person shall not engage in any virtual currency business in this state unless the person is licensed or exempt from licensure under this division.\xe2\x80\x9d What does its exemption say with respect to ordinary users?  \xe2\x80\x9cA merchant or consumer that utilizes virtual currency solely for the purchase or sale of goods or services.\xe2\x80\x9d  Thus, what if my software doesn't use virtual currency solely for the purchase or sale of goods or services, but rather, uses it for the purpose of donation of virtual currency to another user ~ as is in fact the case with a cryptocurrency project I have developed (known as ABIS) and implemented (within the cryptocurrency known as BCN)?  There are virtual currency use cases and indeed entire virtual currency systems which are set up to do exactly that \xe2\x80\x93 microgiving.  The giving and microgiving cases are actually ruled out (deemed to be illegal, because they are not exempt) by AB 1326!\n\nLet's take a look at another exemption, \xe2\x80\x9cA person or entity developing, distributing, or servicing a virtual currency network software.\xe2\x80\x9d  There are no exemptions for development of startups associated with virtual currency!\n\nWhen New York began implementing its requirements that many virtual currency users would have to be registered and be licensed with the state of New York, and additional requirements such as identification of users and submittal of information to the FBI (to name a few), it was immediately evident that such requirements are inimical to free speech and expression.  Many companies opted to leave the state of New York or have ceased to operate in New York as a result.\n\nA partial list of the companies that immediately left New York were:\nBitfinex, BitQuick, BTCGuild, Eobot, Genesis Mining, GoCoin, Kraken, LocalBitcoins, Paxful, and Poloniex.  \xe2\x80\x9cThis particular piece of legislation is unnecessary and is an obstacle to free market innovation,\xe2\x80\x9d wrote Genesis Mining on its blog in response to New York's approach. Kraken, an exchange headquartered in San Francisco, said that the license, \xe2\x80\x9ccomes at a price that exceeds the market opportunity of servicing New York residents. Therefore, we have no option but to withdraw our service from the state.\xe2\x80\x9d  These companies and more will make a similar exodus from California if AB 1362 is adopted.\n\nThese companies are regulated and subject to federal MSB licensing by FinCEN.  Federal regulation in this area focuses on the exchanges and brokerages. Virtual currency, however, is dynamic and evolving quickly, and you should not expect compliance or widespread support for state-level regulation.  There are over seven hundred decentralized virtual currencies or decentralized and distributed peer to peer currency systems (the vast majority are non-corporate projects which simply live as decentralized software repositories), and more are being made constantly. As they develop, the state must must step back and allow innovators to continue their work unhindered so that California can blossom as a hub of progress. \n\nCalifornia has a decision to make ~ to follow in the footsteps of New York (and be left in the dust as companies and innovators leave the state), or to reject AB 1326 and work directly with innovators, and encourage them to do everything possible here in California to advance new and bold cryptocurrency initiatives.\n\n\nSincerely,\nColin Gallagher ": 4, 'Its garbage like change org or any of that crap.

This whole notion of miners voting is going to be incredibly messy, and introduces quite a bit of potential volatility to the maximum block size.

I wrote a similar proposal a few months before you here: [Individual Block Difficulty Based on Block Size](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=956442.0;topicseen)\n\nI also am probably not the first to think of this.\n\nOne issue I had when I was thinking through this proposal was that it allows a miner to inflate their effective hash rate by mining smaller blocks. This was pointed out initially by jonny1000.\n\nIf a miner has 30% of the network hashing power, and the minimum difficulty is 50%, they can switch to mining blocks that are 50% less than blocksize cap and for the purposes of longest POW chain they have 60% of the network hashrate.\n\nI let my thread die because both Greg and Gavin had seen it, and because I didn\'t have a solid proposal to prevent this attack.\n\nThe key to your proposal is that the range is limited to a rather narrow band. I think this is better than what I proposed, but it is not clear that this solves all the problems.\n\n* 1. If we found ourselves in a situation where the block size needed to rise quickly, it is possible that almost all miners would be producing 25% larger blocks. Even if the range is bound to the +-25% as you proposed, this leaves room for a nefarious miner to mine a 25% smaller block while all his peers are voting for large blocks and inflate his effective hash power by 60%... that\'s a pretty big advantage. It might even be large enough for him to start orphaning blocks or perform a 51% attack.\n* 2. Everyone will be incentivised to mine for the first 20 seconds after a new block with the lowest possible difficulty (so 25% smaller block) until they can validate the block they received. This means any time there is are successive blocks solved, they will automatically be votes cast for smaller blocks.\n* 3. Voting for the status quo actually costs something, since you\'re missing out on the "rebate" you get when you cast a vote for smaller blocks. For all effective purposes, the miners will consider the 25% smaller block to be the baseline since it cost them something to vote for the nominal block size.\n\nAs a counter proposal, consider this: What if any vote costs extra POW, whether for an increase or decrease in the block size?\n\nI\'m fairly certain that your proposal as it stands opens new attack vectors and also decreases the threshold for a 51% attack to 51%*(min_difficulty/max_difficutly) under situations where the majority of the network is mining at max_difficutly.': 1, "I didn't say they were infallible.": 0, "I don't understand why a max blocksize solution that relates to a metric doesn't exist.

I don\'t know why he\'s invoking "blockstream" there.\n\nI asked Jeff on IRC what specifically the 75% that was in his document meant:\n\n\n\n13:44 <gmaxwell> Technical question, it\'s unclear to the writeup how exactly you suggest miners signal their new size preference?  are you thinking that mine\nrs express a preferred size in their blocks, and then the 75-th percentile size is used? (subject to the 2x limit) ?\n \n...\n\n13:50 <gmaxwell> What made you go for 75%?\n\n...\n\n13:52 <jgarzik> 75% = political science.  3/4 majority. \n\n...\n\n14:09 <gmaxwell> as far as the actual mechenism (which I don\'t see in the BIP); what I\'d guess is that each block would express a preferred limit in the coinbase, next to the height,  and then at the update period those limits would get processed? e.g. taking the n-th percentile?  \n\n14:10 <gmaxwell> (if that detail is in the bip, I\'m missing it)  \n\n...\n\n14:14 <jgarzik> Anyway, on the BIP 100, basically the floor (least) of the range of most popular miner suggested sizes  \n\n14:14 <jgarzik> "we all agree on this floor"  \n\n14:15 <gmaxwell> jgarzik yea, if it took all the sizs, sorted, and then discarded 25% of the smallest ones, then took the smallest remaining size, it would accomplish that.\n\n14:16 <jgarzik> size can decrease too, with 1MB absolute minimum.  \n\n14:16 <gmaxwell> though maybe a number different than 75/25 would be good, I should talk to petertodd and see if his position would be changed if, say, it were 90%/10%.   Basically if you\'re below 5% hashpower you\'re not even getting a block per day on average, and so you couldn\'t even be doing much to prevent censorship.  \n\n14:18 <gmaxwell> But e.g. should be we changing how the limit works slightly, e.g. making the \'size\' include the change in the utxo size as I\'d proposed before? so that the limit actually reflects the real costs in the network; .. absent something like that fees will never peanlize costly behavior there.\n\n14:18 <jgarzik> nod - IMV tweaking those constants are easy while getting us past the 1MB hard fork\n\n14:18 <jgarzik> & addressing governance are the hard parts\n\n14:19 <jgarzik> agree RE UTXO - economically signaling those costs is important\n\n\nI believe this is the entirety of my conversion with Jeff on the subject.  (I\'ve removed many interspersed comments because IRC usually bifurcates into multiple threads of discussion due to latency; but I believe they are unrelated to this topic).  AFAICT, I never suggested 20%  but rather suggested a sensible meaning for what a 75% threshold might mean in his scheme, which to my eyes was under-defined but might have already meant that.\n\nI don\'t think there is anything wrong with 20% as things go; though the main limitation in BIP100 (assuming any of the under-specified parts are filled in with things I find unobjectionable) is that it addresses only miner-vs-miner incentives issues, and even then only under assumptions about hashrate distribution which are currently untrue (e.g. right now less than one percent of the miners have >>50% of the hashrate, so BIP100 is basically a blank check to those few parties up to the 32MB limit).\n\nJeff\'s stated view is that users can be protected by exiting Bitcoin if miners are not acting perfectly, but there is incredible friction around markets (e.g. solution via exodus guarantees losers)-- "sell all your bitcoins and go use something else, is a really weak threat, in general. Because of the weakness of the threat I don\'t think this is a reasonable first-resort mechanism for assuring the security of the system-- I think we\'ve already seen it disproved in practice, and under that argument, e.g. we could just give miners the ability to print infinite bitcoin, steal arbitrary coins, etc.\n': 27, '? An exchange that allows trading of two currencies makes twice as much on fees.\n\n': 2, "Don't all this non 50/50 systems give power to an even smaller group of miners? Needing 80% means 20% can stop any increase or decrease.\n\nWhy not just let every miner pick a position: halve(-1)/stay(0)/increase(+1) and then only trigger a change if it is supported by 50+% of the blocks, it will happen. Otherwise the limit stays the same.\n\nThis gives control to the miners when 50%+ supports a change. Which seems fair because no miner has the VETO power when he controls 20%+ of the hashrate, which seems the opposite of decentralization. ": 1, 'Great post, thanks.  I am pleased you look as if you could support BIP100.  Also its great you are sceptical and looking for potential weaknesses in BIP100.  Bitcoin is better because of you, and knowing a mind like yours is looking for security issues, helps me sleep more easily.\n\nDo you know what the 20% rule means?  Is it the lowest 20% for an increase and highest 20% for a decrease?  Or is it just the lowest 20% for an increase and decrease in the limit?': 2, "Well that's more like how the decision was made rather than the reason. Would love to hear some real answer from /u/jgarzik to the @lopp question.\n\nAlso the BIP indeed states 32MB, so I don't get his tweet about the limit being completely removed.": 6, "> The main problem is that it enables a single miner that holds just 21% of mining power to DoS the network.\n\nIt doesn't-- however. A majority of the hashpower can, at cost, deny anyone they choose from voting (or block) any particular vote by simply orphaning their blocks. So there is no risk in that proposal that someone can make the system just stop working. \n\nYou solved this yourself too! :)": 1, '>Jeff\'s stated view is that users can be protected by exiting Bitcoin if miners are not acting perfectly, ~~but~~ because there is incredible friction around markets (e.g. solution via exodus guarantees losers)-- "sell all your bitcoins and go use something else"\n\nThat is a *horrible* system for checks and balances.\n\nThat\'s saying "let the system actually get to the point of failure and then when people are so dissatisfied and they sell their bitcoin, the miners will see and learn they weren\'t satisfied."\n\nBy that time it has already caused immense damage.': 23, "The main problem is that it enables a single miner that holds just 21% of mining power to DoS the network. Assume the network is happily chugging around at 32 MB, with blocks full to the brim and fees around 5 ct per tx. Lots of people use Bitcoin and rely on it. Maybe, there is even a Lightining network operating which relies on timely confirmations to settle in cases of malicious actors.\n\nNow, said 21% miner decides that he isn't making enough money (while other miners are happy with the current situation). However, 21% guy gets the block size halved. Fees skyrocket, existing businesses break, and fraud is enabled on Lightning network.\n\n21% guy decided to exit the business once his mining equipment gets obsolete and his free power contract runs out because that new power line is finally getting finished, so he doesn't give a shit about the long-term perspective of Bitcoin. He continues voting to halve once again. (This shows why allowing lowering based on the 20th percentile is dangerous.)\n\nThe likely outcome would be, IMHO, that a few big players decide that enough is enough, Bitcoin can't go to shit due to one asshole, and 51% attack him by orphaning his blocks.": 2, "Yes, yes, no. In the case of this specific upcoming hardfork, coins will be able to spent on both of the new forks. It could effectively double people's holdings, and exchanges would trade BQT and BXT - not hard to imagine. They don't need to run nodes, Bitfinex for example relies on a third party to hold its coins (in multisig).": 1, "How would that work exactly? If an exchange ran both versions of the forked nodes on separate hosts, would they be then responsible for separating the inventory of coins? And would a deposit of pre-fork coins be payable on both chains? Technically they would be, so is the exchange going to have to ensure that they don't? Sounds like another MtGox waiting to happen. ": 1, "> A majority of the hashpower can, at cost, deny anyone they choose from voting (or block) any particular vote by simply orphaning their blocks.\n\nThis requires a non-consensus softfork though and violates the expected protocol. I don't think we should rely on that as a regular control measure.": 1, "Why is it not safer to have at least N% support a change in any direction?  E.g. the 20th percentile for an increase and 80th percentile for a decrease, therefore each change has at least 80% support.  This removes some of the politics from the number.  I interpreted Jeff's proposal to mean this and then spread the idea around, but I think I was making too much of an assumption.\n\nYou calling this potentially pretty useful is briliant.": 5, 'A mean might be dangerous also, if the block size max can double every 3 months we could get 8GB blocks in just 3 years if 50% of the miners want it.\n': 2, 'A mean wouldn\'t be very sane, I think: \n\nFour animals are voting on if they should change their dinner plans from spam to something else.  If there are three wolves and one sheep who, collectively, vote [sheep, sheep, sheep, spam]  should they have sheep (median), spam(lower 25%tile), or 3/4 sheep + 1/4 spam (mean)?\n\nAt least to the extent that the size is honestly expressing a "I can handle this much, due to margins, connectivity, etc. and no more", a decision to use higher than someones preference is a decision to exclude them from the system.\n\nUltimately a majority of miners can collude to exclude everyone else, but assuming that they are playing nicely-- how much is acceptable to exclude? ... I don\'t think half is a good answer. :)  and Jeff didn\'t either before speaking to me, as his original text needed a 3/4 majority.\n\nMean also doesn\'t make sense from another perspective, in that e.g. I could falsely vote 10000TB in order to drag up the mean to something large, no matter how many other blocks disagreed. ': 8, 'I\'m sorry but that\'s not how it\'s going to work. This fantasy world of selling coins on either side of "two forks" at various exchanges is not going to happen. It would be financially idiotic to be on the losing side of a fork, so no exchange will do it.
