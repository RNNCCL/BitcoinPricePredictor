Generally speaking, there are many forms a decentralized fiat-crypto exchange can take.\n\nOne of the prominent features will probably be this: Instead of having one exchange hold all the funds, users will be able to select arbiters based on their reputation. \n\nArbiters will build their reputation by facilitating exchanges, proving reserves, and lowering fees. You can imagine an arbiter as being similar to the buyers and sellers on Local Bitcoins, except rather than depositing cash at the time of the transaction to simply purchase coins (or vise versa), you can choose to hold an account with the arbiter that enables you to buy and sell.\n\nTo increase liquidity in the market, arbiters will trade among themselves. However, arbiters themselves will not exchange fiat directly but rather swap CFD's (contract for difference) expressed in BTC and settle those CFD's in BTC for the dollar amount. This would allow them to exchange the *value* of dollars quickly by using cryptocurrency while simultaniously using a trustless system that's hard coded.\n\nIn the longterm the arbiter they trade with most will probably be a decentralized autonmous corporation, owned by no one that holds BTC and uses smart contracts to process CFD's for arbiters (or anyone holding crypto).": 3, 'If someone pays you for your used bicycle via bank transfer, do you need to show a contract?': 3, "Hm.

But there is an open risk here because basically every bank can make a chargeback specially if a crime is involved (Alice used a stolen bank account).\nIn that case the arbitrator cannot help anymore as the BTC payment has been already released. But Bob can contact the arbitrator to report that fraud and the arbitrator will put Alice on a global fraud report. That will make Alice\'s account useless, as every trader will check the other peer against that fraud report before starting a trade.\nOf course Alice could just register a new account and repeat the scam. But there are certain reasons why that will not be efficient for her.\n1. We store the encrypted bank account details in the blockchain with the registration. During the trade process the other trader can verify that the bank details are matching the one from the registration. So Alice cannot reuse her bank account. She need to use another bank account. But she cannot create 100s of bank accounts as that will alert the banks with AML monitoring. So her potential repeat rate is limited.  \n2. The trade volume is limited. The limit will be initially small like 1 or 2 btc, later we can relax that limit up to 5 or 10 btc, depending on the experience. A criminal using a stolen bank account want to cash out all the money in once not only a few hundred dollars. So Bitsquare will not be a good option for him.  \n3. If Alice repeat to request a bank chargeback she will make herself suspicious to her bank. For most banks it is a lot of paper work and they don\'t start that process easily (see above we will not support those where chargeback is easy).  \n4. If there is a high fraud rate additional security measurement can be used. We will offer OPTIONAL bank account and/or identity verification against an arbitrator. So if a user decides he wants to have a higher reputation with an "I am verified" icon, he can do that, but its completely optional. Only the arbitrator knows then the bank account data or in case of ID verification the data used for ID verification (different levels from social network ID to real life ID). We think that this measurement might be only needed in regions with a general higher fraud rate. The user can define from which country (seat of bank account) he accepts trades, so regions with a high fraud rate will stay isolated and will trigger those additional measurements to make the trade safer there.  \n5. Every trade contains a contract signed by both parties. In fraud case the users can use that contract out of system to use the traditional legal system. Again that is completely optional, we don\'t support that in any form directly, but the contract which is available might be useful if a user will go that path.  \n\nIn summary: We try to minimize that risk by a set of measurements and to try to make it not preferable for criminals to use Bitsquare for their activities.  \nThere will never be a 100% safety, same like for any other process where money is involved (a friend of mine was victim of a stolen bank account case at localbitcoin and lost his money, remember MtGox,...)\n\nFor more details see:  \nhttp://bitsquare.io/risk_analysis.pdf\n ': 8, "What would they do if the fiat recipient refuses to verify that fiat money was received or the sender sends them fake documentation for fiat deposits?

This layer also allows people to speculate on BTC without actually holding it (which some will prefer). Those with BTC can directly exchange cryptographic smart CFD\'s, but if they want to cash out in fiat they can use any arbiter (or any other way people sell their BTC).\n\nThe advantage of using separate layers is that if any one arbiter fails none of the customers who used them to get BTC will be exposed. Accounts held in fiat will be at risk, but arbiters will be vetted by reputation (as we see on LBC) and the overall risk to people using such a platform will be lower since many arbiters will compete to provide services. There are, no doubt other measures that arbiters can offer to attract customers who may want to open fiat accounts with arbiters, like security deposits that settle in BTC to the customers wallet (or something).': 1, 'so yet another middleman?': 2, 'The guy you are going to trade with AFAIK, the arbitrator network would be in charge of escrowing the bitcoins.': 6, "Well, no, it's a huge step forward from the traditional exchange model.

They may seek legal counsel but they may not reveal the fact they received a letter to those who are not directly involved with responding to the letter nor the public so the exact number of letters going out nor the companies receiving them will not be revealed by those affected without legal consequences.\nWe have obtained six of these letters, each of them slightly different and each of them being sent out by a different Enforcement division attorney at various regional SEC offices. Companies that have not yet received a letter or whom do not receive on in the next two weeks should not feel they are in the clear as the agency is not yet sending out all the letters as to not tip their hand before other actions or because of international cooperation.\n\nThese letters are but a small part of an interagency, international, cooperative action that will be detailed in-depth in an upcoming feature that ultimately results in action against several large bitcoin and cryptocurrency companies that have offered unregistered securities.\nFederal agencies said to be included are the SEC, Internal Revenue Service (IRS), the Department of Justice (DOJ) and we have unconfirmed reports that FinCen has also become involved recently.\n\nSeveral members of the Coin Fire staff initially questioned the validity of IRS accountants being used in an SEC investigation but our executive editor Mike would later learn from an unnamed source that is familiar with the procedures used that the tactic is common.\n\nBudget cuts have left several federal agencies unable to dedicate staff to the accounting process and that oftentimes a specific accounting team at the IRS could be called in to aid with other federal operations.

The IRS employs over 2,800 special agents for these type of investigations and they are oftentimes lent to other agencies.\n\nEach letter requests a detailed narrative on how the information requested is gathered, all corporate documents and agreements, all financial documents including all accounting books, tax information, a detailed listing of all bank accounts and information foreign and domestic, and details of all assets of the company.\n\xe2\x80\x9c\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDocument\xe2\x80\x9d shall include, but is not limited to, any written, printed, or typed matter including, but not limited to all drafts and copies bearing notations or marks not found in the original, letters and correspondence, interoffice communications, slips, tickets, records, worksheets, financial records, accounting documents, bookkeeping documents, memoranda, reports, manuals, telephone logs, telegrams, facsimiles, messages of any type, telephone messages, voice mails, tape recordings, notices, instructions, minutes, summaries, notes of meetings, file folder markings, and any other organizational indicia, purchase orders, information recorded by photographic process, including microfilm and microfiche, computer printouts, spreadsheets, and other electronically stored information, including but not limited to writings, drawings, graphs, charts, photographs, sound recordings, images, and other data or data compilations that are stored in any medium from which information can be retrieved, obtained, manipulated, or translated.\n\xe2\x80\x94 SEC Action Letter\n\nThe letters are being sent out to companies performing offerings on Counterparty, Cryptostocks, companies hosting offerings with colored coins, and companies who have performed unregistered securities offerings via Bitcoin Talk.

Expensive compared to none-blockchain transactions. Because the whole mining thing that is setup to process the transactions, and protect the integrity of the blockchain and so on, is very resource intensive, compared to other payment mechanisms. On top of that, the way bitcoin is designed, there can only be so many transactions per minute. Right now, i think the limit is around 2500 every 10 minute, because of the blocksize limit. You can increase the limit, you can maybe double it, or triple it, but you still end up with a rather limited amount of transactions per minute, compared to how many transactions there might be, if "everyone" is to be using bitcoin and blockchain transactions. Basically the way i see it, the miner fee you pay, is more of a bid, than a fee. The highest bidders, get in the first block, and so on. Now i am not an expert at all, and dont quote me on this tbh. but i think these things put together are going to push up the tx fee, and this makes blockchain transactions relatively expensive and unfit for small day to day transactions so to speak.': 2}, ('bitnodes down', 2): {"I received a 'down' alert email as well though my node has been running smoothly.
