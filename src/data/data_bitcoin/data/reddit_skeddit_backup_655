But the one thing I think is grossly overestimated (and I heard it from you) is the power of the "miners".\n\nIf a set of mining pools (say, 75% of hashing power) decided to jump on a fork that changed the Bitcoin Protocol: they, of course, could. Their chain then is longer, and therefore valid, right?\n\nNot exactly.\n\nNobody considers the power "everyone else" has to rebel.\n\nSay the "bad" miners want to change the protocol with 75% of mining power.\n\nThe "good" actors would stay on the old fork. The "old" "good" fork would contain only 25% of mining power... so it quickly becomes shorter. So its doomed, right?  BUT here\'s the catch. PLEASE HELP PEOPLE GET THIS: Non-miners who make up a serious part of the ecosystem would have to choose which fork to stay on. So, this includes big, important players like: Coinbase, Blockchain.info, Bitstamp, Circle, BitPay, Bitfinex, BTC-e, BTCChina, etc..... And all their userbases!   IF these big players chose to stay on the shorter chain, the "good" fork, then while the "bad" miners would have a majority of the hashing power and a longer chain, their longer chain would be relegated mostly useless, on par with the testnet = worthless bitcoins...  BECAUSE at that point the coins on the longer "bad" chain are no good at Bitstamp, Coinbase, BitPay, Blockchain.info, etc. then the miners would very quickly realize that mining worthless coins that nobody recognizes is not profitable. A rational miner at that point would not lose their profits by mining unrecognized coins, they\'d switch back.\n\nPLEASE stop the worshiping of the miners, there are other players with social and "utility" power that have just as big of a say in the chain.  This, I believe, extends the consensus mechanism beyond the miners to companies that represent "use" and indeed "users" of the blockchain. Further, users can choose companies who picked the fork on the blockchain they approve of. So, the average end user still has more say than they realize. Average users are not victim to the majority of hashing power.\n\nThe part I think gets missed FAR too often is that, Bitcoin is more than a technical beast. If you look at forks and hashing power only from a technical perspective, a miner perspective, you miss half the picture. Bitcoin is a social experiment also, filled with human beings with choices made for various reasons: some ideological, some ignorant, some financially motivated, others just want the damn thing to work so they can buy dinner. We\'re all mixed up in this thing. Users far outnumber miners at this point. I see the tides turning: Miners will be at the mercy of users choosing to transact on their chain.... Miners will become scared to deviate for fear of getting on the wrong chain with worthless bitcoins.\n\nAnother thing that isn\'t talked about enough is WHAT IF  the 2 forks both had enough following that we end up having 2 chains *forever* or even more than 2? Hmmmm, possible. Why not? This has been explored here...Very thoughtful analysis: http://thebitcoinnews.com/2013/06/06/go-fork-yourself-life-after-a-bitcoin-hard-fork/ (images are not displaying)\n\nOf course, this is all speculation until we have a real fork and the shit hits the fan...

I began mining back when few people (even within the tech circles) had ever heard of Bitcoin. Nearly all of my current wealth was made from mining bitcoins, mostly from back when I started. I started mining back when mining on a CPU was possible, and soon started mining on a decent ATI GPU, which could mine about 0.4 BTC per day. Back then, that was worth less than a dollar (today it's nearly $120), but it was still exciting, so I saved those bitcoins and kept mining just because it was fun to see my computer printing money, however small it was. \n\nIf I pull out even 10% of my bitcoins and put it in the bank, my bank is going to contact me for lots of questioning. They once called me up asking about the weird wire transfers from Slovakia (from Bitstamp) and I tried to explain that they were from a Bitcoin exchange, and they'd never heard of Bitcoin before, and they kept asking if it had to do with anything illegal. Now I just trade large chunks in person for cash and spend that. I have a few thousand in the bank for if I ever need dollars right away, and I put chunks of a few hundred in the bank every month or so to pay for my car insurance and college tuition. That's really all I use my bank for, and I only use it because my insurance company and college don't accept cash (or bitcoins, yet!). \n\nIf I lose it all, then that really sucks. But, financially, I'll be back where I was five years ago, but a few thousand dollars richer (from what I currently have stored in the bank). And I'll still leave with a great story and a lot of lessons learned, and much more technical knowledge (I learned how to build computers, and learned lots of programming and networking skills, which are useful for someone majoring in computer science), and I'll have a lot more knowledge about economics (I've learned more about economics from trading bitcoins than I did from my high school econ class, except for diversification; I guess I was sick that day!).

It's incredibly unlikely to happen.  Luke-jr has a list of addresses he bans mining transactions for in his bitcoin build, at the end of the day it's a true democracy with mining so people are free to do as they please.  Most miners however don't ban things like Satoshi Dice so this banning merely slows down the average transaction time from these wallets, it doesn't stop them.\n\nIt only takes 1 miner who accepts them to transfer the funds to a new address to break the ban therefore this approach is not practical to work, especially for small thefts like $5m.\n\n\nThe other approach is for merchants to check the tainted percentage of funds before accepting them.  Given these stolen funds can be mixed with legitimate funds you'd need a threshold of how clean the money is to accept it.\nAgain this would only slow things down as over time they will become more diluted throughout the network making this approach infeasible too.\n\n\nBest bet is use good old fashion policing to work the electronic trail of transactions and eventually nab whoever is spending them when they slip up by doing something daft like using localbitcoins to trade some.": 7, 'But could the protocol itself contain the functionality for freezing the coins.

Yes the exchange would still have lost the coins BUT the thief wouldn't have them either so there is less incentive to steal large funds like this.\n\n\nThis may cause some trust concerns with the main pools colluding like this so the other approach is the biggest pool operator actually turns off all their hardware (KnC I'm looking at you ;)).  This will cause the hash rate to drop.  They keep all this hardware turned off but keep ramping up the powered off hardware to ensure they have 51% of the network power at a moments notice.\n\n\nNow when a scenario like this pops up they offer to turn on all their mining equipment to rewrite the block chain in exchange for half the funds + running costs required to rewrite the chain (i.e. the faster they're alerted to rewriting it the cheaper it is).\nExchanges could fund this sleeping mining operation to cover it's costs when idle.\n\n\nIt would make it only worthwhile using this service for large sums of money, $5m is borderline at a guess.\n": 0, "It's possible, but you'd need cooperation from everyone.\n\nPeople wouldn't cooperate because that's a bad precedent, how do we even know they were stolen, just because Bitstamp said so?\n\nWhat would be interesting is if Bitstamp announced a bounty on information leading to the arrest of the thief.

I see about $5 go to multiple addresses, $400 to another and $300 to another.\n\nMaybe I can guess $400 is the iPhone itself and $300 the Apple markup. Particularly if that address was used when I bought something on iTunes.\n\nMaybe enough people can work out together who is receiving $400. \nSomeone somewhere will maybe find a way to cut the middleman out of it.\n\nYes it's better for the market overall, but this is worse for Apple - the guys who have to actually implement it.\n\nAnd maybe Apple isn't a great example because they'll have a ton of legal protections and contracts, so let's not get distracted by those details. It could be a lemonade stand. Or a car parts reseller.\n\nAnyway, the people who are having their debts paid off efficiently, have work to do to implement it and no benefit, with potential financial privacy risks.\n\nWhat would I as Apple, a lemonade stand, or a car parts reseller have to gain from implementing a complex payment strategy?": 3, '> If you buy a phone from Apple as in your example, the money from that transaction isn\'t split.\n\nBefore I reached this comment, I was actually considering how splitting the "end points" of the payment could be a big advantage, in order to address the privacy concerns being raised. If supplier X will receive $400 from a transaction, why **not** have the option to send that as $38 to one address, $167 to another, $131 to yet another, and $196 to another? I suppose that if using relayed signed payment requests (from the supplier, bundled with the merchant\'s own signed payment request), the destination totals would be revealed anyway, but perhaps the suppliers\' payment requests don\'t need to be a part of what the customer sees (and in fact, implementing that, at least securely, would require the supplier(s) AND the merchant to participate in the process simultaneously at checkout, which is not the business that suppliers are in).\n\nSo in that way, it works a bit like a coin mixing service, or at least it conceals the things that are being paid for a little better. Just intuitively, it seems like having the option to split outputs is a good thing (more freedom, more better!), and I don\'t see any reason not to do it. Furthermore, it\'s very unlikely that the amount to settle between merchant and supplier will be an exact multiple of the merchant\'s retail prices, so at some point that cost will need to be fractioned no matter what, but with "1 payment, 1 receiving address" it means that the merchant will have to settle these "rounding" amounts out of their own balance, which further complicates the matter. I think being able to split the outputs is a very, very good thing - I\'m curious why you have concerns about it.': 1, "No, that's not how it works at all. There is no relationship between what was ordered and where the payment goes. I could be ordering alpaca socks and the supplier of wool socks is actually receiving the money. This system doesn't expose anything about markups or even who the customer is up the chain. All the supplier sees is: merchant X just paid off $Y of his credit. \n\nThe incentive to do this is quite obvious: moving money costs both time and money. Reducing the number of movements (and therefore the required time and fees) is beneficial to every one involved.\n\nThings become so much simpler when there are no middle men.": 3, 'Tldr so the consumer pays for a product and the payment is automaticly spread out to the supliers of the merchant?': 6, "nice idea, it'd be nice to use bitcoin trezor for http://satoshilabs.com/news/2015-01-13-trezor-firmware-1-3-0-update-multisig/ - and use armory since it works with trezor": 1, 'Fascinating!

Or decide to let customers pay directly at that one grumpy supplier. Or only keep the small, or the large payments for himself.\n\nOr change the routing of all of this every other day again. \n\nThrow in hotwallets, coldwallets, multisig, paymentprocessors and automatic conversion into the mix for good measure.\n\nThink "electricity grid" for money! Consume electricity from the grid, or power up those photovoltaic panels, or react on the electricity prices, all fully automated.\n\nThis stuff really is miles and miles away from stone-age-banktransfers.': 6, 'Tl;dr: intelligent routing of payments instead of receiving + re-sending.': 5, "The above description is just a rough sketch of what could be built and it covers just the low hanging fruit.

You'd nope right out of there, right? With Bitcoin we can do exactly that and users would be none the wiser. \n\n\nEven end users could make use of a payment router some day. They'd probably not run it themselves (we probably would, but not the masses), and would just use some online service. You'd be able to enter your mortgage or rent, your phone bill, utility bill, car payments, your own wallet, savings, kids allowance, etc and have your salary sent to that router. Everything would be routed automatically, and maybe you'd even be able to prioritize which outputs must be filled first, etc. \n\nEndless possibilities. :)": 2, "The suppliers don't have to analyze any transactions to figure out what the markup is.

That's why there are suppliers and merchants in the first place. This is all irrelevant to the discussion.\n\nRegardless,\n\nIf you buy a phone from Apple as in your example, the money from that transaction isn't split. The whole amount is sent on to either *1* supplier or *1* employee or into the companies own profit account, etc. The idea is to look at the bigger picture. Apple is going to sell more than one phone. The next payment is going to be routed differently. ": 5, "That would depend on BIP70.

You might as well wait until there is a good amount of BTC to steal.\n\nThe best course of action would be to wait for a bunch of BTC to be deposited at Bitstamp and then execute the attack.

You can imagine it as a sort of word processor for finance, so it doesn't have a browsable gallery of projects in it.\n\nHowever by itself this is a bit useless, as you really are interested in funding actual projects and other things (e.g. group buys for a conference or concert). So the idea is, anyone who wants to can set up a project gallery website that builds a community and has a collection of projects. These gallery sites could be very fancy with videos, news, etc, or something as simple as a forum. They can compete with each other in the market, without having to worry about the mechanics of moving money. \n\nI've built one for Bitcoin and cryptography related projects which will launch at the same time as Lighthouse Beta. It's not got open signups though - this gallery is just for projects that my company has vetted, believes are implementable, and is willing to take on. People can express interest just via the web without pledging real bitcoins, as a form of market research. If there's too many funded projects for me to realistically take on, that'd be amazing and at that point I'd look for subcontractors who I trust and believe can do a quality job.\n\nHowever if someone disagrees with this approach, and wants to fund protocol stuff in a different way, they can certainly organise their own set of crowdfunds with other developers delivering them! All you need is HTML and ability to gather a community.\n\nI hope that makes sense. It's a bit more complicated than a vertically integrated system like Kickstarter where one company does everything, but by unbundling the management of the bitcoins from community/marketing/vetting side I hope to see competition create really fantastic gallery sites, and other projects won't need the overhead of a gallery at all.": 11, "Let's ask the core devs if they can set a day to release testnet 4.\nIt should be easy to acquire testnet coins if we don't want people to use real Bitcoins when testing out projects.": 1, "So for those of us who want the protocol to really start to evolve, the only way to do that will be to donate to Mike's company, which basically just pays him.

That is what banks do. \n\nAs for your other point what you don\'t seem to understand is the fundamental difference between bitcoin and fiat. Bitcoin is bitcoin, it is an asset not a debt. You can tell the difference trivially between a bitcoin and a bitcoin debt (one is on the blockchain and one isn\'t). Fiat is debt. There is no way to distinguish between a dollar and a dollar debt, they are the same thing. Because money is now debt and it\'s what everyone is used to  few people even understand this point as your comment shows. With fiat banks create more debt money and it goes right into circulation (it is money creation) and there is no way to know what is an asset and what is a debt because it\'s all debt (and it constantly expands). With bitcoin banks can\'t do that. You either have a bitcoin or you have a bitcoin debt. The two are not the same.

This also represents supply-side inflation: since "a dollar" gets less unique and rare every time more of it is created, each dollar you *hold* grows less valuable since there are now more places to get dollars from besides from you.\n\n> and isn\'t this inevitable? / Isn\'t this going to happen to bitcoin?\n\nI don\'t see why. The only reason why it happens with Fiat is because Fiat represents a counter system controlled by a centralized organization who can and does selfishly profit from supply-manipulation. Bitcoin\'s supply cannot be manipulated, it is strictly controlled and prescribed by the mining algorithm.\n\nAs others have mentioned, when you borrow a dollar from a bank you have a brand new dollar that never existed before. You can withdraw that out of the bank, transfer it to a different bank, get a pretty green piece of paper that basically represents a small bearer\'s bond, and trade that to any bank who never even has to question it\'s pedigree outside of potential counterfeiting. If the world wants to withdraw 10x as many green bits of paper this year than last year, then the government will empty it\'s stockpiles of that document and print 10x as many for next year, just in case.\n\nOn the other hand, when you withdraw one BTC from a Bitcoin Institution, they have to get ahold of one unique Bitcoin (eg, 1e8 unforgeable satoshis) to transmit to you: probably out of their reserves. If they run full reserve this isn\'t so hard, because every BTC deposited sits there authentically waiting to be withdrawn again. But if they run fractional reserve then they risk a bank run whenever enough people decide to withdraw at once.\n\nHere is another fascinating example to consider, though. The gold market *does* act a lot like fiat currency today because gold "ownership" is traded at fractional reserve far more frequently than anybody actually carts around and authenticates actual piles of gold bars.\n\nBitcoin is far more resistant to this fate because of how much easier it is to transport, store, and authenticate than gold. At the end of the day, it\'s basically no harder to accept a raw Bitcoin than it is to accept a bitcoin IOU, so money receivers will almost *never* accept the IOU (with it\'s risk of falling flat should the issuer welsh on their promise) in lieu of a complete Bitcoin whose value comes not from anybody\'s promise but from it\'s own transactional utility and rarity. :3': 1, 'Regardless of how valuable the tokens grow or ebb to each villager, if the knight gives them ten and comes back asking for eleven they still don\'t exist.\n\nIn OP\'s example the knight did not hand them 10 tokens, see that one token is worth a carrot and then announce "I want 11 carrots worth of tokens on my return".

If bitcoin is lent to someone, it is a debt, but I could lend a real bitcoin from the blockchain to that person. In that situation real money is also debt. Money = debt? :) Do you get it?\n\nSo again, the real difference between Bitcoin and fiat is that bitcoin can't be manipulated. Everyone has an equal chance and there is no corruptable entity that can print money and transfer wealth from the holders of the money to themselves.\n": 1, ">He wins, and someone always loses.\n\n*Only if they make the same mistake* of thinking that tokens are static in value over time.

However, this is not a necessary property of money or currency or contracts concerning them.": 0, '> Isn\'t the m1 moneybase NOT debt?\n\nWith fiat money, all money has its mirror of debt. This is for the simple reason that fiat money is really nothing more than the balance sheet inside banks, including central banks, so that for every asset there must be a corresponding liability until they net to zero. When a loan is made the bank simultaneously adds the liability in the amount they lent, and adds the asset of debt which is the amount owed to them to their balance sheets.\n\nThe moneybase simply represents the money that is held inside the central banks. This money is also lent into existence, meaning it comes with its corresponding debt. The central banks lend the money, essentially interest free, to their respective governments. (I say "interest free" because all interest paid from government bonds held by the central banks are returned to the government.) What this means, then, is that the government is ultimately who creates money in a fiat system, and they do that by increasing the amount of debt. So, for example, when the US government debates raising the debt ceiling, what they are really debating is whether they should create more money (out of thin air). Every government on the planet (minus a few tiny ones no one has ever heard of) are in debt. Government debt in a fiat system doesn\'t really mean that the government owes money, ultimately it means that it has created it, and it can create as much money as it wants because it owns the currency.\n\n> Isn\'t the monetary base expanded by loans and isn\'t this inevitable?\n\nYes. Banks don\'t actually have to have the money they lend. Having the money prior to making a loan is more or less irrelevant actually, since it is just the trivial measure of typing in the amount of money to the debtor\'s account. Then adding the amount owed to the banks balance sheet. They don\'t actually have to have any money to keep the sheet balanced. \n\n> Isn\'t this going to happen to bitcoin?\n\nThink of bitcoin more like gold. As much as alchemists in the middle ages tried, you can\'t just create gold out of thin air, therefore you cannot lend gold into existence, you can only lend paper substitutes that are redeemable for gold into existence. There may end up being second tier representations for bitcoin, in the same way paper money came to represent gold, but no one has the ability to create bitcoins simply on a whim. \n\n> Isn\'t the only difference that central banks can print money and manipulate interest rates and they can\'t do it with bitcoin?\n\nThat is a very big difference (and definitely not the only one).\n\n> Is debt as money not bad per se but isn \'t it just that the balance is gone: Cheap credit, central bank manipulation.\n\nWhen a bank creates a loan it simultaneously creates money and debt. The problem is that the debt is simultaneously a "real" thing just as the money is and is valuable in its own right. People buy and sell debt all the time. So the bank creates a loan, and now new money is circulating in the system, but they immediately go and sell the debt from that loan to someone else, creating a system in which they are guaranteed to make money by issuing loans. So the system essentially incentivizes fraud and deceit. Debt spirals out of control, and most of the money out there is being created by debts that are likely never going to be paid. It is a disaster waiting to happen, as we already saw in 2008. The entire system is based on trust, and there is very little about Wallstreet that is trustworthy. Thus insane amounts of government regulations, bureaucracy, and laws are required just to keep the system from falling apart . . . it doesn\'t just run on its own, it has to be propped up with a great deal of effort. \n\n ': 1, 'Yes and No.\n\nIn the short term, it is somewhat true. For every dollar created by the federal reserve and "loaned" to the US government or member banks, there is a percentage of debt attached. So for example if the fed creates $100 and loans it to the US government, it expects to get paid $105 when the loan matures. In order to pay back this loan, the US government will have to take out a second loan to pay the first. Thus, a perpetual debt situation seems to be occurring.\n\n**HOWEVER** what most people tend to miss in this situation, including our friend in this video, is that when the loan is paid back to the federal reserve, the interest paid on the loan is recirculated back into the economy, thus keeping the money supply even and balanced with the outstanding loans. All interest paid to the fed is deposited into the US treasury, and recirculated from there. In essence, when the US government pays the federal reserve interest, it is paying itself.\n\n**FURTHER**, when that interest is recirculated back into the economy, it can be re-taxed by the US government as income and used **again** to pay down debt, and this process can repeat indefinitely. A single dollar bill can pay down 100 times it\'s value in debt if it is recirculated and re-taxed enough times.\n\nSo, like I said, yes and no.': 3, 'Hand out 10 tokens to 10 people with 1% annual interest.

The other party has some sort of note that represents a bitcoin debt and that is obviously not a bitcoin as it isn\'t on the blockchain and cannot be spent like a bitcoin nor can it be loaned out again.  In the fiat banking system people deposit dollars and those dollars are lent out while the original depositors still think they have their dollars.  There is no distinction between the original deposited dollar and and lent out dollar, they are all debt.  After the loan there are now two dollars where before there was only one--you have one and the guy your dollar was lent to has one.  And the newly created one can be deposited and loaned out again!  [That\'s not quite accurate as there are issues with reserve ratios, etc. but that gives a basic idea of where more fiat money comes from].  And in reality banks don\'t even need to have the deposits to loan out first, they just create money to loan out at the time of the loan and find enough "deposits" of some sort later to fulfill their reserve requirements (and those requirements have been dropping over the years).': 5, "That's an example where each token is worth less.

It's never really hurt much I suppose. Forecast says it should blow over.": 1, 'OK, let me play devil\'s advocate here.\n\n1. No inflation. This is a lie. Currently the money supply of bitcoins is inflated at about 10% annually due to mining. Few mainstream fiat currencies are *that* bad. They usually restrain themselves to about 5-8% annual money supply inflation. Yes, inflation in Bitcoin is decreasing exponentially and will eventually disappear 140 years from now - but by then we all will be dead so it doesn\'t really concern us right now.\n\n2. Decentralization (No Government, banks needed). While true, is this really an universal advantage? Centralization means that one professional entity is in charge of the currency. Decentralization means that millions of random yahoos are supposed to be "their own bank", which results in scores of "my wallet was stolen" and "exchange X was hacked" stories. It also means no insurance and no customer protection. Surely these can be considered at least minor inconveniences sometimes?\n\n3. Fast and easy. Fast - maybe. Easy - gimme a break.\n\n4. No/few transaction fees - only as long as miners are sufficiently rewarded. Once the block reward (and/or the price of BTC) drops sufficiently, miners will start requiring significantly larger fees in order to do their job - or they will stop doing it at all, grinding the system to a halt.\n\n5. Store of purchasing power (just 21 million coins). Actually, their number is lower, because some are irreversibly lost and some will be uneconomical to mine. However, purchasing power is not determined by the number of units alone. I might own a snowflake that is unique, in the sense that there no other in the world like it, yet its purchasing power is zero. Plus, a *store* of purchasing power is something that keeps a relatively *constant* purchasing power. If the purchasing power of something fluctuates +1000% in one year and -60% the next, that\'s no "store" of value, no matter how much speculative profits you managed to make off it.\n\n6. Secure from government sanctions. Yeah, right. Which country will be banning Bitcoin this week? \'Coz I already lost track of those that already have.\n\n7. Money for the people (No fees, interest and activity charge). I am not interested in money for the "people". I am interested in money for the markets. The whole concept of money was invented so that people could trade more easily, not as some sort of socialist do-gooding. I already addressed the "no fees" and "activity charge" issue above. And no interest is actually a flaw. By lending money, I am taking risk that whoever borrows them will not be able or willing to repay them back. For taking such a risk, I expect to be rewarded with interest, proportional to that risk. If am not going to be rewarded, I am not going to risk my money - i.e., I won\'t invest them.\n\n8. It\'s the future. I respectfully refuse to believe that your crystal ball works better than mine or anyone else\'s.\n\n9. Money of the Internet.

The hypothesis-experiment-confirmation-or-rejection method works only with exact sciences. It doesn\'t work with social sciences. *Other* methods are used there.

(We can\'t reproduce the Great Depression with one condition changed in order to verify our hypothesis of what caused it.) You construct a theory that is sound and explains the human interactions in the society. Then, based on that theory, you explain the observed future interactions. If your theory is sound, it will have significant, albeit imprecise, predictive power.\n\nFor instance, Austrian economic theory suggests that inflation (increasing the money supply) leads to the distortion of the economic signals, resulting in malinvestments. As a result, wealth is transferred from those who get the new "money" last to those who get them first. Also, capital is consumed (destroyed) and eventually this results in an economic bust. Note that I didn\'t say anything about price increases. *Some* prices may increase more than reasonable (because malinvestment results in increased demand for goods and services that are otherwise not economically profitable) but you cannot predict in advance which prices will increase, by how much and when. This is why I said that although the theory has predictive power, is not as precise as that of the exact sciences.\n\nAnd, of course, the social sciences are full of bogus theories.

That was my only point. Given the whole libertarian origin story of bitcoin, it's pretty clear that Satoshi et al. would agree that there is inflation, since that's how the currency is designed *using their definitions of inflation*. \n\nhttp://wiki.mises.org/wiki/Inflation\n\n": 1, 'I have no problem with sound money as a store of value - and, indeed, gold and silver have been that for centuries.

It wasn\'t common in von Mises\' days and, in fact, he was witnessing this hijacking process and published a sharp critique of it.\n\nThe *proper* meaning of "inflation" is "increase of the money supply relative to the supply of goods and services". Price increases (what they call "price inflation") is just one unreliable *symptom* of inflation (unreliable in the sense that it doesn\'t always happen and you cannot predict in advance when prices will increase, by how much and the prices of which products will increase).': 1, 'http://i2.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/010/692/19789999.jpg': 1, 'Wow you chose the third option and at the same time you showed you are stupid.

We already know what happens with centralized systems. Decentralization is not an advantage, it is just the only option.\n\nIndeed, centralized systems require trust in the central entity. Ask yourself - as a whole, does the humanity trust the central financial institutions that have had centuries to establish themselves, or does it trust more a bunch of yahoos with PCs?\n\nJust because a payment method allows us to transfer value without trusting any particular third party (which is indeed a revolutionary invention), does not mean that a Bitcoin-based economy does not require trust in centralized entities. And with the current state of affairs, this trust is often misplaced. Mt. Gox. Bitstamp, countless of other minor exchanges that have failed, have suspended accounts, or are spying on your purchases. Not to mention the many individuals that have been individually scammed by other individuals while trading with them via Localbitcoins. Unless, of course, they haven\'t been scammed (yet) because they have opted to put their trust in a centralized entity, like Localbitcoins\' escrow system.\n\nMaybe things will improve in the future. I sincerely hope that they do, because the current state of scams is simply intolerable and keeps the average person away from this technology.\n\n> Email used to be extremely complicated in 1980, now it\'s extremely easy for anyone to use email. Give Bitcoin wallets time.\n\nFair enough. Please change "fast and easy" to "fast and horribly cumbersome but expected to become easier at some undetermined point of time in the future, when enough apps and infrastructure have been developed" and you\'ll get no objection from me.\n\n> That is not how it Works. Miners compete for the fees people are willing to give. In perfect equilibrium all the fees are spent securing the network. The fees will be the m\xc3\xadnimum fees enough to secure the network.\n\nI don\'t think that you understand how economics works. In a free market rational people act in a way they expect to profit them. Mining requires capital expense for hardware and electricity - significant one, too. Nobody in their right mind would do it without expecting to profit from it. Therefore, the price of the block reward plus the fees from the processed transactions must be greater than the costs of the operation - otherwise people simply will not do it. It is not possible to determine how much the fees will be at any particular point of time, because we cannot predict the price reliably, but *if* the block reward and/or the price of bitcoins drop *significantly*, miners will stop mining *unless* people start paying large enough fees to make the business of the miners profitable (or the miners can get access to much more cost-efficient hardware and cheaper energy sources).\n\n> This is just a matter of market capitalization. When the market becomes deeper, changes will be much smaller.\n\nThat\'s another economically ignorant statement. Price volatility does not depend on market cap. It depends, to some significant degree, on market liquidity (i.e., the number of buyers and sellers) but it is by far not the only factor. I\'ve seen credible research demonstrating that price volatility is an inherent property of Bitcoin but it\'s too lengthy to explain here. In any case, increasing the market cap (which basically means increasing the price, since the number of units has an upper bound) won\'t solve the problem.\n\n> At least it\'s not the past.

All data of the memory\nblock is encrypted, RAM and ROM are equipped with an error detection code (EDC) and the\nInfineon\xc2\xae SOLID FLASH\xe2\x84\xa2 is equipped in addition with an error correction code (ECC).\nThe memories are connected to the Core with the AXITM Memory Bus and the peripherals are\nconnected with the APBTM Peripheral Bus.\n\n\n[See more about the general features of the hardware chip here](http://www.infineon.com/dgdl/SOLID+FLASH+SLE+97+Family_PB.pdf?folderId=db3a3043341f67a101343be2a35d1f46&fileId=db3a30433917ea3301392ec288fc4ff0) or if you'd like to read more of the technical details in the Common Criteria validation paper (EDIT) [you can get it here.] (https://www.commoncriteriaportal.org/files/epfiles/0827V2b_pdf.pdf)": 2, "How safe is the platform?\n\nI wouldn't mind getting more detail about this....": 2, "Hi there, thank you for your feedback! We understand our product is not for everyone, but we're committed to making Bitcoin easier to use and with very high security standards.\n\nIn the interest of transparency, we use Infineon's Smart Card IC SLE97 libraries with a Crypto2304T Asymmetric Cryptographic Processor.\n\nWe utilize a Common Criteria EAL 5+ certified chip (Secure Element) to protect the private keys from hacker probing. By using this chip we can not open the firmware to the public.\n\nWe as the (Secure Element developer) needed to sign Non Disclosure Agreements with the chip vendor to obtain the development environment and confidential documents.
