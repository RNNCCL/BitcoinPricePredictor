I also got positive feedback from people who actually used it.\n\nI would agree with people who says that Skyhook is only $999, which is 2.5 times cheaper option. Yes, Skyhook machine is cheap and very nice and basic. I mean, I like the skyhook project a lot. They give a huge value to the market, as almost everybody can purchase and install their machine now. Look, they overpassed Robocoin, and now have 50 installations worldwide. But on the other hand, Skyhook due to it's basic set-up doesn't have some useful features.\n\nThere are many things marked in the [blog post](http://coinatmradar.com/blog/general-bytes-bitcoin-atm-review/) regarding PROs of General Bytes, I would like to mention several here:\n\n* has **POS** integrated by default, so you can run a restaurant and install this unit and you have two products in one: ATM and POS terminal. It even supports tipping to employees.\n\n* **remote management** For example, this feature is missing in Skyhook, and you need to visit the machine every time you want to change the settings (to my knowledge), however in GB you can do this remotely, sitting at home.\n\n* **multicurrency** (fiat, crypto) support. Again, skyhook is open source, but you need to develop it yourself, however here it is supported out-of-the-box.\n\n* **KYC/AML**. Many people say you cannot do KYC based on fingerprint, in anyway this is supported and I find a nice feature. Also you can scan the docs, you can verify customer by phone and depending on this set flexible limits of transactions. In Lamassu for example there were no verification features supported until recently when the collaboration with IdentityMind was announced. However, it is still not clear what kind of checks will be supported. Because of the lack of this functionality, e.g. [QwikBit developed their own verification procedure](http://coinatmradar.com/bitcoin_atm/193/bitcoin-atm-lamassu-douglas-thirsty-pigeon/), thanks to open-source code of Lamassu. However, using GB you can be compliant in many places using default settings and not needing to develop anything custom. \n\n* it has a lot of **integrated wallets** and exchanges, e.g. recently they integrated and now support Coinkite wallet.\n\n* The machine has a lot of small features, e.g. you can buy bitcoins using your email only, so that created private key is encrypted and sent to you. I don't know any other ATM with such feature.\n\nRegarding CONs, I don't find many:\n\n* one thing, and this is what I mentioned to Karel (owner) already, is that it would be nicer to have 10'' screen instead of 7''. I think Lamassu machine is much user-friendly now after they moved to bigger screen (10'')\n\n* another drawback, maybe the price can not be easily accepted by random enthusiast, however as I said the functionality-wise you can not compare it to Skyhook, I would rather compare it to Lamassu, which is about the same size and costs $6500.

In this regard it \nshould be kept in mind that the U.S. Constitution \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\xa6has nothing to say about private \nparties creating money,\xe2\x80\x9d to quote a legal expert (Grinberg, Hastings Science and \nTechnology Law Journal, 2011). Thus Articles 8 and 10 of Part I specify that \xe2\x80\x9cCongress \nhas the power to coin money, regulate the value thereof, and of foreign coin, and fix the \nStandard of Weights and measures\xe2\x80\x9d while \xe2\x80\x9cNo state shall \xe2\x80\xa6 make any thing but gold \nand silver coin a tender in payment of debts.\xe2\x80\x9d So in fact the Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s provisions \nregarding money evidently specify a gold or silver or bimetallic standard and therefore\nwould appear to be sharply inconsistent with the Federal Reserve\xe2\x80\x99s monetary powers as \npresently recognized. How did this come to pass? The answer is, as many of you will \nknow, that the current situation was enabled as a result of three Supreme Court \ndecisions concerning the Greenbacks from the Civil War, decisions the reasoning of \nwhich seems to be highly illogical, as described in detail by Richard Timberlake in a \nrecent (2013) book (and very briefly in a short paper of mine).

Why, then, is it widely believed that this team\xe2\x80\x94which influences but does not dictate the common beliefs of Bitcoin users,which are central to its coherence\xe2\x80\x94will not turn inflationary? Well, these five individuals are probably large bitcoin holders who would suffer from any reduction in the real value of bitcoins. Anyhow, the relevant point is that the auto-pilot is not fully predetermined as of now.\n\nAbout the only part about that [edit: paragraph that] he got right is that a change that devalues coins would not be popular.\n\nSuch a change that alters the rate of issuance would require a hard fork of the Bitcoin protocol.   The economic majority (those who buy the coins from the miners) would likely not be onboard with such a change and thus the miners would not implement the fork.

I\'ve written about the netvend project here before. The social application of netvend yields a system which I\'ve begun to call a **"pulsenet": a network of voluntary tips viewed as individualized upvotes.**\n\nPart of netvend\'s structure is that it offers a **pulse** command to any client, which is essentially a financial payment that costs less than a Satoshi to send, and which can handle ultra-small values. A **pulsenet** is the history of voluntary tips among users on a secure, transparent, ultra-low-friction, irreversible payment system. **By analyzing this pulsenet, clients can follow real value through the network to find good content.** The pulsenet would look different from user to user, because the pulsenet is defined primarily by the *user\'s* pulsing habits.\n\nOn a system that functions like this, users will find that **a pulse is both a financial tip and a sincere upvote**, perhaps only a few millisatoshis, that nevertheless can pile up for good content creators. Each pulse would add definition to a user\'s (and the network\'s) pulsenet, and each client can mine the pulsenet in any way the developer can think up.\n\nWe\'re seeing a new culture emerge with this tipping mechanic. Netvend is designed as the convergence of many recent trends, and the social network application relies heavily on the same thing that\'s got everyone.\n\nIn the wake of all this changetip buzz, I\'m working to have a concise, updated description of the social application of netvend within the next couple of days.

This means that transactions are fully public, but identities are not.\n\n>So, the all the addresses have been connected to each other and also been connected to me, thus breaking my anonymity.\n\nYes, in the sense that the chains of ownership for three different coins have been linked together.\n\nIf your identity becomes linked to any one of the three addresses, it could also be linked to the other two by deduction.\n\nThe terms you\'ll want to search are "multi-input transaction" and "multiple input transaction", together with "privacy" (not "anonymity").\n\nThat said, this is a significant privacy issue in Bitcoin\n\nHere\'s a bit more about the problem:\n\nhttps://medium.com/@octskyward/merge-avoidance-7f95a386692f\n\nhttp://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~smeiklejohn/files/imc13.pdf\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZduzDJTg9Y\n\n>What am i missing out here?\n\nThat inputs are signed *independently* of one another. In other words, you and I can separately sign the inputs of a transaction, but nobody knows we\'re both participating. It looks like a single person (if you don\'t understand how transactions work).\n\nThis principle has led to CoinJoin:\n\nhttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=279249.0\n\nWhich has been followed with a trustless way to do CoinJoin, CoinShuffle:\n\nhttp://crypsys.mmci.uni-saarland.de/projects/CoinShuffle/coinshuffle.pdf\n\nThe emergence of these mixing schemes makes it increasingly problematic to assume that all inputs in a multi-input transaction belong to the same users, as Sarah Meiklejohn notes in the linked video above.': 5, "An exchange, etc can match you up if they have your identity, anyone else can't": 2, 'If it is pseudonymous, then please answer [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/2lh3ai/bitcoin_core_transaction_confusion/clupbri) \\^_^': 1, "The real public key isn't broadcast until the first transaction so it's protected against any attacks on ecdsa, that's all I know": 1, "There is another mechanism that makes it less clear who owns what money. When multiple users use a bitcoin tumbler, or jointly pay a single person,  it looks the same as if one person with multiple wallets did the transaction.\n\nThat said,  the bitcoin protocol is pseudonymous, not anonymous,  for both transactions and ownership. If you look at the proposal for safecoin, which uses kademlia instead of a blockchain, you can find a better ownership anonymity protocol,  and darkcoin has a better level of transaction anonymity.\n\nRemember,  bitcoin was the first blockchain based digital currency;  saying that there are details that could be improved is very reasonable. If needed,  many of these ideas can even be incorporated into the bitcoin protocol,  with a hard split.  (It's unlikely to occur unless the improvement is huge and necessary.)": 2, "But i'm not talking about breaking into a wallet or anything. When i create new addresses, i do it because i don't want other user(s) to know my other sources of transactions. But when multiple address are shown up in one transaction, that means *ALL* of those addresses are of the same user, which reveals the other transactions carried out by me. **THAT** breaks anonymity. Doesn't it?": 1, 'eventually, I imagine it will be transparent for your wallet to request additional addresses from the vendor, one for each unspent output.': 2, 'Bitcoin never was/and is not Anonymous. It never guarantees nor provides for anonymity in any form in the core protocol.\n\nBitcoin is pseudonymous as you are using generated addresses rather than real world names/aliases.\n\nTo anonymise your transactions you would need to use some form of mixing service, or dark-wallet system - or alternative coin such as Monero': 1, "Creating new addresses is mainly about security in not re-using a private key where the public key has become truly public.\n\n\nRegarding anonymity, the history of balances can always be traced back (it's how you verify the funds aren't just created out of thin air).  That said for each transaction it becomes more diluted so harder to be sure who actually spent the coins which is the point.\n\n\nYour point about all the source transactions must be under control of the owner is a good one and yes it does link them if you're 100% sure you know the sender of that transaction.\nYou could pay the fee and get all the transactions consolidated into one address to avoid this or go via a hot wallet/coin mixing service to make this analysis impossible to the public.\n\n\n": 2, 'What does pseudonymous even mean?

I don't know how many of these people are going to stick around, but it's quite clear that tippers are generating a lot of buzz. \n\nHowever, it's generating some negative sentiment too. Somebody did some drive-by copy/paste tipping in /r/BitcoinMarkets' daily thread, and it was not received well because it really mucks up the thread and offers nothing of value to the discussion. That's why we need to be very mindful of where we're tipping and how much. In a thread dedicated to being a giveaway, go nuts! But it's really not proper etiquette in other threads or subreddits.\n\n\nHere's some general tipping etiquette to get the most out of your tips. Please encourage others to read this:\n\n* Add the word 'private' to most tips to keep threads tidy.\n* Try to tailor fun [custom monikers](https://www.changetip.com/tip-amounts) to the communities you're tipping in.\n* This isn't just about collecting tips. It's about *giving* tips.\n* Tips of higher value make a much better impression outside of giveaway threads.\n* If somebody clearly does not want to be tipped, do not tip them, even as a joke.\n* Do not engage in drive-by tipping sprees. Instead, share some insight, then leave a tip at the end.\n* Different communities have different minimum tip standards.\n 1. All tip amounts are welcome in /r/ChangeTip, /r/BitTippers, and /r/FreeBits. Go subscribe!\n 2. In /r/Bitcoin, we need to aim for *at least* 100 bits, but preferably $.25 or $1.00, or even more.\n 3. When tipping anywhere else on reddit, I cannot stress enough how important it is to tip *at least* $1.00, because any less will almost always leave a bad impression since they're most likely not accustomed to microtransactions. If you're not sure how it will be perceived, you can always ask first, and/or use the 'private' function.": 16, "/u/changetip, be a good bot and run over to give /u/Pooper85 1000 bits for me. private\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/2lgiw2/willing_to_bet_1000_bits/\n\n\n*edit: maybe 'private' didn't work here because I typed it after the period, or too far away from the changetip mention.
