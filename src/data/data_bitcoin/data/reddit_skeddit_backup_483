If you want cash from your PayPal balance there *might* be ways to get it fairly quickly, but then there will be fees and limits. If you want cash with no fees at all, you must withdraw to your US bank account via ACH transfer, which then introduces the delays of the US banking system. It will often be 3 to 5 business days before you can withdraw your transferred PayPal balance as cash. However, PayPal does provide credit-type services as well as funds transfer, so within their own system they can and do blend the two to help cover up for US banking delays. So if you don\'t need cash, you may be able to send some or all of your PayPal balance on to the PayPal accounts other friends and family immediately, but they\'ll then have the same limitations and/or fees should they need cash. You can also likely spend your PayPal balance immediately, though not as widely as credit cards (unless you also qualify for/have their associated debit card). It may also interest you to know that [PayPal is actively working to integrate Bitcoin into their systems and services](http://www.forbes.com/sites/ryanmac/2014/09/23/paypal-takes-small-step-toward-bitcoin-partners-with-cryptocurrency-processors/).  \n\nNow on to Bitcoin, and I\'ll cut to the chase: in total Bitcoin has a lot of advantages over a system like PayPal, but for the average person, concerns about its current drawbacks may outweigh them, especially if you live in the US and already have access to a relatively modern banking system, credit/debit cards, and services like PayPal and Venmo.  \n\nMost people\'s biggest concern about Bitcoin right now is its tremendous volatility, and for good reason. It\'s a very young currency with low liquidity. As a result, it\'s common for its valuation to fluctuate by as much as 10\'s of percent (sometimes in hours or even minutes) relative to mature currencies like the US dollar. In fact, bitcoin is in the midst of a 15 month long bear market, having fallen from its all time high of around $1,140 all the way down to around $180. It\'s currently valued at about $234. To be fair though, some also consider its existing volatility one of its greatest attractions. Skilled day traders (likely a rare and/or short-lived breed) love it, and if you bought around $40 worth of bitcoin five years ago, today it would be worth about $2.34 million. Basically, if you buy and hold bitcoin now, it\'s as if you\'re investing in a very risky high-tech start-up. It could exhibit tremendous growth, but the risk that it could crash and burn may be considerable. If Bitcoin continues to grow, as it matures volatility should gradually fall. In fact, [that trend already seems to be apparent](https://btcvol.info/). I\'ll also mention that merchants can accept payments by bitcoin for much lower (or zero) fees and be completely immune to any volatility risk by using Bitcoin merchant service providers.  \n\nAnother issue is the lack of protections for bitcoin. Since cash has been around for hundreds of years, many protections have been established in the financial services built upon it. These often protect the consumer in the event of loss or fraud. Such protections are so well accepted by society that the need for them is seldom considered. For instance, why is insurance *mandated* for banks? Only because historically, banks failed so often and so spectacularly that public outrage forced the government\'s hand. The costs of these protections are significant and are paid by everyone, whether they need these protections often or if they never use them in their lifetimes. *How* the costs are assessed, however, is well disguised by the industries in question. The fact that these blanket protections exist and that their attendant costs are not obvious to the general public also serves to introduce a [moral hazard](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_hazard) whereby entrenched incumbents (e.g. the credit card industry) can earn higher short-term profit from dragging their feet instead of quickly instituting newer and safer technologies that would end up saving everyone money, but only in the long run. The resulting weak transactional security of existing systems is an area where Bitcoin with its secure "Push" technology is clearly superior.  \n\nAll of the protections of existing financial systems can be created equally well for bitcoin, but at this time few exist. Still, now or in the future, bitcoin offers everyone the ability to perform many of the functions of banks, but without being *required by default* to pay for all of the protections, not to mention the typical banking costs.  \n\nAt it\'s core, Bitcoin is also quite revolutionary. It\'s so new in concept that people normally find it difficult to grasp and use, much like sending email or trying to navigate the Internet was in the early to mid-90\'s. Already services and applications exist so that people can use Bitcoin without a full understanding of all of its intricacies, but today even in these situations it\'s best if the new user has a well-versed guide to introduce them. At this point, to use Bitcoin adeptly, a lot of knowledge needs to be acquired. Bitcoin is a first of its kind digital *thing*, and its owner is fully responsible for securing its possesion. In our everyday lives, we\'re very familiar with *physical* security and how to establish it, but overall, *digital* security is something nearly everybody can learn more about. As a result, casual online use or storage, particularly of large amounts of bitcoin, can result in losses in a multitude of ways. Although Bitcoin the protocol and network have proven very robust, the well-known problems arise at its edges where bitcoin must be owned and secured. Better solutions are developing rapidly, and some good options already exist, yet the day when every Bitcoin beginner can dive in confidently without the chance of suffering a loss has not yet arrived.  \n\nI can never remember all the advantages of Bitcoin at one sitting, so I\'ll defer to a couple of links and videos that give a pretty good account:  \n\nhttp://www.coindesk.com/information/why-use-bitcoin/  \n\nhttp://redd.it/2zfg7e  \n\nAnd the videos:\n\n[The Real Value of Bitcoin (less than 7 minutes)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIVAluSL9SU)  \n\n[World Bitcoin Network - A Million Killer Apps, Part 1 of 3 (26 minutes)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nOfHpOFhN8)\n\nFinally, a devil\'s advocate word on PayPal. Although I think their service is generally fairly good and they seem to be trying to grow and improve, you should be aware that there\'s a vocal community of their customers (past and present) which is less than satisfied (their experiences illustrate PayPal\'s shortcomings):  \n\nhttp://www.paypalsucks.com/  \n\nhttp://www.paypalsucks.com/forums/  \n\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/paypal/top/?sort=top&t=all': 1, '[removed]': -1, '[deleted]': 2, "Thanks for the reply.

Targeting HD wallets rather than private keys directly does not reduce the search space to a more manageable level. It does however *increase* the difficulty of calculating the first key (see: "Type 2 hierarchical deterministic wallet...The seed is used after 100,000 rounds of SHA256 to slow down attacks..." in my link above).\n\nBack to the numbers, unless you have a list of those private keys you have no way of knowing you\'ve searched them. 32 bytes times your million is a somewhat reasonable 32MB/night but to be effective on average in 15 years on one (random) wallet you\'d need to be storing 10^35 bytes (a billion yotta bytes) per second (it goes giga-peta-exa-zetta-yotta) to say nothing of the kind of RAM/DB would be behind your "Enterprise IT" system or how many power stations it would need to operate. You can at least double that as well as you can\'t look up by private key, you\'d need to store the address alongside it.\n': 1, "Don't discount the fact that you can likely eliminate millions of addresses to try each time you find that the first address in the series was never involved in a transaction. This ultimately leads to a significant reduction of the searchable space. No, its not impossible that an address from BitAddress lands squarely in the middle of an HD key sequence. Think of the speed improvements gained by checking to see if the first address in the series was *ever* involved in a transaction. If not, you can eliminate vast numbers of addresses from your search space. If you mate it up with a copy of Bitcoin Core running on the same machine or within your local network, your searches will go MUCH faster than hitting an API.\n\nAFAICT, generating the next keys in the sequence is not that intensive -- think about how quickly Mycelium does it or Electrum in a VM. All of the heavy lifting happens when choosing the 12 words. I do enterprise IT, so when I approach thought problems like these, I'm imagining a blade chassis full of 16 blades each running 4-way 8-core CPUs and 128GB RAM. If I could borrow a setup like that for a night, I'd come back in the morning to a crapload of HD wallets to search in a VM on my laptop, and they would all fit on a USB key. I'm retiring in 15 years. I have a LONG time to find my retirement money hidden in there.\n\nIf you could generate a million HD word lists overnight, how long would it take to scan the first address generated by each list, looking for one whose first address ever participated in a transaction? Think about how many billions of trillions of addresses you could eliminate from your search if the first address in the sequence never participated in a transaction.\n\ntl;dr you only have to generate the first key based on the word list; if it never participated in a transaction, move on and don't bother with the next few million addresses in the sequence": 1, "If you want addresses with money in them just take a look at the blockchain, it's a public ledger.": 1, "Impossible, you can try generating billions of addresses with vanitygen, it's been tried": 1, "Doesn't this video answer your question? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZloHVKk7DHk\n": 1, '> The addresses in no way help you predict what the twelve words to a winning wallet will be. \n\nI think this is the crux of how we\'re approaching it from different directions. You seem to base your points on addresses whereas my focus is on the word lists.\n\n> 32 bytes times your million is a somewhat reasonable 32MB/night\n\nAgain, you\'re focusing on a million single addresses. I\'m thinking a million 12 word lists generated per night. Each one would then be used to generate the first address in the sequence which will then be checked to see if it ever held a balance. If it did, it\'s the leader of what at least one point was an active HD wallet. I\'m not thinking about storing millions of addresses generated by a million word lists per night. I\'m only thinking of storing a million 12 word lists a night. 12 words by average 5 letters by one million or ~~60~~ 71MB a night total. As you traverse the database, you generate the first address for each given word list and check to see if it ever held a balance. If it did, copy the word list to another database . If it did not, move on and check the first address generated by the next word list.\n\nIt appears I\'m taking less of a purist view than you are. I\'m not aiming to hit every single address. I\'m using a non-numeric approach to take the fewest number of shots at the largest part of the field. If most people are using the first generated address in the list, then you\'ll quickly knock out huge swaths of addresses that likely never held a balance. To your earlier point, perhaps check the first 10 or 20 addresses for a random starting point.\n\nI am by no means talking about generating millions of addresses and checking them one at a time. Moving to soft figures, what small actions could yield the greatest number of addresses that are "likely" to hold a balance? Check the first address from a million word lists to see if each one ever held a balance. If it did, the change is likely somewhere down the line. Don\'t bother generating any additional addresses until you get a hit on the first one (hit being it was *ever* used). See the difference in our approach? You seem to go right for the addresses pretty quickly whereas I prefer to figure out which ones are worth calculating before expending the resources to do it.': 1, "> you couldn't COUNT to 2^256\n\nYou don't need to count to 2^256, only to 2^160.

If the HD wallet user started by generating a bunch of receive addresses they will leave empty (recommended) you have to decide how many more to generate and check before ruling out that wallet.\n\nTrue, there's also nothing to stop someone picking one of the HD addresses or another HD wallet crossing it. Very unlikely, obv.\n\nVery unlikely is also a phrase that should be associated with the 2e43 number I mentioned. If 10bn people each had 10bn HD wallets each, each with a satoshi in it, you'd still have to check ~ 5e34 HD wallets before you found one, on average.

L. Weekly Fed. C 243\n\n**Brief Fact Summary**. Stephan Jay Lawrence created and funded an offshore asset protection trust in Mauritius with $7 million dollars. After Lawrence lost a securities law arbitration proceeding, he was punished with a $20.4 million judgment against him. Lawrence filed for bankruptcy and the court ordered him to turn over the bankruptcy trustee assets held in the offshore trust.\n\n**Synopsis of Rule of Law**. Impossibility is not a defense in contempt proceedings where the person charged with contempt is responsible for the inability to comply.\n\n**Facts**. Lawrence created and funded an offshore asset protection trust in Mauritius with $7 million dollars. After Lawrence lost a securities law arbitration proceeding, he was punished with a $20.4 million judgment against him. Lawrence filed for bankruptcy and the court ordered him to turn over the bankruptcy trustee assets held in the offshore trust. Lawrence did not comply and the court held him in contempt and jailed him pending compliance with the turnover order.\n\n\n**Issue**. Whether a person charged with contempt is responsible for his inability to comply with an order to turn over assets in an offshore account if he was removed as a beneficiary under the account because he declared for bankruptcy?\nHeld. Yes. Lawrence is responsible for his inability to comply because even though he was removed as a beneficiary as a result of his bankruptcy filing, he still retained the authority to appoint trustees who could have exercised the authority to reinstate Lawrence as a beneficiary. The new trustees could have distributed the entire trust to Lawrence once he was reinstated. Therefore Lawrence is responsible for his inability to comply. Furthermore, it appears as if the sole purpose of the provision that extinguishes his inters tint the event of bankruptcy is to aid the settlor in evading contempt.\n\n**Discussion**. The court did not accept impossibility as a defense here because settlor still had the power to transfer the assets if he appointed new trustees.': 5, "Too bad that it won't save you from jail": 0, "I have heard this discussed here before but I can't remember what was said": 0, 'shhhhhhhhhhhh!': 6, 'DavinciJ15 was very popular in the silver circles and took alot of shit when he started pumping bitcoin in 2011.

Note that a share of a company is an actual title of property of a slice of the company, not just a token with conventional value.\n\nBitcoin and gold pay no dividends and do not "grow" like a company that builds more factories or a supermarket chain that builds more stored.  Gold still is a concrete asset with is the metal, which has some utilitarian value in decoration and industry, but bitcoin does not even have that; it is just a title to a land plot on Tatooine. (Most people who understand a bit of investment stop caring about bitcoin when they learn that.)  Bitcoin\'s only claim to value is that the ownership of that imaginary real estate is kept by a *very* secure and incorruptible (well, sort of) notary public.\n\nIf bitcoin were used only as a means of payment -- without anyone holding it for long, quickly spending it or investing it in something else, as one would do with any significant amount of cash -- its price would be less than 5 $/BTC.  That is basic money theory, there is no way around it.\n\nSo the price of bitcoin is 97% due to speculation, and gold\'s may be 80% due to speculation or more.  What is that sustains those prices then?  Speculation means people buying bitcoin for 225 $ today in the hope of selling for more than 225 $ later, whether minutes or decades in the future.  But why would someone buy bitcoin for 250 $ toorrow?  Well, because that buyer would expect to sell it for 280 $ next monday.  And so on.  So, a price defined mainly by speculation is holding  itself up in the air by its wn bootstraps.  All it takes is a wave of pessimism among traders, and they will sell for less than they bought, to cut their losses, and the price will crash (justifying the pessimism, by the way).\n\nOne can have also the opposite, of course: a wave of optimism leading to a price rally and increased specultive buying fed by the rise itself.  We have seen examples of that happening, from the tulip mania and the South Seas Company bubble to the Nov/2013 rally and the spike before the Coinbase flop, I mean, opening.
