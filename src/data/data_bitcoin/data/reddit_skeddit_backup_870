It sits on the patio of my house and no one has decided to go off with it. People know it is my house because, if I follow rules, pay my taxes, the State will register the house to me and use the force of violence to enforce the deed of the house as mine. Except in some extreme cases of squatting... Ownership is enforced by the State. It is a permission. You may own things. With Eminent Domain, the State can and may remove your property. The State's duty to make it so only they can or may remove your property. When other people can and do, the State uses violence to enforce that they may not. \n\nBitcoin is different. With Bitcoin, you may own them but you also can control them. Control is a power beyond ownership. It is not a permission; it is an ability. With Bitcoin, using techniques like bip38 passphrases and brainwallets, the knowledge of a private key can be exclusively withheld by an individual. Unless some asshole perfects mind reading technology and uses it violently to extract private knowledge, Bitcoin is controllable. Can you see how that is better than ownership?

However in other cases, I think the text needs to be much tougher. Particularly regarding safety requirements. Because storing bitcoins for your users, is the same as storing gold. So, you have someone who gives you gold and tells you, \xe2\x80\x9cI would like that gold to still be there when I come back in a week.\xe2\x80\x9d In Order to do that, you will use guards 24/7, you will put surveillance in front of your strong room, that\xe2\x80\x99s usual business. However the bitcoin businesses say, \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s fine, we are hackers, we won\xe2\x80\x99t be pirated.\xe2\x80\x9d And the next day you have someone who actually hacks you. Or for example someone who physically enters your offices, install keys on the computers. Like someone who gets hired as a cleaning agent, and takes advantage of a moment when the offices are empty and do the things I just mentioned. You see that in movies, but it exists also in reality. I think it\xe2\x80\x99s not very complicated to get hired as a cleaning agent in a building where you have a bitcoin business. So, when you get that job and you clean the offices, you have access to the building at hours when it\xe2\x80\x99s generally empty, because you usually clean places when no one is working. It\xe2\x80\x99s a way like any other way to access an office that manages billions of dollars in bitcoin, when the office is empty. That is something that should not be possible. But it is, for many companies it is. You can ask your employer to vacuum his own space to counter that issue. But sometimes you can have an employee who gets hired and whose real intention is just to get access to what you have. This is not a fact, it\xe2\x80\x99s just my opinion. We are dealing on a level where our little hackers who are protected behind their screens, are not anymore on a par to face all the possible cases. If you want to do a bitcoin business nowadays that is secure and safe, you need a security team 24/7 on a computer science level and a 24/7 security team on a physical level, in other words, guards who are in your office 24 hours per day and who keep a close watch on the movements of everybody who gets in and out of the office. To have a security system that you can control and that is efficient, with access cards, badges etc, you have to have audits, in other words, if possible, to have someone who verifies in real time, all the in and outs, like identifying whether this or that person is supposed to be here or there at this particular moment of the day. For example, if the cleaning lady who usually cleans the office in 30 minutes, suddenly takes 2 hours to clean, that\xe2\x80\x99s weird. I say the cleaning agent, because it\xe2\x80\x99s the most usual case. It\xe2\x80\x99s easy to bribe them, for example, at night after work you tell someone, \xe2\x80\x9cI have a problem with that woman, I think she cheats on me, could you bring me her garbage so I can verify that?
