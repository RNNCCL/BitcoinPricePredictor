It is the first time banks have come together to work on a shared way in which the technology that underpins bitcoin - a controversial, web-based \xe2\x80\x9ccrytocurrency\xe2\x80\x9d - can be used in finance.\n\nOver the past year, interest in blockchain technology has grown rapidly. It has already attracted significant investment from many major banks, which reckon it could save them money by making their operations faster, more efficient and more transparent. The new project, the result of more than a year\xe2\x80\x99s worth of consultations between R3, the banks and other members of the financial industry, will be led by R3 CEO David Rutter, formerly CEO of electronic trading at ICAP Electronic Trading, one of the world\xe2\x80\x99s largest interdealer brokers. \xe2\x80\x9cWe held several roundtables ... to deeply consider what the possible implications of the blockchain were, and what it could possibly do to save money, and time, and to create a better paradigm for the world of Wall Street and finance,\xe2\x80\x9d Rutter told Reuters.\n\nThe other seven banks that have signed up to the initiative so far are JP Morgan, State Street, UBS, Royal Bank of Scotland, Credit Suisse, BBVA and Commonwealth Bank of Australia. The blockchain works as a huge, decentralised ledger of every bitcoin transaction ever made that is verified and shared by a global network of computers and therefore is virtually tamper-proof. The Bank of England has a team dedicated to it and calls it a \xe2\x80\x9ckey technological innovation\xe2\x80\x9d.\n\nThe data that can be secured using the technology is not restricted to bitcoin transactions. Two parties could use it to exchange any other information, within minutes and with no need for a third party to verify it.\n\nRutter said the initial focus would be to agree on an underlying architecture, but it had not yet been decided whether that would be underpinned by bitcoin\xe2\x80\x99s blockchain or another one, such as one being built by Ethereum, which offers more features than the original bitcoin technology. Once that had been agreed on, Rutter said, the first use of the technology might be the issuance of commercial paper on the blockchain.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think that these technologies will probably be post-trade,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI think savings are in the settlement side, in post-trade, in issuance, but not in exchange trading or OTC trading any time in the near future.\xe2\x80\x9d He added that R3 will soon announce a few more banks joining the project.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThese new technologies could transform how financial transactions are recorded, reconciled and reported \xe2\x80\x93 all with additional security, lower error rates and significant cost reductions,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hu Liang, Senior Vice President and head of Emerging Technologies at State Street, in a statement.\n\nBy Money Market': 10, 'Ah yes, will that be a private blockchain, completely missing the point?': 9, "Then they aren't even trying to be money.\n\n": 2, 'I have a successful investor friend who I am frequently trying to pitch on Bitcoin and Monero.

Eventually, they will either hedge their bets with bitcoin itself or betray each other by heading for the exits.  \n  \nThe conclusion is that for large public international transactions, we already have our world wide ledger, and there\'s no need to try to reinvent it.': 9, 'I will buy them all': 1, 'I think both of you should know by now that governments, coordinated central banks, commercial banks and credit money  (and the predators that benefit) are just different elements in the same scheme.\n\nFiat will never be UTXOs on a blockchain.

It\'s not a phenomenon of itself, it\'s just how statistics is calculated.\n\nForget about banks. Suppose Bob borrows $100 from Alice and lends it to Claire. How much money is within the system? Depends on how you do the calculation. Only Claire has $100. So one answer is $100.\n\nHowever, suppose Bob will report that Alice has $100 on account. That $100 will be summed to, so we get $200 together. So M0 money supply is $100 and M1 money supply is $200. Additional money was created by lending.\n\nBut wait, shouldn\'t M1 grow when Alice lends money to Bob? No, because money Bob holds on Alice\'s behalf doesn\'t count. That\'s just a useful way to calculating M1: depositing cash into a bank doesn\'t change M1.\n\nOf course, individuals do not have to report how much they owe whom, but banks do, and this is why people say that banks create money: simply because they reveal how much people keep on bank accounts to the central bank, and central bank uses that to compute M1, which grows when bank lend money.\n\n"Money as debt" present this basic fact to make it look like banks do something shoddy, but really they aren\'t.\n\n>  except that right now we also have funny money \n\nHow can it be funny money if it actually works?

No? Well, if you are anything like the average Briton, for example, you have happily deposited \xc2\xa33,000 with your bank on those conditions.\n\n> Why would anyone do that? For one, it is hard to go about life in developed countries legally without a current account. Officially, 97 per cent of British households have at least one current account and the rest are probably\na statistical error. Those accounts function as safe stores of liquidity for savers, guaranteed by the Bank of England. But if that is the simple answer surely it would be easier for everyone to have a current account with their central bank.\n\n> The reason the Bank of England does not accept deposits is that administering 80m personal current accounts, settling 100m daily direct debit payments and maintaining 70,000 cash machines is cumbersome. Far easier to leave that to commercial banks and provide them with a central clearing and settlement platform. Banks are happy to step in, and not just to charge fees for deposits and payments.\n\n> Their main incentive is creating electronic money in vast multiples of the central bank base money. Therefore, in the UK so-called M4 money exceeds that issued by the Bank of England by 30 times. As economics students learn early on, the resulting excess of deposits over reserves is the essence of fractional reserve banking.\nThe combination of deposit-taking and credit- creation functions means even a simple bank, therefore, is operating two fundamentally different businesses. While those functions are interlinked today, it is what James Tobin termed, \xe2\x80\x9cessentially an accident of history.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n> Yet that accident ensures banks have long enjoyed great liberties in determining the broad money supply. Even today, central banks can expand reserves by purchasing financial assets through quantitative easing, but unless commercial banks create assets by making new loans the broad money supply does not expand even as the monetary base grows.\n\n> As a result, this arrangement is being questioned in the post-crisis world. Central banks have despaired with deleveraging banks\xe2\x80\x99 struggle to meet what little credit demand there has been. Yet central banks\xe2\x80\x99 hands are tied by the \xe2\x80\x9caccident of history\xe2\x80\x9d described above. They cannot, for instance, raise broad money supply at will by crediting the reserve accounts of those who would immediately contribute to aggregate demand, a potentially useful tool against high unemployment and low inflation.\n\n> ---\n\n> Enter digital blockchain technology, which has the potential to remedy many of the limitations of the present system. Blockchains promise payment systems that no longer rely on a handful of agents keeping track of who owes what and who owes whom. Before the blockchain, payment systems were regulated by trusted third parties, like a bank, that time-stamped transactions. By contrast, **digital currencies such as Bitcoin are based on decentralised \xe2\x80\x98ledgers\xe2\x80\x99 that record transactions in a particular order without the use of any trusted third party**. The ledger is constructed and jointly administered by all members of the network. The legitimacy of the transaction is verified by network members devoting their computer processing power to check that the currency unit in question can be traced from the sender\xe2\x80\x99s account all the way down its chain to the first creation of the unit.\n\n> **This makes it possible for central banks to issue digital money without relying on commercial banks within a fractional reserve banking system**. By maintaining accounts directly with the public, central banks can effectively separate the deposit-taking function from the credit-creation function currently embedded in commercial banks. In doing so they may, by other means, achieve what the \xe2\x80\x98Chicago Plan\xe2\x80\x99 for full reserve banking attempted in 1934.\n\n> **Ironically, this will be anathema to Bitcoin users, the biggest proponents of blockchain technology, who envision it as an alternative to state-sponsored money**. However, that radical monetary philosophy has unnecessarily marred the implementation of a revolutionary technology. For **without the backing of the state, Bitcoin remains unanchored**. Since citizens ultimately need to pay taxes in their home currency, **receiving salaries in Bitcoin is a huge risk given the Bitcoin exchange rates fluctuate wildly**.\n\n> **For digital money to hold its value, central banks need to guarantee convertibility. This is the idea behind the so-called Fedcoin [1] where a central bank issues and controls the blockchain and renders Fedcoin legal tender at parity with, say, conventional dollars. If the Fedcoin\xe2\x80\x99s value drops below the dollar, arbitrageurs would swap it for dollars at the discount window, whereupon digital units would be deleted from the ledger until parity was effectively restored.** The central bank is uniquely capable of doing this; any other private actor would be vulnerable to a run if they offered convertibility between conventional dollars and a digital currency.\n\n> For consumers, holding and exchanging money via Fedcoin would incur lower transaction costs than, say, through bank accounts or credit cards. Equally important, **the value of Fedcoin would be even more explicitly guaranteed by the central bank than commercial bank deposits**. Soon enough, digital cash underwritten by the central bank would replace electronic money generated by the banking system.\n\n> Meanwhile, **for policymakers, such a payment mechanism eliminates the potential systemic risk posed by commercial bank failures**. Moving from a daily clearing and settlement system to one in which each transaction is settled immediately reduces counterparty risk. **Broad money supply could then be controlled absolutely without technical impediments. And digital cash would finally make the zero lower bound on policy rates redundant for inflation- targeting central banks, as the blockchain\xe2\x80\x99s underlying algorithm could be adjusted to reduce the value of Fedcoin over time.**\n\n> ---\n\n> **If the Fedcoin took off, it would appear to be the death knell for credit card providers and deposit-taking institutions. Banks would have two options to avoid economic obsolescence.** The first would be to transition toward a pure investment banking strategy, financed entirely via equity and long-term debt raised from savers aware of the risk they were taking. Indeed, this is the model favoured by neo-classical economists harking back to the ideas of Irving Fisher.\n\n> A second option would be to attract Fedcoin deposits by providing services such as verification for know-your-customer and anti-money-laundering rules or secure digital wallets or even just the most user-friendly apps. Banks could compete for Fedcoin deposits by issuing their own blockchains, at par with Fedcoin. Deutsche Bank, for example, could issue dbCoin, which customers use to settle transactions with any counterparty, much like\na digital chequebook. Banks would guarantee convertibility of their digital currencies into Fedcoin, and central banks offer clearing and settlement facilities.\n\n> This brings us full circle back to today\xe2\x80\x99s system, but with a couple of important exceptions. For starters, the difference between the monetary base and bank-created, branded money would be considerably clearer. More important, perhaps, **the technological obsolescence of deposit-taking institutions engenders greater economic competitiveness. The banking sector would no longer be rewarded for processing payments or managing current accounts.** It would have to compete for deposits by offering better services and ultimately greater responsibility for the money it creates.\n\n> **Fedcoin remains a thought experiment. The humbling conclusion for banks is that neither customers nor central banks necessarily have to depend on their oldest services much longer.** Although hard to imagine in the current low-interest rate environment, technological change may structurally raise banks\xe2\x80\x99 funding costs. If banks are to compete with the emerging fintech and shadow-banking industries for household savings, they will need to offer far more than in the past.\n\n> [1] **The idea of a government cryptocurrency has been discussed by others including David Andolfatto, a researcher at the Federal Reserve of St Louis.**': 14, 'he problem was that they just needed MORE control.

And if so...': 1, "The NSA vaguely recommending something isn't really evidence for anything. As this article mentions, there's a whole 19-page paper by respected cryptographers discussing all of the possibilities for what the NSA could be doing here. We really can't take much of anything from the NSA's statement at this time. The public academia knows of no hints whatsoever of any weakness in ECC. And the NSA is known to often give bad advice and insert backdoors into standards, so there's a good chance that they're actually recommending this because it makes people *less* secure. In particular, they seem to recommend sticking with RSA rather than moving to ECC, but RSA is IMO is one of the most likely algorithms to be compromised (since it is simple mathematically and also by far the most widely-used).": 2, "Thanks for the comment.  \n  \nIs there any ELI12 links that can help describe how a traditional algorithm can be quantum resistant? (for those who have a basic understanding of quantum computing and cryptography but don't quite grasp all the details) ": 1, 'Traditional public-key crypto algorithms all rely (directly or indirectly) on the assumption that it\'s difficult to factor very large numbers. Quantum computers can very efficiently factor large numbers using Shor\'s Algorithm. So it is known *for sure* that RSA, DSA, and Bitcoin\'s ECDSA will be totally broken if a large enough quantum computer was ever created. But it seems that we\'re ~10-20 years away from this yet, so these algorithms are still considered safe.\n\nLamport signatures instead use only hash functions. Hash functions are not vulnerable to Shor\'s Algorithm because they don\'t have anything to do with prime numbers. They are vulnerable to Grover\'s Algorithm, but this only square-roots the security (ie. SHA-256 has its security reduced from 256-bit=2^256 to 128-bit=2^128), which is acceptable when you\'re dealing with 256-bit crypto. Additionally, cryptographers generally feel much safer with crypto based on scrambling input (all commonly-used symmetric encryption and hash functions) rather than crypto based on applying mathematical functions believed to be "one-way" (all commonly-used public-key crypto), since it\'s considered probably much easier to figure out how to undo the "one-wayness" of mathematical functions than to undo the kind of scrambling used in stuff like SHA-2.\n\nLamport signatures are also a lot faster than traditional public-key crypto. The reason that they\'re almost never used is that their signatures and public keys are *vastly* larger, and at a basic level Lamport public keys can only safely be used to sign something *once* -- you\'d need some additional structure (a tree of public keys or something) to support multiple signatures.\n\nThere are also quantum-resistant mathematical asymmetric encryption techniques such as supersingular ECC, but this is a somewhat immature area of research, and I certainly know basically nothing about it.': 5, 'What about [quantum computing attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0301141)?\n\n[SIDH appears to be a solution.](http://eprint.iacr.org/2011/506.pdf)\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this?': 1, "As far as anyone in the public knows, there's no new research that has even slightly weakened ECC.

Probably no action is required in the Bitcoin space until we get something more solid, especially since Bitcoin doesn't use a NIST/NSA curve -- ECC in general would have to be broken for Bitcoin to be affected.\n\nAny new crypto can be added to Bitcoin as a softfork in a totally backward-compatible way. It's considered unlikely for Bitcoin's secp256k1 to be broken without all of ECC being broken, so perhaps the next new crypto to be added will be some sort of Lamport Signature scheme, which is also very strong against quantum computers (and in fact very unlikely to be weak to *any* attack).\n\nOne annoying thing is that secp256k1 has only 128-bit security, while most of Bitcoin's crypto has 256-bit security.
