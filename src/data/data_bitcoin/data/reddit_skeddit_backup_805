Check it out \nhttps://vimeo.com/106725097': 2, 'Gems is the first project that I feel can bring bitcoin to the average person in a technology we all use everyday.': 2, 'Its the first crypto wallet and encrypted chat': 1, 'Seems like more marketing than development effort.  Makes me skeptical.': 2, "Well this was a nice balanced conversation. I'm sure your way of getting mainstream adoption works too. Let me guess, a programmer by trade?": 1, 'what can you do with Litecoin that justifies $ 124,767,297 marketcap? What justifies Litecoin 1,105 GH/s Hashrate? How many Litecoin users are there? what can you buy with Litecoin? (I can ask these questions regarding most altcoins)\n\nThe reason we started with the Gems project is because at the moment there isn\xe2\x80\x99t a strong incentive or easy way for the masses to enter the Bitcoin ecosystem. Gems tries to solves this problem by taking the most adopted form of online communication, mobile social messaging, and introducing a value reward system built on top of bitcoin.\n\nCurrently, when introducing Bitcoin to most new users, the process remains very complicated. We go to Blockchain.info, set up a wallet and then explain about public and private keys, two-factor authentication, cold storage and so on. It takes us typically 1 to 2 hours to introduce someone new to Bitcoin to get them set up in the ecosystem. (forget about trying to explain Blockchain.info UX to your parents or younger brothers)\n\nThrough Gems, we make all of this very simple. The registration process takes 10 seconds. Your username serves as your Bitcoin address. From the beginning, you\xe2\x80\x99ll automatically have a few GEMS to play with -- so right from the start you\xe2\x80\x99ll be using a cryptocurrency without doing anything difficult.\n\nBlockchain.info has roughly 2 million wallets after approximately three years of operation. 2 million wallets means a few hundred thousand users, because most users will have multiple wallets. The reason why Bitcoin is not going mainstream is because there is no actual application for new users to start using cryptocurrencies. This is the gap Gems is bridging very comfortably. At the moment there is no competition for Gems. There are no other applications for new users to adopt the use of cryptocurrencies.\n\nOn the social side, having a social network with a built-in monetizing system opens many possibilities in the long run. The Gems platform allows users to decide whether they want to view advertisements; with the incorporated in-app currency and payment system we can have e-commerce thrive within the Gems network.\n\nFor scalability, to allow a large number of users who will be sending and receiving small amounts of tokens using the Bitcoin blockchain normally requiring fees, Gems will utilize a hybrid system for on-chain and off-chain transactions. This allows most Gems transactions to remain virtually feeless.\n\nOur focus groups have shown us that if you are introduced a new concept like cryptocurrencies through an application like a messenger or a texting app, the transition is effortless. If the application we are introducing looks and feels like an app the users are already familiar with, like WhatsApp, they are very quick to adopt the new application. If you try to introduce a complex subject such as cryptocurrencies through an online wallet system like Blockchain.info, the new user will get lost in the process. A mobile messaging app will allow us to grow the user base rapidly, bringing value to both users and the network.\n\nThe biggest selling point for Gems is that the mobile app makes it effortless for users to enter the Bitcoin ecosystem, while rewarding participation within the network. In addition, instead of public keys, Gems uses aliases for bitcoin addresses, making bitcoin transactions easy between users.\n\nOur heart is in the right place and with the help of the crypto community to grow the network, Gems will be an important step for mainstream adoption.\n\nThe "killer app" for bitcoin isn\'t creating a decentralized storage or other complicated technical projects, it\'s making the process to join the ecosystem as easy as possible. \n\nIt\'s also important to note that btc and gems serve different target audiences within the Gems ecosystem. btc is aimed towards users with crypto background, who probably already own BTC and are familiar with it. These users will enjoy a convenient method to send btc to their contacts (ie. without typing addresses). Gems is aimed towards the common user who doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have a crypto currency background. Since gems are rewarded for network contribution, these users will own gems just from operating within the network. \n\nWe are sure that once mainstream users do their first "crypto transaction" they will understand what all of us are talking about.

If the side chains-specific Opcode\'s ever make it into Bitcoin, someone will make a subcurrency inside Ethereum that is 2-way-pegged to BTC, and so Ethereum will in some sense "become a side chain". But that point is trivial; the larger point is that the way side chain are being marketed is "we don\'t need more independent currencies", and in the case of price stability that is clearly false. In multi-currency networks, I could easily see there being at least three coins: a "stable coin", an "investment coin", and a few sidechains of other coins.': 1, "I'd think anyone heavily invested in altcoins is cringing slightly at this development.": 6, '>  In Cryptography we trust \n\n\nYou realize how dumb this sounds?': 1, "So the first point to keep in mind is that the two-way pegging requires either scripts to have state beyond binary spent/unspent, or scripts to be able to limit what kinds of outputs they spend to (which is basically a way to replicate the concept of state but moving the UTXO around), both features currently unavailable in Bitcoin.\n\nThe way the opcode basically would work is:\n\n1. To claim 1 BTC from one of these lockbox scripts, an owner of sidecoins would need to destroy 1 sidecoin, and the destruction transaction would need to reference a specific UTXO in Bitcoin (otherwise, the same destroyed sidecoin could be used to claim BTC over and over again).\n2. Then, the sidecoin owner would need to wait 100 blocks, and create an SPV proof consisting of (1) a Merkle tree proof that the sidecoin destruction happened, and (2) 100 blocks going back from that proof.\n3. The sidecoin owner can submit the proof to the script, and the script will wait 24 hours before releasing the BTC.\n4. Now, during that time, anyone else can submit an even longer SPV proof, and claim the BTC themselves. In this way, through a contest we prevent people from claiming BTC by destroying sidecoins on any chain other than the main chain.\n\n(4) is critical; without (4) a mining pool can claim BTC by quietly mining 100 blocks off the main chain, and then using that to steal all the sidecoins. However, (4) is where contracts having state comes in.\n\nPersonally, I was looking forward to seeing them come up with a nice generalized way to add expressiveness to Bitcoin's scripting language that makes the sidechain verification script possible; so I'm actually a bit disappointed that OP\\_SIDECHAINPROOFVERIFY is all they have. Having a single opcode to handle an _entire_ standardized process of verifying a sidechain has several disadvantages:\n\n1. It prevents innovative Merkle tree structures (eg. the Patricia tree Ethereum relies on)\n2. It hampers innovative blockchain structures (eg. Aviv Zohar's Ghost++ block-DAG models)\n3. It hampers innovation in mining algorithms, eg. ASIC-resistant, IO-bound, proof of stake, useful PoW, etc.\n4. It makes it difficult to make further improvements to the sidechain proof verification process itself\n\nI would have preferred either of:\n\n1. Something like Peter Todd's OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY plus an opcode that allows scripts to restrict who their outputs go to (note that this, plus some Y-combinator-like recursive magic, could probably be used to implement generalized scripting, except with the properties that (i) long-term scripts would not have a single position on the blockchain that they could be reliably accessed and (ii) scripts could not talk to each other), or\n2.

": 8, 'Here\'s my usual take on drugs and violence:\n\nThe way I see it, there are three ways that drugs can be associated with violence: (1) black-market violence; (2) acquisitive-crime violence to feed an addiction; and (3) under-the-influence violence (i.e., the psychoactive effects of a particular drug increase an individual\xe2\x80\x99s propensity for violence). With respect to category 3 violence, alcohol is BY FAR the worst offender. Drug prohibition CREATES category 1 violence and exacerbates category 2 and 3 violence by, respectively, making a person\xe2\x80\x99s addiction more expensive and encouraging people who want to \xe2\x80\x9cget high\xe2\x80\x9d to use legal booze to get there. It is a moronic and disastrous policy.\n\nEdit: it occurs to me that I need to add a fourth category -- direct state violence resulting from the state\'s attempts to enforce prohibition (e.g., sending men with guns to arrest and cage people for "crimes" such as unlawful plant possession). Obviously, the violence in this category is also created by prohibition.': 5, "Sad, but true.\n\n\nI know a lot of LEOs.  In my experience, most are fine.

That doesn\'t mean that if there was no state, there would be no violence. What kind of a fairytale viewpoint is that?\n\nIf it were legal, it would be the state, or an entity acting in the same function, that would keep it controlled. Like with alcohol. That is why drugs "being legal" would be better. Making it legal would mean building an environment in which it can be legal. That would still require rules.': 1, "I wouldn't pat each other on the backs regarding SR just yet - ars technica is running a story about how someone has doxxed the Judge on the case, with personal threats:\n\nhttp://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2014/10/death-threats-against-judge-in-silk-road-trial-emerge-from-darknet/\n\nAs for decriminalization, it would help, but its going to be a long slow road for most governments to rewrite their laws.": 0, 'Link to the paper upon which this article is based.\n\nhttp://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2436643': 12, 'Citizen, this plant makes you think differently - therefore it is forbidden.

I am all for legalisation, but believe that the state is an important instrument for protecting us against ourselves and facilitating our advancement as human beings in a safe enviroment (a blend of Hobbes and Locke). \n\nDrug dealers and gangs are willing to fight/kill each other for the right to sell their product even when they could end up spending the rest of their lives in prison as a result.
