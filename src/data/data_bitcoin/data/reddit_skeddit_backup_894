I would argue that money laundering laws and their enforcement is the corruption, not people with "illegal" money from voluntary transactions with others.': 2, 'Welcome. Thank you for asking the question. Now prepare to enter the rabbit hole.\n\nBasicially corruption, taxation, asset forfeiture especially the latter two are just other ways of describing theft. The government is a criminal institution, if it was susceptible to its own laws. If you do not pay tax, they will throw you in prison, if you do not go to prison, they will drag you, if you do not let them drag you, ie. arm yourself, barricade yourself, they will kick down the door, and probably shoot to kill you, if you defend yourself. This is legitimate. However if any other person tried to extort someone for money like this. They would be seen as a criminal.\n\nSo how does bitcoin end taxation, asset forfeiture, and the corruption that springs up around it. Wel, the government is a big institution. This is due to central banking, and the ability to create money out of thin air. All these people, this police, and sometimes military, that does the governments bidding, needs money. Normally you tax people, but when government is such a size it is today, you cannot tax people to get the money. The tax burdon would be too big, people would rebel. So instead money is created out of thin air, and loaned to the government, thats how its able to afford taxation, corruption, asset forfeitures, and all the other stuff it does. Thats how its so big. Bitcoin changes this, because its sound money. The government cannot manipulate it per say. They cannot get it easily, and therefor the government has to be more sound as well......': 4, 'Bitcoin will certainly make corruption problems worse, a lot worse, as a fair amount of the money laundering laws that bitcoin help people get around is designed to stop corruption.\n\nI doubt it will do much for taxation, as governments have the ability to throw people in jail until they do what the governments wanted them to do.\n\nAsset forfeiture, it might help a bit with, as the person can probably resist the initial seizure better.': 1, "I think you misunderstand me somewhere...I'm not saying anything like that.": 1, 'There are two kinds of low taxes. The good kind, where taxes are low, and people keep most of their money. There is the bad kind, where taxes are sky high, but people can get around the tax laws. In the bad kind of low taxes, success in business is based on how well you can evade the tax laws and grease the hands of the regulators. Bitcoin will suck for the good kind of low taxes, but will increase the bad kind.\n\nExample of the good kind is Singapore, and example of the bad kind is Greece.': 1, "Oh dear, there's a lot of fluff in all these replies. Alas Bitcoin is just a protocol, not a pancea for society's ills. Switching to bitcoin doesn't actually change very much, and where it does it's very often a double-edged sword.\n\nLet's look at your examples:\n\n**Corruption** - I'm guessing most corruption around the world involves cash, bitcoin is slightly easier to hide than cash so on paper bitcoin would make corruption marginally easier. Converesely bitcoin payments leave a trail of sorts, which might put people off using it. Close call. Either way a healthy judicial system and competative media sector is still the best weapon against corruption.\n\n**Unfair taxation** - Bitcoin doesn't come with a tax policy so it's hard to argue that it has any bearing whatsoever on taxation. Arguably bitcoin makes tax evasion easier, but tax evasion is not new, and it's not clear to me that tax evasion is an effective weapon against unfair taxation anyhow.\n\n**Asset Forfeiture** - Bitcoin isn't going to make your car any more or less forfeit-able. Bitcoins themselves can be protected from forfeiture if you are careful (arguably so can cash and gold, though it's probably easier with bitcoins). You can argue either way as to weather making assets harder to seize is a good thing or not (bad if you don't like drug barons or corrupt politicians, good if you're an innocent citizen unfairly discriminated against by the state).\n\n...and for fun, one you didn't mention:\n**Wealth distribution** - One might argue that if society's wealth were more evenly distributed then life would be fairer (as long as your assets aren't being forfeited in order to do this of course!). The main mechanism for this is taxation, but equally inflation helps too. If you remove inflation then arguably it means that wealthy people have an easier time remaining wealthy.\n\nStill the takeaway message should be that bitcoin doesn't come with a taxation policy or much of an economic policy, so on it's own doesn't make much difference. Society's problems still need to be tackled via political and economic solutions just as they have been for the last 200 years or so.": 1, "Funny that everything you mentioned as an example of illegal income involves bribing government officials, who are the corrupt ones.\n\nEven still, this is petty corruption compared to the multi billion (trillion?) dollar corruptions that bail out or banks, war profiteer, murder millions of people around the world (formprofit), imprison people for victimless crimes, etc.  these things are all funded via deficit spending and the ability to print money and create inflation.  If we had to be taxed to pay for all these, the tax rate would be higher than 100%, because the money doesn't exist!\n\nEdit: to be clear, I'm not arguing against the government here, I'm just saying that a sound money, especially one that can be evasive of government claws, like bitcoin can keep the government and it's massive corruption/violence machine somewhat in check.": 1, "Thanks for the detailed response. Not sure why I'm being downvoted.": 1, "Unfair taxation is redundant.\n\nFor asset forfeiture, look at Ross Ulbricht, they arrested him and confiscated his computers and STILL couldn't get access to all of his bitcoins.  For all we know, he may still own thousands of bitcoins that the government can't access.  Governments just can't take your bitcoins if you protect them properly...they may not be able to even know that you 'have' them.\n\nBitcoin can alleviate one of the biggest social problems in developed countries, which is theft via inflation and the printing of money.  Bitcoin interest rates cannot be 'price fixed' by a central bank etiher, and the interest rate is one of the most important prices in the economy to send the right signals to investors.  In developing areas, bitcoin can give people safety in knowing that no one can 'steal' their wealth, either via a breakin/robbery, or via money printing/corrupt governments.  In some ways, bitcoin self-enforces property rights on itself when private keys are properly managed and stored securely.\n\nIn terms of corruption, I'm not sure bitcoin eliminates corruption (nothing does), but if you can't print money, the practical things that the corrupt people can do is severely restricted, imo, because they still have to get money from the free market to do the things they want to achieve.": 7, "I have been thinking of something like that too... \n\nBItcoin is set to decentralize and give freedom to financial controls by the state. it's also improtant the rule of the law must prevail but it is the best way to proof corruption, abuse of power and so on...\n\nBItcoin must be paired with a kind of peer governance where each have to give an important value to his neighbor. this can speed up social development.

The decision about how the funds are disbursed from that account is entirely a matter of negotiation between the parties. It's true that the incentives alter after the goods are delivered, but only in subjective ways that can't really be measured. The collateral payments are sunk costs at this point, and so also irrelevant.\n\nYou can attempt to create a cryptographic lock so that the only outputs are (buyer gets 0, seller gets full btc amount), (buyer gets 0, seller gets 0) (or similar) - that certainly makes it *practically* more difficult for a corrupt buyer to engage in negotiation (or blackmail if you prefer). But the incentive/game theory aspects trump the cryptography here, because it will always be possible for the buyer to open up a dialog with the seller in order to discuss off-channel offsetting payments (attempting to enforce perfect anonymity between participants can help with this problem (although not completely eliminate it), but is tremendously difficult to achieve perfectly and such attempts would largely destroy market functionality). \n\nNotice also that in the anonymous case, the users have to rely on counterparties acting as *rational* agents when they know nothing about them; in other words, they have to assume that every human being acts rationally. Not a recipe for success.\n\nNotice that none of these problems *necessarily* arise with payment for purely digital goods with can be cryptographically locked. In that case you can arrange for an atomic transaction in which the goods are unlocked by the payment. But for a trade (crypto)<-->(physical goods or fiat or other goods based on trusted entities) I don't believe the 2 of 2 approach is sound.\n \n\n\n": 1, "> To come into this thread and make the bold claim this system doesn't actually work, when it's already been implemented in software\n\nIrrelevant. The question is not whether the software works (it's trivial given Bitcoin multisig) - the question is whether the incentive structure works.\n\nEdit: I take this back. Having had a careful look at the whitepaper, I can't actually grok how it's supposed to work (apart from the paper just generally being very difficult to read, some of the Bitcoin stuff doesn't actually appear to make sense), and I can't find a codebase to read anywhere.": 1, 'BitHalo you can microtrade.

I guess we don't think of two person escrow because with normal assets this isn't possible. But with crypto we can have a multisig transaction where it's not like if I'm holding the other person's money in escrow I can just keep it for myself. It's either stop the transaction or let it go back to the person who put it in. No chance of taking it for yourself. That's really cool. \n\nBut still I can see potential problems. What if the person sends the product but it's not the right thing or it's slightly defective. Do you hold the money in escrow not releasing it to punish the vendor, but hurting yourself in the process? It seems like a high bar for the injustice to be bad enough that you're willing to harm yourself (losing the escrow money) in the name of justice.\n": 1, "Both the buyer and seller have more to lose by not signing than signing.

Before we get into the facts, there is no question that one should always be suspicious of fraudulent activity when it comes to CC < - > BTC services. However, your logic is flawed more broadly. \n\nFor starters, just because a service can be used fraudulently, doesn\'t mean that there aren\'t regular folk using it normally. It would be a shame if we had to completely shut down a service because some % of bad actors (assuming it\'s < some reasonable amount) were abusing it. Since when did we let the bad guys dictate the terms of our daily transactions?\n\n> If you sell your BTC for way above market price you will likely be caught out and can face real fraud charges in real life. \n\nWhat makes you think this exactly? You seem to ignore what chinawat said regarding LB. Each payment method comes with its own risk, and as a result there are various premiums one might charge to accept that payment. \n\nNo one is putting a gun to the buyers head and saying "accept my 30% fee!" It\'s an active decision to do that; just watch the daily activity on LB... people pay crazy premiums for chargeback-able payment methods. Why? Who knows, maybe that is the only way they can get their hands on the btc. Perhaps they actually want the chargeback protection in case they get defrauded by the btc seller. Regardless, it\'s not really up to you and me to decide what prices are appropriate for other people. They get to decide that.\n\nNow, if there is in fact rampant fraud on Purse, then the service simply won\'t last. Plain and simple. Currently there have been no major accusations against them that haven\'t been resolved quickly (so far as I am aware) and there is no way they would stick around if Amazon caught on to rampant fraud. Perhaps you are right and it\'s a ticking time bomb, but that\'s not something anyone here can currently prove. You opine like it\'s the truth, however, which seems questionable at best.

It is thus normal to expect that such trades happen at a premium. That does not imply that such a transaciton is fraudulent, rather it shows the inability of the processor to accurately distinguish fraudulent transactions in advance. On the other hand, a credit card is a common and easily accessible form of short term credit. So using a credit card to buy bitcoins can be desirable from the point of view of a buyer, but they also need to expect a higher price.\n\nNow, Amazon deals with credit cards fraud a lot, so they have worked out sophisticated methods how to mitigate the risk. I\'m pretty sure they also apply statistical analysis on their use of APIs, so if they have a problem with purse.io, their triggers will pop up and they can deal with them. I wonder why you are attempting to do Amazon\'s fraud department\'s job for them?\n\nIn essence, purse.io outsources their credit card fraud analysis to Amazon. I\'m sure they are both run by mature adults who can make their own decision about whether or not to entertain a commercial relationship.\n\nThe chance that you won\'t receive the product that has been ordered for you and you\'ll lose the Bitcoins as well might affect digital goods, but for physical goods it doesn\'t exist, because purse.io holds the funds in escrow and they are only released if you confirm the delivery.\n\nThe allegation that the spender of Bitcoins is "facilitating fraud", besides not being supported by evidence, is equally meaningful as arguing that Amazon facilitates fraud.': 1, "> If you work it so you are getting 30% you are probably facilitating fraud and can face criminal penalties in real life whether you're aware of it or not.\n\nAh you know what, I misunderstood you.

I am not sure that is the case, perhaps there is some precedent set for a scenario like that. My hunch would be that the honest party has plausible deniability and that the fault would lie instead with the dishonest party and Purse for not doing their diligence on their customers.

AAPL -0.83%  \'s latest iPhone, which for the first time will let customers make payments with the device in brick-and-mortar stores, according to people familiar with the situation. An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment.\n\nThe move is part of a broader push by card-issuing banks and merchants to improve security for electronic payments. The vulnerability of merchant systems was highlighted again this week when Home Depot Inc. HD +1.04%  said that it might have been the victim of a data breach.\n\nCalled "tokenization," the new technology can be used for online transactions, payments made in a physical store with a smartphone, and with merchant applications that consumers load onto a smartphone. By getting rid of the sensitive card information, banks and merchants can leave hackers with nothing of value to steal if they break into their computer servers.\n\n"There is a recognition that we all need to evolve the payment standards to embrace what is going on around us," said Jim McCarthy, Visa\'s global head of innovation and strategic partnerships. Hackers increasingly are going after brick-and-mortar stores. Target Corp. TGT +1.06%  last year suffered a data breach in which thieves stole 40 million payment-card numbers and the personal information of 70 million shoppers. Criminals recently have stolen card data from consumers who used plastic at Asian bistro chain P.F. Chang\'s China Bistro Inc. and a string of grocery stores that operate as Albertsons, Acme and Jewel-Osco.\n\n\nTarget suffered a breach in 2013. Getty Images\nAll told, fraud losses on existing bank accounts and credit-card accounts rose 45% in 2013 to $16 billion, according to Javelin Strategy & Research, a consulting firm that is a unit of Greenwich Associates LLC.\n\nSeparately, merchants already are installing new terminals at cash registers to accept cards embedded with computer chips that are more secure than traditional plastic cards with magnetic strips.\n\nFinancial institutions are expected to issue 575 million of those cards by the end of next year, reducing the ability for hackers to create counterfeit cards if they break into a merchant\'s computer system.\n\nBut as transactions become more secure in physical stores, there is concern thieves will migrate to online transactions, as they did in countries that have already switched to chip cards.\n\n"Anything we can do at this point that speeds the process of getting the card data off the merchant system is a positive," said Julie Conroy, a research director at Aite Group, a card industry consulting firm.\n\nIn the U.S., the rate of online fraud is rising as more consumers shop online. It represents 16% of U.S. card fraud, according to the Members Group, a Des Moines, Iowa, company that provides card processing and other payment services to credit unions and community banks.\n\nIn the tokenization process, the merchant can conduct a normal transaction without seeing or storing the customer\'s account number, expiration date or other information contained on a card. The actual card data is stored by the card issuer or processor in a "virtual vault."\n\nAlthough it has a similar name, the latest push is different from programs launched by some banks about a decade ago in which they issued physical security tokens to customers for use in online transactions.\n\nCard industry executives said tokenization is particularly useful for merchants who store account information for recurring transactions, such as a monthly gym membership.\n\n"We continue to hear from retailers that they don\'t want to be in the security business, that they want to get the card data out of their environment," said Craig Hoffman, a lawyer at BakerHostetler LLP in Cincinnati who advises merchants on data breach issues.\n\nUnlike other security measures that involve new cards for consumers and updated payment hardware for merchants, the token process takes place only between the merchant and the card processor or issuer. Consumers are unaware that the merchant is receiving a unique number for a transaction instead of the card information.\n\nThe industry\'s effort "isn\'t solely about putting chips on cards. It\'s about making sure the underlying systems can make all of these transactions more secure," said Ed McLaughlin, chief emerging payments officer at MasterCard.\n\nIndustry executives said the new process usually adds a penny or two of cost for merchants each time a token is generated for a transaction.\n\nMany merchants are hesitant to discuss security measures.\n\nDustee Jenkins, a spokeswoman for Target, said the retailer isn\'t using tokens, but "it is a topic that we, along with many other participants, are actively engaged in with the payments industry as a potential feature of future payment processing."': 9, 'Paywall': 1, 'Wow, the credit-card industry must be losing a lot of money! /s\n\nNo they are not!

So they don't invest because of two reason:  they don't want to lose money and they still want to be able to buy bread at the grocery store.  \n\nWhen people read more about bitcoin, I find that they're generally supportive of it.

You can buy computer parts, curtains, and artisanal coffee beans, but not bread at the grocery store down the street.

Your role and abilities are diminished. Eventually, you may lose that role and those abilities altogether. If you think of your controlling role and power as an integral part of your identity, you may see independence as a direct attack on yourself.\n\nIn simpler terms: Most often, the people who rise to power did so intentionally, either because they wanted power for its own sake, or because they needed power to accomplish some other goal. They want power, so anything that takes it away from them is undesirable to them.\n\nFrom the perspective of the individual: Independence means accountability for whatever it is you\'re taking control of. Your responsibility is increased, and your day-to-day existence demands more effort and attention. Eventually, you may need to micromanage all the minutiae of your daily life, increasing your stress and depriving you of relaxation. \n\nIn simpler terms: Most people have something that they\'re responsible for, but which they would be happy to "let someone else handle for me."
