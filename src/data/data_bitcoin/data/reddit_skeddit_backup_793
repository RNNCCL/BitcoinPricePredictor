Payments for the following are not eligible for reimbursement under PayPal Buyer Protection:\n\n    Intangible items, including Digital Goods (subject to exceptions as listed in Section 7.6\n    Services\n    Real estate\n    Businesses (when you buy a business)\n    Vehicles, including motorcycles, caravans, aircrafts and boats\n    Custom made items with SNAD issues\n    Travel tickets, including airline flight tickets\n    Items that violate PayPal\xe2\x80\x99s Acceptable Use Policy\n    Purchases made on eBay that violate eBay\xe2\x80\x99s Prohibited or Restricted Items Policy\n    Items which you collect in person, or arrange to be collected on your behalf, including at a retail point of sale\n    Industrial machinery used in manufacturing\n    Items equivalent to cash, including prepaid or gift cards\n    Personal Payments\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nDue to the fact that the above changes to their user agreement did not specifically mention bitcoin, cryptocurrencies, or digital currencies of any kind, I reached out to PayPal for further clarification on this issue. A PayPal spokesperson responded, \xe2\x80\x9cThe PayPal buyer protections only apply to physical goods and do not cover digital items, which would include crypto currencies like Bitcoin.\xe2\x80\x9d In other words, these updated terms do remove PayPal Buyer Protection from sales of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.': 1, 'Personally I DO NOT agree!\n\nWhen I sell Bitcoin to someone, my address will show that the Bitcoin has moved from my Wallet to the buyers Wallet!\n\nThis is VERY easy to confirm or even automate.\n\nAs long as the charge back is removed, BITCOIN should be the safest item to sell through paypal!\n\nWhen both Wallets show an actual transaction - HOW is it then one can claim fraud?': 1}, ('How to Create a Multi-Signature Bitcoin Address (4-min video)', 4): {'Check out copay.io. much simpler that what I just watched.

For example: 00=adenine, 01=cytosine, 10=guanine, 11=thymine.\n\nHowever, humans are 99.9% genetically similar to one another. So, if we choose one genome sequence as the 'reference genome' to which all others are compared, we can significantly compress the data needed.\n\nThat means there are 6 million discrepancies, on average, to the reference genome. If each base is represented by 2 bits, that means we get it down to 1.5 MB!\n\nBut wait, we're not out of the woods yet. Because we actually need to encode, somehow, where these discrepancies (a.k.a. polymorphisms) lie in the genome.\n\nI don't know much about data compression, but it seems to me the best strategy for referencing locational info is just to encode the 'gap size' between each polymorphism. So the data structure would alternate predictably between [2 bits encoding base] and [? bits encoding gap].\n\nNow to make a good data structure with minimal information needed, we ought to know the distribution of distances between polymorphisms. [I found one here](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1861817/figure/F1/). Due to clustering of polymorphisms (hotspots for genetic variation in the genome) the typical distance is actually less than one would expect simply by dividing the total bases (6 billion) by the number of discrepancies (6 million).\n\nIt looks like from that graph we have:\n\n    25% within 1-25 bases\n    13% within 26-50 bases\n    10% within 51-75 bases\n    8% within 76-100 bases\n    6% within 101-125 bases\n    5% within 126-150 bases\n    4% within 151-175 bases\n    3% within 176-200 bases\n    2% within 201-225 bases\n    2% within 226-250 bases\n    2% within 251-275 bases\n    1% within 276-300 bases\n    \xe2\x88\xb4 19% >301 bases\n\nTo save bits, we can bin gaps into different size categories, and can reserve the first two bits of each gap code to specify which one. For example: 00 = 5 bit number (1 to 32 base gap) which covers ~33% of gaps (I'm estimating), 01 = 8 bit number (33 to 288 base gap) which covers an additional ~50% of gaps, 10 = 10 bit number (289 to 1312 base gap) which covers maybe another ~11% of gaps, and then 11 = 20 bit number (for up to about a million base gap) which ought to cover the remaining 6% of gaps. We would reserve two of these 20 bit numbers to represent indel type polymorphisms (insertions/deletions), which would set off the inclusion of additional data to specify the details needed for the 'compiler' to recapitulate these polymorphisms when looking at the reference genome (For simplicity I'll neglect indel data structures in my estimate below).\n\nSo with this rough compression scheme, and according to my assumptions, we have:\n\n    6 million polymorphisms * (2 bits) = 12 million bits\n\nThen for our different gaps:\n\n    6 million gaps * (0.33) * (7 bits) = 14 million bits\n    6 million gaps * (0.50) * (10 bits) = 30 million bits\n    6 million gaps * (.11) * (12 bits) = 8 million bits\n    6 million gaps * (.06) * (22 bits) = 8 million bits\n\nTotal is 72 million bits, or 9 MB.\n\nI'm sure there are better compression tricks or optimizations that could make it even smaller though. \n    \n": 9, 'I just want cheap strong accellerated VPNs everywhere such that whether or not someone is mining or acting as a VPN service / SSL webdite would be somewhat unknowable.

': 1, 'Thanks! :)': 1, "I personally see them come hand in hand, thwarting tax evasion and money laundering go hand in hand with capital controls but stemming a financial crisis by preventing the abandonment of one currency for another also utilises those same capital controls. Saying that you are implementing capital controls for one is a convenient excuse to address the other without rousing suspicion. Essentially wave around money laundering/tax evasion as the excuse for increased capital controls while avoiding admitting that it is actually because governments/banks are doing it to paralyse capital for the next huge bail in when the shit hits the fan.\n\nWhen Cyrprus style bail-ins occur as countries begin defaulting one after another, having a single backbone that can essentially prevent capital from escaping countries where the bail-ins occur will be invaluable. Plundering tax havens is just common sense when there's nothing left in the coffers, making everyone universally poor means only the governments/banks are in a position of power where they can reset the board according to their liking, since they control all the money. Once all the money is seized and nothing can go in/out, the people are at their mercy.\n\nI'll admit I'm not 100% sold on wikipedia's justifications for capital controls either, but capital controls is a classic way of controlling a country's economic policy, because without them they create uncertainty about the money supply. If money can move in/out without the country's direct intervention and say so, it makes it harder to make policy decisions or lend, but it also means that people can abandon the country's currency en masse just like a run on the bank and countries that are in very poor economic health are the one's most likely to implement such controls to prevent that from happening.\n\nTo see 51+ countries essentially banding together to conspire to control the wealth among their nations (and 30+ more waiting in the wings) is extremely worrying because it indicates that all of them have something to benefit from preventing money leaving their borders. A country with a very healthy economy would welcome money from any country because this will only help bolster economic growth and via foreign investment. Money coming in is easily taxed since it always lands in a bank account under the country's sovereign control, taxing assets only becomes a problem when the money is leaving.

(however you could still trade colored coins for different colored cons!) The actual data structures that correspond to a colored coin proof are pretty much exactly how treechains schemes will (probably!) need to work.\n\nIncidentally, to be clear, colored coins shows how the "exponential blow up" of proofs is often a complete non-issue for a whole class of applications for which treechains is useful. A really easy to understand example of this is bitmessage, for which treechains would give a combination of strong sybil-attack detection and resistance, as well as scalability.\n\n> unfortunately being reasonable isn\'t one of the internet\'s stronger points. maybe the negativity will motivate you some how.\n\nWell, main thing is to not let it get to you; navigating politics is simply a part of my job and I\'ll just have to find ways to out-communicate any negativity.\n\n> i\'ve noticed gavin often mentions that he still doesn\'t understand treechains. is it that he\'s on board with sidechains already or that treechains are a more abstract concept?\n\nI\'m not really sure; I haven\'t personally talked to him about it.

Having a key for continuous re-issuance should be an opt-in, not practical default. And that\'s without getting into the use cases which don\'t involve an obvious candidate to act as issuer, beyond the initial issuance.\n\nSuch a scheme also introduces all sorts of weak points, such as regulatory pressure on the issuer causing de-facto changes in the contract governing the token, e.g. by requiring KYC identification, due to the fact that the issuer needs to be involved in cleaning up histories. Higher-level protocol limits may cause coins to become effectively worthless to people who don\'t wish to comply with the new rules, as the history grows so large as to reach these limits.\n\nFinally, I\'m concerned about any strategy whose implementation path of least resistance does not meet the security design requirements. You say "this can be done entirely offline on a secure machine and easily audited by multiple parties", but in reality we both know that most people won\'t bother with real security, and a frighteningly large number of people will keep issuance keys online on an insecure device like their phone.

Large certainly - on the order of say a few MB to tens of MB of data depending on how you do it - but still feasible. I\'m working on a colored coin library right now for a client, and the problem of proving colored coins exist is essentially the same problem that you have in treechains; my plan is to take that code and port it over to a tree-chains model once it\'s further developed.\n\nI\'ll admit I\'m getting kinda annoyed by how various people on the sidechain team keep repeating this, given I\'ve explained my ideas re: SPV many times over to them.

Bitcoin would essentially become the reserve currency for all other cryptos on the sidechains.  \n\nThe sidechains would be backed by not only Bitcoin's value, but also by Bitcoin's hashing network.

Could single IP address requirement limit this? Or at least make it difficult to get around?\n\nWhen money is involved, you have to assume that somebody will be trying really hard, and even something that\'s "difficult" will get taken advantage of.  If it\'s not technologically *impossible*, it will be exploited, unless there\'s financial incentive against it.  So the two ways to prevent cheating are:  make it impossible via your code (cheating moves are invalid), or make it pay better to be honest than to cheat.  Some combination of those two will need to be underlying every single aspect.\n\nNow some things, like collusion of 7 spots being the same person -- that\'s just not possible to prevent.  Somebody could have multiple computers/VM\'s, each with its own proxy, or multiple people could be in collusion, sharing their cards and strategies over the phone.  It\'s just not something that\'s possible to stop at the technological level.  So for something like that, the best bet is to design good heuristic cheating detection algorithms and have a robust user-rating system, so that things which are red flags for collusion get on a user\'s permanent record.  Stars for example is really good at detecting bots and collusion and chip dumping, purely through algorithms.  For example, I raised 3/4 of my stack on the river in an HU match once and then folded to a shove and the next hand I got captcha\'d.  I had been a regular for years at that time and had not been captcha\'d once.\n\nSo if the setup includes a rating system, and there are cheating detection plugins for the software which automatically send ratings in the background if they find something odd, that is to me "good enough" and also about the most you can do.  Additionally, you could make ratings cost some small amount in order to prevent ratings spam, or cost slightly more if you\'ve lost X big blinds to that player in the last Y time, in order to mitigate "spite" ratings.\n\nIn a central setup like Stars, where they require identity information and bank account info, they can block a user and it\'s a pretty big pain for that guy to find a way to keep playing.  But in a decentralized setup where anybody can join and there\'s no identity, any user can create a new account on a whim.  That\'s why while a rating system might not be strictly necessary for a distributed poker system to work, it IS necessary for the poker community to trust it and use it.  The rating system is the catch-all for misc problems that centralization usually solves, like outing/blocking cheaters.  Combined with well-programmed algorithms developed by the community, the general security of a distributed system could easily be greater than something like Stars could ever hope to have.\n\n> Are there ways around disconnections. If there is a player with an active seat and active hand, their address could bring them back to the table quickly? After proving they own the address by signing a transaction? And within the countdown before they forfeit the hand? \n\nThe idea of a disconnect is that the person has *lost their internet connection* for some long period of time, up to even a few days.  They simply cannot access to internet to do anything.\n\nThat doesn\'t happen *often* but it DOES happen and it needs to be accounted for, so that the game for the other players isn\'t completely distrupted, and also so that the disconnected player isn\'t screwed out of any more than he needs to be.\n\nAnd again, because this isn\'t a centralized system, we have to assume the maximum threat of cheating attempts.  So for example, a disconnect solution needs to protect the one lone honest player who disconnects while at a table of colluders and thieves.  Either via programming or via economic incentive.\n\n> And wihtout actually connecting the game they are playing in it through the blockchain/sidechains etc.\n\nDue to the short amount of time involved in acting in a poker hand, it\'s likely that they would need to be connecting to the other players at the table, it\'s just they would also be connected to other nodes they aren\'t playing with.  I imagine something where the table is passing around signed actions that make up a hand history, passing amongst themselves and then submitting completed hands to the table-instance sidechain, paid for by a portion of rake going to miner fees, (and they could also be mining), and then at some regular interval or when a player "quits" he sends out a request that those hands be "officially committed" by cashing out the money back into the main chain, and once that\'s done, it can\'t be undone and the table-instance chain and the hand history files can be purged/pruned from everybody\'s database (except yours, assuming you want to keep your own HH files).  And both table chain and main chain mining can be paid for via rake, which could still be significantly lower than any rake on any other site currently is, and since the player base are the ones mining, the rake doesn\'t leave the poker economy.\n\n> Can\'t wait to see what you come up with.\n\nThanks for the kind words!': 1, "that's not really the problem you think it is.  7 to 1 is perfectly fair if you get paid more than 7 to 1 on your money.  equity is all that matters.  the only real edge in that scenario is knowledge of the other cards, which certainly isn't nothing...\n\nbut it's also something that can't be prevented in a centralized scenario.\n\nso the centralized solution -- heuristic cheating detection algorithms -- can also easily be applied on individual software that runs as part of a decentralized poker program.": 1, 'They have, its called heads up poker. 1 v 1, no collusion possible.

Also for Pot Limit Omaha this vulnerability is much worse than in Texas Holdem.  It may be not be worth it/not profitable to try this collusion tactic in Texas Holdem.\n\nAlso it is worth noting that this issue would not matter much for tournament games, especially larger tournaments.  Even single table tournament sit and go's would be very difficult to exploit with this method.  Double or Nothing tournaments would be more vulnerable.  But as more tables are added to a tournament, this issue becomes less worrisome.\n\nAlso there could be some sort of web of trust to keep players in check.  Even on the current sites, collusion is an issue, but many times it is the community in the 2 + 2 forums that catch the cheaters and colluders.": 1, 'Yes please, \n\nThe problem is the US govt will shut you down,\nSatoshiDice have stopped taking US customers for this very reason.\n\nOf course people can proxy and all that but your market will be limited and you will always run the risk of seizure.

I think I\'ve got most of the kinks worked out, and sidechains can do some things even more efficiently.\n\nThe big problem is when the other people collude-- not in cards, not normal collusion -- but in transaction collusion.  The key to solving that is that the valid hand is the longest chain of signed actions in that hand -- but then you still run into problems with disconnections and other stuff.  You can also partially mitigate cheating attempts by having the entire table burn more than they sit at the table with in an nLockTime tx that can only be double spent by the current hand -- but again, you don\'t want a disconnect to then cost the table all their money.\n\nI\'m going to keep rambling if I don\'t wrap it up, but suffice it to say, there\'s a lot of kinks to get through, but there\'s a number of ways to solve each of them, and I think I\'ve got a framework that addresses every issue in my head somewhere, but I haven\'t written it out yet.\n\nOnce I progress a bit further in my learning Python, I will write a pseudo white paper just for an outline to follow for coding.\n\nMost of the seemingly interesting problems like proving the deck was fair without knowing the cards ahead of time, have already been solved.  It\'s the nitty gritty of the details of the hand that are the most annoying from my thought experiments at least.  My general approach is an "everything is a transaction" approach, (with modularity in mind), with a main chain processing non-hand money movements and game type tx\'s and WoT ratings, and then a table-instance side-chain since hand actions need to be near instant, and then you also don\'t want to have entire hand history files clogging up the main chain, so they can get pruned once the table side-chain pays out back into the main chain.': 2}, ('What is bitcoin?

Imagine that one of them is evil, and records who deposited and withdrew each bitcoin. Poof, anonymity is gone.\n\nSo I decide to make a completely new type of Bitcoin mixer, that *can't* track my users in this way. How? That's where the maths comes in. Users still send transactions in the normal way, but we don't keep any kind of user account anymore. Now, when they want to withdraw, they send me a proof that they transferred some bitcoins to me, and that the transaction hasn't yet been redeemed. What's special about this proof is that it doesn't tell me anything about which bitcoins were sent. All I know is that the person requesting bitcoins has sent me at least that many, and that I haven't paid out on those bitcoins yet, whichever they are.\n\nNow I just send bitcoins to whatever address the user specifies, and add the proof to my records. I can never link any particular deposit and withdrawal, and it's easy to prove this to my users. Everyone starts using my mixer and I get rich quick.\n\nWith me so far? Here's the kicker. What I'm doing *doesn't require any secret information*. I can publish every computation I make on the open Internet, and no-one can use that to trace transactions. They learn that a mixer was used by certain addresses, but that's it.\n\nNow, because no secret information is required, anyone can verify that I'm running my mixer properly. But this means that my service can now be decentralized. Just take the computations I'm running and make them part of the Bitcoin protocol. Now anyone can use special transactions to 'deposit' bitcoins - with no-one in particular - and 'withdraw' them to different addresses.\n\nThat is what this stuff is about - anonymity built right into the blockchain, provably unbreakable and impossible to undermine.\n\nHowever, there's a catch. The way we know how to do this right now uses ZK SNARK maths. When you use that, you have to do some set-up, using a secret. If you know the secret, you can pretend to have as many coins as you want. You only ever need to use the secret once, but no-one can ever know what it is. That means that whoever starts the decentralized mixer has to be honest. But the returns on being dishonest are staggering - it's free money, whenever you want it, and no-one can tell you're doing it. Imagine a magic portal that spits out gold bars and you've got the idea.\n\nHow do you solve this problem? By making it very hard to cheat, and picking people who we all believe would never cheat.

Once this is done, then their pool (or their own client if they are solo-mining which is unlikely) will "Publish the block" with the checksum - and this block contains all of the transactions received by that peer since the last block was found.\n\n> How are transactions done?\n\nThey are submitted across the peer to peer network of bitcoin nodes, where each wallet is connected to a few other wallets, and then they are in turn connected to more wallets - so the transaction "traverses" the peer2peer network and is sent to all open wallets.  These transactions go into a temporary list called the "mempool" which all nodes have - it is this "mempool" that is then used to create a block.\n\nOffline wallets when they start up in their "sync" phase, contact these peers to obtain all of the blocks that have been found since they were last operational, Check that the blocks are valid (eg that the checksum thing above matches the difficulty, amongst other things). \n\n> If it doesn\'t keep records of wallets, how does it know what ID\'s are avalable?\n\nAll IDs are available. The blockchain contains a record of Unspent Transaction Outputs - each Transaction has a Transaction ID - and they are chained together. \n\nThe wallet itself is more like a key-chain - it contains a collection of "keys" to be able to spend these Unspent Transactions.
