The one thing I think you\'re overlooking is that inflation is almost always primarily a wage phenomena.  I.e. wages rise with inflation (almost always).  The losers are people with dollar assets (including the holders of debt of governments and individuals).  The winners are people who owe dollar assets (net debtors, or levered institutions that effectively borrow at a fixed rate and invest at floating.)\n\nIt\'s very tough for the printing of money to reduce real wages (where "real" means after inflation), since real wages are determined by the worker\'s marginal productivity.  Unless the money printing actually destroys national productivity, real wages should be relatively unchanged, meaning that nominal wages must rise with inflation.': 1, 'and here is the essay from nick szabo that explains why:\n\nhttp://unenumerated.blogspot.com.au/2016/02/two-malthusian-scares.html\n\n': 1, 'Also without inflation theft creating a 0.1% dominant "class", labour traded has more direct connection to other forms of labour.': 2, "You mean burning tons of fossil fuels to secure the block chain is better than using ink and paper?\n\nCommodities aren't money anymore": 1, "So let's start nice and slow. \n\nFirst are you of the delusion that expanding money supply does anything at all to economy?  If so, we need not go further. Money plays an important economic intermediary, but once present, adding units does not change its aggregate economic utility, only its price. Agreed?\n\nIf so, then you will have to agree that a new unit of money has the same value of each of the existing units. They are quite fungible.  The new unit is acquired by its issuer at near zero cost. \n\nSince adding the unit does not change the economic value of the aggregate pool of money, it must therefore decrement its own value from the existing units.  \n\nSo whomever gets ownership of this new unit has been enriched by exactly the new value of the units post addition.  \n\nThe owners of the other units have been impoverished in aggregate by the same amount.  \n\nThis is theft straight up but that's besides this point.  \n\nSo who bears this theft?  The people who own some of the existing units and, the people who will be paid in future of said units. So you say this is those with lots of money, which seems to make sense but does not.  People who have lots of wealth hold most of it in money substitutes. People who have no money must earn it and they slip back on the wage inflation hamster wheel with every new unit printed. People in between will have mixed scenarios but most will lose a good proportion of their wealth to inflation.  \n\nSo that's who loses, but more importantly who gains? Who gets ownership of these new units?

But in reality there will still be miners mining the old chain.  In fact, there could just as easily be an algo change and difficulty change for the old chain that would allow ordinary individuals to again begin mining with little cost to themselves.\n\nIn that scenario you have two chains.  The old chain has always had the established market value and the new one has not.  If you hold your own keys, you have value on either chain.   But if an exchange holds your coins you only have access to your coins on both chains if they support both chains.\n\nSo for instance, it seems Coinbase will only support the ClassicCoinChain, which has never had a market value.  Does this mean that they just keep the value behind the CoreCoinChain, which has always had a market value?\n\nIn reality, there would likely be no algo shift.  Instead, there would be a few miners who still choose to mine the CoinChain that has the established market value.  When there is a fork, there then becomes two mined chains.  Most exchanges will continue to support the chain they always have supported and would have to add support for the new chain.  Then, if the market does not quickly abandon the chain it has always valued, the miners on the new chain would have an oh-shit-moment and switch back to mining on the chain that has value.\n\nMore realistic is that the market will be so confused that both chains have a combined value of way less than $400.\n\nThe way I could see this working is only if all the exchanges, all online wallets, all miners, and most market participants all agreed to ignore the old chain and let it die and in concert treat the new chain as the old.  Then value could just sort of be tricked into adopting the new chain.  But if there are market participants who want the old chain, some exchanges will support it and it will continue to have value.  In fact, in that scenario, it will be the chain that has always had value.\n\nThis would be one hell of a clusterfuck.\n": 1, "Do people realize this?\n\nIf it were not for people using exchanges (which requires storing on exchanges) then Bitcoin would not have much value.\n\nBecause exchanges don't want people to pull their funds off, it seems most would support both (except maybe Coinbase).\n\nCoreCoin already has an established market value.  If the exchanges are running both chains why will the value shift completely from  CoreCoin to ClassicCoin?\n\nIf it does not happen very quickly, then won't 75% of the miners be mining coins on a chain that has no value (or much less than the other)?  If so, won't many of them shift back?\n\nBut, maybe they won't shift back.  Maybe instead of the market giving Classic value, it just gets spooked and gives neither coin much value.  In that case, it seems much of the hash power dies off altogether for a while and comes back slowly to the two different chains as the market values of each compete with one another for miner support.\n\nSeems like one hell of a clusterfuck.  The only way to prevent this is if all the exchanges agree that upon a hard fork they will not support the exchange of CoreCoins, but will send CoreCoins to their customers upon request.\n\nWhen the new chain comes on it is important that the market value for the old chain also die.  How do you make this happen without market consensus?  Is it really enough for only 75% of miners to agree?\n\nIf the market for the old chain does not die, then there can be one hell of a shit show.": 2, "I concur.\n\nI don't actually think a fork is imminent.

What a clusterfuck.\n\nI don't think it's going to take much longer for the miners to realize that they don't have the influence they thought.  All the lobbying makes them seem important, but the truth is, one side is lobbying them only because if they do this it will hurt Bitcoin badly (which is against their interest).  Once they figure out that it could (likely would) devastate their interest, they realize that they are powerless without the market shifting first and in concert.\n\nThis is good stuff.  However, it does kindof suck to realize that a fork to ever adjust the block cap may be practically impossible.  It would be nice to ultimately have some sort of automatically adjusting cap.

The longest chain can\'t really be about choosing between two equally long but sent-at-the-same-time blocks, now can it?\n\nLet me save you the trouble of looking it up;\n> Nodes always consider the longest chain to be the correct one and will keep working on\nextending it. If two nodes broadcast different versions of the next block simultaneously, some\nnodes may receive one or the other first. In that case, they work on the first one they received,\nbut save the other branch in case it becomes longer. The tie will be broken when the next proof-\nof-work is found and one branch becomes longer\n': 0, 'If an Exchange is holding your coins for you, it\'s up to them what they do.\n\nDon\'t keep your coins on an exchange, especially not one that says that only one side of a fork is the "true" Bitcoin, they might not honor your other side coins balance.': 6, "I don't think this their plan.  I think Brian Armstrong has a sincerely held (but not fully considered) belief that the Core chain will cease to have a market value.  I don't think he has a plan for what to do if both chains have value (much less if the Core chain had higher value).\n\nI suspect what he will do is spend some time trying to deny the validity of the original chain in hopes of the market devaluing the chain completely.  I don't think he would sell them on another exchange.  But I do suspect it will be difficult to get your coins.\n\nI guess he could say that all he owes you is Bitcoins (and ClassicCoin is the only true Bitcoin).  But if he did this and the old chain still had value, he would likely be spending time with Shrem--so I doubt he would.  Who knows though?  He's a loose cannon.": 2, "Agree. But the thing is that it comes down to the same thing, as you already allude to.\n\nIf they haven't prepared for 2 separate chains when the fork happens, they will have to shut down the whole exchange until they fix their shit. Of course they won't do that, so they will quickly start losing either Bitcoins or classiccoins because people will deposit only one and withdraw both. That can't last very long either. People will start losing coins and will rightfully blame Coinbase.\n\nIt doesn't matter whether Brian steals them personally or his coins trickle away because he can't untangle the coins properly and others take advantage of that.\n\nThis is a huge reason why the whole contentious HF is so dangerous (besides all the normal dangers). It simply means that ALL exchanges and ALL merchants need to be prepared to accept both coins (or consciously reject one). But rejecting is not simple because someone will make a transaction with both coins and then demand back their Bitcoins accusing the exchange/merchant of stealing if he doesn't cooperate.\n\nFor this reason alone the fast rollout and then 28 days activation time is criminally insane. Also the argument that SPV wallets will be unaffected is a complete lie.\n\nThe whole classic charade is banked on mob rule quickly pushing out and shutting up the minority, handwaving away any problems. Simply criminal.": 1, ">Miners solely control the chain market.\n\nNo they don't.\n\n>It is in their best interest to also go with the best ROI.\n\nI'll agree.  But long-term considerations can come into the decision, rather than just myopically considering the next block.  So suppose that 75% agree to fork and 25% continue to mine the chain with a long-established proven market value.  At the moment of fork, do all exchanges just abandon the chain they have supported for years and pretend the new chain is the one true chain?  Or do they add support for the new chain and let the market decide how to value them?  What if some exchanges just keep supporting the old chain, but not the new?\n\nYou will have some exchanges whose Bitcoin represents one chain, some whose Bitcoin represents new, and some who have two Bitcoins:  Classic and the classic Bitcoin.  In this scenario, what makes the market all of the sudden shift to the new chain?  If it does not suddenly shift, then won't Classic miners just shift back, realizing their miscalculation through loss of ROI?\n\nBut then in that scenario, won't there still be some who continue to mine Classic (for principle and in hopes of long-term value)?  If so, won't that chain also continue to have a market value?  If your exchange does not support Classic, but holds the keys that work on either chain, do they get to keep your value on the Classic Chain?\n\nIt seems the only way for exchanges to properly deal with this is to support both chains.  But if they do that, then the market will schism when we need the market to simultaneously make a wholesale shift.": 2, "> But in reality there will still be miners mining the old chain. \n\nThats a huge assumption you are making there, maybe you are willing to explain that one as it makes no sense to me.  Why would you waste your energy mining something that has such a ludicrous difficulty that you won't get a block for a days or weeks.\n\n> The way I could see this working is only if all the exchanges, all online wallets, all miners, and most market participants all agreed to ignore the old chain and let it die\n\nIf you read the whitepaper it explains that this is exactly what should happen. The longest chain 'wins'.": 1, "As you kinda sorta said, the miners are mostly beholden to ROI.  So the actual market greatly influences what miners will do.  Most will do what they perceive the market wants (which is mine Bitcoins).\n\nBut they have never had to do much in depth analysis of what the market really wants; they just mine those Bitcoins.  In this case they are being lobbied and lead to believe that if they start mining something else, the market will continue to reward them.  But that's not something anyone can guarantee the miners.  The same group that lobbies the miners to change seems not to be persuasive to the market.  In this case there could easily be a misperception by the miners that the market wants new coin.  When they discover their error they will either switch back (or quit altogether as the market for both has been destroyed by confusion).": 2, "Source?  The only one I know of was the one in 2013 that **had complete agreement**--there was an error that created lots of fake coins in the chain.  Ironically, it was caused by Hearn.\n\nIn this instance, there are plenty who don't want to fork.  But a few miners could do it anyway.  25% may keep mining the original chain.\n\nIn that case you have two chains.  Some exchanges could run the new chain exclusively.  Some could run the old exclusively.  It seems most would support both.  How do you get the market to shift from the old chain to the new?\n\nIf all exchanges and market participants were in agreement to value only the new chain, then I could see miners being forced (by getting a reward of zero value) to quit mining the old chain.  But here, instead of the market necessarily deciding to value a new chain, it seems that miners (75%) would be choosing to mine a chain the market has not agreed to value.": 1, 'I was once told the best way to get good data from reddit was to post something in error.

There isn\'t a "real" one, but with proof of work embedded into the hashes, there is an *objective* measurement of which version of history is "most real" - it\'s the one that\'s hardest to reproduce. (A useful intuition here - what makes digital things digital (apart from the obvious 0s and 1s) is the fact they\'re infinitely replicable at low cost - now you can see how dubious (even stupid) it is to call Bitcoin "virtual currency").': 20, 'If you hard code a "wait" that does nothing to stop someone from pre computing the next 100 blocks, and if they can do that they can pre compute them all...': 1, "Hardcoding a time delay would be easy to bypass.

If they set their miner to have a time 10 minutes in the future they would continually find blocks even without tampering with the code.  As Einstein would say, time is relative.  \n\nForcing a delay, by requiring a certain amount of 'work' between blocks, keeps everyone honest.

That means on average, someone will find the pass code every one minute if there\'s just 3 people on the network.\n\nNow lets say another 30 people join the network. If it stayed at the current difficulty (a pass code 4 digits long) it would mean that you have 10x the guessing power so you\'d guess the pass code 10x quicker, which would mean a block is submitted every 6~ seconds, which is too quick. It needs to be submitted every one minute, else you\'re potentially risking more complications. So what the network does, is agree that the pass code is now 5 digits long, meaning there\'s 10,000 different combinations which will average 1 block being found every minute with 33 people.\n\nAs more people join the network, the software is working out on average how quickly blocks are being submitted.

If they\'re being submitted too slowly, the network reduces the size of the pass code.': 2, 'Good point, thanks. \n\nIt was just a brief thought, reminded me of the sci-fi concept of a civilisation sending out faster and faster spaceships as technology develops such that the first ones sent out actually arrive last.

Two parties with polar opposite views (conservatives and greens) are teaming up to 'reform' one of our voting systems which also happens to screw most minor parties over.

Legislation to push through their reforms hasn't been finalized, but might drop in the near future.

So maybe we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be surprised that politicians and central bankers are now waging a war on cash. That\xe2\x80\x99s right, policy makers in Europe and the U.S. want to make it harder for the hoi polloi to hold actual currency.\n\nMario Draghi fired the latest salvo on Monday when he said the European Central Bank would like to ban \xe2\x82\xac500 notes. A day later Harvard economist and Democratic Party favorite Larry Summers declared that it\xe2\x80\x99s time to kill the $100 bill, which would mean goodbye to Ben Franklin. Alexander Hamilton may soon\xe2\x80\x94and shamefully\xe2\x80\x94be replaced on the $10 bill, but at least the 10-spots would exist for a while longer. Ol\xe2\x80\x99 Ben would be banished from the currency the way dead white males like him are banned from the history books.\n\nLimits on cash transactions have been spreading in Europe since the 2008 financial panic, ostensibly to crack down on crime and tax avoidance. Italy has made it illegal to pay cash for anything worth more than \xe2\x82\xac1,000 ($1,116), while France cut its limit to \xe2\x82\xac1,000 from \xe2\x82\xac3,000 last year. British merchants accepting more than \xe2\x82\xac15,000 in cash per transaction must first register with the tax authorities. Fines for violators can run into the thousands of euros. Germany\xe2\x80\x99s Deputy Finance Minister Michael Meister recently proposed a \xe2\x82\xac5,000 cap on cash transactions. Deutsche Bank CEO John Cryan predicted last month that cash won\xe2\x80\x99t survive another decade.\n\nThe enemies of cash claim that only crooks and cranks need large-denomination bills. They want large transactions to be made electronically so government can follow them. Yet these are some of the same European politicians who blew a gasket when they learned that U.S. counterterrorist officials were monitoring money through the Swift global system. Criminals will find a way, large bills or not.\n\nThe real reason the war on cash is gearing up now is political: Politicians and central bankers fear that holders of currency could undermine their brave new monetary world of negative interest rates. Japan and Europe are already deep into negative territory, and U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen said last week the U.S. should be prepared for the possibility. Translation: That\xe2\x80\x99s where the Fed is going in the next recession.\n\nNegative rates are a tax on deposits with banks, with the goal of prodding depositors to remove their cash and spend it to increase economic demand. But that goal will be undermined if citizens hoard cash. And hoarding cash is easier if you can take your deposits out in large-denomination bills you can stick in a safe. It\xe2\x80\x99s harder to keep cash if you can only hold small bills.\n\nSo, presto, ban cash. This theme has been pushed by the likes of Bank of England chief economist Andrew Haldane and Harvard\xe2\x80\x99s Kenneth Rogoff, who wrote in the Financial Times that eliminating paper currency would be \xe2\x80\x9cby far the simplest\xe2\x80\x9d way to \xe2\x80\x9cget around\xe2\x80\x9d the zero interest-rate bound \xe2\x80\x9cthat has handcuffed central banks since the financial crisis.\xe2\x80\x9d If the benighted peasants won\xe2\x80\x99t spend on their own, well, make it that much harder for them to save money even in their own mattresses.\n\nAll of which ignores the virtues of cash for law-abiding citizens. Cash allows legitimate transactions to be executed quickly, without either party paying fees to a bank or credit-card processor. Cash also lets millions of low-income people participate in the economy without maintaining a bank account, the costs of which are mounting as post-2008 regulations drop the ax on fee-free retail banking. While there\xe2\x80\x99s always a risk of being mugged on the way to the store, digital transactions are subject to hacking and computer theft.\n\nCash is also the currency of gray markets\xe2\x80\x94amounting to 20% or more of gross domestic product in some European countries\xe2\x80\x94that governments would love to tax. But the reason gray markets exist is because high taxes and regulatory costs drive otherwise honest businesses off the books. Politicians may want to think twice about cracking down on the cash economy in a way that might destroy businesses and add millions to the jobless rolls. The Italian economy might shut down without cash.\n\nBy all means people should be able to go cashless if they like. But it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to avoid the conclusion that the politicians want to bar cash as one more infringement on economic liberty. They may go after the big bills now, but does anyone think they\xe2\x80\x99d stop there? Why wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t they eventually ban all cash transactions much as they banned gold and silver as mediums of exchange?\n\nBeware politicians trying to limit the ways you can conduct private economic business.

To solve these problems and make blockchain ready for business, the OBC team has been researching several approaches to improve the existing algorithms.\n\n>One such improvement is \xe2\x80\x9cSIEVE\xe2\x80\x9d, a consensus algorithm inspired by classic PBFT [Castro and Liskov, OSDI\xe2\x80\x9999] and the Eve consensus protocol [Kapritsos et al., OSDI\xe2\x80\x992012].\n\n>In short, SIEVE augments the original PBFT algorithm by adding speculative execution and verification phases to: 1) detect and filter out possible non-deterministic requests and establish the determinism of transactions entering the PBFT 3-phase agreement protocol, and **2) allow consensus to be run on output state of validators, in addition to the consensus on their input state offered by Classic PBFT.** SIEVE is derived from PBFT in a modular way (inspired by ideas described in [Aublin et al., TOCS\'15]) by reusing the PBFT view-change protocol to lower its complexity and avoid implementing a new consensus protocol from scratch.\n\n>**A research paper will be published by IBM Research to describe this new algorithm in further detail, and we will continue to make further research investments in the subject and share our results with the OBC community.**\n\n\nAka - they don\'t really know if it will work.
