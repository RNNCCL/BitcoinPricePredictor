If only Gmail had automatically encrypted all gmail-to-gmail emails with PGP; had the standard caught on, we\'d be looking at a very different PGP and a very different email experience. Specifically, the state of modern PGP user experience wouldn\'t be that of Geocities circa 1999.\n\nBe willing to stand strong for what is right for the common man. That\'s what we care about, Gavin. That\'s what we\'re here for. Personally I have my doubts, because I **know** what happens inside of people\'s psyche when they are staring down the barrel of a gun. No offense to the core Bitcoin developers but I strongly doubt they are capable of doing the right thing as the pressure from global authorities becomes ever-higher to turn Bitcoin into a yet-another surveillance haven.\n\nThink about how easy it is to avoid that fate. Take Tor browser bundle for example. Here we have a clear cut, PROVEN way for the common man to opt out of global suspicionless surveillance online. Sure, it\'s not perfect, but if hundreds of millions of people used Tor browser all over the world to browse the Web, we could very easily return to a world with real freedom of speech and freedom of assocation online.\n\nAnd who has the power to make that world a reality? Anyone who is in a position to bundle Tor browser with their major operating system. Microsoft has that power. Google and Apple do too. Humanity really can pull itself out of the rut its in, if only the authorities at the top of these organizations are willing to *do what\'s right*.\n\nEvery core developer of Bitcoin HAS that level of authority over Bitcoin\'s userbase, which for all we know is still growing strong.

If we ever want to have privacy in Bitcoin, now is the time to implement it.  Once more regulation is enacted, and more pressure is brought to bear by corporate and media interests, it will become either enormously difficult or outright impossible to add privacy afterwards.  But if we begin the process *now*, it will be fine.  It needn't be perfect at first.  And, as new core-devs come onboard, they can improve it.\n\n\n* Furthermore, it\xe2\x80\x99s a certainty that at some point, some government(s) will have an enormous incentive to break bitcoin\xe2\x80\x99s fungibility.  There will be morally and ethically compelling reasons to do so, (accompanied by subpoenas and warrants).  But doing so will destroy bitcoin, as a currency.  Meaningful privacy is critical in protecting the currency of Bitcoin.  (And guides prosecutors\xe2\x80\x94for example\xe2\x80\x94to focus their investigations on the actual crime that was committed, not they way in which that crime was funded or rewarded.  Just an example.)\n\n\n* Lastly, a government breaking fungibility, such as by whitelisting or blacklisting certain coins, will threaten the decentralised nature of Bitcoin itself.  They who control the blacklist, control the coin.  Meaningful privacy is the solution to this.\n\n\n* I know I\xe2\x80\x99ve stated several lofty and unsubstantiated assertions here.

Zerocash would be a separate currency technically speaking, but buying and selling Zerocash would happen on the same blockchain in exchange for Bitcoins in a fully decentralized and secure way. Should the technology prove its worth it can be added to the Bitcoin protocol later, which has some technical advantages. (and disadvantages) If it doesn\'t, then no harm done. If the implementation needs upgrading, the only users who need to upgrade are those using that implementation of Zerocash. If there are multiple competing groups with different ideas for how Zerocash should work, they can all try out their ideas without asking permission from "core devs" or miners.\n\ntl;dr: What Gavin, any other "core dev", or even miners think about a particular technology doesn\'t need stop you from implementing it, even in production.': 30, '>Note that none of those technologies need to be added to the Bitcoin protocol directly to be deployed.\n\nExactly.

Your coins are far less likely to be confiscated under duress if transactions are truly anonymous. Plausible deniability is dandy, but I'd rather not put it to the test in some cold interrogation room. We should strive for pure financial privacy, and that requires anonymous transactions.\n\nI consider anonymity to be a tenet free speech as well. Without the ability to conceal one's identity to a certain degree, we will often censor ourselves for a variety of reasons. This self-censorship has only increased now that we understand the magnitude of government surveillance. Communicating anonymously is even more crucial in periods of political instability where radical thinkers are most often persecuted.\n\nThat being said, Bitcoin must walk a very fine line to avoid attracting too much scorn from governments.

You keep your backup private key hidden in a safe or in a hole in the ground and it never touches the internet. You sign day-to-day transactions with your primary key then send the transaction to us. After authenticating the request with 2FA and any other rules you have in place (for example geolocation requirements or spending limits) we sign the transaction with the cosigner key and submit it to the network.\n\nThis means that if we get hacked or you get hacked, the hacker only has one key and can\'t do anything, but you retain access to enough keys to rescue your coins. Or  if one of us loses the key for any reason, the money is still accessible. \n\nIt\'s also important and awesome to note that Gem never has enough keys to move your money without your approval but you always can spend your coin without Gem. This is a key (sorry, that pun gets old but we use it in the office all the time!) difference between us and coinbase, for example, as they store your keys for you, even in their optional multi-sig solution "Vault."

It may work if it was specifically targetted towards the escort/prostitution sort of market, but that market has a lot less people compared to the Tinder market.\n\nBut I really like the idea of the interface you describe, flicking through and setting a slider. A better application for such an interface with Bitcoin might be something more trivial in concept and in cost. For example, make the slider represent a bid on something that\'s really cheap and trivial. Maybe even a novel interface for eBay: the user selects a bunch of filters or categories and is presented with brand new just listed eBay auctions, they specify the price with the slider and a bid is placed. \n\nIt might even make a good interface for a cryptocurrency exchange or similar: users are prompted with bid/asks and swipe to accept/decline or swipe a slider to make a bid on a particular off. (e.g. seller lists "100BTC - 10 minutes" and the 100BTC offer is shown to other users for 10 minutes and other users move the slider to specify how much they bid and of what currency or similar).': 1, "Well, it could be made as well with traditional credit cards. However no credit card company would allow you to build that kind of thing.

With the traditional escort model, it\'s pretty clear that one person is the service provider and the other is the consumer, and the price reflects that. The benefit of the Tinder model/interface is that it puts both parties on the same level (I assume, I only know of Tinder what I\'ve seen in the news).\n\nI just feel that it would naturally just devolve into a bunch of people paying a certain price for sex from anyone, and a bunch of people who charge a certain price for sex from anyone, which kind of negates the benefit of Tinder.\n\nAlthough the interface you describe would allow people to sell sex who otherwise wouldn\'t sell sex because they want to be selective - although you\'d have to have the option for people to say along the lines of "there isn\'t enough money on this planet for me to sleep with *that*".\n\nAnother way to do the tradition escort market (e.g. some people saying "I want sex with anyone and I\'ll pay up to x" and other saying "I\'ll have sex with anyone if they pay me x") would be users specify how much the want to pay/are charging to start, and then it proceeds to be just like tinder, but presented options are filtered only to include those in the acceptable price range.\n\nI mean, I\'m not saying such a service *wouldn\'t* work, but it would definitely be very very different from the existing uses of the concepts involved and thus a pretty risky endeavour. In all honesty, that in itself could be a reason for it to succeed though.\n': 1, 'Valid question. It is the oldest trade in the book re-innovated to improve liquidity in the match-making market.

It wouldn't necessarily mean prostitution, just paid company.": 1, "I think you didn't understand the model perfectly, no women would probably need to pay for this service - they would MAKE money.

For localbitcoins it took about a year for it to start making money, and it has been profitable after january 2013 (and of course at the beginning not many people believed in the service or business model at all). Because we also utilize the escrow model, I think it is viable and I also can estimate somewhat how this kind of service would work.\n\nI'm very busy at my current job at localbitcoins, but I think this service idea is good so I wrote it down here for others to get inspiration from. I think developing really basic MPV would start from 2 weeks to 1 month from me + some freelancers from elance. The development time of course varies depending who is doing the work etc.\n\nOn localbitcoins our escrow fee is 1%, on this kind of service the fee could be easily something like 15%, since the service itself adds much more value. Also you could compare the prices to local escort services.\n\nServer costs are at the beginning very small, since you don't need much capacity to handle the miniscule amount of users. The good thing is that the revenues grow (hopefully) with users, so you should have money to invest in the service when the userbase grows.\n\nI would guess this kind of service could start making money in about 2 years. It is not sensible to calculate ROI for this kind of project IMHO, however it could be explosive if executed succesfully.\n\nThe most tricky part would be marketing. I think at beginning 1) look at area, where bitcoin is used most 2) try to employ local escorts to use the service. I think bootstrapping the idea would require you to be escort yourself and sell using the service, or some good connections.": 1, 'Well, maybe the idea is not meant to be "good for bitcoin", but to generate revenue for the business operator and also make escort services more accessible and available.': 1, 'Well, whatever the participants decide to do is not dictated by the service.
