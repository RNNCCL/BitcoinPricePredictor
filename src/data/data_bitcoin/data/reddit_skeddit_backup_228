Depending on timing you might have $9k capital gains losses in the first year, but then made $9k gains in the second. You need to report the $9k loss, since it will reduce your tax burden that year.

As I understand it, in US law we are generally offered a plea deal which defines our punishment but taking it or not taking it is a positive or negative crap shoot.  Prosecutors do use language like "you never know what the judge may decide, he may be having a bad day" if you lean toward your right for a trial.  Different degrees of that kind of language can feel like a threat and to an extent it is. That is likely what he was expressing with "It depends on how you define "threaten,"" so in my eyes that\'s not a lie.\n\nPerhaps in Europe that kind of "explosive" is scary but we shoot things like that off all the time from practically the time we can run.  The fact that he was sleeping next to them is a testament to his mentality and that he likely was not considering it to be a real threat.  Had he asked a friend to store it for him without telling him what it was then that would be different.  Does this make it OK?  No, but it\'s hardly as extreme as you seem to want to characterize it.

The fact still remains though they were likely on a plane at one point which is against FAA rules (even for basic fireworks) and planes are super thin and full of other things that can cause an issue. They might not be that dangerous on their own but its the effect that could potentially happen from being mildly annoying to downing the whole thing.

Let\'s be more realistic.\n\nNo I am not. The damage explosives cause in the real world is not the big balls of fire you see in the movies but the overpressure caused in the air. Now an apartment complex is different to a house in construction methods but many U.S buildings seem pretty flimsy to my European eyes. \n\nIf it was a wood,stud,drywall type construction chances are it would blow through things. I honestly don\'t know what the apartment is likely to be made of but i will say bricks and mortar. Still when you create overpressure in a confined space it has to go somewhere. It could have blown out the window, it could have blown out the floor above, who knows? Secondry fires and structural damage could have been an issue. They could have gone off through no fault of his own, say the neighbor sets light to there sheets or something smoking, an unexpected boom is not what firefighters need.\n\nIf we were talking about an industrial unit somewhere it would be a totally different conversation (and he probably would have a much lighter sentance) but it was residential and he endangered those around him.\n\n> Let\'s leave the exaggerations out of it.\n\nI used to work at a store that sold Fireworks for bonfire night (nov 5th). Now this iis in the UK and the only fireworks a non specialist place can sell are tiny in comparison to what Ver was selling and what you can buy in America where legal. We still were required by law to have a thick metal storage trunk with blowout flaps that was locked at all times (it might have been bolted to the floor, can\'t remember) and have it checked by the fire department. \n\nVer stuck much more power then that next to his bed in a normal cardboard box. Like i said it could have been nothing to do with him that could have caused them to go off.\n\n> You don\'t like Ver - fine. Let the judgement and punishment fit the crime.\n\nHe has done his time for it and that should be enough. However he has chosen to lie about many facts around the trial to play to the crowd that were dis-proven when the publicly available court records were posted.\n\n[Here is a photo of what he was selling posted by Ver himself](http://imgur.com/a/SaIsH) The box clearly states "Warning explosives" and "Store in a secure area". The article (again posted by Ver states they were 20 times over the legal limit allowed and therefore explosives not fireworks plus it is written on them explosives and on the box.\n\n[Here is an article where Ver clearly is lieing to make himself seem a martyr](http://voluntaryist.com/howibecame/rogerver.html). The relevant section\'s:\n\nIt says:\n\nAt the sentencing the judge asked me if anyone threatened or coerced me in any way to sign the plea agreement. When I said \xe2\x80\x9cYes, absolutely,\xe2\x80\x9d the judge\xe2\x80\x99s eyes became very wide and he asked \xe2\x80\x9cwhat do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nWhat actually happened:\n\nTHE COURT: And has anyone threatened you in any way in order to cause you to plead guilty in this case?\n\nTHE DEFENDANT: It depends on how you define "threaten," but I would say no, Your Honor.\n\nBit of a gap there huh?, also the judge on the case seemed to have no problem with Ver\'s politics:\n\n> "I think even the most die hard libertarian would agree that **one function of government, if there is to be a government, is to protect public safety.
