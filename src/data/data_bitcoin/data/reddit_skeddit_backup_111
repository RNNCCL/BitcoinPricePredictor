That is to say, they are our rulers, so to speak, and as such the "government."\n\nTo answer your question: the Fed "prints money" in order to buy debt. Usually that is government debt, but they have extended into buying a variety of different kinds of debt. They don\'t just print money and dump it into the economy, they print money and buy stuff (bonds) with that money. That way, if they ever want to remove money from the economy to combat inflation, they can simply sell the stuff they have bought. When they sell the debt that they previously bought, the buyers of those debts give them money in exchange for those debts. Then the Fed simply burns the money it receives thereby removing it from existence. So the short answer to your question is that if they merely printed money and gave it away, they would increase the money supply, sure, but they would be powerless to decrease the money supply at a future date if they needed to.

As the implication of this gets passed down to the rest of the economy, the net result is that you and I have to pay the bank to hold our money. \n\nOf course, this steady erosion of our money has always existed due to inflation. But in a deflationary environment the banking system, in order to survive, needs to use more drastic measures, e.g., negative interest rates, to recreate the inflation effect which is no longer there due to larger financial and economic forces. \n\nYou see, commercial banks don\'t depend on deposits. It is quite the opposite actually. What you and I consider "money" is for banks actually debt. For banks, real "money" is either other people\'s debts, or central bank reserves. When the bank makes a loan to you, your promise to repay the loan is a financial asset for the bank, that is real money as far as the bank is concerned. The deposits in your bank account, on the other hand, are basically the bank owing you money, they are in debt to you the same way you are in debt to them when you take out a loan. So if, due to deflation, the purchasing power of money is increasing, then the real debts of commercial banks are also increasing. This is why the banking system always requires that money erode in purchasing power, so that their debts are continuously diminished. A deflationary environment is extremely dangerous to banks because not only are people not taking out many new loans, which is how they make "money," but because their liabilities are steadily increasing. \n\nBut, what most people don\'t realize is that in the US, because quantitative easing left commercial banks with more reserves than they could ever possibly need, raising interest rates using the old system where the central bank merely charged commercial banks more to borrow money doesn\'t work. Commercial banks have such an excess of reserves they don\'t really need to borrow often, and even if they do they can simply get cheaper loans from other commercial banks who are themselves sitting on so much excess reserves they will gladly lend at cheaper rates than the Fed\'s target. \n\nSo, in order to get around this, in order to raise interest rates, the Fed is now *paying* interest on commercial banks\' deposits. That way the commercial banks will never lend at a lower rate than they can get by just letting their money sit inside the Fed. In essence, the Fed is paying the bankers not to lend money. \n\nBut here is the kicker. Where is the money coming from that the Fed is paying the commercial banks with? Yes, the Fed can print money, but it prints money in exchange for debt, it has a balance sheet to maintain and in this case it is merely giving money away. So where is the money coming from?\n\nThe answer is that the Fed is paying the banks from its income. Where does the Fed\'s income come from? It comes primarily from the interest on government debt it is holding. This interest is then paid back to the treasury, which is why when the government borrows money from the Fed it is essentially interest free. But now, rather than paying the government with this money, the Fed will be using it to pay commercial banks. \n\nPut simply, the Fed is using tax payer dollars to pay the commercial banks not to lend money. That is how they are raising interest rates now. \n\nSo regardless of whether interest rates go positive or negative, ordinary people are screwed. \n\n ': 2, 'I apologize for not being more articulate in the way I phrased that because I agree with what you are saying.

I\'m not beholden to any particular coin or group of devs, and neither are you, neither are the miners. That\'s the beauty of this experiment. We can individually reason and make up our own minds about our own situation and opinion. It\'s subjective. But declaring the "correctness" of an opinion on the arbitrary fact of it being a majority or minority is fool hardy, and doesn\'t make success more likely. \n\nThe devs are dealing with this now. They are making decisions based on their own reason and what they think is right. No one can expect any more. Their information/situation is different from all others, just like mine is different from yours. That doesn\'t make them right or wrong. They also have peers, other core devs, whose individual situations are closest to theirs and from whom they can get counsel. Their decisions will likely be better as a united group of experts, but they could be wrong. \n\nWe may never know what\'s "right" for bitcoin as a whole, but we can know what\'s right for us individually. That\'s what the miners are doing, that\'s what the traders are doing, that\'s what the users are doing. Making decisions based on their situational input. Bitcoin\'s incentive structure helps, but it\'s still personal opinion. \n\nMaybe this is one reason most open source protocols stop changing after a while and osify, because changing them becomes politically impossible. It also could be peak hash power as miners face the realization that those ASICS actually increase risk of this type of gridlock (they can\'t switch to other coins as easily as users can). \n\n>Doesn\'t do any of us a lick of good.\n\nWhat will?
