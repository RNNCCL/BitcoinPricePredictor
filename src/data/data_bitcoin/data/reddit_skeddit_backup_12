He's raising some good points, but no definitive one that argues bitcoin would be a net evil to the economy.\n\nIt's certain that the last word hasn't been said, and it would behoove us to keep our minds open to the possibility that a fixed money supply may have some major drawbacks we are not being able to predict.": 4, 'He certainly had a choice about whether to lie about it first.': 3, 'So he thinks fighting insolvencies with bailouts is a good thing. Righto.': 1, 'The idea that deflation is a problem is a myth. People continue to buy cell phones and computers, even though they know those goods will be cheaper in a year, because people *get tired of waiting*.\n\nThe idea that too much saving causes recessions is another myth, because it ignores the fact that businesses can adjust prices to meet demand. For example, if everyone decided to cut their spending in half, then businesses could respond by cutting prices in half, and everything evens out.\n\nSo what really causes recessions? Governments create booms by encouraging risky lending, and eventually, these unsustainable booms collapse into recessions. Governments then drag out the recessions by trying to start another boom. In other words, instead of letting the heroin addict go through withdrawal, they just keep giving him stronger doses of heroin, as if the day of reckoning can be postponed indefinitely.\n\nVaroufakis would scoff, of course, and argue that austerity does not work. He would say that governments have no choice but to try to spend their way out of recessions. But his idea of austerity is to raise taxes to pay down the debt. A better plan for austerity is to simply default on the debt, and to start living within your means. Yes, people will lose their jobs and businesses will fail. But if we would simply let that happen, the moral hazards will go away, the reckless lending would stop, and prosperity would return.': 12, 'A lot of people, on both sides of the argument, have the tendency to compare bitcoin to gold. Then rather than discussing the merits of bitcoin, they discuss gold instead. That is what Varoufakis has done. He is really critical of the gold standard, and I think most of his arguments against the gold standard have merit. The problem isn\'t in his critique of the gold standard, the problem is in his naive view of bitcoin that causes him to equate it with gold.\n\nIt is a bit like saying, "Reddit will never work because we already know the world was less informed when everyone communicated through word of mouth."

It just needs to settle all the transactions.  \n\nSo think of the possibilities:  Taylor Swift coins, family name coins, company name coins, Cause du Jour coins, etc.  The coins or tokens are used not only in transactions, but as a means for marketing as well, perhaps as gifts or promotions.  \n\nMany many years ago, and maybe some of the oldsters here will remember, whenever you bought groceries or gas, a bunch of stamps were issued.  We saved the stamps and pasted into books and upon completing the pages of the books we could redeem them for items.  Similarly, tokens or custom coins can be used?\n\n': 3, 'I smell viral applications emerging....': 2, "Your reply doesn't make any sense, mainly because you're high, and partly because I don't want to tell you that you're an incoherent moron.": 2, 'In this instance, the Tokens are using the Counterparty protocol.

Once issued, you can then send some amount of your tokens to any other bitcoin address by again embedding more data, or issue additional units, among a few other features you can do (such as decentralized token exchange).

(Remember: [reversed stupidity is not intelligence](http://lesswrong.com/lw/lw/reversed_stupidity_is_not_intelligence/).) Just because you don\'t understand what [survival analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_analysis) or a [survival curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_curve) is, doesn\'t mean it doesn\'t apply. A [nonparametric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonparametric_statistics) method deals fine with things with complicated distributions such as time-to-failures due to competing risks. Survival analysis is applied fruitfully all throughout medicine, which is far more complicated than security, and has in fact been applied to computer security: you may remember a useful application of it to [Bitcoin exchange lifetimes](http://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-3-642-39884-1_3 "Beware the middleman: Empirical analysis of Bitcoin-exchange risk")  (and by the way, note how that one example satisfies many of the supposed \'counterexamples\' Thor lists like insider attacks. Because Thor didn\'t understand what Wright was talking about in the first place) and I find it highly enlightening in understanding [darknet market lifetimes](http://www.gwern.net/Black-market%20survival), [how often Google shuts down services](http://www.gwern.net/Google%20shutdowns), and many other things.\n\nThor\'s analysis, on the other hand, is like reading about a medical trial and going \'but, like, people are different, how can you reduce *that* to numbers?! My uncle smoked his whole life and died in a car accident. So these doctors are full of it.\' (But funnily enough, it does in fact work.)\n\nSome further reading: https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=%28%22survival+analysis%22+OR+%22survival+curve%22%29++%28%22information+security%22+OR+%22computer+security%22%29&btnG=&hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C21\n\nA *real* critique of Wright\'s application of survival analysis would be something like this: the survival curve cannot be cleanly approximated by a parametric curve (IIRC, it goes something like a Type I + Type III curve but not exactly), so you\'re forced to use the nonparametric methods which come with a lot of downsides to pay for their universality; besides being harder to work with or make predictions with, nonparametric methods require lots of data which is typically not reported in an unbiased fashion, allowing only the simplest inferences with very wide confidence intervals (for example, his Windows vs Linux time-to-compromise experiment\\* is adequately powered because he was only looking at one binary variable, OS, but anything more than that and it\'d be noninformative); other survival security analyses show that the Internet security environment does not respect the proportional hazards risk assumption, so it may be unsafe to throw in a lot of covariates into a Cox regression to try to build a comprehensive model of security to optimize; and Internet security risk definitely is time-varying (think about Microsoft\'s Patch Tuesdays), so you need to do something like the \'crazy clock\' method to incorporate that. So basically: the method works, but he didn\'t check for some common ways in which it can go wrong, and I am skeptical that it would work fast enough to deliver useful answers before the terrain has changed yet again (cancer doesn\'t evolve as fast as Internet vulnerabilities). But not anything to do with \'insiders\' or being a blowhard. On a more meta level of critique: while Thor is a moron, Wright is also guilty (as usual) of communicating poorly his ideas; and Wright comes off as a bit naive in his understanding of survival analysis and not appreciative of its limits (a lot like Bitcoiners trying to explain Bitcoin to laymen, actually, and getting about the same reactions too).\n\nOne might be amused to know that when I read through all Wright\'s email exchanges back in December, including this one, I took it as evidence for being Satoshi rather than !Satoshi: if I routinely got this sort of not even wrong reactions to my work, I\'d be pretty cynical and self-righteous too. _Baka bakka_.\n\n\\* I am assuming here that he performed the experiment as he wrote it up on his blog; even if he didn\'t, the methodology & analysis looked reasonable to me and the results as expected': 8, '"Pish posh!

Also, I\'m not a Core developer and they obviously know this better.\n\n>I hope this means they will stop calling forks like XT, Classic, etc. "attacks".\n\nBitcoin after all works because the community wants it to work. If miners at large start doing stupid things, the community can choose to change rules so shut down those stupid miners. All this means that it\'s the community who dictates what is Bitcoin. Changing Bitcoin requires consensus among the community. Spreading binaries/links to software which uses different rules than what the community is using, can be seen as an attack. Bitcoin will not be improved by competition between system rules. This is what altcoins are for. Want some other rules than what Bitcoin uses today? Make an altcoin. Want those rules in Bitcoin system? Follow the procedure. Procedure is shit? Improve it. Or don\'t. And don\'t follow the procedure if you don\'t want to. Makes it harder to get consensus behind the improvement proposal. Consensus behind the proposal is something that is hard to measure which is also why defining some improvement idea as an attack is highly subjective. In these cases high majority of the top experts of Bitcoin (not just devs but other smart people too) have been against those improvement ideas, which would make the more an attack than not an attack. If there was some reasonable amount of people supporting those ideas they wouldn\'t be seen as an attack by so big portion of the community.\n\nAlso, XT/Classic are not traditional forks. They use different rules than which Bitcoin system uses today. They\'re simply not compatible, even though they *currently* kind of are. But in right conditions they will operate in a non-compatible way, making them something else than Bitcoin we use today. Those clients do not have any sign of consensus support.

If this is true, it doesn\'t seem to count.\n\n>This is exactly the wrong attitude to take as stewards of a free software development project (imo), and what lead us to the present situation.\n\nNo, actually. Think about this. People want efficiency. Everybody wants efficiency. Efficiency goes straight against decentralization (currently, maybe improved in the future.) People at large don\'t understand or care about decentralization, this is obvious and nobody can deny this, right? People think it\'s cool and stuff but the real benefits are rarely visible. People who have had problems with centralized systems usually value decentralization and monetary sovereignity - which is what Bitcoin offers. What I mean by all this is that efficiency is a lot more important to people than decentralization. And the current situation is that you can\'t improve one without sacrificing another. It\'s obvious what majority of people would "vote" here. Actually, majority of people are already voting for the efficiency; they use centralized and therefore very efficient systems. After all majority of people don\'t have any problems with those centralized systems.\n\nBitcoin developers are those people who don\'t vote efficiency here. There are lots and lots of various systems which offer better efficiency than Bitcoin ever (possibly) can.

There are hundreds of thousands of OSS projects that have been launched by individuals, then an extra developer (or more) has jumped on board, but these projects have not exploded - maybe they got popular, but nothing crazy. Up until a certain point, Bitcoin was one of these, and Gavin was one of the kind programmers who contributed to a piece of open source software that he was interested in, and believed in.\n\nSo at some point, Bitcoin explodes, and Gavin is in a position that few people have been in.
