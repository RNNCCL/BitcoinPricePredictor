Most [new tech takes 10 years](http://www.websiteoptimization.com/bw/0712/consumer-tech-adoption.png) hu? hmmm, maybe not. The reality is *some* new tech rockets through adoption, but the only thing that is consistent is that every adoption rate is different, there is no guarantee of adoption, you just conveniently quote adoption rates for *succesful* techs, and completely ignore the ones that don\'t make it all the way, there are no smooth curves, nor does every tech reach a peak at the magical 10 year mark. So depending on a 10 year adoption rate so that you can predict a fair distribution is BS.\n\n> it would have been smarter to have a distribution curve that had only released around 10% of all coins by the 10th year instead of 60%\n\nI\'m sure people would have *loved* the many decades of inflation to come, rather than come to see Bitcoin become self sustaining in their lifetime. \n\n> this would have actually made the value of each coin greater and the profits for the early adoptors would have therefore been the same in dollar terms!\n\nOf course you\'d say that in hindsight but there is zero possibility that Satoshi could predict Bitcoin\'s growth pattern over time. He was conservative and gave Bitcoin lots of breathing room so that it could grow without being left without support, but he obviously wanted Bitcoin to be it\'s own self sustaining economy, not some network that prints money as a constant crutch to keep people using it. This is obvious because he used a geometric distribution, such that for a very long time to come, there will be a bare minimum block reward to keep miners interested just in case 10 years down the road transaction volume is still low. By that time though the majority of bitcoins will have been released so that the market can have a fair valuation without worrying about inflation eroding the value in the decades to come. This allows the system to be weaned off the inflation while still holding it\'s hand if it is necessary. It also provides an incentive for miners to include more and more transactions in the years to come as the reward lowers every 4 years.\n\nYou are so fixated on "fair" distribution, you are clearly blind to the other intricacies that help balance out other elements in the system, and how these elements help to make Bitcoin grow, rather than catering to every laggard several decades down the line. \n\nIf you feel so supremely confident go make your perfectly-fair-distribution-coin and bask in your "if you build it, they will come" mentality.

If they achieved a 10x or even 50x increase in their coin\'s value, they only did so by riding the wild ups and downs in the process, with absolutely no guarantee it would turn out in their favor, hardly a free ride, or a guaranteed return. Now you want to waltz in, pat them on the back and say, "you don\'t deserve this, all the other people who sat on their arses and laughed at you deserve a cut of your profits, give!" and then literally punish them so that the clueless can get a cut of the action.\n\nAs far as your dismissal of network effect is concerned, you\'re also making light of the fact that in 6+ years, there have been hundreds of alts that have been pretty much ignored. Most copy-coins, some supposedly innovative, and a few even have significant backing, but none of them have ever come close to Bitcoin, and never will because Bitcoin already has the lowest barrier to entry on all counts. No alt can top that unless it is so mindbendingly innovative (which is unlikely to say the least) that it makes Bitcoin look like a clunky dinosaur the same way Bitcoin makes the banking system look today, and even then theres no guarantee.\n\nYour list is fantasyland stuff, akin to saying I want to swim in the sea but don\'t want to get wet because I hate the feeling, saying,  "easier and cheaper platform to innovate on" and "fairer distribution" makes me wonder if you understand the history, and workings of Bitcoin because it just doesn\'t make sense.\n\nBitcoin\'s original client was MIT licensed from the start, so it was defacto free, and Bitcoin\'s distribution of coins was as fair as it could possibly get, by giving coins proportionately to every person that mined coins, thus in return for securing the network, that person would get coins to use as they please, thus every person that helped make the network better/more secure was rewarded for their work so only the people that deserved coins, got coins, and the barrier to entry was super low, any person could mine in the early days, if you had a PC and an internet connection you could mine blocks, additionally the coins went to the people that were most likely to use them in the first place, and it was proportional too, so people that provided more hashing power got a bigger slice of the reward. This had the additional benefit that people that received coins had an incentive to improve Bitcoin, thus they were incentivised to share successes, open source new software that utilised Bitcoin to spur adoption etc. and this happened a lot. People that have coins have a strong incentive to help others use Bitcoin, it never simply stopped at "I have coins, time to sit on them and watch them grow in value" like a bank account, because there is no guarantee it would grow. Failure was an ever present possibility in the early days. There was no playing favourites, or one person doling out coins to their friends or associates like Ripple\'s toxic form of distribution or Etherium\'s absurd fundrasing. It was first come first serve, and it was only those that got into Bitcoin in the early days that reaped the benefits. And they didn\'t get it easy, they were often laughed at, ignored, demonised and often bore the brunt of trolls and idiots before being vindicated. How could you possibly distribute the coins in any fairer manner than that is beyond me. \n\nWhat you are actually saying when you say you want a fairer distribution is acutally the inverse of what would actually happen, you want a risk free system where you take 99% of all the rewards from that 1% that did all of the work and distribute that to the 99% that did nothing because you think it is "fair".

So, if you want to mine, go for it, just don\'t try and mine bitcoin directly.  \n\nAs for the how it works part, there have been lots of suggestions by people, but here\'s my three sentence explanation. You understand bitcoins are generated by "solving math problems", and everytime a math problem is solved, which is on average about every ten minutes, a block is created and added to the blockchain. Also included in every block are a list of transactions from the last ten minutes; this is how money/bitcoin moves around. The blockchain grows over time, and is a ledger of all transactions that have ever taken place on the bitcoin network.': 1, '/u/dnrk, nappiral wants to send you a Bitcoin tip for 500 bits ($0.20).

It can also be fun to imagine you will win the prize.\n\nI think you might get better information if you pose close-ended questions.

If you had asked this question 2 years ago, I would have enthusiastically told you to go buy a nice graphics card and crank out some BTC.  But these days mining is extremely competitive and you\'d spend more on electricity than you would receive in BTC.\n\nBut don\'t worry - mining is the boring part of Bitcoin.  The exciting part is what you can do with the BTC once you have them...\n\n>Would i make any profit out of it, and if so, anything thats worth noting?\n\nI\'m not sure exactly what you\'d make, but it\'s probably something like $1 worth of Bitcoin a week. \n\nMy recommendations for beginners like yourself:\n\n1.  Buy some Bitcoins on www.coinbase.com.  Once www.circle.com is open for everyone, it\'ll be easier to use that (because it sends you the BTC right away unlike Coinbase which takes a few days).  But in the meantime Coinbase is reputable and a pretty good service.\n\n2.  Be sure to always use "2 factor authentication" when you\'re dealing with Coinbase.  You\'ll see it in the settings.  This is an option where you can enter your cell phone number and any time someone tries to send BTC from your wallet, your phone will receive a text message and you can confirm it or not.  Basically it makes stealing your Bitcoins next to impossible.\n\n3.  Bitcoin is generally a very deflationary money, which means it\'s a good idea to hold onto it if you can.  As it gains popularity, it will also gain value.  The "crashes" you always hear about are just natural market corrections - anywhere from 50-75% drops from the peak of the bubble.  We are currently near the bottom end of the trend, but there\'s always a chance it could drop lower.\n\n4.  Don\'t think of mining as a game.  It\'s primarily the verification of transactions, which is a boring and arduous task requiring a lot of electricity and specialized hardware.  But understanding **why** mining is necessary is a really fun and interesting thing to study.  Here\'s a good video giving an overview of it:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lx9zgZCMqXE  Here\'s a good video giving an overview of "public key cryptography", which is the basis for Bitcoin\'s address system:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QnD2c4Xovk\n\n5.  Besides the interesting technology behind Bitcoin, you should also understand precisely **why** it is such a major invention.  It has been called the biggest advance in money since the 15th century.

This is a quote from Peercoin\'s intro [sticky thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/peercoin/comments/2ffwcn/welcome_to_rpeercoin_intro_to_peercoin_important/)...\n\n"...one of the purposes of Peercoin\'s 0.01 PPC/kb network transaction fee is to eliminate blockchain bloat caused by microtransactions. As a result of microtransactions, Bitcoin\'s blockchain has grown massively in size, takes days to download and consumes high amounts of hard drive space. By comparison, Peercoin\'s blockchain remains tiny even after two years, the download time is quick and the entire blockchain is small enough to fit on mobile devices. This makes Peercoin more manageable than Bitcoin.\n\nEven though the transaction fee has been a positive for Peercoin so far, many people are concerned with the fee heading into the future because it would seemingly prevent Peercoin from being used as a transactional currency. A major part of the story is missing here though. In [an interview](http://www.peercointalk.org/index.php?topic=2218.msg18105#msg18105) dated 10/24/13, Sunny said:\n\n>"Right now, if we are talking about micropayments in the US$1 range, both PPC and XPM still handle them with much lower overhead than credit card networks. In the long term micropayments should be provided by **centralized providers, or a less decentralized network** optimized for high capacity transaction processing."\n\nA decentralized, censorship resistant blockchain is suitable for safe and secure storage of value, while a centralized or less decentralized off-chain solution is better for transactions due to high performance and low fees. Sunny thus designed Peercoin knowing that such off-chain networks would become important in the future.\n\nOne example of an off-chain network is [Open Transactions](http://www.opentransactions.org/), or OT for short. When implemented, OT will allow any size amount of Peercoin [or other crypto] to be transacted instantaneously, enabling Peercoin to retain its ability to be used as a transactional currency, even with the 0.01 PPC/kb fee still in place.\n\nAnother advantage is that Peercoin will handle its connection to an off-chain network like OT much better than Bitcoin. Bitcoin miners won\'t receive the fees from transactions happening within the OT network, which could become problematic for Bitcoin in the future once the block reward lowers. Peercoin on the other hand is perfectly set to handle this potential future due to the low cost of minting.\n\nPeercoin and off-chain networks like OT are perfect for each other. Peercoin provides a decentralized and secure currency while OT provides fast and inexpensive tools to manipulate and exchange Peercoins in everyday life. And Open Transactions is only one example. Peercoin will be able to connect to other high speed off-chain networks as they are developed and released."': 4, "Yes, Peercoin doesn't rely on transaction fees to sustain its network.

Bitcoin *is* infact changable.': -6, 'Here\'s a few scenarios that might play out in a conflict:\n\n1. **Developers release an "unofficial" version which is compatible with the "official" Bitcoin** (There\'s no real official version, but there are developers with a higher profile who are defacto authorities). Some people will update, some won\'t. If the changes don\'t break anything, it won\'t matter. If the changes are popular, they\'ll probably be included in the official version in the next release.\n\n2. **Developers release a new version of Bitcoin with new rules for validating transactions.** Some miners update to this version, and mine some blocks on it. These blocks aren\'t accepted by all miners, so you end up with a blockchain fork (also called a hard fork). If you have bitcoins on one fork, they are also on the other, but any transactions made after the fork are only valid on one side. You will only be able to sell them on an exchange which supports your fork. The value of Bitcoin will be diveded between the forks. The total value would probably fall a lot if the split were near 50%, but if only 0.01% of people used the new version, it wouldn\'t have much impact.\n\n3. **Devlopers release an update with a new mining algorithm and a completely new blockchain.** This is effectively a new coin, although someone may decide to keep the old blockchain. It\'s like Dogecoin, Peercoin or Litecoin. It shouldn\'t be called Bitcoin, and it probably wont. Its value starts at zero.': 2, 'Bitcoin is completely open source, so although there are some common procedures and processes that are typically followed by the usual core developers, anyone at all can make changes to the code. The issue is, only changes that most Bitcoin users choose to adopt become part of Bitcoin going forward. This is part of the democratic nature of Bitcoin, as changes require consensus.  \n\nFor example, I could arbitrarily decide to edit Bitcoin code to issue another 21 million bitcoins, and I start to run this new code. Before I can transact bitcoins with my new code, I\'d need to convince some number of other Bitcoin users to also adopt it. Realistically, for the change to "take", the number would need to be a majority. Obviously, other Bitcoin users would realize their bitcoins are worth more if they do not use my code, and just stick with the existing software. Therefore, I\'ve made a change, but no one else adopted it and it would never really be part of Bitcoin.  \n\nOn the other hand, if Bitcoin\'s value increases in the future to the point that each individual satoshi is worth too much or, say, microtransactions, someone could edit Bitcoin code to increase the number of base units, say, by 32x. This increases the number of slices per pizza while not increasing the number of pizzas, so to speak, and it makes Bitcoin more useful while not affecting the value of a single bitcoin. Such a change would likely be adopted by all Bitcoin users who see the need and find the change useful. If those adopting the new code are a majority, those who stayed with the old software will eventually find their legacy coins can\'t be used in most situations, and will basically need to switch to the new code to maintain the usefulness of their digital currency.  \n\nBut the currently allotted 2.1 quadrillion satoshis seems to be more than enough for the foreseeable future.': 2}, ('Reminder - GBA AMA today 7 PM GMT', 8): {'Oh nice, I have so many questions about the Game Boy Advance!': 2, 'Here is [the ongoing AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/2h5j1m/we_are_the_global_bitcoin_alliance_ask_us_anything/).': 1}}, '09-21-2014': {('How the US is actually insolvent - Assets & Liabilities - Crash Course Chapter 14', 2): {'Not mentioned: US productive capacity increases every single year due to things like technological progress and the debt we acquire today becomes pennies on the dollar tomorrow when we pay it back.

I disagree, because I don\'t think \'electrified\' can only mean hooked up to wires. In fact a dictionary definition of electrify includes \'thrill\', so by saying the house or audience was exactly, precisely, or truly thrilled there is no change necessary from what is meant to be conveyed to what actually happened. Literally fits perfectly well.\n\nAnother example is also from the 1800\'s, but from Sir Arthur Conan Doyle writing,  in The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes, that Sherlock\'s room "was literally ankle-deep with congratulatory telegrams."\n\nThe suggestion is that\'s probably figurative. The problem here is that Holmes and his room don\'t *actually exist*. That means there is no way *any* statement about it could be actually true, so using the word literally here is obviously used as art; the room may truly have had ankle-deep telegrams.
