Alot of the interactions are in the local language to bring bitcoin closer to all. But facebook posts have translate now button.\nThis Article is in English , describing the why Sudan is the No.1 Candidate for the use of bitcoin:\nhttp://bitcoin2fund.com/articles/1\n\nThanks': 6, 'Just a silly question, but knowing that sudan has gone through a certain level of strife, what exactly is the internet penetration in the country?\n\nNVM Found it: 21%\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_number_of_Internet_users\n\nBut looking at other resources regarding Sudan, bitcoin hardly seems like something that ranks high on the list of things that need to be changed or addressed over there:\n\nhttp://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/alertswarnings/sudan-travel-warning.html\n\nhttp://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/alertswarnings/republic-of-south-sudan-travel-warning.html\n\nI could be wrong though... but what number of freelancers are there in Sudan? Maybe they just need a current outsourcing website, like e-Lance, to begin accepting payments in Bitcoins and/or making payouts in Bitcoin. \n\nOf course, like many other cash strapped and unstable countries, Sudanese officials might be remiss about their people adopting bitcoin, as that could make capital flight that much easier.\n\nhttp://www.aefjn.org/index.php/370/articles/capital-flight-and-its-impact-on-africa.html': 3, 'I hope you get all the support you want, & something similar happen in Libya.': 1, "You can see only one location because :\n1. coinmap.org requests that the entity accepting Bitcoin be a physical location , so this exclude websites (like the freelance one)\n2. The group adds a location to the map when that location has an established track record in accepting bitcoins. this means that of you pick up the phone and dial the that shop's number in coinmap.org  and ask if they accept bitcoins they will not hesitate (just be mindful of the time zone when you call)  :-)": 2, 'I appreciate the insight and the patience to go and do the research,\n\nThe group focuses on the young , educated & urban in the large cities for a reason. those are the same young people who went back to their small towns and taught their friends and family how to browse the internet and how to use phones to transfer money. The internet is mostly Internet Cafes & mobile data, very few have DSL (that is mostly businesses & Internet Cafes). To be affordable pricing is further broken down into per day/ cheaper per service (access only to facebook and social networks etc.) \nAs I said people controlling their finances means that they can direct those finances to solve their pressing issues.\n\nI\'m not sure how many freelancers are there , but they could be found at:\nhttps://khamsat.com (not a Sudanese freelance website but with Sudanese freelancers, they get 10% sliced off their pay , by the payment brokers, after the website has taken it\'s sahre)\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/Sudanese.Designer/\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/SudaneseWeb/\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/sudanese.programmers/\n\nand of course other websites that I know nothing about. I hope that when freelancing is seen profitable & just more will head to that direction , reducing the 40% unemployment.\n \nI would love it if e-lance , freelancer.com or oDesk pay out in bitcoin (something many on these sites are demanding in the forums) they are alot better in marketing :-)\nBut again remember that many of those sites are US based and might not want to be involved in any "business" with Sudan.\nAlso I\'m sure you wouldn\'t hire many Sudanese freelancers :-) , not many speak English all that well. Their best customers will be the richer neighbors (Saudi Arabia is just across the red sea), who speak the same languages. the closer the cultures the easier design tastes and expectations are matched. \n\nAnd yes people controlling finances , could mean people controlling politics and their own destiny.\nEvery $100 dollars an expat sends to his family in Sudan using the traditional methods the government takes a big cut in the form of  the official artificial exchange rate that slashes at least 30% of  the real value of that $100 . when bitcoin is sent to a Sudanese designer, it goes to the designer.\n\nAs for Capital Flight , it\'s a very valid concern, it exists with the current banking systems,  it\'s a criminal offense that cannot be solved by the bitcoin algorithm, but cashing huge amounts of Bitcoins in another country by an official will need to go through an exchange, and exchanges can ask all sorts of questions pertaining to the source of the money. It has always been said that bitcoin is not 100% anonymous.\n\nAgain thank you, few people are willing to spend time researching and studying the situation in a country far away from them ,and discussing that. really appreciated': 3, 'So far self funded.

And that's the plan.\nYou also might be intrested in knowing that that small amount has helped in building a freelancers web site, gave away prizes in bitcoin, and for the first time ever enabled Sudanese to press a button and send payment in a global cutrency, Let's say that they discovrrrd how it feels to use paypal.\nNow that's a very efficient use of funds in my opnion.\nMind you that a $200 is respectable monthly salary for a new graduate over there.": 3, 'You call $200 and 30 likes "progress"?\n\nSudan has other bigger problems to deal with, like the civil war it\'s currently having.': 1, 'This is a great cause but there is no personal story behind the project.

Any more than that and you need a license.\n\nGetting a license is usually very time consuming and expensive. It's beyond the reach of a hobbyist. You basically need a working relationship with a bank who will let you operate under their money transmitter license. And in order to comply with the license, you need AML/KYC systems in place.

Printing money creates inflation.\n\nBitcoin's value is completely unknown, and its value is being driven by market speculation; supply & demand. The more people that believe in its ability to function as money in an economy, the higher the demand resulting in more people trying to buy in. A lot of people trying to buy bitcoin means they have to compete to buy before their competition - driving up prices. This is further increased by the understanding that there is a hard limit to the total supply of bitcoins, meaning that if a buyer believes that the utility and demand of bitcoin will continue to increase, and that the supply is fixed, the prices will keep rising - which makes bitcoin a deflationary currency.\n\nThe more utility the market thinks it has, the more value each bitcoin has.

Buying and selling are not distinct activities. They are different sides of the same trade. (Just nitpicking.)': 1, 'Here\'s how I usually explain what Bitcoin is and why it matters:\nThe reason it\'s so hard for most people to understand Bitcoin is that most people don\'t really understand money. Money isn\'t wealth. It\'s an accounting system used to facilitate the exchange of wealth. (The paradox of money is that while everyone wants it, no one actually wants it - they want the stuff they can buy with it!) Many people are put off by the fact that bitcoins are "just 0\'s and 1\'s" But that\'s what ALL money is, information! More precisely, money is a means for credibly conveying information about value given but not yet received (or at least not yet received in a form in which it can directly satisfy a person\'s wants or needs).\nTo put it yet another way, money is a ledger. With fiat currencies like the dollar, that ledger is centralized. And that gives the central authority responsible for maintaining that ledger tremendous power, power that history has proven will inevitably be abused. With Bitcoin, the ledger is decentralized. And that means that no one individual or entity has the power to arbitrarily create new units (thereby causing inflation), freeze (or seize) your account, or block a particular payment from being processed. We\'ve had decentralized money before. After all, no one can simply print new gold into existence. And the "ledger" of gold is distributed because the physical gold itself (the "accounting entries" in the metaphor) is distributed. But with gold, that decentralization comes at a heavy price (literally). The physical nature of gold makes it hugely inefficient from a transactional perspective.\nEnter Bitcoin.\nIt is the first currency in the world that is BOTH decentralized AND digital. It is more reliably scarce than gold, more transactionally efficient than "modern" digital banking, and enables greater financial privacy than cash. It could certainly still fail for one reason or another, but if it doesn\'t, it has the potential to be very, VERY disruptive.': 7, 'karma bites?': 1, ">Why do people value it? \n\nFrom an economic perspective, it doesn't matter.

However, as far as economic analysis is concerned, the *why,* regardless of what it is, does not make any difference in the outcome produced by analysis. All that is important is that people value or do not value it, economics is not concerned with the content or motivations of valuations, only their existence or non-existence.

You seldom if every hear of an actual scam that periodically dropping its value or returns as much as 60 - 95%, since such behavior would not provide enough of a consistent draw to fuel the continuing con. Bitcoin has exhibited such drops regularly after each spike/bubble.  \n\nAlmost everyone that spends the time to learn about Bitcoin's fundamentals realizes that it simply *does not meet* the definition of either a Ponzi scam or pyramid scheme.

Now, the stock is $2 per share. And not a single person bought a new share of the stock. It went up, without *requiring* the next person.\n\nBitcoin doesn't have the same mechanisms of an operating business.

Someone has to buy more.\n\nWith a stock, even if nobody bought 1 more unit, the value of a stock does increase as it represents a "share" of a company which may become larger simply because of increased company revenues/profits.

And although pedantically it isn't, I think that's a much more valid comparison than bitcoin. Most people think when their money goes into the Social Security Trust, it sits there segregated waiting for them like and IRA, and that's not the way social security works at all. But politicians are happy to describe it that way, so arguably they're being fraudulent in describing the source of your ss payments after retirement.\n\nBut even if we're being a little loose with the definition of a ponzi, bitcoin doesn't come close.\n\nNow as for a pyramid scheme, the defining characteristic is usually that you pay a kick-back to your higher ups.

In principle, if you were in on it early and it went viral, you could rake in tens of thousands of dollars.  However, every dollar earned by one person is a dollar lost by another, and people trying to jump on bandwagon too late (i.e., 99% of the people who participated) will never see their $10 back.\n\nI\'m not saying Bitcoin fits this model but there are a few similarities:  anybody who has profited from Bitcoin either in US dollars or merchandise has benefited at the expense of other people who have invested into Bitcoin.  It\'s a zero sum game.  Bitcoin doesn\'t make money.  If one day there are Bitcoin billionaires flying around the globe, it can only be because other people lost money to them in the process.

There is NO other reason for the price to go up. In that way, it feels like, and maybe is a scam. Things like stocks actually have earnings and business models that help them grow internally, but a Bitcoin unit is just a unit.

Bitcoin is as much an innovative achievement in social engineering as it is in computer science.\n\n* * *\n\nThinking about the fundamental flaws Bitcoin & Esperanto try to address gave me a lot to think about. Bitcoin introduced math as a new source of monetary authority, to compete with the central authorities that give us fiat money (flexible but unreliable), as well as the authority of physical attributes that gives us commodity money (reliable but inflexible). Math offers the promise of reliability AND flexibility.\n\nEsperanto *does* try to solve a fundamental flaw, but this is seldom acknowledged even by its proponents. It represents a comparable improvement over natural languages to that of the alphabet over ideograms or the Hindu-Arabic number system over the Roman system. These are brilliantly elegant ways to give symbols **universal** reach versus clumsy systems riddled with inconsistencies that make them hard to learn & limit their utility. The alphabet maps *all* sounds in a language to a few letters, positional number systems map *all* quantities to a few numerals and Esperanto tries to map *all* of grammar into a few morphological/syntactical rules. \n\nBoth alphabets & the Hindu-Arabic system took *centuries* to be recognized as an improvement and in both cases the decisive push came only after technology finally exploited their universality: the printing press for alphabets, computers for positional number systems.

Yes, the money/language analogy is one of the most important ones in Western thought. I love how this 1996 paper puts it:\n\n> \t**The metaphorical field circumscribing analogies between language and money is undoubtedly one of the most productive in all of Western culture.** Quintilian\'s admonition that one expend words as carefully as one spends money, Ovid\'s remark that words, like coins, are minted by public authority, Nietzsche\'s famous comparison of current words to coins that have lost their impression due to overcirculation, and Saussure\'s identification of linguistic significance with monetary value--what all these metaphors have in common is that they draw on issues of monetary practice to elucidate the operation and use of language. The historical extension of this metaphorical field is matched by its broad cultural dispersion throughout the European languages: comparisons between money and language are just as likely to be found among English or French as they are among German writers. The unusual vitality of this analogy between money and language is further reflected in the expansive semantic territory it encompasses.  Aside from the common identification of words with coins, many other elements drawn from the sphere of finance, such as the notions of circulation, exchange, credit, banking, counterfeiting, investment, etc., are frequently applied as metaphorical vehicles for the illumination of linguistic practices. *The vitality and diversity of this metaphorical field gives the best indication that the analogy between money and language in particular, and between the realms of economics and linguistics in general, is underwritten by a wealth of substantive capital.* Indeed, as Jean-Joseph Goux has argued, **the coherence and organic nature of this relation indicates that what is at work here is not a mere analogy, but rather a deep-seated isomorphism between the domains of money and language.**   \n> -Richard T.

Even in its current state you can set up a noob with a wallet pretty quickly.  \n\nThe learning curve of Bitcoin vs Esperanto differs by multiple orders of magnitude, and the gap is growing.  If you could become reasonably fluent in Esperanto after a 10 min convo with a friend at a bar, then it might actually catch on. ": 1, 'these guys are "whistling past the graveyard"': 1, '>Banking is fine how it is\n\n2008 crisis and the fact the US is still printing money 6 years later determined that was a lie.': 13, '>It\'s really not a good comparison. \n\nIt\'s not a good comparison, but I think it\'s actually a useful one to think about. Money is a lot like language. Language is a protocol for communicating all kinds of information, whereas money is a protocol for communicating *credible* information *about value*. And both language and money rely heavily on network effects, i.e. they both become more valuable / useful as more people use them. But there are several very important reasons why Esperanto\'s lack of success isn\'t particularly instructive when considering Bitcoin\'s prospects. \n\nFirst, existing languages don\'t suffer from some fundamental flaw that Esperanto solves. In contrast, I\'d argue that conventional forms of money do share a fundamental flaw that bitcoin solves: the flaw of requiring trust in a central authority.  \n\nSecondly, to the extent that existing languages do have flaws or limitations, those limitations can be fixed without starting over from scratch. Languages aren\'t static. New words / expressions are being created constantly. In contrast, fiat money isn\'t an open-source protocol. It can\'t be upgraded -- at least not in the fundamental ways that matter.\n\nAnother difference that limits the usefulness of the Esperanto / Bitcoin comparison is the relative importance of network effects. They\'re arguably much more important for language. Bitcoin has only a few million users spread around the world but that\'s already enough to create a vibrant and useful network. A few million Esperanto speakers spread around the world wouldn\'t translate into a network that would provide the individual members of that network with much value. (Maybe a good way to think about this issue is to say that language requires "currency" levels of adoption before it becomes very useful, whereas money can still be very useful with only "speculative asset" / "store-of-value" levels of adoption.)\n\nAnother difference is incentives. Bitcoin incentivizes its own adoption by rewarding early adopters; Esperanto doesn\'t. Even if you were convinced that Esperanto was going to be hugely popular in the future, there wouldn\'t be a significant opportunity cost associated with waiting to learn it until it actually did become widely used. With bitcoin, the opportunity cost would be enormous.\n\nFinally, the switching costs associated with learning a new language are huge. It takes most people months of regular study to gain a basic "conversational"-level of fluency in a new language and *years* for them to become truly fluent. In contrast, I can show someone how to send and receive bitcoin via something like breadwallet in 10 minutes, and bitcoin "fluency" can be achieved after a few days or (maybe more realistically) weeks of using and reading about it.': 8, 'They can criticize it all they want, and who knows what will happen, but the very fact that it is on their radar means something.': 6, 'Let the currency paradigm wars begin:\n\nuseless old IMF money junkies/criminals - VS - the PEOPLE': 9, "It means they're nervous.

And most importantly, what regulatory checks/other types of random checks you will be subjected to, you are supposed to be kept in the darkness by the laws and you never know when you will hit a wall.\n\nThe banking system looks like it's working simply because the elites leverage all their mights and resources to back it, alternative solutions could have been much more successful given a fraction of such support.\n\nAlso that comment completely misses the point: it's about money, not some language barriers which can be overcame with a bit of communications in other forms.": 3, "It's really not a good comparison.

It was the open-source alternative. And where Esperanto wasn't suitable, people could and did develop alts. But the change still happened top-down.

Are they equally culpable? Is the amount they stand to gain too little for you to cast circumstantial evidence their way?\n\nLastly the Fed does not quite "create the credit". Credit is a function of, and this is really simplifying it, the codification of property and rates and means of default. To suggest we are all "in debt" because of the national debt is pretty dramatic. Obviously the inverse is not true; we don\'t get richer when we run a surplus. And war, debt, and credit certainly predate "central banking" this apparent monolith that we can lay all evils upon and which BTC is going to slay. \n\nStop being lazy.

": 1, 'Here\'s how I usually explain what Bitcoin is and why it matters:\n\nThe reason it\'s so hard for most people to understand Bitcoin is that most people don\'t really understand money. Money isn\'t wealth. It\'s an accounting system used to facilitate the exchange of wealth. (The paradox of money is that while everyone wants it, no one actually wants it - they want the stuff they can buy with it!) Many people are put off by the fact that bitcoins are "just zeroes and ones." But that\'s what ALL money is, information! More precisely, money is a means for credibly conveying information about value given but not yet received (or at least not yet received in a form in which it can directly satisfy a person\'s wants or needs).\n\nTo put it yet another way, money is a ledger. With fiat currencies like the dollar, that ledger is centralized. And that gives the central authority responsible for maintaining that ledger tremendous power, power that history has proven will inevitably be abused. With Bitcoin, the ledger is decentralized. And that means that no one individual or entity has the power to arbitrarily create new units (thereby causing inflation), freeze (or seize) your account, or block a particular payment from being processed. We\'ve had decentralized money before. After all, no one can simply print new gold into existence. And the "ledger" of gold is distributed because the physical gold itself (the "accounting entries" in the metaphor) is distributed. But with gold, that decentralization comes at a heavy price (literally). The physical nature of gold makes it hugely inefficient from a transactional perspective.\n\nEnter Bitcoin.\n\nIt is the first currency in the world that is BOTH decentralized AND digital. It is more reliably scarce than gold, more transactionally efficient than "modern" digital banking, and enables greater financial privacy than cash.

E.g. a search engine which would work with structured data.\n\nA specific niche which might work pretty well is product search. E.g. "I want an Android phone with screen size between 4.5 and 5 inches, at least 2 GB of RAM, at least 3000 mAh battery."\n\nApp which could do that will be useful, doesn\'t have insane requirements (product database won\'t be so that huge) and is directly monetizable.': 4, 'Already exists!

It in eMule, a file-sharing program, which had Kad network (based on Kademlia DHT design) for file search. It was a bit slow, but still impressive  if you take into account given number of clients and files on that network.\n\nThe difference between a simple keyword-based search (which can be trivially implemented using a DHT) and a Google-like search engine is ranking. Ranking is hard.\n\nIt doesn't look like YaCy even tries to approach ranking, for example, when I search for 'bitcoin' it gave me this as a first result:\n\n    bitcoin | netzpolitik.org\n    bitcoin | org. https netzpolitik org tag bitcoin.\n    https://netzpolitik.org/tag/bitcoin/\n\nand another time I got this:\n\n    Bitcoin - BloombergHT.com\n    Bitcoin com. http www bloomberght com etiket bitcoin. bono borsa dolar...\n    http://www.bloomberght.com/etiket/bitcoin/1\n\nIt would be even more of a problem if there will be a lot of users and everybody will try to push up their content higher in the ranks. How do you ensure fairness?\n\nComplex queries are also a major problem for decentralized search engines. E.g. imagine that there is a million of index entries for `foo` and there is a million entries for `bar`, and if user wants documents which have both `foo` and `bar`, server has to find intersection of these sets.\n\nI don't know how YaCy handles this, but from what I see it doesn't handle that well.": 2, 'This is interesting. I hadn\'t thought of treating each content target as an item that could be verified and traded around as a "unit".

Something to think on.': 2, "I've only just started thinking about it and it would take some very careful figuring to reward those providing a useful function. So far I've been thinking of nodes that crawl and index independently and build their own index. Then users submissions are via portal nodes (which may be themselves) that encode terms and distribute them to the network. The indexing nodes return results which are consolidated by a portal node and ranked. Portal nodes might then be able to judge utility and downgrade index nodes that provide poor results, reward those that provide useful ones. How that works and what algorithms a portal uses may determine the utility of that portal as well.

Combined with a multi-sig transaction model that releases and returns the referred data when each agent has it's conditions met. How the scoring, storage and matching of data is done could vary and through a feedback/reputation system may weed out poor methodology and reward usable results.\n\nI'm thinking if you enter search terms and media type you may get back a sorted list of hits, scores and costs.

Sadly Interac Online isn't supported by most banks but the email transfers and debit card network is supported by all banks and CUs. \n\nThe not for profit Interac debit network was wide spread before the other innovations and Canadians are actively encouraged through advertising to use their Interac debit card and spend their own money rather than borrow with credit. So banks aren't as driven by profit for the stock holder in respect to credit cards but instead they did something that benefits the consumer as the consumer wasn't going to use the credit card anyways. American banks are to driven by the momentum and profit of credit card use (and even debit card use in the US which is also Visa and what not unlike Canada) to go ahead and innovate around the problem and create a system that subverts the slow and expensive credit card network. Instead America is relies on the Fed to update ACH and banks have no motivation to create a work around.\n\nAt least, that's my interpretation.\n": 3, "Hi,\n\nOur transaction limit for level 5.1 (when you verify yourself using our instant validation) gives you a transaction limit of 5.000 euro a day and a weekly limit of 25.000 euro. \n\nIf these limits doesn't suit your needs you can always contact us.\n\nIf you have any questions, please feel free to ask.": 3, "It's indeed simple and fast to use.
