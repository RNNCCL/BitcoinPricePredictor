Regulation as I usually take the word to mean, means regulating an industry.  The word regulation often means putting governmental limitations on free market activity, that is what I am against. \n\nHowever regulation can also mean free market regulations.  Like for example instead of relying on government insurance like the FDIC, we can have private insurance.  Instead of relying on the FDA, we can have free market organizations to put their seal of approval on things, and let consumers decide who to trust.  This free market competition is what is needed for healthy regulation.  When there are monopolies or oligopolies through governmental regulatory capture, that is when people suffer.  Being not subject to regulatory capture, free market organizations are more accountable, and have more incentive to do a good job.  They are less prone to corruption.  Free market competition destroys harmful monopolies.  The word regulation can have a lot of meanings, so don\'t get caught up on semantics.

In 2009 I started my first business, and later became interested in digital currency.\n\nHowever, going back a bit, I began my education studying biomedical chemical engineering, co-oped as an industrial stack tester (similar to an internship, except it paid really well), and later, after I had started my business and my son had been born, switched to study Microbiology as it had a lighter course load than engineering.  So, the scientific method is ingrained in me, and I understand the consequences of what we are doing right now, as it is being confirmed over and over and over.\n\nAlso, I have first person experience doing environmental testing for carbon emissions (and many toxic chemicals) from industrial plants.  My experience taught me that the EPA is corrupt, as is the entire industry surrounding environmental testing.  So many of those plants SHOULD have failed our tests.  I did the tests myself, and read the results.  However, if they failed, many times they would be "retested" and suddenly their numbers would be much lower.  Other times, the numbers would be high, but the EPA representative would just overlook it.\n\nI read the latest research from a variety of fields on a weekly basis, and something must be done.  The market is NEVER going to stop us from killing ourselves, as the environment is something that transcends the market.  \n\nIn almost every other situation, the industry in question, or the issue being raised, or the issue of competitiveness is solely within the market.  Regulation is horrible there, because regulation is just government manipulation that gives one company (or a group of companies) an advantage over others, or raises the barrier to entry to prevent new competition from ever arising.\n\nHowever, the market is contained within the environment.  EVERYTHING is contained within the environment.  What is good for the market is not necessarily good for the environment, but what is bad for the environment will inevitably be bad for the survival of the human race.  Unless we can invent some incredibly efficient process for removing the pollution from the air (unlikely, due to the incredible amounts being produced + lack of market incentive to do so), then we are screwed.\n\nSadly, in this singular case, the only answer truly is regulation, but not the kind of regulation we have today.  It needs to be a kind of regulation that is not influenced by industry, and that is determined by true experts in the field...and by expert, I do not mean experts in the oil industry, or coal industry, or nuclear industry, but experts in the scientific community that can mathematically, chemically, and statistically prove what is happening, how it is happening, and what must be done to stop it, regardless of any sort of economic consequences.\n\nOf course, the kind of regulation I am suggesting isn\'t going to happen anytime soon.  We would first need to change the entire economy and government from an overbearing, corporatist clusterfuck into an efficient, capitalist, minimalist government that only intervenes in cases such as this, where pure capitalism would actually end up causing widespread harm, but in a way that is hard for 99% of the population to understand, because it isn\'t actually going to REALLY have a devastating impact for quite some time, but once it does truly start, there will be no going back to stop it.  We will be at the point of no return.\n\n/rant off\n\n*sigh* This issue is one of the only reasons that I cannot fully commit to being a 100% anarchocapitalist.

By the time an anti-trust suit was being brought against them, they were already losing significant market share.  In fact, their competitors doubled (or more) their own market share between 1904 and 1906.\n\nMonopolies are only temporary, and competition will arise.  The original monopoly that standard oil enjoyed as not due to incredible business savvy (though, that was a big part of it\'s success), but due to deals made with the federal, and various state governments.  They had almost complete control of all the oil pipelines, huge control of the rail lines, etc., some of which was due to deals with private companies, but much of it was in a way that would not be possible if they were not being given that control by the government.  THAT lead to their monopoly, and the erosion of their control BEFORE the anti-trust suit was actually due to many states realizing this and allowing competition.  For a long time, the states actively BLOCKED competition for them.\n\nA monopoly has two legs.  One is a giant corporation (or group of corporations) and the other is a government to keep it stable.  Without the government support, a monopoly can never truly remain on top.  Companies can grow large, and start to get close, but that makes them inefficient and cumbersome. Small, agile competitors will always spring up and eat away at their market share until they collapse (or at least get significantly smaller).': 2, "> We have common sense laws like don't steal, don't rape, don't kill, etc.. that is all you need in a free society.\n\nSo you're saying some regulation of the marketplace *is* common sense.

You argue that some regulation is flawed and some beneficial, as I do.\n\n\nNote that I don't fetishize the free market concept or think it's the apex of human organization - I think an unfettered free market is a fundamentally flawed concept.  A free market requires its participants to constantly be making rational and informed decisions, which is impossible if the channels for gathering information may be owned by entities with their own interests.  Also I believe economies of scale lead to monopolies by their very nature, which are at least as abusive as regulatory entities and accountable to the public in a much less direct way (if they provide a good/service for which the demand is relatively inelastic).  So, yes, some regulation is required.\n\n\nI'm merely pointing out that most of society agrees with me on this and to dismiss everyone with this position as incapable of free thought or uneducated on the free market / libertarian concepts is the opposite of the logical argument that it purports to be.": 1, 'Awesome reply! Agree with all!': -1, 'No saying something is a fetish of free market, makes you sound like a real jerk.  Seems like your have a foot fetish, in the form of licking government boots.  But I should have expected this from someone named "theonetruesexmachine".  Anyone who understands capitalism knows that regulatory capture is what causes monopolies, and if you want to deny it and make insults calling it a fetish, then you are a very sick individual.\n\nWhat you said makes absolutely no sense.  You said that you "believe free market leads to monopolies and other anticapitalist entities"  This is a complete paradox what you said, and your statement contradicts itself, and makes you seem not very intelligent.  Free market leads to anticapitalism eh??  You are very confused because we have not had free markets in a long long time, which is why the monopolies exist.  You are looking at all of our problems and blaming capitalism, when we do not have capitalism right now, we have communism.\n\nIn the communist manifesto, some of the main tenets are a central bank, a graduated income tax, public education, and public healthcare.  By any logical metric, America is now a communist country.  So pointing to America\'s problems of monopolies and blaming the free market, seems like a government licking boot fetish to me.': 1, 'Evan added it that way himself.

However, even as a Libertarian, I can see the good in regulations for certain areas...mainly environmental issues, as our environment is one of the few things that transcends the market.\n\nUnfortunately, the EPA and other regulatory bodies that are in charge of enforcing environmental regulation are corrupt and do a horrible job at it.\n\nOutside of environmental issues, I see very little need for regulation at all.  In fact, most regulation that SEEMS to have a "positive" effect is actually just nullifying, or controlling, previous regulation.': 2, 'The problem with a private EPA is that it would have no bite.  In some markets it would work, but when being environmentally friendly is more expensive than not, why do they care if they have the private EPA\'s stamp of approval?  If they are operating on their own private property, how are they to be stopped?  Boycott them?  Human nature will stop that from succeeding, because their goods will be cheaper, and the fact that they pollute the environment will not matter to enough people that they will still have buyers.\n\nThat is the problem with environmental issues, and the reason that it is the big problem with pure capitalism for me.  I am ALMOST a complete anarchocapitalist, but this issue is too large to allow the market to decide, because it is an issue that is outside of the market rather than contained within it.\n\nIf a company is producing pollution that is going to destroy the Earth in 50 or 100 years (or longer), there is a good chance that they won\'t give a fuck.  There is also a good chance that many others won\'t give a fuck either.  Selfish people who do not care about future generations just won\'t fucking care.  The ONLY way it would be feasible for a purely capitalist approach to work in this case would be for the most environmentally friendly methods to also be the cheapest, which is far, far from reality.\n\nThat is why I support a very small, very limited government.  A government who\'s sole task is to enforce rules and regulations on very specific issues (aka, issues which TRULY destroy, endanger, or harm others, or the future of our planet).  Now, I don\'t mean that should be extended to every little thing that someone can claim is "harming" them.  There needs to be proof.  Fortunately, there is ample proof that what we are doing to the environment IS and WILL CONTINUE (at an exponential rate) to cause a catastrophic change in our atmosphere, climate, and the planet\'s habitability (for humans).\n\nI don\'t think we will wipe out all life on Earth.  Life will go on.  Just, at the current rate, we will wipe out all human life.  In fact, much of the recent data has been pointing to the idea that we actually need to become carbon NEGATIVE (and I say carbon...but it really includes other elements and chemicals...carbon just keeps it simple).  We have already reached a point that even the entire world becoming carbon neutral would lead to catastrophe.  It would just take longer.\n\nMaybe someone will find an incredible use for graphene, carbon nanotubes, etc., an efficient way to extract CO2 and split it, and that would solve all of our problems.  Unfortunately, that is quite unlikely, because O2 is easy to get, and so is carbon, so it would need to be REALLY REALLY efficient, or would need to be a use for carbon-based materials that requires such a huge amount that other methods cannot keep up with demand.\n\n**All that being said, I agree with you in almost every other way.  I am actually the victim of corrupt regulation myself.  My first business was in telecommunications, and grew extremely quickly.  Our first year we brought in ~$500,000 in revenue (gross) and ~$200,000 in profit. By our 3rd year, our growth was on track to hit somewhere between $5,000,000 and $7,000,000 in revenue for the year.**\n\n**Unfortunately, the Baby Bell Cell Companies (I\'m sure you know which ones I mean) had managed to get one of their lobbyists in as the chairman of the FCC.  Soon after, new regulations completely decimated our business plan, and we had to shut down operations (we were just collateral damage.  The regulation was actually aimed at small telephone companies, and has successfully been bankrupting them and allowing the Baby Bells to buy them up for almost nothing).**': 1, 'Seems like you think regulation is a bad thing.  The truth is it\'s neither... there\'s both good and bad regulation, and making overgeneralizing blanket statements like "all regulation is good" or "all regulation is bad" is closed minded and represents the antithesis of free and logical thought.  Taking either extreme position leads to equally biased worldviews.': 1, "The constitution was never changed. It was changed for example when the 18th amendment was added for the prohibition of alcohol.  Later when prohibition was repealed, the 18th amendment was repealed.  How come for the war on drugs there was never a constitutional amendment to make drugs illegal?  Oh because the tyrants in the government stopped following the law of the land, that is why.\n\nIf they want to disobey the current constitution then they need a constitutional amendment.  If no amendment then it means they are criminals and guilty of treason against America.  You hate to break it to me, but we live in a communist country now that doesn't obey the constitution? Nice, it seems you are happy with the American Republic being destroyed.  You may be guilty of treason as well for supporting such a thing.  The penalty for that used to be death. ": 1, 'Nice post.': 1, 'Very interesting points, thanks for your post.  I agree with much of what you said.  That is why it is often bad to label ourselves as anarchocapitalist or any label, because reality is much more complex than simple labels.  One point I would like to make is that we have not truly seen free markets in our country in a really long time.  So we never know what kind of free market solutions could arise from capitalism.  \n\nWe have seen giant leaps in technology over the years, most of this technology was lead by the USA because in the past we had a lot of freedom, which allowed innovation.  Now we are kind of running on fumes, and the anti-capitalist controls are squashing innovation.  Imagine if we had true freedom, the types of technology that we might develop.  Maybe if we had true capitalism we would be able to create technologies that help the environment.  Also there could be private EPA type entities that regulate businesses or put their stamp of approval on businesses.  If those private EPA type organizations become corrupted the consumers will react by choosing a different private EPA type organization to trust.  It stops regulatory capture.  In this way the free market competition weeds out the corruption.  Then consumers who care about the environment will buy from companies with their seal of approval.  Many people do care deep down about environmental issues, meaning there is a market force driving innovations that benefit the environment.': 1, "You have some pretty logical points.  It is true no system is perfect in an imperfect world.  I care about the environment also.  Possibly there could be some free market solutions to environmental issues. But it seems environmental regulation just gets completely subject to capture.  \n\nRegulatory capture of the EPA could result in large corporations getting away with pollution on an even greater scale than in a free market system.  For example the delapidated nuclear power plants are a huge problem in the USA and around the world as we found with Fukushima.  Yet in many instances these companies like General Electric are protected by governments.  The risk once again is put upon the public, while the profits are privatized, similar to the banker bailout issue.  Also when people get hurt by a melt down like Fukushima the corporations don't seem to be paying anybody for damages.  \n\nThere is a huge energy problem in the United States due to regulations on carbon emissions as well.  Since the regulators are captured, GE is allowed to have a monopoly on energy production and other companies are restricted by the laws.  This is seen for example, with Obama's words on wanting to bankrupt the coal industry, while the head of GE is on his economic board: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aTf5gjvNvo": 1, 'Coinbase begs to differ': -2, 'The companies working as MSBs are in a position where they have no choice but to comply with regulations at the moment, or else risk jail time / huge fines.\n\nI expect these issues to be temporary in the long run.': 6, '/u/dontgetgoxed, theonetruesexmachine wants to send you a Bitcoin tip for 1 dunce cap (0.727 mBTC/$0.35).

This is the most terrible form of slavery, because the mind slave is not aware that he is a slave to his rulers\' desires, commandments and beliefs.  As a consequence of that lack of awareness, the mind slave cannot begin the process of freeing himself from these beliefs.  By way of analogy: if you are not aware that you are in a cage, why would you try to escape it?\n\nOK, with that bit of background info, we can talk about the specifics.\n\nMost of the world is currently enslaved to the idea of obedience to authority as virtue and disobedience as vice (in contemporary language: "crime").  This idea is networked with a number of corollaries that are usually taken for granted.  One of these corollaries is the authoritarian belief that kidnapping people for selling and buying certain substances is just and righteous.  Why is that act normally considered "just and righteous"?  Because the authorities *have ordered it so*.  Since, as we saw earlier, disobedience to authority is normally considered vice, then it is righteous to ruin the lives of people who sell and buy said substances.\n\nUlrich showed the world by example that it *is* possible to conceive of selling and buying substances being a virtuous, peaceful and customer-oriented enterprise.  This leads people who hear about Ulrich to question the corollary we discussed above -- it leads them to ask themselves "is it really just and righteous to ruin the lives of all those thousands of people peacefully exchanging stuff?"  This will lead them to the thought that, perhaps, a person who sells a bag of weed doesn\'t do so because he is "evil", and a person who buys a gram of cocaine isn\'t necessarily bad either.  Once they stop seeing drug merchants and customers as evil, the prior belief ends and the door for empathy opens.\n\nSome people will undoubtedly repress this palpable moral progress with "you moron, drug dealers can\'t be good people, don\'t you see that they are disobedient and disobedience is bad?" or some variant thereof.  You\'ll recognize them easily because they usually get very angry with you, sometimes even violent (see: policemen), when you question their addiction to obedience.  These people are obviously broken to the point of incorrigible, and we must wait until they die of old age for their beliefs to become obsolete.\n\nBut others will inevitably conclude that ruining lives for trading substances is very much wrong, and since that new realization conflicts with the belief in obedience, they will actually begin to question obedience as virtue.\n\nAnd that is quite literally the beginning of real freedom -- a kind of freedom that captivity cannot take away from you, because it\'s the freedom of your mind.  While it is true that your body can be forced into a cage and brutalized in the most horrific ways (see: police brutality), you cannot be forced to obey willingly.  A mind can be obliterated, but it can never be re-enslaved.\n\nIn other words, Ulrich showed, by direct example, that the idea which enslaves so many, can in fact be questioned.  And once an idea begins to be questioned, it can no longer enslave the mind.\n\nThat is why we can say, at least in a metaphorical sense, that Ulrich has "freed us all".': 1}, ("I've been accepting Bitcoin for closed-source 3D printers for a while now.

Any tax payable would have to be paid in Canadian dollars." For Wagepoint, however, it works differently. Rao said for tax purposes, employees are still being paid with Canadian dollars on paper. He said workers can have all or part of their wages in bitcoins, and taxes are taken from the Canadian dollar salary before the remainder is converted.\n\nI did read the article, and the part above is ambiguous. However, if the case is the alternative, that basically employees can chose, after they are paid, to automatically have a portion of their wages converted into Bitcoins as a previous agreement, this is no-different to buying Bitcoins. Maybe there will be future issues based on GST for this, but I agree what I said doesn\'t apply to this scenario. Notwithstanding the above, what is said was a consequential, or logical, extension of the facts, where the contract was negotiated in such a way that this requirement is stipulated whether by preference of the employer or the employee, issues will arise. (Even if it is post-payment automatic conversion, if you are given no say over it, a court will consider it a composite transaction.)': 0, "That's almost 82%": 5, 'nice trend :)': 9, "I would?

': 2, 'Well said.': 1, "I understand why you wouldn't want to be paid with Bitcoin; my question was about why being offered that possibility would make you want to quit your job.": 1, "According to Canadian law (federal and in all provinces), wages must be paid in Canadian currency. If you are paying wages in Bitcoin, filing for tax for wage payments in Bitcoin is illegal and bad business practice since an employee can claim that they were never paid at all even if you've filed your taxes. (Say you pay them in Bitcoin but you state on the tax return the Canadian currency equivalent value) Since this is the case, the rational business practice of any individual would be to not file at all, the most common businesses that don't file taxes are those who hire people off the books, small businesses such as restaurants and others where the staff is easily replaced if complaining about wages, hours, etc. If this happens, you have no recourse to the law, since you were working illegally and your employer has hired you illegally, so you are both engaged in illegal activity and any contract between you (oral or otherwise) is void for illegality.\n\nNow, as per that article, some people are voluntarily accepting Bitcoin as payment, however, since this is not a recognized form of wage, you are basically entering into an arrangement where you can be underpaid without reference to the minimum wage. This can be due to non-recognition of the currency, where you again end up in a quasi-legal situation of receiving something other than money for work (like being paid in sandwiches for working at subway, clearly a strange arrangement), and both you and your employer can be exposed to liability as a result of such an arrangement. However, there are also external factors, imagine a scenario where the value of Bitcoin falls very sharply against CAD, and you have signed a contract to work for, say, 2 Bitcoins per week. You've struck a bad bargain, that's for sure, but since Canadian currency is the benchmark for minimum wage, you're being underpaid considerably. Whether or not you have recourse to the employment law in such a scenario is questionable and therefore the contract is risky, but either way you may not want to be held to a contract that, depending on the value of Bitcoin, forces you to work for x years for next to nothing. You lose your employment rights purely by being outside of the purview of the law.\n\nEDIT: There may be equitable remedies available for cases such as the above, but my point was employment law, purely, not unjust enrichment or other legal doctrines.
