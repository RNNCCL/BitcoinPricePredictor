Also the details of what axioms to use and how to select the basic set theory underlying the hierarchical extension to be constructed are not fully crystallized. I have also a great fear of possible error in studying topics in this area. It is not rare, historically, for systems to be proposed that are either inconsistent or that have unexpected weaknesses. So I feel that I must be cautious and proceed without rushing to a goal. And this psychology of fear has also inhibited me from consulting other persons expert in logic before I could feel that I had gotten my own ideas into good shape."': -1, '>    I think there is a good analogy to mathematical theories like, for example, \xe2\x80\x9cclass field theory\xe2\x80\x9d. In mathematics a set of axioms can be taken as a foundation and then an area for theoretical study is brought into being. For example, if one set of axioms is specified and accepted we have the theory of rings while if another set of axioms is the foundation we have the theory of Moufang loops.\n\n>    So, from a critical point of view, the theory of macro-economics of the Keynesians is like the theory of plane geometry without the axiom of Euclid that was classically called the \xe2\x80\x9cparallel postulate\xe2\x80\x9d. (It is an interesting fact in the history of science that there was a time, before the nineteenth century, when mathematicians were speculating that this axiom or postulate was not necessary, that it should be derivable from the others.)\n\n>    So I feel that the macroeconomics of the Keynesians is comparable to a scientific study of a mathematical area which is carried out with an insufficient set of axioms. And the result is analogous to the situation in plane geometry, the plane does not need to be really flat and the area within a circle can expand hyperbolically as a function of the radius rather than merely with the square of the radius. (This picture suggests the pattern of inflation that can result in a country, over extended time periods, when there is continually a certain amount of gradual inflation.)\n\n>    **The missing axiom is simply an accepted axiom that the money being put into circulation by the central authorities should be so handled as to maintain, over long terms of time, a stable value.**\n': -1, '> Ideal Money does NOT suggest bitcoin is Ideal because everyone thinks they can use it or because it is decentralized or has a locked supply.\n\nIf it doesn\'t have a limited supply, then it\'s not money.  Decentralization helps it to have a limited supply.  If people can\'t use it, then it\'s not any better than gold, which has already failed to become any kind of "global standard" and failed to drag national currencies kicking and screaming towards "ideality" -- a state which they have no incentive to adopt voluntarily.': 3, '"Ideal Money" is a proposal John Nash left for the world. The key points are:\n\n1) Nash foretold of a coming electronic global currency in the form of a stably issued monetary supply that would take the power of the governments and central banks to print money.\n\n2) Nash points out different periods of history where wise and scientific decisions were made by either one persons or a small group of persons that necessarily effected the quality of society based on the quality of decision and money standard at the time. \n\n3) Nash talks about Gresham\'s Law and how bad money supplants the good (not the other way around!), and rather if the peoples want good money then it must be by their own will and the politicians that represent them that will decide to adopt such a standard.\n\n4) Ideal Money does NOT suggest bitcoin is Ideal because everyone thinks they can use it or because it is decentralized or has a locked supply.  Ideal Money talks about a global standard like that of gold, in which all nations can begin to define their own currencies in relation to such a standard we all agree on. The future RESULT, is a trend towards Ideality.\n\nI see two choices for the future of bitcoin in this regard.  We can try to make bitcoin the new currency, without considering the ramifications in relation to the current global financial system.... or we can choose to have a new gold standard that can bring peace and harmony among nations. \n\nI think then players like Nash, Satoshi, Szabo, and those that have carefully contemplated this debate for many years have realized the great difficultly is convincing the masses to let go of what they think is "Ideal Money".  Money is the thing we all must agree on, money is the thing that represents a solution to that which we CANNOT agree on.  This debate isn\'t about the "I", this debate is about the "we".

Thinking about these points in relation to bitcoin:\n\n>Nowadays, however, few would propose a return to the actual use of simply the metal gold as a standard, for the following reasons. \n\n>(i) The cost of mining gold effectively does depend on the technology. Recent cyanide leaching techniques have made it possible again to profitability mind gold at formerly abandoned sites in the U.S. so that it is now a big producer.  However, the unpredictability of the cost is a negative factor.  \n>(ii) The location of potential gold-mining locations may not be \xe2\x80\x9cpolitically appealing.\xe2\x80\x9d so it would seem undesirable to make a political choice to enhance the economic importance of those particular areas. \n\n>(iii) There is some negative psychology about gold such tat even if it were the most logical choice after all, the unpopularity of the idea could be very obstructive.\n\n\n>However, right now platinum would be even better than gold, because it has more value per unit of weight.\n\n>Crude petroleum could also be used for barter transactions, and in view of the present state of the global economy it would seem a proper component of an index of prices of internationally traded commodities that enter into the costs of industrial consumption.": 1}, ("Carlos Garza's SEC testimony about the alleged fraud at GAW Miners is a sight to behold", 41): {'Why?': 1, '[deleted]': 3, 'At first I was amused by his regurgitated reply but by page 20 it got old.

BlueMeanie is a well-known troll in crypto. If you look at his twitter profile it is just him either making fun of bitcoin or attacking people in crypto for no good reason.\n\nI am hesitant to even respond to him, because that is how he gets his kicks. He follows people around the internet with his pants around his ankles and his dick in his hand, and when they turn around to respond to his stupid ass, he starts jerking it.\n\nBut, there is some pretty harsh accusations here, so I\'ll address them real quick, but then I have to go do some actual work.\n\n(1) On Carlos, I didn\'t mention it in my medium piece because its already public knowledge and Carlos was on the run for years. He fooled a lot of people. For everything bad CoinTelegraph did, they didn\'t hire him knowing his past, he was using a fake name. None of us knew he was wanted until the day he got arrested.\n\nSo what does any of that have to do with CoinTelegraph\'s ownership or funding? It doesn\'t. The dude is in jail, likely for the rest of his life. He doesn\'t write for CoinTelegraph any longer. I don\'t see how that is important to the question of "who owns CoinTelegraph?"\n\n(2) I never participated in any harassment of Bluemeanie, I talked ot him once on Skype to ask him for evidence about his accusations against NXT, but after realizing he was just a troll, I left him alone and moved on. I have never written about him, I didn\'t edit the one article that CoinTelegraph did write on him, and I have no idea why he thinks I am part of some grand conspiracy against him.\n\n(3) I never participated in any kind of scam with NXT. I don\'t own any significant amount of any cryptocurrency besides Bitcoin. My NXT holdings topped out at around 20 bucks. I generally don\'t buy the altcoins I write about for two reasons: One, they are too risky, you need to depend on Bitcoin to succeed and then on top of that you also need the alt to succeed. And Two, I don\'t want any conflicts of interest. I normally only purchase a small amount ot test the system. Usually that is five or ten bucks. In the case of NXT it was a little higher because I wanted to test their asset exchange and so I wanted more to spread around, but it never was above 20 bucks.\n\nBesides, people shouldn\'t take investment advice from my articles and I never presented them as such. My background is in Tech writing and I talk about them in a way that (hopefully) bridges the understanding from expert to layman.\n\nEvery time I wrote about NXT, I did it because I had a legitimate interest in their technology. CoinTelegraph never encouraged me to write about NXT. That isn\'t to say that they haven\'t collaborated together, I know there was a public contest they were a part of, but by that time they had stopped trusting me.\n\nBut, plenty of other crypto sites and journalists have ALSO written about NXT because their technology is interesting. Bluemeanie must have once felt this way because he was once an active member of their forum. That\'s where he became infamous, he has been a member of their forum since May 2014 and has over 600 posts there. His public NXT account 11274042109288826540 has had more that a million NXT pass through it. Yet I\'m the one who participated in a ponzi scheme when I\'ve never owned more than USD $20 in NXT.\n\nOn the BTER.com hack, I talked to NXT and I talked to BTER. The only person left to talk to was the hacker, and he wasn\'t going to speak to me. So I published that article with the best information I could find at the time.\n\nI am no friend of BTER and heavily attacked them for the BitBay scandal, which I covered.\n\nIn any case, you\'ll notice he never posted a single shred of evidence to back up his ridiculous claims.\n\nI was never rolling in money from cointelegraph. I doubt I ever made more than 8/hr working there. Writing is not a lucrative venture, especially when you start refusing to write copy as I did.\n\nI don\'t know if he ever raised the question to me a year ago or not, but the fact of the matter is, I am poor as shit, and I wasn\'t in a position where I could throw away my only job. I\'m sure Bluemeanie can just quit his job whenever he wants, what with 1million NXT stashed somewhere, but I can\'t. And besides, I don\'t normally respond to trolls who go around throwing false accusations.\n\nAs for me quitting now that it is going down. Well, I have chatlogs that can prove I was planning this for a while. In fact, the art you see on the medium post was originally going to be used on Cointelegraph\'s website itself, and I had it made up long before that post came out, but I decided that\'d would have been too mean.\n\nFrom what I have been told, pay has been coming on time ever since my madbitcoins interview. I don\'t buy the narrative that they are broke, they have just sucked money out of it and kept it for themselves. But now that they know what can happen when you treat your writers badly, I think (hope) they are wising up.\n\nIn any case, if you bothered to even look at my posting history, you\'ll notice that I hardly wrote for them anymore anyway. So their financial situation didn\'t really affect mine.\n\nBut, I do have a book deal, and the better thing for my career would have been to simply suck it up and promote it once it came out.\n\nI didn\'t work at CoinTelegraph for years. I\'ve worked there for 1.5 years.\n\nBluemeanie just wants attention. He had not talked to me in probably a year, maybe a little less, but he had hardly been hounding me with questions about CT. He just noticed that I was getting some attention, and decided he could maybe bring the spotlight on himself once again.\n\nSo, while Bluemeanie is talkign about me so much, lets talk a bit about him.\n\nHere is his most recent tweet, where he says he wants bitcoin to die.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/BlueMeanie4/status/633472014825590785\n\nand here he is,  at the UROSE Conference (Urocoin) promoting Polychains SPOW, a non existent technology he was pushing at said conference.\n\nUrocoin, if you are unaware, was a known scam that claimed to be a new revolutionary way to buy and sell Urea, a fertilizer. It was promoted as something to help third world farmers. Uro coin was supposed to be pegged to Urea.\n\nIt never came out and never had a chance of ever working, but they took a ton of investments from people and made a ton of money. Its creator Bohan Huang is now missing, its site is down and its foundation hasn\'t made a peep in months. People lost thousands of dollars in Uro.\n\nHere is Bluemeanie talking at the Urocoin conference. He is credited as the creator of the non-existent technology that helped scam untold thousands of dollars out of investors who thought they were investing in something that would help poor third world farmers.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/DanDarkPill/status/527568566015774720/photo/1\n\nWhat is your connection with Urocoin, Josh?\n\nAs for if I "knew i was working for cointelegraph or not" That was the most confusing and bizarre conversation I have ever had (if you can call interacting with bluemeanie a conversation). He accused me of taking money from NXT, I said I don\'t take payment for articles, meaning i don\'t take the kind of payments he was talking about, and then he took that tweet out of context and said that I claimed not to be paid at all for my articles.\n\nIt was a pretty pathetic attempt to defame me and to this day I\'m still not sure what he was accusing me of when he said I wasn\'t sure if I worked for CoinTelegraph or not.\n\nI don\'t think I have ever written about Jl777 in an article, and quite honestly, I wouldn\'t buy his securities either. But you know who did back in the day?

It\'s currently possible to jam a Bitcoin node by connecting to it repeatedly via different IP addresses, as there is a fixed limit on how many connections a node will accept. Once full, no other peers or wallets can connect to it any more and serving capacity for new nodes and P2P wallets is reduced. If the attack is repeated against every node, the entire network could become jammed.\nThis patch set introduces code that runs when a node is full and otherwise could not accept new connections. It labels and prioritises connections according to lists of IP ranges: if a high priority IP address connects and the node is full, it will disconnect a lower priority connection to make room. Currently Tor exits are labelled as being lower priority than regular IP addresses, as jamming attacks via Tor have been observed, and most users/merchants don\'t use it. In normal operation this new code will never run. If someone performs a DoS attack via Tor, then legitimate Tor users will get the existing behaviour of being unable to connect, but mobile and home users will still be able to use the network without disruption.\n\nhttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1156489.msg12181889#msg12181889\n\n> You have privacy issues but dont care about being vulnerable to DDos?\n\n>  set -disableipprio=0\n\n> Problem solved.

You could become an agent of a principal licensee.\n\n   -- This one is my personal favorite because it puts YOU in charge of how much $$ you want to make! There are a few exchanges and brokerage services that are licensed in the US to run MSBs. Some of these institutions have programs that allow you to become an agent of them under their AML policy. This means that all compliance burden is on the exchange itself which leaves you to focus on marketing and growing your business. Obviously this is the most costly option as it requires you to put up the capital to purchase a machine and provide float capital to keep it running.\n\n\n\nAll that being said it's definitely worth it. And depending upon what market you are in, it can be VERY worth it. Typical pricing on machines right now is varying between 7-18% markup on exchange rates. I also know that on the LOW end a machine can do $10k in volume a month. And i've seen some on the high end do over $200k a month in volume.

If the majority of the user base considered the original bitcoin the correct one, they could fire up GPUs and old Jalape\xc3\xb1o paperweights and keep it going (albeit slowly).

": 3, "Doesn't seem like they are strong arming... seems more like they are getting the ball rolling because at least they put a January 2016 date to get another fix in before XT's changes have an opportunity to be applied. To me, if Core can get to some solution before January 2016, then people would jump onto and support Core. Why doesn't Core propose some code or solution that people can get on board with? The miners will vote and run whichever code is the right approach.": 1, "Not once. This is not to say that I'm a Gavinite or a Corebie.. I have chosen to adopt the XT fork for two reasons. \n\nFirst, I have a capacity planning background, and I believe that when you reach a certain utilization threshold, you need to increase capacity. Period. Bitcoin has reached that threshold. Any capacity planner will tell you that you don't wait until you're regularly bumping up against the limit. You expand capacity BEFORE you start bumping up against the limit. You expand capacity when you are regularly above a certain mid-point. We're at that point today and the only option available to us TODAY is to relax the block size limit. The exact approach taken, whether that's 2MB, 20MB or somewhere in between, or just eliminating the artificial restriction altogether and letting the market decide what the right levels are, or some dynamic approach, is less important to me than the simple fact that we MUST increase capacity. It has become clear to me that the Core Devs cannot reach a consensus amongst themselves on how to increase capacity, or even whether or not to do it, but they seem happy with the Status Quo as a default fallback plan. I have lost faith in the Core Devs, and so when another option became available, I took it.\n\nReason #2. I believe Bitcoin is here for EVERYONE to participate. I bought into Satoshi's ideal that it would some day be able to handle all of the world's transactions and allow us all to exchange value without trusted intermediaries. I do not want to see Bitcoin become some settlement network nobody can afford to use. I've heard all the theories proposed by the small-blockers about why it'll never be able to do that without centralization.. But they have yet to convince me that anything larger than 1MB will cause unacceptable levels of centralization, especially when the alternative is to force centralization of the userbase by excluding all but the wealthiest Bitcoiners who can afford the highest fees. Several of the Core devs have suggested more conservative approaches than Gavin's 8MB and doubling route, but those approaches are WAY too conservative to be practical. And even amongst themselves, with Gavin and his extreme views taken out of the picture, they can't agree on an approach and go with it. And once again, I say that status quo is not an acceptable fallback plan.\n\nIf the Core devs can get their thumbs out of their asses and come up with a concrete plan to expand capacity NOW at least to 2MB blocks with a reasonable plan to address future growth, then I'll happily support it. But I have lost faith in them. They have all failed.": 6, "Bitcoin, as a currency, IS broken in the sense that with that limit it is just a prototype of a revolutionary thing. Right now it allows for 100 thousand transactions per day, so it could barely run the economy of a *very slow* city of 100 thousand people. If that doesn't send chills down your spine, I don't know what will.": 1, ">  You expand capacity BEFORE\n\nThis is exactly the problem, though.  Very little of the discussion has been about how we expand capacity.  (Lots of talk about removing a limit).\n\nI'm really interested in the actual capacity of the bitcoin network; both figuring out what it is, and what bottlenecks we can eliminate.  I have some ideas, but I'll be flying halfway around the world to ask smarter folks dumb questions about it in Montreal at the Scalability Workshop.": 1, 'everyone created it? one created it': 2, "Yeah.

Do you think that  1MB blocks effects any aspects of adoption? User adoption or merchant adoption? It doesn't. God willing adoption increased 100 fold and it becomes an issue.

I\'m firmly on the side of "get us at least 2MB in a month\'s time so we can be done with the FUD". Any more than that is nice. Any more elegance (dynamic limits based on demand) is nice.

So there is never a reason to vote down.\n\n2) The 32mb limit has often been a criticism of BIP100. It makes sense to grow that limit over time. It will still be a challenge to vote up if it starts chewing up real physical resources that the network can't handle.\n\n3) All the 4x proposals to date rely on miners to vote. So there is no better way to introduce the mechanism better than letting miners have full control over it, but vote each time rather than once, so we can be sure there is no history bias.\n\n4) Even if the core devs disagree, the miners can collude together to do it on their own/hire some contractors to whack in the block size increase and lobby people to use it.

You can ask for a discount from 5% to 50%, but someone has to buy that item for you.  For non gift card items, I've gotten as much as 35% off for books or other small dollar items (under $25).\n\nHowever, you cannot use Amazon Gift Cards to buy other Gift Cards, you can use Amazon credit (which is a different market) so GC's do not come with such a deep discount.  Therefore, when you place an order on PurseIO, deeper discounted items will take much longer, if ever, to find a buyer.  On the other hand, I think if you offer up an 18% to 20% premium for a gift card, you'll find a buyer within a few hours.\n\nIf you have patience, the 25% is possible but it may take a week or so for someone to buy it.  With PurseIO fees (for argument's sake, let's say it's 2% but it's a sliding scale and they take a bigger fee for a bigger discount), the a 25% discount really ends up around 23% give or take.\n\nWhen I first looked at PurseIO, I thought it was crazy and didn't make any sense.  But I've completed over 20 transactions and my SW GC's have all been good so far.  I fly a lot on SW so it makes sense to me to stockpile and have a fair amount at my disposal because I know I'll need it.\n\nWhat the OP has discovered which is great is that GameStop sells Shell GC's (as well as BP) so you can take a GameStop GC and buy a Shell GC.  So you have to sign up for PurseIO, specify the discount you want for a GameStop GC, receive the GameStop GC, go to GameStop, and buy the Shell GC.": 3, 'Love to buy GASOLINE!

I wasn't aware of it til PurseIO came around but some parts of the world get paid in Amazon credits and it costs them 30% to convert it into fiat.  And it takes time and can be rife with fraud.\n\nIf you look at the Amazon Annual Report (and I have), they list $1.7 BILLION dollars on their balance sheet as unrealized income as Gift Cards.  That was up $400 Million over the previous year.  That actually kind of hurts their balance sheet so they are kind of looking the other way at what PurseIO does.  It's beneficial that those unaccrued expenses come off the books.\n\nI've had items bought in the middle of the night which seems to indicate someone halfway across the world is buying items for me to get my BTC.\n\nOne word of advice, the first time you sell through PurseIO, they make you offer only an 8% discount.  That's because people would put up huge discounts and then get disappointed when it would never get picked up and leave the service.  Make a small transaction of $25 or so at 8%.  Once you are successful, then you can name your own discount.  Good luck.": 4, "For those still following this thread, I did a quick experiment.  For the rest of August, Gyft is giving 5% back on Bitcoin purchases.  I purchased a GameStop GC for $25 with 5% back, marched into my nearby GameStop and immediately purchased a $25 Shell GC with the GameStop GC on my Gyft.  So yes, 1% fee buying from Coinbase, 5% back from Gyft, so for a quick purchase I saved myself 4% off on gas.  Still a win in my book.\n\nI've got my GameStop GC orders now up on PurseIO.": 3, 'Thanks for the pro-tip :) /u/changetip gold star': 9, "yeah, it's awesome!

And a deal at Kroger where you got $50 ebay gift card for $40.  So basically got Gamestop gift card for 33% off and any gift card you bought at Gamestop for the same discount.

Now I bought them back when these "bitcoin is splitting" stories come out.  \n\nI will tell anyone that Bitcoin has some great use cases but it is designed for decentralization, not a replacement for other types of financial instruments.  I also think these developer disputes will work out.  If people want to flip out anyway and cause the price to change I am going to profit from it.  ': 3, 'Here\'s the thing. Money\'s value is at least partially correlated with people\'s confidence in it. Confidence in it as a store of value, as it were. The longer bitcoin survives, the more this confidence grows. \n\nDuring times of deep financial uncertainty, people want to put their money somewhere safe. Right now bitcoin is the last place that comes to mind as somewhere "safe" to put your money precisely because everyone knows it could go to zero. But if what you are saying is true, that bitcoin will always be there, will never die, eventually that psychology changes.  Something that never dies is the very definition of something that is safe. \n\nThe price cannot go down forever. Therefore, if bitcoin is going to be around forever, if it is not going to zero, at some point the price must either stabilize or go up. If it stabilizes, then the perception will grow that it is a safe place to put and save your money. The more that perception grows, the more buy pressure, the more the price goes up. \n\nThe problem with saying that bitcoin isn\'t an all-or-nothing scenario, that it could remain what it is today indefinitely, is that it can\'t remain what it is today simply because a critical component of what it is today lies in is its novelty and the uncertainty that comes with that. You remove uncertainty and bitcoin becomes something very different than what it is today.
