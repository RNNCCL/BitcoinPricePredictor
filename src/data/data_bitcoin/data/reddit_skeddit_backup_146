If zero were a number, should it be included in all numeric expressions? We normally think of four as "one less than five," but is it actually "one less than five plus zero?"\n\nEventually, the concept of zero was established as an arithmetic necessity, but early uses were standalone, rather than using it as a digit - this usage was functionally acknowledging the fact that "nothing" is itself a value, which can be the result of an arithmetic operation, and can itself be an operator in an equation with a non-zero result.

I make a payment to you which spends someone\'s segwit funds. Plus I use 51+% hashrate to satisfy your best-work check.\n\n2. You have not upgraded to new segwit rules, so you see my best-work chain spending from some weird, but valid script, that you don\'t care about.\n\n3. Once I got enough confirmations, I put my hashrate back to normal rules. The chain that you accepted is rejected by other miners because it\'s invalid under normal rules.\n\n4. Your payment got reversed.\n\nHow\'s that risk different from risking from normal 51% attack?\n\n1. I can amplify my capital by using anyone\'s funds on new-version txs (not only my own) to double-spend you and/or other non-upgraded parties.\n\n2. I can amplify my hashrate by existing SPV-miners and half-SPV miners (who have not upgraded to new rules, do not include new txs themselves, but trust other miners to validate new txs correctly).\n\nHere are some numbers: https://twitter.com/oleganza/status/685080849642065921\n\nI think the amplification would not be that drastic in practice. In 6 confirmations you still have very low chance of being scammed even with huge amount of hashrate. \n\nThe core problem here is that soft-fork is "censoring" (previously valid txs become rejected) and attack on soft-fork is "uncensoring". Protocol can\'t really force miners not to censor transactions and prevent them from doing soft-fork upgrades. So we, as users of the protocol, should care about our own safety just like we have to care about things like RBF. They can\'t be prevented, so we have to keep software being able to check the risks. Possibilities include:\n\n1. Opt into a hard-fork behavior. If your full node detects new block version, stop processing until you upgrade.\n\n2. Opt into semi-hard-fork behavior. Do not accept confirmations from tx tainted by unknown tx version or unknown script version. Or, simply double required # of confirmations to make attack much more costly. E.g. if your old-rules node would accept tx at 6 confirmations, but you detect new tx version in the chain of txs, then you can require 12 confirmations (until you upgrade to new client). \n\nActually, you can require more confirmations only for new txs in the chain. If you have new tx only somewhere very deep in the chain (say, 1 week ago), but all subsequent txs up to your payment are of new version, then you can require normal number of confirmations for your payment.\n\nI think it\'s a good idea to keep track of confirmation-depth of the unknown txs and scripts in order to bump up this "SPV" security for non-upgraded nodes.\n\n': 4, "I agree, but that's equally relevant for hard forks and 51% attacks too.

We're in absolute agreement regarding the fact that a large hashrate differential is absolutely needed for a soft fork to not be extremely dangerous.\n\nBut if you agree with that, then you also agree it is extremely fucking scary that it is possible to get a large part of the hash rate operators in the same room, at the same time, as happened recently.": 2, 'Re: "without a very large hashrate differential"\n\nLarge hashrate differential is a pre-requisite to call a soft fork being "activated".

We don't need any more payment networks.\n\nWhat we need is market-based money; a unit of account, store of value, and medium of exchange which is separate from the state or any other central entity.\n\nHolding, and the speculation along with the price volatility(gains and losses), are necessary in order to transform a commodity into the most saleable, liquid good; one that becomes the unit of account and is thus supportive of an economy outside of the fiat on and off ramps we use now.\n\nCapital gains reporting requirements and the tax as well are highly destructive to this end, and it has largely been ignored how this has stifled bitcoin's development.\n\nThat's great if Coinbase works for you, but if you're not holding and spending in anticipation of the much higher utility of bitcoin as money, well....value is subjective and you're entitled to have whatever reasoning you want for valuing a slower, less efficient, less user-friendly payment rail. Maybe you just find the tech beautiful or mesmerizing in an of itself, and get a certain thrill from executing a transaction on an immutable public ledger. And I get that.  I feel that way too.  But you have to understand that the aesthetic and curiosity value alone are not going to sustain bitcoin's existence or propel it into a more stable network effect.  Even it's utility as a payment network is only going to make the network (and thus the token) valuable for so long, as the centralized rails catch up to and surpass the particular benefits which bitcoin currently has over mainstream options.\n\nCreating a new money or monetary system is subject to public goods problems.  It's hard to do without a central entity (with force) declaring what we're all going to accept of as unit of account in our trades, and what it's purchasing power will be (at least initially).  Lottery and chance are a time tested method to help groups of people overcome the free-riding and shirking that are naturally going to be associated with the risks and costs of holding onto a commodity for indirect exchange, which very few other people do, and no guarantees of it taking off as a common unit. That's why the volatility and the speculation are important and underly a certain market wisdom: provide incentives for people to make individually irrational, but socially beneficial actions.  By holding bitcoin (especially long-term holding) we are using a commitment strategy to signal to others that there is less risk in assuming that there will be a consumptive end to their investment in bitcoin (which further perpetuates the network effects until such time as the unit becomes fully actualized as the primary medium of exchange and self-perpetuates due to fully closed transaction loops). Satoshi even used this lottery mechanism to ensure that miners would produce the public good of securing the blockchain in decentralized fashion.\n\nThat's really what this whole bitcoin thing is about: it's an experiment to see if we can create, bootstrap, even *will* into existence, a new, independent monetary standard...without a central decree, and despite the crowding out created by the incumbent money and the persecutions which it can level against competing money.": 2, 'The taxman is no problem for customers of Coinbase.

I think we largely think along the same lines, and me too I find bitpay\'s proposal very attractive (maybe the most attractive) for its simplicity and effectiveness. And this is the reason why I am spending so much time for it here in the first place: I would like to see it adopted! But with a small but as I think really really important modification, which should not change the characteristics of how bitpay\'s proposal is intended to work in the network.\n\nI think you (and also Peter__R by the way) have not appreciated enough the inherent conflict between the different (!) **short-term** and **long-term economical optimization functions**, both of which are economical realities that need to be taken into account for a complete economical modelling of the system. This is at the core of my argument, and others refer to this as the "tragedy of the commons", but I prefer the more direct wording "short-term vs. long-term conflict". I encourage everyone to think this through by him/herself and to understand what I mean by this. Otherwise any further discussion is meaningless, because this is the ONLY reason for my amendment proposal.\n\n(\n\nI think that most people who take the "free market" argument [which is a correct argument as such] make the implicit assumption that the SHORT-term decisions that an economical player makes for a certain market variable (here the "block size") is automatically the best long-term decision for the eco-system as a whole. But this, I am sure, is a fallacy, and not only are there plenty of examples and theories, but everybody can also understand this oneself when leaning back and thinking deeply about it. I have elaborated on it a lot [incl. parallels to ecological laws, in case it can be better understood this ways]. Another example from the real world with some analogy is "cheap free hotel rooms": A hotel is not fully booked. Normal prices are 200 USD per night. I come along at 10:00 pm and say: "I would take a room for 80 USD, otherwise I move on." What should the hotel do? If it acted short-term, it would give me the room for 80 USD, this maximizing short-term profits, because the flex-costs of me having the room are only 10 USD for cleaning and usage, if at all.) But long term, this would be a bad decision for the hotel, because I would tell all my friends about this trick and in the future the hotel would have more and more short-term low-paying guests and less normal paying guests, i.e. the economical short-term rational decision destroys the eco-system long-term. Hotels are smart enough to know this and to avoid accepting the 80 USD offer too often. But would miners be similarly smart? I very much doubt it, I think they will only see and optimize for short-term optimization.\n\nThe problem is: **If a miner decides, acc. to absolutely free-market decisions, that his short-term (=for this individual block) gain is maximized for BSL=X, there is no economical connection that says that a block size limit that derives from this short-term decision is the best in the long-term for the eco-system as a whole. Hence these two optimizations MUST be decoupled for a Bitcoin solution to be sustainable and healthy, i.e. the economy [here: the miners] must be able to influence these two optimization targets INDEPENDENTLY from each other [from the targets, not from the miners], if possible. And it is very well possible with the corresponding protocol rules.** (sorry for highlighting)\n\n)\n\nBy the way, I have just made a new post [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/40cm45/a_critical_thought_on_bitcoin_unlimited_bu_peter/) on this topic.\n\nA few short replies/clarifications on your post:\n\n>  What I don\'t like is the complexity [...]\n\nIt is not complex. The exact realization is not important and can be driven by what is most simple. One concrete example (but others may have better ideas): The mentioned "excess fees" of block N (if block N\'s size is > BSL/2) go to the miner of block N +/- delta, where delta is a function of block N\'s hash, acc. to a pre-defined function. (whether "+" or -" delta: whatever is easier to implement) Or it just gets spread-out over the last 10 blocks, simply. ...\n\n> I don\'t treat it like this [like a vote]\n\nWell, if you look at how the protocol (not myself) treats this, it is treated exactly like a vote. Of course your view is perfectly right, too. But viewing it as a vote is also right. I used the model of the "vote" because by this I thought I could more clearly explain my point of the divergence between long-term and short-term interests that are caused by this mechanism of coupling short-term (per-block) incentives (or profit optimization function) with long-term block size limit evolution. After all, you can call it "block size adaptation mechanism as function of actual block sizes" instead of "vote", it makes no difference for my argument - it is just a matter of personal preferences of how to explain things.\n\nOne could argue it is not a "completely free vote", because if memory pool is not full, the miner cannot "vote" for a larger BSL even if he wanted to (neglecting techniques like including self-generated spam transactions to oneself). However, nevertheless I call it vote. Note that due to Poisson distribution statistics one could calculate how big of a fraction of blocks are not full because they are generated too quickly after the previous block... Depending on this result, one might also bias pitpay\'s "voting threshold" to be not the median (=50% quantile) but some other (higher) quantile, to offset this effect, which would be considered a bias towards lower blocks. On the other hand, one could also "price this in" with the choice of the constant multiplier (=2). Some people can make some research on this, but it doesn\'t change the main characteristics of the bitpay proposal, so I do not want to elaborate on this here any further - it distracts from the main point.\n\n> Also flexcap [...]\n\nI don\'t really want to see my proposal compared with flexcap. Flexcap imposes a real and explicit dis-incentive against mining bigger blocks, and thereby it is clearly biased towards keeping small blocks. Also flex-cap is somewhat arbitrary, because we never know (depending on how much dis-incentive is built into a flex-cap protocol) by how much this flex-cap penalty (higher mining difficulty for larger blocks) would offset/(over)compensate the positive incentive of a larger block due to more collected TX fees. My proposal is much more *direct*, because it works on exactly these TX fees themselves, so no further implicit assumptions are needed.\n\nAnother side-remark:\n\n> One can say that miner can start mine next block immediately, because current big one still propagates and have an advantage because of this. But this is doubtful, as there is higher probability of orphaning, as someone can find smaller block and propagate faster at the same time.\n\nIn the first sentence you are raising an interesting point here that I did not have on my (coin)radar myself: Mining a bigger block is not only a disadvantage for the big-block-miner because of orphaning risk (this is the main argument of the BU supporters and Peter__R), but there is also an advantage from being able to mine on this block earlier. If and how these two effects compensate each other is probably a matter of further research. I remember that the "selfish miners" do exactly this: They hold back their own blocks for a while and get an advantage from this (but it only works if they have at least 33% of hash power I think).': 1, '[PART 2 of 2]\n\n[...continued from [part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3zvs8f/a_simple_adaptive_block_size_limit/cyr7aoj)...]\n\n\n> First of all - there might be not enough transactions in the mempool for this.\n\nSure - in my example I took for granted that mem pool is full enough as a pre-condition and I have failed to mention it explicitly.\n\n> Second, max limit can be bigger than average blocks produced and this could be an equilibrium.\n\nSure. But I think I made clear by above example that it would be a big and fortunate coincident when a self-produced blocks size acc. to short term profit considerations produces the best block size vote that this miner considers to be in in the best long-term interests for the eco-system and for himself.\n\n> As you say if miners want to vote for current block size limit of 1Mb the majority of miners just continue mining of 1Mb blocks (no need to reduce it to 50%), limit will be increased to 2Mb in a while based on median of 1Mb, but miners still continue mine 1Mb blocks and market will be stable.\n\nAfter reading my above text, you probably know already my reply to this: Miners to not "want" to mine 1 MB blocks as such in this example. If they can, they might find that 3 MB or even 5 MB maximizes their short-term profit for a self-mined block. But for long-term **sustainability** consideration, they may not want to have a BSL of 2x3=6 or 2x5=10 MB. These are two different optimization problems that are "artificially coupled" by the fixed multiplier of bitpay\'s proposal.\n\nAs a result, the overall system will not work at its "most optimum operational point", so to say.\n\n> Actually as I mentioned in another comment - there are forces moving block size into different sides.\n\nI think I read that one. Of course moving BSL down comes at the expense of forgoing TX fees, which becomes more and more hurtful in the future the more block rewards are replaced by TX fees.\n\nAnd again, as we apply the "median" method, very very low size blocks do not offset my own "too high votes" (or vice verse), all that counts is the number of blocks above or below my own desired BSL.\n\n> Orphan rate will push miners to decrease block size. According to Peter Rizun current orphan rate is 1% of all blocks and this can increase with increased block size. Also this increase will probably be not linear to block size.\n\nI know and I agree. These mechanisms will certainly hamper a too fast, too excessive BSL increase in principle. But it does not say how far away from the optimum operational point the system would converge to. It would certainly not hit the same point as if sustainability-driven (long-term) vote could be independent from the short-term-profit-driven behaviour.\n \n> Jonathan Toomim did some analysis on testnet and it shows that at 8Mb per block Chinese miners will have long propagation times due to Chinese firewall, that means orphan rates can increase a lot motivating them to mine smaller blocks.\n> \n> If the increase from 1Mb to 8Mb block will increase orphan rate from 1% to say 10%, that means 9%*25 BTC (current reward) is 2.25 BTC loss on every mined block on average. Currently transaction fees bring smaller amount to miners than this, so for them it makes sense to ignore fees and rely on reward solely, means to reduce block size and decrease orphan rates.\n> \n> 10% orphan rate is something I just made up and it could be different, but generally the logic works and market will be self-regulating.\n\nYes,  in principle I understand and agree with these self-regulation mecahnisms. Even if your numbers are partly examples/guesses (same as mine), the idea is clear. And it is also clear that changes in the landscape like technological evolution, shift of mining farms towards other geographies/countries, change of TX fee and block reward structures, will shift these self-regulating forces in one direction or another.\n\nFor example, the more TX fees replace block reward in the future, the more hurtful it will be for a miner to "vote" for keeping the block limit, and the more miners will be drawn towards "short-term-thinking egoistic" behaviour and to fill the blocks to the max, thereby increasing the BSL even further (because of the protocol\'s fixed multiplier), until the TX fees get smaller and smaller, this could become a self-enforcing vicious cycle. Not likely to happen any time soon (as long as block rewards still dominate), but we have to look into the future to see if a given solution is suitable for the long-term.\n\n> So the technology will evolve, which will allow to propagate blocks faster, then orphan rate will decrease at same block sizes and then miners will be incentivized to increase block size, because now their marginal gain will be more than marginal loss.\n\nAll agreed. But the trap is that too much "short-term egoistics" may lead into a trap that really endangers Bitcoin, as described above. You can call it "vicious cycle" or "tragedy of commons".\n\n> You know it is kind of basic microeconomics 101 course when they compare marginal cost of production and marginal profits in order to find an optimal production point for manufacturer, but very same logic perfectly applies to block size self-regulation.\n\nThis is also fully clear, and this is what I talking about in the top of this long (sorry) post. This is what I meant when I talked about all the different variables that get "mixed together" in an "optimization function", and the result is an optimum block size or optimum block size limit. My point is that...\n\n* ...the "optimization function" for the short-term (=best size of a self-mined block) and\n\n* ...the "optimization function" for the long-term system stability/sustainability as a whole (=best block size limit)\n\nare much more different than what one would think at first glance. However, the "bitpay\'s" protocol proposal couples these two: Every short-term economical decision (self-mined block size) is at the same time translated into a long-term strategy decision for the Bitcoin system as a whole, by means of the "fixed multiplier", which may lead into catastrophe unless the majority of miners is altruistic (which cannot be expected).\n\nHence a long-term protocol proposal should be designed that decouples these two factors, or in other words, a proposal should not suffer the "tragedy of commons". One possibility is via voting (like in BIP-100, or better and much favoured by myself, the further developed but apparently little acknowledged [BIP-100.5](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3vkuf6/bip1005_progressive_block_size_limit_evolution/)).\n\nAnother possibility is to amend bitpay\'s proposal only slightly, as I explained [here in this thread - 2nd link of this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3zvs8f/a_simple_adaptive_block_size_limit/cyqv25z). This will have almost no effect today (as block rewards dominate over TX fees) but it will avoid the possibly disastrous tragic pitfall for the future. This is achieved in that a short-term decision for a self-mined block size between current_BSL/2 and current_BSL (corresponding to a BSL vote between current_BSL and 2 times current_BSL) creates the same miner reward from TX fees for the miner of this block. So the decision for whether the miner votes for a BSL that lies between current BSL or 2 times current BSL can be made independent from short-term profit considerations and solely based on long-term strategic considerations. The "not immediately paid out" part of the ~~block reward~~ *TX fees* *(typo corrected)* is paid out to other miners in a random or pre-determined fashion, so the miners as a whole do get their fair share, no Tx fees vanish in limbo. But the incentives are now decoupled between long- and short-term interests.\n\nWith this small but decisive amendment to bitpay\'s proposal, I consider it an enormously powerful yet stunningly wonderful and simple method.': 1, 'Bitcoin Unlimited makes the cap configurable by the node/miner on an individual basis such that a concensus cap is emergent in the market.': 5, 'Hello /u/GentlemenHODL\n\ngoldcakes wrote:\n\n>Flexcap adds a difficulty constraint to make finding larger blocks take longer. As you might have figured, the difficulty constraint is artificial and decided by ~~core developers~~ Blockstream as a magic constraint.\n\nYes. Flexcap means more precisely that a miner who wants to mine a block greater than the current "nominal" block size limit has to achieve a higher difficulty than what is the current "nominal" difficulty. This "punishes" and disincentivises block limit increases pretty much. Note that a miner has to decide upfront what kind of block he is mining for: Example: Current \'nominal\' difficulty threshold=2000. Miner decides to mine for a larger block, such that a higher difficulty with threshold=1800 applies. Now while mining and hashing, if he happens to create a hash=1900, that\'s bad luck. He cannot just say now *"oh ok, I change my mind and will broadcast this block as \'normal\' block now with hash=1900 satisfying the nominal threshold of 2000."* So unless tx fees are really high, this flexcap will not be enough incentive for making mining larger blocks (incorporating extra transactions) economical.\n\nTo be honest, also bitpay\'s proposal includes a magic constant, which is the fixed multiplier for the hard limit, i.e. if a miner creates a block of actual size 2MB, this is automatically interpreted by the (bitpay proposal\'s) protocol as a vote for a block size limit of 4MB (assuming fixed multiplier=2). But this is not necessarily the miner\'s intention. The miner might be perfectly happy with 2MB and creates a 2MB block to collect all the tx fees, but a general sustaining 4MB block size limit (and actual blocksizes correspondingly high) might be too much for this miner to handle. So this miner, if he wanted to express his opinion via this "implicit voting mechanism", had to mine a block of only 1MB size, equating to a vote for 2MB bl.sz.limit. But this means he would loose (forego) revenues from tx fees.\n\nSo to summarize:\n\n* While flexcap punishes large blocks that are greater than current nominal block size limit,\n\n* bitpay\'s proposal punishes (implicit) votes for block sizes < "2 times current block size limit" (if hard coded "hard limit" multiplier==2.\n\nBut I already have an idea how bitpay\'s drawback can be improved: By adding a simple mechanism similar to the **rollover fees**, inspired by [Meni Rosenfeld\'s proposal](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1078521.0): Explanation - further assuming that hard multiplier=2: Introduce the following modification: The transaction fees for the first "blockSizeLimit/2" MB go directly to the miner of block "N", as usual. The tx fees for transactions beyond that do not go to this miner directly, but go to a "rollover pool" and get paid out to future miners acc. to a certain schedule to be defined (even simpler: could also get paid out to a previous block\'s miner "N-delta", where delta (out of 1..12096 or so) is randomly calculated from the block hash). This would reduce the disincentive for voting for blockSizeLimits < 2*currentBlockSizeLimit, it would remove the "tragedy of commons" problem of bitpay\'s proposal.\n\n[In this post of mine](http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3zvs8f/a_simple_adaptive_block_size_limit/cyqpqx1) I comment further on this problem of bitpay\'s proposal.': 1, 'Therfore they must be banned ': 4, 'Ok, I think now I understood our different viewpoint a bit better:\n\n**You think** that any transactions, no matter how little TX fees they have, should be accommodated in blocks ("should" in the sense of "it is desirable for the Bitcoin eco-system" as a whole), as long as there is enough short-term incentive for a miner to do so. In other words: Only if the cost of TX inclusion in the very next block that a miner is about to mine would exceed the incremental gain from adding that given low-fee transaction (due to orphan probability or bandwidth cost for sending out this particular TX, or permanent storage of this few kB TX), the miner should always add all transactions until the mem pool is empty (more or less). In this situation (which is the base of your view) I agree with your statement that typically *"there will be no that many transactions to fill the block size fully"*. And you would probably call such miner behaviour, as I just described it, "economically rational" and "smart". I would also call it "economically rational", but I wouldn\'t call it "smart" ("smart" in the same sense as it is *not* necessarily smart when a hotel gives a $200/night room to a last minute guest at 11pm for only $50 when the room would otherwise remain empty. Even though economically rational (short term profit maximization, I assume flex costs are << $50), not smart, because in the long-term that could spoil the market of hotel business revenues).\n\nIt is very clear that such economical incentive structure for miners, as described in last paragraph, will cause TX prices go down *extremely*, and in the end miner revenues will get reduced, and as a result miners switch off, hash rate reduces, implying that the Bitcoin system becomes more and more insecure. Miners could only change this trend if they somehow "self-limited" themselves (all rules for everyone) from only profit-optimizing for the short-term (=for the very next block), by setting thresholds/agreement/however-you-call-it to avoid price runs towards diminishing fees. Because many Bitcoin market participants would well be ready to pay 2 cents TX fee, but if they can get the same service for 0.5 cent, they will not pay 2 cent voluntarily. So we need a rule structure to get back to the 2 cent point (but not to the $2 point though! - this would drive users away to competing systems and not benefit the Bitcoin eco-system!). I am offering a solution for this.\n\n**My view** is that the miners should have a means (provided by the protocol rules of course) that optimizes their long-term profits by imposing such limits, in a way that is **independent (i.e. not in conflict)** with the short-term (=per block) optimization - as simple as that. Only then the miners are even allowed(!) to be "smart" in all respects, because they do not have to make compromises between different optimizations targets and are not subject to game theoretical considerations for which no objective optimum solution exists. \n\nSo you can call it "fee market" if you want, that I want to be established, but I do not even remotely arrive at the extreme views observable in many core devs views, and especially such fee market will only establish itself in the far future when mining rewards have dropped considerable - and by that time hopefully the Bitcoin system is big enough in terms of volume (block size, TX/sec) such that moderate TX fees can replace today\'s block rewards and Bitcoin is still stable and secure. While some "small blockists" want to enforce a "radical" fee market by enforcing small block size limits, I want a fee market that also works with block size limits, but where the block size limit height is found by economical forces rather than by ideological view of programmers.\n\nOur different views also explain to some extend **different views on mem pool occupancies** (whether there are *"that many transactions to fill the block size fully"*, as you say):\n\nIn "your model", the mem pool will typically be rather empty most of the time after a block has been mined, because the miner will typically include (almost) all, also extremely low-fee TX, up until the point where fees are uneconomically *for this particular block*.\n\nIn "my model", a block size limit is in place at any given point in time, and the fee market (which exists in either model) will converge to higher (but still far from prohibitive) fees then in your model. Miners will of course include the highest fee TXs first, until the respective block hits its max size. Other TXs remain in the mem pool. This way, low fee TXs are not typically included in the very next block(s). However, sometimes, two (or more) blocks are mined shortly one after another (it happens due to Poisson probabilities), or sometimes there are times with less new TXs being generated. A block that is mines during such times will include also the lower fee TXs from the mem pool that former blocks have been rejecting. So in my model it is very typical that the mem pool is never really empty, because many low-prio (=low fee) TXs reside in the mem pool as a kind of backup "buffer". So it is much more typical in my model that blocks can actually be filled more or less all the time. This is why I did not spend too much effort about the minority of blocks that are not really full.\n\n*Edit: To add on complexity:*\n\n*OK, it is a matter of perception what is complex or not. I consider my proposal sill "KISS enough" if it brings a sustainable solution. It appears like a very elegant solution to me with much lower complexity than some explicit voting mechanisms (BIP100/100.5), while still being able to achieve essentially the same thing, plus the added feature that votes are not entirely decoupled from actual block sizes, which is also nice (while short-long-incentive structure IS decoupled, which is very important of course!). Since I am convinced that the "tragedy of the commons" problem must be solved in a sustaining Bitcoin protocol version, I consider my proposal the "KISS-est" way I can think of so far. I agree that any added complexity must be well justifiable, and for this one I see the justifiability absolutely given.*\n\nQuestion: **What is your vision of the future** *with the "pure" bitpay proposal: Imagine a future world with very high bandwidths everywhere and very huge storage hard drives, and block rewards have dropped to nearly zero. Now from the economical forces, the incremental costs for miners to include an additional TX are extremely low. So the TX fees are also extremely low, as a result of that. My example from above applies: Maybe a typical TX would be 0.5 cent, even though Bitcoin users would readily pay 2 or 3 cent if they had to (and would not run away to VISA or Litecoin). But due to the fee market that establishes is this scenario, we end up with these very low TX fees (lower than what users would be willing to pay), thereby arriving way beyond the point that would maximize Bitcoin miners\' revenues. This situation would continue as technology evolves: 0.5 cent --> 0.1 cent, etc., because the incremental costs for TX inclusion become lower and lower. the user base would increase much slower (not 5-fold as TX fees drop from 0.5 to 0.1 cent), because the market is already almost saturated at 0.5 cent. So all that the technology progress gives us is smaller incremental TX block inclusion costs, hence smaller TX fees, hence lower miner revenues, and HENCE(!) CONTINUOUSLY DECREASING BITCOIN NETWORK SECURITY. Soon we will hear some voices saying: "we need another emission schedule, the inflation free model of Bitcoin has failed, it endangers Bitcoin\'s security". But these voices are wrong of course. In fact, what has failed is the fee market, because the fee market was only driven by technological evolutions coupled with short-term economical incentives, and not by (long-term!) economical optimizations.*': 1, "You're right, it doesn't have anything to do with BIP101 really (at the moment).": 10, '[Text too long, so I have to split into two parts]\n\n[PART 1 of 2]\n\nHello coinradar, thanks for this qualified answer - more of this would be good for this subreddit.\n\nFirst of all - just for the record/reference - the other posts of mine that I was referring to are:\n\n* [This](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3zvs8f/a_simple_adaptive_block_size_limit/cyqpqx1) (elaborating on tragedy of commons), and\n\n* [This](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3zvs8f/a_simple_adaptive_block_size_limit/cyqv25z) (suggesting adding partial "rollover fee" machanism to bitpay\'s proposal).\n\nPlease read my post slowly and if necessary twice - I think it is really important to understand certain hidden "long-term" pitfalls.

Why?\n\nLet\'s take an example, taken not necessarily from today (with Chinese firewall restrictions etc.), but from any future point in time with any arbitrary geographical split of miners in the world:\n\nAssume I am a miner operator. I have certain bandwidth and CPU costs and restrictions, and there is a certain combination of block rewards and TX fees, and my mining company\'s market research has extrapolated how TX fees, bitcoin price etc. would evolve under various different scenarious. Now, based on this I want to optimize the revenues (or rather: profits = earnings minus costs) of my business. After putting all input data together, I come to the conclusion that:\n\n* For the next 6 months or so, my business would run most optimum if block size limit ("bsl") remains at 2 MB where it is right now (just an example). For a greater limit (and hence greater avg. blocks that I have to transfer through my fibres and validate in my CPUs etc.) I expect lower income from fees, higher costs for bandwidth, and disadvantages through longer validation times of foreign blocks. Otherwise, 1 MB would lead to increase of TX fees driving users away from bitcoin, causing price pressure, less users etc. So 2 MB is quite optimum for now.\n\n* So I would like to be able to vote for "2 MB". Clearly, since the votes are evaluated by the median (50% quantile) method [which I am a big proponent of by the way], the best I could do to achieve this is to cast a vote for exactly this "2 MB". *Note: Gaming the system by voting overly high or low thereby offsetting other votes makes no sense - this would only work with the averaging method, but not with the median method*. To do this acc. to "the bitpay-protocol\'s" proposed rules, I have to produce blocks with a size of 2MB / 2 = 1 MB.\n\n* So far for the long-term strategy. Now the short-term strategy:\n\n* As a miner, I am trying to produce blocks myself. Here I a also make calculations to optimize my business: How large should the blocks be in an optimum case (assuming the mem pool is large enough)?  Also now I take all the different input variables into account, but the optimization functions are different ones and naturally I will come up with a different value. For example, bandwidth cost for own blocks (which are generated say once in 4 hours or so depending how big of a miner I am) play less of a role then what foreign blocks contribute. Also the macro-economical impact on user satisfaction etc. is different when considering my own blocks than all blocks, because I am just a small miner with a 1-digit percentage of hash power. Orphaning probabilities as a fucntion of my block size and TX fees also are inputs to this equation. After all, I get to the conclusion that I should mine blocks as large as possible (maybe the "break-even" acc. to this calculation is only at 5 MB, after which orphaning rate starts to limit my profits if I mined even larger blocks).\n\n* Now, since the current bsl is at 2 MB, I will naturally generate full 2 MB blocks if possible, acc. to this short-term profit optimization formulas.\n\nNow the problem is: Since the protocol tightly couples the short-term and the long-term optimization (by the fixed multiplier of "2"), I cannot optimize my short-term profit and my long-term vote at the same time, which is a pity.\n\nOf course above numbers are EXAMPLES. But it should be clear that is would be a big coincidence if both optimization calculations (in combination with the fixed arbitrary multiplier value of "2") yields the same optimum. So by nature of how things are, there will virtually always be a conflict that the short-term optimum (=best size for a self-mined block) does not match the preferred voting behaviour reflecting the best long-term evolution of the system.\n\nWe can even have the paradox situation that all miners do the same calculation as I do (let\'s assume there are 20 pools all having 5% market share, I am one of them), and each of them ends up producing 2 MB blocks (i.e. all optimize the short-term profit) and hope that their vote (since they make up only 5%) is anyway not so relevant. So for each of them individually it is best to optimize the short-term profit and ignore the fact that the vote that they cast by this decision is not exactly what they prefer most. --> As a result, the bsl will increase towards 10 MB, although NONE of the miners actually wanted that to happen. Had they been able to cast a vote for the long-term bsl evolution independently from their short-term profits, they had all voted for a 2 MB block size limit, but the protocol did not allow them to do so. Very much like all the [factories polluting the air](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3zvs8f/a_simple_adaptive_block_size_limit/cyqpqx1) although all of them would welcome a law acc. to which all factories would be mandated to install exhaust filters - a classical situation for the "tragedy of commons".\n\nI hope this was understandable ?:-)\n\n[...continued in [part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3zvs8f/a_simple_adaptive_block_size_limit/cyr7b92)...]': 1, "> I would say a simplified and non gameable version of bip100\n\nCan someone who is more familiar with the flexcap proposals than I please differentiate the technical differences and perceived merits of this proposal vs current flexcap BIP's?\n\nI will happily changetip you dollar for a thorough accurate response.": 1, "Rollover fees no longer effectively penalize 0 transaction mining.

You misunderstood me on this. For the debate to stay factual, we should try not to misquote each other. I didn\'t say that miners will include all arbitrarily low fees in "your scenario". On the contrary, I mentioned instead explicitly the incremental costs of including a TX as the criterion for the minimum fee needed to be included in a certain block. And I said that naturally, as technology evolves further, these incremental costs (and thereby also the TX fees) can only decrease.

That\'s the starting point (not the end-point) of my argument that a market that is driven by these short-term incentives alone ends up with fees (and hence overall miner revenues) that are much lower than what is optimum for the health (profitability) of the eco-system.\n \n>> Because many Bitcoin market participants would well be ready to pay 2 cents TX fee, but if they can get the same service for 0.5 cent, they will not pay 2 cent voluntarily. So we need a rule structure to get back to the 2 cent point (but not to the $2 point though! - this would drive users away to competing systems and not benefit the Bitcoin eco-system!).\n> \n> I don\'t get the logic here, why you want to go to 2 cents, but not to 0.5 cent? I think differently here. Also how do you decide that 2 cents is ok, and $2 is too big?\n\nThese figure were meant to be illustrative examples to make my principle point clear in few words. Don\'t take the 0.5 cent or 2 cent figures too literal.\n\n> I don\'t care if the fee becomes $15. But only if this increase happens due to market natural conditions, e.g. huge adoption, technology is not enough to cover growth speed, miners can\'t propagate bigger blocks, they just increase minimum fees they want transactions to have. If it grows to $15 because of this - then ok, there will be less people using the system, transactions number decrease, fees decrease.\n\nI fully agree with this "side" (or case) of the scenario - i.e. the case where technology (like bandwidth etc.) is not [yet] ready to provide huge TX/s capacity, so TX fees would increase. This would be no different in my model. Because in this case the optimum TX fee acc. to short-term incentive (or in other words: the incremental costs for TX inclusion into a block) would be the limiting factor for the blocks size, and not the long-term incentives.\n\n> This is market, it will self-regulate. Technology will improve, and the same transaction volume will be less costly to mine - then fees for customers decrease, new customers jump on board.\n\nExactly. And this is where I continued to visualize where this situation leads to (and again I am repeating myself): Incremental costs of inclusion of a TX into a block decrease over time from $15 over $2 to 2 cent to 0.5 cent to 0.1 cent... [just example(!) figures!]. With the self-regulating market incentive structure in place in your model, every miner will incorporate almost(!) all TX fees up to(!) these lower and lower limits [of course some will draw the line at 0.1 cent, others at 0.3 cent - not all are exactly the same, but this makes no difference in principle]. These limits are so low because technology has improved so much.\n\n> Same in the scenario of short-term vs. long-term goals. As you say, short-term they want more profits, include everything, users set lower fees, profits of miners fall, there are less miners as some need to close mining, other set minimum required fees, rest miners adjust fee pricing, fee increase, the higher the fees new miners come, etc.\n\nExactly right, up to the point where you say *"[...] need to close mining"*. Then you are a little too quick in your next half-sentence and miss exactly the point that I was making. Re-think: Why do you think other miners would then suddenly adjust TX fees upwards again in this case (in your scenario). The incentive structure has not changed just because some miners have closed. Still the incremental cost of inclusion of a TX into a block is the same as it was before the other miners have closed down. So the minimum TX fee for which it is economical to include a TX into a block is the same as before, so there is no market force that would suddenly drive fees up again.\n\nThis is exactly where my long-term incentive mechanism comes into play: If there is a mechanism in place by which the miners can have a mutual agreement to limit the block size of every single block, they create a scarcity of the network\'s TX/s capacity. By this we end-up at TX/s capacity "B" instead of "A", with B<A.\n\n> I don\'t see any contradiction, just let market decide where the equilibrium is.\n\nThat is always the basic misconception about my proposal: Proponents of the "free market ideal" think that I am introducing some extra rules that stand against the *free market*, and are hence *uneconomical* and cannot give the *best result* for the eco-system. They think that always "simpler is better" in terms of play of market forces. But this view is too simplified, because when we make the real effort to think the whole thing through, we see that the "free market", without such rules, cannot be economical, even if it wants to. Because it is in the conflict between short- and long-term optimization. **Only by giving the free market a TOOL to optimize the long-term incentives independently from the short-term incentives, the market actors can really behave truly economical.**\n\n[...continued in [Part 2](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3zvs8f/a_simple_adaptive_block_size_limit/cyurou2)]': 1, "I don't see where you're getting ideas like needing to meet up and collude between miners to come to a decision about what is right, or this idea of voting ahead of moving to market.\n\nBU removes this entirely.

I do not intend to discuss any Meni Rosenfeld solution here, I just wanted to acknowledge Meni's work/idea and therefore mentioned him.*": 1, 'Yes fuck market solutions. I would like rules determined by regulators ': 2, 'I also find this proposal interesting and worth considering. However I don\'t think it is a mix of BIP-100 and BIP-101. I think the best mix of those two BIPs is [BIP-100.5](https://github.com/1MichaS1/BIP100dotFive/blob/master/README.md).\n\nThere is also another BIP proposal in this author\'s github repositories called [BIP-10X](https://github.com/1MichaS1/BIP10X-Hybrid-Bitcoin-Block-Size-Limit-Adjustment) which is more complicated and also takes the blocks actual sizes into consideration, similarly to bitpay\'s proposal.\n\nAs usual, all proposals have pros&cons. Bitpay\'s proposal shines for its simplicity. However, it may suffer the "**tragedy of the commons**", because actual block sizes themselves *are* the miner votes. This may lead to the following situation:\n\nA miner would *generally* prefer to *keep* the current block size limit as it is (at least for a while), because of his own judgement of the eco-system\'s situation, his bandwidth, etc. So he prefers that the block size limit shall not increase too much too quickly. However, when it comes to mining an *actual* block, his economical incentive structure in this concrete situation is very short-term and he will be incentivised to fill this block completely to maximize short-term miner fees.\n\nNow, by filling this block completely he has automatically casted a vote to raise the future block size limit by two (fixed x2 multiplier in the protocol for the hard limit). So he is in conflict! If he wanted to cast a vote for "keep current block size limit" he had to create a block whose size is only 50% of the current block size limit, but then he would stay 50% below what he considers optimum himself. So whatever he does, it is not in his best personal interest, he is **forced to make a compromise between his own short- and long-term interests** because of the way the protocol rules are defined (i.e because he **cannot decouple long-term voting from short-term optimization**).\n\nAn analogy to this "tragedy of commons" conflict of own interests is e.g. standards of environmental protection: In short term, a company (or even a whole state) may be interested to *not* increase such standards, because it is a burden that costs money and hence reduces profits and hence reduces wages and hence living standards of the company\'s owners/the state\'s population. However, generally everybody wants to live in a more healthy environment and is willing to pay for it if the other participants in the economy do the same. So they can cast a vote for a green party in the next elections to achieve this while continuing their daily profit-oriented business as usual, and once new laws pass the legislation, every economic participator (and competitor) abides to these rules equally.\n\nI think the analogy to Bitcoin is crystal clear and valid, and therefore my opinion is that it is better to decouple short term and long term optimization by including an element of voting (either like bip-100.5, or including actual block size as a constraint in voting like in bip-10X). *EDIT: [Here I proposed a simple improvement](http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3zvs8f/a_simple_adaptive_block_size_limit/cyqv25z) to bitpay\'s proposal to eliminate the "tragedy of the commons" problem.*\n\nNot decoupling this is like saying: "We don\'t need stronger environmental laws, because if people (incl. factory owners) want to breath fresher air, they can simply install filters themselves. And if they don\'t install exhaust gas cleaning filters volontarily this equates to a vote against stronger environmental laws. So we don\'t need separate elections, because people are already voting implicitly by the way they behave." - and clealy, this does not work, as explained.\n': 2, 'In BU, the capacity of the network is actually determined by the available capacity supplied by the market.\n\nFor example, if the "sweet spot" is actually a 6.5Mb blocksize limit for March to July 2017, but then closer to 7Mb the rest of the year, the only way that level of precision is possible is with BU.': 2, 'But this proposal is not able to differentiate short- and long-term interests, which is a problem referred to as "tragedy of the commons". I have explained it in another, longer, post in this thread and made the analogy to environmental protection, to make it more clear what this is about.': 1, "And DDoS'd!": 1, 'Thanks for such a detailed reply.\n\nHere are my thoughts in short:\n\n1) Your ideas make sense. What I don\'t like is the complexity, especially with split of fees for current coinbase transaction and future ones of other miners (if I understood it correctly). This basically changes the protocol quite substantially. Now it is very simple - you found a block = get reward 25 BTC + fees of your mined transactions, which go to your coinbase UTXO.\n\nWhen you start to split - questions arise, which transactions\' fees give to you as a miner, which leave for future, also who in the future will get it. This is quite complex even from logic, as well as implementation.\n\nAnd in the basic way it adds "artificial restriction", similar to set 1MB limit now. Also flexcap which you mentioned in another post, which says - that for bigger blocks there should be higher difficulty is the same "artificial restriction". I mean they are not that restricting as 1mb limit, because they still allow to grow, however, they are disincetivising blocks to grow in non-natural way.\n\n2) You look at current size of blocks mined in bitpay proposal as a "vote" (similar as in BIP 100), but I don\'t treat it like this. Median moving max block limit is just an extra space added above current average block in order to handle bigger/peak number of transaction, but normally the block size will be based on the current bitcoin economy requirements. It is like VISA processes bigger volume on black friday, so there will be a space for these short high-volume periods. So basically block size will settle itself at level of economic activity in bitcoin (number of transaction), leaving some space above it for extraordinary high volume. This is not something like in 6 weeks (bitpay puts 2 week median for increase) from now we will have 8Mb blocks, this will not happen because there are not so many transactions. You say you assume that there are enough transactions to fill the full limit of block - but I find this as a very inaccurate assumption, far from reality. Here I talk about natural economy growth.\n\nOf course, there can be spam transactions (which can be easily solved by limits on min fees by miners), also the spam attack should happen over long period (in order for block limit to increase), which will be costly. That\'s why I think it makes sense to have these 2 weeks in bitpay proposal to increase, but this is point to discussion, because a balance to be found, as too long period - will make the limit not flexibly adjusted when needed. I think 2016 blocks from bitpay proposal are coming from the same period for difficulty recalculation.\n\nAnother artificial transactions peak could be because miners will include their own transactions in order to artificially increase block size, so to kill the competition. To be honest I understood this threat but only to small extent. Miners will have higher costs for storage, bandwidth. Also the propagation time will increase. One can say that miner can start mine next block immediately, because current big one still propagates and have an advantage because of this. But this is doubtful, as there is higher probability of orphaning, as someone can find smaller block and propagate faster at the same time. Also in the end response can be symmetric, as someone will be able to also find big block, hence making this miner in disadvantageous situation using same logic.\n\n3) Maybe bitpay proposal is not ideal, but to my mind this is one of the best alternatives we have now described. I don\'t like artificial set of increases like BIP101 as it can go far beyond the market needs and then some attack might be executed (e.g. when block was increased to the size when technology has not evolved yet). However, the steady self-regulating size makes so much sense. Also the increases like 2-4-8 from Adam Back when he still suggested it - also doesn\'t make sense, as it is a temporary measure, it is just postponing it for several years, and then we are back to the problem again. Bitpay proposal makes it kind of fix forever, this will adjust in the future, like the difficulty adjusts now. So market grows, the block size limit will grow as well (hopefully technology will support it growth). If technology isn\'t that fast and makes it hard to run at that block size, there is still a way to limit this by miners simply by mining smaller blocks than max limit and in this case natural fee market will evolve, not the artificial fee market which is suggested now. And the majority of miners will route the best path.': 1, 'What will be the reasoning to make blocks very small for miners? Looks like there are two forces, one leads to block increase (more transactions, more fees), another moves blocksize smaller (better propagation speed=>lower risk of orphaning, less hardware space to store blockchain), so basically market will find equilibrium, and this is great proposal.': 2, 'The problem though is that a miner who is "too progressive" can never be sure if his (bigger) block will be accepted by other miners or get orphaned (unless it has been ensured by (secret?) talks between mining pool leaders that blocks up to x MB will be accepted by anyone. This is not the open system I want Bitcoin to be. Hence I definitly prefer to have a blocksize limit defined by the protocol\'s mechanisms.\n\nFrom what I understood, bitpay\'s line of argument goes in the same direction.\n\nQuoting from bitpay\'s linked post:\n\n> While Bitcoin could work without a preset fixed limit, that would leave a lot of *uncertainty for miners*. It is useful for miners to know the limit that is observed by a majority of the mining power and that we have a clear and simple consensus rule for it.': 2, 'I think it implies that they are ready to upgrade at any time.': 17, "The blocksize can only be 0.01mb small if 51% of the miners want it to be 0.01mb.\n\nThe blocksize can only be 10000TB if 51% of the miners want it to be 10000TB. \n\nYou can only game if you have 51% of the network.\n\nAnd don't forget that miners have a hure incentive to keep bitcoin as valuable as possible, otherwise their blockreward and asic miners will be worthless. ": 3, '[Part 2 of 2] (Part 1 is [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3zvs8f/a_simple_adaptive_block_size_limit/cyurj6w))\n\nFinally I\'d like to illustrate the situation by a concrete examples with numbers (all figures are just examples - not to be taken too literal) - this may clarify the point better than many words:\n\nImagine that the Bitcoin eco-system has the following parameters at some future point in time (for the sake of explaining the principles, I assume that all TXs have the same fee and that all miners have the same cost structure - the argument in principle still holds for a more realistic situation):\n\n* (a) Market demand for Bitcoin transactions is 8 TX/s for a TX price of 50 cent per TX.\n\n* (b) Market demand for Bitcoin transactions is 100 TX/s for a TX price of 5 cent per TX.\n\n* (c) Market demand for Bitcoin transactions is 300 TX/s for a TX price of 1 cent per TX.\n\n* (d) Market demand for Bitcoin transactions is 1000 TX/s for a TX price of 0.2 cent per TX.\n\n* (e) Market demand for Bitcoin transactions is 1900 TX/s for a TX price of 0.001 cent per TX.\n\n* Due to the state of technology, the incremental cost for including an extra TX into a block is equal to 0.18 cent.\n\nQuestion: Where would the eco-system converge to, when following economical rules? Answer: It depends on the economical framework. We consider three cases:\n\n* **Framework 1: Free market and many small decentralized mining pools**: Each miner behaves economically rational by maximizing his profits for the very next mined block in a short-term egoistic fashion. So he will include all TXs from the mem pool as long as their fees are higher than his incremental costs of including a TX. Since 0.2 cent > 0.18 cent, he will include even TX as cheap as 0.2 cent TX fee. With this low level of fees we get a market demand of 1000 TX/s. As a result, the eco-system as a whole will generate revenues of 1000 * (0.2-0.18) cent / sec = $0.20 / sec (from this the fixed-cost still have to be subtracted).\n\n* **Framework 2: Same as framework 1, but the miners have a tool to optimize long-term revenues (my proposal)**: Each miner operator is aware of the situation acc. to (a) - (e) from market research. Hence the miners agree (via blocksize limit vote, physical meet-up or whatever) to limit the block size such that the network capacity is "artificially" constrained to 100 TX/s. This will raise the TX fee on the market to 5 cent/TX. As a result, the eco-system as a whole will generate revenues of 100 * (5.0-0.18) cent / sec  = $4.82 / sec  (from this the fixed-cost still have to be subtracted).\n\n* **Framework 3: Free market, but one mining pool has 100% of hash power (monopol)**: Here the miner is no longer pushed to make short-term (and thus short-sighted) decisions. Since he IS the eco-system, he can make long term strategic decisions and set the minimum fee that he is willing to accept to a value well above his incremental costs per TX, if he thinks this is beneficial long-term for him. So he comes up with the same result as in framework 2: He selects 5 cents /TX and he will thus generate revenues of 100 * (5.0-0.18) cent / sec  = $4.82 / sec  (from this the fixed-cost still have to be subtracted).\n\nNote 1: I am omitting the fixed costs, because they are the same for all cases and hence irrelevant for the purpose of comparison.\n\nNote 2: The effect of increasing Bitcoin price for higher TX/s capacity (=higher utility) is neglected in above example. It would in practice push the optimum network capacity towards slightly higher values, as long as block-rewards are non-negligible.\n\n. . .\n\n> Your proposition might be meaningful, just put it as a BIP and suggest to devs. If there is enough support it could be evaluated, there is not really much sense to prove it only to me.\n\nI agree. But you are a good "sparring partner" (I mean this positive) to test and see how difficult it might be to explain and convince somebody who has not yet thought in that direction. So thank you for taking the time and trying to follow my points (even if you sometimes missed something although I had written it - I am sure it was not due to bad intentions but due to "too much text" from my side, such that the reader sometimes misses to see the trees in the presence of too much forest).': 1, 'BU has no predictability.': 0, 'I would say a simplified and non gameable version of bip100': 22, 'Hmm, so the main concern is the short term peaks, that bitpay\'s proposal cannot handle. My opinion is that such short-term-peaks should be handled via TX fees, the other transactions then have to wait a bit. And hopefully the completely uncritical FSS(!)-RBF and CPFP are supported by that time for all transactions as standard.\n\nThe bottleneck would not stay forever, because bitpay\'s auto-adaptation mechanism will take care that system capacity adapts, so we are not stuck in a "small-blocker\'s trap" and have no fee-market dreamer\'s "permenantly small blocks with excessive TX fees".\n\nWhat I don\'t like about BU (bitcoin without any protocol-wise defined block size limit) - and I said it several times at various occasions today and over the recent months - is that miners CEOs/CTOs would have to agree what they will be willing to accept as max. block size for the time to come. While this "could" perhaps work, it is much better to build this mechanism into the system, because then it is formalized, avoids arguments and heated debates if miner CTOs cannot agree in their regular meetups, and does not leave small miners (who are not invited to the big miner\'s meetups) aside.. The meetup between the CTO is factually nothing different than voting anyway. So if we are honest, BU implies that voting happens as a matter of fact (because someone has to "decide" in your example that the max accepted size that will not get orpahned by the mining community is raised form 17 to 20 MB), just not voting in the protocol, but rather invisibly in secret. That\'s not where I want Bitcoin to be.\n\nBut if we accept anyway that voting takes place, it is better to include it into the protocol, like in bitpay\'s proposal, or like in BIP-100 (or the improved and much-preferred but rarely mentioned [BIP-100.5](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3vkuf6/bip1005_progressive_block_size_limit_evolution/)), or [BIP-10X](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3jvb0i/bip10x_a_hybrid_mechanism_for_blocksizelimit/) (which also contains a short term overload treatment by the way) from the same author as bip-100.5, or others.': 1, 'The problem with flex cap that I see is just plain why. Technology improves over time according to Moore\'s law, and what nodes can handle over time improves. That logically means block sizes improve over time.

My view is that miners on their own can decide on fees threshold which tnxs to include. So it is not that every miner will include all tnxs from mempool, but the one who wants to do it. It is similar to how it is now, there is minimum recommended fee based on transaction size, but there are miners who still can mine it with 0-fees. Same approach stays the same for the future. Miners on their own decide what to include and every miner has his own economic incentive to maximize his profits.\n\nAddressing your question about the future, when hardware costs are small, badnwidth costs small, there are still rent to be paid, electricity etc. In the end of the day, if there is literally 0-costs to run mining farm (not real case), there is still minimum profit amount miners want to earn, so they can't include only 0-fee transaction in order to run mining equipment, they still need to be profitable. So if all transactions on network become 0-fee, miners will be incentivized to set the minimum, and this is how fees will increase.\n\nSo basically general approach - let the market decide what the equilibrium parameters.\n\n>  Because many Bitcoin market participants would well be ready to pay 2 cents TX fee, but if they can get the same service for 0.5 cent, they will not pay 2 cent voluntarily. So we need a rule structure to get back to the 2 cent point (but not to the $2 point though! - this would drive users away to competing systems and not benefit the Bitcoin eco-system!).\n\nI don't get the logic here, why you want to go to 2 cents, but not to 0.5 cent? I think differently here. Also how do you decide that 2 cents is ok, and $2 is too big? I don't care if the fee becomes $15. But only if this increase happens due to market natural conditions, e.g. huge adoption, technology is not enough to cover growth speed, miners can't propagate bigger blocks, they just increase minimum fees they want transactions to have. If it grows to $15 because of this - then ok, there will be less people using the system, transactions number decrease, fees decrease. This is market, it will self-regulate. Technology will improve, and the same transaction volume will be less costly to mine - then fees for customers decrease, new customers jump on board.\n\nSame in the scenario of short-term vs. long-term goals.

Why?\n\nFirst of all - there might be not enough transactions in the mempool for this. Second, max limit can be bigger than average blocks produced and this could be an equilibrium.\n\nAs you say if miners want to vote for current block size limit of 1Mb the majority of miners just continue mining of 1Mb blocks (no need to reduce it to 50%), limit will be increased to 2Mb in a while based on median of 1Mb, but miners still continue mine 1Mb blocks and market will be stable.\n\nActually as I mentioned in another comment - there are forces moving block size into different sides.\n\nOrphan rate will push miners to decrease block size. According to [Peter Rizun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ad0Pjj_ms2k) current orphan rate is 1% of all blocks and this can increase with increased block size. Also this increase will probably be not linear to block size.\n\nJonathan Toomim did [some analysis on testnet](https://youtu.be/ivgxcEOyWNs?t=8729) and it shows that at 8Mb per block Chinese miners will have long propagation times due to Chinese firewall, that means orphan rates can increase a lot motivating them to mine smaller blocks.\n\nIf the increase from 1Mb to 8Mb block will increase orphan rate from 1% to say 10%, that means 9%*25 BTC (current reward) is 2.25 BTC loss on every mined block on average. Currently transaction fees bring smaller amount to miners than this, so for them it makes sense to ignore fees and rely on reward solely, means to reduce block size and decrease orphan rates.\n\n10% orphan rate is something I just made up and it could be different, but generally the logic works and market will be self-regulating.\n\nSo the technology will evolve, which will allow to propagate blocks faster, then orphan rate will decrease at same block sizes and then miners will be incentivized to increase block size, because now their marginal gain will be more than marginal loss. You know it is kind of basic microeconomics 101 course when they compare marginal cost of production and marginal profits in order to find an optimal production point for manufacturer, but very same logic perfectly applies to block size self-regulation.": 2, 'I see, so acc. to that logic you say it is not allowed to reject a block because it is too big.\n\nI.e. if my own limit is 3 MB (if I am a miner), but a new foreign block arrives with 100 MB, I HAVE to validate it and mine on top of it (because all other miners also will mine on it, so I have to do so, too)?\n\nJust a question for understanding.\n\nMy assumption was that miners in BU use-case would set a limit for this as well (if not in reference implementation of BU, then in BU forks run by miners practically), i.e. a foreign block larger than XX MB will be ignored because considered spam. And then the question is, what is "XX", and then the miner operators have to talk to each other as I outlined.\n\nSo I was taking different assumptions than you, this is clarified now, ok.\n\nAssuming your model of BU, I see another problem with BU:\n\nThe "tragedy of the commons" is a problematic threat for BU, that will manifest more and more as TX fees take over block rewards. Miners will more and more drift to greater blocks, to collect the TX fees, in an effort to maximize short-term profits for the current block. So block sizes will increase more and more and TX fee revenues will diminish, because the miners destroy their own base of income by their short-term egositic economical optimization behaviour, which is normal. It\'s like in real life, nobody start with environmental protection first, it gives each of the individual small players a disadvantage, but if everybody is forced to so it by law, everybody wins.\n\nDon\'t get me wrong, I am far from being a "small blocker" (just my last post in my history I had with luke-jr drove me crazy, you can look at my posting history), but BU as you describe it goes too far for me, because it will be driven only by egoistic short-term thoughts of the miners, and this even more so, the more the mining landscape is fragmented without dominating mining pool (which is what we all desire and have to design Bitcoin for). This is unhealthy, to say the least, for the  eco-system. Miners are able to influence the evolution of Bitcoin in two ways: optimize short term profit (current self-mined block), and optimize long-term strategy. Like in real life (life quality, environmental protection, organization of societies), also for Bitcoin these optimization targets are not going in the same direction, i.e. you have to build an eco-system framework that enables miners to optimize for both. The only way to avoid this destructive evolution with BU is when miners sit together and discuss actual block size limits that they commonly agree upon, as I was assuming above.\n\nIf you do not know what I am talking about here, read [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3zvs8f/a_simple_adaptive_block_size_limit/cyr7aoj) (and the corresponding part 2 of it). There I describe why also bitpay\'s current proposal suffers this problem of the tragedy of commons, but it can be fixed with a simple amendment to bitpay\'s proposal.': 1, '> I think you (and also Peter__R by the way) have not appreciated enough the inherent conflict between the different (!) short-term and long-term economical optimization functions, both of which are economical realities that need to be taken into account for a complete economical modelling of the system.\n\nI think we are (at least I am), my core argument that there will be no that many transactions to fill the block size fully (I wrote about in my previous response and you have not addressed it). So basically whatever short-term maximization goal they have - they won\'t be able to increase it forever, it will go in hand with the economic activity. And this is in general I find good long term because the system scales with how much it is used.\n\nJust couple remarks on your rest part (although as you mentioned it kind of becomes not relevant).\n\n> But would miners be similarly smart? I very much doubt it\n\nWhy do you think they are not? I do believe in miners\' smartness and market forces in general.\n\n> It is not complex.\n> The mentioned "excess fees" of block N (if block N\'s size is > BSL/2) go to the miner of block N +/- delta, where delta is a function of block N\'s hash, acc. to a pre-defined function.\n\nFor me this is very complex, sorry :) It has to be very simple and clear in my opinion, KISS is the rule.': 1}, ('I wrote a paper on Bitcoin for a finance class that I think is pretty cool: Estimating the Beta of Bitcoin.

For an even cooler example let's assume X and Y both have an expected return of 2% and risk of 10%. The cool part is that risk (aka volatility aka standard deviation) isn't strictly additive. If X and Y both have a volatility of 10%, the overall risk of the portfolio will be less than 10% as long as X and Y aren't perfectly correlated.

Some people can't agree on it's classification: currency, commodity, something new? Beta is a finance thing that measures the risk of an asset versus a portfolio, it seeks to find out how much risk is common to both and how much is idiosyncratic.\n\nBeta is usually calculated against market indexes, so I did that. Here we are expecting a low beta, maybe even a negative beta.\n\nThen I calculated it against gold, a currency index, and a commodity index. The reason for this is to look to see if bitcoin shares risk with these categories of assets. A beta of close to 1 against these assets would indicate that bitcoin shares a large amount of common risk with these categories, perhaps meaning that bitcoin could be considered part of that category. \n\nThe results against market indexes were as expected, bitcoin does not seem to share significant risk with the market index, thus it looks like bitcoin can be used to further diversify an investor. \n\nThe results against the other portfolios seem to suggest that bitcoin does not share significant risk with any existing categories, so perhaps this lends credence to the theory that bitcoin is a new type of asset.

George Jetson, for example, worked 3-4 hours a day because that's all he was required to do, and then he jetted (pun intended) home to spend time with his family.

Creative enterprises, from the production of entertainment to the design of buildings, remains something intuitive that is very hard to teach an artificial intelligence. \n\nFurthermore, I don't think humans, at this point, are benevolent enough to really have a society in which everyone gets a minimum income, or even one in which workers displaced by robots get compensated for that. Detroit autoworkers weren't compensated when NAFTA shipped their manufacturing jobs to Japan and Mexico. \n\nAnyway, I don't think utopia is around the corner, as much as I'd like it to be.

The chance of politicizing GMI - a politician promising to raise it by 5k as part of an election pledge, for example - is all but guaranteed in a democracy. The problem of immigration must be fixed as well, because obviously no country can take in everyone and pay them all the GMI.\n\nMost of what I've seen for GMI doesn't make it comfortable - ie, not $30k - but more like poverty-level. Something like 12-15k a person, in the US. It's enough money that they can pay rent and have food to eat, but not enough money that they'll be watching high-definition television while eating bacon and drinking craft beer. And yeah, inflation would eat into that amount over time.\n\nPractically and politically, GMI is completely unrealistic. You'd need it to be rolled out globally at the same time, because otherwise a large number of your high earners (which are the ones doing the paying) would just leave after their taxes get hiked. Furthermore, it is guaranteed that, like socialism, a country which adopts GMI while the rest of the world doesn't would fall behind economically, eventually making it vulnerable to military attacks while drawing away its most material-minded / ambitious. You'd also need to think about indexing the GMI to local conditions - 15k in NYC buys a lot less than 15k in rural Wyorming. And that reeks of 'unfair' in the minds of most people unversed in economics.\n\nThat said, the flat tax ideas which seem to surface from time to time include some form of a GMI, they just don't call it that. Almost every flat tax includes a guaranteed tax rebate equivalent to the poverty level which everyone qualifies for.

Thomas Friedman wrote a few years ago how the internet would flatten the world- and it has to an extent with sharing content, but there was still a lot of friction for business because of the limits of the old finance and commerce model limitations.  Bitcoin and Openbazaar are quickly changing that.  No matter what it is worth it to me to try out and build otherwise we are telling the rest of the world that they have to wait until a JPM bank branch is built in their village and for them to be vetted by them before they can start a business and make a living with access to the whole world and not just their local economy.
