Don't accept any statistics from them as they don't have the data by definition.\n\nMy problem with this business model is the following two points. Lets assume the person buying the goods for you is a carder. (You can argue over the percentages of carders on the site, but lets assume its non-zero)\n\n1. Amazon has no idea the transaction is originating from the service and so can't factor this into it's fraud detection algorithm. There is also no way for the service to get feedback from amazon regarding which purchases were done by carders and which weren't. By definition the service cannot provide statistics on fraud. For all you know Amazon and the CC companies are eating it, and you and the recipient of the goods are non the wiser.\n\n2. And most importantly, the person receiving the goods is solving major problems for the carder. The problems are:\n\n*An address to send the stolen goods to\n\n*A liquid market to receive cash for stolen goods.\n\nThe person receiving the goods has no idea how many times her address has been used for fraud, and has no way of knowing at what point it might trigger an investigation or police knocking on her door. (as I believe has already happened with purse.io)\n\nNow I know the usual comeback is to pull out some statistics about the sites only having a 0.2% fraud rate, but as I pointed out in point 1, all that risk is allocated to Amazon, so you have very little data on it.\n\nThere is no way I could ever recommend any of these services to people, or use it myself. Imagine you recommend it to your wife's friend and then her door gets kicked in by the cops because over the past year her address has been used by carders on 4 different occasions out of 50 or something.

No one in set 4 gets a key (almost everyone on Earth would be in set 4). Two keys from someone in set 1 and/or 2 can do one unlock (Red envelope). And two other keys from set 2 and/or 3 could do another unlock (Blue envelope).

Once unlocked, the contents of the Red and Blue envelopes could ultimately be the same.

Unfortunately they wouldn't help in this case because of the [t' = 2*t - 1](https://freedom-to-tinker.com/blog/stevenag/threshold-signatures-and-bitcoin-wallet-security-a-menu-of-options/) required (for ECDSA-compatible threshold signatures anyway) participants to create a signature where t is the number of participants that could derive the private key if they colluded together. So the natural idea would be to give party 1 (aka party A) 999 shares and only give 1 share each to the remaining 999 parties, then require a 1000-of-1998 threshold signature scheme. Unfortunately this won't work since t = 1000, so t' = 2*t - 1 = 1999 which is not less than or equal to n = 1998. But even if n was 1999 (for example add a party 1001 with a single share which would mean parties 2 to 1001 could collude together to get the private key without participation from party 1), it still wouldn't be a good solution because it would require all 1001 parties to work together to generate the signature.\n\nThat annoying limitation wouldn't exist if Bitcoin used [Schnorr signatures](http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/2jw5pm/im_gavin_andresen_chief_scientist_at_the_bitcoin/clfp3xj). Unfortunately, we are stuck with ECDSA. So the best way for the OP to implement what he wants given the current limitations of Bitcoin (ECDSA, checkmultisig limits, limits on script size, etc.) is to just do what /u/saintoshi said: create a 2-of-2 multisig where one of the private keys is held by party 1 (the master key) and the other private key is shared among parties 2 to 1000.

This attacker would likely be committing a crime (when double spending to defraud).  Acquiring $100M of top-end hashing hardware is not something done without the manufacturer knowing who the buyer is.  And there are few places you can trade without KYC so even if the exchanges somehow were to release to the attacker the funds before being double spent upon, they would have recourse.\n\nIf this attacker just wants to acquire 51% and not commit fraud (i.e, would not double spend for the purpose of defrauding) but censor some or all transactions and rejecting all blocks by any other miners then that would be damaging but perhaps not fatal as countermeasures are available and it then probably becomes a game of whack-a-mole, the protocol changing to make attacking more difficult and the attacker responding.

Maybe halving occurs and we end up with only 1,500,000 Th/s (all other things being equal, such as no improvement in ASICs), does that mean that a 51% becomes more of a threat?   \n\nWe likely have mining protection on our blockchain vault the equivalent of six foot thick steel walls where maybe only eight inches are needed.

Much of the current value of Bitcoin is counting on Bitcoin gaining traction and the amount paid in transaction fees rises -- offsetting the amount the current block reward subsidy when that drops.\n\nAlso you might not be appreciating what a 51% attack entails.\n\nThe current hashrate is 303,059 Th/s per http://bitcoinwatch.com   It isn't varying much, even with a much lower exhange rate: http://bitcoin.sipa.be/speed-lin.png\n\nSo to amass 51% to enable you to mine a private fork of the blockchain with the intention of double spending of confirmed transactions, then you would need 303,059 Th/s of your own.  \n\nAn $1,150 Antminer S4 does 2 Th/s.  So you would need at leas 151,529 of them (a $175M investment) to get 51% of the network.   Got your checkbook ready?\n\nSo it doesn't matter what the exchange rate is, it matters what the hashrate is.  Sure, the hashrate will generally follow the the block reward subsidy (exchange rate X bitcoins issued per block), but even if the next halving were tomorrow and the level of mining drops by half (which it won't), that 51% still takes an investment of $100M of hardware.\n\nEven if you had made that investment and truly have 51%, there's no guarantee you will succeed at duping exchanges and e-wallets into giving you $100M of value before you unleash your private fork. \n\nSo a $100M investment with the opportunity to get only a fraction of that back in successful double spending is neither a wise nor worthwhile endeavor.": 4}, ("How to interpret Blockchain.info's Orphaned Blocks page?", 1): {'> I\'m especially unsure of the difference between a single solid arrow and a split solid arrow.\n\nI noticed that going from the top, it\'s all single arrows until it reaches a threshold of about 500 blocks into the past, and then it\'s all split arrows.

Lets assume the person buying the goods for you is a carder. (You can argue over the percentages of carders on the site, but lets assume its non-zero)\n\n1. Amazon has no idea the transaction is originating from the service and so can't factor this into it's fraud detection algorithm. There is also no way for the service to get feedback from amazon regarding which purchases were done by carders and which weren't. By definition the service cannot provide statistics on fraud. For all you know Amazon and the CC companies are eating it, and you and the recipient of the goods are non the wiser.\n\n2. And most importantly, the person receiving the goods is solving major problems for the carder. The problems are:\n\n*An address to send the stolen goods to\n\n*A liquid market to receive cash for stolen goods.\n\n\nThe person receiving the goods has no idea how many times her address has been used for fraud, and has no way of knowing at what point it might trigger an investigation or police knocking on her door. (as I believe has already happened with purse.io)\n\nNow I know the usual comeback is to pull out some statistics about the sites only having a 0.2% fraud rate, but as I pointed out in point \n\n1, all that risk is allocated to Amazon, so you have very little data on it.\n\nThere is no way I could ever recommend any of these services to people, or use it myself. Imagine you recommend it to your wife's friend and then her door gets kicked in by the cops because over the past year her address has been used by carders on 4 different occasions out of 50 or something. (the carder also gets to see your name and city I believe)\n\nThis is a cute little game on the system, but ultimately you profit from allocating risk to Amazon / CC companies and legal risk to your customers, with at least the second one being immoral in my opinion unless the risks are correctly laid out (and you don't have the data to do this)": 1, 'I made 3 purchases there.
