It\'ll have uses, but it will be nowhere near as "monetized" without meaningful touchpoints into everyday economic activity. \n\nThere may be some middle ground; eg, if there are *enough* merchants/services worldwide who accept bitcoin that it\'s therefore valid for savers to consider it a store of value since they can always directly use it without going through the existing financial system at all, if they need to. **That right there is the essence of real censorship-resistance.**\n\nSo it should be clear from that that *more* direct use, more merchant acceptance, is a good thing and something the community should still seek.

Second, and more importantly, consider all of your investments including Bitcoin and savings. How much do you have in total? If you have $1m, sit on your btc and enjoy the ride. If you have significantly less and no other investments, you should definitely diversify. BTC is definitely a high risk asset and should make up a fairly small portion of anyone's overall investments. \n\nPersonally I am extremely bullish on bitcoin, and have a reckless ~30% in crypto. I Would recommend for anyone to have some portion of their portfolio in a wide variety of assets, don't put your nest egg entirely in a great investment like bitcoin. Buy some Vanguard index fund shares, US government bonds and some emerging markets stocks (I particularly like Asia and the Middle East).  Buy some gold and silver (I like ~10%). \n\nDiversify, it actually is really important. The upside of having a larger share of a risky investment is dwarfed by the risk.

We also have the largest military force that ever existed so I\'m sure that doesn\'t hurt.  It would seem though that at some point quadrupling the money base "could" come back to haunt the USD.  \n\nI also theorize that we actually have massive real inflation.  Real inflation is supposedly decoupled from monetary base inflation.  Some suggest they are not even related but that\'s hard to imagine.  I think perhaps they are decoupled only by the time it takes for the effects of the base expansion to turn into "real" inflation.  The 2nd part of my theory is that we are not seeing and feeling the real inflation since we also have a massive deflationary force which is caused by technological advancements and their associated productivity improvements.  Tech is now invading many more areas of life bringing with it Moore\'s law.  Medical equipment, manufacturing equipment etc. are all improving, in theory at a more similar rate to Moore\'s law.  Think about how much clothes cost now.  They are cheaper now even before adjusting for reported inflation.\n\nThe question that this all brings up to me is what would the landscape look like if we didn\'t have these crazy financial policies yet did have the technological progress, or even worse, what would things look like if it were the other way around?  Some would argue that "free money" helped drive tech.  There is likely some truth to this but at the same time that didn\'t really start in the US until the decoupling of the dollar from gold, and before that the introduction of fiat and the federal reserve.  Historical charts show that technology has been following a relatively smooth exponential curve since the begging of civilization independent of these monetary changes.\n\nI see it as the politicians and people with influence over them milking the fruits of technological progress.  People don\'t notice a few percentage points per year, like a boiling frog, but at some point it means the difference between a $100,000 average home price and $300,000 average home price and your cooked.\n\nIt\'s hard to time the markets but to me it feels like the perfect storm is converging and the money masters have run out of tricks.  Yellen just punted on the meager interest rate increase, one of her last possible "illusions".  That can\'t mean anything good.  Unlike when a 3rd world currency collapses, the USD is the de facto world currency if there ever has been one.  Most oil is traded in it for example.

Expensive models may be significantly more valuable than the fabric they are made of. Jewelry can be significantly more valuable than the gold it is made of. Postal stamps are significantly more valuable than the paper they are made of. Live camels are more valuable than their meat.\n\nNote that for valuable software or songs there is no material you can say they are "made of".\n\nSumming up, your definition can only be used for coins made of a precious metal, and you are out of luck trying to apply it to other cases.': 1, 'Schr\xc3\xb6dingerCoin?': 2, '[spot on](https://i.imgur.com/himZD0M.gif)': 8, 'The halving will *not* cause an increase in value though.': -3, "Haven't you heard, we're exceptional in just about every way.

I am only talking about the specific case of money. If a money is literally made out of a commodity, then its value can never go below the value of the underlying commodity itself. Now, if the commodity\'s value drops to zero, then the money can also become worthless. \n\nIn bitcoin\'s case, right now the underlying commodity -- the bitcoin blockchain -- doesn\'t have much value, so bitcoin doesn\'t have any "intrinsic" value either. However, if the blockchain were to be used for things beyond money -- for smart contracts, 2.0 currencies, other financial instruments, etc -- then as the blockchain became more valuable, at the minimum bitcoin would be worth its value as a unit to provide access to blockchain use. \n\nEven if people don\'t use bitcoin as money, if the blockchain ends up being the backbone of the global financial system, for example, people will need bitcoin to use the blockchain. Consequently, there will be demand for bitcoin even if it isn\'t used as money. This is exactly how gold money works, there is a demand for it even if it isn\'t used as money. That is the real definition of "intrinsic value" when we are talking about money. \n\nSo many people who criticize bitcoin for not having intrinsic value don\'t understand that if bitcoin is successful it will end up acquiring intrinsic value because of the nature of the technology and the fact that the blockchain has potential uses far beyond money.

Everyone expects bitcoin to be more scarce as the creation of new bitcoin is constricted.\n\nalso, look at the options market. options merely 6 months out are so inefficiently priced, as despite how many pundits say "its priced in" based on the information available now, anything can happen, so prices are reflective of past volatility instead of future events': 1, "We've known that there would only be, at most, 21 million bitcoins for years.

You do not know speculators aren\'t already buying, so a significant rise might be happening before the halving, just like you said. But who knows when exactly?

There\'s a lot of uncertainty pressing down on price, if everyone knew Bitcoin would still exist next year (or in ten years for that matter) prices would probably be higher. \n\nIn your efficient market every participant is 100% informed, yet I wager in reality there are lots of people holding Bitcoin not knowing about the halving, or what it really does. The more people get informed, the closer we get to our true price (be that above or below current price).\n\nIf you imagine the demand of Bitcoin as a constant stream of X BTC/h you will realize how the halving has to influence price at some point in time. The whole ecosystem will effectively have a tightened supply of Bitcoin to go around, so for price to stay the same we either need more holders to sell each day (why should they suddenly decide to sell?), less buyers/ reduced interest in Bitcoin, or higher velocity of money (read BTC) - the combination of these factors will determine daily price.': 2, 'I think the idea of "intrinsic value" is really that the commodity used as currency will still retain value even if it isn\'t considered money anymore. It provides a floor, as it were, beneath which its value cannot fall. \n\nIt is interesting that bitcoin is being called a \'commodity,\' because there is a tacit recognition there that bitcoin might actually possess intrinsic value. I don\'t think it is coincidence that this is happening around the time where there is so much buzz around blockchains as the future of finance. \n\nIn essence, a successful blockchain will, in effect, become the foundation for entire financial systems, making the units of that blockchain intrinsically valuable. If bitcoin\'s blockchain were to become hugely successful -- largely due to characteristics inherent to public, open ledgers that can\'t be replicated by permissioned blockchains -- then even if bitcoin is never actually used as a currency in day to day affairs, its price would have a floor value exactly the same way we expect of other commodity based currencies like gold. \n\nSo essentially bitcoin\'s "intrinsic value" is forward looking rather than backward looking the way it is with gold, for instance, and the irony might be that -- whereas gold\'s intrinsic value was what led it to eventually become money -- bitcoin\'s initial use as money might be what leads it to eventually possess intrinsic value even if it ceases to function as money. ': 4, 'I suppose one day even food will have a value of zero. Let\'s not get ridiculous here. The point is that if a pure fiat money -- assuming there is such a thing -- ceases to function as money then its value goes to zero since it\'s value was 100% dependent on its role as money. Remove that role and it ceases to have value. \n\nA commodity based money, on the other hand, derives its value not simply in its function as money, but also from its value as a commodity. So if gold, for instance, is used as money and then suddenly people stop using it as money it will still retain value because people use gold for other things than money. It is a simple point really. This isn\'t to say that one day people will stop using gold entirely and the value will go to zero. The point is simply that its commodity status provides a floor for value loss should the commodity cease to function as money. \n\nMany people criticize bitcoin for not having intrinsic value, they accuse it of essentially being a fiat currency. But should the blockchain be used for all sorts of things beyond currency -- if smart contracts, stocks, and identity systems, etc, are all built eventually on top of the blockchain -- then even if bitcoin ceases to function as money it will retain its value, and that is precisely what is meant by "intrinsic value" (not some overblown philosophical notion that things will have value forever independent of human beings).

Considering the world at large, it is essentially and unknown event.\n\nI think the current price situation is reflective of a largely-static market view of risks and possible gains.

To beg a question is to advocate an issue.': 1, '>For centuries, minted coins not only represented the value and trust of banks, their depositors and eventually nation-states, but also were deemed valuable because they were made from precious metals like gold and silver. These metals are difficult to move around in large quantities, and so banknotes were invented as early as the seventh century in China and brought to Europe in the 13th century. Unlike coins, banknotes were not treated as valuable in themselves since they were simply printed on otherwise worthless paper. Rather, they served as a form of promissory note or IOU that could be presented to the banks that issued them in exchange for their face value in precious metal, coins or bullion.\n\nThe irony of this "academic" article is that it implicitly premises its conclusions on the fact that money had intrinsic value when it was backed by precious metals.  Yet it does not understand that even the value associated to precious metals is somewhat "metaphysical."\n\nThe article presupposes that precious metals are intrinsically valuable.  But a true academic article should understand the elemental nature of the value behind precious metals.\n\nPrecious metals only have value for two reasons.  They are scarce, and they have utility.  The primary value driving utility though is not in their usages as metals, but in their utility as a currency.  The factors that determine utility as a currency include fungibility, divisibility, scarcity, indestructibility, portability, transferability, and others.  When these factors exist all that is required is adoption.\n\nBitcoin needs a little work in transferability, but apart from that and assuming internet connectivity, bitcoin does money better than any other currency to ever exist.  It simply needs wide adoption and a means of mass transactions.  However, even without mass transactions, it is still relatively good at transferability and makes a great store of value.': 2}, ('Shower thought: Recurring subscriptions paid with bitcoin might work like this', 24): {"I haven't tried, but I am nearly certain it does work... provided you do so before the time expires.": 1, "Oh cool, now not only can they not automate it by taking the money, now I'm gonna have to write a whole dumb schedule script if I want to automate it on my side.

That's ridiculous. It would probably mean that their monthly is way too costly. Tbh, the amount a business ought to discount for paying up front instead of at the end of the year, is probably a fairly simple NPV calculation that would include some percentage of customers that won't buy unless the option exists, some percentage of customers that won't buy because the option exists, and some percentage of customers that would have paid the regular fee and instead take the discount. If you don't know these numbers, you're going to apply random discounts as you just did here.\n\nThe truth is, subscription businesses are hard. They suffer from high attrition rates, and those are hard to control. Insurance, I believe, has something like a 40% attrition rate year over year.

As your percentage grows, it becomes more difficult to increase it further.\n\nFor example, if the network is at 1,000 hashes/second, and adding hardware will cost you $1/hash/second... You could own 33% of the network for $500 (increased network now being 1,500 hashes/second). For another $500, you could own 50%. Multiplying your costs by 2 with that second $500 only multiplies your gross revenue (33% to 50%) by about 1.52.': 7, 'The deals today are just unreal!': 4, 'The good old days.': 2, '...and it says Mr.Investor we are putting $100 million behind our faith in bitcoin so have so balls and take the plunge with us... and I most surely will! lol GL\n\n': 1, 'All that they need to do in order for that to happen is mine a lot of the blocks themselves and not dump them on the market constantly like most of the Chinese miners have been doing.': 3, 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(country)': 2, 'The current price means very little for a long-term construction project.
