It\'s not of any particular concern for us in Bitcoin*.\n\nThe author\'s [prior work from 2004](https://eprint.iacr.org/2004/031.pdf) about summation polynomials is generic, but doesn\'t seem to yield an improvement.  You get a system of equations which is not solvable,  but for the characteristic 2 curves you get something which may be solvable via grobner basis.\n\nThe basis idea is that you want to find the discrete log (z) of Q with respect to P,  so Q = zP.\n\n(e.g. if P is the group generator, then z is a private key and Q the public key).\n\nGuess two random values, u and v and compute  uQ + vP  and if the result is infinity (the additive identity in the EC group, analogous to a \'0\' in the integers),  it means that z is just one of the solutions to u*z + v === 0 mod order, and you can just solve for it directly. You\'re done.\n\nYou\'re not likely to get so lucky with your u and v choices.\n\nSo instead the paper gives a procedure for finding collections of points (X) where X1 + X2 + X3 ... + uQ + vP == Inf; over some fixed somewhat large set of candidate Xs. You then setup a system of linear equations-- multiplying each of the relations by some unknown and then summing them together to get another zero, while also ensuring that the some of each of the used Xs cancel as well-- to let you cancel out all the other parts, and eventually giving yourself a result uQ + vP == Inf that actually works.  For large prime fields (like is used in Bitcoin) this appears to be intractable but they give an approach for binary extension fields that makes it look a lot like the solver you need for the general number field sieve used for factoring RSA numbers; and apparently for these groups he gets projected performance numbers that are \'faster\' than pollard rho. Though \'faster\' is also somewhat limited, e.g. taking the 571 bit curve down to something more like the rho security of the 350 bit curves, and no improvements for the curves under 310 bits or so. \n\nHowever, even there these speedups require storing huge numbers of these candidate relations, and the storage looks quite considerable, so even in the places where it applies it may not be /engineering/ practical.\n\n[*Though, actually there is some cryptographically confused altcoin whos name I cannot recall that adopted a characteristic 2 curve because they wanted a cryptosystem which "didn\'t involve any primes" (totally ignoring that the 571 in their 2^571 curve is prime, and that if it weren\'t prime the curve would be highly vulnerable to weil descent); this might actually break them; but it was obviously a poor decision, which I\'d called out as such, prior to this paper]\n': 13, 'Bitcoin user not affected.\n\nIn other news, a particular bike lock has been found vulnerable to a particular lock picking technique.\n': 1}, ('Fascinating use cases for Bitcoin.', 0): {'So, what is the magic?

What it checks is that the set of public key {xpubTREZOR, xpubGA} is the same for spent outputs and change address.

Nevertheless the attack from GA you mentioned is now possible.      \n       \n**Future state:**       \nBase on your feedback, we will make following changes to firmware in near future.        \n1) "Eye" function will not only display the address on TREZOR, but it will also display the type of the m-of-n multisig. So you can check when sending new funds to GA that you are actually sending it to 2-of-2 multisig type.         \n2) TREZOR will for the exact type of multisig, so GA won\'t be able to do switch from 2-of-2 to 1-of-2 secretly.

I had the choice to go on with the charade while they were still milking money from their members. Your argument is that the members should have know? How? The fact that everyone is up in arms right now is because it was not news that they were almost broke? Right. You would have preferred me to just sit back and play along and continue the non-transparency? Make no mistake, it was not going to happen, no matter what they were saying. There was always an excuse, Jim and myself tried to get transparency and I asked the board to take responsibility for their actions, but I got threatened in return (with a deadline I might add), so yes, I went public.\n- I never said Mark Karpeles tried to get someone killed. I said Mark Karpeles made a dead threat to an ex-employee. I have a copy of the actual death threat evidence which was filed with the Japanese police. I know it was filed because the ex employee that filed it used my lawyer. After I posted that information, someone sent me the original email and the headers turned out to be possibly false. I had the honor to correct that. I did not publish anything a news agency wouldn\'t have published. The better question to ask would be who was not telling the truth?\n- Yeah, I said I would resign, I\'m not the one who started the Brock comment, I was just one of the guys that followed in line. So don\'t put that one on me. I did not end up resigning, cause in the end I realised that would restrict me from being able to speak my mind on the Foundation forum, which is members-only.\n- Yes, I offered $100k of my personal savings to help fund a decentralized crowdfunding platform. Are you actually saying that\'s a bad thing? And the reason it was delayed was not my fault, Mike took longer than expected, maybe if more people would have helped test him it would have gone quicker.

I refused to do so cause I did not want to damage Mtgox and the community. If I would have only cared about myself that day, I would have been 5 million dollars richer.\n- I paid over 100k in legal fees to keep those who lost out on mtgox adviced on what the options were. \n- I invested over $2 million dollars in various Bitcoin startups.\n\nI\'m definitely the bad guy here..

You say the foundation has been pretty upfront about their financial challenges, but the response to Olivier's original post shows that the word hadn't really gotten out.\n\nThe bombshell for me is that the Bitcoin Foundation got addicted to gambling on the price of Bitcoin. For a while they had deep pockets, but when the trend flipped, they lost pretty much everything.\n\nIn comparison there are hundreds of Bitcoin startups now and I would bet that very few of them hold all their assets in Bitcoin.

As with other bitcoin companies that hold bitcoin, the drop in bitcoin price drastically affected the Foundation\xe2\x80\x99s bottom line as the majority of assets were held in bitcoin.\'\n\nI said it is as good as bankrupt and has almost no money left. I never claimed they filed for bankruptcy. There have been discussions on it being insolvent (or a potential bankruptcy), Patrick even mentions it in his proposal: "To continue funding an engineering team within the Foundation we will need a significant infusion of cash or potentially be insolvent in ~8 weeks" (That was over a month ago).\n\n- \'In the last board meeting, the management team presented an austere, yet clear, path forward for the board. The board of directors voted on March 31, 2015 to proceed with the strategic plan and to work out a communications plan to roll out the decision along with the finished annual report for members and the public. That strategic plan proposed by the management team was to be rolled out this week.\'\n\nThis is a lie. We only voted on firing staff. No plan was approved. The board minutes will back that up. To quote Patrick "The only thing that we\xe2\x80\x99re voting on in this vote is to reduce cost by cutting headcount.".\n\n- \'The Foundation also did not fire 90% of its people. The Foundation holds the majority of its assets in bitcoin so when the price of bitcoin dropped last year to under $400 and then held steady in the $200 range, tough decisions were made to trim down programs and instead, focus on funding developers working on the Bitcoin Core Protocol. This meant downsizing our team as the Foundation could not continue supporting the full team. Some team members left voluntarily and agreed to continue helping on a volunteer basis to help the Foundation during this financially austere time.\'\n\nSo it\'s not 90%, is it 80%? The point was that most of the staff was fired, and yes some were kept as volunteers as I mentioned.\n\nI see a pattern of blaming everything on the falling Bitcoin price.

Re-installing the wallet and restoring it from backup helped resolve the issue.

Additional testing did not show if there is a bug in the application that could have lead to the lock out of funds. We also could not reproduce the issue where updating from v1.0 to v1.1 makes payments impossible on any of our own systems.\n\nWe began collecting reports from customers with various details of their iPhone setup, and reached out to several customers to perform additional diagnostics on their devices. While investigating the issue, we learned that several other iOS developers reported a similar intermittent issue with a security component known as "Keychain": the operating system simply locks the application out of the secret data being stored by it. We could not yet find a concrete explanation on how that\'s possible and what is the best workaround for it (e.g.https://devforums.apple.com/thread/246122?start=0&tstart=0).\n\nThe investigation is ongoing, but in the meanwhile we have implemented mitigation methods to reduce the impact of the issue. We are still testing it and very soon will resubmit the app to the App Store.\nNext steps\n\n    If you have a previous verson (1.0) installed, please make sure you have made a back up. It can be done in Settings tab -> Export Wallet Master Key. You will be shown a list of words: write them down and re-enter to make sure you did not make a mistake.\n\n    If you have the latest version (1.1) installed and it works fine for you, still make sure you have a backup as described above.\n\n    If you cannot send money and you have made a backup, please make sure your back up is still accessible. When the update comes out, you will be able to simply re-install the app, enter your backup words, and use it normally.\n\n    If you have not made a backup, but have not deposited any funds into your wallet, you may simply re-install and create a new wallet when the update comes out (do not send any coins to your wallet in the meantime).\n\n    If you cannot send money and you have not saved the backup, we will have a manual diagnostic process to help you. Please contact us (see the details below). Do not delete the Mycelium Wallet and do not deposit more bitcoins into it\n\nThe updated app will take several days or even a week to appear after the problem is identified and solved due to the App Store validation process.\n\nIf you have made a backup and you need to access your funds sooner, you may use the Android Mycelium Wallet and restore your backup there.\nManual diagnostic process\n\nWe ask every customer who can\'t access their coins and who has not made a backup to contact us by email at ios@mycelium.com. The process is tedious, so if you have a backup, please wait for the update to come out, or use the Android Mycelium Wallet to access the funds from your backup.\n\nIf you do not have the backup, please send us an email with the following information:\n\n    Your device identifier (UDID, see below on how to find it).\n    Your contact email.\n\nNote 1: Do not delete the existing installation of your wallet! If you do, you will irrevocably lose all the information that may help with recovering your funds.\n\nNote 2: We do not want, nor need your personal identifying information. If you have privacy concerns, please use a temporary email address and Tor if needed. Just make sure the email address you provide will work for a few days so we can contact you back.\n\nNote 3: Your device identifier is only necessary for us to be able to make a diagnostic build of the app for your device. Apple\'s app signing process requires that. Since 2013, no application (including Mycelium) has access to that identifier, so it\'s not possible to use it to track any of your activity on your iPhone. It\'s only good for installing builds during development outside the AppStore. See below for more information. If you are still concerned about privacy implications, you may wait for an AppStore-based build to come out and use that for diagnostic process.\n\nWe will send you back a diagnostic build of Mycelium Wallet and further instructions.\n\nThankfully not many people are affected, and we will work as fast as we can, but this could still take a few days to resolve. We will try to be very careful in order to successfully recover your funds. We hope you understand.\nHow to find your device identifier (UDID)\n\n    Connect your iPhone to a Mac or PC with iTunes.\n    Select your iPhone in iTunes. You may need to unlock it first (enter passcode or TouchID).\n    Open the Summary tab for that iPhone (the very first one).\n    Click the label "Serial Number: X7TG14Y1ESK7" until it starts showing "UDID: d87437b0310078e50ced34739b3b54f89b69ac07" (your numbers will be different). The label does not look like a button, but it\'s clickable.\n    Right-click the UDID and copy it.\n    Include that UDID in the email to us.\n\nFor more information about UDID, please see:\n\n    https://www.innerfence.com/howto/find-iphone-unique-device-identifier-udid\n    https://theiphonewiki.com/wiki/UDID\n\n': 1, 'Idk never touched an Apple in my life': 2}, ('Tipping / Giving Tuesdays - First 1000 comments get free bitcoin - Next week we will be doing a food drive for the homeless & under privileged in Barbados all paid for in Bitcoin.', 87): {'Thanks for keeping this Tipping Tuesday running!!!': 5, '/u/changetip 100 bits': 3, ':D /u/changetip 100 bits': 3, 'Please give double (theirs+ whatever you planned to give me) to the first poster who replies to my post! :)': 2, 'The Bitcoin tip for 100 bits has been collected by *kcbitcoin*.\n\n\n--\n\n[^^what ^^is ^^ChangeTip?](https://www.reddit.com/r/changetip/wiki/tipping-on-reddit)': 1, 'Thanks analyzer for awrsome work!

Any bitcoin sent, (an underpayment, or an overpayment sent to that address), well, it\'s a valid bitcoin address and it\'s going to be sent, and BitPay is going to receive that bitcoin payment. (In this case BitPay is the payment processor).\n\nOne could also make multiple donations in bitcoin of $100, (up to the total legal limit per campaign cycle), and the only way the campaign can deal with that in any way is if the donor information for each donation is stored in a database, and each and every donation is checked against a database and a running total for each and every entity is maintained, both a fiat total and an equivalent bitcoin value total, and then the appropriate code is written to check each donation against the database of donations made to date and reject those which might exceed a $100 bitcoin limit, or exceed the total amount limits imposed by the FEC.\n\nAnd it gets even more complicated than that, but that\'s proprietary to bitpolitic.com and some people have already figured that stuff out, and more.\n\nThat contribution, whether it is overpayed or underpayed is still documented and the campaign -- IF and ONLY IF the donation exceeds $200, or the AGGREGATE amount of donations from that same entity exceeds $200 during that election cycle -- then and only then must the donation be reported to the FEC along with the donor\'s identifying information.\n\nThe treasurer of the campaign, or, the entity that is managing the bitcoin campaign donations application and strategy then receives an email from BitPay that the contribution amount was overpayed or underpayed and there is an option to then simply reply to that email saying that you wish to either accept the amount, (no matter if it is underpayed or overpayed), or you wish to refund all or some partial amount to the sender. But in order to refund that amount BitPay must have the identifying information of the donor, their name, at least their email address, or other contact information in order to send the bitcoin back to the donor, (to get an address from the donor at which they can then receive the refund), and BitPay will do that for you as BitPay then has custodial ownership of the private keys of any bitcoin donations that do not "clear" your account, that are held in lieu of resolving some issue like underpayment or overpayment of a donation.\n\nSo, if you make a donation to Rand Paul in bitcoin, and you OVERPAY the invoice, but the donor information you supply is false, (and that is a crime), then there is no way that the campaign could refund the balance of your donation, the overpaid portion.\n\nSo technically, one can indeed overpay an invoice and the campaign can then accept more than a $100\'s worth of bitcoin donation, thus exceeding their own campaign imposed limit. And nobody is going to know that except the campaign, the donor, and BitPay. If the donation is LESS than $200, even the FEC would not know that, (if the overpaid donation totaled greater than $100 and less than $200).\n\nIt is possible that BitPay has written some code since the end of the 2014 election cycle in which these 29 candidates for office took bitcoin donations:\n\nhttp://bitpolitic.com/list-of-all-bitcoin-candidates/\n\nIt is possible that some upgrade to the BitPay system exists that ameliorates the overpayment and underpayment of donations, (to some degree), at the invoice payment stage but to my knowledge that does not yet exist.\n\nThere is a defining difference when doing eCommerce with any payment system when comparing the bitcoin payment system to other eCommerce payment methods or systems. All eCommerce payment systems are "pull" payment systems, (except for bitcoin, it is a push payment system), (and of course cash or check in person at the till, that\'s a push payment system, but that\'s not eCommerce). With a "push" payment system the incidence of underpayment or overpayment can be a problem, especially when the value of the payment token might fluctuate such that it breaks an upper or lower bound of value in the time allotted to pay, which is another kettle of fish I dealt with as bitpolitic.com clients faced that issue sometimes, (overpayment or underpayment due to value fluctuation boundary conditions).\n\nAnd most importantly the FEC DOES NOT KNOW if you donated in bitcoin. Campaigns are not required to report to the FEC that the method of payment used was bitcoin, because it is considered an in-kind donation at this time.\n\nAnd as to the argument or the presumption by many parties that the FEC has officially limited the amount of a bitcoin donation to $100, well, that\'s some bogus bullshit. If the FEC has imposed any definitions at all on bitcoin it is ONLY that it is an in-kind donation, and any in-kind donation can have value up to the TOTAL amount of dollars that are allowed as donation in any campaign or campaign\'s election cycle.\n\nThe FEC is only concerned with the AMOUNT of value in dollars the donation represents, that\'s all they care about. ... and campaigns are only required to report the donor information if the donation or aggregate donations from an individual exceed $200 in value.\n\nAs to the speculation that the FEC has imposed some hard limit on bitcoin contributions, (treating them as if they are cash), or has in writing or in some documented announcement formally limited donations to some amount if they are made in bitcoin is completely and absolutely false and totally in error.': 1, 'Can we brigade the FEC? \n': -2, 'I dropped everything I was doing to be first to say this.
