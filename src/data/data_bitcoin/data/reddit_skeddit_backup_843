An address is ripemd160(sha256(pubkey))": 2, 'No this will never happen.\n\nI had a nice write up a while ago but I\'ll explain briefly.\n\nThere are something like 2^256 total bitcoin private keys. There are 2^82 atoms in the universe. It\'s been shown how we don\'t have enough energy/matter in the universe to actually compute them all based on the smallest unit amount of energy theoretically possible to store 1 bit of data. \n\nI think cryptographically secure is considered anything over 2^70. \n\nYour first question:\n\nWouldn\'t the private keys have to be the same? No.\n\nA private/publickey is any 256 digit number. An address is only 160 digits. You are squashing large numbers in to smaller numbers. The large numbers can be different but end up with the same, smaller, hash. It\'s very rare and unlikely to occur.\n\nThat\'s a collision. It doesn\'t have to be big to small, but that murkies the water. In your question it looks like you say "The same private key hashes to the same address twice" and that\'s true. Hashes are one way and the same input always gets the same output. But when the input is larger than the output there is a chance collisions occur.\n\nEssentially you have 160 digits worth of "symbol" combinations to represent 256 digits worth of "data." It\'s just not possible. Think about pouring shots from a bottle of booze. You\'ll never fit the entire bottle in a single shot glass but on very very rare occasions you or someone else will pour a shot with the exact amount of booze in it as you or someone else has at some time in the past. Bad analogy but kind of the same idea.\n\n\nFor your last question. Yeah but no.\n\nSee above about how many numbers there are. It\'s basically the same thing as saying "I start my wallet and it generates a key someone else is using or have used before." It\'s extremely unlikely.\n\nFurthermore, there is something called a birthday attack. I won\'t explain that in depth but Bitcoin is protected from this attack and it is very similar to what you are asking at the end.\n\n\n\n\n': 9, "DUDE...Thank you so much for this!

There may however be indirect ways of stealing people's money with birthday paradox-generated collisions. \n\nE.g. you could create two differing documents, files or messages with the same MD5 hash using the birthday paradox. This in turn could create scenarios where it is possible to steal money. If a collision was ever found with ECDSA+RIPMED it would necessarily result in a switch from RIPMED to some other form of address generation. RIPMED is considered broken anyway. However, the added difficulty created by the de facto impossibleness of going from public key->private key makes ECDSA+RIPMED160 kind of secure. The question is for how long.": 1, "You must have misunderstood my question. We are talking about the birthday paradox. The complexity is thus the square root of the number of possible addresses, i.e. Sqrt(2^160) = 2^80 which could be theoretically doable with today's resources given that you have access to a huge cluster and a lot of time.\n\nYes, you are right. Given a similar transaction count as MasterCard at 51*10^6 transactions per day it would take 7 * 10^28 years until the probability of drawing a used address is below one in a billion and 6 * 10^13 years to have a probability of 2^-80 (an estimate of the current brute force limit).": 1, "There's no point in generating a collision between two of your own addresses.

Wouldn't these keys be the same for all intents and purposes?\n\nEdit: I just had an interesting but slightly unrelated thought. The total money supply will slowly diffuse into more and more addresses as time goes by. Because of the transaction fee, many people will lose a few satoshis here and there because messing up change addresses thus getting balances too low to extract without losing money.

There are no problems with multisig, other than they add another layer of friction that restricts new-coming to acquire and liquidate coin.\n\nMy thoughts on 2/3 multisig is that it loses its value when you\'re working with a centralized *publishing* avenue to find your goods/services (such as WallofCoins.com). *Obviously* the buyer always has their maximum of 1 vote. Obviously the seller always has their maximum 1 vote as well. This leaves Wall of Coins with the final vote anyways, should the seller become unresponsive. Multisig value is only lost at convenience: no newcoming buyer is going to know how to use it at today\'s technological convenience.\n\nI know that will change eventually, but I am working on a solution that does not involve multisig, and I believe it will simulate it and guarantee its extra trust (with buyer and seller\'s combined effort to release the coins)...*without* the seller and buyer *both* needing technical knowledge.\n\nPlans to support multisig?

It is so simple that, if you are not new to bitcoin, you might say to yourself "Where is all the bullshit I\'m accustomed to? What happened to all the hoops I have to jump through?" I recommend that anyone with questions simply connect and buy a small amount of coin. (I wouldn\'t recommend trying to sell just a small amount of coin because you will only get matched to buyers of equal or smaller amounts since there\'s no aggregation happening on the buying side, I imagine because to do so would complicate the buyer\'s experience. At any rate, selling any amount is simple, effective and able to be transparently audited.) There\'s almost no "explaining" the simplicity. I do not miss the hoops or the bullshit and I have practically all but forgotten about other ways to buy and sell bitcoins.\n\nNote: I am not compensated by or affiliated with Wall of Coins however I have met it\'s creator, this guy Rob, a couple months ago through a mutual good friend. I\'ve been to his company\'s office in Sarasota, Florida which is about an hour from where I live. I\'ve given him a little feedback while he developed the site and it was in a private beta phase our friend had invited me to. I have no skin in Rob\'s business beyond that of the obvious benefit that comes with having a quick and easy way to buy coins and super simple way to sell coins while naming my own price. I can also say I meet a lot of nerds through the course of business who talk a big talk and Rob is one of the slim slim few with a real attention to tiny detail, passion for quality and correctness, who has a real understanding of the very many facets of information and financial security.\n\nFYI, I myself am a notorious scam artist and degenerate gambler, so put a dash of salt on my words to fit your taste, but I\'m being totally honest. I have never before been able to recommend to new bitcoin users any method of buying or selling other than "send your money to me and your prayers to God." Hahaha. And now finally, this is a great way I think that both beginners and experts will appreciate.': 4, "Oh and as a note: the site doesn't need or want your identity, that's your bank's concern. IF you are SELLING bitcoin then the site needs your bank account number and it's given to buyers to directly fund your account by physically depositing paper cash money.

At first, let\'s take the benefit of the doubt that you (as a seller) legitimately believe you did not receive the deposit. Does the buyer\'s receipt look legit? Does the photo forensics imagery look legit? Did the buyer perform our request on the receipt and respond in a responsible manner? (These are only in high-suspicion zones.) If we believe the receipt looks legitimate, it is then in the seller\'s best interest to clear this quickly (for the sake of time). If that is rated closer to "trustworthy", now what is the seller\'s response? Willing to get on the phone with their bank? Etc. In the end, even though it\'s still an area of caution: it\'s not hard to prove whether or not a deposit was made by the buyer. If we must spend the resources as a company to dig deeper into an issue, that\'s simply our duty to serve our users.\n\nI understand this does not fully explain, as mentioned earlier this quickly "...turns into a huge web of a flow chart diagram".

There is also direct downloads here: [https://github.com/schildbach/bitcoin-wallet/releases/tag/v4.0](https://github.com/schildbach/bitcoin-wallet/releases/tag/v4.0)\n>\n>Here is what\'s new in v4.0:\n>\n>* All Bitcoin addresses are now deterministically derived from one single secret, which was created when you installed the app for the first time. So from now on, only one backup is needed to recover all your future funds in that wallet.\n>\n>* The app does its best to not reuse addresses any more. "Request coins" will use a fresh address on each invocation. The current address in the QR code on the main page changes as soon as coins are received on it.\n>\n>* When sending coins, the fee is shown while you type and before you press "Send". After sending, you\'ll see the paid fee in the transaction list.\n>\n>* When sending coins, most errors are now shown already before you press Send.\n>\n>* The app now requires Android 4.0.3 or higher. This makes UI development much easier in future.\n>\n>* The app has a fresher, sharper looking app icon. The icon for the testnet version is now entirely grey.\n>\n>* On Android 4.1 or higher, the app-widget is now horizontally resizable.\n>\n>* Based on bitcoinj 0.12.\n>\n>Thanks to everyone participating, especially to all of the bitcoinj team members and the busy translators on Transifex!\xef\xbb\xbf': 7, "Can somebody tell me how the addresses are derived?  I backed up the wallet and decrypted it.  I'm a beginning programmer and I have no idea WTF to do with the protobuf format, but I was still able to clearly make out a few lines in, 12 bip39 words.\n\nHowever, for the life of me, I cannot recreate the address shown on my Bitcoin Wallet app.  I did the Bip39 PBKDF2 specification, with no password, and used that output to generate a Bip32 master key and chain code.  Then I derived the child key for m/44'/0'/0'/0/0, as well as m/0 and m/0'.  None of them match.  (And I've done this with the Mycelium word list and it matched the address my phone showed me.)\n\nCan somebody else tell me how they were able to recreate the address shown on the phone?\n\nAnd can anybody give me a quick helper on how to decipher the protobuf format?  I just need a simple explanation- I'm happy to code it myself if I know what the hell to do.  I've been googling for a half hour and still can't find any specifics on how this fucking format works.  It doesn't seem encrypted, but I still can't understand what I'm looking at.": 7, 'I will be working on a spending PIN right after this update is done.': 7, "it's far too annoying to type a password every time i unlock the phone.  im not confortable with having a short password, and i dont want to re-type 20 random chars every time i want to use my phone.  this way, i can have a strong encryption password, but still not have a hassle every time i pick up my phone to do anything.": 2, "Oh god I requested this a long time ago, glad to see it's coming together!!\n\nNo more address reuse, EVER.": 3, 'BIP44 requires supporting accounts, but for simplicity Bitcoin Wallet has decided against that already some time ago.': 1, "and even if you don't want root, you can still root it, change the password to a longer better one, and still have the simple lockscreen pin, and then un-root it, so now your device encryption password is strong.  and then i use tasker to have it power down after two incorrect pin entries.": 1, 'BIP39 is just a wordlist. It doesn\'t define the hierarchical structure. There is BIP44, but we cannot support that because it mandates the "accounts" which we don\'t have. So we currently support BIP32-hierarchy (default account only).': 3, 'nice': 1, "I'm not too concerned about fund tracking.  How strong are the theoretical attacks?  Afaik, ECC has a robust trap door function, and none of the hash algorithms it uses have been broken in the same way that MD5 was.": 1, 'Address re-use makes it easier to track your funds, and is theoretically weaker due to various attacks.': 3, 'Is there a way to list all the former addresses, or are they completely hidden from sight?': 1, "So someone correct me if I'm wrong. The way I understand it usually the addresses are created in a predictable manner. So you have a random seed essentially. But from that seed addresses are created in a linear progression. So you will always start with address A, followed by B, and C, D, etc. This means when you restore from the seed it restores the addresses In the same manner they where originally generated. The wallet can then check the balance of all of them and know what addresses have Bitcoin and which have been used. It can then fallow this linear time line of generated address and arrived at a point where it can see that the next few address afterwards haven't been used yet and are thus clean. It can then assume that therefore those future address can be ignored and all future possibilities do not need to be checked. \n\nSo for example, I'm not sure how many address an HD wallet can generate but let's say it is 10,000. Now when you restore your wallet can check address one, then address two, three, etc. Then it arrives at 200 and notices that 201, 202, 203, 204, 205 have never been used, maybe it  checks until 400 to be sure. Now since they are always generated in such a linear fashion there is no need to check address 206-1000. This also preserves those address for future use so you don't accidentally use them over again. ": 3, 'For now, you still use traditional backups via files.

Can't you use BIP39 to seed a BIP32 hierarchy?": 3, "Address reuse isn't /that/ bad, but it does make your actions more traceable. With HD wallets there's no cost to generating a new address each time so you might as well do just that.\n\nThe seed  [or rather wallet app] doesn't 'know' which one you're using. It simply generates each address in turn and looks at the blockchain to see if there is any balance on them. Once it finds a few addresses without any balance or transactions in them it stops.\n\nSide note: Don't assume that never reusing addresses grants you perfect privacy. It certainly helps, but it's still possible to perform some tracking.": 1, "Thanks for the info.

This is the best Android wallet there is, and it seems it's getting even better :)": 3, 'I read Mycelium does BIP32+39+44 and I was assuming this was going to work with other wallets as well. Are you saying that other wallets will likely end up with something different?': 4, "There's no problem for that. You don't lose past addresses.": 3, 'Yeah, we kind of have developed a standard given 3 or 4 wallets have used the same method.  Use 12 Bip39 words into the Bip39 pbkdf2 function with no password, then use the resulting output as a bip32 seed to generate a root bip32 private key, and then use bip44 for the accounts and addresses, with the first address on a fresh new bitcoin account being m/44\'/0\'/0\'/0/0.  Trezor, being the first wallet to come out, does exactly the same thing except they have the password "TREZOR" in the bip39 pbkdf2 function.  All other wallets don\'t use a password.\n\nThat seems like an excellent standard to follow IMO.  It allows a 12 word seed, which everybody seems to like, bip44 allows version byte identifiers so different coins can be used, and then there\'s 2\\^31 hardened/non-hardened addresses per depth level, which ought to be plenty.  So you can have one master key for literally every coin that uses secp256k1 for its keys, and you could even have one chain be for multisig parts, and so on.  And with bip39, you can make a word list on any multiple of 4 bytes (32 bits), so people who want more than 128 bits can make longer word lists, and/or use a password in the pbkdf, and/or increase the pbkdf output.  Bip32 uses hmac-sha512, and I\'m guessing that\'s good enough for everybody.\n\nOne of problems with Bip32 is that if you get a private key for a child key, and you have its parent\'s public key, you can work backwords and derive the parent public key, and then repeat the process and go all the way up the chain.  But hardened keys stop that in its tracks.  You can only derive up to a hardened parent but no beyond.  That\'s why the first few levels in m/44\'/0\'/0\'/0/0 are hardened (as denoted by the apostrophe).  So if you get the key for the last zero, and you know the public key for middle 0\', you can derive the private keys for everything below that 0\'... but you can\'t go up any more beyond that.\n\nThe reason ALL keys aren\'t just hardened by default is that you can\'t generate hardened children from parent public keys, and so you need non-hardened keys if you want to manage multiple accounts used by different people, like say a company would.  But the child-private-key-deriving-parent-key problem is why you\'ll always see the chain of accounts almost always being hardened keys right up until the point where you\'re generating the keys that are actually being used.  That way if the private key for that collection gets compromised, you can just increment a notch above the hardened key and stop using that old chain. \n\nGah, I\'m rambling.  The point is, the basic gist of this standard seems really solid all around as far as I\'m concerned.  One 12 word mnemonic for everything, and it\'s perfectly secure.  And you can use it for almost anything, all with just the one root key.': 3, 'The Bitcoin tip for 1 beer (9.964 mBTC/$3.51) has been collected by *BitcoinWallet*.\n\n\n[ChangeTip info](https://www.changetip.com/tip-online/reddit) | [ChangeTip video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AnfKpypMNw) | /r/Bitcoin': 1, '*trolls you by sending minimal amounts to old addresses*': 4, 'True.

However, these libraries are largely protocol-agnostic, so if somebody wants to, he can add Open Assets support.\n\nAs to "why not" it is a long story... Gotta explain the history first.\n\nColored coins standardization effort started in 2012. I wrote the first proposal, and wrote client implementation.\n\nThen in 2013 we were hit by changes in Bitcoin protocol policies, anti-dust rules specifically. Clearly the first proposal (now called OBC, order-based coloring) wasn\'t a way to go, so we tried to design something better, but it was a really painful process.\n\nSo a NGCCC (next-gen colored coins client) project was designed to be able to work with many different \'color kernels\', so that we\'ll be able to choose one in future, or do updates as needed.\n\nFast forward to January 2014, NGCCC is already more-or-less ready, but we still haven\'t decided on "color kernel". Vitalik Buterin was in charge of writing the specification, but then he was bored by lengthy discussions and went off to work on Ethereum.\n\nIt was a pressing issue. I described many different ways to implement a color kernel in the colored coins mailing list, asking for a discussion. And eventually I settled on EPOBC as it satisfied all my requirements.\n\nFlavien Charlon (the creator of CoinPrism and Open Assets) didn\'t like it, and proceed to create Open Assets.\n\nSo, why don\'t we switch to Open Assets? I don\'t like it, it doesn\'t satisfy some of my requirements:\n\n1. Uses issuing address approach, i.e. issuer can add more at any time. (Unless he have lost the private key.) I prefer a different approach where colored coins are issued in finite batches. (I wrote many pages of text explaining why...)\n2. Relies on OP_RETURN, which isn\'t a big problem by itself, but in practice it imposes a tight limit on number of colored outputs. Which won\'t allow us to implement things like transaction aggregation and compaction.\n\nSo we went with epobc as the default kernel. But Open Assets isn\'t bad, might be better for some applications, perhaps we\'ll add it at some point.': 4}, ('How to determine the true price of Bitcoin - the stupid simple version', 13): {'The very very first number in the chart is totally wrong.

Yes the TX cannot be mined. In the article I mentioned tx's can expire. From my research/experience if you broadcast a locked TX it will sit in the mem pool until it is timed to be mined. If a node shuts down the mem pool is cleared. Effectively, for your broadcast TX to 'expire' all nodes with the tx in its mempool would need to be turned off - basically this will never happen.\n\nA second option is printing the transaction and then deleting the keys used to make the tx. You could deposit the coins in a shared multisig wallet between employer and employee. The multisig could send the locked TX for the employee's paycheck two weeks in the future. Without the employer/employee multisig the coins could not be doublespent. \n\nSo there are still use cases for the current functionality but CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY greatly extends functionality by making it possible to lock the coins until the timer expires. I believe this would require something being mined especially since Todd talks about using CHECKLOCK... to replace nLockTime eventually.\n\nSo I believe you are correct, it would have to enter the blockchain right away to prevent those inputs from being claimed on another TX.\n\nYour last part Todd talks about with the proof of burn/proof of mining sacrifice.
