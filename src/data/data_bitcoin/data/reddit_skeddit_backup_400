I just want to address a few points. You keep conflating "block size increase" with "moore\'s law", while those two are mainly unrelated. Please, for the love of God, stop confusing BLOCK SIZE with BLOCK SIZE LIMIT. Seriously, wtf? It was explained like 1000 times already. \n\nThe actual average block size isn\'t affected by the limit increase per se. Natural limits of technology at any given moment keep blocks properly small: miners can mine blocks as small as they need, according to the current state of technological progress available to them. \n\nFurthermore, the very notion of ever exploding blocks, which nearly everyone seems to accept as a self-evident fact (both pro- and con- sides), is merely an assumption almost as optimistic as constantly exponentially growing BTC price. A higher limit merely ALLOWS blocks to grow, not guarantees the growth. \nThink of Bitcoin as a social network, or a messenger, and the number of transactions per second is the usage rate. Bitcoin is a distributed business owned by nobody, and its usage rate growth reflects the success of the business. It may explode exponentially in some year, or it can grow 10% another year, or even decline, if things aren\'t going well. Look at [altcoins](https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/size-btc-ltc-doge-dash-ppc-nmc-blk-vtc-sma7.html), their blocks are empty and flat. Also notice BTC blocks were shrinking for a 3 months in April 2013. \n\nWill we have 8GB blocks by 2034? I hope so, but only if Bitcoin becomes a huge global success and will change the scope of world\'s politics and economics, and for now, we\'re really far from it. It\'s quite possible that by 2034 the blocks will only be 500MB large.\n\n> not really addressing any of the game-theoretic points raised by the small-blockians.\n\nThose arguments were also addressed over 9000 times. In short, miners tend to keep blocks small as possible, they risk orphaning their own blocks by inflating them. \n\n> the dire warnings of the small-blockians about what could happen if a hard-fork were to fail - wow, they do seem really dire!\n\nIt\'s really pointless, unless you want to keep blocks at 1MB FOREVER. A hardfork is inevitable sooner or later, so postponing it is similar to procrastination: as time passes, network gets bigger, we\'re potentially approaching the next bubble, the fork only gets more and more dangerous. So.. what\'s the wait for?\n\n> When I think of thousands of machines around the globe having to lug around multiple identical copies of a multi-gigabyte file containing some asshole\'s coffee purchase forever and ever... \n\nAgain, the amount of micro/macro-transactions made on/off-chain is unrelated to the block limit debate. A hardlimit isn\'t needed to keep microtransactions off-chain. All you need to do is to create a viable attractive higher-layer solution for everyday\'s use and people will use it instead of blockchain. Look at Changetip: they didn\'t ask to raise the fees or keep the limit. Almost every wallet that controls your keeps can send transactions without touching the blockchain. And most users will probably use one of them in future, out of convenience. \n\nMoreover, trying to squeeze transactions into a planned hardlimit would be harmful, since it\'s impossible to predict how large blocks should be at what moment of time in future, with or without a higher layer. The idea "let\'s set a limit, and people will create higher layers" is wrong. It works the other way: "people will create higher layers, and blocks will reduce naturally".': 2, "[damned if you do, damned if you don't](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=damned+if+you+do+damned+if+you+don%27t) is the technical term `;)`   \n   \nscalability is always an issue.\n\nmaidsafe claim to have solved this problem as they require no blockchain, but they still don't have put their system to test in practice.": 1, 'Exactly. There is no debate, bitcoin was always meant to scale. Increasing a cap doesn\'t make blocks larger, increased usage makes blocks larger--and isn\'t a lot of usage a nice "problem" for bitcoin to have! It\'s been the entire point since bitcoin started. \n\nThis is a power grab, an attempt to keep bitcoin from growing, increasing its fees and pushing value out of bitcoin and into alternative systems. If these other systems are so great they should be able to compete on their own merits. \n\nIncrease the cap and let bitcoin continue taking over the world. If there is no consensus from the blockstream folks then they are the ones trying to limit bitcoin by force for their own benefit. Either take them out of the debate or fork the code. Either way the value will follow bitcoin as it was originally intended because that\'s what this has always been about. Blockstream doesn\'t get to force everyone out of bitcoin into their system (which doesn\'t even exist yet), they can compete for the market like every other idea and win or lose on merit.

There seems to be no structured way to resolve the debate and no structured way to introduce changes.\n\nI will propose one such way here: Introduce a feature voting system. Every client, full-node and miner expresses their agreement with a set of features in every transaction that is entered into the blockchain as well as every block that is mined. Come up with a rule/metric that determines when a feature will "activate" that\'s sufficiently disruption free (such as when 90% of miners and 90% of transactions over the past N blocks "agree" to that feature). I realize that the metric would be hotly contested, but at least it would be the last hotly contested issue that needed to be resolved "the hard way".\n\nThis would allow the consensual introduction of features and resolves any deadlock/debate automatically (by whomever can convince most participants in the network to agree to a feature).': 1, 'Is it just me or this is a *very* good post?

Doing so will probably never outright destroy Bitcoin IMO, but it could easily limit decentralization to the point where there are only a few hundred (or maybe even dozen) full nodes in the world.\n* If you think that the most important thing is for Bitcoin to remain decentralized, then you\'ll probably want to make sure that block sizes don\'t increase so fast that they push out too many full nodes, even if this means compromising Bitcoin\'s value as a payment processing network. If Bitcoin *can* support many on-chain payments, then that\'s great, but if not, it\'ll be acceptable for bitcoins to behave like [stone money](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rai_stones) (ironically, Gavin made this comparison with stone money in a speech several years ago).\n\nI guess you\'re not sure what you want Bitcoin to be, so you recognize good arguments, but you don\'t know what people should be arguing *for*.\n\n> So in this "conservative" scenario, I\'m talking about wanting at least 95% pre-adoption agreement\n\nIt\'s also important *who* agrees. I could easily imagine 95% of miners supporting the hardfork while only 40% of everyday users do. Bitcoin is not ruled by miners (or anyone). In fact, it\'s far more important what users decide than what miners decide.\n\n> When Gavin Andresen first came out with the 20 MB thing - I sat back and tried to imagine if I could download 20 MB in 10 minutes (which seems to be one of the basic mathematical and technological constraints here - right?) \n\nTo be a constructive full node, you need to be able to *upload* the block to all of your peers (at least 7) in about 30 seconds. If a big chunk of the network can\'t do this, then the network is going to fall apart; due to *a lack of network-wide upstream capacity*, part of the network will still be downloading blocks many minutes after a block has been published. This increase in block broadcast latency makes it so that the block chain is no longer guaranteed to converge to one particular global chain.\n\nTherefore, 8 MB blocks would require around 15 Mbit/s upstream capacity, which is extraordinary. There are various vague proposals for significantly improving block relay efficiency (IBLT, etc.) which *would* allow the upload/download to be spread across ~5 minutes, but this doesn\'t exist yet.\n\nYou also have to consider that 8 MB blocks would equal 420 GB per year added to the block chain. All existing full node software won\'t even work without downloading the *entire* block chain, and (arguably) it should always be a goal of full nodes to download and verify the entire history. And while there are some not-yet-solid ideas for distributing block chain storage, *someone* will need to store the block chain.\n\nAnother big issue is that even pruned full nodes need to store the UTXO set, but there isn\'t much relationship between block size and expansion of the UTXO set. A 100 kB block can increase the UTXO set size more than a 1 MB block, for example. Probably there should be an additional limit on UTXO set expansion that works similarly to however the max block size ends up being handled.\n\n> When on earth have end-users ever heard of a computer technology whose capacity didn\'t grow pretty much exponentially year-on-year?\n\nThat\'ll happen eventually. No one\'s advocating staying with 1 MB forever. We\'re just not ready quite yet. Once certain necessary technology is added to Bitcoin (IMO, flex cap + improved relaying + UTXO set costs + initial sync improvements + distributed chain storage), the max block size should be able to grow proportionally to worldwide consumer upload speed.\n\n> the stuff about supporting our favorite creators with micropayments\n\nBitcoin was never going to work (directly) with micropayments. Anyone who said so was misinformed.\n\n> Now, correct me if I\'m wrong, but if some guy buys a coffee on the blockchain, or if somebody pays an online artist $1.99 for their work - then that transaction, a few bytes or so, has to live on the blockchain forever? \n\nThere\'s been ongoing debate as to whether it\'d be OK for the network to someday completely forget about transactions. That\'d mean that new full nodes wouldn\'t be able to *completely* be sure that they\'re on the correct Bitcoin network. But if you\'re talking about a transaction that\'s buried under 5+ years of blocks, you can be pretty sure that it\'s valid without needing to actually check it.\n\nIn any case, long-term it will not be the case that you need to download the entire block chain to use Bitcoin Core or even function more-or-less as a full node. It\'s just a question of whether Core should *try* to download the full history in the background once it\'s up and running.\n\nFull nodes will always need to store the UTXO set, so keeping its size down is very important.\n\n> where the hell is Satoshi Nakamoto in all this?\n\nI imagine that he\'s aware that his words would carry way more weight than they should, and he doesn\'t want to unduly influence the community. At this point, the Core devs collectively know way more than Satoshi ever did about Bitcoin.\n\nIf Satoshi actually does issue a statement:\n\n* You should judge his words based on their technical merit. Satoshi is not God. He didn\'t create the world\'s first decentralized money so that we would all be forever bound by his own indomitable will.\n* We should all be ashamed that we mismanaged this issue so severely that we needed some "messiah" to save us.\n\n> Being a C or Python or Java programmer should not be a pre-req to being able to help contribute to the specification (and formal reasoning and program verification) for Bitcoin and the blockchain.\n\nEvery full node needs to apply *exactly* the same consensus rules. There\'s no room for any error whatsoever. English specifications aren\'t sufficient -- it needs to be in code. Using some sort of declarative language isn\'t good because then the compiler or interpreter is itself part of the protocol.  Currently the consensus rules are specified in C++ by the reference implementation. In the future, the consensus rules may be specified in some low-level language (maybe something vaguely similar to Bitcoin\'s own Script), and then this specification will be fed *directly* into a VM that each implementation can design. This separates the specification from the software while preserving the exactness of a reference implementation and allowing implementation-specific optimizations via the VM.': 15, 'For /r/bitcoin?

Blockstream is developing a superstructure for bitcoin called the Lightning Network (LN) where most transactions are supposed to be executed without being entered into the blockchain.  The solution to the scalability problem that Blockstream favors is to take most person-to-person bitcoin traffic off the blockchain, and drive most bitcoin users to the LN (which will not work unless most bitcoin users are LN users).  Then the blockchain would be used only by settlements among the hubs of the LN.\n\nTherefore, Blockstream is anxious to see the bitcoin network get saturated.  That would force a steep increase in the transaction fees, to the point that  direct p2p use of the blockchain would become too expensive for most users, and only high-value transaction (like the hub-to-hub settlements of the LN) could afford to use it.\n\nWith 1 MB blocks, congestion would probably happen within a couple of years.

The ostensible bank employees reported anonymously that his institute had been asked by its respective Supervisory Authority to report each customer, could be observed in the payments, which can be associated with Bitcoin and exceed the \xe2\x82\xac 1,000. The present report contains the statement to him that 84 accounts had been featured in his own country, of which 52 were under observation. Prior to the recent prompt the Bank was only obliged to report inputs of more than \xe2\x82\xac 10,500 a year. Furthermore, the request would be a report from Europol on why he bet on an EU-wide action.\n\nFirst, however, the user would not comment on his country, then he added his report with a link to a previous report " of its Financial Services Authority ", which leads to a document by the Netherlands\' Finance Intelligence Unit", comparable to the corresponding unit of the Bundeskriminalamt .\n\nThe 80-page case report contained some IBAN numbers to known exchanges like Kraken.com , Bitcoin.de or Bitstamp.net belong. Must be reported, when bank customers received transfers of over \xe2\x82\xac 1,000 of these IBAN numbers. In addition, should be tested if payments over \xe2\x82\xac 10,500 per year, which are not salaries, could come from Bitcoin exchanges.\n\nAn employee of a European trading platform confirmed in an interview with Cointelegraph.de that the Reddit report sounded plausible. Bitcoin exchanges are often unwilling to divulge information about their clients only on presentation of court decisions, which is why it makes sense from his perspective that contact the authorities to the banks.\n\nIt is unclear who might thus have in his sights precisely Europol. It seems unlikely that drug dealers are running on regular checking accounts their income to \xe2\x82\xac 1,000 can also not necessarily indicative of particularly successful dealer. Perhaps therefore it comes to research on child pornography.

Propagation delays need to be factored in here.\n\n2) The reduction in the per-block fee may accelerate a risk I noted a few months ago in which there may be an incentive for a miner to try to steal an earlier block reward by re-mining a previous block and then mining a new one at a point where fees become larger than the block reward. This is a long-term systemic risk right now irrespective, but reducing block times and reducing block rewards per block would risk making this happen sooner.\n\nNot so much a risk, but certainly an issue is that for SPV clients we\'d really want to stop talking about "number of confirmations" and switch to "minutes of confirmation" instead.

This is oversimplifying a bit, but if **I** is the nominal interval between blocks, **U** - time to *upload* a block and **L** - connection latency, then the loss due to orphans is proportional to **(U+L)/I**. Suppose we change **I** and **U** changes with the same factor. For U>>L it doesn't make much of a difference for losses due to orphans. But if we decrease **I** a lot (even 10 times) then **L** may become a significant contributor to losses. Latency is physically limited by the speed of light, therefore the ultimate way to reduce it significantly would be for miners to relocate closer to each other, thus incentivizing geographical centralization.

Why not just use an altcoin ? They are not going away anytime soon. ": -11, 'Care to explain?': 1, 'Catching up with old mail here;  please excuse this belated reply.\n\nA quick note about bandwidth vs. throughput though, since this is an incredibly common misconception.  Throughput is actually bandwidth * (1 / latency).  The misconception is subtle as you\'ll see.  Think of bandwidth as how wide a pipe is.  For example a water pipe.  The wider the pipe, the more water (i.e. data) can be transmitted through it per minute.  This is "bandwidth."  And you can see why it\'s tempting to leave it at that since it seems to be a straight forward data over time equation (which typically equals speed).  But there\'s more.  Latency (i.e. ping) is how slow that water is actually moving.  In plumbing this would equate to pressure (or voltage if you\'re into electrical stuff).  So the pipe width (bandwidth) might accommodate 1 gallon per minute if drained by gravity.  But if you were to force the water down, faster than its normal drain rate, you can get more water through the same pipe size per that same given minute.  In essence latency is the actual speed of a single piece of data, whereas bandwidth is how much data can be transferred per that speed.\n\nBoth latency and bandwidth are critical.  Consumer ISPs don\'t advertise based on latency because it\'s difficult for them to determine what your latency will be, and its hard for them to regulate it (for different payment schemes) like they can with bandwidth.\n\nSo both are important, but not fully interchangeable.  If you\'re downloading movies and big files, then bandwidth is better for you.  But if you\'re just hitting up a bunch of websites as part of your work, or playing an online first-person shooter then low latency is what counts.\n\nDisregarding up and down rates, most professionals and businesses will prefer a lower bandwidth, but with lower latency (faster ping) connection than a higher bandwidth, but with higher latency (slower speed) connection.  The reason being that for most internet use, what makes the most difference to the user, is lower latency.\n\n\nHere\'s someone else\'s example:\n\n> Bandwidth is the amount of data that you can transfer per unit time.\n\n> Latency is the time it takes for the signal to transfer from one location to another.\n\n> As an example, if I was to take a cargo container ship full of hard drives, and ship it from San Diego to Japan, the bandwidth would be extremely high, even compared to the internet. But it may take two weeks to get there (latency). This shows that bandwidth has absolutely nothing to do with latency.\n\n\nHere\'s a paper written about it by a Stanford student back in \'96 (never mind his paper\'s title):\n\nhttps://rescomp.stanford.edu/~cheshire/rants/Latency.html\n\n\nHis key analogy being:\n\n\n> Part of the problem here is misleading use of the word "faster".\nWould you say that a Boeing 747 is three times "faster" than a Boeing 737? Of course not. They both cruise at around 500 miles per hour. The difference is that the 747 carries 500 passengers where as the 737 only carries 150. The Boeing 747 is three times bigger than the Boeing 737, not faster.\n\n\n> Now, if you wanted to go from New York to London, the Boeing 747 is not going to get you there three times faster. It will take just as long as the 737.\n\n\n> In fact, if you were really in a hurry to get to London quickly, you\'d take Concorde, which cruises around 1350 miles per hour. It only seats 100 passengers though, so it\'s actually the smallest of the three. Size and speed are not the same thing.\n\n\n> On the other hand, If you had to transport 1500 people and you only had one aeroplane to do it, the 747 could do it in three trips where the 737 would take ten, so you might say the Boeing 747 can transport large numbers of people three times faster than a Boeing 737, but you would never say that a Boeing 747 is three times faster than a Boeing 737.\n\n\n> That\'s the problem with communications devices today. Manufacturers say "speed" when they mean "capacity". The other problem is that as far as the end-user is concerned, the thing they want to do is transfer large files quicker. It may seem to make sense that a high-capacity slow link might be the best thing for the job. What the end-user doesn\'t see is that in order to manage that file transfer, their computer is sending dozens of little control messages back and forth. The thing that makes computer communication different from television is interactivity, and interactivity depends on all those little back-and-forth messages.\n\n\n> The phrase "high-capacity slow link" that I used above probably looked very odd to you. Even to me it looks odd. We\'ve been used to wrong thinking for so long that correct thinking looks odd now. How can a high-capacity link be a slow link? High-capacity means fast, right? It\'s odd how that\'s not true in other areas. If someone talks about a "high-capacity" oil tanker, do you immediately assume it\'s a very fast ship? I doubt it. If someone talks about a "large-capacity" truck, do you immediately assume it\'s faster than a small sports car?\n\n\n> We have to start making that distinction again in communications. When someone tells us that a modem has a speed of 28.8 kbit/sec we have to remember that 28.8 kbit/sec is its capacity, not its speed. Speed is a measure of distance divided by time, and \'bits\' is not a measure of distance.\n\n> I don\'t know how communications came to be this way. Everyone knows that when you buy a hard disk you should check what its seek time is. The maximum transfer rate is something you might also be concerned with, but the seek time is definitely more important. Why does no one think to ask what a modem\'s \'seek time\' is? The latency is exactly the same thing.

Even as it is, there is a small unevenness of stale rates based on location (relative to other miners) alone. The original design of Bitcoin has made this fundamental tradeoff (consciously or not) with this centralizing tendency. Decreasing the block interval, unlike increasing the block size limit, makes this particular phenomenon worse.

Due to the power loss, nation-states don\'t run around giving up their monetary sovereignty willy-nilly.  For example, EU nations have to see some upside to join the EU and give up their ability to print their own currency, and the UK still doesn\'t see enough upside to bother giving up the power and joining the currency union.  \n\nSo there is some power loss, but it\'s small enough that an upside like establishing a free-trade zone or a mutual defense pact is usually enough to offset it and make it worthwhile to give up.  This idea that the loss of power is so large that it will "end the nation state", as proposed in the article, is preposterous.  Governments under the gold standard or that have given up their ability to print money are almost as powerful as ones that can print.\n\nThen you\'ve got a secondary argument going about how governments and banks are going to be forced to use bitcoin and do all their transacting on the blockchain, which will end FRB, loans, and spending before taxing.

Even worse, you mention the interest rate determining the amount of risk without recognizing that issuing new money is *exactly* what distorts the interest rate to such insanely idiotic levels as 0%!  THIS is because the institutions that are issuing this new money, can freely manipulate its supply and price.

If Bitcoin becomes a massively used "currency of the internet," government will likely find themselves facing the same problem, and even a small portion of the population losing trust in a currency can greatly affect its price and stability.
