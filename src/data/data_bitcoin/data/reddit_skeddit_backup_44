So without any need of signaling, when they see that SatoshiDice transactions are being systematically refused for a long time, they can soft-fork them out (concrete example irrelevant; SatoshiDice spam non-mining nodes but do no harm to miners as long as their txs pay enough fees).\n\nOne problem I see with that, though, is that regular nodes --the economical majority-- will not be enforcing that soft-fork. Therefore, it would be a for-most-practical-purposes soft-fork more than a theoretical soft-fork. What I mean is that real soft-forks need a hard-fork to revert them, but tacit, secret soft-forks can be dropped at any time; incentives would prevent the risk of a secret hard-fork in this case: Even after tacit no-SD agreement, if one block then appears with a SD transaction in it, nodes will still accept it as valid and so rational miners -ignoring if the tacit soft-fork has been suddenly dropped- would better mine on top of it. This because a hard-fork is potentially catastrophic and the most recent non-tacit, explicit set of rules is then a Schelling point.': 2, 'Oh, and in many cases it is more than a Schelling point as there would be other incentives.

Bitcoin core on my desktop, with a few things fixed, can "handle" multiple gigabyte blocks, but that doesn\'t mean that a decentralized system can be formed out of it; that anyone would run it, or that I can get the bandwidth to support it (I couldn\'t, not with normal broadband service). As the block sizes has grown the node count has almost monotonically fallen in absolute numbers even while the user base is orders of magnitude larger, and even though the software is many times faster-- the improvements so far have not been enough at the current load. Separately, Without a fee market we have no coherent answer to long term security, a fact also pointed out in academic research (which has happily been ignored).\nThese are also not mere hypotheticals... in 2013 as blocksizes grew mining became incredibly centralized with almost all the hashrate being pointed at just a couple large pools in order to mitigate orphan rate; this actually enabled pool compromise theft on the scale of 1000 BTC from a Bitcoin using service. Matt created the block relay protocol to mitigate the bandwidth mediated pressure towards centralization and it has helped push back the clock on that; we already know from experience how the system responds to scaling pressure: it centralizes because centralization directly, immediately, and without any coordination divides the scaling costs. Centralized is the most efficient configuration of the system.\n\n--Greg Maxwell\n\nThis is one dimension of the problem that you have a half-way understanding of. You understand that there exist nodes that can operate with larger blocks, but you don\'t understand that they won\'t necessarily operate just because they can. You could make every full node operator pay $10 more per month, and they could pay, but why would they pay when they can just pay nothing externalize the costs in the form of reduced network safety.\n\nOnce again, this is only one dimension of the problem, there are many ways this harms Bitcoin and it is foolish to ignore them. I dug up an old summary of the problems for you:\n\n* What software should the core developers make available? If I were to dictate to the developers what they should do I would ask first that they not violate the security of Bitcoin. An important component of Bitcoin is trustlessness, without it, we might as well drop the blockchain and pick up a more efficient system. There are other goals one might have like "does this keep Bitcoin cheap" or "is this what Satoshi said he wanted", however I don\'t see the point of achieving these goals if loss of trustlessness is the cost.\n\nGeneral mining situation:\n\n* So does increasing the blocksize put trustlessness in jeopardy? Like most things in security it isn\'t black and white. The mining ecosystem becomes less secure and more centralized when there is a larger network load. It is a reaction that is caused by the cost of supporting the networks security becoming greater than its benefits. For example, every mining pool member could effectively take the control back from the pool and generate their own blocks, causing a huge decrease in the trust we are required to put in these pools. There is, however, a cost to these individual miners running a full node including additional latency for the pool users, additional resources for the pool if they are using the relay network, and many many other factors that increase as the block size increases.\n\nBenefits to big miners:\n\n* This isn\'t limited to individual miners in pools either, a certain Chinese mining pool was not validating blocks due to the stales that would be caused, though this can be improved partially with IBLT. The cause of the pool not validating was that their geographic separation from other mining pools made it more expensive to mine fully validating. It actually is very efficient to have all your miners in a geographically centralized area, like a single warehouse, and it becomes even more efficient as the network load increases. In general, as blocks become bigger there is a centralizing effect to the mining ecosystem and that causes the requirement of trust, the antithesis of Bitcoin.\n\nGetting small miners to run full nodes:\n\n* I usually get responses like "These miners can afford to run full nodes", but the question isn\'t whether they can run full nodes, it is whether they will! At what point does a miner benefit from a full node? A 0.1% miner may realize that the expenses of running a full node cut into their profits by 5%, and then through a rough estimate realize that their 0.1% of hash power belonging to a large mining pool doesn\'t harm the network, and by extension them that much. This leads to them not running a full node. The minimal hash power required for "profitable" validation varies based on factors including the loss of profit through latency caused by geographic placement, the gain in personal "profit" through the enjoyment that comes from running a full node as a hobby. However, as a general trend, the minimal hash power someone will run a full node at decreases and the cost of a full node increases.\n\nDecreasing attack cost with higher network load: \n\n* At this point, this economy of scale induced effect has led to miners being massive, the largest two miners individually can both reverse a confirmation with 40% probability of success. Combined, they can reverse 6 confirmations with 75% success. This is quite dangerous considering that a single government may attack Bitcoin relatively cheaply, or a profit-seeking miner may decide to attack as we have seen before with the 3000BTC GHash.io theft.\n\nIncreasing attack benefit with higher network load:\n\n* One of the main differences between a miner attacking an SPV-using merchant and a full-node-using merchant is the ability to forge money out of thin air that can\'t be spent in a reorg. If you, an economical and malicious miner, want to rip off a merchant running a full node, you need to send them YOUR (or your partners) money and **then** spend your hashing power (money) attempting to steal their money. When you rip off a merchant running an SPV node, you can create money out of thin air, create invalid blocks, then be guaranteed that your payment will be reversed. There is no up front cost other than the electricity of your mine and you can block withhold to make your attack much more likely to succeed than the reorg attack mentioned in the full node example. In short, many SPV nodes make miner attacks much more profitable and likely to succeed. But it\'s not like full nodes don\'t have to be worried, they too can be caught up in the attack because including a full node target in the attack doesn\'t cost additional mining resources. The number of full nodes online doesn\'t matter nearly as much as the number and fraction of merchants validating payments with full nodes.\n\nConclusion:\n\n* We must consider this centralizing effect caused by large blocks and work towards making mining decentralized and the ecosystem safer by reducing the system load. This can be accomplished by having the blocksize increase at a rate lower than the rate at which hardware and software changes decrease the expenses caused by block size.': 2, '>Past the one-time locking cost, it is much more useful to have the coins on the LN (nearly free txs, O(n) scalability, instant confirmations) than siting untouched on a hot wallet.

If Bitcoin usage continues to grow at its current rate, the worldwide Bitcoin network by the end of 2016 would require more energy consumption than is currently generated globally.\n\nThe success of digital currency has always been predicated upon the ability of its designers and advocates to appropriately evolve and adapt.

Morgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc. have successfully tested the record-keeping technology behind bitcoin on credit-default swaps, a move that could help it gain a foothold in mainstream finance.\n\nThe swaps are essentially insurance contracts that pay off if a bond goes bad, and the process of keeping track of the over-the-counter products can be a burden. Banks match buyers and sellers, transmit the trades via a service run by data provider Markit Ltd. and send a record to Wall Street\xe2\x80\x99s central bookkeeper, Depository Trust & Clearing Corp.\n\nThe new test showed that a portion of that record-keeping task could be accomplished using \xe2\x80\x9cblockchain,\xe2\x80\x9d a common ledger that each party can view in much the same way that multiple users can work on shared computer documents.\n\nDTCC will now discuss whether the results are strong enough to warrant using the technology for live trades or across a broader swath of credit-default swaps, a market with trillions of dollars in outstanding contracts.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe ink is still drying on the results, but they are positive,\xe2\x80\x9d said Chris Childs, chief executive of the DTCC unit that oversees over-the-counter derivatives.\n\nThe test helps make the case for using blockchain in core Wall Street activities. While alternative currency bitcoin itself has been embroiled in legal battles and volatility, the underlying ledger\xe2\x80\x94which can be edited anywhere and instantly validated\xe2\x80\x94has drawn heavy interest from mainstream finance.\n\nBig banks recently have invested teams of people and millions of dollars finding ways to apply private blockchains to cut out middlemen and save money. Barclays PLC on Wednesday announced a partnership with bitcoin startup Circle Internet Financial Ltd. to enable the digital-currency startup\xe2\x80\x99s mobile app to send and receive British pounds and to swap them for U.S. dollars.\n\nAnalysts at Autonomous Research say using blockchain could cut trading settlement costs by a third, or $16 billion a year, and cut capital requirements by $120 billion. A recent report by Citigroup forecast that automation including blockchain could eliminate two million banking jobs, largely in processing, over the next decade.\n\nThe new test replicated a month\xe2\x80\x99s worth of trades in the single-name credit default swap market, which has a total of $6.7 trillion in face value of outstanding contracts, not accounting for offsetting trades, according to DTCC figures. Electronic CDS agreements on individual servers were replaced with a record on a shared blockchain network.\n\nThe test included Bank of America Corp. and Credit Suisse Group AG, which worked with J.P. Morgan, Citigroup, Markit and technology firm Axoni, a new venture focused on applying the bitcoin technology of blockchain to banking.\n\nMarkit has about half-dozen active blockchain projects, but the CDS test is \xe2\x80\x9cthe most real proof-of-concept going on,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeffrey Billingham, vice president in Markit\xe2\x80\x99s processing division and a lead in its \xe2\x80\x9cChain Gang\xe2\x80\x9d testing blockchain uses. The test \xe2\x80\x9crevealed to everybody the ways you can improve efficiencies and minimize costs.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAny live implementation of blockchain in swaps trading could be years away. DTCC says the next step is testing the appetite of other banks and regulators to use blockchain in the market. Some may be reluctant to make changes that threaten their own market share or introduce new complexity to current systems that have been tested and refined over the years.\n\nDTCC, a bank-owned utility, will be an important player. It handles settlements for quadrillions of dollars worth of transactions. While bitcoin and blockchain were intended to eliminate the need for a middleman, DTCC has argued that U.S. regulators would likely still require oversight by a central body.\n\nRegulators including the Federal Reserve, Commodity Futures Trading Commission and Securities and Exchange Commission say they are monitoring blockchain.\n\nLast week, DTCC said it had separately started working with Digital Asset Holdings LLC, the startup led by former J.P. Morgan executive Blythe Masters, to see whether short-term lending arrangements between dealers known as repos could be settled using blockchain.': 26}, ('Is it to late to buy an S7?', 0): {"Even if you order it and it shipped today, you would be a year out until break even (even being very optimistic).\n\nHere's the math:\n\nCost of a unit: ~1.37 bitcoin ($575), not including shipping even.\n\nThe unit does 4.73 TH/s.  That produces ~0.0137 bitcoin/day at the current difficulty (worth $$5.75 at the current exchange rate).\n\nElectric consumpton: 1.3kW X 24h = 31.2 kWh.
