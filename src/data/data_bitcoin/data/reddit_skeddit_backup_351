': 9, "Please point the broken part with the right solution if the information leads you to be able to. I'll send your report to them.\n\n**The Problem**\n\nSuppose somebody (M) wants to implement a MiTM-attack on Diffie\xe2\x80\x94Hellmann Key Exchange between A and B, so that the spoofed shared keys between A and M and between B and M have same hash value (used for key visualization and verification).\n\nLet us denote the hash function in question by H(x); it takes b-bit values. For our application, b=128 and H(x) = first 128 bits of SHA1(x).\n\nLet (p,g) be the public Diffie-Hellman parameters; it makes sense to use the same parameters between A and M and between B and M, which can be accomplished if the parameters are supplied by M (as in our case). Denote by n the number of bits in p. In our case, n=2048.\n\nNow, once A supplies M with its g_1 = g^u mod p and B supplies M with g_2 = g^v mod p, the problem is to find x and y, such that H(g_1^x)=H(g_2^y).\n\n**Birthday paradox**\n\nAn obvious approach, based on the birthday paradox, is to scan 2^{b/2} values of x (say, from an arithmetic progression, or by taking powers of two modulo (p-1)/2, so that the next value of g_1^x mod p is computed from the previous by one multiplication modulo p ), store and sort resulting H(g_1^x), repeat the same process for 2^{b/2} values of y, then compare sorted lists looking for the collision sought.\n\nHowever, this requires O(2^{b/2}) modular multiplications and hash (SHA-1) computations, and, more importantly, O(b.2^{b/2}) bits of memory to keep the intermediate results.\n\nThere are several approaches which require less memory, but still O(2^{b/2}) modular operations, this time exponentiation mod p (which is usually a thousand times more complex operation). They use cycle finding in some form.\n\n**Cycle Finding**\n\nCycle finding is usually applied for detecting collisions for one hash function. In our case, we have to find collision between two hash functions H_1(x):=H(g_1^x) and H_2(y):=H(g_2^y) from {0,1}^n into {0,1}^b.\n\nHowever, this problem can be reduced to that for one hash function, if we are ready to replace n with n+1: consider H_0 from {0,1}^{n+1} to {0,1}^b, given by H_0(2x):=H_1(x), H_0(2y+1):=H_2(y). Once we find a hash collision for H_0 on arguments of different parity, we obtain a hash collision between H_1 and H_2. On average, one collision in two will have the required property, so we'll have to find two-three collisions for H_0.\n\nNext, we need a projection function g from {0,1}^b into {0,1}^{n+1}, so as to reduce finding collisions for H_0 to finding collisions for f(x):=H_0(g(x)). An obvious choice is to map {0,1}^b into {0,1}^{n+1} by adding n+1-b leading zero bits. This has the advantage of making the exponents for modular power elevation smaller.\n\nSo we are reduced to finding pairs distinct b-bit values z and z', such that f(z)=f(z'). We might start from a random z_0, construct z_n:=f(z_{n-1}), and use, say, Pollard rho method to find a loop in this sequence. This would require O(1) memory, but O(2^{b/2}) unparallelalizable computations of f(z).\n\n**Distinguished values**\n\nA better approach, allowing some parallelization at the expense of some memory, is to start from a randomly chosen z_0, construct sequence z_n as before, stopping if a loop is detected by Pollard rho, but in addition storing triple (z_n,z_0,n) into a special table whenever z_n happens to be distinguished (say, has t leading bits equal to 0, for suitably chosen t < b ). Once a distinguished value is reached, processing stops, and a new random value of z_0 is chosen to construct a new sequence z_n.\n\nThis might be done in parallel, starting from several randomly chosen values of z_0.\n\nOnce the same value of first component in the results table appears twice, we are likely to have found a collision, reconstructing the two colliding sequences from their (distinct) values of z_0.\n\nThis requires O(2^{b/2}) n-bit modular power elevation operations with a table for O(2^{b/2-t}) b-bit values. The computation can be done in parallel on up to O(2^{b/2-t}) processor cores if t is suitably chosen. For example, we might take t=32 for b=128, thus requiring several gigabytes of memory, but allowing parallel computation on billions of cores.\n\n**Required Resources**\n\nWe still need to compute O(2^{b/2}) = O(2^{64}) powers with 128-bit exponents modulo 2048-bit prime p, and the same amount of SHA-1 hashes.\n\nEach such power computation would require several million clock cycles on a modern CPU core (tens of thousands cycles for each modular multiplication). Let us assume that it requires two million cycles on a 2GHz core, so that one core can perform thousand such operations per second.\n\nA modern 8-core CPU (with hyperthreading, which will barely help us here since the problem is CPU-intensive) costs about 500$ and consumes about 50 Watt of power.\n\nIn this way, we can perform 8000 (let us replace this with 10^4) such operations per second on 500$ equipment consuming 50 Watt of electric power.\n\nWe have to perform about 2^{64} ~ 2 * 10^{19} operations (actually, several times more \xe2\x80\x94 say, twice as much) to find a collision of requested form.\n\nIf we wish to achieve this, say, in one month (clearly too long a time to expect the parties not to worry about the delay of their DH key exchange), i.e. in 2 * 10^6 seconds, we'll need 2 * 10^9 (two billion) 500$ CPUs, worth a trillion dollars.

After that, if both clients trust the server software, the Secret Chats between them are protected by the server from MiTM attacks.\n\nThe interface offers a way of comparing Secret Chat keys for users who do not trust the server. Visualizations of the key are presented in the form of identicons ([example here](https://telegram.org/img/key_image.jpg)). By comparing key visualizations users can make sure no MITM attack had taken place.\n\n**Hash collisions for Diffie-Hellman Keys**\nA 128-bit fingerprint is used to create the key visualization.

I thought the days of people defending closed-source crypto would finally have died with Edward Snowden\'s revelations, but I am apparently incorrect.\n\nWhile the extensions and apps built on top of Telegram are certainly useful, my critique of the platform arises specifically *because* it is touted as "ultra-secure" when it is in fact *not*. If they simply marketed it as an extensible messenger application, without such an emphasis on its "security," I would have no qualms with it - in fact, I would probably give it my full support! However, Telegram\'s marketing is very explicit about its "security," when in fact there are numerous demonstrated flaws with their cryptography and security model in general. And because they make those claims, they deserve to be held to account for them - and they are found wanting.\n\nWith an unlimited budget, it is true that some attacks may be feasible against TextSecure, but at the moment, **none** of those attacks are significantly more practical than a simple brute-force of the total keyspace. **That** is what a properly designed and implemented cryptosystem achieves, and what Telegram most certainly does not. The difference is an important one.\n\nI am honestly baffled by your insistence at defending, as if it is your own child, this poorly-designed, partially-closed source, dishonest and deceptively marketed app for which superior alternatives are available (at least for the communications components, with other features like bitcoin purchasing available through additional, supplemental apps). My critiques of Telegram are not critiques of *you*, nor does your use of Telegram somehow make you a bad person or stupid - merely an uninformed one, which I am attempting to correct. I\'m sure you\'re a nice enough person and so I am trying to help you (and others here) make more informed decisions about the ways that you secure your communications. That\'s my only goal, here. You are, of course, welcome to ignore the information that I\'m offering, but you do so at your own expense, and in doing so you may very well cross the threshhold between merely uninformed and downright obstinant, or even foolish.

Anyone can create a digital currency. No problem. But if someone wants to 'create' a Bitcoin it needs to validated by the network as genuine. A Bitcoin is really a human understandable term. The 'coin' is in fact just an agreement by the network that a transaction has happened and you cant create a coin. A programmer would have to inject a transaction into the system that every miner agreed happened. However this new transaction that is artificially created would have to be linked back in the chain to an already valid transaction. Since a valid transaction would be 'owned' by someone else then the new one could not become valid and would be ignored.\n\n3. Bitcoins are created by the result of successful mining. Processing transactions produces mathematical results that turn into new digital currency. The network agrees that someone has done this work. The reward is new Bitcoins.\n\n": 1, '1. I think it\'s beneficial to point out that most people cannot and should not try to mine. Most mining nowadays is in large warehouse style mining rigs and teams of people with specialty equipment. It\'s an investment for people who REALLY know what they\'re doing.  That being said- the basic reason for mining is that it is a function to record and protect the integrity of all the transactions being made in the Bitcoin network. The bitcoins "mined" are the reward to computers for providing the electric and computational resources required to maintain the network.\n\n2. THOUSANDS of people are doing exactly that. Because Bitcoin is open source, people have copied the code and started there own. The most popular is Litecoin. Some have interesting ideas and qualities to them. Some are even built on top of Bitcoin itself. Most are completely garbage. Even the good ones will probably never be worth much because Bitcoin solves the majority of problems altcoins solve AND it\'s network is vastly larger and more developed and accepted. Some people try to push their altcoin and pump it\'s price to attract people to buy it before selling off as much as they can. My suggestion- stay farrrr away unless you\'ve been around the Bitcoin community for awhile and see the lifecycle of these coins. And even then 99/100 times they aren\'t worth messing with. \n\n3. bitcoins are first created by a "block" being mined. This happens around once every ten minutes. It\'s when a computer set up to mine finds a special number by inputting as many numbers as possible as fast as possible into a specific equation to come up with a certain kind of number. These equations make it very easy for anyone who finds a number to prove that it is the right kind of number, but very hard to find a new one that hasn\'t been found yet. It\'s like prime numbers. They are hard to find because as the numbers increase they become rarer- but once you find one you can easily prove they are a prime number. When a computer finds the number it announces to the network that it has found one and if the network accepts it, that computer is awarded a set amount of coins. **The network  (through consensus) is the entity granting new coins.** Keep in mind there is a set limit of 21 million coins. Once all of them are mined, the mining computers will only receive coins provided by transaction fees. So there will never be more than 21 million coins in existence. \n\nThere is much more to Bitcoin than just a currency (however that is a big part of it) Each coin can have information added to it- so companies like Nasdaq are exploring its potential.

Bernstein and Tanja Lange suspect, per [SafeCurves](http://safecurves.cr.yp.to)) then Bitcoin will find a hard time moving to a different curve, especially given the massive number of implementations/libraries in all sorts of languages.\n\nBeyond those few points off the top of my head, remember that any move towards transactional privacy in Bitcoin's protocol will start from scratch - there will be no usable and large anonymityset, and thus it will have to build up over time and at great risk to those requiring that privacy.\n\nAdditionally, there's also time that will pass between now and when Bitcoin eventually (if ever) has privacy baked into its core. It is quite possible - maybe even likely - that in that time Monero will carve out a niche for those use-cases that require transactional privacy. Thus it will continue to be a viable store of value, as those pro-privacy users will be the ones that set the market value.

Bitcoin and MyCoin are now operating side by side and completely accurate in their own contexts but different.\n\nThe same thing applies to a bug between an implementation of bitcoin core and bitcoin.\n\nIf the bitcoin developer doesn\'t fix the bug, then a fork in the blockchain occurs. They both continue to operate as if they are correct and two incompatible networks arise. The only way to "fix" the problem is for one of them to get back in alignment with the other.

Full copies of the block chain retain both blocks.  Miners then start building on one or the other block, and one of them will end up being solved first, but likely *not* at the same time.  That chain is now the longer one, and the basic algorithm assumes "most effort chain is the correct one".  Since mining difficulty changes infrequently, most effort translates to most blocks in a chain.\n\nSo soft forks are usually resolved quickly.  If people are running different versions of the software, like one allows only 1 MB blocks, and the other allows 2 MB blocks, then one version will reject blocks that the other one allows.  That\'s a hard fork, because no amount of building the chain will make the software accept larger blocks.  One side or the other will be the minority, and most people will jump from the minority chain from fear of being "left behind with worthless coins" that the majority will no longer accept.\n\nProposed software changes like this typically include a delay to give people time to install the new version.

Ukraine wanted to join EU and NATO, and was invaded for the same reason. The other interest that Putin had in a war with Ukraine is that thanks to oil prices dropping, Russia\'s economy completely tanked, and Putin\'s ratings went down as well. By waging a war, he was able to create a "common enemy" that everyone in Russia can fear, hate, and rally around defeating, and it brought up his ratings, as well as that of the rest of the government.

He wasn\'t just a common protester. And he and others talked to the rest of the people there. Their reason was that the pro-russian president was elected on promises he didn\'t keep, didn\'t want to join EU despite that being one of his promises, tried to change the constitution to give himself permanent presidency with dictatorial powers, and once the protests started, declared that anyone who protests will automatically get a minimum 15 years in prison. At that point the protesters only had two options: quit and go to prison, or stay until he is kicked out.\n\nRussia started this by first ordering their puppet to shoot at the protesters. Yanukovich actually refused to shoot at his own people, so good on him, so then Russia brought in their own snipers, and that\'s when the shooting on Maidan began. Many of the "Ukrainian" snipers who were shooting at protesters were photographed, and then later recognized as the exact same people righting as Russian soldiers in the east.\n\nRussia then followed up by creating a massive propaganda campaign (which you unfortunately fell for) claiming that Ukraine is being overrun by nazis and is going to elect a nazi as their president (turned out Ukraine voted less fascist than even UK and France). People in the east panicked, then russian troops, or russian funded criminals, started a shooting war there, increasing the panic, and a vote was held on whether to stay with Ukraine or secede.

The official UN numbers are a complete lie and fabrication, for whatever reason, they don't want people to realize the true scope of the conflict (probably because it would look bad for Kiev since they sent 10's of thousands of people to their deaths.)\n\nThe majority of deaths are Rebel troops and Ukrainian soldiers, plus volunteer battalions. The Ukrainian Army has lost somewhere around 20-30 thousand men killed, and so has the militia. In reality, both sides vastly understate their losses. Overall, the Ukrainians lost more men killed than the militia because of the numerous times Ukrainian Army ended up being surrounded in cauldrons during failed offensive operations, resulting in thousands of their men being killed at once by artillery fire with no way to fight back.\n\nDuring the Southern Cauldron alone when Ukraine Army soldiers were surrounded and pounded with artillery, the Ukraine Army lost somewhere around 3 thousand men killed. That was during ONE operation. During the Ilovaisk boiler, Kiev lost somewhere around 1.5k of their most battleworthy men. Ofcourse Kiev claimed they only lost 100 men in the ilovaisk disaster. They are very good at covering up their losses.\n\nDuring the Debaltsevo encirclement, the militia managed to encircle Debaltsevo and Kiev troops eventually ran out of ammunition. The troops stationed at Debaltsevo were forced to retreat under heavy artillery fire. It is estimated by independent bloggers (who I find to be a lot more truthful than official sources) that Ukrainian Army took losses somewhere around 2-2.5k men killed during this operation, while the militia lost somewhere around 1k men killed. Again, the reason for the disparity in men killed is that the Kiev troops were under operation encirclement and forced to retreat under heavy artillery fire.\n\nAnyway, you can see my point that multiple thousands of people die in a single engagement.

Which of the two features is the essential one for "fiat money"?  From wikipedia \n\n> [ fiat money ] differs from commodity money and representative money. Commodity money is created from a good, often a precious metal such as gold or silver, which has uses other than as a medium of exchange (such a good is called a commodity), while representative money simply represents a claim on a such a good. [ ... ] While gold- or silver-backed representative money entails the legal requirement that the **bank of issue** redeem it in fixed weights of gold or silver, fiat money\'s value is unrelated to the value of any physical quantity.  [ ... ] In monetary economics, fiat money is an intrinsically useless object or record that is widely accepted as a means of payment.\n\nSince commodity money and representative money can also be issued by governments (e.g. as gold coins and as gold-backed paper money), the word "fiat" in "fiat money" clearly means "without any backing asset", and  not "issued by a government".\n\nBy the way, the term "fiat money" is not commonly used; the common word for that concept is just "money".  Outside monetary theory, "fiat money" or just "fiat" was mostly used disparagingly by "gold peddlers" to convince people to invest in gold and precious metals instead of bonds, cash, or other currency-denominated instruments.  It seems that many early bitcoiners were also "gold bugs", so they borrowed the term "fiat money" for ordinary money with the same purpose, namely to disparage it.

They refer to how much more computational effort will be needed to keep the bitcoin system running, as the number of users "n" increases in the future.  Unfortunately I don\'t know how to explain that in "3 sentences or less", unless they are *very long* sentences. ;-)\n\nSince computational effort means cost, and (in general) the cost of the system must be eventually paid by the users, that question is basically how much each user wil have to pay as the system gets more users.\n\nIdeally, in a payment system, the computational effort for each user should stay the same, or at most grow very slowly as "n" inceases.  Even if the system gets 10 times more users in some period, it should still cost about the same for each user.  In (pseudo) mathematics jargon, that would be expressed as "the system has total cost O(n)" [ = "proportional no n" ], or "cost O(1) [ = "constant" ] per user".\n\nBitcoin has a problem there, because all the transactions in the world are recorded in the same file, the blockchain; and every client who wants to be really safe (a so-called "full client") should download the whole blockchain and check that it is valid.  But the number of transactions issued per day will increase in proportion to the number of users n, and so the amount of data that *each* full client must download and check per day also increases in proportion to n. \n\nThat is, if next year the number of bitcoin users were to increas 10 times, the cost for each full client, per day, would be 10 times higher too: he would have to download 10 times as much blockchain data, and spend 10 times as much computing effort to check it.  In that same pseudomath jargon, one says that "the cost for each full client is O(n)", rather than O(1).  If all clients were full nodes, the total cost to them would be O(n^2), rather than O(n).  \n\nThat is obviously bad, so it is assumed that most clients will not be "full clients" but only "SPV clients", that basically trust that the blockchain maintained by someone else is correct. For each SPV client, the cost will be basically O(1).  \n\nHowever, in order to serve those "n" SPV clients, there still need to exist a sufficient number of full clients that, in addition to downloading and validating the whole blockchain, will also answer queries from the SPV clients.  Each of those so-called "full relay nodes" will still have to do "O(n)" work per day just to keep their copy of the blockchain up-to-date.  If there are "m" full relay nodes, the total work made by the SPV clients per day will be O(n), while the total work of the full nodes, per day, would be O(m x n).\n\nIf the number "m" of full relay nodes stays the same -- say, 3000 -- as the number "n" of users increases, each full node will also have to serve an increasing number of SPV clients.  Even so, if next year adoption were to grow by a factor of 10, the daily cost for each full node would be 10 times higher, and the total cost of the system would grow only by a factor of 10.  So the cost per user would still be roughly the same.\n\nHowever, full nodes do not get any reward for their services; they are supposed to do that out of love for bitcoin, or because they are businesses that profit from bitcoin in other ways.  Therefore, a typical full node may not be able or willing to download 10 times more blockchain data and serve 10 times more SPV clients.  While the computing cost per se would not be great, the bandwidth needed to do that may soon be prohibitive. \n\nThus, in order to serve 10 times more clients, the number of full nodes would ideally have to increase 10 times, too.  How to do that is a big unsolved problem; in fact, the number of full relay nodes has been decreasing over the years.  But even if it were possible to achieve that goal -- that is, have "m" grow porortionally to "n", or m = O(n) -- the daily cost per full node would still be O(n), and the total cost of the system would be O(m x n) = O(n^2); and then the cost per user would be O(n).  \n\nIn other words, if bitcoin were to get 10 times as many users, and somehow gained 10 times as many full nodes, and the cost of the system had to be split among all users,  each user would have to pay 10 times more, somehow.\n\nBut that is very unlikely to happen.  On the contrary, if bitcoin\'s user base were to grow to a hundred million users anytime soon, the independent full relay nodes will probably disappear, because they would not be willing to bear 100x or 1000x more work and internet bandwidth for nothing.  Only the miners, who need that service in order to work, may still run full node services; but that may require raising the transaction fees to a level that pays for their full-node services (that may cost pennies per transaction, paid by the users), if not for the mining itself (that now costs ~8 USD per transaction, to be paid by new bitcoin investors).': 6, 'mmm, that must be it.': -5, 'On the order of n = do something n times.

So it\'s an objective measure since it\'s based on mathematical analysis of the algorithm.\n\nI suppose you could describe the complexity of a problem by its best known solution, eg. "comparison-based sorting is an O(n * logn) problem".  In some cases, a lower bound is proven (as with sorting), and in some other cases, it\'s not yet proven whether a more efficient solution might exist.': 6, 'Generally, big O notation means "how many computer instructions are necessary for a computer to find the answer to a given problem", where n is the number of inputs.  It\'s commonly used to show how fast a computer can sort a list (if I give you 100 numbers, how many times do you have to loop through the list to sort them?  One loop is O (n), one loop with one loop inside is O (n^2 ), one loop with one loop inside with one loop inside *that* is O(n^3 ), etc).  Basically, the bigger the number, the harder a problem is.  In the case of network growth, it\'s not really an appropriate metric, but usually people mean to show how fast the network is growing.  Bigger n, faster growth.\n\nEdit: number of *nested* loops': 1, "Big O notation is a way to describe **how long something takes to do relative to the amount of things that are required to do it.** \n\nThe 'N' part is the function of the number of things required, which could be linear like O(N) or exponential like O(N^2). \n \nThink about being asked to count to N=10 vs count to N=100. Assuming you don't speed up when counting the second time, you should increase by a factor of 10. Meaning the time complexity is linear relative to the input size N.\n\nConsider someone asks you to count in a more shitty way, instead of counting directly to 10, you count to 1, then 2, then 3, ... till N = 10. (e.g. 1, 1-2, 1-2-3, 1-2-3-4, and so on). In this counting method, N=10 certainly takes WAY less time than N=100. So this isn't linear O(N) like the example before, it's exponential O(N^2).": -1, 'if trolling behavior earns you a 2 week ban, do you create an alt account to make a sound?': 4, "It's actually a great explanation and I suspect you just don't understand complexity.
