That way, the UTXOs with the highest reward-to-cost ratio for attackers and the highest risk to Bitcoin would be deleted right away, buying extra time for the vast majority of people who have far-lower-value UTXOs.\n\n(BTW, although you often hear about minuscule quantum computers being built in labs, most experts think that a quantum computer large enough to attack Bitcoin keys won't exist for at least 10-20 years.)": 0, "If he had ample notice to move and didn't move, we should assume he no longer has access.\n\nIt is not in his hands if they're left there.

With this, old UTXOs can be completely deleted except for an entry in a hash tree, but they can still be spent by providing about half a KB of extra data per UTXO being spent. For the end-user, the result is that particularly old UTXOs need a somewhat higher fee to spend. For nodes, the result is that the UTXO set's size will be limited to some exact size, and will not grow unbounded. (Limiting the UTXO set to some exact size is not part of jl2012's proposal, but it can be done, and I think it'd make more sense.)\n\nDeleting old UTXOs also helps with scaling in other areas than just the UTXO set size, so I was also thinking of the various other good scaling proposals, such as UTXO commitments, syncing backwards, sharding historical block storage, etc.": 1, 'Nice!': 2, 'That\'s probably the strongest argument against it, but I don\'t really see much of a slippery slope.

If you expire UTXOs after a year or whatever, it limits the size of the UTXO set and also allows for several other nice optimizations. I (and others) were talking about this as early as 2011, and some altcoins have implemented versions of the idea. Later on, far better scaling technologies were developed which put this concept (often called "demurrage" in the Bitcoin universe, though it\'s very different from this word\'s usual meaning outside of Bitcoin) out of fashion.

Maybe a few very-early merchants used this instead of having a unique address per transaction.\n\nPay-to-IP was removed around 0.5, I think.\n\nAlso (and more importantly), the built-in solo miner would always pay directly to a public key, so there\'s over a million unspent bitcoins in the form of 50-BTC subsidies directly to public keys.

Everyone would be urged to send all of their bitcoins to new OP_LAMPORT-protected addresses.\n* One softfork set to trigger in 5 years would convert OP_CHECKSIG to OP_RETURN, destroying all coins protected by OP_CHECKSIG. People would have until then to move their BTC to secure addresses. Anyone who fails to do so would almost certainly have lost their money due to the ECDSA failure anyway -- the number of people who lose *additional* BTC would be very low.

People never joined Bitcoin that coins would be lost at any particular rate, or that they'd actually know what that rate would be. Surely people have assumed some coins thought lost would be recovered and recirculated, how can this be said to be too much?
