One of the questions/problems they were trying to address is why Bitcoin has not been more widely adopted thus far. \n\nThere is a lot of good literature on how to introduce new currencies, but one of the biggest problems has always been to get the currency as widely distributed as possible. The Greeks almost had to deal with this problem last year when they almost exited the Euro. \n\n[From the Coursera Princeton Bitcoin course](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/bitcointech/readings/chapter_0.pdf)\n> . A cash-based system needs to be \xe2\x80\x9cbootstrapped\xe2\x80\x9d with some initial allocation of cash, without which no trades can occur.\n\nOne of the key criticisms about 21 Bitcoin Computer is that it would have been easier and cheaper for people to just buy their own Bitcoin.\n\nTrue, but after 7 years, Bitcoin has not yet penetrated to the masses who could have all bought 100 satoshis each.\n\nIn fact, [Balaji even proposed giving Bitcoin away for free](https://www.trybtc.com/), but the adoption rate was still super low.\n\nThe other problem with selling Bitcoin to people, ala Coinbase, is the KYC requirements. As soon as you are exchanging fiat currency with Bitcoin, you run into the financial regulatory system, and the costs of compliance make satoshi amounts of purchases inconvenient. \n\nSo we can safely say that there is little hope that 100 million people decide to pay 10 cents each to buy thirty thousand satoshis from an exchange.\n\nThere is even little hope that if you were giving away 10 cents worth of satoshi's for free, 100 million people will sign up on a wallet service to receive them. \n\nThe integrated miner chip is really a kind of legal hack.

On the 21BC it runs at 50, but probably in the 21 server farm with mineral oil coolant it runs at 125\n* So, 25 million / 125 = 200,000 chips already in existence\n* Given they have 200k chips already built, an additional 20k for the 21BC probably costs about $10 \n\n**So total cost is about $50 for the 21BC**\n**Selling at $400, they make $350 margin or about 87.5% margin**\n\n": -1, "I've been trying to guess at this one for a while.

And that's for a consumer gaming device, which probably has a market of 1 million devs.\n\nThis is going to be much more enterprise driven, so I would guess Qualcomm, Cisco, HP, plus banks interested in the blockchain are going to get their hands on units.\n\nMy best guess is that they will sell about 20k units over the course of 12 months.": 1, ">This company has a long game plan and plenty of financing.\n\nSo why charge such an enormous markup? \n\n> sell a ton at a low price point \n\nWhy do you consider $400 a low price point? $100 would be low and borderline profitable\n\n>only to burn their reputation.\n\nTheir reputation kickstarted by a $350 markup on a $50 device? \n\n>At $400 the people who buy it have bought into their vision and are far less likely to be harsh critics...\n\nAre you saying people who haven't wasted $350 but can accomplish all the same things don't have valid criticisms?\n": 0, 'I bought one.': 6}, ('Introducing the Shift Card.

Search and Google are your friends.': 2, '> have you considered that if there is any of those three things:  Overwhelming node connectivity, collaborating with miners, or being the miners - that bitcoin already has much worse problems than quantum computers?\n\nNot really. Overwhelming node connectivity enables denial of service, selective hiding of transactions, and double-spend if and only if you accept unconfirmed transactions. It does not allow stealing your money or spoofing well-confirmed transactions.\n\nMisbehaving miners that (together) have significantly below 50% are not a major problem. They can\'t effectively deny transactions since others can and will mine them, they can\'t spoof a well-confirmed transaction, they can\'t steal your money, ...\n\nMiners did enable various variants of RBF which caused minor problems for zero-confirmation transactions, but that\'s about the extent of risks I can see.\n\nIndeed, some corrections would be possible using friendly forks of the blockchain assuming 51% of mining power agrees, but that\'s not the idea behind Bitcoin.\n\nI think that if that was the only thing keeping Bitcoin secure while quantum computer became "widespread" (i.e. known to be in the hands of a few companies), just the possibility of an attack would be enough to destroy trust and thus adoption and value.\n\nAlso, a possible realistic hard-to-prevent attack is a large company having a quantum computer, and an employee or intern with access to it running a small script written at night against one or multiple of [the super-rich addresses that have their pubkey exposed](https://bitinfocharts.com/top-100-richest-bitcoin-addresses.html). If you think that\'s unrealistic, you don\'t want to know what kind of things people run on supercomputer clusters under the guise of "maintenance burn-in tests". This requires no malicious miners or anything and couldn\'t be reverted unless we explicitly decided to throw away the "key holder owns the coins" maxime. While the number of exposed coins will likely go significantly down if this becomes a risk, I suspect that Satoshi\'s coins alone (often mined into unhashed pay-to-pubkey outputs!) would be enough to cause major economic problems when stolen. Unless these coins are moved or voided, they *will* be up for grabs to the first person who uses a quantum computer on them - which is just a question of time.': 0, 'The first two results on Google for "bitcoin quantum computer" are [this](http://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/6062/what-effects-would-a-scalable-quantum-computer-have-on-bitcoin) and [this](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/bitcoin-is-not-quantum-safe-and-how-we-can-fix-1375242150). Both seem to agree that Bitcoin as is would be more or less fucked. Which is a problem because unless we explicitly wipe out all coins stored in a non-quantum-safe way (i.e. in addresses for which the public keys are available), someone will likely get enough "forgotten/lost" coins to cause economic disruption.\n\nThe second link proposes Lamport Signatures. The problem with those is that they require public keys to be single-use (which is actually something Bitcoin could deal with, sort of), and they require them to consist of 320 160-bit hashes even if you\'re willing to accept that security level. That\'s 51200 bit or 6.4 KB per pubkey-and-signature. We\'re gonna need a bigger block...': 0, 'I appreciate where you are coming from, but have you considered that if there is any of those three things: Overwhelming node connectivity, collaborating with miners, or being the miners - that bitcoin already has much worse problems than quantum computers? I agree that if those three things happen the entire decentralized security model is broken. The thing is they aren\'t going to magically just happen. In fact their likelihood of coming to unmitigated fruition is incredibly small.\n\nHowever since they are remote possibilities lets examine them. There are many incentive models in play including attacks on pools that grow more effective as the pool also grows which inherently disincentive the uncontrolled centralization of miners. If miners somehow managed to collaborate in a destructive way, or if a hostile entity ever became the dominant miner of bitcoin then we have some very nice options. For example, we know any hostile miner of 51%< hash power is going to double spend on blocks they mine. As soon as such happens, protocol malleability is what will save us. We, the remaining developers and miners not hostile to the network, are able to effectively ignore any blocks coming from this new mining powerhouse - forking the network and isolating the hostile entity. Obviously such an attack would cause issues for the network in forking efficiently but those would be the limits of the disaster. Any "victims" would return to the fork chain to find their coins intact, while the perpetrator of the attack would have spent an immense amount of money on hardware that is now running a private sidechain with 100% of the hashrate.\n\nSo lets just be clear, there are existing pressures in place to combat these situations occurring - financial incentives including risks of enormous losses in hardware and opportunity costs of not mining on the blockchain honestly, malicious pressures including hostile miners attacking pools, and peer pressures including the outrage coming from people like you.\n\nFinally, if the unthinkable occurs and any of the non-quantum things you discuss happened despite these pressures we still have protocol malleability. Protocol malleability is what will define the decentralized security model - the ability to react to and exclude threats.\n\nThese concerns are all unrelated to quantum computing however.

That's the worst case, protocol unmalleable situation and it's not the end of the world. Fortunately we have the option to move the bitcoin protocol to a quantum resistant algorithm at our leisure as our protocol is quite malleable.\n\nSo what I am saying is your alarm is largely misplaced. The scenario you describe can be avoided entirely with the protocol rules and algorithms in place as is, let alone our ability to change the protocol rules.": 1, "Not true. As soon as you attempt to use an address, your key is exposed and can be broken using quantum computing. After that, the cryptographic protections are gone. An attacker with privileged network access may isolate your node, intercept your tx before it reaches the network, then break your key and broadcast his tx. Even if you do manage to get your tx out first, it's up to the miner mining the next block whether they honor your tx or the attacker's (assuming the attacker can break it before the block is mined, which is a reasonable assumtion). The attacker can influence that decision by offering a significantly higher reward.": -1}}}
