But would you really move your entire net worth onto Bitcoin, not today, and at what expense will the  insured bitcoin accounts be, when the Government offers FDIC insurance for FREE.

You could have a Bitcoin Based Credit card.  But it would probably be more expensive, then a real credit card since they would not make money of merchants but of you as loan with all kinds of fees. More like a cash advance.  Also, there is no need for a merchant processing network, so no reward points or perks.

It's meant to be a SECOND form of authentication such that you need 2 forms to authenticate and login.\n\nLook at how many reports there are with people who lost their phones and can never get into accounts again. That's the kind of user unfriendliness that will make people shy away from Google Authenticator or 2FA in general. This is the same problem with Bitcoin. If you make security and usability consistently hard for average users to grasp, then its going to be hard to take off. I think of myself as generally tech-capable considering I've done Android development, and while getting into the nitty gritty of Bitcoin is possible for me, I'd rather not have to go through all that just to understand how to properly secure my funds. Your average Joe doesn't want to figure out how to backup authenticator codes either.\n\nFor now I'd recommend people to use Authy. Sure its a cloud backup system that could be insecure, but they claim its locally decrypted. Plus you need to confirm either via SMS or eMail or a second device (If you enable multi device) to add a new device to the account. And only then can you download the encrypted blob which you must decrypt locally.

However, for peace of mind, they use their 2nd key to pre-sign an nlocktime transaction that spends the money back to an address under your control after a certain time. This allows them to have veto power over your spending in the short term, but gives you the power to eventually recover the money if they ever stop signing (as with this case where they won't sign because he can't prove his 2nd factor).

I dismissed it back then but I can see that it could serve a valuable purpose, but it would be a double edged sword. I personally have lost my RES settings twice over the years and lost valuable tagging info so flair is not altogether a bad idea as long as mods don\'t hand out flair like candy and try to be impartial and thorough to avoid abuse. I think it would help new users and give trolls less opportunity to manipulate or distort discussions. If you want to reduce abuse, spam and disruptive trolling, flairs is not an entirely bad idea, and could clean up discussions a great deal.\n\nI think it would be great to weed out disruptive users and make things easier for company reps, but I can almost guarantee it is going to give the mods more work, and there will be drama if the mods aren\'t super careful. The mods are going to put themselves in a position where they can be possibly manipulated, and they are going to act with bias if they aren\'t careful. I\'d avoid giving titles like "Bitcoin core dev" because lets be honest, that is nebulous and bitcoin core devs can come and go, meaning mods will need to keep track of it, not to mention that mods can be biased, and it excludes other projects that are just as deserving. Instead a more general title like "Prominent Bitcoin Developer", or "Bitcoin Developer - [Project Name]" or something along those lines is far more inclusive of other Bitcoin projects and doesn\'t show preference or deference to one group over another.\n\nI think having flair for early users would be sweet (I\'m personally biased in this case though as I am one ;) ), but mods need to be aware that they are going to have to go to the effort to be rigorous and not show bias again. If any kind of flair is used, it should be general in some way, maybe defined as "Early User - 20xx", who can prove forum membership or contribution, or "Early Adopter/Miner - 20xx" for miners or people that would like to claim they mined a block back in the day. [2010]\'ers, or early forum users should be able to prove they are old users either via account history, or even better if they are an early Bitcoin user from 2010, and they want to prove they were, or want to claim "I mined a block back in the day!", simply sign a message that can be verified on the blockchain to prove you were an early user ;). It may take more than that though as even then, it could be manipulated, it may require a combination of an old account and old address/mined block to avoid shenanigans.\n\nFlair for companies should be very rigorous as it will be exploited by scammers trying to put on an air of legitimacy via this sub, maybe prefacing it with "Company Rep - XYZ", as well as a disclaimer in the sidebar so that users are aware that the mods don\'t specifically endorse any company, just that they recognise that the account is used by the representative of that company\n\nSo, personally, I think it is a net positive idea, but I think mods need to accept the fact that they are going to have to be super rigorous and need to make sure they are not injecting bias, or open themselves to manipulation by scammers hoping to give an air of legitimacy to their scams. It is going to be a lot of work for you guys (the mods) so I hope that if they do go ahead with something like this they try to be as impartial and rigorous as possible.': 1, 'We won\'t be tagging people as shills, and if you think "working for someone" is the same as "being a paid shill for someone", pretty much everyone here is "a shill".\n\nAt the moment we intend the flairs to be opt-in - anyone working for a company will be able to verify themselves to be able to represent that company.

BTCX is being either dishonest or just ignorant about the implications of turning over such data. No doubt can they obfuscate the IDs and bitcoin address information so that skatteverket is unable to chart their users.

If you dont hand it over the Skatteverket is in their rights to break an entry and grab whatever documents they want to.\n\nFor non bitcoin businesses it stops right there. By reviewing the audited company\'s bank statement they can never find out what transactions the end customer have done from their own bank account. With bitcoin this is different, by knowing the Bitcoin addresses the Skatteverket is able to review all our customers transactions, as well as our own. That is, of course, not acceptable.\n\nAnd if we really have tried to come up with other solutions? Of course we have. We have spent quite an insane amount of time on censoring documents, anonymizing records and stripping out Bitcoin addresses.

This puts me in contact with a lot of musicians (the last time I put the call out I received over 7000 submissions).  With that kind of access to artists, I have started looking at other opportunities for them.  I set up a bundle sale for some artists on Groupees and am currently working on getting artists onto Twitch.\n\nBitcoin sounds like a potential opportunity for these artists.  Possibly setting up bundles of music that can be purchased with bitcoin, and I like the tip ideas you suggested.  I just have to think of the best way to present it to artists and also how to utilize the collective strength of getting a bunch of artists together.  Thank you for the reply and info.': 1, 'I hope the other artists are as excited about Bitcoin as Shooter Jennings. He really gets it.
