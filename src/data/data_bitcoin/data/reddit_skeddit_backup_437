Sounds like something to explore more thoroughly to me. ": 1, 'It depends on the type of phone you have, the balances you have or plan to keep, whether or not and the ways you plan to spend BTC and how paranoid you are about having your BTC stolen. \n\nI, too, have an Android and I love Mycelium. We\'ve heard from numerous people that BreadWallet is the way to go on iOS. Both are great for "walking around money", whatever that number is for you -- it\'s different for everyone. Both are very safe, and the nightmare stories we hear around here never involve them. \n\nSome people prefer to maintain their balances on a PC. In that case, the most highly recommended client is Electrum. Many people are still reading older tutorials that direct them to install Bitcoin Core. That is the original client and it includes certain extra functionality that plays a key role in improving the capacity and safety and security of Bitcoin as a whole. Unfortunately, that client is not written with the new end user in mind, and unless you make associated changes to your network configuration at home, you\'re actually harming the Bitcoin ecosystem instead of helping it. \n\nThere is also another class of wallets: hardware wallets. Trezor and the Ledger product lines are the heavy hitters here. They are devices that are designed to protect your private keys at all costs, even to the point of never letting you see them. If you can\'t get to your keys, then hackers can\'t either. They take very similar approaches to solving the problem, but with some key differences.\n\nThe Trezor has a built in screen, enabling you to verify when you try to spend your BTC that it is going to the correct address. The Ledger devices are too small for a screen, so they use your phone\'s display for confirming transactions. The Ledger devices are small enough to fit on your keychain and require a Chrome browser to use. You can always have your balances secure and in your possession at all times. \n\nThe Trezor uses open source software from top to bottom, while the Ledger devices use the smartchip that has been used to protect financial transactions around the world for decades now. That chip is just starting to show up on bank cards in the USA. That smartchip is proprietary, so Ledger has only been able to open source the content outside of the secure element. In order to spend BTC from either device, you must attach it to your PCs USB port and visit a website. Each product\'s associated website knows how to interact with the device and request a transaction. The transaction is constructed on the device and handed back to the PC for transmission onto the Bitcoin network. You may also attach them to cellphones, but that is a fringe use case right now.\n\nFinally, if you have very high balances and/or consider yourself fairly paranoid about the safety of your balances, there is another interesting approach. Most Bitcoin is stolen when people leave their balances on web based wallets (not websites associated with hardware wallets described above). Some victims also leave remote control software on their PC where they also manage their balances. The alternate approach below is unique in that the details for managing your balances don\'t exist anywhere on Earth except during the few minutes at a time where you are actually moving BTC around. \n\nCheck out the Tails OS. It is a specialized version of Linux that is designed to protect your privacy and maintain secrecy around all of your online activity. If you configure it to boot from USB or CD and not store any data from your sessions anywhere, then all data created during each session is destroyed when you shut down and reboot your computer back into its regular operating system. \n\nThis is significant because all of your Bitcoin balances are stored on thousands of computers around the world, not on your actual PC. The only thing you\'re storing locally are the keys enabling you to spend your BTC. When you pair that fact up with the fact that all modern clients use word lists to generate millions of Bitcoin addresses and that Electrum is included with Tails, you have something special.\n\nIf you can memorize 12 common words in an exact sequence, then you can boot up your PC off Tails, type in those 12 words, and establish full control of your balances. When you shut down and reboot into your regular OS, there is zero indication left behind on your PC about what you did to manage your BTC. There\'s no website to hack, no software on your PC that is trying to protect sensitive data, no histories in your browser that indicates what site you use to manage your balances. Nothing. \n\nAs for me, I\'m in the USA. It is important to keep track of how much you spent when buying BTC, whether or not it increased in value while you held it, and if it did increase in value while you held it, how long you held it. All of that detail goes into calculating whether or not and how much tax you owe when acquiring and spending BTC. I setup a new wallet each time I buy BTC. I name it with the date and exchange rate. Mycelium handles multiple wallets beautifully. The only downside is that all of the wallet names and notes on every transaction are lost if I lose my phone or wipe it. Airbitz is another wallet that restores all that detail when you restore after a wipe or moving to another device, but that convenience actually makes me nervous. \n\nI also have a tiny balance on a Ledger Nano. The Ledger devices don\'t natively support multiple wallets simultaneously, so I could only trust it with one huge balance purchased at one time, which isn\'t my typical approach. Finally, I also have a tiny balance on Tails with a memorized Electrum key. Electrum does support working with multiple wallets, but that would involve (possibly) memorizing and typing in multiple 12 word lists each time I want to move some BTC around. Like the Ledger products, that is a great way to manage one huge balance purchased at one time if you want to make life easier for you at tax time. \n\ntl;dr Mycelium on my phone, Ledger Nano on my keychain, and a 12 word list for Electrum on Tails in my head.

I spend some time on history, because a lot of people don't think about how the US dollar got to where it is today. I walk people through the payment system and emphasize the critical importance of safeguarding one's wallet seed. I define what an internet protocol is and compare Bitcoin to HTTP and its current state to the early days of the internet. I also discuss in broad strokes what the blockchain is, how the mining process works, how important the concept of distributed consensus is, and the importance of all this being open-source. It's a lot of information to throw at people in an hour, especially if they are not technically-minded. But so far, the feedback I've gotten has been really good.

As you develop a processing history with Payza, these fees can be lowered.\n\nFor standard businesses, the receiving fees for payments (either by Bitcoin or by e-wallet) is 2.50%+$0.25, that's pretty competitive. Right now, all Bitcoin payments you receive through Payza would be credited to your Payza account in the fiat currency of your choice. You would then be able to withdraw those funds using one of our convenient withdrawal options. If you choose to withdraw by Bitcoin, the spread is 2% over our exchange rate, calculated in real time.\n\nEventually we plan on giving merchants the option to keep some or all of the Bitcoin payments they receive in Bitcoin, I don't know yet what the pricing for that would be, but it would probably be in line with the 2.50%+$0.25 receiving fee.": 2, "I don't know if that applies here.

Payza reminds me of Paycoin Garza': 1, 'So here\'s a bit of clarification:\n\n> Do I need a separate merchant account, or are credit card payments processed directly through your company at the fees listed below? If payments are processed directly through you, am I correct in assuming that incoming credit card payments are billed at 4.99 % + $ 0.59 receiving fee as indicated at the bottom asterisk of the fees page?\n\nWith a Payza Business Account you will have the option to directly process credit card payments at 4.99% +$0.59 and your payments will be sent directly to your Payza account, no merchant account would be necessary. These are known as Balance Top Up or Auto-Load payments. Essentially, your customer would be topping up his or her Payza account and using those funds to make payment, but we streamlined the process down to one step for convenience.\n\nI should note, right now this only works with Visa brand cards, but we\'re working on getting support for other credit card companies as well. Once the funds are in your Payza account, you can withdraw them at any time using one of our convenient withdrawal options. \n\nMore info about direct credit card payments can be found on our blog, the default option for these types of payments is OFF and it is up to merchants to switch it on (see: "Opting in to receive auto-load payments"): https://blog.payza.com/payza-updates/announcements/introducing-top-up-feature/\n\nTop Up/Auto-Load payments have higher fees because the credit card deposit fee is passed on to the merchant or receiver in these cases, the customer pays no fees (standard credit card deposit fees are 3.50%). With direct Credit Card Payments, instead of Payza receiving 6% + $0.25 split between the buyer and the seller, we receive 4.99% + $0.59. For lower amounts this does work in our favor, but in most cases it doesn\'t (actually the buyer is the biggest winner here, they get a quicker, simpler option and aren\'t subject to fees).\n\n> For accepting Bitcoin payments, it looks like payments go to a wallet that Payza controls. Are users charged both the 2.50 % + $0.25 USD when accepting payments via Bitcoin, and then an additional 2% fee for withdrawing to a personal wallet (for a total of 4.5% + $0.25)?\n\nThat\'s not entirely correct actually, but it is somewhat right. Bitcoin payments are treated as e-wallet payments, you are only charged the 2.50% + $0.25 fee for  receiving either of these payments. So, if you have a $20 item, if a member pays you directly with available funds in the Payza account, or if they pay you by Bitcoin, in both cases you would receive $19.25 to your Payza balance. This includes funds added to that members account by credit card and then sent to you by e-wallet payment. Right now you only have the option to receive Bitcoin payments in fiat currency, we are looking into giving merchants the option to keep some or all of these payments in Bitcoin.\n\nOnce the funds are in your account, you would have the option to withdraw them however you like, this includes our Bitcoin Withdrawal option. If you choose that option, your withdrawal would be subject to the 2% spread on our exchange rates. If you chose to withdraw by Bank Transfer (where available), your withdrawal would only cost $0.50.\n\nSorry if that explanation was a bit long-winded, please let me know if there\'s anything that wasn\'t clear or if you had any other questions.': 5, 'Thanks a lot - I really appreciate the detailed response.\n\n': 4, "Hello!\n\nI commission a lot of artists for drawn adult fetish art.

Mexico sends $1B/yr to the US. The US sends $25B/yr to Mexico. Suppose Bitcoin takes over that entire market. That creates a net $24B/yr BTC->MXN sell pressure, and an equivalent USD->BTC buy pressure. So Bitcoin wants to go moon in the US, but wants to go core in Mexico. That means the Bitcoin exchange rate becomes increasingly unfavorable for remittances. Either it becomes prohibitively expensive to send remittances via Bitcoin and the market grinds to a halt, or the market rebalances as people take advantage of arbitrage by converting USD to pesos and wiring those pesos to Mexico over the traditional banking network, then buying Bitcoins from Mexican sellers and reselling them in the US.

Do you think it is at least possible that our current system, while clearly imperfect, may turn out to be superior to a deflationary currency?\n\nWe always have to wait and see.  No one can predict the future, and economic variables cannot all be known and controlled for.  But we can know certain things, before they are observed empirically; such as the laws of supply and demand and other economic phenomena.  We can know with relative surety that, ceteris paribus (all other things equal), voluntarily organized systems deliver more value, and do not distort mutually beneficial exchange.  Note that that doesn\'t mean that we necessarily observe clear advantages with one or the other. . . because their is no running economic experiments in petri dishes, side by side.  If you take a presently undeveloped country, and made it extremely economically free, and then took a developed country and imposed massive economic controls (for the children of course). . . I would still bet on the developed country coming out ahead in all sorts of important metrics for a good long while.  Minimum wage laws put downward pressure on employment (a priori); but if you removed minimum wage laws from a backwards or stagnant part of the U.S. and then imposed high minimum wages (like say $20/hr) in some burgeoning tech market of the U.S. . . . I\'d still bet on the burgeoning tech market (the Seattle or the Silicon Valley) to produce higher employment numbers and growth, than the place that got rid of minimum wage. . . for a good long while.  The real question is always, how much better could the world\'s monetary system have been if all variables had remained the same except the existence of Bitcoin/gold/hard asset in place of central banks?  How much more employment could there have been in Seattle, if not for the minimum wage.  We can\'t look back at history and say that people were just stupid, or if they had this regulation, or that social safety net, or this monetary policy, that they would have been so much better off.  We can\'t look back and confuse modernity and technology for enlightenment or better government or the triumph of mixed economies.  For the same reasons why you can\'t just outlaw child labor in Bangladesh (guess where the kids all go: prostitution and starvation) and imagine that makes things better.  In the U.S., child labor ended because we grew wealthy enough to, not only care about the problem, but to end it.  National level legislation came after child labor was already nearly ended and most kids were attending school.  You can\'t look at immature markets and their volatility and their lack of discipline and regulation. . . and imagine that government systems weren\'t given the chance, over decades, to learn from many many mistakes and failures and evolve into the comprehensive systems they are now.  We have been trained to apply a nirvana fallacy to government. . . but not give markets the benefit of the doubt and the requisite time to develop similar discipline.\n\nThere are so many factors and forces in play in an economy; you can\'t just look at statistics or historical data, and expect there to be one reasonable, rational conclusion based solely on looking at that evidence, so . . . .\n\n>It seems to me that there is not enough historical precedent to accurately predict how things would be if bitcoin became globally adopted.\n\nSee above.  Your worries are borne of a fear which our culture and society and schools (to some extent) inculcate in us:  this need to feel in control of complex systems which are inescapably out of human control (at least out of control of any single entity or intentional groups).  To feel like there\'s a plan, that you can grasp.\n\nYou need to learn how markets function.  You need to understand what value is, and why we can reasonably expect markets to produce better results than central control.  You need to understand the calculation problem.  You need to understand what mechanisms markets have to produce public goods, and get around transaction costs, and internalize externalities, and you need to understand why current monetary policy and state/central bank control is detrimental and not just "imperfect" or needing of a few tweaks.  You need to understand why it is fundamentally flawed and how it has created massive distortions (along with government interventions of other kinds) all over the economy, which have created the outcomes and the phenomena which people like you observe and blame on "capitalism" or free markets; when nothing of the sort has been allowed to function.\n\nThere is no evidence to clearly suggest one way or the other. . . but there is understanding of economic laws, markets, and complex system which teaches us to chill out and just rationally pursue our self-interested and selfless aims, and let the incomprehensibly complex societal memory and information network, called *prices* to guide our actions, into an emergent whole which creates the highest net value we as humans can achieve given our present circumstances.': 3, 'A deflation with fiat currency is terrifying.\n\nYou need inflation with FIAT currency because the money supply need to increase to pay the interest on debt.\nMoney is created out of debt (fractional reserve..) you always have more debt compare to money available at in any given time.\nYou need inflation to catch up on that.\nIf you end up in a deflation you decrease the money supply then you increase the number of default which further decrease the money supply and the number of default... the "house of card" is falling.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqvKjsIxT_8\n\nIn a bitcoin or gold standart currency the mechanic is different.\nYou are not in a debt-based society.': 3, '>1.

My view is that if you\'re trying to model anything in economics, it had better be an exceptionally narrow piece of it, with well understood forces, using solid micro-foundations.  Even then, you\'re setting yourself up for failure by trying to predict the future with it.  We cannot make assumptions with complex systems and we can\'t isolate the variables.\n\n>2.

I\'ve read General Theory and other mainstream macro texts.  I\'m pretty sure I understand them well enough to see the flaws in the arguments and the premise. Suffice it to say that no single comment I could post here is going to rebut what a large portion of the economics profession believes.   Keynes was not big on monetary stimulus anyway, favoring fiscal stimulus, with previously applied counter-cyclical spending/saving.  You gotta do your due diligence.  Once you\'re at least somewhat versed in Austrian business cycle theory and [capital-based macro](http://www.auburn.edu/~garriro/cbm.htm) ; I would suggest reading Rothbard\'s America\'s Great Depression, which is the most painstaking history of the Fed\'s activities before and during that time, and clearly exposes the fallacy in thinking that deflation was a cause of the prolonged downturn, rather than an effect of prior inflationary policy.\n\n>2. Inflation has an accelerating effect on our economy. *If you take away that 2-3% inflation or reduction of cash value you are directly taking away an incentive to consume and invest. \n\nDoes it? Probably it does stimulate demand in certain ways...but there\'s a purpose and an order to *what* the market demands and invests in, and when.  You can\'t just arbitrarily stimulate demand (even if you call it aggregate demand) and think that\'s the same as what the market would have ordered, and that there\'s no consequences....otherwise, you necessarily believe that we could just start making thousands of time more donuts today (we all love donuts right?) and divert resources from other areas of the economy (even those unemployed people and resources) and that magically we\'d be wealthier.  Because hey! GDP would have gone up, and we would have achieved full employment!  Just because stimulus tends to restructure the economy in less fanciful and extreme ways as I gave above, does not mean that it does not similarly hurt the economy, rather than help it...just possibly to a lesser degree than if we just diverted resources to donut-making.\nMore importantly, you have to question why resources and labor fell idle or underutilized in the first place, rather than assuming it as a structural feature.  Markets clear, if they are allowed to.  Keynes did not refute Say\'s law.\n\n>Consumption and investment being an fundamental aspects of economic growth.* \n\nWell sure! What else is there besides consumption and investment...I suppose if you define those narrowly enough, there\'s other things like "hoarding".  When you understand these things as processes in time, the distinctions become somewhat meaningless, and hoarding is just future investment and spending.  Now who knows best whether we need current or future goods more?\nLook, it\'s not rocket surgery and it\'s not magic: economic growth happens because we defer some present consumption or spending, in order to invest in higher orders of capital and lengthen the structure of production (e.g. Robinson Crusoe stops fishing by hand for one day, and goes without fish, in order to build a net. He can now catch more fish than he could before....yet his GDP had to go down for a while). \n\n>Just on the point of economic growth, people often get up-in-arms when you start talking about wanting economic growth. But I\'d like to point out how important past growth rates have been for the average world standard of living and the technological development that we have reaped. \n\nSure.  Show that that growth happened due to policy, and not in spite of it.  Good luck.  Or you can understand the meaning of growth and the mechanisms that create it, and clearly see that central planning is unlikely to have been able to be anything but dead-weight.\n\n': 1, 'http://i.imgur.com/xhkt8nC.jpg': 9, 'They can\xc2\xb4t print fiat at will: is this a problem?': -1, 'haha that might be the solution :)\n\nBut then you have to pay your debt!': 2, 'Good (adjective): Being positive or desirable in nature; not bad or poor:  a good experience; good news from the hospital. \n\n---\n^(I am a bot.

Unable to adjust the money supply directly, those countries resorted to other forms of debt and borrowing, which were badly mismanaged and resulted in spiraling debt with little economic gain. The inability of Eurozone members to control their money supply is one key reason (there are others) why the Eurozone recovery has lagged behind the US\'s recovery.\n\nNot sure what the lesson is there, other than "countries that can\'t set their own monetary policy are simply allowing someone else to set their policy for them," a problem which led to the universal global adoption of fiat currency.': 12, "The Greek debts are denominated mostly in Euros and Dollars.

If the bitcoin unit is adopted as that sort of asset, you can very well say that it would be hastening the crash, but also speeding the recovery and providing a hedge in the interim.\n\nMonetary deflation is bad, in a sense, for a fiat economy.  But, don\'t confuse slow, steady, progress-induced deflation for the phenomenon which we see in episodes like America\'s great depression.  For decades and centuries, gold and silver and other hard assets served as money (they became so without any government decrees or coinage and without central banks) and they were, most of the time deflationary.  \n\nGov\'ts had less direct control over the money supply, though that\'s not to say they had none, and they certainly had control over banking.  [See Rothbard\'s "History of Money and Banking in the United States"](https://mises.org/library/history-money-and-banking-united-states-colonial-era-world-war-ii) for a fairly exhaustive examination of what factors led to the infamous bank runs and panics of the "free banking" era.  (Hint: it had little to do with the gold standard itself).  As a simple falsification of that premise, all one has to do is look at Canada which differed critically only in its banking structure and regulations, yet enjoyed decades of stability under the gold standard.  \n\nSome of this flies in the face of what many schools of economics will teach or are willing to delve into, and the whole idea of deflationary money and  applicable periods in 19th century America are ignorantly and bluntly dismissed as dark times of "laissez-faire" capitalism and robber baron rule.  What they are usually smart enough not to do is deny that post- civil-war and pre-WWI America experienced some of the most sustained and drastic economic growth the world has ever seen...all under a gold standard, and generally deflationary environment.  It is also not conclusively shown that the pre-federal reserve recessions were any worse or more frequent than since the Fed.\n\nThere is no reason to suspect that a world using bitcoin as a reserve currency (and bitcoin even improves on gold in many ways) would suffer any negatives consequences directly due to bitcoin\'s (eventually) deflationary nature.\n\nMore importantly, markets have mechanisms with which to expand and contract the money supply (rationally; vs. the arbitrary and often political calculations of central banks).\n\nI\'m on mobile but PM me if you\'d like more citations, or further explanation.': 43, "So you're saying I wouldn't buy a new car every three years, a new computer every two years and a new phone every year?\n\nSounds like a shitty future if you ask me.
