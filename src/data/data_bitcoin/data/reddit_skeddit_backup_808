This is much "stickier" than a one-sided network and the reason that Craigslist specifically has been able to stick around for so long despite it\'s limited development, UI, etc. It\'s simply where buyers and sellers know where to find each other.\n\nBitcoin has an even stronger network effect. It\'s the cryptocurrency with the most users and accepting merchants and this dynamic is seen by the development community as well. This means that the vast majority of development in the cryptocurrency space is going into bitcoin. On top of that, the investor/VCs see that bitcoin is where the buyers, sellers, and developers are, so that\'s where they pour money into. You don\'t see many VC-backed litecoin/dogecoin operations for this reason.\n\nAny altcoin has to undo these effects. And given bitcoin\'s open-source nature, it\'s almost certainly easier to augment bitcoin with whatever desirable feature the altcoin brings forward, rather than try and bootstrap an entirely new coin.': 8, 'Its also the only reason litecoin is still going.

Ie.\n\n> For currency investors, the network effect is absolute because it is impossible to buy bitcoins and some altcoin with the same money. This is why analogies to other network effects, such as that between social networks like Facebook and G+, are spurious. It is possible to leverage the benefit of Facebook and G+ at the same time. I can, for example, write a single status update and then post it to both social networks at almost no additional cost.\n\n> Furthermore, there is very little long-term investment in the use of a social network. New status updates lose all value in hours. Message boards come and go. All it takes is to ignore Facebook for a few weeks before there is little to draw one back to it.

The Earth miners would have no hope of including this data since they would be so far away. But that introduces trust in a local source of random data into a system that should be trustless.\n\nTo build off that idea I suggest that the protocol itself can generate the random data based on transactions that are occurring on the network. But that might be problematic if there is ever a communication outage between cities on Mars. Marscoin would fork, and if each fork is accepting blocks that include random data based on the transactions in the network, it would be difficult to recombine the forks after the communication outage is over.

Counterparty uses Bitcoin as a timestamping system, which means the order of verification within the block is important. That means that a Counterparty transaction (e.g. asset transfer) may or may not be valid (as far as the Counterparty protocol is concerned) depending on the position at which it appears in the block relatively to other transactions.\n\nHere is an example:\n\nTransaction 1: A sends X to B\n\nTransaction 2: B sends X to C\n\nWith regular Bitcoin and Open Assets, you can't have Transaction 2 before Transaction 1 because that means you are spending an output that doesn't exist yet, and miners will find the transaction invalid.\n\nWith Counterparty, both transactions may appear valid to miners regardless of the order because Counterparty doesn't rely on outputs. But if the miner includes transaction 2 before transaction 1 in the block, then transaction 2 is not valid, and transaction 2 is effectively cancelled. Note that there was no double spend at all in that scenario.\n\nSince the order depends on the miner, you need to wait for the block before you can be sure the transaction will be accepted by the Counterparty protocol.\n\nFor more details, Mastercoin has detailed this behavior in [their blog](http://blog.mastercoin.org/2014/02/27/transaction-malleability-and-mastercoin/).": 9, 'Cool.

So I will explain in full detail why **alanX** is not welcome at the meetups anymore, and although he will try to dispute this, I luckily saved every single email that he ever sent to I and others to be able to prove what it is I am about to tell you and everyone else here. \n\nIn October of 2013 several of the members from the Austin Bitcoin Meetup decided to throw a Bitcoin conference, which we would call "The Texas Bitcoin Conference". However in order to do that, we needed a company to hold the money for the conference, so the "Texas Bitcoin Association" was started to handle the money for the conference.\n\nWhere did the money come to pay the attorneys fees to start the company? All of the money that was donated to the Austin Bitcoin Meetup was taken and spent on attorneys instead of being put back into the Austin Bitcoin Meetup as it was originally intended.\n\nWe had all originally agreed on a low price point for tickets, which was quickly inflated to $300-$350 per ticket. And our original price point for a venue skyrocketed when he insisted that the conference be held at the Circuit of Americas, and that a one day conference had to be a 2-day conference now.\n\nOver time it dawned on me why the conference was pushed to 2 days, because it just so happens that Mastercoin was funding the contests going on. In order to guarantee that would happen, $40k in Bitcoin was donated to the association in sponsorship money by them, however ...\n\n**alanX** claims that the $40,000 in Bitcoin that was given to the Texas Bitcoin Association in order to fund the Texas Bitcoin Conference 2013 was "lost", which happened conveniently when the issue of having to pay back the creditors came up...\n\nTo my surprise, two of us board members from the association were being denied access to any of the expense reports or spreadsheets detailing just how much money was spent on throwing the conference and where that money was going. What was originally billed as $200k conference ballooned into (and the number changes every time I hear it) as far as $750k, now anyone in their right mind would ask "How the hell did the Texas Bitcoin Conference cost three quarters of a million dollars???".\n\nSeeing that **alanX** was spending money at an out of control rate, I and another board member decided it was in our best interest to get on paper that we were not liable for the debts that he was accruing without our authorization. So we have a meeting and it\'s agreed that we\'re not liable for the debts the association is racking up without any oversight (sound familiar?).\n\nSo while all of this money is being thrown around (that he doesn\'t have), **alanX** realizes that sponsors aren\'t going to cover the cost of the conference (which anyone would have been able to determine had they seen the spreadsheets which he refused to share). So he goes behind the board\'s back, and decides to reach out to none other than David Johnston with BitAngels (Mastercoin), Sam Yilmaz, and Brock Pierce (yeah, that Brock Pierce) to beg for money.\n\nThey agree, and here is the contract that proves what I\'m saying:\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/86YFYJj.jpg\n\nIn fact, here\'s David Johnston last week acknowledging that the contract is real: https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/2je9y6/is_it_just_a_coincidence_that_brock_pierce_is/clckjgv?context=3\n\nSo **alanX** decides that since it\'s in the contract now that we\'re not liable for the money he\'s throwing around (which has far surpassed the money coming in at this point), that we should resign because we don\'t want to just cover his ass (and why should we have, he refused to even tell us what he was spending the money on). So I step up to resign first, and in doing so I want to transfer my shares of the association to another person, and since they were MY shares, I should have been able to do that in any way I felt appropriate (in that I wanted to give all of my shares to a single person).\n\nHe disagreed and decided that since I and another board member didn\'t want to just hand over all of our shares to him (going so far as to make comments like "Well are you going to pay for my new roof next year?!"), that he would sue us to force us out of the company instead. So he threatens to sue us for $200k, if we don\'t resign without giving up all of our shares. Later did I only discern that we were also forced out because the trio that bought 2 board seats decided they didn\'t want any opposition on the board to bad ideas. (Spending insane amounts of money without any records was a bad idea to me).\n\n(Edit: I need to add here that the reason I was giving my shares to a specific person, was because this was someone that the board had previously unanimously voted on taking over my position, and it was someone I nominated for the role because I felt they would keep tabs on the Association so as to not soil the company name, and to prevent them from doing things like throwing $5k per seat dinners for legislators in Texas (which ended up happening after the events written here). When he realized that this person was going to have the same voting share as I did, **alanX** wanted to strip that power from them by taking all of my shares for himself so that he could continue doing what he wanted with a majority vote in the company without anyone telling him "no").\n\n(Edit: I also want to point out at this point, that in my resignation contract, he tried to have a non-disclosure agreement in there so that I wouldn\'t be able to tell anyone about what happened. I argued against it and it was removed from the contract because I refused to sign it otherwise. I felt an obligation to be able to talk about what happened.)\n\nCome to find out, that although I got the brute force of the negativity behind the conference, that several other volunteers from not only the Austin Bitcoin Meetup, but other meetups in Texas, also got burned or mistreated by **alanX** and his wife at the Texas Bitcoin Conference. I felt this was incredibly wrong, because the money that started the conference came directly from those very same volunteers and donators, and that if it wasn\'t for those people in the community, the conference would have gone even worse than it did. It\'s the people in the Bitcoin community that make Bitcoin, and mistreating them when they take time out of their daily lives to volunteer all day for your conference is very wrong. \n\nSo to make a point of it, I sent the Texas Bitcoin Association a letter stating that they were no longer welcome at the Meetup for not only threatening to sue several of our members (who were board members) for money that he himself spent without any oversight, but also for mistreating the members that volunteered and for selling out the association to none other than Brock Pierce. To stress that this was the reason he wasn\'t welcome back anymore, I also made a point of telling him that he was welcome back for the low sum of $200k (it wasn\'t meant as a serious number, it was to make a joke of the fact that he tried to wrongly sue us for that same amount of money but of course that went over his head and he tells people that I tried to charge him money to attend the meetup which is only true if you\'re unable to process irony or sarcasm).\n\nIt would have been able to end peacefully there, but he started showing back up at the meetups and started spreading false rumors about I and others, and was generally trying to split up the group to kick anyone who disagreed with him out. Unfortunately for him, he didn\'t realize that most of the group could see what he was doing, and that nobody appreciated the drama he was trying to create. So as the founder of the meetup, I asked him to leave, because he was making people feel uncomfortable. Also because I didn\'t want anyone else to get sucked into another one of his debt pits again. \n\nNaturally he was understanding and agreed to leave right? Hardly. It ended with him screaming at I and another person at the Bookstore (you could hear him shouting from the hallways), and ultimately being asked to leave by the store staff because he was creating a scene. \n\nAnd we haven\'t seen him at the meetups since.\n\nEven Phinnaeus Gage , referred to as the "most interesting person in bitcoin", has posted his opposition to **alanX** after he discovered what was going on during his digging into Brock Pierce and company: \n\nhttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=620267.msg6869616#msg6869616 \nhttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=626554.msg6979703#msg6979703\netc. etc.\n\ntl;dr - what **alanX** is saying is true only if you leave out huge important details from the story. He was asked not to come back for creating unnecessary drama, and so that I could protect the other meetup members from what he had already gotten away with against several other of our members. Nobody is telling him he can\'t have his own meetup, and I\'m not telling anyone not to attend his meetups, but I think people should know the truth and make that decision for themselves. \n\nI may have missed a detail or two, but certainly not on purpose, and I will elaborate on whatever is necessary if something is missing here. I will also gladly provide records of these conversations and all to prove what I am saying as well.\n\nEdit: Typos, although there are likely many more.
