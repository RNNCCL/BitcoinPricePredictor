I put about 15 Bitcoins in my wallet and I think they gave me 3 more - I somehow remember the number being 18. The purchase was done using Paypal (as I recall) and my total came to less than a dollar. I had an interest in cryptocurrencies at the time, so I figured it\'d be interesting to have a little loose change in bitcoins, just to say I had some.\n\nLong time goes by and I don\'t hear much about bitcoin.

I did some research on what people recommend, tried several services which a few days later, everybody is warning people away from that service/method. Drove me crazy, and I pretty much wanted to give up. But then, some generous redditor tipped me the minimum bitcoin (I forget, like .0000183 of a bitcoin or something).

Just the sheer amount of propagating innovation built on Bitcoin is astounding.\n\nI'm a bit disappointed in how bitcoin can't support true microtrxs, but this isn't necessarily a bad thing. Kind of like gold doesn't make a great currency. Namely the 3 to 5 cent mining fee can be significant when compared to 10 cent tip. Also, a 10 cent tip doesn't need to be recorded in the blockchain public ledger of all time. In short, a tip can be forgotten within a month, and ideally it should be forgotten. The amount is also insignificant, so the liability hardly requires the security of private key.\n\nI offer that a solution could be built around the concept of an IOU or personal ledger of outstanding payments. Rather than record a bitcoin exchange, an IOU is created containing the target address and the amount. These would be collected to either an amount limit (credit) or the due date. Then, perhaps on the first of the month, all of the IOUs are settled up with one bitcoin transaction with multiple addresses. In this mode, this could be a completely standalone app, or an option added to any wallet.\n\nIt's like changetip, which is a great system for tipping, but changetip needs to gather and hold your bitcoins up front and they must become an ongoing account with security and a ledger, and yet one more place to create a wallet. With the IOU approach, it only keeps the ledger long enough to pay off the IOUs, and it merely works with your current wallet to formulate the batch payment.\n\nAt first, this might only work tips and donations, but it will save users money on these microtrxs. At some point, it could become popular to take IOUs, like running a tab at a bar, and then settle up. This would require an on-line service, but it would provide other services too. Other benefits could include building a credit worthiness score, real loans, pay all your bills in one shot, rewards programs, etc.\n\nAll of this would be done without the IOU system making yet another wallet and private key.

It is absolutely not sure whether there is enough uranium left at all to generate all that tritium.\n\n* Further, there is the idea that fusion reactors should generate their own tritium fuel by irradiating lithium with neutrons from the fusion reaction. This is very difficult, as in the deuterium-tritium reaction there is **no** neutron surplus, this means every neutron needs to be used that way or the reproduction rate will be below one, leading to a die-out of fuel. To put this whole situation into a picture, it is like you need to survive the winter in Alaska in a hut in the forests. And all you have is a stove and big pile of wood, and a can of gasoline to light it first (the uranium). However your pile of wood is very wet and you would need the stove to dry it first. And the stove has low efficiency at drying. So it is very unlikely that you can maintain the reaction.\n\n* Additionally, there have been breeding schemes suggested, which generate additional neutrons, using elements such as boron and additional nuclear chemistry. In effect, this gives a complex breeder reaction. The thing is that breeder reactions have not been successful in any place than Japan\'s Monju reactor and they are highly complex and  even dangerous - see the [Monju Sodium Fire](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monju_Nuclear_Power_Plant#Monju_sodium_leak_and_fire). \n\n* Additionally, the most advanced designs for nuclear fusion reactors are of the ITER type which would require a huge breeding blanket. However, after many decades of research there are no materials known which would withstand the extreme forces, magnetic fields, high temperatures and extreme neutron flux in such a blanket. In fact, the technology necessary for the blanket is not even investigated in the ITER experiment - ITER is purely about plasma physics, not about breeding tritium or energy generation. In other words, the scientists which design ITER avoid the most critical questions.\n\n* Additionally, you might have seen pretty photos with mean in white laboratory coats running around in a fusion reactor vessel. These photos imply that fusion has no radiation problem, but this is a lie. In fact, once a reaction with tritium was run in such a reactor, it has to go through a expensive and lengthy decontamination phase before anybody can enter the reactor vessel again.  In fact, the decontamination is so laborious that experiments like ITER avoid using tritium in the first years altogether.\n\n* Additionally, key nuclear properties for fusion-breeder reactions like cross-section coefficients are not even known with sufficient certainty and precision to even compute how things would work. \n\nSome source on that:\n\nhttp://www.fusion.ucla.edu/abdou/abdou%20publications/2006/FED-v81-SawanPhysics.pdf\n\n\nSo much about "you can filter the fuel for fusion from seawater". \n\nIt is not impossible that all these preblems will be solved in some distant future, but at the present time, energy generation from fusion is little more than a scam.\n\n\n': 1, 'http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/jun/16/greenpeace-loses-3m-pounds-currency-speculation\n\n': 0, "Being against nuclear is in practice the same as being for coal/gas/other cheap energy sources.

Literally millions of dollars is spent in research and development of reactor designs to lower the risk of accident to acceptable levels. \'Acceptable levels\' is sometimes measured by risk of death per worker per year, and is benchmarked against other sectors (transportation, coal plants, etc.). The standards for nuclear industry are higher both in implementation and practice. An airplane can crash in Super Bowl and kills tens of thousands, but we consider the risk and accommodate. We don\'t take an anti-airplane stance.\n\n>  science has yet to devise a method for adequately handling long lived radioactive wastes.\n\nWhat to do with the nuclear waste is a political problem, not technical. See France for an example of a country that has no nuclear waste problem. The US was going to permanently store it\'s waste in Yucca Mountain, but it fell through.\n\n> For years nuclear plants have been leaking radioactive waste from underground pipes and radioactive waste pools into the ground water at sites across the nation. \n\nCitation needed. Literally every material in nature is radioactive.\n\n> In addition to being extremely dangerous, the continued greenwashing of nuclear power from industry-backed lobbyists diverts investments away from clean, renewable sources of energy. In contrast to nuclear power, renewable energy is both clean and safe. Technically accessible renewable energy sources are capable of producing six times more energy than current global demand.\n\nThis is misleading in so many levels. It manages to sneak in "nuclear is extremely dangerous" without any backing. It assumes that nuclear power is "greenwashed" and other energy sources present objective arguments. It assumes renewable energy sources can power industry and can follow load (can increase energy production when people turn on their electronics). It assumes that investment in renewables can be easily made and the power easily distributed literally across continents (where you can most easily produce power is usually where there is least demand for power).\n\n> If the nuclear industry and Wall Street financiers are unwilling to assume the economic risk of constructing new nuclear power plants, why should the American taxpayer?\n\nThis is very USA-centric. Investment in new nuclear plants have stagnated over the past decades, perhaps mostly due to natural gas prices. Think space exploration, who *would* invest in that, and who *should* invest in it?\n\n> The original cost estimate was $45 billion. The actual cost was $145 billion! Forbes magazine recognized that this "failure of the U.S. nuclear power program ranks as the largest managerial disaster in business history, a disaster of monumental scale."\n\nIt is well known that first-of-a-kind nuclear reactor designs have cost overruns. I invite someone to do an analysis on big projects (skyscrapers, bridges, dams, airplanes, etc.) and look at what are typical initial estimate vs final cost.\n\n> The Cold War may be over, but this does not mean nuclear weapons have disappeared. Far from it: There are almost 36,000 nuclear weapons in the world, thousands on hair-trigger alert, with more than a third of them ready to launch at a moment\'s notice, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Over 400 reactors in warships and nuclear submarines are still circling the globe.\n\nThis is a red herring. We\'re talking about civilian nuclear power. However, I have a counter example: Ever since nuclear weapons were invented there has not been a major battle between nuclear states.\n\n> From the dawn of the nuclear age, it has been recognized that nuclear power and nuclear weapons are inextricably linked. The spread of nuclear technology and ultimately nuclear weapons undermines our national security and the security of the planet.\n\nThis is silly, there are many countries that have nuclear reactors without nuclear weapons. Research in nuclear also increases the knowledge on *detecting* nuclear weapons production. If others are making the weapons we will be more likely to find out and do something about it. I would argue nuclear power therefore increases our national security.\n\n> Greenpeace has been shouting about nuclear dangers for nearly forty years, beginning on September 15, 1971, when the Greenpeace founders protested U.S. nuclear testing.\n\nYou have picked a side on an issue more than three decades ago. Imagine the technology we had back then and what we have now. Nuclear energy is getting even better and safer as time goes on. (Even back then I would argue anti-nuclear is bad.)\n\nArguing against nuclear is very short-sighted without presenting alternatives. Renewable energies cannot be an alternative to nuclear as they stand right now. The wind doesn\'t always blow and the sun doesn\'t always shine. The places where wind blows a lot and sun shines very bright aren\'t the places humans want to live. Bringing electricity to them costs a lot due to the inefficiencies of power lines. Industrial level energy storage could greatly improve the utility of renewable energies, but if we had industrial scale energy storage then nuclear would also become much cheaper (I can explain this later if people are interested.)\n\nThis is why I think "green"peace is doing more harm than good by taking an anti-nuclear position.': 8, "Ehh depends on whether or not you agree with greenpeace's tactics.

Source to that:\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grid_parity\n\nThis is good because bitcoin allows investors into solar power to monetize the energy they generate. And the latter is important because - similar to nuclear power - most of the investment comes long before enough energy returning the value can be harvested, which makes it difficult to prepare for the coming scarcity of fossil fuels. With  Bitcoin, such investments can be paid much sooner.  To some extend, bitcoin is energy investment paid by its seignorage.\n\nBitcoin also helps to work temporarily around the issue that it is much cheaper to generate electricity from solar power than to store it, because you can convert electricity to  bitcoins and store these.\n\nAll in all bitcoin will become a huge boost to renewable power once ASIC hardware is cheap enough that electricity costs are dominant again - and the latter is already happening. Bitcoin will simply boost innovation and investments in cheap power generation and the sources will be increasingly renewables, simply because renewables are cheaper.\n\nThere's another neat aspect with proof-of-work: Generating bitcoin requires a certain amount of physical work in terms of electricity. In this way, the value of bitcoin is coupled to the value of energy - if energy prices go up, bitcoin's value will grow, too, while the dollar will crumble.\n\nHowever, bitcoin units **are not equivalent** to a certain fixed amount of energy. This is because the price of bitcoin (and the energy expended to create new ones) depends on the *current* market price, which is growing. It is more correct to say that bitcoins **symbolize** energy, because the energy required to create them is is measured by the current difficulty of creation. For example, Satoshi's first coins today have the same value, and thus represent the same amount of energy, as newly generated coins. But **Satoshi's coins (and nearly all bitcoins generated before) required a vastly lower expense of energy to create them**. By this way, Bitcoins symbolize energy (which is a good approach for a more sustainable kind of money), but in an efficient way.\n\nTo put the extend of this into some perspective, look at this logarithmic plot of bitcoins price evolution over time:\n\nhttp://bitcoincharts.com/charts/mtgoxUSD#tgSzm1g10zm2g25zvzl\n\nYou see that until about January 2013, the bitcoin price was mostly below 10 dollars. Consequently, before that time, it was never economical to expend more electrical energy than with a cost of 10 USD to generate one bitcoin. And more than half of all bitcoins were generated before that time. That means that today, a bitcoin with a price of around 400 USD was generated using energy of less than 10 USD, and with some probability even  less than 0.1 USD.": 2, "You still need someone to collect deposits in bulk and give out loans.

In change management terms we could say that the payments industry is "unfrozen" or at least "thawing" to the prospect of change. \n\nWe\'ve been using 1970s technology for many decades now and it\'s clear that we\'re at the end of the line for credit cards (I\'m thinking of the US here). That leaves us at a crossroads. \n\n* Do we simply patch up the bleeding wounds with a closed, proprietary fix? Apple Pay is somewhat more secure and has several big players on board. \n\n* Do we make a major technology upgrade in the form of chip & pin EMV technology that Europe already has? Certainly, that\'s where the credit cards companies like Visa want to go. \n\n* But do merchants even need to buy expensive, black-box card-processing units from vendors who have a horrible track record of not only getting hacked, but being ignorant of that fact for months at a time? \n\nIt seems like the time has come for upstarts like Square who can offer a payment solution that does it all, especially since they are using tools like iPads and Nexus tablets that can be upgraded independently of Sqaure\'s card reader, which is just a dumb reader tied to their software. \n\nSquare is really a software vendor and what technology can be added to their stack with relative simplicity? Bitcoin. All you need is an internet connection and a screen to display QR codes. Boom. Done. Why *wouldn\'t* you add bitcoin capability, especially when you\'re competing with vendors who are trying to lock merchants into a single stack that they control. \n\nSquare\'s value offering is it\'s inexpensiveness and the myriad choices it can offer to merchants and consumers without diluting their ease of use. The idea of a "cash register" is going to become an anachronism in a few years since most payments will be done digitally with iPads and other tablets. Why buy expensive proprietary solutions that are obsolete in a few months anyway? \n\nPayments processing is about to be hit by the same wave that hit the GPS Navigation industry and the MP3 Player industry. Why pay for a specialized device when a widely available consumer device can do the same thing just as well and with a lot less cost? And the great thing about general purpose devices is that it\'s a cinch to add new software that does more. When looked at through this lens, Bitcoin starts to look like a part of the payments space almost by default. It\'s more secure than a credit card and it doesn\'t take any additional hardware if you\'ve already got a tablet. For mom & pop shops, it\'s a slam dunk. \n\nFor big retailers like Walmart, it\'s not such a sure thing, but they are motivated by high credit card processing fees to create alternative systems. Every fraction of a percent could be the difference between a profitable quarter or a losing one.
