I spend all day reviewing code... if I weren't already fairly expert in reviewing ECC code, I'd have probably gotten nowhere.\n\n> I certainly did not mean to imply that this is production-ready or should be used by anyone for any serious storage of funds.\n\nFair enough.\n\n> Code is, for the most part, self-documenting\n\nYes/no. I mean, I could tell what you were doing generally, so indeed that justifies the self-documenting at least with respect to people who are already experienced with this kind of code.\n\nBut for example, in your addition formula you seemed (at a glance) to be using a somewhat unconventional approach to detecting cancellation; the more common construction is to directly compare the inputs to each other. As a reviewer I'd normally want to see some argument as to why that particular approach is sound.  There are a number of other places where comments would be helpful,  also documenting your input/output return behavior can make things much nicer to review.  Restatements of the ASM as (pseudo-)C or algebra would have been nice.\n\nBut you didn't ask me to review it, so I'm not /complaining/.  If you were advancing this code for public use I might argue that it should meet a higher standard, e.g. being commented a bit more intensely than strictly necessary-- if no other reason that so people will review it.\n\n(For example of the kind of comment-giving-an-arguement that I'm talking about see https://github.com/bitcoin/secp256k1/blob/master/src/ecdsa_impl.h#L157 which argues that we can compare  x mod order with a jacobian point without performing an inversion, for a couple percent speedup for ECDSA verification.)\n\n> Regarding the order of evaluation of function arguments\n\nRight, I don't ~think~ it's wrong. But I wouldn't bet my life on it, even after staring at it for a couple minutes it's hard to tell; thus my comment was that it was hard to review. That you were aware that it's unspecified in the language makes it less likely that you made an error there.\n\n> I personally will use it because I have been using this elliptic-curve math code in production on a site that handles thousands of bitcoins\n\nWe'd love to have your help on libsecp256k1 making sure that it fits on the smallest devices. Right now its constant time scalar*G uses 65536 bytes of table, but it could be reduced to 1024 bytes with a trivial change as a compile time option and still likely be considerably faster than your code, I'd guess about 2.5x faster; as it would take 64add + 64double rather than 128add (average) + 256double; even though the constant time add is about 13% slower than a branchy one, and you save half your adds on average due to being variable time.).\n\nWorking on a highly visible public project has the benefit of getting strong peer review that a smaller effort has a hard time getting. It becomes harder for the project to slack off and fail to test or verify something that is 'obviously correct' but might not actually be, and more resources are available to take care of considerations which wouldn't otherwise be worth your time (like tests; or formal proofs of correctness); more reviewers also means a substantial reduction in human error, plus you get people critically checking the code in more environments which sometimes elevates bugs which are too hard to observe to something practically visible.\n\nLets imagine the counterfactual: Say your code was broken in some subtle way and resulted in it eventually gobbling bitcoins and caused that site to lose a bunch of them (presumably they belong to other people), what might the post-mortem say? If it were me, I wouldn't expose myself to that. And while you might be much more meticulous about writing correct code than I am, that it was enough would be a hard argument to make to people suffering perfect hindslight.\n": 5, "> Someone should make a Diceware ASIC.\n\nI actually think an ASIC would be *less* secure than the calculator. The calculator is so general-purpose that its components are very unlikely to have any crypto-specific back doors in them.

Even my old HW2 TI-89 has over 200 KiB of user-accessible RAM for storing programs. The word list might take 16 KiB of that, assuming 2048 words with an average length of 7 characters. The newer hardware revisions have more RAM.\n\n> Also, what is the feasibility of BIP38?

TiLP works with all known GraphLink cables.': 3, "Yeah, mine's 16 years old, and it's been sitting on a shelf basically untouched for the last 9 of those until now. I started out trying to write the program in TI-BASIC to take advantage of AMS's built-in support for arbitrary-precision arithmetic, but it was just way too inefficient and would have been super awkward for implementing SHA-256 and RIPEMD-160, so I went looking for a C compiler and found TIGCC.": 3, 'It would be easy to do it if I used the na\xc3\xafve algorithm:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor each input roll, multiply the key accumulator by the base of the input (the number of sides on the input die) and then add the value of the roll (minus one) to the key acculumator.\xe2\x80\x9d (The key accumulator initially contains zero.)\n\nThe complication is that I don\'t use the na\xc3\xafve algorithm for building up the key from the die rolls. For dice with a number of sides that is not a power of 2, the bits of entropy contributed by each roll does not divide evenly into 256 bits. For instance, a 6-sided die contributes ~2.58496 bits of entropy per roll. Therefore, 99 rolls is not enough, but 100 rolls is too many. Taking 100 rolls of a 6-sided die means that it may be possible to generate a key that is larger than *n*, the cyclic order of the generator point on the secp256k1 curve. The correct thing to do when generating a private key randomly is to throw away any generated key that is equal to or greater than *n* and generate another. (You don\'t simply compute the remainder because then you introduce a slight bias favoring lesser key values.) In order to save the user from doing 100 rolls only to find out that they\'ll have to do 100 more, I build up the key from the "high end" rather than from the low end. This allows the process to fail early, and the user is prompted to start over after only a very small number of rolls (usually one). The downside is that this requires the base of every roll to be known in advance. It would be possible to use heterogeneous dice with this algorithm, but it would require inputting the dice rolls in a regular and predictable pattern.': 1, "How slow would the TI-89 do 100,000 sha256 iterations?

When you get a refund on a CC, your original transaction doesn\'t disappear; they refund your money in another transaction.\n\nEither they are confused or lying about how their Bitcoin payment infrastructure works. There are other vendors that handle Bitcoin refunds in a much more graceful manner. TigerDirect is kind of a sketchy vendor to begin with (same for Rakuten aka Buy.com). So when dealing with bad vendors like them, I\'d rather just stick with the consumer protections on my credit card.\n\n**EDIT:** Oh yeah, I did sign up for the Google protection as well. When I contacted them regarding the refund issue, they said that bitcoin transactions were not covered under the program.

The kids whom Ciavarella wrongly sent to prison cannot sue him for damages, but that doesn\'t mean Ciavarella didn\'t get what was coming to him.

This is mainly because neither Carl Force or Shaun Bridges contributed in any way to the evidence or testimony against Ulbricht. (They were part of a supposedly separate investigation by the Baltimore AG\'s office.)\n\nBut there are now two wild cards potentially in play:\n\nThe first wild card is, if Ulbricht\'s team can find evidence showing that Force and/or Bridges participated in the NY investigation, then any evidence arising from their participation could be thrown out, potentially resulting in a new trial.\n\nBut that shouldn\'t get Judge Forrest in any trouble, provided that any participation by Force or Bridges was unknown to her.\n\nWhich brings me to wild card #2, which is that if evidence emerges showing that Judge Forrest *did* know that Force and/or Bridges provided evidence against Ulbricht, yet kept that information from the defense or from the court, that would likely amount to judicial misconduct.\n\nThe punishment for that type of misconduct would certainly not be exposure to civil liability in a lawsuit brought by Ulbricht. Again, immunity. The bar association could levy sanctions against her. But for criminal charges to arise, the degree of misconduct would have to be brazen, blatant, and shocking.

The reason why person without right background gets confused is exactly because one of the most "vicious" properties of money called *fungibility*. Fungibility makes every dollar to be exactly the same as the "other" dollar, and camouflages the principle of "Old Money vs. New Money" which is the **property of the function of the money** (not to be confused with property of money).\n\nThis concept is well established and widely used by financial companies for surrender charge rules, for example. Financial product may have vesting schedule associated with each deposit for the purpose of surrender. For example 5 year old deposit may have 0% surrender fee and 1 year old deposit may carry 5% surrender fee. If customer makes multiple deposits over 5 year period and then makes one withdrawal that depletes several of these deposits, company may apply FIFO or LIFO rule and start calculating surrender charges for each deposit based on its vested schedule. \n\nThis is exactly the scenario where 5 year old dollar is given back to you at full value, and 1 year old dollar is given back at 95 cents, because financial company is smart and knows the principle I am describing.\n\nIt is easy to dupe consumer because **fungibility property of money camouflages the principle of "Old Money vs New Money"** and because consumers naturally think about money in declarative terms as opposite to procedural.\n\nImagine for a second, if each dollar bill had printed time stamp on it. Then it would be super easy to calculate today\'s value of each bill by simply discounting its value by historical interest rate and derive to today\'s value of that bill. If that bill\'s value does not correspond to the spot market value, then it is indication that something went wrong with either historically declared interest rates or spot market value. However, if you erase that time stamp from each dollar bill - you have no mechanism to check historical interest rates against declared market value of dollar today.\n\nI assume you can see now, how Bitcoin offers elegant solution to such problem :)\n\nWhen there is no transparency and control mechanisms - the temptation for abuse and corruption starts crippling into the system. Over time corruption breeds corruption, abuse breeds abuse, and spiral goes down to all valleys of society. One day we wake up and we realize we do not live in the world we used to know, and we do not know why it happened.\n\nPeople do not realize it yet, how immensely powerful the concept of Bitcoin is, and in how many different ways Bitcoin principle will change our perception of finance, governance, and the world in general.\n\nYou will not take me seriously today, if I tell you that the most fundamental principles of finance, time value of money, and theory of interest will get serious scrutiny and review from economists and scholars in the very near time. Yet mark my word there will be noble prize awarded for re-work of concepts in this area. Principle of bitcoin will soon change perception of finance and economics in a very fundamental ways.\n\nSupport my work if you find this to be  important  :)\n\n': 1, '[removed]': 1, "> I don't see any difference between the fed and bitcoin. In each case there is a single issuing authority (fed / block reward formula) issuing to someone (us treasury, miners).\n\nThe differences are the following: \n\nFor FED vs. blockchain reward formula:\nFED has two roles to play -  FED authorize and FED issues currencies. In bitcoin world those roles are separated - blockchain formula plays only role of authorization and Miners issue currencies in exchange for significant resources.  FED can flood the system with cash tomorrow without any resources involved.  Miners cannot - blockchain formula authorizes printing at pre-defined rate and only in exchange for significant amount of resources.  \n\n**QUESTION: Even with the system of checks and balances in place, which system is prone to more human mistake and abuse?**     \n\nFOR DOLLARS:\nFED will inject cash via established distribution channels. The order of participants in the distribution channel will always remain the same. As newly printed cash trickles down through system it creates wave of price increase. Getting cash and spending! right before the wave of price increase gives business real competitive advantage.  Wave of price increase has has speed, power of impact, and direction.  All three, speed, power of impact, and direction, can be manipulated via legislative mechanisms that I will talk about in the next draft I plan to release shortly.  \n\nFOR BITCOIN:\nBitcoin network will inject currency via eco-system of miners in connection with multiple distribution channels created by market forces.  This means the impact created by newly printed currencies is more reflective of market forces than in the case of centralized distribution.  There will be multiple epicenters of waves of impact, therefore creating more leveled impact on distribution overall.  Such system significantly diminishes the benefit of being first in line in getting the coin, and thus removes from the system the very reason for abuse and corruption. \n\nThis is an example how changing the system design eliminates from the system itself element of corruption and mechanism for abuse :)\n\nI do not claim bitcoin will resolve all world problems - but this is an example, and big one, how the system can be improved by removing from the system the essence of temptation for abuse and corruption. My paper plans to draw more macro-examples like this one, so feel free to support my effort :)  \n\nNext draft with more info is coming out shortly.\n  \n \n": 1, 'You keep insinuating that new dollars are worth more than old ones even though this is patently false.\n\nTell me, if I show your a dollar bill, how can you measure how new it is?

Miners do not generally sell their bitcoins retail. So very few people have this option.\n\nCompared with dollars - *everyone* (pretty much) really does have the option of buying a newly minted treasury bond, just visit your bank's website and find out how to buy.\n\nFortunately this doesn't matter, a new bitcoin is worth the same as an old one. Same for dollars. See my point above.": 1, "> Newly printed dollars are not worth more than old ones, it's simply nonsense to say this. \n\nNewly printed dollars dilute the value of all dollars in circulation, but not right away - and this is the most important key.  That extra printed dollar needs to get recognized by economy, and this becomes a multi-step process.  One who is at the starting point of that process, benefits a lot more than one who is in the middle of that process sinse half prices already adjusted and half still did not.  One who is at the very end of this process does not get any extra value out of it.  But whatever assets he had just got depleted via price increase.  \n\nBy this mechanism if you mark all the dollars with distinct number then the older the dollar, the less of money it has.  But because of fungibility of dollar - every dollar is the same - that effect is being masked, and it becomes confusing.": 1, "> This makes no sense. A newly printed dollar is worth no more or less and an existing dollar (same with bitcoin).\n\nThat's exactly my point.  People do not realize that newly printed dollar at the top is worth a lot more than the same dollar once it trickles down to the bottom.  \n\nInflation has propagation speed. In other words newly printed dollar has full value when used in first purchase.  When it is used in second purchase, it has a bit less of value, because market has recognized the existence of newly printed dollar, and adjusted the price. When dollar gets to the bottom, at the wager's level, the devaluation is fully materialized.  Wagers are too late to get onto the market with their dollars.  Prices have been adjusted fully.  \n": 1}, ('Funding my Microsoft account with Bitcoin was surprisingly magical!', 110): {"Why's that, rydan? Last I heard MS plans to expand their bitcoin play.
