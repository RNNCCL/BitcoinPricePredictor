This is a bearish opinion held by many traditional investors, but not one you would expect from the man responsible for turning the virtual currency into a commodity worth billions.\n\n>Yet, that is the view of Gavin Andresen, chief scientist at the Bitcoin Foundation, the closest thing to a central bank for the nascent cryptocurrency. He is considered the leading custodian of the bitcoin code, the rules and software used to run the cryptocurrency. But far from being a cheerleader, Mr Andresen, is warning ordinary people to avoid bitcoin \xe2\x80\x94 for now. \n\n>\xe2\x80\x9cIt actually is dangerous and people should be aware it\xe2\x80\x99s like the early internet,\xe2\x80\x9d he tells the Financial Times. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you lived through time, you remember lots of press articles came out saying don\xe2\x80\x99t give internet companies your credit card details. But the internet grew past that. Bitcoin will be the same way. Over time, I will stop saying to people, \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t use it unless you\xe2\x80\x99re technically proficient enough to keep your computer secure\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n>Concerns about security were heightened on Monday after Bitstamp, Europe\xe2\x80\x99s leading bitcoin exchange, suspended its operations following an apparent hack that led to the company losing 19,000 bitcoins, worth about $5m.\n\n>These safety issues have led to a steady fall in the price of the cryptocurrency. At its peak, bitcoin was traded for $1,240 on the Mt Gox exchange, the Japanese group that filed for bankruptcy last year after losing about $450m worth of bitcoin in a cyber attack. According to Coindesk, the bitcoin news site, the price is now about $283. \n\n>\xe2\x80\x9cBitstamp is handling the incident well,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr Andresen says, by being transparent and explaining to customers what happened. \xe2\x80\x9cI hope they take the time to publish a complete postmortem on details of the attack, so other exchanges can learn from their mistakes. \n\n>\xe2\x80\x9cI hope Mt Gox does the same because we still don\xe2\x80\x99t know what happened.\xe2\x80\x9d \n\n>Mr Andresen is considered the prot\xc3\xa9g\xc3\xa9 to \xe2\x80\x9cSatoshi Nakamoto\xe2\x80\x9d, the name adopted by the supposed inventor of bitcoin. After collaborating on the project over email, Mr Andresen was given Mr Nakamoto\xe2\x80\x99s blessing to become the \xe2\x80\x9ccore maintainer\xe2\x80\x9d of the bitcoin source code, working full time on the project.\n\n>While Nakamoto appears to have vanished, Mr Andresen wields huge influence on the development of the currency. He helped to found the Bitcoin Foundation in 2012 and groups from financial regulators to the CIA seek his advice. \n\n>His knowledge of bitcoin has led to suggestions he may actually be Nakamoto. \xe2\x80\x9cI am not Satoshi,\xe2\x80\x9d he laughs. \xe2\x80\x9cAsk any geek. Point them to code written by Satoshi and point them to code written by me. You can tell, they\xe2\x80\x99re not the same guy.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n>His theory is that the inventor is \xe2\x80\x9ca young academic type, somewhere in the world. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think Japan. Perhaps the British Isles actually because in Satoshi\xe2\x80\x99s communications he [used British rather than American spellings]. I think there\xe2\x80\x99s an academic thinking about other stuff, sitting on a big pile of bitcoin.\xe2\x80\x9d \n\n>The one person who Mr Andresen says is definitely not Satoshi Nakamoto is Dorian S. Nakamoto, the Japanese-American engineer that Newsweek named as bitcoin\xe2\x80\x99s inventor last year. Mr Nakamoto, who lives in California, denies any role in bitcoin. \n\n>\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s not the Satoshi I talked to,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr Andresen. \xe2\x80\x9cI feel sorry for Dorian that so much personal attention got focused on this person. That shows why the actual Satoshi has worked so hard to stay anonymous.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n>His influence at the Bitcoin Foundation could soon increase, after it emerged Jim Harper, its global policy counsel, was dismissed earlier this month. The move is seen as a shift in focus for the non-profit group away from policy and regulation and back towards developing bitcoin\xe2\x80\x99s core technology.\n\n>\xe2\x80\x9cIt is always hard when an organisation pivots and priorities change,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cEffective organisations have a clear mission and focus and there is plenty of work to be done on the technical front to keep the foundation busy.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n>Though Mr Andresen concedes bitcoin remains in the early days of its development, he is confident it will mature, noting that more than $300m of venture money had been invested in bitcoin start-ups in 2014.\n\n>Mr Andresen is also at the forefront of efforts to ready the virtual currency for wider use. As it is currently designed, the bitcoin network can process just seven transactions a second. By comparison, Visa is capable of handling close to 50,000 transaction a second at peak times.\n\n>Mr Andresen\xe2\x80\x99s proposed solution is to increase the size of bitcoin blocks, the files that hold the data that underpins the currency. Their size limits the speed at which the bitcoin network can process transactions. Larger blocks can contain more transactions and, therefore, increase the capacity of the network.\n\n>But there are concerns that increasing the block size will put a strain on the network. Bigger blocks packed with more transactions requires transmitting and storing more data. This may also make it difficult for hobbyists to store a full copy of the \xe2\x80\x9cblockchain\xe2\x80\x9d, centralising power in the hands of corporations that can afford expensive servers in big data centres.\n\n>The issue is being debated by bitcoin developers. But Mr Andresen says that \xe2\x80\x9cwe\xe2\x80\x99re really close to consensus\xe2\x80\x9d to approve his proposal, a move that \xe2\x80\x9cin 20 years, would allow us to have enough capacity to handle every single electronic transaction in the world\xe2\x80\x9d. \n\n>While Mr Andresen tries to prepare bitcoin for mass usage, he advises caution to investors. He holds thousands of bitcoins, enough to retire comfortably. But he has been cashing them in slowly, investing in stock market funds instead.\n\n>\xe2\x80\x9cBitcoin is wild and crazy investment that I\xe2\x80\x99m diversifying out of all the time,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cIf bitcoin is wildly successful, I\xe2\x80\x99m still holding on to a good chunk of bitcoin. It could be worth tens of millions of dollars, but it could be worth zero. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make sense to hold more than that amount. I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a desire to be a multi-billionaire. That\xe2\x80\x99s not what motivates me, I have no desire to be filthy rich.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n>Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2015': 3, "Thanks for this...\nSome pretty irresponsible comments from Gavin here...he should stick with coding and keep away from the press...but I suspect his ego got the better of him and he reckons he's the expert in everything Bitcoin now.\n\n>Bitcoin is dangerous and people should steer away from using it.\n>But he has been cashing them in slowly, investing in stock market funds instead.\n>It could be worth tens of millions of dollars, but it could be worth zero.\n\nWTF?": 1, ">but I suspect his ego got the better of him and he reckons he's the expert in everything Bitcoin now.\n\nOr maybe he is being misquoted or taken out of context?

As an Aussie, you should know that charging a 1% fee for processing a BTC transaction is highway robbery, as our banks charge SIGNIFICANTLY less than the US. Avg. fees paid by all the merchants I tried to sell this bullshit technology to had their sphincters clench up at a 1% fee, as they were paying CBA only 1.5%. The pay PayPal a similar amount.  \n\n- Local Aussie products are ugly as fuck, and are html based. The good looking stuff is too expensive to use. It\'s not rocket science to make a clean looking app that you can log into as a merchant, and provide "staff accounts" so that you aren\'t running an entire business\' POS system on the manager\'s phone only. You\'re competing with the likes of CBA Cardless Cash, ANZ Go Money, PayPass/Wave etc. etc. etc. The programming community keeps saying "yeah, but it\'s hard" / "it needs testing" / "etc.". Bullshit. If CBA and ANZ have figured it out, and have had it figured out for years - this just means that all the competent people are working for the banks, not bitcoin.  \n\n- You can\'t charge a 2% broker fee on top of a 3% spread (See CoinJar)\n\n- It is an open-source environment, which, micro-economically, means that competition is futile, and you WILL fail.

Well, if your company just focuses on processing transactions, or just brokering, or just *insert niche useless feature here*, your company is a failure right off the bat.

In reality, it is less, since not all blocks are completely filled with transactions (a block with 0 tx is not uncommon).\n\nIn order for Bitcoin to scale, we would need larger block sizes, smaller transactions or something similar.\nMaybe [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/2hchs0/scaling_bitcoin_gavin_begins_work_on_invertible/) will be more helpful.": 6, 'Each full node keeps a set of all blocks in the blockchain.\n \nCurrently this is well over 20 GB in size and climbing.  So block size impacts resources (bandwidth,  storage) that can be abused (and early on was being abused) thus a cap exists ... at a relatively arbitrary limit.\n\nTo pay for this bandwidth and storage either the fees paid need to increase or the number of transactions need to increase (like at least an order of magnitude).   Right now, the value of the coins the miners earn each block are a subsidy so that currently those transacting on the blockchain are essentially getting a "free ride".\n\nBut the current level of transaction activity is on the trajectory where it starts to approach the limit of 1Mb per block, so when that happens we will start seeing transactions being ignored (never included in a block) because the fee was insufficient.\n\nOf course a resource limit that causes increases in fees to be paid is, from  a user\'s perspective, bad.    But to increase the blocksize limit raises the bandwidth and storage costs, as well as introduces some other quirks (e.g., propagation time).\n\nIf the blocksize is not increased then there will be a period where approaches to full blocks will become reality (e.g., off-chain transactions.)  A countering argument is that these are  inconvenient alternatives at best and would hurt Bitcoin (slow whatever momentum it has been gaining).\n\nOne problem is that even if a Bitcoin core release introduces the change for higher block sizes (which involves a hard fork), there is no guarantee it would be implemented by the miners.\n\nSo, the tl:dr would be that there is some uncertainty as to how this topic (scalability) will play out.
