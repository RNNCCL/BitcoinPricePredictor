This control over money in case of banking accounts might look nice at the first sight, but the power gets easily misused/corrupted. Government can silence the voices of opposition just by forcing payment processors and banks to stop money flows to anybody they don't like (look how they were blocking Wikileaks). Too heavy regulation hinder innovation, etc.\n\nBitcoin is like a knife - very versatile and so very useful that it is widely used - so it is used also by nefarious people. It's hard/futile to try to improve knife so it cannot be used in wrongdoings.\n\nBitcoin is also very simple in a sense - so it can be used by anybody anywhere (like knifes can be made and used by anybody anywhere).

It can be a good thing to withhold information if someone wants to send to someone else. Well...depending on who you are and who the people are which want to communicate with each other. You have to admit, however, that the internet has begun to empower people in a way which was unthinkable before. I personally think it's a good think information can flow freely, the benefits outweigh the downsides. Same will be true for money.\n\nThe core issue is: If we say it is good to withhold money/information in some cases, who will we entrust this power to? How do we ensure the executive force acts as the majority would want it? Are these people representing us well? I think with Bitcoin we would have more power as people. If enough nodes and miners e.g. blacklist (don't giveme hate /r/bitcoin for using this word, and my node doesn't blacklist anyone ;-)) an address, we have a democratic process in which we decide.

I am not saying that our government is well-managed, or even good at its job. I am saying that there are some things that a free market may not be able to provide.\n\nThe latter part (i.e. some things markets just can\'t provide), is how I interpreted it.  \n\n>The highway system, for instance, would probably not exist. The same with GPS, and the space missions as a whole. TOR would have been at the very least significantly delayed.\n\nYou\'re right; the highway system (as it exists now) would probably not exist.  But then again, what would exist instead?  Or, what would society have done with that wealth that we spent on those highways (and in the one very particular way that government built and administered them)?  Or, what urban sprawl, congestion, and lack of more eco-friendly transportation networks would we have avoided had government not built out the highways?  Nothing in a careful study of the history of road building (long before it was a task considered solely the domain of governments) could lead one to believe that private roads and highways (built with various types of funding and for various incentives and purposes) are either an impossibility, or even unlikely.  They\'re not even a particularly (non-rivalrous, non-excludable) public good to provide, and history and theory also give us plenty of reason to trust in voluntary interactions (a.k.a. the market) to overcome these hurdles to production and to internalize negative externalities.  While the dreaded toll booth is very likely to be a part of some private highway infrastructure; the toll booth is by no means much more than a first world problem anyway (especially when considering the larger expense of government largess and overreach in lieu of being given roadbuilding power and coffers and eminent domain). . .and it is also a problem which technology has already provided ways of diffusing the inconveniences of anyway.  Again, not all roads and highways will need to be funded by toll booths.  [Here\'s](http://mises.org/sites/default/files/The%20Privatization%20of%20Roads%20and%20Highways_2.pdf) good read in that vein.\n\nGPS?  Again, maybe so. . . but I\'m going to again, suggest that you look at the world not as some inevitable outcome of a manifest destiny, where any event which took place is necessarily the best way history could have gone. . .but understand the issue of subjective value and opportunity costs (i.e., the [essence](http://mises.org/sites/default/files/Economic%20Calculation%20in%20the%20Socialist%20Commonwealth_Vol_2_3.pdf) of the problem of economic calculation).  I\'ll put it another way: how can we be certain that the funds and resources of society which went in to developing and deploying GPS satellites and creating the standards of the technology (especially when taken in consideration with the incalculable costs of the war machine which almost necessarily precluded it\'s development). . how can we know or be certain that this was the best use of society\'s scarce resources?  Without markets, we can\'t know.  And of course this goes for everything else the government does by way of taxation confiscation:  as useful and wonderful as a lot of this technology is, we can\'t know (though intuition and a simple look at the poverty of much more basic things around the globe should give us a clue) whether there was not a more productive use of those resources.  Only the price signals on a voluntary market can most accurately convey that information throughout the complexities of an economy, to end up with the least arbitrary arrangement of capital (physical, human, social, and all other forms of capital).  The U.S. or any other mixed economy doesn\'t have to be full-blown socialist, or nationalist or fascist or whatever, in order to suffer the inescapable consequences of the economic knowledge problem. . . the same forces which caused the soviet union to collapse and which make the black markets in North Korea the only reason why there are any living human souls left.  You might be very interested to look at some research from a [Terrence Kealy](http://www.amazon.com/The-Economic-Laws-Scientific-Research/dp/0312173067) who shows pretty clear empirical evidence to suggest that, while there are certainly short-run science and R&D capabilities which can be unleashed by a government (e.g. Russia beat the U.S. in manned space flight, and almost beat us to the moon, despite their relative poverty. . . because they poored all of their society\'s resources into it; the Egyptians built great pyramids, but doesn\'t say much about what that did to the living standard of the average person then), that in the long run; free markets tend to produce more basic and specific scientific research, and progress technology faster.  Don\'t ever forget that while DARPA "invented" the internet, and NASA advanced space flight:  both these agencies took almost everything they knew from previous private projects. . . (i.e. Goddard, parcnet and others) and also don\'t forget that we still can\'t know whether TCP/IP is the best use of the resources and R&D that went in to connecting computers on an open network.  There were other competing network protocols being developed privately at the time.  Who is to say that one of these other one\'s wouldn\'t have succeeded over TCP/IP, had it had the same advantage of gov\'t funding.  I often wonder whether people would say the same things about air flight (i.e. we wouldn\'t have air travel without government), if the Smithsonian institute, who were hot on the heels of the Wright Brothers, had successfully accomplished manned flight first.\n\nLet\'s not even forget to mention that we are right now on a forum dedicated to discussion of one of the most fantastic and useful technologies the world has seen for a long time; which is/was privately developed and funded, and which fills or is filling a complex societal service, which is something of a public good, and is succeeding. . . despite or in spite of governments persecuting it and incumbent industries trying to squash it.  Bitcoin is the embodiment of the type of solutions which markets produce, which render old problems obsolete, instead of worrying about finding archaic ways to regulate problems into submission.\n\n>For all its flaws, it seems to me that government is currently a good thing. \n\nAs you are probably beginning to see, the theoretical construct which leads me to hate the state, has very little to do with the present corruption or condition of politics, in the U.S. or any other nation-state. . . or some bad experience I had with the IRS.  I\'m not concerned with "good" cops/politicians/judges or "bad" ones.  They are all structurally and systematically perpetuating a bad system, regardless of how good their intentions may be.  It is not even about the technical merits or intelligence of those who oversee complex systems of centrally governed society.  The disagreement with all statist philosphies is primarily an economic one, and fundamental to the nature of value and role of prices and markets in society.

In fact, it's likely that some of the VC's urged Changetip to daytrade a modest fraction of the VC tranche because some of the VCs are likely to have expertise in daytrading, derivatives, fractional reserve investing, etc. themselves.\n\nAfter that, if I played it safe, it's all gravy. I would periodically pull profits into cold wallets (adding them to the principal I already took of the market) and use those to pay (1) the miner fees, if anyone actually withdraws their tips and (2) the VCs.
