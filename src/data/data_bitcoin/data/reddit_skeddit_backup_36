I think I've managed to decipher most of it, but it is written in a very sketchy and dense style.": 3, 'There are implementations of two protocols for efficient block transfer, both based on the ideas at https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/User:Gmaxwell/block_network_coding from a few years ago. \n\nOne of them is a simple extension to the existing P2P protocol with very low complexity, whos main focus is reducing bandwidth peaks. The other builds on top of it and requires UDP (and so is a little less applicable for general use due to NAT traversal), and tries to achieve the theoretical minimum latency all the time at the expense of some bandwidth.\n\nThe bandwidth minimizing one will likely be in production first as it\'s intentionally much similar and nearly done now. Both are specified to be "between full nodes only" and can relay blocks before performing more than chain-connectivity and proof-of-work validation, so they remove the verification delay from the relay process. Both are purely p2p protocol changes and do not change consensus, and don\'t need to be compatible across the network.\n\nNot all of the designed features are in the implementation yet; so it is a bit premature to discuss here; but since you asked...\n\nThere are three new data structures:\n\n1. A "comprblock", a block header, a nonce, one or more explicit transactions, and one or more "shortid"s which are 64-bit long values that are Hash(wtxid || nonce).\n\n2. A getblocktxn which is a list of variable length unsigned integers encoding differentially coded ordered indexes into a block. E.g. to select transactions with indexes 2,4,5,9 it would send 2,1,0,3. \n\n3. A blocktxn which is just a set of transactions selected by a getblocktxn.\n\nHere is an example, for a typical 1MB block.\n\nThere are two protocol flows...\n\nOne is the opportunistic mode:\n \n    [Before time: Sendcompr]\n    Sender                            Client\n    [Comprblock: 22kb] ->    \n        ---- Done!, if client knew all the not-included txn; else ----\n                                 <-      [getblocktxn: 100byes]\n     [blocktxn: 5k] ->\n        ---- Done! ----\n\nOne is non-opportunistic mode:\n\n    Sender                            Client\n    [Header: 80b] ->\n                                          <- [Getcomprblock]\n    [Comprblock: 22kb] ->    \n        ---- Done!, if client knew all the not-included txn; else ----\n                                 <-      [getblocktxn: 100byes]\n     [blocktxn: 5k] ->\n        ---- Done! ----\n\nIn either case a collision of the salted short-IDs would cause it to fail and fall back to an ordinary getblock. This is very rare, not triggerable by attackers, and would only impact single nodes and not the whole network at once.\n\nNormally a node would pick one peer to run in opportunistic mode-- based on whomever was previously fastest at relaying blocks--, and use the other mode for the rest.\n\nThe comprblock can contain transactions that the sender, at his option, predicted the far end did not have. Typically he\'d use whatever transactions surprised him and weren\'t INVed from the far side, which appears to be a very good predictor.\n\nCompared to other proposals:\n\n1. This efficient transfer protocol can transfer a large percentage of blocks in one-half round trip, this means much lower latency (though getting the absolute lowest latency all the time is not the goal of this scheme). This gives it the same best case latency as Matt\'s fast block transfer protocol, a bound not achieved by other schemes-- though it does require about 4x the data of Matt\'s protocol (e.g. 20kb vs 5kb for a typical large block), but avoids needing state synchronization between the two sides; which reduces memory usage and makes it more realistic to speak the protocol with many peers concurrently.\n\n2. It does not send a large bloom filter from receiver to sender. This makes it send considerably less data in total than other schemes (something like half the data in unlimited), and avoids problems with sizing the filter and causing additional delays when it is wrong-sized. It also does not allow clients to put large amounts of computational load on senders (e.g. bloom filter DOS attacks, as we\'ve suffered in the past with BIP37). Instead, the sender predicts what transactions the far end won\'t know without any real time remote advice. Most of the time it\'s right, if it\'s wrong then an extra round trip is required (making it take the same number of round trips as the unlimited _minimum_ case)\n\n3. The short IDs are made immune to collision attack by salting with a sender chosen nonce. Schemes which merely truncate the txid are vulnerable to being jammed in the network by arbitrary self-selecting attackers that do 2^32 hashing work ahead of time.\n[I had an earlier design that sent only 32 bit salted short-IDs and then additional error correction data to disambiguate collisions, but decided the implementation complexity wasn\'t worth it for the improvement which only amounted to 10kb]\n\n4. Uses very compact differential indexes to select missing transactions. This helps keep the overhead for things not-in-mempool to under 2% as opposed to 10%; and usually gets the request into a single packet which reduces the risk of delay increases due to packet loss. [Again, we have a more complex scheme that pretty much completely eliminates overhead but again, not worth the implementation complexity; right now this is stubbed out in the WIP implementation]\n\n5. The implementation will likely be much smaller and simpler when finished (especially for software which does not implement BIP37).\n\nIn testing this week, I\'m seeing a 96% reduction in block-bytes sent. Keep in mind [most network traffic by far is used by transaction relay](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1377345.0), which isn\'t changed by this. The main improvement this tool brings is the reduction of bandwidth peaks when blocks are found, and some \'free\' reduction in average block transfer latency. The bandwidth savings will matter more once various relay improvements are implemented.\n': 15, 'Much of what will be in 0.13 is already merged.': 8, 'This work was part of the core roadmap posted back in December; and it\'s a continuation of a line of public development that has been going on for years.\n\nSome other folks went off and worked on their own stuff. That\'s great: This isn\'t consensus normative, and it\'s fine for different implementations to different things.\n\nBut in my view their scheme has some limitations, many resulting from ignoring the work done so far: The shortid scheme it uses is vulnerable to maliciously created collisions, the use of bloom filters is complex and potentially resource intensive,  and the minimum transfer time is greater by the one way delay.  The total amount of data transferred is greater. These are the kind of limitations that arise from a lesser amount of collaboration.\n\nRight now this other scheme is deployed on no more than 150 nodes, which is deployment a new version of core would get in a day or two. Given that, I can\'t see a reason to go forward with a known inferior protocol just for "compatibility".\n\nMost significantly though is that the protocol without the discussed limitations is simpler.  Right now the pull-req to "classic" for the "unlimited" scheme is 8,149 lines; while the implementation of the work in core is currently 860 lines and doesn\'t require the BIP37 bloom filter code.\n': 1, 'No the "wip" UDP branch is though.

Simplicity is key, because the upside here is relatively modest (its a large improvement to a small portion of the total bandwidth). The work for core is also a building block for a low latency scheme that should achieve the best possible latency across all kinds of networks.': 7, 'Is this the stuff based on error-correcting codes?': 3}, ('Infoteria to Partner with Dragonfly Fintech', 0): {}, ('$1,000,000 to Bot Developers.

When you see a new transaction, this transaction will spend some bitcoins that were sent in a previous transaction. And that previous transaction will spend bitcoins sent in an even older transaction, etc. So the only way to know for sure whether any Bitcoin transaction is valid is if you\'ve downloaded and verified all of its ancestor transactions. (It\'s not necessary to *store* all of the ancestor transactions, but you have to download and verify them.) "Syncing" is downloading and verifying every on-chain Bitcoin transaction that\'s ever been done so that you are able to immediately verify all new transactions as they happen. When it says you\'re "X years behind", that means that you\'re in the process of downloading all transactions that occurred X years ago.\n\nLightweight wallets like Electrum don\'t do this, but then they can\'t be 100% sure that the transactions or blocks they deal with are actually valid. To a large degree, they trust some third-party to tell them what\'s correct. As a result, they have somewhat reduced security.\n\nMy recommendation is:\n\n* If you process Bitcoin payments automatically, then your automatic payment processing system really *must* use a full node. Otherwise the risk due to insecurity is too great.\n* If you\'re a business or an individual who uses Bitcoin a lot, you should set up one always-on full node (preferably on a server you physically control, not on a cloud server), and you should configure your lightweight wallets to talk exclusively to this full node. This will help Bitcoin and also improve your security.\n* Otherwise, a lightweight wallet is OK, though there\'s certainly nothing wrong with running a full node wallet if you want.

I think so.  And txin[0] must have only 1 item on the witness stack.  So the coinbase tx can\'t have much witness data; you\'d have to put it in a transaction.\n\nSo right there you\'ve got a 100-ish byte coinbase tx, most of which is non-witness.

If people use more multisig P2WSH it might get closer to 2MB.\n\nFrom a technical viewpoint, the size increase part is not an interesting / important aspect of the segwit changes.

The proceeds from the sale of this contract will be used in rural Kenya to buy one younger goat that will be placed with a smallholder farmer. The farmer raises the goat for six months and then earns a share of the profit (if any) when the goat is sold at the end of the contract. About 75% of the funds from the sale of this contract go towards procuring the goat, and the remaining 25% are allocated to the farmer for medicine/vet visits, water, feed, and for transport to a regional market for final sale. After the goat is sold at the market, profit will be calculated as the selling price minus $25 (the contract purchase price). The farmer keeps 60% of the profit and the remaining 40% of the profit (plus the $25 investment) is sent to the holder of the contract. The contract (tentatively) will be a colored coin asset, stored on the project's wallet though you can withdraw the coin to your own wallet if you wish. The coin can be sold/transferred before the contract-end if desired. [A different digital asset platform might be used instead, the space is developing rapidly.] Details on the Initial placement of the goat with the farmer (e.g., weight, measurement, ear tag ID, photo, farmer info & GPS location) and periodic updates will be made available via the project's web site. [Also, TBD] The aim for this endeavor is to help rural (upcountry) farmers make the jump from subsistence farming to becoming succesful, self-sufficient commercial farmers through assistance from the project's cooperative. The farmers selected to participate will have land, foliage, will be relatively near to a water source, and will have spare time -- though most already raise a farm animal or three. What they don't currently have is the capital to build a larger herd to raise. A herd with a higher head count (e.g., 25 to 40 goats on a farm) with many farmers in the cooperative gives economies of scale that make it possible to have regular scheduled visits from the vet, to provide livestock farm education/outreach, and to share resources (e.g., the lorry for transport to market), etc. The photos in this listing and profile are from Phase One of the project (started late 2014) in which 120 goats were placed with 5 farmers. Phase Two is being planned for a mid-2016 start, with the goal being to place 750 goats with 25 farmers. Contracts sold prior to June will be placed with existing Phase One farmers.

This would happen as marginal miners can\'t recover their variable costs.  But it takes two weeks for Bitcoin to adjust to the reduced hashing power.  If Bitcoin is subject to a spam attack at that time, bad things can happen.\n\nI\'ll grant that SegWit is less of a risk, simply because it\'ll be rolled out in stages across the network.  But the halving is network-wide and rather instantaneous.\n\nWhether the SEC cares about the halving or not is debatable.  The Bitcoin ETF will be the first digital asset ETF, and with all the "blockchain" hype on Wall St., I doubt the SEC wants to screw it up.   I\'d assume the SEC has some knowledgeable folks overseeing the ETF approval process.  This is certainly getting more scrutiny than a standard ETF release.\n\nBut I\'m not sure the SEC would have the power or desire to stop the issue simply because of the halving.  They may just require it be listed as a "Risk Factor".  \n\nBut I\'m pretty sure the issuer would wait until after the halving.

": 2, 'Losing memory?  \nYou already built almost the same thing...  \nhttps://www.theprotocol.tv/  \nhttps://www.theprotocol.tv/about-us/  ': 1, 'What is decentralized about this? ': 3, 'A little long, but here are my thoughts on the pay-for YouTube alternatives:\n\nThe concept excites me, but I just don\'t see it working as a simple pay to watch style service.  While many of the attempts leave something to be desired, this isn\'t the first time such a thing has come available.  Here\'s my thinking as to why this problem is neither easy nor simply a matter of getting a working platform out there.\n\nFirst, the idea of "reclaiming your time" is great in a marketing sense but that\'s not really what is happening.  If I have to break out a phone and fund a wallet, or setup an account login and password with a micropayment channel to the service just to use it... then you have already eliminated a *vast* majority of your audience straight out the gate.  When I go to read an article or watch a funny video that someone has posted, as soon as I hit play or start reading and that window comes up that says "Register to watch!" I\'m already out of there.  It\'s costing me my time and I\'m not going to do work or pay up front for something I have no idea if I\'m going to enjoy or not.  When I go to the theater it\'s a very different story, I\'m getting 2 hours of entertainment that has been summarized, has that actor I love, revealed a bunch of exciting clips, and has trailers and posters everywhere trying to convince me it is a good film and/or entice me with its genre, story, and style.  A YT video does not have this luxury, and neither does it get rewarded with my expectation of entertainment.  It is generally the opposite, I expect to find something mildly interesting that I will likely pass over after a short amount of time.  This is far more often the case.  I very well may start 20 lectures about different topics, watch a minute or so and skip on to the next until I find one that really grabs my attention.  I\'m gonna be really annoyed if that takes funding a wallet, setting up an account, and having to pay for every single portion of video that failed to entertain me.\n\nSecond, the network and content is everything.  There has to be a very enticing reason for content creators to post all of their content onto a new platform.  There needs to be a feedback loop between creators and consumers.  YouTube worked because it IS free and was from the very beginning.  Then the popular content and big content creators received payout from ads as the platform grew and content spread.  Ads that the user accepts generally on the basis of number of views, number of subscribers, and the fact that they can probably skip it after a few seconds.  They are given a "preview" of sorts regarding the value of what they are watching.  They are simply receiving it in the form of views and/or ratings.  This may be enough to get someone who *already* has an account and who has *already* funded a one-click wallet to watch the video, but you must have the views, the ratings, and the users *first* to show the value of the video or content in question.\n\nLastly, I\'ve tried every service that has made this attempt I\'ve stumbled upon so far.  Some have it easier than others. Xotika.tv for instance needs little more than a thumbnail to get someone to try the service (which I did for science.)  But keep in mind the user *still does **not** pay up front,* even with a far easier to market content type.  The user can start the video, chat, and use the service in a limited way while the content creator (in this case naked people) decides the amount of tips needed for certain desires of the user.  If this is something done with porn, regular content will need to do this two-fold to have a ghost of a chance.\n\n**My warnings and advice as a "professional user": **\n\nIF you are competing with YouTube, it MUST be free and ad-less to begin using.  No ifs, ands or buts about it.  If you want users, they should be able to go there, start browsing, watch a few videos, and try the service without registering, paying, or seeing ads.  Maybe a 5 free videos per day thing or something.  I don\'t think that is a very good solution to the problem, but it is a start.\n\nMy suggestion?  *Dont* be YouTube.  YouTube is YouTube *because* it is free.  Specializing the content, like with tutorials, or a specific type of media may create a different image in the users\' minds.  **Stop trying to be Yotube**.  Because you will always be the YouTube copy that costs more and doesn\'t have nearly the quantity or quality of content.\n\nI hope this works out and I am proven wrong.  But I think success may be found from narrowing the vision or goal to something that has real uniqueness in it. But I do not recommend trying to compete with a free service by making the equivalent in a paid service, decentralized at some point in the future or not.  I will try it, because I try all of them, but if I don\'t want to come back after my first experience, I probably won\'t.  The Internet is huge and there is an ocean of content demanding our attention. \n\n I sincerely hope this works out and I\'m excited to see more people putting their minds and hard work toward solving this problem.  I just want to give my two bitcent as someone who has been searching for the service that has that enticing idea, that unique monetizing system, or that completely changes how I thought about content creation.\n\n.\n.\nEdit:  **TL;DR** Would you have paid 10 cent to start reading this comment?

The average layperson will not buy bitcoin to join a network that not used by anyone, so to jump start LN we need the "sign up, it\'s free" Gmail-type LN client (which is possible while still giving the user control of the private keys of their channel) where I can sign in, and with 0 bitcoin on hand immediately start receiving bitcoin via LN.\n\nBut someone has to foot the bill and commit bitcoins to a channel with someone that is committing 0 bitcoins (which is a risk to lose the bitcoin fees entering and exiting the channel, so they\'ll need to thwart frivolous account creation moreso than Gmail does)\n\nOtherwise, all devices will have to be injected with bitcoin before being shipped or some crazy shit like that, because the only people buying bitcoin to join a pay-to-participate, spending limit extravaganza, are people like me.\n\nIf we want to talk pie in the sky, I\'d be more than happy to hear your take on the future of LN, but if we want to be realistic, large hubs are a necessity for LN.

When you hash real world data with a little bit of noise the hash is completely different from the hash of the same data without the noise. \n\nSo for fingerprint scanning they must store some kind of map of your fingerprint pattern and allow some kind of tolerance between the scanned print and the print on record. They couldn't store a hash since the recorded data must match exactly to reproduce the same hash, which is not realistic. So fingerprint scanners rely on a database of fingerprints, which could be hacked or stolen at somepoint.\n\nThis is the same case here. The brain scan database cannot simply hold a hash of your brain scan but some parameters which have tolerances.
