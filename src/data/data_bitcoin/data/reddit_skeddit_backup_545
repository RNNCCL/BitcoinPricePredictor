It took a minute or two for the machine to send the texts (sms) it needed to my cellphone, and the camera is placed a little too low so one has to crouch down a little so the face becomes visible on the picture. But aside from that it worked perfectly! The touchscreen was impressively exact fast and responsive so it went very fast to enter ones cellphone number. The bill detector device was a little slow and there was a tiny gap on the top of the device's hole that caused one of my bills to go into the machine, but then get bent and come out again through the receipt device's hole.\n\nThat only happened once for me, and was easily fixed by simply putting the bill in again at a slightly different angle. There didn't seem to be any risk for the bill to get stuck due to this tiny gap.\n\nI bought my bitcoin and the fee seemed to be correct (I assumed that the SEK/USD rate hadn't changed much in the last hour since last I checked it, and I verified the fee to be approximately 5 %). But I didn't think about that the daily limit was 3000 SEK for *both* buying and selling, and not just for buying. So I wasn't allowed to sell bitcoin for 100 SEK as I had planned. I'll just have to test the selling feature some other day instead. At least I now know that the limit function works as intended ;). The entrance door to the building was locked so I don't know if one is supposed to go inside by entering a door code or call someone through a door phone. I never got to reading any instructions about that because another person happened to be entering while I stood there so I simply followed that person to get in. The BTM had clear instructions on top of it and on it's monitor screen.\n\nThe verification (to raise the allowed daily limit currently from 500 SEK to 3000 SEK) process went fast as well (5-10 min) and there were chairs nearby to sit on while waiting for the verification text (sms) to arrive. The bitcoin I bought arrived nearly instantly, and I got a paper receipt with the blockchain transaction number and other details in case I'd ever need it.\n\ntldr: All in all experience 8/10 in my opinion (-1 for the very likely not dangerous tiny gap just above the bill detector device, and -1 for the way too low placement of the camera making me look like a fool in front of the curious receptionist as I was taking a picture of my face).": 5, 'Buy fee this week 3% / Sell fee this week 8%\nhttps://twitter.com/hashtag/BTMepicenter': 1, 'Exciting!

There is nothing to steal as long as you take care of your private keys. The blockchain allows secure storage/logging of important and personal information without the need to attach your private identity. The status quo system requires identity verification of all kinds because it is archaic, vague and vulnerable, which makes it a playground for criminals and authorities whose only task is to uphold the never-ending episode of Tom & Jerry. They do not see an alternative because they are completely immersed in the struggle against quotidian chaos, which happens to be bred and sustained by the status quo itself. Anyway, I think it's unnecessary to try to collect and securely store sensitive biometric data on every individual. The risk of identity theft could be much worse than ever before, especially if people create centralized data firms that store and sell sensitive biometric profiles of people off the blockchain. You don't need to use a palm print or retina scan to unlock a door, rent a car, or board a flight. A cryptographic ID key of some sort would suffice, but nobody would be issued or have in possession more than one key at any given moment. Although the key would not contain sensitive or personal data, anyone can easily reissue a new one at anytime if they feel like their security or privacy was compromised in any way. It could be issued in the form of a QR tattoo, a wireless read-only chip such as NFC embedded in your finger tip, or something else that has yet to be invented. Two or three of these combined would be better.\n\nIntrusive identity verification systems are highly demanded by the status quo because false documents are increasingly easier to make and exponentially harder to curb using old technologies/tactics. The blockchain eliminates counterfeiting, tampering or manipulating records, revealing and stealing sensitive/private information, leaks, hacks, etc. Thus, invasive ID technologies are unnecessary. If need be, they should only be utilized by entities that require special clearances, or special surveillance.

Lots of smart people provide pretty good answers but most don't realize what the person asking the question is really about to do.\n\nDO NOT import your current trezor wallet into Electrum. The moment you do that, you've lost all of the benefits of having a trezor to start with. Your private keys (which up until that point had been safely inside your trezor only and therefore effectively immune to keyloggers, PC malware, etc) will immediately be just as vulnerable as if you had never had a trezor to start with.\n\nCertainly doing an import like that is a (potentially) reasonable thing to do if you've lost your trezor or it has failed but it is not what the electrum people are talking about when they say they've added Trezor support. What is 'new' is that with the newest version of electrum and the appropriate plug ins, electrum can communicate with the trezor device directly (assuming you've configured it correctly and have the right plugins setup) without the need for the mytrezor website. So, when you want to make a transaction, you'd still use electrum but you'd always plug in your trezor when you wanted to send bitcoin.\n\nSo why is the community (generally) happy about electrum trezor support? - Well, before the feature was added, if the trezor company went away and mytrezor went away, you'd have no way to spend coin (sign transactions) in your wallet stored in the trezor without first importing that private key into a wallet on your computer (sort of like what it looks like you are getting ready to do). Not ideal, particularly if one has a very very large number of coins. The new feature means that loss of mytrezor does not force one to lose the security of the trezor device to access they wallet.\n": 4}, ('Coin Tumblers, Threshold KYC Exchanges, Local Coins...', 2): {"Decentralized, Open source & secure mixer, CoinJoin algo - keys never leave your computer (and you get paid if you provide liquidity):  \nCode & details here: https://github.com/chris-belcher/joinmarket/wiki  \nIts own subredit: https://www.reddit.com/r/joinmarket  \nLive orderbook (per today's numbers you can mix 50+ BTC in a single shot): http://joinmarket.io/\n": 2, '[deleted]': 1, 'No, this thread is not about wallets.': 1, 'That is fine, especially because coinjoin and other mutual forms are $free instead of costing BTC other than tx fee.\nBut there are other important ecosystem parts to be listed here than just wallets.': 1}, ('FT Predictions: the world in 2015 - Will this be the year that bitcoin and other crypto currencies collapse?', 2): {"> Prices have been floundering at around $350 a coin for months\n\nAnd yet a rise to $275 means we're on a rocketship": 1, 'Quite how someone can state "chances of zero" is beyond me.

I say 'probably' because if we replaced all SHA256 in Bitcoin with the old, weak, compromised MD5 algorithm, Bitcoin would still be secure today against all known MD5 attacks (because Bitcoin tends to hash everything twice).": 15, "If the price doesn't rise, will halvings be a problem?\n\nFrom my understanding, halvings were scheduled with the expectation that the price would keep rising enough to compensate miners for losing half the reward. If the price doesn't rise, then the hash rate would crash as mining becomes much less profitable. If Bitcoin doesn't become mainstream, and so the price remains low, will it handle the future halvings safely?": 1, "My theory was that if the halving has already been priced in because it's predictable, then it may not move the market at all when the halving happens. Therefore, the price would remain the same while the reward is half gone, which I thought would be a problem for the miners.\n\nHowever, it's been explained to me that equilibrium will be reached regardless, and that the miners and the network can handle it.": 1, "That's not true. \n\nIf the demand stays the same it will not have a big effect. The price will rise to compensate for the lack of supply...": 0, "Compromised how?\n\nIf it turns out shortcuts in the SHA256 algorithm are possible (getting to the same result by doing less calculations) then it's really not a huge problem for mining so long as the shortcut is public information.\n\nIn fact, (some rather limited mining-specific) shortcuts in SHA256 are possible right now and miners are actively using/abusing. It allows them to skip the last round in the calculation, gaining them a small performance boost. Net result: zero; so long as everyone's doing it the difficulty will adjust accordingly and nothing will change.\n\nIf the shortcut is more significant, allowing you to skip, say, 99% of the calculation and getting to the same result (which is ridiculous and I'd venture to say impossible) then, equivalently, the difficulty will shoot up, while the cost/work performed to satisfy that difficulty will remain the same: nothing happens.\n\nWe could literally mine with MD5, which is so broken it's barely more than cheese, and the system would work perfectly fine.\n\n----\n\nIf it's somehow possible to reverse a SHA256 hash to *an* origin value that happens to be a valid public key, (which seems far-fetched because there's an infinite number of origin values, it's generally, like significant shortcuts, considered impossible), it's probably wise to switch out SHA256 for some other digesting algorithm for address generation primarily, and for mining at lower priority. Reversing an address to its private key is, on top of SHA256, secured by RIPE-MD and ECDSA. So a compromised SHA256 doesn't mean a compromised address.\n\n----\n\nIn any case. SHA256 just turned 14 (years of age) and no real vulnerabilities have been discovered yet, which hasn't been for lack of trying. It looks to be a rock solid digesting algorithm.\n\nThe signature algorithm, ECDSA (secp256k1), is much more prone to compromise.": 2, 'Thanks!': 1, "Again, the price is determined by demand and supply.

As in, SHA256 becomes broken? I.E. anything you hash with it is predictable? \n\nI'm not sure I know a definition of compromised where that would really matter to miners. It's just work they have to do. In that regard, it may be difficult to design something that breaks a hash for block/transaction data. I doubt it would affect miner's at all.\n\nThe reason for the controversy over algorithm is specifically because of ASICs. Literally, on the physical hardware, SHA256 does not require any memory - it runs entirely through the processors. \n\nAlgorithms like Scrypt and X11 intentionally present problems for ASICs. Scrypt requires memory. If SHA256 looks like this:\n\n>SHA256(SHA256(Data)) \n\nThen Scrypt looks like this\n\n>SHA256(SHA256(Data) + something in memory)\n\nThis is not how it works, its simply to show Scrypt requires RAM. It takes time to store/retrieve and bus that data. Also, ASIC stands for Application Specific Integrated Circuit. They don't have memory, at least not much and those transfer read/write times affect hash rate, significantly.\n\nThe X11 Algo is a mixture of 11 algorithms and the ordering changes, so it's difficult to develop a fixed ASIC Chip that satisfies the permutations.\n\nSo none of this really relies on security. The security is a side affect of the properties of the algorithm. It's difficult to come up with even a scenario would a broken hash algorithm would hurt a cryptocurrency.

Equally everyone has a (in theory) equal opportunity to become a true full-node-operating miner, albeit subject to availability of ASICs, mining pools, and the cost of running a full node.\n\nIn short, I describe miners as collectively forming a trusted third party to hammer home the fact that unless the ability to become a miner is fairly widely distributed, and the actions of miners is subject to auditing via full nodes, we're just as fucked as we would be if we all used PayPal.

Yet they're still a trusted third party, we just have way to punish them after the fact to discourage them from abusing their trust.\n\nIn the same way miners are a trusted third party, and we have mechanisms built into the economic design of Bitcoin to strongly encourage them not to abuse that trust.

What of the fate of the "Satoshi fortune"? Isn\'t this kind of a wild card? What is the rational when a company like Microsoft stomachs this risk?\n\nOne of the benefits of not knowing the identify of Satoshi is that he can\'t be the face of bitcoin. The face of bitcoin is.. bitcoin. We don\'t have to worry what Satoshi\'s motives are because the code speaks for itself. The code cannot be used in a malicious way - it\'s not like Satoshi could have coded some secret backdoor, the code has been studied FAR too deeply for anything like that to exist. None of us know the fate of the Satoshi fortune and there is always a likelihood that he could cash that in one day. The rationale of any company that accepts this risk is that bitcoin is a game changer. It will change the world in the same way that credit cards and cell phones did... I predict that the world won\'t be radically different, but bitcoin will be recognized by the world as an obvious integration. \n\n\n> 2.) So, in the very first line of the Satoshi white paper, we have him saying Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer system, absent of a trusted third party. And at the closing of the expo today we have Peter Todd letting us know that miners are the trusted third party in this arrangement. I think I understand the context behind both of their reasonings, but since I\'m outside of the realm of technical expertise and programming language here, so I want to be damn sure I at least get the spoken language right.. Bitcoin seems like it has a lot of paradoxes going on... (transparency/privacy) (anonymity/pseudonymity), (scarcity/infinite divisibility), (tool of liberation;freedom/tool of oppression;surveillance), (miners can be decentralized/miners centralizing in China).... Anybody have any thought on these?\n\nMiners are not a trusted third party. They are untrusted just like every peer. They must prove the validity of their work in order for it to be accepted. I repeat, there are no trusted third parties in bitcoin. I\'m not sure what Peter was referring to, but I suspect this was a misunderstanding on your behalf. \n\nI don\'t find those things to be paradoxes. Bitcoin is transparent and private. There is no true anonymity and people shouldn\'t expect bitcoin to provide that. Scarcity and infinite divisibility are concepts that promote the success of a tool that exchanges wealth. Liberation, freedom, oppression, etc.. All of those are the work of philosophers. It seems that everyone who understands bitcoin seems imagine relative to their own political perspective.. bitcoin doesn\'t inherently address any of these. Why so much worry about China? If this were a purely US venture we wouldn\'t have the benefit of interacting with the rest of the world. Miners are bound to the rules of the protocol just like everyone else, no matter where they live. I know there are people who are smarter than I am who can shed more light, but that\'s what I know.\n\n>3.) What concerns are there if any regarding miner selectivity when deciding which transactions to include in a block? Is this a "nature will run it\'s course" kind of scenario? It seems like there would be plenty of room for miners to exhibit these exclusionary or calculated behaviors in the Bitcoin ecosystem.. In some sense, miners are free to do as the choose, so in a way this makes the system more "free". But at the same time couldn\'t this result in increased centralization? Isn\'t this just like our "free" market that currently exists, where Comcast is "free" to fuck us over so flawlessly? Or are we just truly in uncharted waters, and there is no way for anyone to know or even estimate? Peter Todd basically closed with, "There is no way know what will happen, or if these issues can/will propagate." I understand this statement at face value, because obviously he and others are not wizard psychic type cryptomon... But holy shit, this was such ominous way to close the expo! I just thought I\'d hear something a little more certain from one of the core devs.. Scary stuff.\n\nI sort of see where you\'re coming from, but as time goes on miners will be more and more dependent on transaction fees. Miners who wish to remain successful will have less willingness to refuse transactions that pay any transaction fee. Anyway, any valid transaction will eventually be picked up by a miner even if it\'s not immediate. These concerns are real, but there\'s plenty of time and space to resolve them, they are recognized challenges, not show stoppers.\n\n>4.) Or maybe a participant tries to inject 1 million 1 Satoshi transactions in an under an hour? How would the network react? Like some mad garage scientist secretly some franken super hashing monster, and storms the Bitcoin beach? (i know this is ridiculous) But seriously.. what if there were an army of bots trading or spamming or dusting the network.. What kind of moat does Bitcoin Castle have against someone(s) who wants to be a dick about it?\n\nThis has actually been attempted. The transactions were eventually recognized as dust and purged from the system. You might google for 1Sochi and 1Enjoy (I think those were the address names). Dust transactions that don\'t include a miner fee are easily discarded and don\'t pose any threat to the network.\n\n>5.) Can Bitcoin coexist along side future developments in quantum computing? Like SHA256 getting pwned somehow? Or couldn\'t we just incorporate this unlocked potential to build a kind of quantum capable blockchain. Super Shredder blockchain??\n\nQuantum computing doesn\'t pose a threat to bitcoin because the protocol can be changed as needed. As soon as someone recognizes a threat from quantum computing (or any technology) the network can respond by improving the algorithm and updating the protocol. Let\'s say some really bad actor pulls off a well planned attack one day in the future - It might disrupt a day of exchanges and there may be clean up to do, but it won\'t disrupt the ledger that has faithfully stored the balance of every wallet. \n\nSome of these answers are incomplete and off the cuff.. you asked a lot and I don\'t know everything. I may update/edit if I see something I could improve.\n\nI think I hear a lot of people saying, "What if?" like.. what if SHA256, ECSDA, or RIPEMD-160 are compromised? Well, that\'s very possible, but crypto is always advancing and bitcoin isn\'t etched in stone. There\'s a strong team and a lot of vested interest in seeing these challenges coming and addressing them. If any of these mechanisms are compromised it will be a world changing event, not just something that affects bitcoin.\n': 16, '> But ultimately, yeah, a big enough "Joker" actor can destroy Bitcoin.\n\nNot exactly. A big enough attacker can cause significant disruption to the Bitcoin network, for a time. It\'s not really possible to destroy a protocol.\n\nBitcoin works by a careful balance of incentives, game theory, and monetary principles. It\'s the last item that is in many ways, to me at least, the trickiest, because any successful currency requires a degree of confidence in its value, which is where most damage could occur. \n\nBitcoin gains confidence from its properties and expectation of secure transactions. Since arbitration in Bitcoin is determined by majority of hash power (to present proof-of-work) an attacker with adequate resources could cause trouble, but as you know can\'t do *anything*.\n\nTo say Bitcoin would succumb to a hash power attack is to accurately call in advance the reaction of the entire market, the community, and futility of all defensive countermeasures which might be deployed, over time.

There is no amplification in this sampling, so long as they censor few enough things you need a huge amount of sampling to catch them, and there is no consequence for them in being caught. Lets say that they\'re censoring any payment to you, specifically, over 10 BTC. Whats the chance that any random block you select has such a payment in it?\n\nSo first of all, you can ask two different nodes, and they would have to censor in exactly the same way. But let\'s take your example. I chose two recent blocks at random. https://blockchain.info/block/00000000000000000be7e165a550e051354d32c34922e075c215a778136448ec and https://blockchain.info/block/00000000000000000076ef0e7fbbac8f1e967f68cfe218ce98ac2074b121ae17.\n\nI see one unspent 10btc https://blockchain.info/tx/f3031082aa194abb773a4ca24e3c63523773242f23442c3e5b6895081887f4cf, so far. It was around 15% in, so probably there are at least a couple more. Let\'s check the other block: https://blockchain.info/tx/6dd22ae520a844b8d17f80b429b0cdb12c564b7577700546bdb15a0f22bd9ca9, as of now, also around 15% through. \n\nThis may be due to the blocks being recent. I\'m going to check one from 6 months ago as a check on that. 320000, at https://blockchain.info/block/000000000000000015aab005b28a326ade60f07515c33517ea5cb598f28fb7ea, seems a good try.

So it looks like your particular example of blocking 10btc transactions wouldn\'t work. The questions are, how often could they block without you noticing? What percentage can be guaranteed to be included probabilistically? How much overhead is needed for this verification?\n\nAs for consequences: if the nodes had to sign responses to queries, then if you could prove they lied, they\'d have a problem. What if you could somehow penalize them, say if the data they give is wrong, then they automatically lose coins from their accounts, smart contracts or something, then the user could verify that the node they spoke to has some balance in their account (hm. Not sure how they could verify that, unless the coins need to be locked up? We don\'t want to discourage full nodes, though, so honest ones shouldn\'t lose.) Another problem would be that running a full node would not be immune from hacks, because you could lose money if someone made such "promises" in your name.\n\nIncidentally, there was a proposal somewhere to add a hash of the unspent transactions to the blocks, in which case my idea here would be much more workable obviously.\n\nI\'m wondering now if there\'s a way to generate "consensus" among nodes without the complete blockchain. All we really need is for me to know what the consensus of the unspent tx hash is.\n\n>Great, that is completely orthogonal. A full node only needs currently <1 GB storage.

To the extent that they do provide privacy the resulting privacy is very fragile and can be broken by future filter-sets or additional information (like constraints from change, taint analysis, or timing correlation).\n\nThe best thing to do would be to use PIR (private information retrieval) to receive the data.  No one has implemented any complex 'efficient' PIR schemes for retrieving wallet data as far as I know, but there is a simple scheme-- download all the data, which is used by Bitcoin Core. This also strongly protects against some other attacks which are harder to defend against in a SPV model.\n": 23, "> or when you need to restrict access to the database (e.g. to find out of your date shares the same fetishes as you, you don't want them privately enumerating all possible fetishes just to check against a full database they received from you. :) ).\n\nI'm not sure I follow this example.\n\n>Depends on what the user is expecting a wallet to do.

Your honest mistake is indistinguishable from fraud.).\nA middle ground, e.g. only display transactions for the last month, might make sense, and might be more reasonable... though even that still causes crazy failure modes if the user happens to run two copies of the same wallet.\n\nSo I'm making the assumption here that we're only using the private key in a single location. If that's the case, then any outgoing transactions will already be stored in history, and any incoming ones will be unspent, so only fetching a list of new unspent outputs since last sync would ensure you have everything.\n\nThe first time you connect you have no transactions to speak of, because you just created the address. So you only need to find out about new transactions sent to that address after that date, which will all be unspent because you didn't know about them yet. This takes up much less space and bandwidth than the whole blockchain.\n\nIf you want to import addresses with history, presumably you have the history already from wherever you previously used it.\n\nIf you want to use the same addresses on multiple computers, you could have a record of transactions, which get sent from one to the other. They would be linked then, but if it's encrypted interceptors still wouldn't know which addresses they represent.

So the only places where it makes sense are cases where communication is very costly (e.g. satellite perhaps) or when you need to restrict access to the database (e.g. to find out of your date shares the same fetishes as you, you don't want them privately enumerating all possible fetishes just to check against a full database they received from you. :) ).\n\nInformation theoretic PIR-- the kind that requires multiple server and assumes no more than a threshold will collude-- is quite a bit more reasonable and has fast implementations of the primitives available (percy++).

One of those things you can find internet things on. Yeah, do a quick google search for Bitcoin discounts, perhaps add a term if your feeling a little crazy today.  What  you will find is plenty of retailers offering 10% + discounts for bitcoin payments, which would insinuate that bitcoin is 10% cheaper or more, if you do you homework. I am broke, but I shop alot online, Bitcoin has saved me LOTS of money, especially purchasing eVape products.  Your buy sell costs included, none of these fees come to over 10%, or close for trading fiat for BTC over an exchange. All fees included, plenty of savings if you look.   Some people have disposable money, and do not care about savings. Others do, and have more time to look for savings. Realize, not everyone thinks, spends and works like you do.   \n     \n2. What volatility?  I have relatively little money, but when I wish to purchase / use bitcoin, I goto one of many exchanges, swap for BTC and in 2 minutes, I have what I need to do what I was doing.   The subjection to volatility is again, a personal fundamental.  I have never stored bitcoin for long timeframes, and have never lost or gained lots on volatility.  Not all people are storing bitcoin, please consider people\'s personal uses for bitocin and not your picture of what EVERYONE does with it.    \n  \n3.  You can look at it as limiting yourself to businesses accepting bitcoin or capitalize on the benefits provided by busnesses accepting bitcoin.  There is a half full and half empty cup, which one did you choose? Pretty obvious.\n  \n  \nIt\'s unfortunate that you take such a radical stance on bitcoin.  There can be a payoff, it depends who you are and how you view the situation, what is iportant to you in purchases etc.  It\'s going to be different for every income, class, and you clearly cannot impose your judgements on a bitcoin holder as a whole.    \n  \nLikewise, your view seems to come from the point of someone who has decided to throw fiat away and only use bitcoin.. Which is not recommended, the case, ever discussed, or any part of any conversation.   Nobody has ever suggested solely carrying bitcoin...   it is an alternative.   \n   \nNow, to me continuing to shove Bitcoin down my friends throats...Are you a party of my circle? You understand how i approach my associates?  You\'ve heard our conversations? I will ignore your naive idiocy. You have no idea how i communicate with my social circle, will never understand it, and my frined you think you know a whole lot more then you do.

However, it is very good as a store of value.\n\nWhat we want, and what we expect to happen is more user adoption within time. Also we can predict the amount of bitcoins in the future. Together with the above criteria we encounter a paradox. When bitcoins behave deflationary, people tend not to spend them, when you don\'t spend them then it is not a currency, and when it is not a currency the value would drop. But that would cause it to become inflationary. We have two competing forces here, but we assume that deflation will win in the end.\n\nIn reality there are no paradoxes. Therefore there must be something that combines both those trends. This is in fact what we see with the so called "bubbles". The interesting part however is not the spice, but the following slow decline. This is the time people spend their bitcoins and use it as a currency. Then the opposite happens, store-of-value slowly takes over and leads to an exponential growth that will lead to another "bubble", and so on.

They will ping your issuer (read: bank) to get an approval if the card is valid. Your bank at this point can accept/deny/or challenge the request where they can request more information from you either by having to call in to have the card added for Apple pay, or to download their app and sign in with your online banking credentials in order to approve the card for Apple pay.\n\nOnce your bank has given the approval to Apple, they will send over your device account number (16 digit virtual credit card number) and the key generator used to generate the valid one time use codes.\n\nFrom this point on everything is between you and your bank. Apple does not facilitate any transactions from this point onward. In fact, you can use Apple pay without an internet connection. The Apple watch will be able to do this without having your phone next to you.\n\nThe problem here is due to the fact that banks do not have good security practices when approving the card to be added for Apple pay.

": -4, "Thanks for elaborating! /u/changetip 1 upvote.\n\nSorry for misconstruing your SOL point.\n\nI recently did read some articles about a retailer fending off fraud. Things like if it's from out of the country, that's a big flag. They always check the address if it's a PO box, another big flag. If they request to get it shipped today or within 1 day, as normal as it may sound, that's a flag, as usually they want to make multiple orders and have it all get processed before the owner reports fraud and the card gets shut down. Very large orders from people who hadn't placed an order before, another flag, especially if they're low-volume (e.g. just 1 or 2 items) of an extremely high priced item. Different shipping from payment address is a flag (especially if they're in entirely different cities let alone countries).\n\nCombining these flags in an automated process, together with cross-referencing it with historical data gives pretty nice protection. But that's simply either not feasible technologically for small retailers, or they're so small you usually have no data to cross-reference with. And it's true, the retailer is 'responsible', and so there's no gigantic incentive for the payment processors to completely take on this flagging process although they do in part.\n\nDoesn't protect you from friendly chargebacks, either. Those are just the worst. Fortunately we're now seeing more tools and partnerships with shipping services to make it very easy to prove delivery.": 1, "> Nice Apple, relying on a 9 digit ssn.\n\nWhat on earth are you talking about? The full credit card numbers were already stolen, and Apple isn't the one who verifies customers; the banks verify their own customers according to their own rules. They can take on the risk for fraud themselves in an attempt to make things easier for their customers. It's a business decision ... and still has nothing to do with Apple. ": 0, "A retailer buys for $90, sells for $100, he has $3 in CC fees. He keeps $7. Retailers that sell food operate on a little over a 1% profit margin, so of the $7 he has $6 of other costs.\n\nNow imagine that he and all of competitor retailers have 1% in chargeback fraud costs. If they want to keep their 1% profit margin, as they all do, he'll have no other option but to increase their price by 1%.\n\nSo the customer now pays 1% extra. So when the CC company says 'you're insured if your card gets stolen', they actually mean 'you're paying the costs of theft, whether it was your card or someone else's, hell even if you don't have a card, through in-store prices'. That is, on top of the $50 of liability you have one way or another even if HomeDepot got fucked and you couldn't do anything about it. Customers always pay.\n\nGreat system. This goes for all other fees that the retailer has for payment processing, too, like the 3% fees, customers pay, too, it's just hidden. \n\nSo now that we know customers are paying for all processing and theft (which is obvious, of course), let's design a system where you have billions of plastic cards with their password written on them. Hugely insecure design which has generated many billions in fraud and affects millions of people. It's like cars came without locks, and we all pay for the cost of theft through increased insurance premiums for all, it's crazy.\n\nThen consider that 30-50% of chargeback fraud is 'friendly', i.e. not a stolen card but people scamming retailers with their own card, and consider again that this means that the retailer loses money and must increase prices for the rest, or litigate (which often costs them more than winning is worth) and generally increase prices to make up for those costs, and it becomes a bit of a perverse system.\n\nNot saying it's the worst system in the world, I happily own a credit card. Just saying there are genuine flaws with credit cards that Apple Pay either won't solve at all, or won't solve for many years to come.\n\nAs for the SOL comment, I'll ignore it. It's just silly. We can't hold people accountable for all the bad things others do unto them. This applies much broader to topics beyond theft, like rape.

(Stick with me; the physics lesson is almost over.)Given that k = 1.38\xc3\x9710-16 erg/\xc2\xb0Kelvin, and that the ambient temperature of the universe is 3.2\xc2\xb0Kelvin, an ideal computer running at 3.2\xc2\xb0K would consume 4.4\xc3\x9710-16 ergs every time it set or cleared a bit. To run a computer any colder than the cosmic background radiation would require extra energy to run a heat pump.Now, the annual energy output of our sun is about 1.21\xc3\x971041 ergs. This is enough to power about 2.7\xc3\x971056 single bit changes on our ideal computer; enough state changes to put a 187-bit counter through all its values.

In a (admittedly still hypothetical) future where Bitcoin is in common use around the world, banks and ATMs will be unnecessary, and the fees they charge will disappear; merchants will not have to keep change in the change drawers, as every transaction will be in exact change; there will be no high exchange rates charged by credit card companies (presumably in a future where Bitcoin is in common use, all prices would be denominated in Bitcoin); and there would be no need to exchange back to a local currency after returning home, since we would all use the same currency, so there would be no wasted money left over after a trip.\n\nLike I said, this is still a hypothetical future, but I believe it is the future the OP would like to see based on his experience travelling in Belize.
