As any game company we will continuously try to drive new sales.\n\nThere is one thing though if you take example of Magic the Gathering for example (first trading card game ever) they print new cards every 3 months. Some are new and some are close to the ones who existed. But they never reprint the exact same as an older edition. It's important for them the keep a balance between offering game experience and drive a scarcity that will make people invest in the new cards while they are still on the sale market.\n\nBut if they where continuously reissuing the same card again and again people wound't buy them. Because first they already own them and second they will lose fate their collection value will increase. At the very beginning of the game there where not many card printed (small market) and even cards very similar to a newer one will have more value because of it's scarcity. And not to say some reached incredible value.\n\nSo our policy is to continuously drive new sales by creating new and worthy content. Our ability to keep people excited and buying will have the positive side effect of increasing the value of BitCrystals main vector of card acquisition.\nSo we won't  re-released, with a new CounterParty token unless a distinctive sign has changed.

I would hope for cryptocurrency crowdfunds to try and move in that direction, but it doesn\'t have to start with yours, I can accept a trust element when this concept is still in the experimental stages. I am considering buying some simply because experimenting with the idea of cryptocurrency for holding a stake in a project is worthwhile.\n\nI have heard the "it will kill the product and our reputation" argument in so many video game kickstarters before. It hasn\'t stopped crowdfunded games from shitting on their customers and abandoning the project.

But then - I don\'t see why they need to care so much about irreversability of transactions if they are relying on trust.\n\nYep. \n\n>But having said that - settlement finality is apparently an important feature enshrined in LAW aimed at the reduction of systemic risk in financial institutions - so the removal of the delete feature is not about efficiency, but about enshrining in code the requirements of this law.  \n\nHow does a centralized blockchain do this better than a distributed database with backups or versioning? Why is it desirable to implement experimental new technology merely to comply with the law? Can you think of any other instances in which banks voluntarily did this? \n\nDoes a centralized blockchain *really* get rid of the delete feature? Seems to me that the "witness" could not only obstruct "settlement finality" indefinitely; they could also alter any past transactions and start "mining" on the altered chain. Any nodes not in agreement with the witness would be in an invalid state.

So the fact that r/Bitcoin appears to be "not engaging adequately" or circlejerking isn\'t necessarily an indication that everyone else is wrong. It may simply be an indication that *you* need to educate yourself. \n\nThe real reason why the "blockchain good, bitcoin bad" arguments are definitely hogwash is that [they were made up by marketers for banks researching bitcoin, in order not to scare people away](http://www.campaignlive.co.uk/article/1356964/bitcoin-barclays-ebola-banking-palatable). \n\nRelevant quotation:\n\n>Even Barclays won\xe2\x80\x99t exactly admit that it\xe2\x80\x99s exploring bitcoin,\xc2\xa0instead stating\xc2\xa0that it was looking at "blockchain technologies".

So please do not misunderstand that I am lumping you in categorically with a broad stroke of ignorance and offhandedness. \n\nHowever, I did question you about a few things as I mainly see certain financial institutions immediately recognize bitcoin\'s ability to disrupt certain (not all) aspects of their core business. When you extrapolate the technology many years down the line, it doesn\'t take a tremendous leap of faith to assume that all manner of incredibly disruptive and radical new fintech innovations will arise in this space specifically due to the open, not closed nature of bitcoin. \n\nI simply see bitcoin as an enormous enabler of this kind of innovation. I see closed ledgers as a way to bastardize the blockchain idea into a closed walled garden the likes of which Apple, inc. would probably drool all over. The itunes of finance, it you will. This is reprehensible to me in many ways because this mentality is that of a usurper, in which the banking industry would likely view any disruption as a threat and address it ferociously. That offends me. Anything that closes me off from the value of my work offends me. I store a shitload of work in the fiat notes that reside, digitally, in ledger my bank keeps. I\'d much rather that be open, and transparent than closed off, subject to a kill switch that the bank itself controls. This, in my view, is the highly dystopic end-game of closed ledgers. Control, power, and ultimatly, abuse. Not because the ledgers themselves, promote this, rather, that the ledgers\' protocols still endow trust with certain high-level actors whose politics, morality, notions of control, etc., may differ from mine. \n\nI also agree that we need to have a reasoned, yet impassioned debate on these technologies, and that we should welcome dissent and argument. I am not trying to shut you down, rather, I am relatively passionate about fostering technologies which can promote innovation and human evolution globally, as well as locally. Inclusivity in a financial sense, the likes of which bitcoin readily can (and does) enable rather than reverting back to some iteration of the blockchain tech that is ultimately another method of financial repression and an extention of state control. \n\nRemember Nic Cary\'s [quote](https://youtu.be/wh2svGAdy3c?t=36) (blockchain.info)? \n\nHe was at the bitcoin world conference in Vegas in \'14 sitting behind several credit union high level execs and CEOs and they said, "These guys don\'t know the true meaning of the word evil till we fuck them".

Banks suck: they take commissions on everything and they have power over your account. Essentially they are organizations which follow their own interest (which is understandable). They are run by men and they have the power to take your money (which they do in most of the transactions).\nWith bitcoins, we don\xc2\xb4t need them anymore to validate transactions. We can validate transactions on our own for free (nearly) and globally within minutes. \n\n2) Bitcoin is like the Internet. With Internet, we democratized content. Before we had publishers who had power over content, now we are all more free. With Bitcoin, we are democratizing value. Before we had banks who had power over value, now we are all more free. No central authority means a lot more freedom. Internet gave us Reddit, Facebook and Youtube. Who would have said that there in 1994? In the same way, we cannot imagine what will happen if we democratize monetary value. We can only imagine it will be a better world.\n\n3) Bitcoin will succeed because it is actually more convenient.

Bitcoin is an interesting idea, but the fact that it ultimately depends on humans to behave rationally precludes it from being the "cure" for our "defective" existing monetary system. at best, it will just become Yet Another currency, and at worst, a whole bunch of people are going to feel silly and betrayed (but will have only their greed to blame). the worst part of Bitcoin is its culture, and there\'s no solution to that.\n\nif people want actual QOL improvement in these lazy times, it will take the public demanding accountability first of its government, and then, with the help of government, its corporations. funny thing, though: if someone has stocks in Fooco, are they really going to demand that Fooco execs become financially, ecologically, etc responsible at the risk of lost profits and lowered imaginary stock values to that very shareholder? not bloody likely. ;-)\n\ni\'m not trying to bring a fart to the party, but when you look into how large scale systems of human behavior work, you realize it\'s very rarely the tool that\'s at fault, and almost always the user. so in the end, quality education is still the best hope we have for improving anything.': 3, "Depending on how important you feel it is to convert a non-believer, you might spend some real money.

First, fiat\'s value doesn\'t derive from our "belief" it derives from prison cells and guns.  You **must** pay your taxes in fiat or you go to jail.  It doesn\'t matter if you have a mountain have bitcoin and gold and real estate, if you have no dollars come tax day, you go to prison.  \n\nSecond, you can\'t really talk about bitcoin having an advantage in the fraud department, when a much larger percentage of bitcoin transactions are fraudulent today than credit card transactions.  Between Mt. Gox and smaller exchange thefts and cryptolocker ransomware, plus simple mistakes that many users make that result in bitcoins being lost forever (like USB drives becoming corrupted over time), credit card transactions are currently much more secure in practice than BTC.  \n\nAlso, bitcoin can\'t be sent instantly.  For example, during the spam attack, it took more than 24 hours for my transfer of 5 BTC to be completed, despite the fact that I had a $0.05 fee attached.  Even when things are working fine, it usually takes at least 10+ minutes for a single confirmation, and zero-confirmation transactions are not secure and have frequently been reversed in the past.': 2, 'I think I would giggle like a child if an employer (I do side jobs for cash) asked me if I wanted to be paid in bitcoin. Wow. ': 1, 'I think you hit the very core of the point, which is managing the risk in credit. While Bitcoin mitigates the risk in transactions, it does not mitigate the risk in credit. Mitigating the risk in transactions is a lot easier because in the very essence we are talking about validating numbers, which is a quantitative task which can be performed by a scalable algorithm + people with the right incentive. Mitigating the risk for a credit is more complicated as it involves an evaluation of the borrower (is he reliable?), which is (partially) a qualitative task which is hard to scale as it requires human beings with a certain level of specializazion. \n\nNow, given that I share also your assumptions about human beings (naturally greedy and on average not sufficiently educated to take complicated decisions) and about bitcoin (it is more likely to become a complementary rather than an alternative currency), it would seem impossible to create a new financial system. \n\nHowever, my belief is still that the credit system will change. Why? Because the conditions will change. Essentially I believe that there will be new technologies to assess risk in a more scalable way + different purchasing behavior + different saving behavior. \n\nNow, let me make few examples: ShoCard is a startup storing your identity card in the blockchain, so you can prove it online, Proofexistence does the same with your documents and there is a huge number of startups building applications on the blockchain. They are not there yet but my expectation is that we\xc2\xb4ll get to the point that decentralized apps will provide us with sufficient data to answer to the question: how reliable is giving credit to X? Given that we\xc2\xb4ll get to this level of data, there will still be an evaluation to be done. I am not sure who will do it and how.\nI share with you, it probably won\xc2\xb4t be a mass of people (as bitcoin mining is not for the mass). But I would not be surprised if it would be done by a good algorithm + specialized people which gather funds. So, although we might get rid of banks, we will still need people with a background in finance ;)\n\nAt the same time, due to scarcer resources and increasing demand, our purchasing behavior is changing: now the sharing economy hits only few goods, but it seems like millennials do not want to buy houses or cars. They value more freedom (because a loan is a commitment). So in the future, people might take way less loans: houses and cars might be more shared than purchased. Requesting lower amounts in loans, it will make borrowing less risky.\n\nBy mixing these 3 tendencies (better technologies to assess risk + less need for big loans + people increasingly depositing savings in bitcoins), I think there will be a point when banks will end up trying to catch up with new more efficient services in giving loans (pretty much as it happened to hotels with Airbnb and to taxies with Uber). As it is a powerful (and smart) lobby, it won\xc2\xb4t be easy though. Will this cure the world? Not sure, because, as you mentioned, the fault is almost always of the user and we won\xc2\xb4t suddenly become a lovely educated community. But still it will be a bit better world and it will be fun to watch it happening ;)\n\nSaid this, in my first comment I wrote that we don\xc2\xb4t need banks anymore.

The fact that is was relatively unreactive (store of value) combined with the fact that it is rare and easy to identify (authenticatability). Yet when compared with bitcoin, gold pales in all categories that define a currency. Bitcoin can be broken down to 8 decimal points (unit of account), sent instantly without fees to anyone in the world via the web (medium of exchange). It can be stored for time indefinite should the internet continue to exist (store of value). It is mathematically impossible to counterfeit (authenticatability) and also the act of "mining" gold produces no additional value while "mining" bitcoins helps propagate the network. \n\nThat\'s an issue if you expect that mass adoption will come: you can\'t just say "oh, people don\'t understand Bitcoin has intrinsic value".

For many people, the only way to get onto the Bitcoin highway is to transfer over from the fiat one, so credit cards become that junction that facilities a transfer from one to the other. Your typical use of a credit card has you using roads wrapped inside the fiat system, whereas now the credit card becomes the tool that allows you to exit that network of roads and merge onto an entirely new system of roads/highways that were previously inaccessible.\n\nThe other two ways you could get onto this new system of roads would be to work on it (start mining and securing the Bitcoin network) or to start accepting bitcoin in exchange for goods/services which you offer.\n\n> what is a block chain\n\nIn the most simple terms, it's nothing more than a very large, long ledger of all transactions that occur within the Bitcoin network.

There are different wallets, some are great, some not so much, but their purpose is to assist in the control of your bitcoin. Some make it easy to spend on the fly, whereas other wallets are moreso used for high-level security. A lot of people use two wallets, one on their phone for daily use and another (such as a trezor) for storing safely. No bank, person or government can get ahold of your wallet without some assistance from you. They would need to either physically force you or gain access to your computer/phone and hack into it. So it's not bullet-proof in the sense of security, you can still get hacked or lose your bitcoin if you're not careful. But compared to centralized banking systems of today, the state is in a tough spot of enforcing or controlling the Bitcoin network. The resources required for the state to try to enforce something on the Bitcoin network would far exceed whatever return they hoped for in regards to any single person.\n\nJust some thoughts.

I\'m not so sure.\n\nThe outcome is clear: the longest chain lost, contradicting one of Bitcoin\'s most deeply-engrained principles. The cost of breaking this rule may come in the form of reduced censorship-resistance at some point in the future, a point the article doesn\'t account for.\n\nThe article doesn\'t really talk about what caused the split in the first place. This is important, because it\'s one way to arrive at the "right answer."\n\nBIP 50 describes the problem in a nutshell:\n\n>This [the chain split] would be an issue even if the entire network was running version 0.7.2. It is theoretically possible for one 0.7.2 node to create a block that others are unable to validate, or for 0.7.2 nodes to create block re-orgs that peers cannot validate, because the contents of each node\'s blkindex.dat database is not identical, and the number of locks required depends on the exact arrangement of the blkindex.dat on disk (locks are acquired per-page).\n\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0050.mediawiki\n\nIn other words, pre-0.8 nodes had a bug that caused them to generate blocks that other pre-0.8 nodes couldn\'t validate. The 0.8 update wasn\'t the cause.\n\nIn comments buried on a thread from many months ago, Peter Todd and Greg Maxwell confirmed that the behavior was non-deterministic:\n\n>Like I said, it [pre-0.8] accepted the block, but non-deterministically - some nodes accepted, others rejected, and some nodes would accept the block if restarted, etc. Consensus systems simply can\'t be non-deterministic and still function, which is why I say Bitcoin Core was broken.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/2s2utx/the_hard_fork_missile_crisis/cnlt86s\n\n>Yep, as Peter Todd says... Two chains formed but it had nothing to do with Bitcoin 0.8 and would have happened more or less the same without it.\n>\n>The triggering event was one of the large pools changing their own software to produce larger blocks and a reorg happened related to those blocks. Initially we thought that the problem was 0.8 accepted pre 0.8 rejected. But the reality was that most pre-0.8 also accepted, some did not, non-deterministically.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/2s2utx/the_hard_fork_missile_crisis/cnly7lb\n\nIf I\'m reading this all correctly, the "right answer" was to lead users who were running software without a bug to begin running software with that bug. Not only that, but to kill the longest chain in the process through an out-of-band channel. It\'s clear that those involved acted in good faith, but may not have fully understood the root cause.\n\nWith these points in mind, the author\'s claim that the "right answer" was implemented seems harder to judge. If the pre-0.8 chain split behavior was really non-deterministic, it seems plausible that the shorter branch would have lost support on its own - without any intervention, as Vitalik suggests.': 1, "Very interesting play-by-play.  \n\nEvery time there's a fork, this is a centralizing force.

Otherwise there will be no clear path for responding to future events like this one.\n\nI appreciate the part about exposing users to the least amount of irrecoverable loss, but the next event may present a situation in which that call can't be made with any certainty, so other standards may need to be used. I'm curious what they might be.": 1, '>  the longest chain lost, contradicting one of Bitcoin\'s most deeply-engrained principles\n\nI strongly disagree.   The rule implemented in the Bitcoin system from day one is that the longest _valid_ chain wins. A chain which is invalid-- say one that mines an extra cool million Bitcoin out of thin air to share among miners-- is not selected no matter how long it is; and this is essential to upholding the incentive structures of the system.\n\nIn this case chain that lost there was invalid from the perspective of a significant portion of the participants in the system.  The chain that survived was valid to everyone.\n\nThe behavior was, indeed, non-deterministic-- though that wasn\'t known at the time (which may have caused us to over estimate exactly how many systems were rejecting the chain). None the less, one chain was acceptable to all systems, and another was not. The chain that was not universally acceptable was being rejected by on the order of a quarter of the network hashpower, and by a significant portion of the major services that we were able to check. There would have been no clean reconciliation in the other direction-- the network would have remained substantially split for days/weeks leaving users vulnerable to theft-- with confirmations continuing pre-0.8 side, while in the direction that was taken all that was required was the universally acceptable chain to become longer and then all systems were back in full agreement within hours. \n\n"Bug" is a value judgement. The system doesn\'t care about your or my values, it executes according to what its programming says. And regardless of how you dice it up there was a possible outcome which resulted in enormously less exposure to loss for the system\'s participants; if you\'re going to look to a \'higher authority\' than the mechanical actions of the system the one you should look to is what exposes users to more or less irrecoverable loss.\n\nKeep in mind the reorg solution there was possible because of excessive hashpower centralization (basically ~two parties controlled a majority hashpower) but the situation also arose in part due to hashpower centralization (a small number of miners upgraded much faster than the bulk of the network-- resulting in a situation where the majority hashpower and a majority of users were on very different software).   Had hashpower been more uniformly distributed the more broadly acceptable chain would likely have naturally won out even on a pure length basis just by virtue of being more broadly acceptable.\n \n': 5, 'If I may insert myself into your discussion...\n\nIt seems to me that the whole issue should just be avoided by keeping discordant consensus systems (ones that together would initiate a hard fork) *explicitly* separate, at most linked only *explicitly* through something like a 2-way peg.\n\nWhy should there ever be fear of a fork? Why should anyone ever be forced onto a system that has yet to prove itself?\n\nThe only missing piece is figuring out objective criteria and an explicit protocol for pinching off a sidechain to become the "main" chain with as little disruption as possible\xe2\x80\x94but even a hard fork to do so will be much more trivial, because the sidechain\'s functionality and acceptance will have been tested in the wild.': 2}, ('Dear Blockr.io, you have a bug.', 14): {'[deleted]': 1, 'Or more likely, \xc2\xa9blockr.io 2014-2015': 3, "Just to add another check.

I'm sure there's a very good reason why it was delayed, so don't think I'm nagging. I'm just curious.": 3, 'This was very hard to test for.  Consider:  OpenSSL (or anything else) does not implement the complete BER specification.  This isn\'t surprising or dangerous.  So a differential test must be used, at a minimum.\n\nIf you feed DER specification test vectors into an implementation you\'d learn nothing as the problem doesn\'t happen there.\n\nIf you feed completely random inputs you will never discover the discrepancy; because random inputs are not valid signatures and so fail on all platforms regardless.\n\nIf you feed randomly corrupted valid inputs it will take many billions of tries to reproduce, even with a very fortunate random mutator. Simple bitflips will not suffice, the mutator must insert and change exactly the right bytes. With billions to compare that creates significant constraints on the test harness (e.g. can\'t just serialize out a set of test vectors).\n\nEtc.\n\nWith knowledge of the issue I constructed a special test harness that queried both instrumented OpenSSL and instrumented libsecp256k1 (whos DER parser was intentionally much more restrictive than even 64-bit OpenSSL) with a generator that started with valid signatures and verified that both implementations agreed. This went as far as using specially constructed valid signatures which were very short in order to give the fuzzer a greater chance of success (e.g. the smallest valid signature is ~8 bytes, using some algebraic tricks to construct the pubkey from the signature). Using this harness AFL took multiple CPU day to reproduce the result (this was almost a year ago, and AFL may have improved-- but that doesn\'t change that its multiple-billion-to-one-odds on almost any way of hitting this-- though it also might have gotten lucky).  So in some sense it is _possible_ to find it via other mechanisms than review; but it took powerful tools with a fairly "fortunate" test harness.  My goal there was to try to come up with a harness that would find this class of issue without baking in too much foreknowledge in order to gain more confidence that there were not additional avenues of failure which we didn\'t know about. Unfortunately, the required harness was contrived enough that the level of confidence it gave me, personally, was only so-so. \n\n( As an aside; we did find a vulnerability in OpenSSL via a somewhat specially constructed randomized differential test without knowing about it in advance: https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/2rrxq7/on_why_010s_release_notes_say_we_have_reason_to/ )\n\nFurther evidence that more random testing was unlikely to solve it is that two months ago [Jonas Nick](http://jonasnick.github.io/blog/2015/05/09/fuzzing-bitcoin-consensus/), without knowledge of the vulnerability, used AFL fuzz to verify agreement with Bitcoin Script between Bitcoin Core and alternative implementations. His work turned up several consensus breaking flaws in alternative implementations, but even though those implementations were also consensus inconsistent with the signature parsing of Bitcoin Core it did not turn up this issue.\n\nMy general experience with most cryptographic software is that the level of review and testing is not significantly greater than other Free Software and may well be much less-- because people expect it to be rocket-science. Our testing in Bitcoin has turned up quite a few surprising behaviors and bugs in the things we differentially test against. It\'s a difficult problem, but I too am pleased that Bitcoin creates more motivation to create more secure software-- though I\'m less than pleased with the current state of the world.\n\nWith respect to bounties, the amount of work required to review this sort of stuff is utterly enormous. And even if you are talking about a fairly bug bountiful codebase the success rate will be very low. As the amount of work thats gone into it so far drops the success rate drops further. Meanwhile, people with the experience to do this work can happily earn a good six-figure income warming a desk someplace at a regular job. So bounties could be astronomic and still be a bad marginal choice vs other ways of making money.  Small bounties also often have a paradoxical effect of shifting peoples motivation from the intellectual thrill of success or the respect of ones peers to a purely monetary basis, by which the deal doesn\'t look so good-- thereby discouraging participation.  It\'s a hard problem. \n\nOne of the things we\'ve [explored doing for libsecp256k1](https://github.com/bitcoin/secp256k1/issues/180) is having a contest not to find bugs but instead to attempt to _add_ plausible bugs that the existing tests don\'t find; of course if you find an actual bug you win too. This is a fundamentally easier challenge and has substantial opportunity for success even if the software itself is bug free.\n': 35, "alts that use same code but haven't upgraded to bip66 are vulnerable.....does anyone know what's the state of bip66 in doge and lite and most top of coinmarketcap? /u/rnicoll /r/litecoin ": 2, "Hm, maybe I skimmed the page too quickly, but I got the impression it was taking advantage of Haskell's functional nature to literally test every possible code-path.

Even if miners now don't validate fully, no forks will appear because those miners would just be cutting in their income by creating an invalid chain.\n\nThis was especially worrisome for Bitcoin only after the OpenSSL issue in January 2015 made it clear that some miners were accepting non-DER transactions, presumably because of the (c) option above.
