The number of people demanding Bitcoin varies in number and intensity every second. And the anticipation of future demand is even more volatile. So think of the market rate as the best guess for how much coins are worth and not a solid figure. \n\nThe guess will change all the time, by itself it doesn\'t mean anyone is losing or gaining anything, it\'s just an indicator.

Well it disappeared because that value was speculative, and you did not receive it because you did not sell to secure that price.

If people on the exchanges agree on a price that is $10 higher tomorrow, that obviously changes nothing about the total dollar amount in the bitcoin market. \n\nThe only correlation there is, is that if dollars enter or leave the market, it helps to build either a buy or sell pressure which can move the price and therefore the market cap.

Since those other currencies are so much larger, bitcoin's unit price going up hundreds of dollars only creates a tiny imperceptible change to the unit price of other currencies, but the change in value caused by bitcoin is real and calculable, if not measureable. In order for bitcoin to cause a measurable change in the dollar's purchasing power, its gonna to have to go up to something huge like $50,000 per.

': 1, 'To understand where the money went, you have to understand how prices are formed to begin with.\n\nThink about a neighborhood with 100 houses, and all the houses are fairly similar.  At any given moment, 3 or 4 of the houses are for sale.  The other 97 homes aren\'t for sale because families are busy living in them.  In this scenario, we use the selling-price of the 3 homes to determine the "value" of the other 97 homes.  So if one home sells for $300,000 then it\'s safe to say another home that\'s similar will sell for a similar value.  Then you just add up all the homes in the neighborhood and you can say (in an abstract way) "This neighborhood is worth $30,000,000."\n\nThat\'s exactly how a "market cap" works.  It\'s just a made-up price based on the sale of a few marginal examples.  Now imagine Bill Gates comes to that neighborhood and announces he has a strong desire to buy every house that\'s currently for-sale there.  What do you think would suddenly happen to the price of those three houses?  Naturally they would rise.  And the rise would be pretty dramatic.  Each family living in those houses would immediately know they could get away with jacking up the asking-price of their home because they finally have an interested buyer (and he\'s rich).   The higher sale-price of those three houses would make the value of those other 97 homes skyrocket because the market assumption is that if those other people put their homes on the market, Bill will swoop in and buy them (thus keeping the market elevated).\n\nSo this same marginal price-formation is what\'s going on with Bitcoin (and any traded commodity or stock or currency).  The Bitcoins that are being traded form the price for the rest of the Bitcoins that **aren\'t** being traded.  And the funny thing is, there are many more of the latter - it\'s like an iceberg.  Only a few coins are exposed to the market (less than 1% are for sale at any given moment).  But what if that suddenly turned to 3%?  In that case, the market would be flooded with "for-sale" Bitcoins, and the demand wouldn\'t be able to keep up.  That would knock the price down for every Bitcoin in existence (even the not-for-sale Bitcoins).\n\nSo now you see that $7 billion never actually existed.  It was just a shorthand way of saying what Bitcoin is "worth" overall.\n\nHere\'s a relevant video you might enjoy:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_XiA4U_XsE\n\nSo now you see why it\'s ridiculous when people say a rich person (or government) could by "every single Bitcoin" for $7 billion.  That\'s simply not true.  By the time they buy the "for-sale" Bitcoins, it would completely deplete the market of available Bitcoins and drive the price of all of them sky-high (into $100,000\'s of thousands of dollars each).  It isn\'t possible to "buy every Bitcoin", just like it\'s not possible to "buy every pair of pants" - the price will rise as you\'re buying them.

The credit company would then extend the same to you for a profit in interest.  Due to the deflationary nature of bitcoin, this will most like be unfeasible, because you might never be able to pay back the amount you borrowed, let alone interest and bitcoins are much harder to "collect" than fiat.

Pretending otherwise just shows that you don\'t know what you\'re talking about. Other points of disagreement:\n\n - "Wage stickiness" is a thing, there\'s no reason for you to imply otherwise\n - Deflation is bad. It discourages investment, lowers spending, and encourages declining economic activity. Inflation is also bad, but small amounts of inflation are preferable to small amounts of deflation because it encourages activity by forcing money to remain actively in the economy, lest it lose value.\n - What a pity it is that wives have to work. God knows that, given a choice, they wouldn\'t. Or would they? Hmm. Maybe women want to aspire and have productive ambitions too?\n - Thank you for the obligatory "fiat monetary system will fail" ramble. I\'m pretty sure no thread in /r/bitcoin about macroeconomics can exist without one. Just like the others, you fail to actually explain why it would happen.  You also don\'t seem to notice (or mind) that government expenditure as a % of GDP in the US hasn\'t risen that much in the last 60-70 years, especially when excluding 2007-present. You further don\'t mind that government expenditure as % of GDP is 10-15% higher in most other developed countries than it is in the US.

The non productive portions of the economy (government, financial) have grown massively on the value that has been taken from the population via inflation to the point where the productive economy is now gutted.\n\nConsider the analogy of the productive portion of the population being on a generating treadmill.  We trudge and generate gains for ourselves.  Natural phenomenon, increases in population and gains in technology and productivity, make our work easier over time.  The government/financial sector tells us these natural increases in gains are deflationary and deflation is "bad" due to "wage stickiness" and such.  They take over the gain controls of the treadmill (money) and the gauge that tells us how much gains we\'ve created and how hard we\'ve worked (economic measures like inflation).  \n\nNow the increases in population, technology, and productivity still happen of course as they are natural.  But rather than have the people get the benefits of those increases, (deflation is "bad" you know), the government/financial system takes these gains while telling us its for our own good.  They take these extra generated gains and build a huge military industrial complex and a financial street like never seen before. And then because they can, they take a little more than the extra generated.  \n\nThis goes on until wives have to be trudging on the treadmill too, and despite that added effort the actual gains received per worker is lower than it used to be because the government/final sector are taking even more than what was gained by increases in technology/productivity and added people trudging.  But most people don\'t notice because they control the gauges that supposedly show us our efforts and gains and those gauges tell us we\'re doing better even though we\'re doing worse.\n\nWhen someone take a close look at what\'s going on and starts to complain, "educated" people like you have been trained to tell them to look at the more tangible increases in technology and how lucky they are to have iphones and cheap air flights.  There is no mention of course how those would\'ve come anyway in addition to more gains from increased labor if those gains weren\'t being stolen to make the non-productive government and financial sector the largest portions of the economy.\n\nThis goes on until the fiat monetary system used to manipulate the population collapses under the corruption, misallocations, and over-growth of non-productive areas of the economy that it spawns.

Yet in consequence these laws shut down services and businesses that aim to make money more usable and flexible within the modern age. \n\n**Let\'s look at some recent history of this example**\n\nLet\'s look at the Liberty Reserve. Incorporated in 2006, the Liberty Reserve let anyone in the world sign up with an email address and then send USD, EUR, or Gold to any other account with marginal fees. This made the service very popular amongst travelers, FOREX traders, and simply people trying to send money from one place on the globe to another. \n\nYet their system was unique in that there were no chargebacks and that signing up was available to anyone with an email address -- no bank account needed. Naturally, this sort of system was so useful that some criminals decide to launder money through these networks. \n\n[In 2013, the US government shut down the company, seized all the assets, and arrested the CEO & several employees on account of letting $6b go laundered through their network.](http://www.coindesk.com/ios-users-get-first-decentralized-bitcoin-wallet-breadwallet/) \n\n> ***But ForestOfGrins, I don\'t see how this relates to your point, the government was stopping money laundering correct?***\n\nCorrect, no longer can criminals use the Liberty Reserve to transfer funds.\n\nYet did this stop illicit operations being performed by criminals? *Not even close.*\n\n\n**Not even one month later**\n\n> [HSBC was accused of failing to monitor more than $670 billion in wire transfers and more than $9.4 billion in purchases of U.S. currency from HSBC Mexico, allowing for money laundering, prosecutors said. The bank also violated U.S. economic sanctions against Iran, Libya, Sudan, Burma and Cuba, according to a criminal information filed in the case.](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-07-02/hsbc-judge-approves-1-9b-drug-money-laundering-accord.html)\n\nWhat was the penalty for this massive laundering scheme that benefitted south american drug, sex, and gun smuggling? \n\n> The bank, Europe\xe2\x80\x99s largest, agreed to pay a $1.25 billion forfeiture and $665 million in civil penalties under the settlement, prosecutors announced in December. At a hearing the same month, Gleeson told prosecutors there had been \xe2\x80\x9cpublicized criticism\xe2\x80\x9d of the agreement, ***which lets the bank and management avoid further criminal proceedings over the charges.***\n\nSo basically they pay a marginal fee of the profits and then nothing else because "it\'s already bad PR". \n\n*If the government was actually concerned about money laundering I would expect the consequences of a larger operation to be more dramatic. Yet somehow a fine and bad PR don\'t quite measure up to shutting down the business, seizing assets, and being arrested.* \n\n*[As a fun side note, another year later and HSBC is in the news again for more wrong-doing.

Just because a person hasn\'t been proven guilty yet, does not say anything about the legal or constitutional right to prevent monitoring. i.e. it\'s completely okay for the police to set up a speed sensor on a highway and monitor if someone is breaking the speed limit, right?

Miller, 425 U.S. 435 (1976) that individuals do not have a "reasonable expectation of privacy" under the Fourth Amendment in financial records pertaining to them but maintained by a bank in the normal course of business.\n\nAs a consequence the right to financial privacy act was created:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_Financial_Privacy_Act\n\nBut that was amended later, including by the patriot act. It\'s a pretty complex legal issue with lots of back n forth. As it stands though, there simply isn\'t a big debate about the constitutional backing of monitoring people or even citizens. There is huge political consensus between republicans and democrats of the value of things like the patriot act, KYC/AML, the patriot act and generally any anti-terrorist act, many of the things the democrats chided republicans for during the Bush years have essentially been copied and extended to the extent that Cheney was praising him for it, and KYC/AML is probably the least controversial part of that package. Most people simply don\'t care because they don\'t think they\'ll ever be affected. (e.g. I\'ll never launder money in my life, what do I care?). But philosophically and politically this is a very dangerous way of thinking even though it makes a lot of sense intuitively. \n\nIt\'s one of the most disappointing things of the past decade in my opinion, because Obama ran for a big part on his ability to showcase constitutional infringements by his predecessor. After all, he taught constitutional law at an ivy league plus university, after having been educated to do so at an ivy league university. If you look at past interviews he has a very strong constitutional understanding, but has sadly completely waved it away.
