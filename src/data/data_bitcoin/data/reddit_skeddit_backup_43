Im assuming this to mean that with "up to 4x" savings with P2SH SW transactions combined with non-P2SH SW style transactions that it roughly equates to 1.7x. Is this accurate?\n\nAnd, under what conditions do we see a 4x compression? What conditions for 3x compression? Is this all about the number of signatures?

I know people are going to use LN, though whether people "want to use multisig" is a relevant discussion. I think that its a better application of the technology because its safer in a lot of commerce applications, but it also introduces extra complexity and in some instances can create risk, such as a party not wishing to sign off on the transaction and causing the funds to stall forever, or other party looses key, etc. I understand these risks *can* be potentially mitigated through time lock, but technical capability and practical usages are two different things.\n\nLike all things, there\'s a balance in the usage with benefits and negatives.

A 4x level of compression will never happen because the signatures alone count for 0.25 x size of sigs.

Yesterday I ordered a t-shirt from Marketplace seller "allthingsbitcoin" to try this service out.  \n\nI had a few problems.\n\n1.  Not sure if the fault was with Purse or my wallet software (Mycelium iOS) but I had trouble paying.  When I scanned the QR code and sent the payment it arrived, but Purse showed an error that my payment was not complete due to being short 0.00001167 BTC (less than a penny).    \n\n2.  I thought about just ignoring the above short payment since it is less than a penny.  However, I could not communicate my t-shirt size to the seller because the buyer-seller dialog box only shows up AFTER you pay!\n\n3.  So I sent another payment for 0.00001167 and of course the mining fee is larger than this size payment.\n\n4.  Then the dialog box showed up so I could communicate my size to the seller.  Note that an hour has now passed since I started my checkout due to waiting on two payments before being able to communicate the size I needed.  Should be able to do this during checkout and not have to come back later to do this.\n\n5.  Unlike Amazon or most sellers, Purse sends no email with sale or shipping confirmations.  Maybe privacy lovers prefer this, but I like email confirmations.  With Purse, one must log into their Purse account to see status updates from the seller.  It would be nice if there were a feature to turn email notifications on/off.  This way privacy nuts can get less email, but normal buyers can receive email notifications from the seller.\n\n6.  Also, I could not find any means of contacting the seller BEFORE buying to get questions answered, which I think is odd/lacking.\n\nOverall, I am happy to see this Marketplace service available as another option to bitcoiners.  However, my first experience was only marginal.  I hope improvements are made to this service, especially in the communications area. \n\n/u/memorydealers \n': 2}, ('Hi brothers I have a question', 0): {'Ok! It have an Android app???

And this fact should outweigh the cost of the license since the plugin is not just some fancy widget but their means to accept payments from customers.  \n\n> I would be curious what your adoption has been like with merchants. \n\nThere haven't been a lot of sales yet. The merchants that bought it are really happy, though. :) I am not absolutely sure what the exact reason is but here are my guesses:\n\n1. People don't know that the plugin exists.  \nI am a one-man show with a limited budget, so it's hard to advertise while also providing support, improving the code, answering pre-sales questions, and working in my day job.   \n\n2. People don't understand or don't care about the benefits.  \nThis is also a communication issue. Even though this place is full of people that have a lot of experience when it comes to these questions, OP's post and some of the comments in this thread are an example that most people are unaware of the consequences of using a payment processor. They also don't read the terms or privacy statements, because if they did they would get an idea what is actually happening in the background.  \n\n3. Benefits don't outweigh the costs for merchants.   \nIt depends on many factors if it makes sense for a business to handle the payments directly. So I understand that if you are either not aware of the full benefits or underestimate your current situation, the additional effort of accepting the payments directly doesn't seem to be worth it at this point.  \n\n4. It's still too complicated.    \nThe whole tech still has a long way to go before the overall UX is more intuitive for non-technical people. With great power comes great responsibility. And not everyone wants to take responsibility when he doesn't have to.  \n\n5. You have to pay money to get it.  \nAs I said, I have to earn money to make a living and I did not sell out to investors. If someone wants me to update the code and answer support tickets he has to pay that license fee. If even that is too much, I'm sorry, you have to go elsewhere.  \n\n\n> Do you think there are enough merchants out there that want to do it themselves to make it worthwhile for someone like myself to setup shop, perhaps starting out by recommending and setting up CryptoWoo for businesses?  \n\nI think it makes absolute sense to establish a consultant business around digital currencies and commerce. But you have to flexible enough to adapt to changes in the industry and keep a close eye on your capital burn rate. So if this is the only thing your business has to offer I don't think it would keep you afloat in the short- to medium-term, but it can probably be worthwhile even right now if it's just part of a service portfolio.\n\nOverall, I feel that digital currencies as a way to transfer value between individuals will work out in some form; and that evolution will only take place if we push things forward and try to make the most of the tools that are currently available.  \n\nLet me know when you start your consulting business! I'm happy to give you a discount on the licenses if you're setting up clients with my plugin. \n\n ": 1, "> Not only recognized the app that I was paying a Coinbase (?) invoice\n\nThanks to BIP70 payment protocol.

For an "ordinary" merchant that do have traditional book-keeping processes in place, pays taxes according to the law, etc, and having no special interest in Bitcoin, receiving and holding bitcoins is not really an option.

What's available to buy is not their own inventory; those are separate entities looking to sell.\nTo put it simply, imagine traditional marketplaces in several villages. Stretch your imagination and assume that the main product that's being bought and sold are uniform blue marbles. \nThe exchanges are essentially the guys that permit you to set up stalls, and they collect fees in their own village marketplace after every marble that's bought and sold. Their job is to make sure the local marketplace operates smoothly, without disturbances, but they don't care that much about price and they don't trade regularly trade themselves. A well run marketplace will draw in more people, which leads to more trades, and more revenue.\nMost of the stalls in the marketplaces are ran by speculators who try to make a profit by selling when they think the price will go down and buying when they think it's going to go up. (Buy low, sell high)\n\nNow, imagine crowds of people suddenly appearing at a single marketplace (marketplace A), buying those blue marbles furiously. The stall owners, seeing this, will start marking up the price of the marbles and they (together with the local villagers) will also try to buy a lot of them before the mob can, with the goal of selling it to the crowd at a higher price. [A rally ensues, price skyrockets]\n\nNews spreads fast, other village marketplaces, like marketplace B, experience a similar rally. They speculate the the mob will appear at their place as well, but what's more, they can now buy at marketplace B and sell at marketplace A while making a profit. [Arbitrage]\n\nLet's say the frenzied mob swarms all marketplaces where the marble is available and price really starts skyrocketing. Other people who don't keep track of the price take notice and they might want to jump on board and visit the markets to buy.  \nMore importantly, seeing this, a lot of people who hold marbles at their homes might decide that maybe it's a good idea to sell at least some of them. Sure, they look nice, but if they sell now they can turn a massive profit since they bought them cheaper. New supply keeps appearing as people visit the market to sell. Stall owners, who just earlier bought marbles to sell higher will also want to see profit and start selling some. Some of the mob will also see that their investment has multiplied in value and will try to realize those gains by selling.\n\nIf the mob suddenly realize that price has stopped increasing and it is in fact trickling down then the market can turn around and the same stampede can occur in the opposite direction.\n\nI got carried away with the village example, but the main takeaway is that exchanges will never run out of bitcoins. There are a lot of independent market participants and someone will always have some to sell, and someone else will always be looking to buy some, the main question is just the price.\nIf you wanted to spend 10 billion dollars on bitcoin, you would be able to get 10 billion dollar's worth, but that's only because the price would be much, much higher than now.\n\n\nI just want to add that right now exchange volumes are a bit muted due to this sideways drift we've been having for a while now. Volatility is **spectacularly low**.  \nA lot of traders are expecting a big move soon (next week or the one after) in either direction. My guess is right now you would be able to buy a couple of thousand coins in one day, on multiple exchanges, without influencing price too much. More than that and you could trigger and the village market stampede scenario could play out with unpredictable consequences. \n\n": 1, "A lot of them probably were.

Lightning is a trading token network that attempts to solve one of the main problems with existing trading token networks: that you have to trust them. \n\n1. **No Trust Needed**: Unlike a normal token trading system like Coinbase or Changetip, the trading network requires no trust in any other person or company.\n2. **Instant Trading**: as soon as you transmit a token at Internet speed, the funds are sent. There is no need to wait potentially hours for a finalized version of a transaction, unlike the Blockchain.\n3. **No minimum trades**: you can trade as small an amount as you would like, unlike the Blockchain, which has minimum limits.\n4. **Improved privacy**: The network doesn\'t broadcast your transaction to the world or store it forever, it just sends it to one person. \n5. **Rewards nodes**: The network requires relaying nodes to operate, and in return users will pay fees for these relays.\n\nThe network won\'t "fix scalability for good".

A gold receipt can. Gold is highly fungible and there is no way for its owner to know that the custodian actually keeps 100% reserves.  This is where the innovation of fractional reserve comes from. Gold custodians realized they could cheat as long as they kept good books and that enough people trusted them that not everyone demanded their gold at once. The Medici family gained their famous prominence this way. Not surprisingly accounting innovation, double entry ledgers, was necessary to make this happen.  \n\nSecond, Lightning is not a credit system. These are not IOUs.\n\nThird, a credit system based upon Bitcoin, would be an enourmous improvement over a credit system based on bank currency. Sure there is trust involved. But it's much reduced trust. The assets can be known, and locked in with multisig smart contracts. Legions of regulators can be replaced with a single high reputation notary. Fractional reserve ratios would be agreed to by creditors and debtors with small pools of smart contracts and visible on a blockchain. Reserve funds would not be movable with a pen flick. VISA type scaling is probably far easier to achieve than the way VISA does it. Keeping VISA's ledger sane is a huge task, that probably only a tiny fraction is necessary to do with Bitcoin. The asset side of the balance sheet self manages on the blockchain, transaction data could be maintained on an R3 style data blockchain, settlement rails can be done trustlessly using Bitcoin or even Lightning for that matter.

So many crypto systems have emerged after years of use. Sometimes it's a flaw discovered in the algorithm itself, sometimes it's due to implementation, etc. SHA2 probably won't be broken due to keylength, but that doesn't mean it will always be considered secure. Look at MD5 to see how broken something thought to be secure can be. \n\nPlus, and while Bitxoin has great minds behind it, it's important to note that either Core or any alternative implantation could get broken due to other oversights by programmers. Brute force attacks, searching the entire key space, are basically last resort methods. \n\nWill SHA2 get broken? Not saying that. But don't say it can't happen": 2, 'That\'s fair.  But while a weakness might be found in one particular crypto algorithm, even a severe one that renders the algorithm useless, that\'s still a far cry from "if encryption breaks" which implies that ALL encryption breaks.  And THAT is very unlikely...\n': 1, "I think you've got some great answers by people already so won't got through each but just to summarise...\n\n\nThe miners take a bunch of random data, call it {X} and run it through the hash function to get the number H.  If H is less than a value as set by the bitcoin protocol rules, that miner is said to have solved the block so can share it with everyone who can quickly validate it that the hash of {X} is indeed less than the target number everyone is looking for.\n\n\nSo {X} actually consists of transactions people push on the network, every time a new transaction is received {X} changes so the hash changes.  Now typically miners are wanting to show they are doing work so inside {X} is a value called a nonce which they can change to be whatever number they like.  Each time they change this nonce, it clearly changes the set {X} slightly so gives a radically different hash H value.  Miners simply keep changing this nonce and a time field and perhaps an extranonce and keep getting new H's.  Eventually someone finds the solution and can share it to the world.\n\n\nThe trick is that each miner also can include one single special transaction in {X} which is called a coinbase transaction.  The rules allow a miner to credit any bitcoin address with a coinbase transaction up to the current reward level (currently 25BTC).  This means {X} contains new coins the miner sends to their address and if they find a valid H they can share the block with everyone thereby creating new coins for the economy that the miner owns to begin with (Coinbase transactions can only be spent after 100 blocks after it have been made I believe).\n\n": 1, '> Transactions are verified by miners. The next block is created by using the cryptographic hash of every previous block in that chain.\n\nTransactions are included by miners but not necessarily verified, for example a miner could include an invalid transaction in a block\n\n> Which miner gets the 25 bitcoin\'s released with the new blocks?\n\nOnly one miner gets one block. So get all the fees and all the 25 block reward (12.5 soon)\n\n> How do confirmations work, and are these confirmations linked with the bitcoin reward for a new block? How so?\n\nConfirmations is another word for a block. Because the blocks build on each other as you mentioned, the more blocks that come along the more "confirmed" it is considered because to remove the transaction from history would require a greater number of blocks, which would be costly to create\n\n> I once read that if encryption breaks, bitcoin is the last thing we\'ll worry about, what are some good examples of other things that society massively relies on in terms of encryption?\n\nBitcoin doesn\'t use encryption, it uses cryptography which isn\'t quite the same thing. If the cryptography algorithms break, they would break all sorts of things like pretty much any website or App that allows you to sign in to your account for example. Of course we\'d probably work out some other algorithm and be fine in the end. Much of what secures Bitcoin isn\'t cryptography at all, but just standard math: if math breaks then yeah maybe it\'s brown trousers time \n': 1, '1. Transactions are verified by nodes, it is a picky difference but an important one.  Other than that, cool.\n\n\n2. It is a special transaction called the coinbase transaction (nothing to do with the online exchange).  Probably the most accreate dictiption fo the transaction type is here https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Transaction .\n\n\n3. When a transaction is included in a block it has 1 confirmation.  When a block is built on top of that block it has 2 confirmations etc..  So you could also call confirmations "blocks built on top of the one that had the transaction in it plus one"... but that is a bit of a mouthful.\n\n\n4. Banking, Internet, Military, Cellphones, TV, Nuclear Weapons, Space Probes, Cars....   If encryption goes away we may as well have a Zombie Apocalypse.\n\n\n5. No idea sorry ;) .': 1, '1. Sort of, but your wording is clumsy.  Try something like this (feel free to use this):  A block is a group of numerous transactions, packaged together and verified with a \'proof of work\' that proves the miner invested significant computational resources in creating that block.  Each block includes the cryptographic hash of the block that preceded it, thus any block can trace its \'chain\' back to the original Genesis Block.\n\n2. The miner that gets the 25BTC is the miner that mines the block.  More on this in a sec.\n\n3. A confirmation just means that your transaction was included in a mined block.  Multiple confirmations means that block has other blocks mined on top of it.  \n\n4. "If encryption breaks" is one of those crazy ideas like "If the sun explodes".  It\'s not going to happen anytime soon.  However basically any computer system that has security relies on crypto.  Crypto isn\'t just encryption (like scrambling of data), it\'s also used for authentication.  So for example, when buying stuff online, without reliable crypto not only could you not be sure someone isn\'t tapping your connection and stealing your credit card, but you also couldn\'t be sure you were even talking to the e-store you thought you were talking to (and not some attacker\'s server).  \n\n5. No idea, sorry.  Ask Google.  \n\nOkay some bitcoin transaction stuff\n\nA bitcoin address consists of two pieces: a private key, and an address.  The two go together.  Anyone who knows the address can send Bitcoins to that address, but only the person with the matching private key can use that key to sign a transaction spending those Bitcoins.  \n\nSo when I want to send you money, my Bitcoin wallet uses one of its private keys (it will likely have many) to sign a transaction giving X number of Bitcoins to your address.  My wallet then sends this transaction out on the Bitcoin Peer-to-peer (P2P) network where it is relayed to all other *nodes*.  A node is a computer running the Bitcoin software, it relays transactions and keeps a copy of the Blockchain (every block since the beginning).  The nodes each verify that the transaction is legit, then pass it on to other nodes.  Within a second or two, all Bitcoin nodes know about my transaction and keep it in a temporary buffer called the *mempool*.  \n\nSome of those nodes belong to miners.  The function of miners is to take transactions out of mempool and package them together in *blocks*, which become part of the blockchain.  A miner will assemble a block out of mempool transactions, as well as a *coinbase transaction* (not to be confused with the coinbase.com service).  The coinbase transaction gives the current block reward (25BTC) to that miner.  \nHowever for the block to be valid, the miner has to complete a *proof of work* (PoW).  The PoW is a sort of random computational problem (sort of like a lottery) that only gets \'solved\' once every 10 minutes (the difficulty adjusts automatically to ensure that it\'s solved about once per 10mins).  When a miner solves the PoW, that means they have a valid PoW to attach to their block, which means the block is now a good and valid block.  They then send this block to nodes, who validate it and then send it to other nodes.  That block contains many transactions that were in mempool, once they\'re included in a block they are \'confirmed\'.  As more miners mine blocks on top of that block, the number of \'confirmations\' goes up.  That\'s because since finding a PoW (and thus making a block) is hard, the deeper in the chain you go the more secure you are.  \n\nIt\'s important to understand that on the Blockchain, everything can be verified.  The Bitcoin I send you can be traced to the last address it was owned by, and the address before that, and the address before that, and so on and so forth all the way back to the coinbase transaction which created it and awarded it to a miner.  \n\nNow you probably hear a lot of stuff about miners earning small amounts, not 25BTC.  That\'s because of *pooled mining*.  Since only 1 block is found every 10 mins, and there are many thousands of miners, chances are a small mining operation without much computation power won\'t find a block very often.  So it\'s better to pool lots of small miners together and have them work cooperatively, then when a block is found, split the reward among them according to how much computation power each miner contributed.  \n\nHope that helps!': 1, "1) Blocks are the container that transactions are sealed into. Transactions are verified by nodes. The hash of the next block does include a hash of every previous block before it hashed together.\n\n2) The miner that randomly creates the hash that fits the parameters required of the next block is rewarded the 25Bitcoin (soon to be 12.5Bitcoin). The parameters for the next block are automatically made more difficult as miners upgrade their hardware to produce more hashes per second. This is done by averaging the timestamps between blocks and increasing the number of leading zero's required for finding blocks every 2016 blocks (approximately 2 weeks) such that with the number of random hashes received by the network per second will chance upon a block every 10 minutes on average.\n\n3) Confirmations: When a transaction is submitted to the network it usually propagates more or less instantaneously. However it is not considered a confirmed transaction until it is confirmed in a block. Each subsequent block that includes that transaction history increases the confirmation count by 1. Most people consider a transaction pretty much immutable after 6 blocks. The reason confirmations are important is for several reasons. First it is possible to attempt a double spend transaction by sending the same coins to multiple addresses at the same time. Until the coins are confirmed in a block all of these transactions will propagate through the network. Once a miner includes transactions in a block, it can only choose one transaction, usually the one with the highest fee/byte ratio. For this reason a single confirmation is usual critical when transacting with unknown or untrusted parties. Additionally, the block chain can temporarily split or fork creating a parrellel universe where in one fork a transaction A to B is included in a block and on the other fork transaction A to C is included in a block. These forks are quite rare and usually resolve themselves within 6 blocks or less. For this reason the number of confirmations should depend on the size of the transaction and relative trust between transacting parties.\n\n4) I'm sure others have a better idea than myself on this one, but if encryption breaks down fundamentally, a lot of the systems we use to secure personal information will be open to the world. Criminals, governments, your neighbors, could easily steal your identity, use personal information to harass and coerce you. The possibility of any kind of electronic transaction will come into question. Ecommerce would crumble. National secrets coming public causing global instability. \n\n5) Several orders of magnitude more than Bitcoin": 1}, ('Official RNG tampered with.
