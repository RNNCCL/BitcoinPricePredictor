Then you trust that server to hold your escrow wallet and details about your upstream. Then when your peer arrives, on the same server that they trust their funds with, you both connect to a NAT tunneling service to establish a reverse proxy connection for data transfer.

You have viewers paying the server wallet in both sites. You have the server wallet pay your wallet after the streaming is done, on both sites. A fee is kept by the server on both sites. They are virtually identical except for these differences: Xotika has a high quality video re-transmission server that can\'t be done by regular streamers, there is a directory, you can check the merchandise before you pay, the pay is unrestricted and voluntary, the participants are protected against each-other off the platform and are pseudo-anonymous.\n\nStreamium is not decentralized. Bitcoin is decentralized. Tor is decentralized. IRC is decentralized. Zeronet is decentralized. The Internet is decentralized. Streamium is not.

Specifically, any 256-bit number from 0x1 to 0xFFFF FFFF FFFF FFFF FFFF FFFF FFFF FFFE BAAE DCE6 AF48 A03B BFD2 5E8C D036 4140 is a valid private key.\n\nSo the private key space is just under 2^256\n\n> Question: Are all private keys given away? Or are there limits?\n\nAll private keys reside within the private key space (any natural number between 1 and the number above). The limit is the space, and every private key is 'known' or 'given away' in the sense that they are known to exist within that space. The space is far (far far far) too large to search, though.\n\n> Would there also be a problem with storage then?\n\nSomewhat.\n\nA typical microSD drive can contain 64GB worth of data. One of such drives can contain 2 x 10^9 (2 billion) private keys (at 256 bits each).\n\nSo to store all possible private keys (not public keys or addresses) would require roughly 5.7 x 10^67 of those SD drives.\n\nFor reference, there's about 10^18 grains of sand here on earth, and there's on the order of 10^80 atoms in the universe. So you need *[somewhere in between]* the amount of SD drives.\n\nA single SD drive is about 1mm in height. So if you were to stack all of these on top of eachother, **your stack of SD cards will be roughly 6.5 x 10^37 times larger than *the diameter of the universe*.**\n\nAnd that's only storing the private keys. And disregarding the computation required to get those numbers *on* the SD cards, let alone the computation required to search for collisions in the blockchain.\n\n// Edit:\n\nPerhaps a more apt analogy: A single SD card weighs about 2 grams. If you were to stack these SD cards in a cuboid, its total mass would be 5.7 x 10^34 times *larger than our sun* (assuming you can get the raw materials to build the things, of course). The sun would collapse into a black hole if it were mere 8 times more massive - this stack of SD cards is slightly more massive than that (by 30 odd more magnitudes) - so it would immediately collapse into a black hole. It would also be the most massive black hole our milky way or probably the universe has ever seen, by another 20 or so magnitudes. So I guess it's pretty safe to say we won't be storing the entirety of private keys any time soon.\n\nSo yeah.": 2, "You could create an nLocktime encumbered transaction, spending some amount to a new address you own, and then destroy the private key you used to create that transaction.\n\nThen hand your nephew the transaction and private key of the address the transaction is spending to, and pray to jesus that he doesn't lose it.": 2, "In regards to escrow, I've heard of the whole smart oracle way to hold assets and distribute them when its time, however is there any other ways to achieve escrow with Bitcoin?": 1, 'A private Key is a number with 77 digits, the first one is fixed.

Pathetic.**': -3, "A common question, and probably an unclear answer :(\n\nThe way core developers reach consensus is vague. For one, because the term 'core developer' is not well defined: are these the people who have commit access? Are these the people who contribute code? Are these the people that review proposals, or critique contributions? All or none of the above? And who gets to decide who's a core developer anyway? Vague.\n\nSecondly, assuming the group of 'core developers' is known, how do you measure consensus among them? Voting? ACK/NACK? Vetoes, politics, crying out on Twitter? Where does discussion happen, how is this discussion kept on-topic, on-target, how is the result of a discussion objectively measured? This, too, is not well defined.\n\nThird, assuming some means of measuring consensus is known, how is the case where a proposal which has not reached consensus, but must critically be solved in some perceived timeframe, handled? (the block size limit, for example) Is consensus bypassed? Is progress stagnated? What?\n\nSo, none of these have very well defined answers. But note that I'm not saying this is necessarily a problem.\n\n-----\n\nThere's a de-facto process one can observe. And I'll try to keep it short (mainly because I'll get it wrong in the details ;) )\n\nFirst, you need to divide consensus critical changes with all the rest.\n\nConsensus critical changes are the ones that touch any consensus-related code. These changes are handled with much more scrutiny than all the rest, meaning more testing, more eyes that review it, and more discussion related to it. If there is contention on this issue either on GitHub, or the mailing list, or IRC, or wherever else well-founded scientific discussion on an implementation may take place, then the issue is generally not merged into the code base until the contention is resolved.\n\nWladimir van der Laan is the lead developer currently, so he'll generally merge these issues after discussion is over (or more precisely, objecting positions have somewhat objectively from a perspective of computer science been mitigated or resolved - and the general sentiment in the places of discussion is such that the issue is ready to be merged (which could be very subjective)). He's made it a point that he does not merge any consensus critical code for which he does not believe this is the case. Note, though, that he is not the 'key' you are looking for - I don't believe such a key exists. \n\nChanges like these always (as far as I'm aware) come with a BIP:\n\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0001.mediawiki\n\n'All the rest' are changes to everything else, these are changes like code architecture, general improvements to the way bitcoin core does things, like better address / peer discovery / management, headers-first and pruning, code formatting, json-rpc stuff, docs, etc. etc. - This is code that enjoys less scrutiny and experiences generally less contention. Consensus is not explicitly needed because the changes are either uncontroversial, generally considered 'good' - no matter how you look at it, and safe for the network. The lead developer can drop the hammer on these and acts like the 'benevolent dictator' if there is no clear consensus here. Which is safe, because none of these changes are consensus critical.\n\n----\n\nPersonally, I think the way Bitcoin Core makes changes is fine. I don't particularly like the idea of a 'benevolent dictator' making changes to consensus critical code if there is contention on the issue; I like to believe the reason for contention is a scientific disagreement rather than a political one, and I like to think a scientific disagreement may always be resolved given proper discussion - which is also a big reason to try and (possibly fruitlessly) avoid making political changes (or rather, decisions - ie. changes not coming from a technical perspective) on the bitcoin protocol.": 2, '> BlockstreamCoin would be a more fitting name currently.\n\nSigh.': 4, 'Thanks for starting it!

This was supposed to happen by building an LTB talent market and reputation system where people could offer their services and be rated based on their work.\n\nAnother crucial thing that got put on the back burner for Tokenly's sake was a drive to get more advertising on the site, including building a planned system where people could easily buy ads with their LTBC or BTC, vending machine style.\n\nWhen those things didn't happen, editors (who were already under-compensated compared to writers) started to get fed up and leave, which increased backlog issues and frustrated the writers.

The answer would be the same.\n\n>why has no one attacked the network with 1MB blocks?\n\nPerhaps no one felt like attacking, perhaps no one had an incentive to damage Bitcoin at the time, perhaps no one with the technical capability to attack Bitcoin felt bored and antisocial enough.\n\nThis isn\'t a very interesting question since security101 will teach you that something not being attacked isn\'t proof it is secure.': 4, "Someone a while back suggested growing the block size by calculating the average block size of the last n blocks (say 2016 blocks) and then setting the new maximum block size to be a proportion (say 50%) bigger than this.

This seems like an excellent way of aligning the growth of bitcoin adoption with the maximum size in each block. \n\nOn average blocks would be gravitate to being two-thirds full allowing a nice fee structure to emerge for miners.  Also it's resistant to attack because it would be expensive to try and spam a rise in the block-size and then maintain that rise.

It's matches the very successful proven method of raising and lowering the difficulty every 2 weeks and follows the KISS principles (Keep it Simple, Stupid).

That\'s undeniable.\n\nBu a pool or cartel of pools cannot double spend without taking that hashing capacity offline to mine a private fork of the blockchain. Since most pools do not own their own equipment they risk having those mining there defect once the miners realize the pool\'s "luck" has changed (from no longer finding any blocks on the public Bitcoin blockchain). If enough defect, that cartel no longer has 51% and the attack fails. Thus the "OMG, ghash.io has 51%" was simple ignorance of what they could do with their users\'s hashing capacity.\n\nAdditionally a double spend is of no consequence until the recipient has delivered non-reversible value to the attacker. Most exchanges don\'t allow large withdrawal requests to be processed immediately due to the use of cold storage -- making it necessary for the attacker to wait much longer than six confirmations to do any significant damage.\n\nSo there\'s really little economic incentive to performing a 51% attack.\n\nAbout the biggest risk is if a manufacturer were to develop chips that have such an enormous performance advantage over existing tech (like an order of magnitude more) such that they could bring down the cost of the attack such that the attack could be performed profitably. The protection against that is that the manufacturers are competitive.\n\nMaybe there had been a chance of this happening when we went from FPGA&GPUs to ASICs, but nowadays the manufacturers are having to battle physics (e.g., 16nm chips) to see any significant performance gains but those gains just don\'t give the manufacturer the needed boost such that attacking is more profitable than either selling the chips to others or mining themselves.\n\ntl;dr: The 51% attack is not Bitcoin\'s weak spot.': 1}, ('ELI5: exchange pricing inefficiencies', 0): {"Localbitcoin has the highest difference but this is individuals who have to run the gauntlet of fraud risk in exchange for convenience hence charge a premium.\nThe other exchanges there is not much in it, I see $240 vs $242...

There\'s been some really really good work done on efficiency, a lot of which Greg (nullc) was involved in and he deserves much credit for it.  \n\nGreg calls the blocksize limit \'resource management functionality\', but the limit was never designed to manage resources, it was designed to prevent intentional spam from making the blockchain grow unmanageably large back when 100kB blocks were \'big\'.  Satoshi had originally not wanted any limit but was persuaded to add one as an anti-spam measure, not to conserve resources.\n\nGreg also gets the biggest problem wrong.  He asks "Why hasn\'t all this work resulted in huge blocks?"  It hasn\'t resulted in huge blocks because there is not enough transaction traffic to create huge blocks.  If the blocksize limit was increased to 32mb tomorrow nothing would happen because we don\'t yet have >1MB worth of transactions to put IN the blocks.  You could remove the limit entirely and we\'d still have the same size blocks (unless someone decided to spam the network, which would be expensive).  \n\nAs one reply to that comment says, at it\'s core the post is an appeal to authority.  It uses the imagery of Core devs being skilled mechanics while pro-XT people are uneducated drunk morons making reckless suggestions.

You were the only cool mod left :/': 16, '> Thank you, I really appreciate it. I\'m glad to see that the opinion that I linked, regardless of how valid it may be, won\'t be lost in my soon-to-be-downvoted comment.\n\nThat\'s the problem with this whole discussion- it\'s turned into mud slinging and oppression of views.  That applies both ways.  To be blunt, the anti-XT policies in /r/bitcoin created a lot of that animosity.  You or Theymos can argue it\'s an altcoin on technical grounds, but that doesn\'t change the fact that a LOT of /r/bitcoin members think it\'s VERY relevant, and trying to stop an anti-censorship group from discussing something is never a winning strategy (see also Streisand effect).  That said, I\'m also disappointed that even when an anti-XT person posts a rational, logical post arguing against XT it\'s automatically downvoted to oblivion.  \nWe all support Bitcoin, we just disagree on the path to make it succeed.  We need rational discussion of all the options, including XT, and why XT might be bad.  Unfortunately given a lot of current animosity that is difficult and IMHO probably won\'t happen unless either major changes are made or the block size issue is resolved one way or another.  \n\n> this is about preventing spam from making it impossible for all but the richest people to run a full node.\n\nBut you skip the fact that you\'re throwing the baby out with the bath water.  When we hit 1MB of REAL transactions, then even though poor people can run a node, we\'re necessarily telling some real transactions to get lost and letting them sit in the cache for eternity or perhaps write some code to reject them.  That, IMHO, is not an acceptable way to deal with spam.  \n\nI\'m all for stopping spam.  Remember spammers have to pay transaction fees.  If you want to have a conversation about what a transaction fee should be I welcome that.  If you want to make them dynamic based on network load I\'m not opposed to that discussion, as long as it doesn\'t break that someone can easily and instantly make a payment and have it be relatively well trusted with zero confirmations.  None of this requires artificially small blocks though.  \n\nMore importantly- remember that transaction fees can be easily changed relatively quickly by consensus of miners.  Block sizes cannot, not without months of planning and migration of nodes and miners and other systems.  So it makes sense to raise the block size limit now, before we wish we\'d done it earlier.\n\nAnd if we raise the limit, miners are under no obligation to mine 8MB blocks.  They could keep their own block limits lower, but still accept larger blocks mined by others.\n\n> Does that sound like someone who thinks that we should stay at 1 MB forever?\n\nNo obviously not.  But again that misses a key point- if we don\'t start to act very soon, we\'re not going to have enough time for a responsible low-impact fork before transactions start backing up.  BIP101 will likely take months to get to 75% if it does at all, even if Core supported it tomorrow.  And that says nothing for the proprietary implementations used by exchanges, mining pools, hosted wallets, etc.  All those will need time to adapt.  That time is now (IMHO the real time was back in 2014, or earlier this year, but I\'ll settle for now).  \n\nThis discussion (block size limit, not scalability) has been pushed down the road for far too long (another thing Greg\'s post glosses over).  If we\'d been having a real proactive discussion about this back in 2014, we could have had a solution like "If 6000 of the last 10000 blocks are >500KB, raise the limit to 2MB" or maybe "As of block ${someblockinlate2015} the limit is 2MB".  But it wasn\'t Gavin that kept kicking that can down the road.  It\'s the other devs, who either didn\'t want to talk about it or kept calling for infinitely more discussion with no solutions.  \n\nEven now that\'s what\'s going on.  There official strategy is \'let\'s discuss this more in the workshops which won\'t finish until December, then let\'s discuss it more online so everyone can weigh in, then maybe sometime in 2016 we\'ll have a solution\'.  Well \'sometime in 2016\' we will hit 1MB blocks.  That\'s cutting it too close for me.  \n\nIMHO, the best is the enemy of the good.  Even a quick raise to 1.5MB based on some triggerable logic would be fine, it would buy us another several months during which they can have all the workshops they want.  But I feel like the Core devs are so focused on the perfect answer that they reject the acceptable if imperfect answer.  \n\n> Given the intended audience, it very well should be.\n\nNo, it shouldn\'t.  There are too many well-informed stakeholders in this discussion.  And the whole concept of Bitcoin is to trust hard info and crypto, not people.  "You should believe me because I tested it and it broke" is valid.  "You should believe me because I found flaws and here they are" is valid.  "You should believe me because I\'m smarter than you are" is not valid.  \n\nAnd that\'s the problem with your climate analogy- who says what doesn\'t matter, FACTS matter.  If the one famous guy has good facts and every other scientist has conjecture, then the one guy is right.  I don\'t care if he\'s Gavin or Mike or Greg or some random sk8rb0i1337@aol.com who just subscribed to bitcoin-dev, I will weigh the argument based on its own merit, not the merit of who is making the argument.  \n\nBesides, like the old burger ad asks, "Where\'s the beef?"  Greg\'s post (like so many others) strongly implies there\'s a serious problem with an immediate large raise like BIP101 could implement, but other than more bandwidth for nodes, I\'ve yet to hear a REAL criticism that isn\'t far outweighed by the problems a constant ever-increasing transaction backlog would create.  \n\nAnd more importantly- a personal insult is 100% uncalled for.  It doesn\'t matter if this is the dev list or the used miner auction in some seedy Hong Kong basement.  The obvious reference is the guy with the beer hat is Gavin and/or Mike, both of whom are about as far away from \'drunk moron\' as you can get.  Frustrated and impatient perhaps, but certainly not uninformed or lacking knowledge.  \nAnd to loop back- that sort of personal attack is the type of thing that got us into this mess.  \n\nJust my 2c :)': 3, '*hardleft121* received a tip for 1000 bits ($0.24).\n\n\n--\n\n[^^what ^^is ^^ChangeTip?](https://www.reddit.com/r/changetip/wiki/tipping-on-reddit)': 2, "You say you didn't like it, and weren't good at it and didn't have time.

It hasn\'t resulted in huge blocks because there is not enough transaction traffic to create huge blocks. If the blocksize limit was increased to 32mb tomorrow nothing would happen because we don\'t yet have >1MB worth of transactions to put IN the blocks.\n\nWARNING: Read beyond the first sentence of the below. It is not going to argue what you think it is going to.\n\nTo be fair to him, we also don\'t have 1 MB worth of transactions to put in the blocks yet, but that has happened quite a bit recently. Code doesn\'t differentiate between spam and what you consider to be real transactions. As we have seen with these "stress-tests" (more accurately, Denial-of-Service attacks against the blockchain), if someone *can* generate enough transactions to make us hit the upper limit, there is a good chance that someone *will*. This isn\'t about "conserving resources", this is about preventing spam from making it impossible for all but the richest people to run a full node.\n\nLet me quote a statement that is very easy to miss in that post:\n> But in some sense it has, it\'s created enough headroom that you can reasonably run a node locally with multi-megabyte blocks and have it not immediately fall over.\n\nDoes that *sound* like someone who thinks that we should stay at 1 MB forever?\n\n> As one reply to that comment says, at it\'s core the post is an appeal to authority.\n\nGiven the intended audience, it very well should be.

Core devs say that this discussion is essential before we do anything rashly, whatever action that gets taken must come out of consensus agreement (of the Core devs at least).  \n**//EDIT:  Including as requested:** Core devs also focus on scaling through efficiency, and much effort has been put toward this goal.  They argue that [scaling development has barely kept pace with current blocksize](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3hfgpo/an_initiative_to_bring_advanced_privacy_features/cu7mhw8) and that increasing the block size could cause significant other issues.\n\nXT (Gavin and Mike) argument is that this discussion has been ongoing since 2013, and has been largely ignored by many Core devs for much of that time.  Since any block size increase can cause a hardfork, it must be done responsibly which takes months to do.  And since (if current trends hold) we'll hit 1MB blocks in mid 2016, we need to start implementing a fix now rather than wait another 6 months (at which point it may be too late to do a responsible change).  \n\nMuddying the waters, some of the Core devs are affiliated with Blockstream, a company working on sidechain tech.  If Bitcoin itself gets backlogged, that will mean more business for Blockstream.\n\n**As for open discussion--** Theymos and other mods support the Core devs.  Since XT has the potential to create a hardfork and the resulting chain would be incompatible with Bitcoin-Core, Theymos has dubbed Bitcoin-XT to be an 'altcoin' and thus not permitted for discussion on /r/Bitcoin or BitcoinTalk.

A summary transcript of the point of the video you linked is as follows:\n> Moderator, quoting Hoffman (coincidentally, btw, Hoffman is also a lead investor in Blockstream):\n\n>> "In time, we are going to see the emergence of Bitcoin Googles, Bitcoin Facebooks, Bitcoin Alibabas -- massively valuable companies for which no contemporary analogues exist -- built on the platform\'s foundations of decentralised trust and programmable money."\n\nhttp://www.wired.co.uk/magazine/archive/2015/06/features/bitcoin-reid-hoffman/viewall\n\n> Blythe Masters:\n\n>> "I would say blockchain rather than just bitcoin, but yes, distributed ledger, yes."\n\nThroughout her talk, Masters described cryptocurrency strictly from the standpoint of Bitcoin, but without using the word \'bitcoin\'. Then, at the end of the talk, she asked the audience if they wondered why she didn\'t say \'bitcoin\', and answered her own question by saying it\'s because blockchain can apply to more than just bitcoin. This means to me she is saying there is more than just currency aspect (little \'b\' bitcoin, as an asset that can be transferred p2p); there is also everything else Blockchain (big \'B\' Bitcoin) can apply to (e.g. land titles, wills, deeds, identity, colored coin applications, etc. etc.), based on its properties of decentralized trust and immutable ledger.\n\nFurther, Masters specifically said in her talk that the token (bitcoin) incentivizes the miners (or nodes) to secure the system. So, she is not trying to separate bitcoin from blockchain. She really does understand how bitcoin works (in contrast to most other entities on Wall St. that are still in denial, trying to use it while not really using it -- at least that\'s been their public facing POV), and seems to be validating it, albeit saying also that it requires much more development before it\'s fit to handle the trillions of dollars that she aspires it to via her company (in combination with private ledger tech to help interface with legacy financial systems). -- As an aside, even if it is to handle trillions of dollars, that doesn\'t necessitate bitcoin\'s market cap to be worth trillions (or maybe it does? I\'m not entirely sure).\n\nSo, going back to her final answer to the interviewer\'s question, I think it\'s possible Masters is trying to say it shouldn\'t be called \'Bitcoin companies\', since these future companies\' purpose won\'t really be \'bitcoin\' but rather something that uses the Bitcoin (blockchain) system to deliver a good/service. In other words, I think she was just taking issue with the terminology. Hoffman had also been trying to say that Bitcoin\'s technology would be used in non-bitcoin-as-asset ways by future companies and that those companies will be worth a lot; Masters was just trying to phrase it more accurately by using the term \'blockchain\' or \'distributed ledger\' based companies.\n\nJust my opinion, but I\'m pretty confident I\'m interpreting it mostly correctly.': 3, "They all may just be being conservative, too. They may not want to mention Bitcoin because they can't guarantee Bitcoin will survive, so they want to hedge their words.

I had to watch 2 times since it was easy to get \'bored\' as you said it and lose focus, and it was highly condensed.

In the downward direction the best you could hope to do is provide a transparent, orderly, and (hopefully) as-equitable-as-possible method for them to coordinate in order to discourage the formation of informal coordination which might be much more user hostile (e.g. also involve them coordinating on redlists of coins that can\'t be spent).  To that extent I think the proposal offers something very useful, but it isn\'t an answer on its own.\n\nJeff argues that users can vote with their feet and abandon a system where the mining cartel is not behaving like they want, but I think that argument makes little sense and hasn\'t reflected actual behaviors.  Leaving the system isn\'t a free choice, it involves large costs and frictions, and if it were to happen at any scale would be a thundering mess that creates large losses for many users. Of course, the hypothetical cartel knows this too.  An uncharitable spin on it would be "We don\'t have to worry about miners cartels because people can just stop using cryptocurrency" which is kind of like saying that you don\'t have to worry about falling to your death because you won\'t care after you\'re dead.

": 4, "I'll put it on my list of things to add, although I can't guarantee I'll get to it any time soon because of its lack of popularity (it seems like Adam is the only one who advocates for it). I haven't studied it in depth yet so currently don't have thoughts on it.": 1, "Given the freedom of miners to vote up and down, don't you think combining bip101 with bip100 (replacing the 32mb limit) be the most logical and sensible approach to achieve consensus?  The hard limit won't be effective without the soft one.\n\nMakes sense to me just to put both in, or neither.": 1, '> It\'s possible that that miners won\'t cooperate outside of the protocol for fear that users would see it as illegitimate and would punish the miners, \n\nYes, though that is also a reason to provide a coordination mechanism-- so that other kinds of coordination will be seen as illegitimate.  There is a hierarchy here: if you provide no process for something than any process can be invoked and described as urgently needed. "Something must be done" "This is something" "Then it must be done".   You also can\'t just provide a coordination mechanism that is so ineffectual that it does nothing or that gets dismissed as nothing at all.\n\nKeep in mind that there is no reason "informal" coordination needs to be especially detectable: "Do what we want, or your blocks have a 6% orphan rate instead of a 3% orphan rate" "Oh what do you mean? We totally didn\'t intentionally orphan that block!". It\'s also important to not over-state the ability of users to punish... if that ability exists at all it only does so under a fraction of possible futures.   Certainly, "screw you, we\'ll change POW" exists as a threat. But might be too much like the "we\'ll stop using Bitcoin threat"... so costly as to be potentially empty.  In particular, there is a counter threat of e.g. pretending to be a bunch of users saying they won\'t go along with the POW change, resulting in a ledger split.\n\nI do also agree with the general concern (esp expressing 100) as a "vote" that it legitimizes otherwise illegitimate behavior. Say there was neigh-universal agreement that signaling X was very harmful to Bitcoin users but to the benefit of miners. Miners say "So what, my vote!", perhaps too many users say "Well, they have a point." instead of "Hey, that is not how this should work!"?  I had some older proposal that suggested something BIP100 like but hoped to provide concrete guidance on best effort miner behavior (e.g. directing them to increase it when various indexes went up or decrease it if they went down)-- even though the system itself can\'t judge legitimate behavior here the users could.   But as a proposal it was kind of a dead fish in flight tests: those who have a stronger belief that Bitcoin should be byzantine secure and not depend on users to protect it didn\'t like it, and those who see no risks in this space just saw extra complexity,... though who can\'t see the tradeoffs are inherently political through it was a political imposition, etc.\n\nI agree with that expectation setting RE: POW. I actually proposed to the litecoin community that they change POW to prevent ASICs because <s>no-gpus</s> no-asics was clearly part of their day one social contract. But as I\'ve said for these other things, I a threat isn\'t effective unless it has real teeth and people believe it has teeth, and it\'s not clear that this can have them.  Especially when determining legitimate vs illegitimate can be so hard. This is also amplified in a world where users depend on third parties to run nodes, ... do you think $BIG_EXCHANGE is going to spearhead a move to a new POW to stop miners from applying proof-of-passport based filtering on transactions?\n': 9, 'I agree that if giving miners a way to coordinate within the protocol discourages coordinating outside of the protocol, that can be good. I do think that it\'d be even better if miners did not coordinate at all right now. \n\nSo IMO the main question is: how likely are miners to coordinate outside of the protocol if we don\'t give them an easy way to coordinate within it? It\'s possible that that miners won\'t cooperate outside of the protocol for fear that [users would see it as illegitimate and would punish the miners](https://bitcoindebates.miraheze.org/wiki/Power_ultimately_rests_with_users), either by leaving or by an anti-miner hard fork (which I think is more likely). If so, then BIP 100 makes things worse. If miners would have otherwise coordinated outside the protocol, then something like BIP 100 makes things better.\n\nIf miners are actually afraid of punishment by users, then BIP 100 might indirectly allow the economic majority to get the system they want. It\'s like hooking up a horse to a wagon. The naive objection is "Are you crazy? You\'re letting the horse determine where you go? The horse\'s interests are not aligned with yours -- it will just take you both to the nearest pile of hay!", ignoring that there\'s a person in the wagon with a whip.\n\nIMO we should try to set a strong expectation in the Bitcoin community that if a large fraction of miners ever behaves badly they can expect a change to the PoW function. This does allow an attacker to harm existing miners by temporarily getting a lot of hash power and doing bad things, then forcing everyone\'s mining hardware to be made worthless, but it seems like that attack doesn\'t hurt Bitcoin users that much aside from harm stemming from whatever short term bad things the attacker engaged in.': 3, "This may be a little off topic but would you have link to a proper security analysis of the block extension proposal from Adam?\n\nI remembering reading you weren't convinced but I went over it again over the last few days and while it seems to contain considerable complexity to implement I can't help but think this is the best chance we have of enforcing a strongly decentralized layer from where users will be given a choice to move from. ": 1, "Do you have a better idea or are you just making noise?\n\nThe block size NEEDS to be raised.  This is not up for debate.\n\nEDIT: Sorry, that was a bit harsh, so I'll take my downvotes.  The point stands though, there is no denying we need to increase the blocksize.": -10, ">TLDR: BIP 100 claims to put block size under control of a free market but puts it under control of a cartel instead.\n\nYou're jumping to conclusions. \n\nA truly free market would not restrict blocksize AT ALL, the problem is that the maximum blocksize keeps the blockchain from getting bloated, the older nodes from being overrun by blocks too large to process and propagate, and people from trying to game the system. \n\n\nHow about this for a cartel example: Who protects the network? \n\nANSWER: THE MINERS\n\nSo basically there's a networks security cartel right now! (by your definition)\n\nLook, we need larger blocksizes, but we also need a voting system that cannot be easily swayed. Mining at the moment is extremely expensive to influence. What alternatives can you give that would give such protections on someone trying to influence the system?\n\n##Here's a couple of alternatives:\n- Proof-of-Stake, where minted blocks vote - PROBLEM: EXCHANGES AND LARGE HODL'ers CAN OWN THE SYSTEM!\n- Nodes vote - PROBLEM: Nodes can be made, a dime a dozen and then taken down immediately after the vote is taken\n- Transactions vote - PROBLEM: Miners can make transactions that don't propagate the network and only are included in blocks they mine!\n\nThere is an alternative that sucks, nobody would want it, but it's an alternative.....LOST BITCOIN VOTING.\n\nThat means you vote for increasing or decreasing the the blocksize based on how many coins you throw into an irretrievable address. (Like what was done for counterparty)\n": 1, "> Leaving the system isn't a free choice, it involves large costs and frictions, and if it were to happen at any scale would be a thundering mess that creates large losses for many users. Of course, the hypothetical cartel knows this too.\n\nI think /u/jgarzik's idea is that this deterrent would encourage miners to respect limits desired by users, ie that miners need a good Bitcoin price so they wouldnt push things too far towards their profit at Bitcoin users' expense or the price would fall as users sold Bitcoins.\n\nThat seems correct however I do agree with what you said that there is much friction there.  One way to look at it is miners could reduce block-size to discover the switching cost of users.  It's common practice in cell phone and other networks for competing providers to raise prices to optimise their profit.  The switching-cost being the point at which users jump ships to a different ISP or cell phone provider.  The switching-cost is the degree of inconvenience to the user (eg lose their address book, change their phone number, hassle of cancelling a contract, cell phone company makes it intentionally difficult to cancel etc).  In Bitcoin a risk might be the switching cost could be quite high because there is no alternative, if it's Bitcoin or USD/paypal.  We dont know what the optimal miner profit point is, could be good or bad for users.  What's the switching cost in a natural monopoly like a global currency.\n\nWhat seems fairly sure is that this gives quite a bit of control and pricing discretion to miners, and that miners are not necessarily in direct alignment with users or eco-system companies.  On the plus side it's fairly simple.\n\nThere were some other variants that proposed a user-vote also, which seems perhaps more balanced.": 18, '3 people operating pools deciding blocksize is surely the free market!\n\nBIP 100 can downvote size at anytime in Bitcoins future lets say it was at 2mb capacity at some point and needs raising well it quite as easily could be voted down whatever is most profitable.\n\nThe point is if you believe in the mechanism then it should be released without a 1mb floor so it could be voted lower on release for that will always be the potential at any point going forward with BIP 100.': 5, 'Could a dynamic block size limit work? For example, if we have a full block (say, the current 1 mb limit), the next block will automatically be 25% larger. And if the next block is still full, the one after that will be 25% larger than that. And so on. If blocks are not full, they will then decrease by 20% each time, bringing them to their prior state. That way the block size will always tend to equilibrate around the current transaction volume.': 2, 'It seems to me the more important concern is about them raising the block size. Matt Corallo has explained the potential outcomes of a free floating block size more than once  and I fail to see how these miners votes proposals are any different.\n\nLarge miners will trivially add hashing power behind their "vote" and likely precipitate as much as they can the rise of the block size to choke smaller players out of the game.

But each wallet category offers different features and capabilities. Web wallets are dependent on a centralized provider for normal access, and so are the most centralized of Bitcoin wallet choices available. Should the website become unavailable or the provider go out of business, you may need to use a recovery procedure and start another wallet before you could use your bitcoin funds normally again. On the other hand, web wallets can be accessible anywhere you have access to the Internet without requiring a particular device that has the instance of the wallet client software on it (assuming the web wallet service provider is not down, of course).  \n\nDesktop wallets like Electrum are not fully dependent on any one single centralized service. In particular, Electrum wallets can run connected to any of many available Electrum servers, and should one become unavailable, it will automatically access another (or you can even elect to run your own).

Since cold storage takes some familiarity, choose a cold storage option, and implement and practice using it with small amounts at first to become comfortable with all of the steps (including, for instance running the offline Electrum instance from a secure and always offline PC, or alternatively from a PC booted to a standalone secure environment like TAILS).  \n\nNormally, independent wallets like a GreenAddress wallet and an offline instance of an Electrum wallet are not "connected" together.
