As the "real" spot price moves up from <$600 to >$600, the prediction market prices should just flip from ~ 100% below 0% above... to 0% below 100% above.\n\nTo see why, imagine that there\'s no time value of money and all the contracts are priced in dollars and pay $1 if true, $0 otherwise. Say the parameter is something like $700, the current prices say 60% below and 40% above. While this implies that the current market price should be just under 700 somewhere, say that the actual market price is just $300. The strategy is to break a single dollar, and use part to buy the "over cheap" PM price, and the other part to buy or short actual Bitcoin. In this case, take a dollar and spend 60 cents on below (which should really be 100 cents) and then just spend 40 cents on actual Bitcoin itself.\n\nWhat can we expect to win, if we follow this strategy?

But I assume that is what you are saying, because your comment isn\'t that clear to me. What are you saying exactly?\n\nI am saying that it is important to keep things at balance. Users *will not* seek for the balance because the other end benefits them a lot more with very little *immediate* cons. And the other end is also bad but it\'s a lot easier to move from there towards the another end (to gain the balance between these two.)\n\nThe two ends are roughly "network security" and "TPS, UX, low fees".\n\nGoing too far into the "TPS, UX, low fees" -end will make Bitcoin Paypal 2. And it\'s *very* hard to fix that if it ever starts falling there. That is because for majority of users Bitcoin will work *just like before* but with lower fees and more TPS. This is called permissioned ledger.\n\nAnd the other end is also very bad: Overkill technical network security. There wouldn\'t be that much users because fees would be a lot higher. And that would obviously be very bad for the system. \n\nSo we need to find a good balance between these two. Funnily, current 1MB blocksize limit is pretty close to that, IMO. It could be increased quite a lot before we hit the other end badly but all the time when we weaken the network security, and make the network less decentralized, we\'re moving towards the other end. And as said, it\'s a lot harder to move back from there.\n\nBest solution would be to keep blocksizes low enough and use Lightning. That is actually the only proper solution. We can\'t increase blocksizes so there\'ll be low fees all the time. If bitcoin userbase 100x\'d now, Bitcoin couldn\'t handle it even if we 100x\'d blocksize limit to 100MB. We would have permissioned ledger then, aka. PAYPAL 2.': 1, "If most people are pro-redlisting then that will be added/accepted. But if most people are against it then it will never become a thing. I personally think redlisting is the most naive and stupid idea ever for bitcoin.

But naive and stupid doesn't mean that Mike has bad intentions, i think those ideas come from a good place. \n\nAnd considering lighting and the block size limit, its actually pretty simple. Lighting doesn't exist. Every person who mentions a non existent solutions should get a slap in the face. And what also should merit a slap in the face is saying that 100% of users could transact if the block size isn't increased. But I assume that is what you are saying, because your comment isn't that clear to me. What are you saying exactly? \n\n": 1, 'Moore, nielsen, more pressing centralisation forces and orphan risks all make the "> 1mb == OMG centralisation" argument completely moot already. But if you can talk about lightning, then I can surely talk about techniques to transmit found blocks faster. If anything completely obliterates any argument to keep the 1mb limit its that. \n\n> There wouldn\'t be that much users because fees would be a lot higher.\n\nI never understood people who say "just increase the fee" as a way to make small blocks ok. As if more fees would magically help to fit more transactions in the same blocks. \n\nSo yes, if block size limit is completely removed and actual block size becomes so big that just one miner could handle them then you have the situation you describe. Just ignore that every other miner would orphan those blocks. Or that it wouldn\'t make any economical sense to completely destroy bitcoins value by centralising bitcoin that way. \n\n> Funnily, current 1MB blocksize limit is pretty close to that, IMO\n\nThat makes me think of this quote by Douglas Adams:\n\n> Imagine a puddle waking up one morning and thinking, "This is an interesting world I find myself in \xe2\x80\x94 an interesting hole I find myself in \xe2\x80\x94 fits me rather neatly, doesn\'t it?
