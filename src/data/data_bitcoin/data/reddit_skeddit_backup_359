Which is a bit worrisome </sarcasm>, because no business on Earth that caters to thousands of clients uses a real-time auction to define its price.\n\n> Since the amount of the transaction is dependent on the time of day and day of week, price of byte in the blockchain will also depend on these parameters. It is possible to calculate the optimal price for each hour a day every day of the week.\n\nThe traffic certainly *varies* a lot according to the time of day and day of week, but is not predictable from them.  \n\nAs long as the network is far from saturation, that unpredictability is irrelevant, and fees are irrelevant, because all unconfirmed transactions in the queue could be processed in the next block,even if they pay the minimum fee.  \n\nBut, when the traffic gets momentarily higher than the capacity of the network, a "traffic jam" -- a backlog of unconfirmed transactions in the queues -- will form.\n\nThe start, size, and duration of a traffic jam cannot be predicted from past history, because it depends on the excess of traffic over capacity, which is much more variable than the traffic itself.  (For example, if the capacity is 2.1 tx/s, a traffic surge with 2.3 tx/s will generate a jam that grows twice as fast as a surge with 2.2 tx/s.)\n\nThen the fee that is needed to get your trasnaction into the next N blocks will depend not only on the state of the queue, and on how many transactions ***will*** be issued in the next N x 10 minutes; but also on the fees that ***will*** be paid by those transactions -- which will *not* be the minimum fees, because the clients issuing them will be trying to get them ahead of your transaction.  \n\nSo, one cannot write an algorithm to compute a fee that, during a traffic jam, will have a good chance of getting confirmation in N blocks.  For the same reason that one cannot write an algorithm to predict the bitcoin price 10 minutes ahead, or the bid that is guaranteed to win a closed-bid auction:  the data that one would need in order to compute that value will not be available, and will not be guessable, even in theory.\n\nA network that is saturated, even only part of the time, is a broken network.

The term usually refers to the *intrinsic* value of something that can be used for exchange, and means that every unit of it is just as good as any other.  So you don\'t have to worry about *which* units you own (or owe, or are owed), or which kinds or units, but only *how many* of them.  \n\nNational currencies are fungible by decree.  Gold, gasoline, cocaine paste, and refined sugar are mostly fungible.  Apples, gold jewelry, diamonds, postage stamps, wine, and coal are not fungible (although oil and coal of a specific technical grade may be fungible). So bitcoin is indeed fungible, in the sense that any satoshi is equivalent to any other.\n\nWhat makes stolen money different from a stolen car is not so much that "the receiver is not liable" or "the owner cannot demand it back".  It is the way the victim can get it back.\n\nIn the case of theft of money, the owner must accept as restitution *any* money with the same value, taken from the thief.  If the thief spent the money, then the equivalent amount is recovered by auctioning the thief\'s property.  If that is not enough, the victim has to bear the loss.  Anyone who accepted the money from the thief, *in good faith*, is not liable.  The same may (or may not) apply to theft of other fungible goods, like gold or sugar.  And the same usually applies to borrowing: the borrower is obliged to return *the same amount* of the stuff, not *the same stuff*. \n\nWereas, in the case of a stolen car, the victim is entitled to get back *that* car, not any other "equivalent" car; because it is very problematic to try to define and find an "equivalent" car.  If the car has been destroyed or cannot be found, the victim may be entitled to get from the thief, as above, a sum of money that some court will establish as its fair value.  \n\nBut if the stolen car has been sold, it *may be* taken from the buyer (depending perhaps on the jurisdiction), who would then have to try to recover the money from the thief.  The justification here being that, since each car is identifiable, and its ownership can be established by documents and official records, the buyer has some responsibility to make sure that the seller indeed owns the car.  So the difference between the two cases is somewhat related to fungibility, but not identical to it: it has more to do with the existence of external proof of ownership of a *specific* lump of the thing.\n\nNevertheless, if you receive money that you have good reason to suspect is stolen, you may be considered acessory to the theft -- fungibility or not fungibility.  That is the spirit of AML laws.  \n\nThis principle normally applies also to bitcoin or any other property.  The difference between bitcoin and money is that bitcoin motions are recorded in a *public* ledger, and bitcoins cannot be spent without connecting to that ledger.  Therefore, if governments were to create offical public databases of \'forbidden\' bitcoins, they *could* require everyone who receives bitcoins to look them up in that database, and report any match; or be charged with money laundering etc..\n\n': 0}, ('So.
