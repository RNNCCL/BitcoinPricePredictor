Nobody wants to be the guy that spent the equivalent of $2.5 million on a pizza.': 6, 'Here\'s how I usually explain what Bitcoin is and why it matters:\nThe reason it\'s so hard for most people to understand Bitcoin is that most people don\'t really understand money. Money isn\'t wealth. It\'s an accounting system used to facilitate the exchange of wealth. (The paradox of money is that while everyone wants it, no one actually wants it - they want the stuff they can buy with it!) Many people are put off by the fact that bitcoins are "just 0\'s and 1\'s" But that\'s what ALL money is, information! More precisely, money is a means for credibly conveying information about value given but not yet received (or at least not yet received in a form in which it can directly satisfy a person\'s wants or needs).\nTo put it yet another way, money is a ledger. With fiat currencies like the dollar, that ledger is centralized. And that gives the central authority responsible for maintaining that ledger tremendous power, power that history has proven will inevitably be abused. With Bitcoin, the ledger is decentralized. And that means that no one individual or entity has the power to arbitrarily create new units (thereby causing inflation), freeze (or seize) your account, or block a particular payment from being processed. We\'ve had decentralized money before. After all, no one can simply print new gold into existence. And the "ledger" of gold is distributed because the physical gold itself (the "accounting entries" in the metaphor) is distributed. But with gold, that decentralization comes at a heavy price (literally). The physical nature of gold makes it hugely inefficient from a transactional perspective.\nEnter Bitcoin.\nIt is the first currency in the world that is BOTH decentralized AND digital. It is more reliably scarce than gold, more transactionally efficient than "modern" digital banking, and enables greater financial privacy than cash. It could certainly still fail for one reason or another, but if it doesn\'t, it has the potential to be very, VERY disruptive.': 72, '> Ordinary retail banks do not fear Bitcoin - Central Banks do.\n\nYes this is true.': 2, "M'liquidity": 1, 'Because of the network effect, the most useful "settlement blockchain" is the most widely used one, which is currently Bitcoin by far.\n\nSure, banks could create their own blockchain, which would be relatively easy, but getting enough other banks and organisations to start using the same one is the difficulty.': 5, 'Spend and rebuy.': 30, "Many people like you are only interested in investing in Bitcoin. You convert a fraction of your income into BTC and hodl. There's nothing wrong with that. \n\nBut there are a few, myself included, who receive 100% of our income in BTC. We can't hodl all of it. We'd starved to death if we did. So we spend it, just like we spend any other money. Of course we want to support Bitcoin as well, so we look for merchants who also believe in BTC and send our business to them first. Then we look for businesses that might not truly believe, but at least accept. Then we look for services that act as middle men and allow us to interface with more of the world.  And finally, for those increasingly fewer expenses where Bitcoin is not an option, we begrudgingly convert to fiat.\n\nJust remember. You may think you're a super investor and that you're doing something special by hodling the small amount of BTC you're buying. But you're not a true believer unless you're all in. And if you are all in, then you've got no choice but to spend. ": 7, 'So, is this something worked on?': 2, '> Clearing is the process of actually moving money from one account to another to "settle" the transaction. When you swipe your card to pay for a coffee, the money isn\'t moved immediately. The bank just notes down that it needs to shift cash from one account to the other and sorts out all these thousands of transactions across all its accounts at the end of each day.\n> \n> But with Bitcoin, the so-called "blockchain" software underpinning it makes transfers instant. When you buy something with Bitcoin the digital token is moved immediately to the other party\'s account and the deal is recorded in the blockchain, which acts as a public ledger shared across thousands of systems.\n> \n> Banks are desperate to figure out how to apply this technology to mainstream currencies and the likes of Citi, UBS and Santander are all looking at blockchain technology.': 7, ">Hoarding/saving and earning is what gives a currency value - spending does the opposite.  You can only spend a currency because someone else is willing to earn/hoard it.\n\nCompanies and people don't sell goods and services with explicit goal of hoarding. They sometimes chose to invest percent of money into some instrument, e.g. bonds or even cash. Ideally people don't want money. They want services and goods. \n\nYours truly, C.O.": 0, "Yes, but it said became, not 'is'.

If she comes around and doesn\'t mind you holding onto it or spending some here and there, keep REALLY GOOD records of each time you acquire or buy some, including the date, how much you received valued in US dollars and when you sell or spend some later on, how much you spent or sold, the date you spent or sold it, its value in US dollars and how much the BTC that you just spent or sold went up or down in value while you held onto it. This is very important to do in the US and may not make it worth it to ever spend any. Remember, you don\'t have to tell anyone about any BTC you\'ve received no matter how or why you received it -- only when you sell or spend some and only if it went up in value while you held onto it.\n\nI keep every BTC purchase in a separate HD wallet so it is easy for me to figure out the value when I bought it vs when I sold or spent it. If you buy or receive BTC periodically and put it all into the same wallet (either paper or HD), you will find it is difficult to identify which BTC you sold or spent when you sell or spend more than your most recent purchase had left on it. When every purchase is paired up with its own sales in a single HD wallet, you can easily document how much you paid for each BTC and how much it was worth as you eventually spent or sold all of it -- even if you didn\'t spend it all at once.

Instead of worrying about how hundreds of websites are securing your credentials, you are the only one storing them.\n\nEdit: Just did a little research into BitID and it seems very similar.  probably listens to the podcast, lol.  only difference is where the keys are stored.  one in a bitcoin wallet, the other in a standalone app.  Honestly I'd be down for either to have good implementation, but I'd be inclined to think SQRL might end up with the higher market share strictly because of the audience exposed to it and the fact that he has used a lot of clever methods to secure the app that holds your identity.

The token encrypts it with a secret key it holds locally in its hardware. The token uploads the keypair to the server encrypted, plus the public key unencrypted. In this process, the browser or app tells the device which SSL certificate the site uses, which used used as an input (don't remember the exact details). \n\nWhen authenticating: when you enter your username, the server will send your encrypted keypair for that particular site to your token via your app or browser and a challenge to sign a unique nonce. This request comes along with the details about the server SSL certificate and about the active SSL session.

Before I was just pretty careless and I kind of regret that now... some stuff was needlessly merged.\n\nEverytime I hear people say things like 'and then I just moved all the funds to the new wallet', I cringe. I even went to the length of migrating single inputs to separate adresses within the new target wallet when I was getting rid of an old qt wallet once.

One of those inputs is the tiny amount I sent you earlier.  I now know you control the other addresses used as inputs in that transaction as well.  \n\nIf I spam these tiny transactions to a lot of addresses and watch them, you can start linking together lots of addresses which assists deanonymization.": 7, 'For ex., if an extortionist (say, the IRS, or any lower, local level gang) links you to one of the 6 addresses (by watching any identifiable transaction you make with any of them), this extortionist already know the balance you are holding in the other 5.': 1, 'Yep.

Generally speaking though the empty addresses are the main vulnerability.": 1, 'Not necessarily. Let\'s say you were careful to only use an address once, only receiving once per address. Let\'s also say you\'re careful when spending to use only one input and have two outputs: one the payment, and one a "change address", which is also a new address controlled by you. Now, multiple spends from the same original input can be pretty easily linked, but each of your original receive addresses are unlinked (we\'ll ignore here how to separate multiple spends from the same original input as well as how to combine (or spend in the same transaction) small change UTXOs without linking them to an attacker\'s perspective for the sake of simplicity; there are various strategies for this but I think it\'s out of scope here).\n\nCompare that to having some tiny inputs added to an old, now-empty address along with a lack of coin control. The empty address would never have been re-used, and so there is no additional information available to an attacker for de-anonymizing that address apart from the existing transactions coming out of it. By adding that tiny input to it, the attacker can now observe an additional transaction linking that address to other addresses with more coins, and so we can link original receive addresses which would not have been able to be linked based on the strategy described above.': 1, "You, like, so clearly just don't get it, man.\n\nif I have an old address that isn't used anymore but my wallet client still recognizes it as my address, and it gets sent .001 btc, suddenly I think I have .001 more btc in my account. let's say I spend my 1.001 btc from an untainted coinbase transaction - it's unlinked to any one person besides the miner (who decided to stay anonymous). \n\nNow, the old address with an output of .001 and the untainted 1 btc is linked. it is now highly likely that the previously anonymous coins are now linked with my old wallet that had .001 btc sent to it.": 4, 'Okay, sorry for being repetitive.

What kind of stuff do you think they might do?  I certainly don't expect them to come out and say their methods openly, but I think it's a safe assumption blockchain forensics is a part of it, and the behavior we're describing here is basically an active form of blockchain forensics.
