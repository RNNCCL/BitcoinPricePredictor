There is only one tx fee, but it's used in two different ways. First when deciding whether to relay, and second when a miner builds a candidate block.\n\nMost wallets just punt on the issue and use a hard-coded fee to avoid confusing users. Having seen umteen dozen posts here about transactions being stuck for not paying a high enough fee, I can't fault the wallets.\n\nIn summary, to know the relay fee, you need the length of the transaction in bytes.

If prior to the hardfork you had 1.0 bitcoin (BTC), then after the hardfork you still have that 1.0 bitcoin (BTC) but also 1.0 of the unit that is spendable on the side with the "big blocks" such as what Bitcoin-XT can create.  For clarity, let\'s call that new coin BTX then.\n\nSo your 1.0 pre-fork bitcoin (BTC) gets you, post-fork, 1.0 BTC and 1.0 BTX.   But Circle, Coinbase, etc are only on the hook for the longest chain, so they allow you to sell or withdraw your BTX.

You used two things that are not related and tried to make them related by saying "look, there\'s a vix ETF with an 85% of the shares sold short".  That doesn\'t mean that you can simply go and sell BTC and continue selling and shorting BTC into infinity and expect to profit from it.  You are making the large assumption that BTC will simply continue to go down in value into eternity.  That\'s a very big assumption and one you can\'t defend.\n\nAlso, you didn\'t provide the specific ETF so I can\'t even go behind you to check the short interest and make sure you\'re not making it up.  On top of that, an 85% short interest in a VIX etf would mean that most people felt the VIX would continue declining further, but it\'s already right around some historically low levels, 12-15 range.

All it will take is a week of the stock market declining and the VIX will be up over 20 and every one of those shorts will be deep in the red.\n\n>proper analysis of VIX and futures contango check\n\nNo, actually you are specifically talking about a VIX ETF, not VIX futures or contango.

Fully verifying nodes are not going to be a permanent presence in cell phones, 1mb or not. It's just not going to happen. The sooner people wake up to this fact and realise that the sky is not in fact going to cave in on them like chicken little continually rants on about, the sooner we can move on to more important things.\n": 2, 'Unfortunately it will have to become easier, cheaper, and more interesting for people to run full nodes.\n\nI run one, but only because I have a laptop performing all sorts of internetsy, backup and and media serving tasks.

They\'re happy to trust Apple with all of their payment details because they don\'t want to have to enter it separately for each and every app or service.
