Try reading the specifications for HTML standards, you'll cry, it's worse than legal text.

But many of us write /u/changetip 1 bit and use bitcoin nonetheless. My point is, bitcoin.org is in some ways 'too nice'. It could've just been a purely technical website aimed at developers.

There is enough entropy there that you can scan all transactions looking for public keys in the blockchain to find this  address that starts with this and "1j2453adb".  It is most likely only to ever point to one address (You can calculate the odds if you really want to) so you can verify the coin contents are still there.  Technically it is possible to create another public address that starts with the same short code thereby looking like the coin is funded but it would take so long to do it\'s incredibly unlikely to happen.  I expect you can also just pick up the oldest transaction to extract the real address as the chance of it happening randomly would be 0% so you know it would be the later transaction that was trying to be deceptive.  (There may also be a db of coin shortcodes to full addresses somewhere but will let others chime in here)\n\n\nThe important part is this is obscuring the private key hidden underneath.\n\nNow that private key is a compressed format like you say.  For elliptic curve private keys they are 2 co-ordinates put next to each other (X,Y) on a graph.  The thing is that with just the X value you can \'almost\' work out the Y value of the private key.  I say \'almost\' as the value may be positive or negative so you also need to store this information.  I.e. a compressed private key is just the X component and a single bit to say if the Y value should be positive or negative.  \n\nThis means the private key is just as secure as the uncompressed key, simply more efficient to store it.\n\nSo from a \'playing the numbers\' approach the coin is just as secure as any bitcoin private key. \n\n\nAs swmich73 points out however, this private key was created by someone else so you are trusting them to not have written it down.  I believe Casascius to be very reputable as he has been very open about the process and how these private keys are destroyed.  If he didn\'t do this no one would buy them and just one theft would ruin the business.  Given he is a bitcoin advocate I\'d like to believe he\'s true to his word but yes this is a risk here!\n\n\nTo avoid this risk you can buy coins that you write the private key yourself but these are likely to be far less valuable than Casascius coins since you need to build the trust that you destroyed this private key.\n': 2, 'How short is the key? If you have a series 1 coin and the key is only 22 chars then entropy could be an issue since the keys are only around 128 bits.

You\'re thinking of the public key. Compressed private keys aren\'t actually compressed, they just contain a flag to indicate the compressed representation of the *public key* (and address) should be used. Compressed private keys are actually larger because of this added flag (52 vs 51 chars).\n\nCasascius keys are "mini private keys". They contain a smaller checksum, and also less entropy than a normal private key. The series 1 coins used a 22-char key which is only around 128-bits of entropy. If OP has one of these I\'d be a little bit worried but probably not enough to move the funds unless it\'s a large amount. Since then they use 30-char keys with entropy more than 160-bits so it\'s not an issue (addresses are capped at 160-bits of entropy due to the use of RIPEMD160).\n\nDecoding a mini key is pretty much the same as a brainwallet: real key = sha256(minikey)': 1, "With the bit about compressed keys, you're actually talking about how compressed *public* keys work.\n\nThe answer to this question is very complicated.

You'll mostly be working with various theories, writing papers. e.g. Bloom filters arises out of language-agnostic research.\n\nIf you want to work on apps like wallets, you have to consider the backend and the frontend (like for most projects). Roughly speaking the backend is server-side stuff. Facebook for example runs on the server, it processes all your behavior. If you 'like' a page, it's registered on the server. The frontend happens in the browser, if you like a page you do this behavior in the browser, the server sees it, registers the like. Then when friends run FB in their browser, they'll get a message from the server saying you liked something. Roughly speaking the backend is where a lot of the architecture and computation happens, the front-end is where the pretty user interfaces happen. Back is slightly more 'codey', and front is slightly more 'designey', but it's more subtle than that.\n\nI'd say not many people start out with the backend. Usually you start with making very simple frontend apps that don't even require a backend. Like a calculator app. Then you add some backend server tech to it (like the ability to save calculations on a server (in the cloud), and load them up on another device). And then some people switch to backend dev if they like that experience.\n\nSo I'd start with Javascript. Popular, easy, pretty powerful too, employable, and lets you build bitcoin apps from day one. Then move to NodeJS for backend stuff. With things like Phonegap (+ AngularJS, Ionic, etc) you can easily build apps with JS for iOS and Android.\n\nIf you enjoy it, along the way you'll have learned something about the protocol and about the pros n cons of Python, Java, C++ etc. But Javascript to me is a powerful, yet beginner-friendly, massively popular, truly cross-platform language.\n\nIf you're saying 'I just want to do iOS' and nothing else, jump in with Objective C.

If not, you'll want to send a moneyorder, it's just $2 to pay your $40 phonebill, 5%. That's a lot of money, imagine you had to live with a 5% tax. There's a reason we're moving away from cash, it's because electronic payments are easier. But while cash is open to all, electronic payments are closed to those who have bank accounts, and not everyone can get them. (look at the excellent mini-documentary Spent: looking for change on youtube)  But bitcoin offers electronic payments using an open protocol that anyone can use. Beyond that it's cheaper and faster, too.\n\nDoes that mean everyone should be using bitcoin right now? No. That's not really the case I'm making here. In fact I would advise a lot of people (particularly vulnerable ones) to stay away from bitcoin right now particularly because it's risky, requires a lot of effort and isn't even cheap and easy in some cases. I'm just talking long-term here: digital payments are going to be better than physical payments, no question, and a solid open payment network is more fair and inclusive than a closed one (not better necessarily, but at least more fair and inclusive), no question. \n\nAt the end of the day bitcoin isn't such an amazing improvement in the developed world. I'm in the Netherlands, I can pay and receive money for free, instantly, virtually any amount, to people hundreds of miles away, and my bank account costs something like $20 per year. I'm not going out of my way to use bitcoin in my daily life. But billions of people don't have access to such a financial system. The best they have is making in-person payments with a crap currency, little security, and big limitations and costs when receiving or sending money over longer distances than the length of their own arm. For them bitcoin could soon be an interesting idea. Look at Kenya for example, 70% of the country's payments are done using Mpesa, a form of electronic money sent with featurephones. But its average inflation has been 15% or so the past 6 years or so. That means you would've lost more than half of your money in the past few years. And if you want to send $6 with Mpesa, say to pay for a week of school tuition, it costs you about 10% for the transaction. It's absolute shit, yet Kenya & Mpesa are considered a huge success, a leading example for much of Africa, because many other countries are in an even worse condition. But with bitcoin you could, using Bitreserve, peg the value to the dollar for 0.45%, hold it for years at low inflation, and spend it completely for free, without needing a bank account or whatever.

When two neutron stars orbit each other closely, they spiral inward as time passes. When the two neutron stars meet, their collision leads to the formation of a black hole (assuming their combined mass exceeds the Tolman\xe2\x80\x93Oppenheimer\xe2\x80\x93Volkoff limit). This creates a magnetic field that is trillions times stronger than that of Earth, in a matter of one or two milliseconds. Astronomers believe that this event is what creates certain kinds of gamma-ray bursts.[7] Images taken by the Hubble Space Telescope suggest that gold is yielded, along with many other heavy metals, from a violent neutron star collision. These collisions, which happen once every 10,000 to 100,000 years in this galaxy, may account for all the gold in the universe.  \n\nOf course, all the gold on earth was formed billions of years ago.\n\n\nHow Bitcoin is created:  \nBitcoins are created as a reward for payment processing work in which users offer their computing power to verify and record payments into the public ledger. This activity is called mining and is rewarded by transaction fees and newly created bitcoins.  \n\nThe successful miner finding the new block is rewarded with newly created bitcoins and transaction fees.[39] As of 2014, the reward amounts to 25 newly created bitcoins per block added to the block chain. To claim the reward, a special transaction called a coinbase is included with the processed payments.[10] All bitcoins in circulation can be traced back to such coinbase transactions. The bitcoin protocol specifies that the reward for adding a block will be halved approximately every four years. Eventually, the reward will be removed entirely when an arbitrary limit of 21 million bitcoins is reached c. 2140, and record keeping will then be rewarded by transaction fees solely\n': 1, "Oh, I see, you're right.

This thing FEELS important.  And it LOOKS valuable.  So, when people see this thing in my office, they pick it up and ask what it is.  I tell them it stores bitcoin.  Their reaction is usually "Wow!

A number of small double spends would be easily detected and the statistics would be enough to get articles blaming the pool for being complicit which would shake confidence.

With 51% of the network, you're still competing with the other 49% unless you are maliciously withholding blocks, in which case my previous point would stand.  So unless you are maliciously withholding blocks, you can only mine a double spend 51% of the time.  Then, if you have 1 confirmation, it drops to 26% (since you have to mine the last block again).  With 2 confirmations, it's 13%.  With 3, it's 6.7%; 4, 3.4%; 5, 1.7% and 6, .89% (less than 1% chance).

Even with 20% of the hashing power, there's a 20% chance you will mine the next block.  So while technically you are correct, in practice it's not a large threat, especially if you generally follow the OP's guidelines to how many confirmations to wait for based on amount.  \n\n51% is not a very big threat, even with a single miner owning it all (as opposed to a pool), unless they were malicious and wanted to break bitcoin.

Which is essentially theft since the free market doesn't decide what that value is.\n\n> they inhibit this fragmentary risk, which is the biggest risk to mass adoption of cryptocurrency.\n\nI think encouraging Bitcoin to live on multiple chains increases fragmentation of the Bitcoin chain, as multiple ones become necessary for its operation in different domains and for different systems. It is also not the biggest risk to mass adoption by a long shot.\n\n> Cryptocurrency would not be able to compete against fiat currencies, with their government monopolies, if it saw effective hyper inflation via market fragmentation across an ever increasing number of blockchains, each with their own coin supplies\n\nThere is no indication that this is happening, or that it will happen. Bitcoin's value is derived in part by the cumulative hashing power of its network.\n\n> Sidechians also allow Bitcoin to scale. \nThis is true, its one possible way of scaling horizontally. There are many others.\n\n> Regional sidechains used for small value transactions don't need to be as secure as Bitcoin mainchain, and could offload much of the small/microtransactions, without introducing Trusted Third Party payment intermediaries like Coinbase that are extremely easily captured by regulators.\n\nOr you could just use Bitcoin. What if a side chain becomes the required conduit for regulated transactions?\n\nGood intentions and all that. I understand where you are coming from but alt coins serve most of the purposes you state, and for the ones it doesn't we could just use Bitcoin and scale it properly.": 1, "> I don't think side chains are particularly innovative. I think they add risk, and provide little economic benefit. There is very little difference between a side chain and an alt coin,\n\nThey add no risk as they have no effect on the main chain. They alleviate the risk of the cryptocurrency market fragmenting along dozens of blockchains, some innovative, and some mere forks of each other. By allowing the coin supply of Bitcoin, the dominant cryptocurrency, to incorporate new features, they inhibit this fragmentary risk, which is the biggest risk to mass adoption of cryptocurrency. \n\nCryptocurrency would not be able to compete against fiat currencies, with their government monopolies, if it saw effective hyper inflation via market fragmentation across an ever increasing number of blockchains, each with their own coin supplies.\n\nSidechains also allow Bitcoin to scale without causing resource requirements for running full nodes to increase exponentially. This is important for every aspect of cryptocurrency. Regional sidechains used for small value transactions don't need to be as secure as Bitcoin mainchain, and could offload much of the small/microtransactions. The alternative to sidechains is Trusted Third Party payment intermediaries like Coinbase that are extremely easily captured by regulators. \n\nEven the Hub and Spoke microtransaction payment channel system advocated by Peter Todd as an alternative to all other proposed scalability solutions can be captured by regulators (while creating a huge privacy vulnerability), as the Hubs are centralized parties that gain utility with size (therefore have a tendency towards centralization).\n\n\nPutting all of this aside, why do you oppose people having the option, yes **option**, to use a feature that has no technical effect on the Bitcoin blockchain? No one would be forced to use this option. Why do want them to not have the option altogether?": 1, "Well I think that changes to Bitcoin core should be considered in both their technical and economic context. The system's success is largely due to these carefully tuned incentives, miner block incentives, transaction fees, etc. As well as speculation as to the increasing utility of the network. When we introduce features that could alter that incentive structure, or create a mechanism to migrate out of Bitcoin into another chain, we need to very carefully consider what that means.\n\nIf it continues to grow there will be increased regulation, and there will be external forces trying to exert influence. I worry that we may be inadvertently creating a backdoor into the eco-system via the two way peg that doesn't serve the economic interests of the network.\n\nI'm not sure how to prevent corporate interests from inserting themselves into Bitcoin. To a certain extent that is already happening by virtue of the fact that core developers need to make money also. If all of them had ridden  the bitcoin train to billions that wouldn't be the case and financial motivation and pressure would be decreased. I think all I can advocate is vigilance, and an open dialogue with these companies that isn't completely  dominated by fud. Lets discuss things on both technical and economic merits since we are dealing with a system that is a hybrid of both.": 2, "> Bitcoin mining rewards diminish over time, and will be supplemented by transaction fees. \n\nAnd they will not rise sufficiently to provide Bitcoin with adequate security unless transaction volumes rise substantially. A major barrier to increases in transaction volume is the growth in resource requirements for running a full node with blocks bigger, which harms Bitcoin's decentralization.\n\nSidechains are a way of giving miners a means of earning transaction fees by increasing the total volume of transactions they validate while mining Bitcoin without causing the resource requirements for running a full Bitcoin node to skyrocket.\n\n>Decentralized SideChains that generate transaction fees for miners will alow miners to attack one chain even Bitcoin's blockchain and earning BTC while doing so.\n\nMerge-mined sidechains can be attacked, but that's nothing new: merge-mined chains are always vulnerable to attack from those mining the main chain. It's extremely unlikely it will threaten Bitcoin however. Bitcoin will benefit from the sidechain activity as the centrally located blockchain in the Bitcoin sidechain ecosystem, so its blockchain will have the most value being transacted on it, leading to it to being the highest fee generator.\n\nIt is far far more likely that the increased mining revenues for Bitcoin miners from sidechain merge-mining will improve security, by increasing the network hashrate.\n\n": 0, "> There are no technical ramifications given this can be implemented via a soft fork\n\nTrue. But my concerns aren't technical in nature. The perverse incentives and conflict of interest are the problem, not the technology.\n\nIf the founders of Blockstream are willing to relinquish their commit access to Bitcoin Core upstream, I would have **zero issues** with sidechains. Well, are they willing to do what's right? Money is involved... draw your own conclusions.": -1, "This is interesting, people don't seem to be asking the right questions about side chains and what it is really trying to accomplish, and whether those goals are actually desirable.": 5, "> No they don't. They are alt coins. They alleviate no such risk, t\n\nYes they do. They are not altcoins. They use the same coin supply as Bitcoin. They preserve the digital scarcity of the 21 million bitcoins. \n\nThey are also interoperable with Bitcoin, through their p2p conversion mechanism, which makes sidechains effective extensions of the Bitcoin blockchain. The interoperability counteracts the breakdown of the network effect that comes with the market being divided across multiple blockchain.\n\n>It doesn't incorporate any new features. The side chains are not bitcoin.\n\nThe bitcoin currency can effectively make use of new features when the Bitcoin blockchain obtains sidechain functionality. \n\n>There is no indication that this is happening, or that it will happen. Bitcoin's value is derived in part by the cumulative hashing power of its network.\n\nThere is a major risk that new altcoins, with new features that Bitcoin doesn't have, will take market share from Bitcoin, because Bitcoin is not able to quickly adopt their features. This would harm the value of bitcoin currency.\n\nIt's blindingly obvious that enabling sidechains that can allow bitcoin currency units to effectively be used in other blockchains with different protocols will allow Bitcoin to maintain its market advantage in the midst of innovation.\n\nThe alternative of relying on Bitcoin main to do a hard fork and incorporate every new feature that comes along, and quickly enough to head off a loss of market share, is extremely fragile.\n\n\n>Or you could just use Bitcoin. \n\nI explained why it's better to use Sidechains via an edit, that you may have missed:\n\n>Sidechains also allow Bitcoin to scale **without causing resource requirements for running full nodes to increase exponentially.**\n\nAnd finally, my question:\n\nPutting all of this aside, why do you oppose people having the option, yes **option**, to use a feature that has no technical effect on the Bitcoin blockchain? No one would be forced to use this option. Why do want them to not have the option altogether?\n\n\n": 1, 'Good piece.': 3, 'Judge their work based on the code, not conspiracy theories. As it is, you suspect Satoshi of being a CIA agent and have been telling people Bitcoin is a one-world-government currency being promoted by the elite.': 2, "Let me start by saying, I like the idea behind the two way peg, but **I would be much more comfortable with sidechains if the founders of Blockstream did NOT have commit access upstream**. Let me tell you why.\n\nThe incentive structure they are introducing to Bitcoin is unprecedented and ultimately I do NOT trust any private company, Blockstream included, to have my best interests in mind when the government comes knocking. So my primary concern with sidechains has to do with trust.\n\nGoing back to the reason for creating sidechains: that the main Bitcoin protocol is hard to change. What assurance do we have that, if a sidechain is successful, its innovations will be introduced back to the main chain? The incentives of Blockstream are perversely aligned to **prevent** innovations on sidechains from flowing back into the main chain. Or, since the Blockstream founders have upstream commit access, instead of preventing those innovations from coming back, they can pressure the innovations to come back in handicapped forms. They have very strong VETO powers upstream.\n\nNow, you might point out the founders of Blockstream probably own 10,000 BTC a piece so what incentive would they have to destroy Bitcoin's value. But it isn't that simple. For example, you could argue Bitcoin could go to $10,000 per coin while at the same time blacklisting any transactions that are deemed politically unpalatable. And what if that's actually true? Are you willing to censor your fellow man to make yourself rich? Many, and dare I say MOST people **ARE** in fact willing to fuck over their fellow man on the way to riches. When money is involved, you can't trust anyone to act altruistically. **Bitcoin was designed to preclude the need for altruism to come to concensus, yet we have a private company with upstream commit access to Bitcoin Core**. Think about it.\n\nThe majority of programmers I've encountered are Statists, this is even more true in the Silicon Valley startup scene. If the State ever bears down on Blockstream, you'd have to wonder whose side these Bitcoin Core developers with a **dual allegiance to Blockstream** will take. Care for a glimpse of that? Look at the pitiful way they treated Jon Matonis when he was first vying to represent Bitcoin to the press at Bitcoin.org. Look at the first two responses by Luke-Jr and Greg Maxwell respectively:\n\n> NACK, Matonis publicly encourages using Bitcoin for illegal activity and makes statements effectively daring governments to ban Bitcoin (such as claiming they can't do it).\n\n> There are currently already eight people listed\xe2\x80\x94 its more than a screen-full on my system.\n>\n> As I've commented before, I think we need to be listing moderate voices. The press will find more extreme views, no doubt about that, but we don't want to be in a position where views like that are expressed as being fundamental to Bitcoin. An ideal primary press contact for bitcoin.org is someone who is saying the things that just about everyone involved with Bitcoin agrees with\xe2\x80\x94 even if thats a little boring.\n>\n> FWIW, I hear from Jon that he is already receiving too many media requests. Perhaps this makes leaving him out more palatable for folks who aren't moved by the leave-the-politics-out-of-it arguments?\n\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin.org/pull/162\n\nYou will surely find the entire thread revealing. Go read it now and then tell me if you trust Greg Maxwell and Luke-Jr to stand up for your rights when they're pressured by the establishment. What reason do you have to trust these people beyond their coding skills? Yet these people have a clear conflict of interest in that they have a **dual allegiance** to a private company and to Bitcoin Core development, which they can VETO or steer in any direction at their whim.\n\nRemember, it was recently revealed the NSA will have a $1,000,000,000 annual budget for corrupting open source software in 2016. There is by all accounts NO ROOM for a private company to be steering the development of Bitcoin. It's just plain dangerous.\n\nIn a world where large mining facilities must be trusted to point their hashing power at merge mined chains for them to be secure, if any sidechain were to grow in popularity, and a government didn't like it, the government could raid that large facility and force them to stop mining the side chain. Without the large mining facilities, the sidechain would be insecure, and the two-way pegged funds would be at risk of being stolen. The government could leverage its threats to manipulate sidechains in more sinister ways, like forcing the makers of a popular sidechain to implement user tracking features.\n\nIf Blockstream devs VETO popular innovation on sidechains from making it back into Bitcoin Core, then they prevent those innovations from making it back into Bitcoin Core, **which actually helps their business model**. That would force people onto sidechains which would be easily controlled by governments. Governments would love sidechains because it effectively gives them total control over the outcome of all Bitcoin innovation.": 6, '"A Digital Currency Fund Specializing in AltCoins"\n\nThey\'ve made a bet that Bitcoin will not be the winner, and that could lead to bias affecting their commentary.\n\nThat being said, I agree with much of what Lukas Ryan says. One factor I believe he\'s missing is that sidechains can be partially backed by bitcoin and have multiple \'distributed consensus\' (I hesitate to call PoS distributed consensus) protocols securing them simultaneously. This largely solves objections 1, 2, and 3 that he raises.\n\nFor instance, Ethereum could become partially pegged to Bitcoin as a sidechain, where its native currency and bitcoin-backed coins need to be combined at some ratio to create the active currency that can be used on the Ethereum blockchain. That would preserve the initial Ethereum investors\' stake, while providing a much easier avenue to transfer capital into the Ethereum ecosystem. It would also provide an incentive to Bitcoin stakeholders to support the Ethereum sidechain, because of the partial bitcoin backing that its active currency has, and reduce their incentive to support a Ethereum fork.': 3, 'i have already proposed that to them and they have summarily dismissed that notion as being "unreasonable".  draw your own conclusions.  mine weren\'t favorable.': 1, "Very interesting post. It leaves me wondering what we can do to raise awareness of these incentive issues with Blockstream and sidechains.\n\nBitcoin is quite clearly on the NSA's radar and they'll soon have a $1,000,000,000 annual budget to corrupt it and other software.\n\n**How can we keep perversely incented corporate interests out of Bitcoin Core**?

I do think that the economic and technical ramifications of 2 way pegging have not been thought out by the community at large.

Settlement however is a whole different situation. Settlement via Paypal can take weeks or even months, as they must take into consideration scammers, fraud, or theft, so they need to have the power to reverse transactions in these cases. This means settlement of transactions can take weeks or even months. And even after Paypal has reassured you that you have received the transaction, that transaction could be reversed months later.\n\nBitcoin settlement on the other hand is much MUCH faster than Paypal as it is a push style transaction compared to Paypal's pull style transaction.\n\nAs I said, Bitcoin can send transactions instantly, and you can watch this in realtime. It literally takes seconds for the transaction to propagate through the network of nodes, settlement however is a different matter, as the receiver usually likes to be certain that the transaction can't be reversed before they consider the payment settled as there is no-one to protect them from fraud. This is usually after 5-6 confirmations which can take from an hour to maybe as long as 6. For Digital items that can be revoked 0 confirmations is acceptable, but merchants sending physical items they prefer to wait an hour or 6 to feel fully reassured that the funds are in their control. Intermediaries like Bitpay are options for merchants where Bitpay assures 100% payment with an instant confirmation to avoid waiting times, but the key here is it is optional for the merchant.

Just one more reason why they have to be reasoned with on their own terms.\n\nWould you ever hear of someone putting their life-savings *in apples?* No, but it has happened often in bitcoin.\n\n> People buying Bitcoins for $300 today don\'t necessarily care about the shortage of supply, some people are using them for their utility as a cryptocurrency, the same utility that can be performed by literally any other cryptocurrency if for some reason lunatic Bitcoiners begin demanding $2000/BTC when other available options exist.\n\nSure but the network effect and path dependence make that unlikely, including the fact that there\'s no such thing as an expensive bitcoin. Again, if you put $2000 into one bitcoin you didn\'t just *lose $2000*, it\'s still there in bitcoin. Higher or lower price doesn\'t really matter unless you\'re in it for deflationary gains. For the average person who won\'t much care about that and just use it for its advantages as a cryptocurrency, who cares.\n\nBut that\'s not a reason to switch to a different cryptocurrency either.\n\n': 3, 'Wake me up when you learn to read.': 0, "> You dark to explain why miners would suddenly start buying bitcoin as a result if rewards halving.\n\nBecause a good predictor of whether the price of bitcoin will rise in the short term is whether the most efficient miners can make a profit mining.\n\nI admit it surprised me when I first heard a pro miner group explain what they actually do in relation to price. When price goes under their cost of coin production, they don't stop mining, they just stop selling and start buying. The buying is a hedge and to cover costs on the back-side after the price rises (they hope) for the time that they are not covering costs by not selling.\n\nSo they essentially are borrowing on bitcoin by buying at a lower price that they expect must rise.\n\n> A miner is in the business of converting electricity into bitcoins they can sell for profit. When revenue halves, they will need to reduce their overhead cost or face diminishing returns. Them suddenly buying bitcoin has nothing to do with their business, and I think there are more professional miners today than last time. So miner vs enthusiast vs investor is more distinct this time around. \n\nEven if miners don't buy bitcoin the logic still works, since they will stop selling. But I think if you look into it, all sorts of former miners have begun buying after their miners became no longer cost competitive.

But there is no influence going the other way: the miners can starve or choke on caviar, the price will not notice.\n\nYou have to admit there's at least one connection: miner's supply much of the daily bitcoin sold on exchanges. How will miners react to a BRH? They won't sell bitcoin at a loss, they'll hold them instead. So we'll be facing a shortage of 3600 bitcoin a day after the BRH. How many bitcoin are sold on exchanges each day? And how many of these come from miners? And how many of the secondary and tertiary transactions are previously mined coins?\n\nI honestly don't know, but I assume it's a good portion of them. We could be looking at a 2/3 drop in market offerings without miner's putting their BTC on the markets.\n\n> \n> \n> \n> The reward halving should have a positive effect on the derivative (slope) of the price, by reducing the number of BTC dumped on the market by miners every day. That it, the price may drop more slowly from that moment on, or rise faster.\n\nTrue. But we also have to figure expectations into this, and those expectations are strongly influenced by BRH2012. Which means everyone, including miners, will expect prices to rise strongly.\n\nThat could mean a lot of whales trying to sell into strength, or trying to engineer a bear-trap instead.

I count that as part of the BRH price increase.\n\nPerhaps then miners will be wary and simply not add more mining power even as the price increases in the months ahead of time, but in either case the result should be a price increase during 2016 of roughly double.": 3, "> Postulating that the miners will stat buying Bitcoin instead is simply preposterous. Why would they do that?! \n\nIt's not a postulation, it's what an employee of one of the big professional miner groups told me they actually do. They do it because they know that if they can't make a profit selling bitcoin (because they're already a lowest-cost producer) then neither can anyone else and that should mean a small supply shock to bring the price up.\n\n> They already have more bitcoins than they could sell for a profit.\n\nIf they expect the price to rise soon as a result, it's a rational thing to do. What's more it increases demand slightly.\n\n> Why exacerbating their losses by buying more of a losing asset?\n\nYou're assuming it's going to go down, they're assuming it's going up. They may have seen it happen enough times that they feel confident investing along those lines. \n\n> \n> \n> \n> None of the above is likely to have any significant impact on the Bitcoin price. Miners going out of business would reduce the supply increase further, but could also reduce demand, as confirming transactions takes longer and/or costs more.\n\nNah, confirmations don't end up taking longer in either case.\n\nSo your theory is that halving the mining reward supply will have zero impact on price.\n\nHow do you explain BRH2012 then?": 1, '>It didn\'t happen in BRH2012, why do you think it would suddenly happen the next time.\n\nThe money into and people involved with Bitcoin is so different this time around that I don\'t think the two events can be compared at all. We\'ll have to wait and see. Miners\' weren\'t being compensated anywhere near the same amount of money when the block reward was twice what it is today but the price was only $10 or $50 bucks. \n\n>It\'s not quite arbitrary, it\'s an unstoppable event. \n\nThese aren\'t mutually exclusive. \n\n>And remember, price doesn\'t really matter. You put $30 into bitcoin and you now own $30 worth of bitcoin. All that changes is how many decimals of bitcoin that turns into. So it\'s not as bad as you seem to think.\n\nExcept the $30 you put into Bitcoin could just as easily be $30 into whatevercoin. As much as the price doesn\'t matter neither does the network, a cryptocurrency is a cryptocurrency. For functional purposes short-term "investments\' into Bitcoins indeed make the price irrelevant but you\'re not really talking about that, you\'re talking about miners holding their mined Bitcoins hostage for $x000 each when the same functionality can be found in any other altcoin, and don\'t kid yourself into thinking other altcoins wouldn\'t see the same use if the aforementioned hostage situation were to occur. You\'re painting a picture that it\'s no big deal to offer continuously-increasing rewards to miners simply for running their computers and wasting electricity and processing an absolutely meager amount of transactions and that\'s total nonsense. \n\nI\'ll spell this out for you as clearly as I can - the general public won\'t be "duped" into the artificial scarcity you\'re so eager to buy into. There\'s a certain level of open market demand for Bitcoins at $300 and probably quite a bit more support of under the table trading support at $100-$200 but there\'s no fucking reaosn whatsoever that John Public will be forced to pay exhorbitant and unnecessary "scarcity costs" for a digital and inherently non-scarce cryptocurrency. It won\'t happen. People aren\'t that stupid. If PayPal or Western Union today claimed their overhead had increased by 50% and they were expecting people to pay double you earnestly believe those customers wouldn\'t look elsewhere? Bitcoin isn\'t any different and it isn\'t a matter of Bitcoin being proprietary or the only game in town where your argument might hold some water. \n\n> Bitcoin is limited in supply to 21 million bitcoin and mining produces a strict daily schedule that average about 3600 coins mined a day... I assume you know this\n\nOf course I know this. You completely missed my point. Bitcoin is arbitrarily limited to 21 million units. It\'s an artificial scarcity, just an arbitrary limit to a number of non-physical units that are by their very nature infinite. Data is for all intents and purposes infinite. There is no limited number of web page accesses for the internet or limited number of emails, convincing people that there is a limited number of Bitcoins (though true) and that is somehow inherently valuable is a fool\'s errand. You can convince libertarians and goldbugs but you can\'t convince the general public you\'re counting on paying double for some bullshit they\'ll never buy when other options exist and will be heavily advertised\n\n>Sure but the network effect and path dependence make that unlikely\n\nMore people have seen The Smurfs 2 than participate in The Bitcoin Economy.

It\'s a poor store of value for any recent users and this trend may continue through 2015 and into the halving. \n\n>*For the average person who won\'t much care about that and just use it for its advantages as a cryptocurrency*, **who cares**.\n\nI bolded the part you need to read over a few times to really see how out of touch with reality you are at this point. Who cares what the average person thinks? Who cares about the functionality to the average person? The average person is the guy you\'re counting on putting that $2000 into Bitcoin and they arent doing it as a store of value. Maybe they\'re doing it for remittances. Maybe Litecoin can do the same remittance for a fraction of what Bitcoins cost because Litecoin miners aren\'t greedy like Bitcoin miners? All that\'s missing is a LiteCoinPay and for Circle to implement Litecoin and the miners can ruin Bitcoin for all anybody cares, VC companies like LitecoinPay and Circle would still make their cut on the cryptocurrency du jour. \n\nI\'m going to bed now but holy shit you\'ve given me a good chuckle tonight. Who cares what Average Joe thinks or cares! He\'ll pay whatever we say for bitcoins because of the super-limited supply! After all there\'s no way any functionally-identical technology can be overtaken by a competitor!\n\nImagine Bitcoin is MySpace and they suddenly decide they are running out of pages and so instead of paying $1 for your own page you can now pay $10 to have part of another guy\'s. You still get the same content, just a smaller resolution. There\'s no difference right? please don\'t sign up at Facebook! Network effect! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n': -1, 'although at last halving the price started going up just about at the same time.': 2, '> This isn\'t inconceivable at all. I frankly don\'t think many bitcoiners would disagree with me. Miners are overpaid, it shouldn\'t cost nearly $15 per transaction to process a payment network. I\'m not trying to sound accusatory but you sound like you\'re white-knighting an industry that literally just wastes electricity.\n\nCompared to what? Are you suggesting that Visa uses less electricity than Bitcoin. Laughable. Banks? Do you have any idea how many banks there are in the world? How much energy going into producing and running a single bank branch, much less all of them? Not even to mention that the bitcoin mining industry uses literally the world\'s most efficient computers to process transactions.\n\n> \n>>And again, miners will stop selling rather than sell at a loss, so it won\'t be $500k lost to the market, it will be $1 million worth of bitcoin lost a day until the price rises enough for them to begin selling again.\n> \n> \n> \n> This, too, is amazingly shortsighted. \n\nIt\'s what happened in BRH2012. \n\n> Miners have bills to pay. \n\nDo you think companies simply shut down when they can\'t meet their bills? That\'s not how business works every time. Sony didn\'t make a profit for years in a row and still hasn\'t shut down. How much easier would it be to actually plan for the BRH that you know is coming. Hell, if I were a mining company I\'d already be saving bitcoin for it, thus pricing into the BRH ahead of time.\n\n> When the music stops and people aren\'t willing to pay $400 a bitcoin they sell for $350, then $300. They aren\'t going to be racking up hundreds of thousands of dollars in electrical costs in some mexican standoff with bidders trying to extort some ridiculous profit margins out of hands for no reason other than arbitrary scarcity.\n\nThis is like the buttcoin equivalent of some bitcoiner claiming $5,000 / coin in jan 1, 2015. When the BRH comes and miners don\'t shut down ludicrously as you claim here, I\'ll come toss it in your face.\n\nRemindMe! 83 weeks. "Happy BRH!

It\'s possible because they could see it coming and prepare for it. A rational miner should think to save up a good 4 months of operating expenses at least in prep for BRH2016. Your thesis rests on them ignoring that the BRH is even about to happen and doing no prep at all.\n\n> If Bitcoin becomes a game of few miners unwilling to let go of coins for less than $900 each\n\nThose are called long-term holders (until price-point X).\n\n> and people amazingly aren\'t willing to pay that then bitcoin loses it\'s value and utility \n\no_O that\'s not how bitcoin works.

So the price could even fall, at least temporarily.': 2, "Your whole logic is just wrong.\n\nFirst of all, let me note that the price of a good depends on the dynamic balance between four things:\n\n1) Supply of that good.\n\n2) Demand for that good.\n\n3) Supply of money.\n\n4) Demand to hold money.\n\nNote that the production costs for producing the good do not enter the equation directly except in the sense that they affect 1). The price of Bitcoin is set by the free market, balancing these 4 factors. Halving the difficulty would decrease the inflation rate of Bitcoin but might not be sufficient, by itself, to drive the price up (let alone double it), depending on how the other 3 factors change.\n\nRegarding the miners, they are businesses. They do what they do for a profit. It doesn't matter whether the profit is high or low (that's a personal decision for every particular business) - what matters is that no business would do something at a loss for a reasonable length of time. If the cost of producing bitcoins increases above their market price, one of the following will happen:\n\n1) The miners will reduce costs (either by finding a cheaper energy source or by switching to a more energy-efficient hardware).\n\n2) The miners will stop mining bitcoins (they might switch to mining some other cryptocurrency or stop mining altogether).\n\n3) The miners will demand transaction fees that compensate them sufficiently to make at least a small profit.\n\n4) The miners will go bankrupt.\n\nPostulating that the miners will stat buying Bitcoin instead is simply preposterous.

Stores that accept bitcoin have no reason to accept whatevercoin--they\'re cryptocurrency base is already covered, bitcoin is, has, and will suck the oxygen out of the room, altcoins on lifesupport now will die. The only altcoins that matter going forward are ones that aren\'t trying to do or be what bitcoin does and is, things like namecoin or darkcoin that have angles and purposes bitcoin doesn\'t, and these will integrate as sidechains in time, making bitcoin even more valuable compared to altcoins.\n\n> As much as the price doesn\'t matter neither does the network\n\nBut user buy-in does, ala network effect and path dependence.

From an investment point of view you\'re correct. However what I was trying to get across is that if the price of bitcoin rises to $1200 and stays there, that\'s not suddenly "expensive" unless you expect that price to be unsustainable. It\'s just the current price. If you expect the price to actually rise from there, then it\'s cheap.

Bitcoin has often been a poor store of value for short-term investors. However for long-term investors it\'s been consistently amazing. You can\'t lose money by holding bitcoin for less than 2 years thus far. If you bought at the $33 runup, then 2 years brings you into the $265 runup and balance of $100, if you bought at $266, one year brings you to the $1200 runup and balance of $600 down to $300 today. \n\nAt least you\'re honest about your caveats. \n\n> \n> \n> \n>>For the average person who won\'t much care about that and just use it for its advantages as a cryptocurrency, who cares.\n> \n> \n> \n> I bolded the part you need to read over a few times to really see how out of touch with reality you are at this point.

I just don't think they are reasonable assumptions. Overall demand and public interest in bitcoins has been falling, I don't think that's questionable. it's not unreasonable to imagine that another nearly two years down the road there are plenty of early adopters selling out combined with the reduced block reward to satisfy the (lower) demand, not necessitating some ridiculous price doubling. \n\n": -3, "> You're assuming it's going to go down, they're assuming it's going up\n\nAnd what are they going to do when their assumption turns out to be wrong?

You can\'t subsequently trade an apple as the end consumer and it will rot regardless. Not so of bitcoin. Apples are terrible money.\n\n> What Joe Public is willing to pay directly dictates your level of demand\n\nJoe Public buys $50 worth of bitcoin and receives $50 worth of bitcoin with which he can buy $50 worth of *anything*. Thus price doesn\'t matter. Transaction cost of that purchase might matter, but not the bitcoin price. Bitcoins could be worth $5 billion each and it wouldn\'t damper their use as currency. $50 of bitcoin at $5 billion each is still $50 worth of bitcoin.\n\nSurely you realize this.\n\n> you can\'t arbitrarily raise the price and assume Joe Public has a correlated increase in demand at that price simply because you\'ve told him the supply is limited.\n\nFor investors or products generally this is true, for its function as a medium of exchange it\'s false. \n\nI\'ll just assume you\'re talking about speculators buying it for expected price gains and go from there. Yes, speculators will be concerned about arbitrary price gain.\n\nBut this isn\'t arbitrary, it\'s price gain caused by the BRH, an event to which there is no going back from.\n\n\n> A limited supply is only valuable when it\'s actually respected, the limited supply of Bitcoins is about as well respected as a Limited Edition Ford Explorer.\n\nThe BRH should be a "respectable," as you put it, supply change, because it\'s permanent.\n\n> \n> \n> \n>>If the majority of bitcoin-exchange market supply is coming from mining, which currently seems to be the case, and that supply halves, that\'s a supply shock.

This is a really terrible assumption.\n\nNot all, just a large portion.

None.\n\nOf course not. No one\'s talking about guarantees, only likelihoods. No one knows the future. \n\nBRH2012 is the only empirical BRH event either of us can reason from. And at least in that event, miner\'s kept mining.\n\n> \n> \n> \n>>We\'re talking about taking 1800 bitcoin off the market per day, that\'s a huge chunk of supply. All the market exchanges will be hit with supply shock.\n> \n> \n> \n> This is still assuming that despite a falling price and stagnant transaction volumes there will continue to be a demand exactly equal to all the bitcoins mined each day up until the halving,\n\nNot assuming that at all, that fact creates the current price, whatever it will be. You say this as if I claimed the price would continue to be $300 as it is today, I\'m not saying that at all. If the price is $5 on BRH day, it should still tend to double afterwards. From the beginning I\'ve been price agnostic here, don\'t start pretending I said $300 on BRH day.\n\n> and that all mined bitcoins are being sold at market value further reinforcing that value.\n\nMined bitcoin not being sold are largely irrelevant anyone, they don\'t figure into supply and thus price.\n\n> I just don\'t think they are reasonable assumptions. Overall demand and public interest in bitcoins has been falling, I don\'t think that\'s questionable. it\'s not unreasonable to imagine that another nearly two years down the road there are plenty of early adopters selling out combined with the reduced block reward to satisfy the (lower) demand, not necessitating some ridiculous price doubling. \n\nThat\'s largely immaterial to my question though. I\'m asking about the effect of the BRH. Nothing about the BRH is likely to affect demand.\n\nI never said doubling of today\'s price, only the price at that time.': 1, "P2\n\n> All that's missing is a LiteCoinPay and for Circle to implement Litecoin and the miners can ruin Bitcoin for all anybody cares, VC companies like LitecoinPay and Circle would still make their cut on the cryptocurrency du jour.\n\nGood luck with that.

Higher price is something Joe's looking for, because it means stability and legitimacy. He's not buying it as an investment but as a medium of exchange, and for such buyers price is immaterial because $50 in bitcoin equals $50 worth of goods bought with bitcoin.\n\nAs bitcoin transitions from a speculative investment to ordinary economic activity, that's the kind of bitcoin buyer that's going to be out there buying bitcoin, to transact with, not to horde for value.\n\n> \n> \n> \n": 2, 'You know, the price have more than doubled in the past.\n\nI think you have a fundamental misunderstanding of supply and demand.\n\nAnd please, it would be time to leave behind the fallacy of "true transaction costs". \n\nMining is a self regulating process, if miners do not like the "profitability" then they will drop out. Their associated costs does not have anything to do with the costs of transactions.': 2, 'The price went up far more before the first halving, though.': 0, '> Just as a curiosity, can you outline for me your predictions on this growth?\n\nYou take me for a fool. My only major predication some-time ago was that [$100+ was the \'new normal\'](http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1curhd/the_ddoser_has_utterly_failed_panic_selling/) and it hasn\'t dipped past that since then.\n\n> We\'re at $315 today, you\'re talking about the price doubling due to the block reward in 2016. What is your prediction for the price before and after the BRH?\n\nYou\'ll ntoice I didn\'t talk about what the price may be in 2016, saying only it essentially had to double, whatever it is. Or mining needs to half, or some combination of the two so that mining and price and in equilibrium again. That is a necessity. \n\nWhat the price is, is largely immaterial. But it\'s a lot easier for the price to double than for half the miners to give up.\n\n> At what specific interval would you worry the market isn\'t having a favorable reaction to the halving? If we\'re at $500 at the beginning of 2016 and $525 the month before the halving would you still think the price is going to double the next month?\n\nNo, I think it\'s quite likely speculators will price into the BRH well before it happens due to the price increase experienced in BRH2012.\n\nBut it\'s also possible that this kicks off another period of market exuberance leading up to a price spike yet again. Such spikes aren\'t entirely positive for many reasons, especially as rhetorical fodder for buttcoin trolls like you.\n\n> \n> \n> \n> You and Throwahoymatie are talking about "the price" as if its some sentient being aware of the date of the halving.\n\nThat\'s ridiculous.\n\n> The price is a function of the demand for bitcoin\n\nNo, demand AND supply, only we normally think of the supply as relatively constantly inflating at a low level. However the BRH is a true change in supply, halving newly mined bitcoin.\n\nWhat remains an open question is how much of current market supply is newly-mined bitcoin. Although that could probably be answered by some data researcher, not something I\'m capable of however.\n\n> and if there\'s a continuing lack of demand to buy bitcoins at these prices I\'m failing to see why "the price" should inexplicably rise\n\nAgain, simple economics. Price is the intersection of supply and demand. If demand remains constant and supply halves, the price must rise. Tell me you at least understand that much about economics. It\'s literally economics 101.\n\n> because of some arbitrarily scheduled date and not as a direct result of an increased demand to, you know, actually buy Bitcoins.\n\nIncreased demand or reduced supply, either will create a price increase.\n\n> \n> \n> \n> Basic economics tell you a limited supply, when it is desired, can be valuable. Further limiting that desired supply would increase the value, but I don\'t really see much demand for Bitcoins at these prices let alone enough to indicate that halving the supply would directly lead to a doubling of the value.\n\nAgain, from the perspective of the miners, they don\'t simply stop mining. They keep mining and also *buy bitcoin* themselves. Not only do they reduce daily supply considerably, they also raise demand themselves. That affects everyone looking to buy. Price isn\'t magical at any level. Bitcoin at $300 is the same bitcoin at $1 and $3000, the difference is supply and demand. \n\nPrior to BRH daily supply was 7200 and price was about $12. Demand has certainly risen since then, and the first BRH brought price up to $266 within months of the BRH (market exuberence), down to $70 after, and $100 for most of the rest of the year, a roughly 8 times price increase from before the BRH.\n\nYou\'re wondering why people would pay more? Why are they paying more now compared to our recent past? Answer that and the same will hold true in the future.\n\n> \n> \n> \n> If the halving were to occur tomorrow I don\'t think you\'d suddenly find people willing to pay $600-$700 per bitcoin overnight and in my humble opinion I don\'t think that much will occur between now and the halving that the outcome will be very different.\n\nThe fact of permanently more scarce new bitcoins is a reason to pay more. That\'s the definition of lowered supply.\n\n> \n> \n> \n> I\'ve got fifty apples to sell every day at the market and I get rid of six or seven every day for $4 each. Next week I\'m only going to bring 25 apples and I\'ve notified everybody they are going to be probably going up to $8 each. The people who didn\'t buy my apples before continue to not purchase my apples and the people who did buy my apples before are wondering why I\'m expecting more money for a low-demand item. \n\nApples get used up in the course of eating them. Bitcoin don\'t get used by using them to buy things. You have to stick within the realm and reasoning of money. People buy apples to eat, generally. People buy bitcoin to trade for items, not consume personally.\n\nIf you want to reason about bitcoin with apples you\'d be far better off taking a distributor\'s point of view. He buys apples to trade, much like one would use bitcoin.\n\nLet\'s say you\'re an apple distributor. An apple-blight hits which makes all apples more scarce for that season--this sort of thing happens all the time. And he\'s perfectly willing to buy apples for $5 each if he thinks he can make a reasonable amount of profit on them. If his buyers are telling him they can sell apples for $7 a piece, he\'s willing to buy at $5. You don\'t care what the price is as long as the value is there.\n\nPrice increases come because people will buy apples within a price certain range. But apples have a certain amount of price elasticity regardless, and price elasticity doesn\'t apply to currencies. That\'s the problem with your analogy.\n\nIf a bitcoin is $300 or $300k, you don\'t *lose money* by buying bitcoin in the same way you\'d be getting a bad deal by paying $30 for an apple rather than $3.\n\n$3 for an apple is *consumed* along with the apple. Paying for a bitcoin, at any price, is not consumed in the act--as long as the price doesn\'t subsequently go down. And in the case of the BRH, that BRH is permanent.': 4, 'No...? The price was $12 iirc going into 2013, and that was *after* the halving in late November. From there it shot up. For much of that year the price was single digits.

Mining power didn't reduce in BRH2012.": 1, "> Apart from a probable temporary spike, the price should not be moved from the long-term trend. Reason is that the next halving is priced in.\n\nThat's not really possible. Mining power will always rise to within about 2% of the current price, increasing the cost of mining to 98% or so of the price of 1 bitcoin.\n\nSo if bitcoin is worth $300, then the mining cost to generate one bitcoin will rise to about $294. Or somewhere around there.\n\nDuring the BRH the cost to generate one bitcoin *doubles* overnight. Miners will still generally keep mining, but they won't sell because they'd be selling at a loss. For your scenario to remain true half of all mining power would have to shut down, halving the cost of mining, and I don't see that happening. Didn't happen last time.\n\nInstead miners tend to buy when the price of bitcoin is under their generation cost, since they know that means all miners will not be selling. This happened last in BRH2012. \n\nMaybe, some miners will shut down, but I wouldn't expect it to be more than 20%, and I'd expect power-miner companies to quickly take up that slack in expectation.\n\n> You can look at Namecoin, which had a halving 2 weeks ago for an indication as to how the price will behave.\n\nNamecoin isn't bitcoin though, somehow I doubt we can take them as a comparator.

All she has to do is mix together the publicly exchanged colors:\n\nAlice sends yellow and yellow+blue, receives yellow+red, mixes blue and yellow+red and obtains blue+yellow+red, which is the key.\n\nBob sends yellow and yellow+red, receives yellow+blue, mixes red and yellow+blue and obtains red+yellow+blue, which is the key.\n\nEve sees yellow, yellow+blue and yellow+red being sent in the clear, mixes them together and gets yellow+blue+yellow+red, which (in the color universe) is the same as yellow+blue+red, which is the key.\n\nThis doesn't work in mathematics, because the equivalent of yellow+blue+yellow+red and yellow+blue+red are two different things. But a person who doesn't know the mathematics behind Diffie-Hellman is left bewildered by your stupid color analogy regarding how the hell is this thing supposed to work!": 2, "This is longer than I thought it would be, but I'll post it anyway:\n\n**Elliptic Curve Cryptography**\n\nIf Alice and Bob want to use ECC, first they need to agree on an elliptic curve to use. There are many curves to choose from, and each one is defined by several parameters. The one we'll mention in particular is the generator point (G). The generator point is a point on the chosen curve whose most important property is that everybody agrees to use the same one.\n\nAlice needs a private key (a), which is just a 256 bit random number. She also needs a public key (A), which she calculates by multiplying her private key by the generator point (A=aG)\n\nBob calculates his keypair in the same way (b, B=bG)\n\nAlice can use her private key and a message to generate a signature. If Bob sees the signature attached to a message, and if Bob has Alice's public key, Bob can prove that the signature came from Alice's private key. Alice can do the same for signatures generated by Bob.\n\nThe security of ECC comes from the property that multiplication is easy, but division is so hard that it's considered impossible.\n\nEven though the actual process for performing addition and multiplication on EC points is complicated, a nice feature of EC math is that you don't need to worry about how it actually happens - most of the time all you need to know is that addition and multiplication on EC points behaves like addition and multiplication of numbers.\n\n**Elliptic Curve Diffie Hellman**\n\nAlice wants to send some Bitcoins to Bob. For that, she needs an address. Bob does not want to explicitly give Alice an address - he wants to publish a public key that anyone can use to generate an address from, but he doesn't want everybody to generate the same address. How is this possible?\n\nAlice needs a shared secret with Bob. To create one, she multiplies her private key by Bob's public key:\n\nS = aB\n\nThis doesn't look immediately useful until we consider how Bob would calculate the shared secret. He multiplies his private key by Alice's public key.\n\nS = bA\n\nAre these really the same? Remember that public keys are private keys multiplied by a generator point:\n\nS = aB = a(bG)\n\nS = bA = b(aG)\n\nS = abG = baG\n\nAny two individuals who know each other's public key can, with simple multiplication, can calculate a shared secret that nobody else can either duplicate or link to either party's public keys. That's ECDH.\n\nAlice and Bob can turn their shared secret (which is a curve point) into a number using a hash function. We'll call the number representation of the shared secret (s).\n\nIn what way is the shared secret useful for Alice's problem?\n\nShe needs to calculate a new public key for which Bob can calculate the private key, but which nobody else can connect either to Alice's or to Bob's public keys.\n\nAlice creates a new public key for Bob by adding the shared secret to Bob's public key:\n\nC = B + sG\n\nHow do we know that Bob has the private key (c) for this new public key?\n\nC = B + sG = bG + sG\n\nC = (b+s)G\n\nc = b + s\n\nPerfect. To spend bitcoins sent to the address for C, all Bob needs to know is Alice's public key. Then he can calculate the shared secret, and add that shared secret to his private key.\n\nAlice can't calculate c, because she doesn't know Bob's private key.\n\nNo outside observers can connect C to either Alice or Bob, because they can't calculate the shared secret.": 8, 'Think of a normal transaction. Instead of sending to the address the person publicizes you send to a computed address using the information they publicize. \n\nThe computed address uses "stuff" you generate too. So each person is unique. You publish that "stuff" in the txOut metadata for the stealth transaction. The person uses their stealth address, well one of the stealth keys, and that metadata "stuff" (ephemKey) to generate an address. \n\nThe address the payer/payee generate are the same. The payee cannot create it until they get the payer\'s ephemKey (metadata). The payer cannot create it until they get the payee\'s stealth key.\n\nThe Payer broadcasts the transaction. The Payee can only find the transaction by searching for the computed address as the recipient for every transaction. If a match is found the software can pull the private key out of the meta data in WIF format and import it to a wallet, and spend it later.\n\nThe Tx is still public.
