In other words, it could be designed to keep blocks a size that targets a certain average fee. If average fee exceeds the target (determined beforehand and extrapolated forward to properly address the miner incentive issue -- maybe retarget the average fee to a higher level every halving), then block limit can be increased to reduce fee pressure and hence average fee... and vice versa.

Perhaps, if the transaction fees are raised, the traffic will drop substantially, and then raising the block size limit becomes less urgent. \n\n>  And miners needs to stop being selfish, greedy twerps? I hope it works.\n\nOn the contrary: if the minimum fee was sufficiently high, so that the total fee per block might be 1000$ instead of 25$,   their selfish interest should induce them to try to fill their blocks, even at the cost of losing a few seconds in the race. ": 1, "Why's that a bad thing?": 1, 'Yes, unfortunately.': 1, 'According to [this plot](https://bitcoinfees.github.io/#3h) the transaction rate reached ~2.55 MB every 10 minutes (1 decaminute) before the plot server crashed.  That is ~ 10 tx/s or ~1 million tx/day, although that rate was sustained only for a few hours at most.\n\nAccording to some other post, because of miners often mining empty or incomplete blocks, the actual capacity of the network is only ~50% of its maximum capacity; that is, ~180\'000 instead of 360\'000 tx/day.  Before the attack, the "normal" traffic was ~120\'000 tx/day.  Therefore, a spammer needs to generate only 60\'000 tx/day to completely fill the network and start a backlog of unconfirmed transactions in the queues.  If the average tx fee is 0.01 USD, such an attach would cost 600 USD/day (25 USD/h).\n\nTraffic increased almost linearly from 60\'000 to 120\'000 tx/day in the last 12 months.  At this rate, if nothing else changes, it would reach 150\'000 tx/day in 6 months.  While still below the 180\'000 effective capacity, at that point there should be recurrent "traffic jams" during peak hours.  Traffic will probably stabilize at that level as users get sick of waiting (or of hearing bullshit about the "fee market") and give up on bitcoin.\n\nIf the block size limit were increased to 8 MB, the daily traffic would of course not increase immediately.  If the effective max capacity remained the same (that is, miners continued to mine only 500 kB blocks on average, even with backlogs), then the change would have neither good nor bad effects, and the risk of spam attacks will be the same.  \n\nLet\'s then  assume that the effective capacity will be still ~50% of the theoretical maximum: that is, 4 MB average block size with full queues, or 10\'000 max tx/block, 16 tx/s, ~1.44 million tx/day.  If traffic keeps growing at 60\'000 tx/day per year, it would take 17 years to reach 80% of the effective capacity (~1.2 M tx/day).  So, even if traffic were to grow exponentially, 8 MB should be OK for at least a couple of years.    \n\nIn that scenario, at current traffic levels, a spam attack would have to geenrate more than 55\'000 tx per hour, or more than 15 tx/s, in order to saturate the network and start a backlog.  At 0.01 USD/tx, that would cost the attacker 550 USD/hour.\n\nIn conclusion, increasing the block size to 8 MB, by itself, would probably solve the congestion problem for a couple of years at least, and make a spam attack 20 times more expensive.  \n\nIn order to make spam attacks even more unlikely, it would be prudent to raise the minimum fee to a significative leel.  Say, require 0.05 USD per output, independently of its amount.  That, and a 8 MB block size limit, would raise the cost of a spam attack to 2500 USD/hour or more.  \n\nA fee increase would also eliminate much of the spam and frivolous traffic in the blockchain.  That would actually decrease the normal load on the relay nodes (whereas limiting the blocks to 1 MB would not prevent it from increasing).\n\nA substantial fee increase would also be an incentive for miners to maximize the size of their bocks.  If the average fee is 0.05 USD per transaction, a 4 MB block will pay ~500 USD, whereas a full 8 MB block would pay 1000 USD -- quite a difference, compared to the block reward (~3500 USD).': 2, 'Lately, before the spam attack, the block reward was ~6700 USD, and the average fee per transaction was ~3.3 US cents.  The total fees for a full 1 MB block would be ~85 USD, which is ~1.2% of the reward.  So, if an empty block has 2% more chance to win the PoW race than a full block, mining empty blocks will be more profitable to the miner. \n\nIf the minimum transaction fee were raised to 0.10 USD, for example, the total fee for a full 1 MB block would be ~250 USD (instead of ~85 USD), that is, ~3.7% of the block reward.  Then mining empty blocks would be more profitable only if they had 4% more chance to win than a full block. ': 1, "You're awesome with math.  I'm not, so I'll trust your numbers.

For the rest they have to wait for hours on end, see their transaction drop off completely, try a higher fee and perhaps be outbid, basically the network becomes highly inconvenient to use for the fast majority which makes it pretty much broken hence why Satoshi - the person who created this whole thing - suggested that the blocksize be increased.

Posted Oct 25, 2014 by Jon Evans (@rezendi), Columnist\n\n\n\nStrange, interesting, and wildly ambitious things are afoot in the world of Bitcoin and blockchains. I give you Zerocash, a completely anonymous currency; Ethereum, a blockchain platform designed to decentralize much of the Internet; and sidechains, a proposal to accelerate the evolution of Bitcoin itself. Any one of these could conceivably become a very big deal. All three? Prick up your ears.\nOf Bitcoins And Blockchains\n\nIf you\xe2\x80\x99re not au fait with blockchains, your head may already be swimming. Some background: Bitcoin, the infamous cryptocurrency, is built on a new kind of distributed-consensus technology called a blockchain, which allows transactions to be securely stored and verified without any centralized authority at all, because (to oversimplify) they are validated by the entire network.\n\nIts success has spawned scores of variant cryptocurrencies, known as \xe2\x80\x9caltcoins,\xe2\x80\x9d the most famous of which is Dogecoin. But Bitcoin remains, by far, the big dog.\n\nIf you control more than half of the computations that power any cryptocurrency, then you can spend the same money more than once: a \xe2\x80\x9c51% attack.\xe2\x80\x9d Altcoins are especially vulnerable. But the stunning amount of computing power being poured into the Bitcoin network renders it (probably) effectively immune to such an attack, as per this mindboggling graph from blockchain.info\xe2\x80\x93\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Bitcoin mining network is currently performing some three hundred quadrillion hash computations per second to secure and verify Bitcoin transactions. (If you think that\xe2\x80\x99s environmentally wasteful, compare it to gold mining.) Meanwhile, despite its much-publicized decline of late, Bitcoin still has a collective market capitalization of nearly $5 billion, twice what it was a year ago.\n\n\nWhy You Should Care\n\nBitcoin is only mildly interesting as a store of value; there are many good alternatives. It\xe2\x80\x99s more interesting as a means to transfer money to anywhere and anyone, with greater speed and lower transaction fees than most alternatives, with no ID requirements.\n\nBut it\xe2\x80\x99s really interesting because it\xe2\x80\x99s the world\xe2\x80\x99s first form of programmable money.\n\nMany people don\xe2\x80\x99t appreciate that Bitcoin supports a simple scripting language which can orchestrate transactions. (In fact all transactions actually run as scripts.) This language already supports cases such as: deposits that automatically revert after a period of time, escrow transactions, transactions which rely on some external condition (albeit in a complex way that requires a third-party \xe2\x80\x9coracle\xe2\x80\x9d), and more.\n\nWhat are all of the potential applications of fully programmable money? Especially if the capabilities of that scripting language are expanded? I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, and neither do you. It\xe2\x80\x99s the proverbial whole new ball game.\n\nBut progress is tricky. Bitcoin is the only cryptocurrency powered and secured by a truly gargantuan mining network, but because it\xe2\x80\x99s worth so much, and its network is so widespread, changes to Bitcoin itself are necessarily promulgated very slowly, and experimentation is done with extreme tentative caution. So we can try out new kinds of blockchains and cryptocurrencies (like Ethereum and Zerocash), or we can rely on the value, scarcity and (technical) stability of Bitcoin, but we can\xe2\x80\x99t do both. Right?\n\n\xe2\x80\xa6Wrong, says Adam Back.\n\n\nSidechains: Back, Hill, and Blockstream\n\nThe \xe2\x80\x9cthree hundred quadrillion hashes\xe2\x80\x9d mentioned up above refer to attempts to satisfy the Hashcash proof-of-work function that Adam Back invented way back in 1997, used today to verify Bitcoin transactions. Now Back is back with a new proposal: sidechains, which would allow Bitcoins (and other blockchain assets) to be transferred between blockchains.\n\n**Back and co. are not acting purely out of technical benevolence.** He and a group of co-founders, including several core Bitcoin developers, headed by former Zero-Knowledge Systems CEO Austin Hill, have a launched a startup called Blockstream. According to Coindesk, they have already raised $15 million in an ongoing funding round, and added Reid Hoffman to their board. Their exact business remains mysterious, but is built around sidechains. (The sidechain code itself will apparently be open-source. See Blockstream\xe2\x80\x99s recent Reddit AMA.)\n\nTo quote the sidechains white paper (PDF):\n\n[deleted to save space]\n\nBlockstream has many other influential fans, including Vinod Khosla and Gavin Andresen, chief scientist of the Bitcoin Foundation (who also recently did an AMA):\n\n\n\nThere are critics, although the most visible, from Peter Todd, still stresses that \xe2\x80\x9c90% of the ideas in sidechains are good ideas.\xe2\x80\x9d His chief complaint is that either sidechains will still be vulnerable to 51% attacks, or Bitcoin miners will become more centralized, more powerful, and more dangerous. (There is also some rather more histrionic criticism.)\n\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s worth noting that while one form of sidechain \xe2\x80\x94 a so-called \xe2\x80\x9cfederated peg\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 can be created today, for sidechains which require no external trust beyond the blockchain, some form of change to the core Bitcoin protocol will be required. At this point, though, such a change seems (to me) an inevitability.\n\n\n\nEthereum and Zerocash\n\nSidechains are far from the only \xe2\x80\x9cBitcoin 2.0\xe2\x80\xb3 project, although they do have the unusual feature that, as far as I know, all other such projects could be built atop sidechains. The two which interest me most are Ethereum and Zerocash. (And not just me: to quote Back in the AMA, \xe2\x80\x9ci\xe2\x80\x99m waiting for the zerocash sidechain :)\xe2\x80\x9c.)\n\nBitcoin is not anonymous. Every transaction\xe2\x80\x99s sender, receiver, and amount are recorded in the blockchain\xe2\x80\x99s public record. The \xe2\x80\x9csender\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9creceiver\xe2\x80\x9d are Bitcoin addresses, not names, but if anyone connects your identity to an address, its entire Bitcoin history will be apparent to everyone. (There are workarounds, but they\xe2\x80\x99re flawed.) Zerocash, authored by a group of cryptographic academics, is a blockchain protocol wherein senders, receivers, and amounts are all kept entirely anonymous. In a world where privacy is withering away like ice in summer, a little more anonymity would be a welcome development.\n\nEthereum is another separate project scheduled to launch its \xe2\x80\x9cgenesis block\xe2\x80\x9d this winter. You have to admire its creators\xe2\x80\x99 ambition: its blockchain supports a full Turing-compete programming language intended to power not just programmable money but also financial derivatives, voting systems, identity registries, reputation systems, decentralized file storage, decentralized autonomous operations(!), and more. They recently raised 30,000 bitcoins, or some $14 million at current prices, by selling their own currency, \xe2\x80\x9cether,\xe2\x80\x9d and its blockchain\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cgenesis block\xe2\x80\x9d is due to launch this winter.\n\nEthereum already supports sidechains, too, out of the box. But also\xe2\x80\x93you could take a Bitcoin sidechain and clone Ethereum on it! Sorry if this all hurts your head.\n\n\n\nWarnings and Conclusions\n\nIf you\xe2\x80\x99re thinking: wait, the Ethereum people sold their own made-up digital currency for someone else\xe2\x80\x99s made-up digital currency, which will now be pegged against more new made-up currencies? And people trade cold hard US dollars for these? This is snake-oil nonsense! let me assure you: it\xe2\x80\x99s possible that you may ultimately be proved right. But I don\xe2\x80\x99t think so. Blockchains, and the new monetary applications that blockchains make possible, seem to me to be a sufficiently powerful and interesting innovation that cryptocurrencies\xe2\x80\x93as a class\xe2\x80\x93do in fact have inherent value, not least because you can do things with them that you can\xe2\x80\x99t with traditional fiat currency.\n\nThis is highly anecdotal, but at a Blockstream event this week, I spoke to multiple people working at startups with transaction-based business models, whose companies are already up and running using traditional currency \xe2\x80\xa6 who are now beginning to move towards Bitcoin\xe2\x80\x99s blockchain as a substrate for their transactions. Not because they\xe2\x80\x99re True Bitcoin Believers, but because it just makes practical and technical sense. I strongly suspect that the number of such people will begin to grow rather large as we move through the next iterations of blockchain technology.\n\n-- \nDavid Vincenzetti \nCEO\n\nHacking Team\nMilan Singapore Washington DC\nwww.hackingteam.com\n': 9, '> We can try to prepare ourselves for when that day comes, but there\'s no "law" that will stop it.\n\nOr, you know, you will just get arrested for possession.': 1, 'oh :) derp, I guess I missed the transition from quotes to commentary...\n': 1, "I've heard nasty shit happen on there.
