Is that a fair representation of your viewpoint?\n\nWell, there are a number of arguments I can think of:\n\n* New Bitcoins can only be created on the main chain all the way until 2140. Side chains are limited to transaction fees. You mentioned that in your top post, so any potential move by miners to a side chain is probably going to be gradual.\n* Miners trying to block people from moving Bitcoins onto the side chain would be working against their own best interest (less transaction fees to mine), so I wouldn't worry about that part.\n* The mining algorithm on the side chain could be different, requiring different hardware. If mining difficulty levels off, then this argument becomes more important since ROI's will be calculated over longer periods of time.\n* Bitcoin is the main chain. All side chains hanging off it can only move back and forth between each other through the main chain. It still has a very valuable function in this scenario. It's The One that Binds Them. :)\n\n\n\nAnother argument is; side chains that become more popular than the bitcoin blockchain apparently offer better functionality / value / whatever.

Let's say someone makes an Ethereum side chain that only uses Bitcoin instead of Ether as its coin. It would take some time to harden the Ethereum codebase, but let's assume that it's rock solid. Ethereum offers a lot more functionality than the bitcoin protocol, so I'd personally have no problem with it if that chain became more popular than the bitcoin main chain, to the point that bitcoin could even die off completely. Everyone can move over with the click of a button. No pre mining, no coin auction, just a peg from Bitcoin to the new Side-Ethereum. The main bitcoin chain would probably stay alive for quite some time, since the economic incentive of the miners is the remaining bitcoins and the potential funds that still want to move to the Ethereum side chain.

After 10 minutes, they create a transaction to timestamp it into Bitcoin.\n\n2) Bloat - What would happen if Patrick Byrne got his way and all Wall Street transactions resolved to the Bitcoin blockchain.  There isn\xe2\x80\x99t enough space to handle all those transactions as Counterparty stands today.  If we threw open the blocksize limit, and totally gave up on decentralization, then we might be able to do it, but at the cost of losing what makes bitcoin special.  \n\n\n\nI re-read BIP70 and I do not see how the payment protocol will substitute for block confirmations.  Even in BIP70, there is the line: \xe2\x80\x9c\xef\xbb\xbfMerchant's server detects payment and after sufficient transaction confirmations considers the transaction final.\xe2\x80\x9d  \n\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0070.mediawiki\n\nI suppose that having a signed address from the merchant would give the sender more confidence that they are sending to the correct merchant, but that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t solve a doublespend from the merchant\xe2\x80\x99s perspective.  Even if a new BIP did somehow allow for instant confirmations the bloat problem would still be there.  \n\nThis brings into question the nature of finality, and what it would take to reverse a decision.  Factom gives more granularity to finality.  \n\nIn Bitcoin, there is much talk about the number of confirmations.  The more confirmations, the more final a transaction is.  There is a gap between 0 and 1 confirmations, though.  Polling the network to see if there are conflicting transactions is how most systems solving this gap work today.  Even that, though, is fragile, since miners can include whatever transactions they want (See BitUndo) http://www.bitundo.com/\n\nFactom fills that gap.  There are multiple rising levels of confidence Factom would give.\n\n0-10 seconds: Transaction is broadcast and acknowledged by the appropriate Federated server.\n\n0-1 minutes: Transaction is signed by the majority of Federated servers\n\n0-10 minutes: Transactions over the past 10 minutes are signed by majority of Federated servers, and an OP_RETURN transaction is created and submitted to Bitcoin.\n\n0 - ~20 minutes: A Bitcon miner mines the OP_RETURN message, making Factom unable to modify the contents of the blocks.\n\n~20 - ~60 minutes the OP_RETURN transaction is buried under 6 confirmations in Bitcoin.\n\n\nDepending on the risk tolerance for the individual transaction, they would wait anywhere from 0 to 60 minutes.  Same as with Bitcoin, but with more granularity before the first confirmation.\n\nedit: formatting": 1, "When you post on Facebook, cloud services, etc. you don't really own your data and you're subject to their crazy centralized security problems. \n\nIn a Factom world, your data could really be locked down and private with private keys and you in total control.

Imagine a world where everyone can vote (only once) from whatever device they choose (feature phone, public library terminal, iPad). And imagine if they could vote in a truly private way without intimidation at the polls or the fear of repercussions after the election. Imagine if voting could be truly audited and refined every election cycle to make it more secure and user friendly.\n\nOnce you have secure voting, then you could start thinking about transparent and honest governing systems where every dollar could be tracked, audited and tied to the decision makers responsible. No more back-door agreements. No more hidden agendas. Factom could force these systems to be honest.\n\nAlso, a huge amount of mischief happens around the world when corrupt governments monkey with property title records (which remember, is where the majority of the world\'s wealth is held).

The track record of such projects is abysmal. So again, I ask why get investment in this way instead of, say raising money from VCs or bootstrapping?\n\nGreat point.  We will have a working protocol before distributing the tokens.\n\n> As far as making money from an open source app, I can think of a lot of ways to make a profit off of something like this. Professional services, consulting, maintenance contracts, etc.\n\nAbsolutely agree that if you have a running protocol (like Bitcoin) you have all these opportunities.  But the protocol itself requires incentives to insure that people are willing to work to keep the system up, and have some way to profit.  Mining companies, mining pools, merchant services, exchanges, and more all exist directly or indirectly because of mining rewards and transaction fees.\n\nOur protocol is no different.\n\n> You can charge bitcoin to do that, though.\n\nBitcoin has to be sent somewhere.  Who gets it?  How does the person paying know who is supposed to get it?  And if every entry in Factom requires a Bitcoin transaction (280 bytes or larger) how is Factom reducing bloat?\n\nWhen you pay a transaction fee in Bitcoin, you do not specify who gets it.  But the miner who ultimately mines the block (not necessarily the first miner who mines a block) gets that fee.  How do I do that with Bitcoin for my system?  If I want a system that distributes funds through the protocol without the user specifying the recipient, I can\'t do that with Bitcoin.\n\n>> We wanted a system that allowed users to avoid any cryptocurrency.\n\n> I\'m not sure what this even means. Isn\'t Factoid a cryptocurrency? Or are you defining cryptocurrency in some different way than "scarce digital medium of exchange"?\n\nTo put an entry into Factom, you take a Factoid and convert it to Entry Credits tied to a public address.  The ECs are nontransferable, and can only be used to put entries into Factom.  \n\nSo a Factom user can use money to buy Entry Credits from someone that has Factoids (our token).  Someone like the Federated Servers who are being paid Factom Tokens by the protocol.\n\nNow the Factom user can use their ECs to build chains and place entries.  Reading the data is free.  They are done, and they never had a wallet, and they never had to have a cryptocurrency.  They could have paid with a Credit Card after all.  And Entry Credits are not cryptocurrencies, because you can\'t exchange them.\n\n>> If every entry in Factom required a Bitcoin Payment, then just paying for entries in Factom would bloat the blockchain almost as much as just putting the data into the blockchain itself.\n\n> You can also do what a lot of sites do and have accounts for each user and withdraw bitcoins on account as the user spends them. Also, obtaining Factoids will presumably require you to spend bitcoins to get and that too, will bloat the blockchain.\n\nYou absolutely could have an account.  But if you have a distributed protocol, who holds the account?  How can one server sell the right to put an entry credit into Factom and obligate another to spend time and energy to make good?\n\nFurthermore, what gives the Factom Servers the right to sell entries?  Anyone could sell entries if they wanted to, unless there was some way to distribute the right to sell entries.  Someway we could measure their contribution to the system that they could in turn use to show they had the right to sell the entry.\n\nSomething like a token.\n\n': 4, "Information posted in Factom is distributed via Entries.

The consensus mechanism is still being developed, but this is what we are thinking right now.  We envisage at least 32 full node servers.  16 of the servers (Federated servers) will be key to the consensus forming mechanism.  They will cooperate together to package the data into the Factom system.  There will be 16 additional servers (Audit servers) which have user votes assigned to them, but fewer than the Federated servers.  The Audit servers have an incentive to publicize misdeeds by the Federated servers.  If users are unhappy with a specific Federated server, they will withdraw their voting support.  If enough support is withdrawn, then the misbehaving server will be demoted down to an Audit server or below and the highest ranking Audit server will rise to the rank of Federated server.\n\nHopefully this is enough incentive for each of the systems to keep each other honest.  What do you think?\n': 1, 'In the appendix of the white-paper there is a section about "Audit Applications". Check out the first one related to "Log Analysis". It is something that many Bitcoin exchanges could start doing immediately. In fact, any *payments start-up* could start using Factom as a way to *record* the api logs between them and their customers. This way, if a dispute ever arises, they can point to the immutable record existing in the Blockchain. Customers can get the same protection in the case of fraud by the payment provider, Bitcoin exchange, etc.': 3, 'Bow ties!': 3, "Bingo!\n\nYou wouldn't have to rely on Bank of America's shaky record keeping as a way of proving your home belonged to you. In a Factom world, your title would be yours!": 3, 'What do you see as the first use-case of the Factom technology, in terms of third party adoption?': 2, "hmm, there are two points in the Factom system.  There is the time before being included in the blockchain and the time afterwards.  This distinction would be similar to having the Bitcoin blockchain itself vs having miners continue mining.\n\nLets address the time after Factom is recorded in the blockchain.  All the data structures are stored in a P2P Distributed Hash Table (DHT).  Individuals can opt to join the DHT and share as much or as little of the full data set they want.  We are expecting that users will highly share data subsets that are personally relevant to themselves.  Also, proofs are possible with only a small segment of data, which can easily be stored locally.  \n\nThe DHT will survive even if all the Factom servers go down.  Historical data will persevere online if peers continue to share it.  \n\nDHTs are public structures though, so users sharing contraband data will be advertising that fact.  If a determined world government wanted to stop a specific BitTorrent file from being shared, they could probably do it.\n\n\nThe second part of the question would be if the servers can survive a determined attack.  That is a trickier question.  The block building network is similar to Bitcoin's, being a flood fill network.  This can tend to obfuscate where the servers are.  Also, being a proof of stake system, large mining farms will not be target-able, because they don't exist.  The Factom server personalities can have multiple locations all over the globe which exercise their authority sporadically, making it harder to find them.  Also, if one server does get shut down, the same personality can pop up another one immediately somewhere else in the world.\n\n\nA determined whole-world evil government will just turn off the internet, or have ISPs cut off anyone connecting to the networks, so no Factom cannot survive that.  However, if Factom were serving some useful function to the economy, the heavy handed approach would have political blowback.  It depends on what you mean by determined.\n\nEdit:  Maidsafe and StorJ have potential to store Factom data as well.  Those technologies are coming later though.": 1, "Factom actually keeps the information off blockchain, using its own structures, and distributes them over the systems running Factom nodes.  It is a separate P2P network, much like Bitcoin's.\n\nAll the entries we receive over 10 minutes are combined via a Merkle Tree to place the single hash (the Merkle root) into the blockchain.  In that way we reduce bloat.\n\nUsers put their entries into their own chains.  They create them, define the rules for their chains, and populate them.  Chains all have their own proofs that drive to the Bitcoin Blockchain.  If you have your chain and your data, you don't need anyone else's data.  So effectively, there is no limit on the entries we can process, but at the same time other users don't get bogged down in your data.": 7, 'You bring up a good point.  We are kind of surprised a project like this hadn\'t been started earlier.  The combination of a DHT with OP_RETURN messages is one of the primary goals of Factom.  See this news article from back in March of this year:\n\nhttp://www.coindesk.com/developers-battle-bitcoin-block-chain/\n\nMike Hearn was advocating a DHT secured by Bitcoin in this article.\n\nIdeas are easy, the hard part is implementation ...something about 99% perspiration.\n\nAfter thinking about mechanisms to collect and package arbitrary entries, we realized it would quickly turn into giant morass of unsearchable data.  The users would be able to keep Merkle proofs of data they saved, but finding it later would require scanning the entire dataset, plus knowing what to look for would also be a problem.\n\nFactom adds an user specified sorting mechanism, and combines it with a hierarchy, so that users can later find the data they secured.  The hierarchy also allows users to limit the total amount of data they need to download to do searches.\n\nThis would be all fine and dandy to do as a weekend project, but there are a few problems which would still exist.  \n\n\n-There needed to be some way of rate limiting data being entered into the DHT to prevent spam.  Charging fees are an effective way of limiting spam.  \n\n-Someone needs to pay for the BTC fees to get data into the blockchain.  Users paying servers with BTC transactions to avoid BTC transactions doesn\'t make sense.\n\n-A centralized solution would cause a censorship point, so there would need to be some kind of distributed system, which Factom is implementing.\n\n-Once you have a distributed system, you would need to have some enforcement of consensus.  In Bitcoin, the BTC generated by miners going against consensus would not be valuable, so it keeps them flowing with the main consensus.  Factom would have a similar system.  Similarly, the Federated servers need to maintain consensus in order to sell their Factoid tokens.\n\n\nFactom is implementing a sort of Proof of Stake for steering consensus.  Pure PoS suffers from "Stake Grinding" problems that allow rewriting of history.  https://download.wpsoftware.net/bitcoin/pos.pdf  Factom eliminates the Stake Grinding problem by using Bitcoin to make history unchangeable.  We can build a system using PoS, where the active users decide who runs system is run instead of miners.\n\nedit: formatting, details': 3, "The most important thing you can do as a normal consumer is start demanding accountability from your institutions.\n\nFactom creates permanent records that can't be changed later.

Sidechains and Factom are trying to achieve similar end goals, but by orthogonally different mechanisms.  Both projects are trying to increase the scalability of Bitcoin by reducing transaction volume of the Bitcoin blockchain.  Sidechains moves BTC value off the blockchain, and allows people to trade value without incurring additional transactions in the Bitcoin blockchain.  \n\nFactom is moving non-BTC denominated transactions off the Bitcoin blockchain.  Applications which need the irreversibility of Bitcoin but don't need to deal with BTC value transfer are perfect for Factom.  \n\nPegged sidechains implement a feature called atomic swaps.  When the technology is ready, Factom would like to have its internal token on a BTC-Factoid sidechain.  This would allow distributed instant swaps between the two value pools.\n": 3, "If we just wanted to create Merkle proofs of the data, then yes, doing it yourself or using assorted services would be much easier.  \n\nWe wanted to go an extra step beyond that though.  We are defining bounded shared search spaces to locate transactions after the fact.\n\nBitcoin is a complex mechanism to create a bounded shared search space for BTC transactions which is simultaneously spam and censorship resistant.  These last two points are at complete odds with each other.  Since we are also trying to make a bounded shared search space, we need a complex mechanism to balance spam and censorship.\n\nIf the shared search space were maintained by a single party, like you are suggesting, that party would have censorship powers over the data it is collecting.  The censored party could put their data in a separate system which isn't censoring.  Now 3rd parties would need to now know to look in the 2nd system for valid transactions.\n\nThis would be analogous to looking in dogeparty for your counterparty assets.  If not all counterparty wallets respected cross chain transactions, the whole system would fork.  Would the entire counterparty community take the risk of doublespends in dogeparty just because someone was being censored in the Bitcoin search space?\n\nWe are using a system similar to blind commitments (https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=206303.0) to make censorship by the system provable.\n\nAs far as the fees and a half-penny, go, though, that is probably a short term figure.

Though "conflicts" is not really the right word, considering there: Nothing I do has any obligation to help the counterparty folks except to the extent that the Bitcoin system should provide a neutral platform for the exchange of the Bitcoin currency, and sometimes achieving that requires ignoring competing or even overtly hostile uses of the system, because the judgment calls (and the possibility of making them) is a path fraught with peril.\n\nI have to assume that you also mean competitors of Bitcoin when you say "those competitors" ... since the non-reliance-on-Bitcoin-Core\'s-behavior was advice you were giving long before Blockstream existed. ... and you\'re right to give that advice: the Bitcoin ecosystem as a whole (much less the maintainers of any particular implementation) have no obligation to support the needs of competing systems; and might decide to outright block them in the future.  That wouldn\'t be my decision, I\'d consider that too risky for idealogical reasons,  but if the community of Bitcoin currency users saw displacement, they might do so in spite of my calls for caution.\n\nOn the technical front, I\'ve long been concerned about systems which embed non-bitcoin data in the Blockchain creating harm for the users of the Bitcoin currency, both from a scalability and a liability perspective. I believe our first conversation was about that subject, in fact. At times, you\'ve even shared some of these concerns. I\'ve made specific technical proposals on how systems like Bitcoin can minimize non-transaction data (e.g. p2psh^2 http://sourceforge.net/p/bitcoin/mailman/message/30705609/ as an example).\n\nSo... as you point out in that post I linked to: Concern about the harm to concurrency from a proliferation of competing systems, concerns about blockchain scalability vs decentralization, concerns about the reliance on worst-security-possible centralized infrastructure, concerns about being able to heavily fund infrastructure work. etc.. are what motivated the creation of Blockstream.

Follow me to **[collect it](https://www.changetip.com/collect/133538).**\n\n[ChangeTip info](https://www.changetip.com/tip-online/reddit) | [ChangeTip video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AnfKpypMNw) | /r/Bitcoin': 1, "If you choose to accept bitcoin the costs for you to implement it as a payment option are virtually nil. i'm sure your employee would be able to help too.\n\n**Firstly**\nIt is likely that you wouldn't get many (if any) customers paying with bitcoin. Bitcoin is currently in a stage where it requires further evangelism from those who believe in it's worth as a technology and a currency. On the other side of this, you may obtain new business from bitcoin users simply for making it available as a method of payment. Ultimately if you choose not to accept bitcoin, you will never have a customer pay with it. If you wanted to gauge it's viability (and let people know you may accept it) you could create posts on local forums asking the people in your area whether they would be ok with using it for your specific service, /r/brighton for example.\n\n**Secondly**\nBitcoin is a digital currency based upon a technology known as the blockchain. You could suggest that the blockchain is like a payment processor, which is not entirely accurate but helps simplify the explanation and allows new users to better relate. The hardest part of this process I believe is getting the users to first buy bitcoin to then pay you with them. To somebody new this could appear to be a little hassle.\n\nTo pay with bitcoin both you and the customer need a wallet. You can use a third party hosted wallet get one on blockchain.info or coinbase.com or you can download the software to run a wallet on your computer. There are risks associated with both of these methods that you should look into. Specifically, with a hosted solution they could lose your coins, get hacked or just vanish without a trace. If use a software wallet you should look into either exchanging the bitcoin into fiat straightaway or storing the bitcoins on an offline computer using a method known as cold storage.\n\nOnce the customer has a wallet they need to obtain some bitcoins to fill it with. This process can be comparable to adding money to a paypal account. To obtain bitcoins they need to visit an exchange and buy some with fiat. bittylicious.com, coinbase.com or some other user recommended option can help there.\n\nUpon buying their coins and having them in their wallet, they need to make the payment to you. This is done by creating a payment, entering the amount (in bitcoins), the address to send them to (your wallets address) and clicking send. A transaction can be accepted almost immediately, however, the transaction will not be verified until the next bitcoin block has been mined - on average this takes about 10 minutes. For more information on this see: https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Double-spending\n\nThere are mobile apps available to make the transaction as quick and easy as possible. I can't offer much help with those though.\n\n\n**Thirdly**\nYou will need to get some professional advice to be sure. Legislation is quite sparse and very likely to change, it's a space you would have to watch if you were accepting bitcoin. As far as I am aware bitcoin is currently considered as an asset by the UK. It could be worth reading the following: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/revenue-and-customs-brief-9-2014-bitcoin-and-other-cryptocurrencies/revenue-and-customs-brief-9-2014-bitcoin-and-other-cryptocurrencies": 0, "Hi Jeff,\n\nI can't say how likely it is to take off, this is not a good place to ask that question simply because most of us are very likely to believe it will succeed, by virtue of being here. Many of us have some savings in bitcoin based on that belief, I have a small amount, so we are betting on its success. I personally believe it is close to inevitable, but may take many years.\n\nTo your second question, you might get some free PR by posting on here, or maybe a local newspaper. If you get the word out that you accept bitcoin, people who use it will remember, and you may become their first choice. A sign saying that you accept bitcoin would be a must.\n\nIn answer to your third question, yes. 1,000,000 bits = 1 bitcoin.

One use-case is pre-payment before you do call-out (that might be easier than training all your staff to accept it on-site anyway)\n\n> worried I may get scammed\n\nAs others have said, Bitcoin is irreversible so that's not the main risk. However, your own security is a learning curve. Two basics are 1) don't trust yourself to 'think up' strong passwords - use a password manager like lastpass or keychain on Mac to generate them for you and 2) use two-factor authentication wherever possible.

Do they get redirected by some phone service or do they google for a locksmith? Make sure it\'s visible on your website that you accept Bitcoin.

Someone who browses this map around Brighton will realize that there\'s a locksmith accepting Bitcoin before he locks himself out. ;-)\n\n> Advertising: To touch on Demotruck\'s point. Do you think that our business would be able to use accepting bitcoin to gain positive PR that could lead to extra sales, even if those sales aren\'t in bitcoin until the point that it starts to take off. If so is there any suggestions you the Reddit Bitcoin Community have to gain PR?\n\nWell, as I said, I\'m unfamiliar with your business, so I don\'t know more specific advice than what I already gave. There are still very few businesses accepting Bitcoin and people are still googling for "businesses who accept bitcoin in <area>" instead of more specific services. There is some extra exposure by using Bitcoin if managed correctly (and I don\'t know what that means in your case). However, I would expect the most extra sales being made in Bitcoin by people either knowing about or searching for a locksmith that accepts Bitcoin when they actually need one.\n\n> Terms and conditions: My main reason for the terms and conditions is non payment which I take to a small claims court (often just out of principle).\n\nAs always in such questions, I\'m not a lawyer and I don\'t know anything about UK law.\n\nThere isn\'t much a difference if a customer pays you with Bitcoin or with a foreign currency. If you send a bill in pounds and the customer doesn\'t pays, does it matter to a court wether you allowed your customer to pay in dollars? You could send out normal bills but add also add a Bitcoin address, then customers can choose how to pay. If someone doesn\'t pay you just file for a claim in pounds.\n\n> You state that no charge back is possible, could you expand on this?\n\nIf someone steals your credit card info and spends some of your balance, you can call your bank which will investigate the transaction and undo the transaction if the merchant is unable to prove its legitimacy. Quoting from [Dalpay](https://www.dalpay.com/en/support/chargebacks.html):\n\n> As you know, customers or cardholders obtain credit cards from banks, which are referred to as the "issuing bank." A chargeback (also known as a reversal) is a form of customer protection provided by the issuing banks, which allows cardholders to file a complaint regarding fraudulent transactions on their statement. Once the cardholder files a dispute, the issuing bank makes an investigation into the complaint.\nOnce the transaction is proven to be indeed fraudulent, the bank will refund the original value to the cardholder. From the merchant\'s point of view, if you do not prove the transaction to be legitimate, the bank will take back the entire value of the transaction from your account, along with an additional fee.\n\nSo if someone pays you with a stolen credit card then the transaction will be reversed since there wasn\'t a contract with the card holder. Also dishonest customers could file a complaint anyway and hope that you\'re unable to prove the legitimacy of the transaction.\n\nWith Bitcoin such tricks are absolutely impossible. If you send a transaction that gets confirmed, no bank or government in the world can reverse that transaction without destroying Bitcoin itself. That\'s why it\'s so useful in the internet.\n\n> I don\'t know how to do quotes\n\nIf you write this:\n\n\\> This is a quote.\n\nyou get this:\n\n> This is a quote.': 1, '> My main problem is I only know a few people that own bitcoin & don\'t think that anyone will actually ever pay us in bitcoins, is this a naive assumption of me?\n\nThat\'s not naive at all. However, if you don\'t put up a clear sign that you\'re willing to accept bitcoins then you most surely won\'t get any bitcoin customer. This thing needs still needs some time to get adopted and until then I will assume that "no mention of bitcoin = bitcoin is not accepted here" because asking in each and every shop isn\'t just tiring but makes you look like the ultra-geek of the neighborhood.\n\nThat being said, if you advertize it right, accepting bitcoin might push your sales significantly. Bitcoin people are aware of the problem and usually prefer bitcoin business over competitors. Take [overstock.com](http://www.coindesk.com/overstock-ceo-patrick-byrne-1-6m-bitcoin-sales/) for example: Revenue from Bitcoin transaction is already greater than from Paypal.\n\n> My second worry is that if one of my customers asks me questions about bitcoin I might not be able to answer them? I can explain how to do almost anything with a lock but I wouldn\'t be able to explain the difference between a bitcoin and paypal without sounding like I\'d been teleported here from 1920.\n\nWhy don\'t be open about that? Understanding fully how Bitcoin works exactly is a job for academics because concepts like zero-knowledge proof, hashing and public-private-key cryptography are not quite general knowledge yet but crucial in understanding why Bitcoin works the way it works. By the way, the situation isn\'t so much different for "normal money". Take it from an Economics graduate student: Most people don\'t have a clue why and how the money they hold and spend without a second thought actually works.\n\nYou actually said it: You can send money without banks & intermediaries. If that\'s enough for you to use Bitcoin, then why don\'t put it that way?\n\n> Thirdly, I\'m worried I may get scammed. My terms and conditions contain sections about payment that would cover me in a small claims court but I would not have a clue how to write a section about bitcoin payments and I don\'t think my solicitor would either.\n\nYour worry is understandable and healthy. However, the scammed business owners still have to be found. If you let customers pay with credit cards, the risks of unjustified charge-backs is always there. With Bitcoin the situation is easy: If the transaction is confirmed, no charge-back is possible. Until the transaction confirms (which takes ~10 min.), the payer may try to spend the same coins elsewhere and hope that this second transaction gets confirmed first.
