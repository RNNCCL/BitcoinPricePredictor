Demand is. And the only way to build that demand is to put our money where our mouth is and transact with it. Maybe once vendors start seeing enough Bitcoin transactions coming through, and realizing that they don\'t need to set aside funds to cover future charge backs, they\'ll see the light and start offering a slightly reduced price for their goods to Bitcoin buyers, just as gas stations provide discounts on fuel to cash paying gas purchasers versus credit card spending ones. \n\nIf we\'re convinced that this is the best currency ever,we should spend it to show vendor and customers.

Do you feel there will be a standard or a trust when it comes to P2P lending? Banks now have (at least in the US) FDIC insured accounts. This is a format that either banks can choose to adopt or not. People feel good when they know there banking is insured (even if it is by the US government "haha, power of deception right"). Anyways back to my Q, do you think there will be a universal standard or code when it comes to P2P lending or BTC banking in general when it comes to holding securities outside your own personal wallet?\n\nAnd last question.

However, if someone defaults they can pay late.\n\nHere is the strategy that I deployed.  I look at the loss potential against the ROI in aggregate and diversify based on this.  e.g. let's say loss potential is 2% and ROI is 18%.  So in theory if you were to loan to 100 people a total of 100 units, then two of those units should fail to pay... The remaining 98 units should pay 18% putting you at about 116% of original investment when notes are satisfied.  \n\nSo key is, diversify and don't dump everything into one loan unless you have other assurances.\n\nIf you need more help, I would gladly walk you through the process on hangouts.": 1, '>What reason would I have for entertaining your bet if the odds don\'t warrant doing so?\n\nThanks for continuing the conversation.

I do need to update this post, but I never stopped investing... I just kept re-investing.  So to date I do have plenty of late pays which will likely go into "arbitration" but overall I am up.  I probably could have avoided the "arbitration makers" but I mostly picked highest risk loans/borrowers after my initial "testing period".  My initial testing period was even worse.  Full of non-discrimination and just clicking any loan so I ate it on a couple there.  Today I believe I have created a list of great borrowers (all the stellar paybacks that I previously have loaned to), and whenever I see one of these "great" borrowers on my list requesting a loan I dump in some BTC. \n\nSo overall I am up, but not as much as I could have been if I hadn\'t made the "poor choice" investments, but it may have been worth it because now I have a list of really good investments/borrowers.  Some of these borrowers on my list I have already done several loans with.\n\nI will try and update this post with some stats here maybe next month.  I am in my peak busy month right now so as soon as I slow down I will update.   I will leave you with this... initially invest small enough to test (possibly to rate also) and find out who is solid and who is not.  Being late doesn\'t mean they won\'t pay back, and if they payback let you get extra fees... so late pay is not too bad, but default is and that takes a while to find out!!!': 2, "Agreed!\n\nActually there are a ton of business opportunities.  I will cover them as I can, and as my talks allow.\n\nTo be honest, I invested in loans all the way down to D- scores (would have gone lower too except I had planned on 100 loans.  I didn't discriminate on score).  When I looked at the scoring system I realized (especially based on my personal score) that the scoring mechanism will only allow for very very fortunate and social peeps to get graded the highest.  For example my score was a D+ because I have no social networks to plug in, and my bank does not allow third party logins (which I don't think any bank should).  \n\nSo instead to build my credit I will both loan and borrow and build more slowly over time.  This is actually a lot of fun too, so that helps.  I am very excited to chart the progress over time and demo all the stats in my talks.
