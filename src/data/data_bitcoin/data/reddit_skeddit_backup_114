What you can understand immediately is that the bitnet allows anyone in the world with a smart phone and Internet to use bitcoin (the currency) to transfer value around the world with minimal fees. Additionally, the bitnet supports using bitcoins in many fascinating and powerful ways. Since no single country, organization, or group controls the bitnet, it could become a globally recognized currency that would supercharge our collective financial capabilities." \n\nIn the end changing the name isn\'t necessary,  but some marketing type thinking couldn\'t hurt.

The name you suggest is what we hope btc becomes, so in that sense it is a better name IMO.\nAnd how do we get the First world to adapt to crypto?\nThat is part of my intent, we can\'t just sit at our computers and hope that BTC takes off. There is the technical and governance side and then there is marketing.\nWould people be more interested in Bitcoin if the name immediately suggested something that they already know changed their world: the internet.

Can\'t buy a TV online from America if America isn\'t half adapted.\n\nFirst world countries need first adapt their crypto and then the rest could join in.  4Billion First world users first, and then the other 3.5Bil. can jump.\n\nMaybe bitcoin can change its name not so much for what it can do, but more for how its going to do it.  Become the One World Currency Unit, or the \'GCU\' Global Currency Unit\'.  \n\nAnd how do we get the First world to adapt to crypto?\n\nWe take away their Fiat, or devalue it slowly over time.  The price of oil has dropped tremendously, hurts the job sector across the First world countries, less income, less taxes, etc.etc.etc.  Economic crash looms, and all of a sudden the crypto heaven opens up.  This is in the making as oil is not going up anytime soon.  No wonder they lifted sanctions on Iran.\n\nBut back to the New Name of BTC.

The blockchain is, I guess, [53 GB](https://blockchain.info/charts/blocks-size) and growing still. It will only get bigger as time goes on.\n\n2\\) You rarely need the entire chain. The blockchain uses a Merkle tree to store its history, which allows you to verify certain things without the whole history. \n\nThink of it like a choose your own adventure book that only has pages 1, 3, and 10 -- page 1: "if you want to fight the dragon, go to page 3, if you want to fight the wizard, page 4." There\'s still one whole adventure there to read. If someone pays you money, and you want to verify that transaction (e.g. "the wizard" in this analogy), you could potentially ask them for the precise missing pages, instead of the whole book. \n\n3\\) If there\'s a miner you trust to be honest, you don\'t need any of the chain. You can author transactions to spend your money, or create wallets to accept money, without looking at the bitcoin chain. You can send transactions to a miner and they can tell you if they think the transaction is valid. \n\nFor small amounts (e.g. a personal wallet for small, day to day expenses) I\'m probably OK with the risk that my money might get stolen (like I am with a physical wallet) in exchange for the convenience, and given that the amount in the wallet is small. This is especially true if I verify the transactions with a large bitcoin payment provider -- because I know their reputation for honesty is worth more to them than the chance to steal 0.2 btc from me.\n\n4\\) As others have noted, there are proposals for "sidechains".

Just you and the person. And what happens is that the person who downloads it gets just a teeny bit of the file passively stored on their torrenting software, similarly as the blockchain to your wallet, that, in theory, increase the efficiency and "download speed" of future participants. The efficiency, in Bitcoin\'s case, is the security and the transparency of the blockchain. If I\'m not mistaken, there are certain services which will only include the most recent chunks of the blockchain for your sake, but your transactions will still be stored on your wallet.\n\ntl;dr Just making a basic transaction with BTC contributes greatly to the security and transparency which Bitcoins is all about, no matter how inefficient that may be.

They would have the same history but different futures. Users like you and I can choose which blockchain to use. As long as each can sustain enough hash power to keep it secure they could both exist as parallel networks. Two different coins. If the networks divert to much each others miners may not be compatible with the others networks.  Of course that's rather unlikely as the market would choose the  preferred, as such it's reflected in price and miners that are able to compute the desired hashing algorithm fast enough will use it.\n\n So the network  as a set of individuals and their configurations in a pseudo-democratic matter choose the rules of the network.   \n\nYour thinking of a 51% attack. Which refers to the miners not the nodes. Truth is a 51% attack is no different than a 10%, 30%, 40%, 60%, 90% attack. The only different is the probability that the attack can do what he wants. 51% saying that the ordering of transaction he can accomplish most of the time. Even then the attacker is wrong 49% of the time so eventually confirmations that are correct occur but the probability of the network reflecting accurate ordering of transactions changes depending on the probability they will solve the block. ": 1, '> a) is this also true: "apartheid is not contentious if >50% of the voters agree to it"\n\nDepends on who\'s practicing it, and on who\'s dime. The government cannot discriminate against a minority (including the smallest minority of all, i.e. the individual) even if the majority are in favor. The difference between bitcoin and government is that the latter has a monopoly on the use of force, whereas the former is a purely voluntary system.\n\nA private individual has no such constraint, and may discriminate against any one, for any reason (and bear the consequences), as long as  that individual does not use force or fraud.\n\n\n> b) the mining pool operators are a very small percentage of the greater bitcoin community\n\nAnd that is a good thing, because it keeps them in line with what that greater community actually wants.

Not sure if that's true. It was done to close immediate DDOS vulnerabilities. Those have basically not been fixed and even further problems have been identified. It may be impossible to ever completely fix them, which is why growth is currently hard. Luckily very smart and hard working people have worked on scalability a lot over the years, improving overall efficiency and conditions for growth. 1.75MB limit is now en route and more will come. In hindsight we can definitely confirm that allowing unlimited blocks was an error by Satoshi as well.\n\nAlso a caching solution has been invented that will allow for example only 1 in 1000 or even more transactions to actually hit the blockchain, while giving full security, better anonymity and even instant transactions. That's true scaling.\n\nConfigured to unlimited or 1MB is a mere setting, but the design has inherent limits in it whether Satoshi realized them or not. 10 minutes has proven to be a pretty good choice.

Is it like an "anybody can spend" transaction or something like that?\n\nFor example, can it happen that a transaction is broadcast to the network that is considered valid by legacy nodes but invalid by SegWit nodes? If so, the legacy nodes may - at least temporarily - work on the wrong chain. "Temporarily" because if the legacy nodes are in hash power minority, their chain will eventually be overtaken by the SegWit chain, and the legacy nodes will then be working on the longest chain again. So as long as SegWit miners have >50%, the SegWit chain will be the surviving chain. But Non-SegWit miners would then be relatively easily attackable by sending "invalid" transactions to them, which make them create orphaning blocks. So as a matter of fact, any miner who wants to avoid this risk, is de-facto obliged to update to a SegWit software, and then read the complete transaction data for validation, not only the "core legacy 1MB-per_block blockchain".\n\nIs my understanding correct?\n\nI understand that this is a difference to a hardfork where both chains would be permanently split, at least theoretically. Practically the shorter hardforked chain would quickly die since miners would jump to the longer chain for economical reasons. And, as described above, in the softfork scenario the legacy nodes have to update anyways to avoid substantial economical disadvantages. So in either case, HF or SF, nodes would "have to" jump to the new software. So practically I see no scenario where there is a real difference between SF and HF.\n\nSo I do not see what is bad about a hardfork, as long as it keeps Bitcoin\'s social contract: For example an increase of block size limit (=hence a hardfork) was a clear part of Bitcoin\'s social contract ever since (remember Satoshi\'s clear statement in his post in 2010 - the 1MB was always meant as a temporary anti-spam-safeguard, nothing permanent at all), whereas keeping block size limit at 1MB for too long (=no hardfork) is AGAINST the social contract. So clearly, the question what is good/right and what is bad/wrong is not to be determined by the question whether something is a hardfork or not. I perceive this hardfork-criterion as really artificial (and hypocritical) in the discussion, and I have the impression that this criterion ("HF=evil") is used as an instrument to legitimize the interests and actions of certain groups who actually act against Bitcoin\'s social contract and legitimize their deeds with this hypocritical argument.': 1, 'Just think , the most powerful computer system ever designed and built by human beings has effectively a massive 1MB of 10 minute cache memory and is  capable of - wait for it - a staggering 3 transactions per second.

The counter party or the judge had probably to prove that their "hashing" algorithm is a fake one, which could be very hard, if it\'s a sophisticated hack. At least it leaves some room for dispute.\n\nTo avoid all this and make it 100% waterproof, I simply include a documentation of the whole process in the file to be timestamped. If that is not possible, I put it in a separate file and tar it along with the file to be timestamped and then hash the tarball. The separate file could be a script documenting the process. Also, the used hashing algorithm should be named exactly (e.g. NIST standard xyz, part abc ... aso) to make it very clear. Or just add the computer script to the tarball which does the hashing. Or best do both.\n\nAlso, it does make it easier in case you have to reproduce it in court 20 years later. \n': 1, "isn't that exactly what OP posted lol": -1, 'Advertisement: Almost any https webpage can be notarized trustlessly(well almost) with [Pagesigner](https://tlsnotary.org/pagesigner.html) and later put onto the Blockchain.': 1, 'In case I want to claim back some of my satoshis later, I could use the hash for generating a private key first and go from there (method as described above).
