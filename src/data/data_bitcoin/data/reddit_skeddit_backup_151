For the start, did you read Meni Rosenfeld\'s [Analysis of Hashrate-Based Double Spending](http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.2009)?\n\nIf we assume that attacker isn\'t able to get more than 50% of total hashrate, but has certain fixed hashrate. From that you can calculate attack success rate, which depends _only_ on number of confirmations. Inter-block time isn\'t a parameter. Furthermore, it\'s possible to calculate break-even for a given block reward.\n\nTime might appear if you consider a more complex model (e.g. attacker doesn\'t own mining equipment and has to rent it, and cost of that depends on time), but it\'s obvious that time isn\'t a fundamental parameter which affects Bitcoin security if Bitcoin works as advertised.\n\nIf you own 20% of total hashpower, probability of generating 6 blocks in a row is 0.2^6. It doesn\'t mater if interblock time is 1 minute or 10 minutes, probability is the same. It doesn\'t matter how many joules or exahashes you\'re spending on this, what matters is only your hashpower _relative_ to others. A network with smaller interblock times can figure this out faster.\n\nOK, now what if attacker is able to get more than 50% of total hashrate? In that case we\'re fucked: attack is risk-free, attacker will be able to collect _both_ block rewards and whatever profit he gets from double-spending.\n\nBut what if attacker is able to get more than 50% of total hashrate, but only for a limited amount of time? OK then, if you explicitly add time to the model, it will matter.\n\nBut this kind of an attack is irrelevant now. It was relevant in early days of Bitcoin, when mining was done on CPUs and GPUs. In that case an attacker with deep pockets could rent a lot of CPU and GPU power from a cloud service provider and pwn the network overpowering everyone else. It might be cheaper to rent resources for 10 minutes than for 1 hour, thus time matters in this case.\n\nBut now mining is done on specialized devices, and all hardware which can be useful for mining is used for mining. Even if you have a lot of money, you cannot rent 1 exahash for 10 minutes. It just physically doesn\'t exist.\n\nHence only attacks discussed in Rosenfeld\'s paper actually matter now, and time doesn\'t matter.

They weren\'t anti-technology because they feared technology, they were anti-technology because technological advances had destroyed their livelihood. In addition, the lifestyle of the factory worker (the new operator of the textile industry) was diametrically opposed to the traditionally British, small-village way of life. They were further worried about the Dickensian environments that rapid industrialization caused in England, in addition to the severing of traditional social ties that had kept families and their neighbors in the same villages for centuries. Removed from that social safety net as they moved into factory towns like Manchester and Birmingham, many people turned to alcohol abuse - so much so that it led to a public health crisis, a temperance movement, and the creation of the British "neighborhood pub" as a way to encourage men to drink beer (not gin; bootleg gin was poisoning many and was also higher alcohol content than beer) in a public place, so as to re-establish those social ties.\n\nMy point is, industrialization and indeed the rise of capitalism was not an easy, or even a natural market-driven affair. At least in England, the state intervened repeatedly to quash worker rebellions, fought the Luddites, and had to deal with peasant revolts for almost a hundred years after Enclosure, arguably the start of private property rights, began. Before Enclosure, landlords had traditionally let their tenants share a common land (the "Commons", still in use today primarily in the phrase "public commons") for grazing of their cattle. Landlords, armed by state-sponsored land surveys, decided they could enclose (hence the name) that commonly-used land and charge rent for it. The peasants, understandably upset by the reversal of hundreds of years of traditional arrangement, in addition to being made impoverished by having to pay rent on something that had previously been free, revolted. Only the intervention of the state kept multiple peasant rebellions from taking over the country.\n\nThere is nothing new with people being worried about technological progress leading to social instability. If anything, they\'re usually more right than wrong. Who knows how the rise of robots will affect the day to day life of the average working person in 30 years?\n\nThe solution to this problem is mitigation. In England, they enacted the Poor Laws, which at one point provided a guaranteed minimum income to every English citizen, in an attempt to make sure that workers displaced by progress didn\'t starve on the streets. In the US, the Great Depression almost turned the country socialist, and FDR\'s New Deal was as much about preserving capitalism by quelling discontent as it was an attempt to help the sick and elderly. The first beneficiaries of Social Security were veterans and their widows; the same veterans had camped on the National Mall in 1932 demanding a bonus for their WWI service, in no small part because of the economic downturn.\n\nThere\'s always a balance to be struck. In the long run, technological progress does lead to increases in standard of living and health. But in the short run, as with any rapid economic change, many people lose out and social orders are disrupted. That disruption can be minor or it can lead to violent revolution. The key is to find a way to minimize the social disruption while allowing a large amount of technological progress. It\'s not binary; it\'s not all one or the other. We need a mix.\n\nAnyway, this article was solely on the technological side and was downplaying the thoughts of the original Luddites, who had a very valid position. Of course, in the long run, the industrialization won out. But wouldn\'t England have been better if they had put in place, for example, an expansion in the Poor Laws such that the Luddites weren\'t driven to economic ruin by rapid industrialization? Surely avoiding 5 years of Luddite domestic terrorism and multiple decades of Dickensian development is preferable than gritting their collective teeth and getting on with it.': 2, '^Pssst...

Generally speaking, the more that common ownership or State ownership of resources is promoted, the more likely that economy falls victim to lack of market signals. The more freedom or capitalism that is allowed, however, the more that country flourishes.

That\'s because you are limiting the market mechanisms of block space.\n\n**The larger the block cap is, the stronger fee market there is. A fee market is NEVER created by artificially hard-capping blocks, because instead of users bid higher and higher, users will simply stop bidding altogether and use something else.** This results in less demand, and users won\'t pay more than they have to, resulting in the worst fee market.\n\nThere ARE valid reasons for limiting the block size, like centralization concerns. The block cap should be the highest that is acceptable for centralization; fee market plays nothing into this. **Smaller blocks do not create a bigger fee market.**\n\nThe bitcoin core devs are brilliant programmers, but they are not economists.

I\'m sure some investment groups are in it for the long haul, but I never understood why the high dollar investments were required in the industry at this time. I remember specifically Bitpay stating that they really weren\'t looking for much venture capital, but this changed when Coinbase and other started getting investment. All these companies became Stackelberg followers (I think that\'s the correct model - I\'m relying on Cunningham\'s law here). I guess they expected exponential growth, but why? I\'m wondering what would have happened if MtGox didn\'t screw up so much.\n\nRealistically, I think a lot of this block size debate is a tempest in a teapot at this point. People are arguing that explosive growth is just around the corner, but I would argue is that Bitcoin as an automaton should be able to adapt to decreasing or increasing adoption rather gracefully.
