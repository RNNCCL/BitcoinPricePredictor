For example, at the extreme end, if blocks were always 1 GB (which almost no one can support), probably the few full nodes left in existence would form "peering agreements" with each other, and you\'d have to negotiate with an existing full node to become a full node.

Look through the mailing list and my past posts for more details. One obvious and easy-to-understand issue is that in order to be a constructive network node, you need to *quickly* upload new blocks to many of your 8+ peers. So 8 MB blocks would require something very roughly like (8 MB * 8 bits * 7 peers) / 30 seconds = 15 Mbit/s upstream, which is an extraordinary upstream capacity. Since most people can\'t do this, the network (as it is currently designed) would fall apart from lack of upstream capacity: there wouldn\'t be enough total upload capacity for everyone to be able to download blocks in time, and the network would often go "out of sync" (causing stales and temporary splits in the global chain state). This problem could be fixed by having nodes download most of a block\'s transactions before the block is actually created, but this technology doesn\'t exist yet, and there\'s ongoing debate on how this could be done (there are some proposals out there for this which you may have heard of, but they aren\'t universally accepted).\n\nThere are several other major problems. Many of them can be partially fixed with additional technology, but in the absence of this technology it is imprudent to raise the limit now. If all fixable problems were fixed (probably not something that can be done in less than a couple years unless someone hires several new full-time expert Bitcoin devs to work on it), I think 8 MB would be somewhat OK, though higher than ideal, and then the max block size could grow with global upload bandwidth.': 6, "It was my understanding that Artforz didn't necessarily create an ASIC, but instead configured some FPGAs for mining.

The ROI on FPGAs was higher due to power costs, but the hash rate was considerably lower and the up front cost was a bit higher, too.

If an overwhelming number of people accept this change, the generators [miners] will also have to change if they want their coins to remain valuable.\n\nSatoshi is gone now, so it\'ll be "the developers" who set the larger limit. But it has been determined by the majority of the Bitcoin Core developers (and the majority of Bitcoin experts in general) that the network *cannot* actually safely handle significantly larger blocks, so it won\'t be done right now. And the economy has the final say, of course, not the developers.\n\nAlso see [this post of mine in 2010](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1847.msg22843#msg22843), which I think is pretty much exactly how Satoshi reasoned the future would play out, though I now believe it to be very wrong.

In reality, without the vast majority of the economy running full nodes, miners have *every incentive* to collude to break the network\'s rules in their favor.\n* The fee market doesn\'t actually work as I described and as Satoshi intended for economic reasons that take a few paragraphs to explain.': 26, '>This problem could be fixed by having nodes download most of a block\'s transactions before the block is actually created, but this technology doesn\'t exist yet, and there\'s ongoing debate on how this could be done (there are some proposals out there for this which you may have heard of, but they aren\'t universally accepted).\n\nSuch as:\nhttps://gist.github.com/gavinandresen/e20c3b5a1d4b97f79ac2\n\nBut the important thing is that it is solvable. It WILL get done. And the incentive of getting it done will increase if the blocksize increases.\n\nThe O(1) block propagation can be combined with the existing strategy, so it is not necessary to "wait" for a soft fork even. For example, if China has a bandwidth problem, then they could setup custom O(1) block propagation proxy nodes at several continents and use regular uploads from there.\n\nEDIT: Using this proxy strategy decreases the necessity of having a single node to rebroadcast the same block from the same network multiple times and thus the required uplink bandwidth at point of origin becomes virtually zero.': 2, '>They already do, but it\'s not enough to convince them to validate blocks properly, apparently... And the blocks still need to go through the proper Bitcoin network eventually.\n\nThey  do but you don\'t need that bandwidth at the point of origin. You assume that the miner needs a capacity of 15Mbit/s upstream, but that\'s not necessary. So the whole example with 8 * 8 * 7 / 30 seems wrong to me.\n\nEDIT: I do agree though that there might be potential issues if not not all transactions show up at every node (e.g. the "mintxfeerelay" issue) but it still not necessary. Just increase the number of proxy nodes until you\'re confident enough. I guess this all amounts to how you view the problem; whether the glass is half full or half empty.\n': 3}, ('TIL You can use Bitcoin to bet on the Canadian Election!', 1): {'You should have seen the bets placed on Obama to win.

Don\'t we then have 10 times more transactions processed in 10 minutes without increasing the Block-size; but by sharing the load. There would be a lot of Blocks that won\'t make it. But overall in 10 minutes 10 Mb of transactions would be processed. Should the need arise; you would split the partial payment even further. So that there are even more transactions. The Mb\'s that need to go over the network would be the same; but I am wondering if it would be more spread out among more miners (worldwide).\n\nSo pools could mine "partial payment Blocks" but only when the "key stone block" (the last one) is in place (every 10 minutes) the chain with all the partial-payments add up and the "race for the next sub-chain" starts\n\nagain...just thinking out loud :-)': 1, 'Sha hashes are evenly distributed such that finding ffff0000000 is as hard as finding 0000000ffff.

Basically the miners are searching for the correct Nonce for the Hash of all previous transactions (correct me if i am wrong)\n\nWhat is a Nonce?:\n\n,,The "nonce" in a bitcoin block is a 32-bit (4-byte) field whose value is set so that the hash of the block will contain a run of zeros. The rest of the fields may not be changed, as they have a defined meaning.\n\nAny change to the block data (such as the nonce) will make the block hash completely different. Since it is believed infeasible to predict which combination of bits will result in the right hash, many different nonce values are tried, and the hash is recomputed for each value until a hash containing the required number of zero bits is found. As this iterative calculation requires time and resources, the presentation of the block with the correct nonce value constitutes proof of work.\'\'': 2, 'Hi Jesset77, Thanks for the reply.

I'll do a voice over when I wake up since it's 2:20 am here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Jp_ddrppE)": 1, 'I\'ve read forward in your thread with /u/chalash, let me see if I can cut in on the issue a bit quicker thanks to that background.\n\n1> as his last post stated, the amount of CPU (or GPU or ASIC) power it takes to get 1 billion hashes done to a 1MB document is not appreciably greater (it\'s only about 0.1% faster) than the amount of power it takes to get 1 billion hashes against a 1 terabyte document.\n\nWhat happens is that the computer does 1 (double-)hash to the full document, first. This step is linearly faster with smaller documents, but any advantage here gets drowned out very quickly by the next step.\n\nNext, the resulting hash which is always 256 bits no matter how big the first document was is concatenated to the Nonce, the result of which is (double-)hashed again. **This** is the step which is repeated billions of times and which takes a majority of available processing power. \n\n2> Any work to make hashing "easier" for any one specific miner would equally arm both honest and dishonest miners.\n\nThe network relies on as much hashing power as possible being handled by different, competing organizations so that a minimum percentage of the global whole can band together in any one, single, potentially expensive effort to attempt a double-spend. The smaller a slice that tries this, the greater likelihood that they will fail and lose a catastrophic chunk of potential mining revenue trying (in contrast to mining honestly and keeping all of the legitimate proceeds of their efforts).\n\nAnything that makes mining easier would have zero effect on this distribution, since that advantage would be consumed both by the good guys and by the bad guys, leaving us exactly where we started.\n\nThis also means that making mining *harder* fails to upset the balance, and explains why scrypt-mining efforts such as Litecoin and Doge are able to function. In fact, if mining can be made hard enough that only CPUs, not GPU or FPGA or ASIC can participate, then that *would* actually benefit decentralization by resisting mining economies of scale somewhat. Scrypt mining was initially intended to meet this need, unfortunately GPU and later ASIC designs met the challenge all the same.\n\n3> The primary concern with increasing blocksize is how fast the blockchain will be forced to grow. Since the present protocol requires every transaction to be stored there permanently in order for the complete pedigree of every address balance to be validated beyond any potential dispute via any specific network node, no amount of splitting up of blocks can prevent our desired transaction volume from translating directly into increased blockchain size.\n': 2, 'Thanks for this.\n\nLearning as much as I can, thinking about the Block-size debate and the distribution of miners. Just thinking out loud; what if you would split the fee in a few equal parts and the "last block" in this "miner payment line" would be the one that makes the "payment of the mining-reward whole". Would this not increase the Block-size relative to the 10 minutes of time.\n\nSo for example : the reward is split in 10 pieces. The first miner adds (unique) transactions, adds a 10th of the reward and publish this Block, The second miner checks this Block and adds new transactions also for a 10th of the reward. etc...\n\nThe last Block in this (sub) chain would need an additional check to see if all previous Blocks have the 9 correct partial rewards and includes it\'s own. \n\nMy idea would be that these "partial reward" Blocks would be mined a lot faster; so the overall difficulty would stay the same only there would have been mined 10 times more transactions and (maybe) more small miners would have a piece of the pie.\n\nI am probably missing something :-)  ..but I just keep wondering if this Block-size "thing"  can be spread out to all this enormous power that is already there.': 1, 'Great explanation, thank you.

It's the one part of bitcoin that still is not nailed down in my brain.\n\nSo all transactions over the past 10 minutes are blocked together. Miners are verifying those transactions, correct?

I think I understand what you are saying, but I\'m not entirely sure. I\'ll try and answer the best I can. \n  \nIt seems that you are discussing something between decreasing the block discovery time to 1 minute and splitting individual blocks into bite-sized chunks. There are a few things to note about this.  \n  \nFirst, decreasing block discovery time without increasing block size is a viable discussion. However, using the example you gave, it would be functionally equivalent to increasing the block size to 10MB. There are some minor differences in terms of network propagation and block orphan rate, but overall the effect would be roughly the same.  \n  \nTo your second point, there is no way to really split a block into pseudo mini-blocks. These would just be new blocks. Plus, you would want to split the block reward (currently 25 BTC every ~10 minutes) into 2.5 BTC per block. Again, doable, but doesn\'t really change anything except for effective block size.\n  \nYou seem to be making a third point about letting the little guy have a piece of the action. There is literally nothing in the way of anybody being a Bitcoin miner. It is one of the most democratized playing fields ever. Indeed, many of the "big" miners today were once broke hobbyists tinkering with mining rigs. In terms of "spreading out" the payments, it is done completely fairly, with those contributing larger amounts of hashing power receiving larger payouts. If you only have enough mining power to find 1 block per year, then join a mining pool, and get 0.48 BTC per week instead of waiting for 25 BTC once every ~365 days. What you get out is related to what you put in, kind of like a relationship, I\'m told...': 1, 'Lol. Nice. I had my speakers set super high and almost fell over when the pow toon jungle came through. ': 1, 'Meh, one of those "if it ain\'t broke don\'t fix it" issues. Any change along this lines has plenty of surface area for potential bugs and problems, all code in the future would have to be able to decode both short and the new long nonces forever, etc.\n\nPlus allowing miners to squeeze one more millionth of a percent more hashes per second has no global benefit due to the fact that it would enable both attackers and defenders equally.': 2, "Yeah it seems like a good idea in theory to make such a demonstration but it's not clearly enough put together to help. I am a fairly advanced Bitcoin user and I found it assisted with the visual representation of what a block might look like. But I can easily see how that would be confusing. It's not very clear and the text goes by too fast.": 1, 'Right on. Well you could have fooled me \xf0\x9f\x98\x80': 2, 'I think that /u/chalash\'s explanation is a very good one, but if I were asking your question I can think of several points left unexplained I would probably still be after.\n\nThe "needle" being looked for is a hash result of combining the transactions you (the miner) want to notarize (nobody can force you to notarize any specific transactions, but any that have fees you can\'t get the fees unless you choose to include them!) with a random number called a Nonce, such that the entire hash works out to be an integer smaller than the present difficulty setting. This is a little bit like trying to limbo below a bar set by one of the winners who came before you. :J\n\nSo you ball up all of the transactions you are fond of into a document, and you add a random number Nonce onto that, and you hash it. Was the hash low enough? Darn, no it wasn\'t. Better try again. But since it\'s only been a microsecond since your first try, the transactions you want to endorse have not changed so the only thing you *can* change in order to try to get a new hash is the Nonce. And that\'s why there is a Nonce, to give you that degree of freedom to try a few billion permutations against an unchanging document and see if any of those resulting hashes win the lottery for you.\n\nNow that difficulty is set *just* at the right place, that with every miner\'s computer in the world all working at the same time, it will take *about* ten minutes on average for **any** of them to find a single hash that wins the limbo.\n\nOnce found, you pass that block around to everybody as fast as you can. Every block not only notarizes transactions, but the previous block so you want to make sure whoever finds the next block is trying to notarize *your* block. They can\'t do that unless you\'ve gotten yours out, but on the other hand if they do have your block (and your block is valid and clean as a whistle) then they *will* want to notarize it because everyone tries to make the chain as long as possible, so every valid piece is unspeakably valuable towards that end. Anyone missing a piece stands a chance of being left behind by the rest of the network and you don\'t get to keep your reward money (stipend + fees) if your block saying that you won those things gets orphaned by everybody else. :P\n\nThat is also the power that keeps the blocks honest. Any block that lies, or tries to notarize a transaction that was never properly signed, or creates inappropriate bitcoins out of thin air, or isn\'t endorsing the longest chain to come before it (by way of "doesn\'t end up being the longest chain once your block is mined") or adds into the document *any single thing* not allowed to be there.. or who *omits* any specific thing that is *required* to be there, will be shunned by the rest of the network.\n\nSo that tells what the hay is made of and what the needle is shaped like. So who decides how much hay, or when and how to adjust the size of the haystack? That happens as part of the rules mentioned above. every 2016 blocks (EG, approximately every 2 weeks) the next block MUST choose a new difficulty setting, and that difficulty setting MUST lie within a range mathematically prescribed by how long it took the last 2016 blocks to get mined. So one miner chooses the value and puts it in their block, and the value had *better* toe the line from everyone else\'s perspective or that whole block would be abandoned by the network.\n\nAnd that\'s how the difficulty grows and shrinks to suit how much power is doing the mining work over time, so that blocks always average to 10 minutes. :D\n\n': 5, "I'm seriously debating purchasing some lego and making this lol.

The small businesses claimed (without evidence) the larger Chicago firms were selling tainted meat. \n\nNot letting the opportunity go to waste, the larger firms also pushed for increased regulation - knowing the smaller businesses would not be able to afford the cost of regulation. \n\nA 1906 [study by the Burea of Agriculture](https://books.google.com/books?id=xGU-AAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Hearings+Before+the+Committee+on+Agriculture...on+the+So-called+%22Beveridge+Amendment%22+to+the+Agricultural+Appropriation+Bill,&source=bl&ots=3j6Qi_MOvS&sig=5n7JIhK1-PVpyaDe8GEb7-froBI&hl=en&ei=LNCTTIXbGYL2tgOlrqDACg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result#v=onepage&q&f=false) claimed Sinclair was "intentionally misleading", "deliberate misrepresentation of fact", and "utterly absurd."\n\nHowever, the Chicago firms were right. Smaller business could not afford to pay the inspectors and increased cost of doing business that regulations bring. Many went out of business and since that day forward the US meat industry has organized itself into a state-based system of supply and command. \n\nMaybe stop referencing fiction books as fact, huh?

To aid the technical consensus building\nprocess we are organizing a pair of workshops to collect technical\ncriteria, present proposals and evaluate technical materials and data with\nacademic discipline and analysis that fully considers the complex tradeoffs\nbetween decentralization, utility, security and operational realities. This\nmay be considered as similar in intent and process to the NIST-SHA3 design\nprocess where performance and security were in a tradeoff for a security\ncritical application.\n\nSince Bitcoin is a P2P currency with many stakeholders, it is important to\ncollect requirements as broadly as possible, and through the process\nenhance everyone\xe2\x80\x99s understanding of the technical properties of Bitcoin to\nhelp foster an inclusive, transparent, and informed process.\n\nThose with technical interest are invited to participate in this pair of\nworkshops with the following intent:\n\nPhase 1: Scene setting, evaluation criteria, and tradeoff analysis.\n\nMontreal, Canada: September 12th-13th, 2015\n\nScalability is not a single parameter; there are many opportunities to make\nthe Bitcoin protocol more efficient and better able to service the needs of\nits growing userbase. Each approach to further scaling the Bitcoin\nblockchain involves implicit trade offs of desired properties of the whole\nsystem. As a community we need to raise awareness of the complex and subtle\nissues involved, facilitate deeper research and testing of existing\nproposals, and motivate future work in this area.\n\nThe purpose of this workshop is to discuss the general tradeoffs and\nrequirements of any proposal to scale Bitcoin beyond its present limits.\nSession topics are to include the presentation of experimental data\nrelating to known bottlenecks of Bitcoin\xe2\x80\x99s continued growth and analysis of\nimplicit tradeoffs involved in general strategies for enabling future\ngrowth.\n\nThis event will not host sessions on the topic of any specific proposals\ninvolving changes to the Bitcoin protocol. Such proposals would be the\ntopic of a 2nd, follow-on Phase 2 workshop described below; this event is\nintended to \xe2\x80\x9cset the stage\xe2\x80\x9d for work on and evaluation of specific\nproposals in the time between the workshops.\n\nPhase 2 will be planned out further as part of Phase 1 with input from the\nparticipants.\n\nPhase 2: Presentation and review of technical proposals, with simulation,\nbenchmark results.\n\nHong Kong, SAR, China: TBD Nov/Dec 2015\n\nHopefully to be easier for the Chinese miners to attend, the second\nworkshop pertaining to actual block size proposals is to be planned for\nHong Kong roughly in the late November to December timeframe.\n\nThe purpose of this workshop is to present and review actual proposals for\nscaling Bitcoin against the requirements gathered in Phase 1. Multiple\ncompeting proposals will be presented, with experimental data, and compared\nagainst each other. The goal is to raise awareness of scalability issues\nand build a pathway toward consensus for increasing Bitcoin\xe2\x80\x99s transaction\nprocessing capacity or, barring that, identify key areas of further\nrequired research and next steps for moving forward.\n\nPreliminarily, Phase 2 will be a time to share results from experiments\nperformed as a result of Phase 1 and an opportunity to discuss new\ndevelopments.\n\nHow do the Workshops work?\n\n   -\n\n   Both events will be live-streamed with remote participation facilitated\n   via IRC for parallel online discussion and passing questions to the event.\n   -\n\n   These workshops aim to facilitate the existing Bitcoin Improvement\n   Proposals (BIP)[1] process. Most work will be done outside of the workshops\n   in the intervening months.

Registration begins August 12th at an early-bird\n   ticket price of $150 USD until September 3rd. The ticket prices do not come\n   close to covering the venue expense and travel subsidies, hence the need\n   for corporate sponsors.\n   -\n\n   Please see the FAQ at scalingbitcoin.org which should answer most other\n   questions.\n\n\nTravel Subsidies for Independent/Academic Researchers\n\nThere will be an application process for independent or academic\nresearchers to apply for travel assistance to help cover the expense of\nairfare and hotel fees up to $1,000 per qualified presenter who intends to\ngive a presentation.
