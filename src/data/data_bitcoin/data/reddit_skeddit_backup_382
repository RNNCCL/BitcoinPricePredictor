The relevance of this in relation to our history is great, but its importance is highlighted further when understood in relation to the Bretton-Woods system which emerged from WII:\n\n>    The chief features of the Bretton Woods system were an obligation for each country to adopt a monetary policy that maintained the exchange rate by tying its currency to gold and the ability of the IMF to bridge temporary imbalances of payments. Also, there was a need to address the lack of cooperation among other countries and to prevent competitive devaluation of the currencies as well.\n\nThis system was meant to be created and implemented BEFORE the end of the war.

Eventually the system gave way to \xe2\x80\x9cpolitical pressure\xe2\x80\x9d largely through what is known as the Nixon Shock:\n\n>    While Nixon\xe2\x80\x99s actions did not formally abolish the existing Bretton Woods system of international financial exchange, the suspension of one of its key components effectively rendered the Bretton Woods system inoperable. While Nixon publicly stated his intention to resume direct convertibility of the dollar after reforms to the Bretton Woods system had been implemented, all attempts at reform proved unsuccessful. By 1973, the Bretton Woods system was replaced de facto by a regime based on freely floatingfiat currencies that remains in place to the present day.\n\nLooking at the history of money, it seems we are in great need of some form of an unbreakable, politically incorruptible, standard for economic consensus.\n\nhttps://thewealthofchips.wordpress.com/2015/07/05/the-relevant-history-of-money-and-economics/': 1}, ('Let this sink in: #Bitcoin is now being referenced in the media as the main haven asset during a sovereign debt crisis. #Gold has taken a back seat!', 1284): {'http://imgur.com/gallery/MDhbuT6': 122}, ('Is there a cafe in Greece that accepts Bitcoin?', 84): {"It's the logic of the butterfly effect.

I seem to be trapped in some Through the Looking Glass world where suddenly most of the devs are hell bent on deterring anyone from using bitcoin.

(Kindly provided in an online version by Gregory Maxwell.)\n\nDuring the July 4th fork, it looked like 50% or maybe more of network hash rate was SPV mining.  When F2Pool said they had switched back to full validation mining, that meant about about 30% of hash rate was probably still SPV mining.  So put those numbers into the calculator:\n\n- (0.3, 30) = 0.000152234 = 0.015% attack probability = 1/6,700 chance.\n\nThat is pretty low because we were playing it safe.  But what if we had guessed wrong just a little and there was still 35% of hash rate SPV mining?  Thirty confirmations wouldn't mean so much then:\n\n- (0.35, 30) = 0.00552425 = 0.055% = 1/181 chance\n\nChance of what, you ask?  Chance of your wallet saying a transaction has **30 confirmations** none of which are valid because your wallet is on the invalid chain.\n\nPeople already assume 6 confirmations is more than sufficient.  Let's run the math on six confirmations but only assume that 25% is SPV mining (which is my best guess of the current amount based on the second (July 5th) fork):\n\n- (0.25, 6) = 0.0499426 = 5% = 1/20 chance\n\nIf you're receiving a large transaction, wouldn't you like to know that waiting six confirmations means there's still a 1/20 chance the payment could be reversed?  In short, I don't think the recommendation for 30 confirmations is excessive, and as the Bitcoin.org notice says, it will be reduced if miners decided to return to full validation (which sadly, [some aren't planning to](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=700411.msg11790734#msg11790734)).\n\n> To spend bitcoins and get them refunded you have to know when a fork is coming (unlikely)\n\nThis is an ongoing event.  There have been [two forks so far](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/July_2015_Forks) and there will probably be more.  Again, the math for this is accessible.  If 4% of miners haven't upgraded so are still producing v2 blocks, that's 1/25 blocks on average being v2.  If 25% of hash rate is still SPV mining (without additional checks), then 1/4 times a v2 block is produced, they'll extend it.  So about 1/100 blocks is likely to cause a fork, and there are 144 blocks on average a day---so about a fork a day, maybe more.\n\nAttackers can do this math too, and they manage to pull off unconfirmed double spends [quite often](http://respends.thinlink.com/).  Now they have an opportunity to pull off confirmed double spends with high probability.  For example, they can keep rotating their bitcoins in and out of an exchange.  LocalBitcoins accepts 3-confirmed transactions, so if you have $40,000 in bitcoins, you can deposit and withdraw $10,000 in BTC every block, attempting to double spend it.  When a fork happens, you see if your double spend was successful.  It it was, you quickly sell your bitcoins for cash and you've made $10,000 at the expense of LocalBitcoins and their customers.\n\nAnd, really, wouldn't you rather have the devs play it safe?

If so, what were the modifications?\n\nSort of.  Most miners run patched Bitcoin Cores, but this problem was caused by a "feature" of their pool software that allowed them to mine on blocks without validating them first.\n\n> Did F2Pool realize that the BIP66 rules had already started to apply when they received B\'(N) from BTCNuggets?\n\nYes.  Their Bitcoin Core rejected the block, but they mined on it anyway because of the way their pool software was programmed to mine on the longest chain no matter what.\n\n> In the standard version of the v3 core software, do miners get the whole parent node and verify its validity?\n\nYes, Bitcoin Core always verifies all blocks, and Bitcoin Core 0.9.5 and higher knows how to validate v3 blocks.\n\n> Could there be an off-by-one bug in the v3 core software, that would have resulted in F2Pool verifying B\'(N) with pre-BIP66 rules instead of BIP66 rules?\n\nThere can always be bugs, but that\'s not what happened here.  You can read the IRC logs from the event; F2Pool\'s operator is `wangchun` http://bitcoinstats.com/irc/bitcoin-dev/log/2015/07/04\n\nIn particular see his response to /u/phantomcircuit here: http://bitcoinstats.com/irc/bitcoin-dev/logs/2015/07/04#l1435999111.0\n\n> If F2Pool knew that BIP66 was in effect, and got B\'(N) from a v2-running miner or node: why was it still accepting transactions, blocks, and block headers from v2-running players\n\nIt was skipping verification so that it could lower its stale block (orphan block) rate.  According to Wang Chun in the logs above, they used to have a 4% stale rate; before the fork, they had a 0.5% rate.  That\'s a massive difference in profit for a pool the size of F2Pool, which is why they\'re still doing SPV mining even after losing $25,000 to the fork.\n\n> If a miner receives a block B(M), how many blocks B(M), B(M-1), B(M-2) etc. should it validate on its own before daring to mine B(M+1) on top of it?\n\nAll of them.

Should it broadcast B(M+1), or wait until the verification of B(M) is complete?\n\nFor the benefit of users, it should wait.  For the benefit of profits, it might not be worth waiting.
