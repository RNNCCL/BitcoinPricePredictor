But I keep coming back to paper wallets with BIP38 for a variety of reasons - and espectially for long term cold storage. For one, they can be spent easily with apps like Mycelium, although these wallet developers need to be more consistent on how they treat change addresses to avoid someone inadvertently sending btc to an address they don't know about or control. Ideally, wallet apps in the settings shoudl allow you to decide how to treat change addresses (ie whiuch address to send change, or to send it back to the same address). And there should be reminders along the way in the user interface to make it clear where change address is going. \n\nWith bip38 paper wallets, you can create a bunch and keep them in many locations. alumnium and steel cards are cool, but there is no substitute for storing your paper wallets in multiple physical locations to avoid risks of fire, theft, etc.. and keeping bip38 passphrases in other secure locations.  I also think splitting them into a many paper wallets is the way to go to address spending issues so that you don't expose your btc holdings to the internet - thus preserving cold storage benefits. \n\nI shoudl say that at present, I only like  bip38 wallets for long term cold storage. I suggest 100% cotton paper for preservation benefits. \n\nI think as far as business opportunities, we need more paper wallet generators that have nicer designs. bitaddress.org is great in terms of functionality, but let's face it, the design stinks - with or without artwork. I don't know why there aren't more elegantly designed templates that are opensource. \n\nIn the future, I see companies, individuals and maybe even governments adopting paper wallets branded with their own identities for consumers to use, but only with bip38 of course to avoid theft. The design aspects of paper wallets is as of yet a largely untapped business area, in my opinion. I don't like the tri-fold format, but prefer a single note similar to a paper currency note.

This paper is NOT easy to come by and intaglio printing is not cheap, I've been trying to work with paper suppliers/printers to see how to best do this.\n\nAnd then there's the security side. Matched serial numbers on the bills and a holographic sticker covering the private key? BIP38? Depends on whether these are designed for exchange vs. personal storage.

But with paper you don't need the hassle ": 1, "Bitcoins are often co pared to electronic gold. In your case, this Gold might be lost forever, if you can't pass it on to others. Our brain is much less durable than most sherts of paper on earth. ": 1, "Paper wallets serve two main purposes. First, paper wallets are an easy way for a Bitcoin user to give bitcoin to a beginner. That's a pretty big deal when you think about it. I noticed that there wasn't very good documentation for what exactly a new recipient should do with their paper wallet, so I wrote this:\n\nhttp://bitzuma.com/posts/how-to-spend-a-bitcoin-paper-wallet-in-three-easy-steps/\n\nThe second purpose paper wallets serve is long term savings. The main concern is security. A paper wallet needs to be generated and used within a secure environment. There are simply too many attack vectors to be doing this on a network connected computer. This is where paper wallets start to break down.\n\nAfter looking at this from a number of angles and trying to find the best practices from security experts, my conclusion is that Electrum set up in online/offline mode  is many times simpler to set up and administer securely. But you have to look at the whole board to see it.\n\nOne of the hidden gotchas of a paper wallet used for cold storage is making a withdrawal. Unless change goes to a new address, you leak privacy. Unless you sign from an offline environment, you could leak your private key. Secure cold storage withdrawal from a paper wallet requires a tool that doesn't yet exist.\n\nI used to think the answer was to make that tool. But having seen how Electrum solves the problem of managing disposable keypairs, making backups by just writing down 12 words, and solving the offline signing problem, I've changed my mind.\n\nI'm not saying Electrum is the only answer, but a deterministic wallet with offline signing capability might well be.\n\nStandards are starting to coalesce around this idea. For example BIPs 32, 39, and 44. With the release of Trezor and integration of it into Electrum and other wallets, the right elements seem to be materializing to solve the bitcoin storage problem in a way that non technical people can actually use.\n\nAll that said, I still use paper wallets.

Speaking as a desktop technician with a penchant for all things PC-related, here\'s what I\'d try first, then go from there:\n\nSide-note: always try booting into safe mode to see if you can access your data to back it up, and potentially remove the ransomware without having to do anything I\'ve listed below.\n\n----------------------------\n\nPLEASE NOTE: This process takes a long time. If you have absolutely no patience (or simply no idea how) to fix your computer, just bring it to a small repair shop as opposed to Best Buy or Staples...small shops do the crazy stuff that the big box stores won\'t, and get more reliable and thorough results...unless they\'re simply scum. In fact, I can tell you with 100% certainty that Best Buy only uses one CD for software/some hardware issues that they can\'t find an outsourced solution for, and that\'s what you\'re *really* paying them $200-$300 for...but I digress.\n\n----------------------------\n\nIMPORTANT: Make sure you have a method of reinstalling your operating system if the need arises. If you bought your PC prebuilt from a big box store (Best Buy, Staples, etc), your Product Key can usually be found on the case somewhere, or by calling them up as they should have your info on file.\n\n* download/install DrWeb or another Linux OS onto a CD or USB drive. I prefer DrWeb as the OS is designed for tough virus removal and nothing else.\n\n* boot into the CD/USB drive and back up any user data you need, another USB drive or external storage medium would be ideal. Keep the device plugged into your computer to scan it with DrWeb\'s tools.\n\nNOTE: If this fails, try using cloud-based storage. Usually I tell people not to use to cloud, but it\'s hard to deny that it has its uses, especially in this situation.\n\n* attempt to remove the ransomware from your main OS using DrWeb\'s built-in tools, use any other Linux-friendly tools you can find. I\'ll assume your OS is Windows, because, well, yea...viruses.\n\n* if virus removal fails, take note of all installed programs and format your hard drive. If the option is there, do NOT use "Quick Format", instead choose the longer and more thorough format. \n\n* reinstall OS and restore your data, then boot into safe mode. Run any Windows-friendly tools you have. McAfee, Norton\'s Antivirus, and AVG do not count, unless you\'re using a rootkit version of those softwares. I think McAfee has one that\'s pretty good, and you should also check out McAfee Stinger. Avoid the regular AV software, it\'s just not powerful enough.\n\nAt this point you can boot into Windows normally and hope for the best. Don\'t get me wrong, the format will have almost definitely removed it, but your user data may still be infected, hence the scans in safe mode.\n\nI sincerely wish you the best of luck...ransomware is no walk in the park, but when it comes to computers you should know there\'s ALWAYS a way to beat viruses.

I like blockchain.info\'s wallet, as well as breadwallet.  But for the average Joe, these things cause frustration, annoyance, and sometimes loss of funds.  And guess who the culprit is perceived to be by the average dude?  Bitcoin.  No one said it\'s fair.  Or rationale.  It\'s just how it is.\n\n\n\nIf bitcoin were to magically skyrocket in popularity, the predominant user experience would likely represent thoughts, such as "No one can figure out this new payment processor" or "Another person lost funds today."\n\n\nIf we\'re going to really advocate this for mainstream adoption, the supporting ecosystem needs to be rock-solid.  Which means, all the various related\xe2\x80\x94but unrelated\xe2\x80\x94bitcoin services need to get their act together.\n\n\nFailure at larger scales is no fun, especially once the media frenzy get involved (as we\'ve seen with MTGox).

You could argue that with a shorter blocktime an attack is cheaper so an attacker has more chances, eg. with 6s block times an attacker has 100x more chances, but that effect is linear, whereas the effect of adding more confirmations is exponential - assuming 30% hashpower, waiting for 12 confirmations instead of 6 reduces the probability of a fork succeeding by a factor of 161, so you get the same security in 72 seconds that Bitcoin gives you in 3600. \n\n> If you see a cryptocurrency with short block target times, but still not a considerable amount of orphaned blocks, you know that the network of that coin is not properly decentralized, but rather centralized.\n\nThere are ways around this problem; see https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/07/11/toward-a-12-second-block-time/': 17, "I'm talking about ACH vs SEPA sort of thing. \n\nFor example in Canada an EFT (our equivalent of ACH) will take me 1-2 days to send between my accounts at different banks.

I have it set up so he sends me a Tangerine email money transfer and it gets deposited instantly into my account for free without me even needing to click a button. Now this happens because it is a change made on Tangerine's own internal ledger where Tangerines systems (made by IBM) just say -$50 on Bobs account, +$50 on Joe's account. This is instant as Tangerine is reliant on no one but themselves to preform these actions.\n\nNow if I want to send money to PayPal this is no longer 1 ledger where a balance must be changed. Instead Tangerine must do an EFT to PayPal which means my bank dealing with the central bank which deals with PayPal and any other intermediaries that might be involved. This means relying on different ledgers operated by different banks and a reliance on the transfer mechanisms that allow banks to interact with each other. It is no longer under PayPal or Tangerine's control as to how fast it goes.\n\nNow if you look at a country like the UK where all bank transfers are instant or the EuroZone's  SEPA transfers that take only a few hours vs a few days, then it makes a big difference as to how fast PayPal can do their job and interface with the ledgers of banks beyond their own.": 2, 'I think I replied to the wrong comment.': 2, '> The joke also overlooks the fact that it\'s much cheaper to double spend on the networks with lower hash rates than bitcoin.\n\nThis is equivalent to "English with spelling reform is inferior to current English because nobody is used to reading the spelling-reformed version now".

Rotating elevator in low orbit (7.5 km/s) has tips moving at 2.4 km/s counter to orbit at the bottom (200 km altitude).  Thus tip moves at 7.5-2.4 = 5.1 km/s relative to the Earth, or 4.64 km/s relative to the Equator (because the Earth rotates).\n\nThe projectile does a rendezvous with the tip of the rotating elevator, hangs on for half a rotation, and lets go at the top, which is moving at 7.5 + 2.4 = 9.9 km/s.  This is enough to transfer to high orbit, where a second rotating elevator catches you and sends you to a further destination.\n\nThe combined length of the two elevators is 1500 km, which is much less than the simplistic single cable version which is 70-90,000 km long.  Hypersonic guns are just one way to get stuff to the first elevator, but they are well suited to small payloads.  [Such guns](http://www.arnold.af.mil/shared/media/photodb/photos/2013%5C07%5C130723-O-0000U-001.jpg) have been around for [decades](http://html2.free.fr/canons/harp/canbarbad.jpg) for research.': 2, 'To the moon!!! \xe2\x94\x97(\xc2\xb00\xc2\xb0)\xe2\x94\x9b ^.^.^\xe2\x97\x8b \n\nDamn right. 2040 bits /u/changetip': 8, "Anyone know what's doing the visual effects there?

The Earth rotates faster than the Moon orbits.  Therefore the tides generated by the Moon move ahead of the line connecting the centers.  These tides happen in rock as well as the oceans.\n\nWhen you treat the Earth as round + a bulge gravitationally, that bulge is pulling the Moon forward in its orbit.  This is raising the Moon's orbit, and at the same time slowing the Earth's rotation.  Both effects have been measured.\n\n> Isn't this a doomsday device? \n\nWhen you ask a question like this, you need to consider how big an effect is involved, and how big is it compared to other things already happening.": 2, 'Oh man, this is going on my epitaph.

You fire the pin into a planet's moon, and allow the attachment of a pre calculated length and mass to dangle in the planet's upper atmosphere for centuries. You could adjust the length and mass based on exact calculations to attain the desired fall temporals. This would prove one hell of a weapon since it is simple, exact, temporally adjustable, and has no moving parts that could fail after attachment.": 3, 'Would the relays be of different kinds?

It's written up in [Section 4.10](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Space_Transport_and_Engineering_Methods/Space_Elevator) of the textbook I put online.\n\nTo put it in terms a bitcoiner will understand, the pictures you usually see of a single cable connected to the Earth are a centralized single point of failure.  A safer engineering design is a distributed network of multiple cables connected to each other.  One way to connect them is by orbital mechanics rather than ultra-long cables.  A series of smaller elevators that relay payloads is much cheaper than one big one.\n\nAlthough I think they will be very useful in the future, the truth is the world only launched 32 payloads last year to higher orbits.  A space elevator of any type is transportation infrastructure, like a bridge or airport.  You don't build those for 32 trips a year, they are just not economic, and neither is an elevator.  You either have to wait until there is more traffic, or start very small and build up to larger elevators over time.  Research and prototypes is fine, and is happening today.  It takes time to develop a new technology.\n\n": 2}}}
