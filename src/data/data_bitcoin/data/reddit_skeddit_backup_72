There is currently so much value that even a slight change in the protocol such as the blocksize cap is being seen as risky. This is a stabilizing feature as it instills confidence and predictability in the future of Bitcoin even if the protocol isn't as efficient as it could be (if for example the blocksize cap were raised or removed entirely). Predictable expectations and risk minimization trump efficiency.

Miners would be on a network that few want to buy coins from; others would be on a network susceptible to 51% attacks due to a low hash rate. \n\nPerhaps lots of full nodes reduces any short term gain miners could capture, but long term it seems like miners would still be overcome even if there weren\'t many full nodes today.': 1, "Your understanding is correct, but you underestimate the incentives parties have.

The question though is, why do these properties endure? And the answer is pretty simple: because they can. Socioeconomic fashions rise and wane, but as soon as pressure is relieved off the socioeconomic properties of gold, they reappear organically.\n\nThere are alternative candidates to gold, but they are either valued much less, or valued (in the socioeconomic sense) not at all. Reasons for this may include:\n\n* Toxicity\n* Radioactivity\n* Too brittle, soft or hard or generally difficult to work with\n* Too abundant or too scarce\n* Too reactive with other elements\n* Combustible or easy to oxidize\n\nIf gold would not exist, maybe one or another of these would take golds place. But Gold does exist, and outperforms the alternatives.\n\nIf you are diminishing the socioeconomic properties of Bitcoin at a protocol level, they cannot arise organically anymore.

Abundance is an important factor for money because something has to be scarce enough to be worth something (i.e. lead is not a good money because obvious).

For instance palladium (for reasons of scarcity, difficulty in refining and occurence only in alloys) is also not good money, because it\'s not cognizable and common enough.\n\nThis is a long-winded way of saying, things have to be sufficiently available (and recognizable) enough, so that everybody can establish an opinion on its worth.\n\nIf you deprive a money of its availability and cognizability, then nobody will have an idea how to establish its value. Bitcoins are not abundant (or scarce) in the "extraction" kind of sense. But simply extracting something does not establish its worth. Paladium is extracted and refined, but that doesn\'t make it valuable as a money. In order for that extraction to have a purpose in the sense of a money, the money has to be accessible to society so that everybody can establish an idea of its value.\n\nThe idea to use bitcoin as the underlying commodity to be used by a second-tier system is hinged on the idea that bitcoins are worth something. Value is established by consensus, and that consensus is expressed when the money is used in its role as a medium of exchange, a store of value and a source of liquidity (that\'s what exchanges do btw).\n\nIt\'s very simple to understand that if you deprive your "money" fundamentally of the ability to act as a medium of exchange, a store of value and a source of liquidity, in order for it to act as an underlying for your second tier, that you are building your castle on sand, because now your money has no value anymore.

This can\'t happen without sacrificing some level of decentralization. People disagree about how much decentralization would be sacrificed, but in general people in this second school of thought think that the amount of decentralization that would be lost is completely acceptable, and that the growth of the coin would justify the loss, and then that the growth of the coin would itself be a source of decentralization, and that the growth would bring more smart people on board who could solve Bitcoin\'s problems more quickly.\n\nAnd that\'s not really a rift you can heal.

Both groups can get what they want, without mediation.\n\nEthereum\'s not the only choice. We could do an intentional hard-fork, where one side of the network upgrades to 2MB and changes the POW algorithm, but to me that seems like it would be a lot messier than just having people migrate currencies.

In fact, this was the original motivation for Wuille and others to explore the Segregated Witness concept.\n\n> Transaction malleability is caused by a cryptographic trick to change a signature, without changing what that signature stands for. This can be done, moreover, without the private key used to create the original signature. In Bitcoin's case, this means that anyone can pick any transaction from the peer-to-peer network, and alter the signature into an equally valid signature. This new signature still reflects the exact same data it originally signed, and it can still be verified using the same public key. It doesn't change what a transaction does at all. But because it looks different, it does completely change the transaction ID.\n\n> Transaction malleability causes two main problems.

They are hosted by individuals on more diverse hardware and network endpoints. But if they were, yes. \n\nGenerally speaking, from a network security perspective, it is considered best to own your own hardware and internet connection when you run a node. This ensures the least dependence on centralized policy, such as on AWS. From a practical perspective, an overabundance of nodes within a single datacenter, such as an AWS site provides little value to the network: the nodes do not help create a complex mesh with other independent nodes, but rather cluster together behind the infrastructure of the VPS provider: the connection graph will be nearly bipartate with one or two bridges between the AWS nodes and the real network at Amazon's routers: central points of failure. \n\nIn reality, having one, or two nodes for redundancy inside each AWS datacenter is probably sufficient from the perspective of securing the network.\n\n\nWe _do_ know, however, that it is a common practice among Classic supporters to run many vps nodes to create the appearance of support for classic, since in the olden days, one node roughly corresponded to one user. This rubs us the wrong way as it comes across as dishonest, but mostly underscores the fact that node count has little to do with network support of one implementation or another, and reemphasizes the fact that in this sort of situation, only hash rate and user economic support mean anything as long as there are at least a few nodes.": 2, "Probably less latency for a US to US connection than going through China's firewall though!": 1, 'Yeah real node with high latency': 1, 'Nodes are increasing and those are not fake.

Now everyone knows, and you are probably wasting your money. \n\nI appreciate your long-term interest in the project, and assume you probably have the best long-term interests of bitcoin at heart, but you are basically cheating a metric to make your side of the debate look more popular.\n\nI think the fact that users admit to running multiple nodes... and that so many nodes are in AWS probably makes it look less genuine. \n\nFact is: because of how easily gameable it is, node count means nothing, and hashrate is the only important metric.

If Amazon becomes hostile to Bitcoin... POOF nodes gone. Not to mention that they do very little to decentralize the connection graph... AWS nodes by location are all sort of in the same datacenter. Sure, you can send traffic to all of them, but it all goes through the same routers.

Kind of like marching in the streets in protest. It has little practical value, but it has influence, and that influence makes it worth it if that's what you believe in.\n\nThis isn't an important point, but I think also that one or two nodes per data center would still be low. Because that would mean only one or two users are taking advantage of that entire data center to host a bitcoin node. And if that's just some dude in Kansas whose credit card expires, then the node shuts off and we've temporarily lost all the potential of that whole data center. For the simple purpose of redundancy, more sounds like a good idea.\n\nI also believe that outside of just the Core/Classic issue, this is likely to be a development that re-occurs in future client debates. AWS is very popular now, and this is just sort of how a lot of people deploy things these days. I remember about a year ago, even before the whole debate got any big, there was a service that let you spin up regular Core nodes on AWS by paying to a bitcoin address. That wasn't for any kind of propaganda - regular users saw it as a cool, helpful thing. The current ones are just replicas of that same idea for Classic.
