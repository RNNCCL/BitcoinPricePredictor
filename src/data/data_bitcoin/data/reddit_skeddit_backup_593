It was called "print" and it had the mysterious property of preserving things written and said for future times.\n\nOn a related noted I actually *talked* with Chuck Palahuinik *about* Fight Club in 2002 when I was attending the University of Oregon and had a conversation about this very subject, so there\'s that.\n\nThe bottom line is that film and literature has its own language, and understanding that language is necessary to understand the works. You quite clearly only understood a very limited selection of the :words" being spoken in this particular work but seem to have convinced yourself that your understanding is accurate and complete, like a guy that knows ten words of German convincing himself he knows enough to have understood today\'s Der Spiegel. You missed the message. That\'s fine. It happens. What it really isn\'t though is a matter of subjective opinion in this case. \n\nBut if you want to tell yourself "it\'s all just a matter of interpretation" go right ahead. I am sure you think Born In the U.S.A. was a patriotic pro war, pro corporate song too. \n': 1, 'So what you are saying is that Tyler Durden captured the narcissitic, childish, violent, fascistic impulses of a generation? I agree. Because that is what Tyler Durden *actually* represented. That you think an entire generation was too stupid to understand that yet still worship the guy as a hero when quite clearly he was meant to be a charismatic *villain* is disturbing to put it mildly.': 1, 'The point is not that Uber is some perfectly free system, but that it is more free and decentralized; and therefore disruptive.': 4, '>Good art after all, is often an entirely subjective experience.\n\nThe "but art is subjective, man" is kind of a cop-out for literary interpretation. In this case, we don\'t have to guess, because we have the actual words of the creators of both the book and the movie to tell us what their works were about. Now certainly you are entitled to interpret things however you want, but that doesn\'t make your interpretation an accurate understanding of the works any more than having an "interpretation" of speeding laws will be a valid defense in a court of law. In short, there are better and worse arguments for particular interpretations. If someone argued that Fight Club was actually about the 12th century floral dress trade in Scandinavia, well, you can reasonably say that isn\'t a very fair interpretation of the work. Of course, they might defend their interpretation by saying "art is an entirely subjective experience," but I am sure you would agree that their subjective interpretation is about as useful and insightful as having a person that only knows Chinese translating Medieval french texts. That is to say, they can certainly spit out a bunch of nonsense and claim it is meaningful, but it probably doesn\'t provide much insight into what was being communicated in the original work. \n\nIn this case, what you don\'t seem to have grasped is that the movie quite overtly critiques the very idea of an Ubermensch by illustrating how quickly that line of thinking descends into fascism. Tyler Durden goes from a protagonist to an antagonist at precisely the point that "Jack" realizes this. Tyler Durden seeks to *destroy* the reality as a childish reaction to his confusion and dissatisfaction with his position. He is the embodiment of Jack\'s violent overreaction to his feelings of emasculation at the hands of a consumerist culture. This is why at the end of the movie Jack becomes whole by "killing" Tyler Durden, who is of course a harmful and destructive aspect of himself that has prevented him from truly accepting his reality in an adult fashion. His killing of Durden and embracing Marla while the towers fall is a powerful way of saying "I accept my destructive past even though it was wrong and now I am ready to move on *together* in the decidedly *social* act of *love* rather than as an angsty, violent, hypermasculine malcontent." In other words, Jack was *rejecting* the very shit you are celebrating in your post. \n\nSo, when you say "hey it\'s just a matter of interpretation" what I am saying is not only is your interpretation wrong, it is actually the *exact opposite* of the message that was being sent. This isn\'t because the interpretation is subjective, it is because you didn\'t actually fully understand the work. Thus the fact that you are essentially using the work to promote a message that is *the exact opposite* of the works intended message is kind of like Mitt Romney playing [Born In the U.S.A.](http://www.lyricsfreak.com/b/bruce+springsteen/born+in+the+u+s+a_20024969.html) during [campaign rallies](http://www.cnn.com/2012/08/16/politics/music-in-campaigns/index.html).

Correct me if I\'m wrong.\n\nUltimately, this is about what the average cinema goer, of a certain generation and disposition, in a certain time and place took away from the movie, and how Tyler\'s message resonated in much the same way that Irvine Welshes novel Trainspotting, "Choose Life.  Choose a career.  Choose a family.  Choose a big fucking television" made Generation X sit up and question the validity of the Baby Boomers "Greed is Good" mantra. \n\nGetting caught up on whether the underlying narrative (which is really just a love story according to Chuck) was misinterpreted due to undue emphasis being placed on Tyler\'s polemic, is largely a pointless exercise in intellectualism - we are chiefly concerned with the effect Tyler\'s message had on a generation of young adults - not whether that Generation viewed the overriding narrative through the lens of Nietzschean philosophy (they didn\'t).  What got Gen X excited was not the lead finally getting the girl and settling down (why would it when they were barely out of college?), but the idea of civil disobedience, overthrowing the ruling establishment and, above all else, finding purpose in a world beyond material wealth and mass produced entertainment.\n\nThe average Gen X viewer left that cinema with the Pixies still ringing in their ears and the many truisms of Tyler - "the things you own end up owning you." - taking hold in their subconscious and never quite letting go.  And those young idealistic computer geeks?  They left feeling they had a job to do.\n\nWhether that Generation have now calmed down a bit and are able to take solace in the finer existential nuances posed by the literature, or whether the 2008 banking crisis has re-kindled their rebellious Gen X urges (I\'m looking at you Russell Brand) is another discussion entirely.  But thanks for getting me chewing on these ideas. \n\n*"God damn it, an entire generation pumping gas, waiting tables \xe2\x80\x93 slaves with white collars.

Whilst no buildings actually fell at their hands in the physical world, plenty of empires are feeling the chaotic tremors: The Jolly Roger\'s Cookbook, Silkroad, Anonymous, Megaupload, the Piratebay, Wikileaks, Napster, Dark Wallet, Bittorrent and Bitcoin itself - these are all initiatives and movements Tyler himself would have no doubt drafted into the Project Mayhem internet manifesto.\n\nWith respect, to say I have missed the point by not mentioning the will to power, slave/master morality or ascent to the Overman *is* to miss the point.

Palahniuk says of the sequel: "Nowadays, Tyler is telling the story, lurking inside Jack, and ready to launch a comeback. Jack is oblivious. Marla is bored. Their marriage has run aground on the rocky coastline of middle-aged suburban boredom. It\'s only when their little boy disappears, kidnapped by Tyler, that Jack is dragged back into the world of mayhem."\n\n': 1, "> reddit doesn't serve news, it just collects links to news, so really it is the online branches of newspapers mostly that deliver the news.\n\nbbs's and reddit type sites are neatly replacing the news as the place people go to first to learn what is going on in the world.

He is confused and enraged, so he responds to his environment by creating Tyler Durden, a Nietzschean \xc3\x9cbermensch, in his mind. While Tyler is who the narrator would want to be, he is not empathetic and does not help the narrator face decisions in his life "that are complicated and have moral and ethical implications." Fincher explained, "[Tyler] can deal with the concepts of our lives in an idealistic fashion, but it doesn\'t have anything to do with the compromises of real life as modern man knows it. Which is: You\'re not really necessary to a lot of what\'s going on.

Since resolution is important to you, start with the actual evidence on hand, not my (or anyone else\'s) offhand (and stated "approximately") conclusions of it.

Since we can never agree on exactly what time it is in a decentralized system, we cannot directly agree on when it's been 10 minutes since the last block.\n\nThe solution is proof of work, the consensus algorithm that runs the network. Instead of depending on time, we depend on an amount of work that must be performed before we can accept a block. The work performed is a function of time * effort. Where effort is expressed as calculations performed by miners (SHA256 hashes specifically) and time is calculated as the amount of effort the network performs in about 10 minutes.\n\nThis is what miners do.\n\nSo instead of agreeing on what time it is, we agree on the amount of work to perform which will loosely take 10 minutes to complete.\n\nOn time itself, we have a very accepting concept, called the network adjusted time. This is the average time of your own clock, and the clock of all peers you're connected to (which they may be lying about). If this deviates from your own clock for more than 4 hours or so, something's up and you disconnect from those peers. Every block must be within 2 or so hours from the network adjusted time, otherwise it will be rejected.\n\nThe block time is later used to adjust the difficulty of the work that must be performed, every 2016 blocks.\n\nAnd that is how bitcoin reaches consensus about the ordering and timing of blocks.": 19, "No, because the honest node can provide recent blocks with timestamps that are protected by proof-of-work.

The other effect is we can print way more dollars than other countries can their currencies, since 2 out of 3 dollars are soaked up by other countries around the world to finance trade and to hold as reserves. This also means we can print as many as we feel like since we also export any inflation to other countries. So, in the end, other countries have to run sensible finances, and we don\'t, and other countries get screwed anyway since everything is dollar-denominated. When you win the Big War you get to make the terms, we\'ll probably have to wait until the next Big War (coming soon) before this system is reset.

Your balance reads $1000 but part of that $1000 is loaned to someone else as part of their mortgage, they pay interest payments on that which then get distributed back to you. Your $1000 is not locked, you can get it anytime you want and in most off the western world it is insured.\n\nThe financial crisis happened because they gave loans to people who were not suitable, defaulted and tipped the whole equation out of order, not because fractional reserve is fundamentally flawed.\n\n': 4, ">Sounds like a scam.
