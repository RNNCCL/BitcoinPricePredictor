It's even possible to make gains with Bitcoin, but this takes expertise and timing etc. Most people will pay fees to both send and acquire bitcoin because that's most expedient. An example of receiving Bitcoin with zero fees is working or selling something for bitcoin, since all you need is a free wallet. The network will also process transactions with no fees, but this isn't guaranteed and it can take a long time. A transaction fee is like a tip for better service.\n\n**Step 4:** Verify bitcoin. The wallet you use will verify you have received genuine bitcoins, but choose your wallet carefully.\n\n**Step 5:** Use Bitcoin privately.

Merely increasing the fee above that fixed level was enough to make the backlog immaterial.  There was no need for smart predictors or fee tweaking tools. \n\nThat is quite different from Mike\'s predicted scenario, when the *normal* traffic T temporarily exceeds the capacity C.  Or when a hostile entity launches a "spam attack" with the intent to disrupt normal processing.  In both cases, the excess traffic too will be paying increasingly large fees, so the typical client would be required to choose a fee higher than what a typical client would choose.  \n\nAFAIK there has been no comprhensive evaluation of the impact of the recent "stress tests" on normal transactions.

I think that it will be almost inevitable that the LN at some point will resort to fractional banking, when increasingly large fraction of the IOUs being exchanged have no backing BTC, but only someone\'s promise to provide the BTC "eventually".  After that, the next step will be to abandon the BTC backing altogether, so that the value of one "Lightningcoin"  will be decoupled from that of one bitcoin.  \n\nThis is what happened to the dollar and other national paper currencies in the last 100 years.

Being permissionless, IMO, is definitely higher than both of these goals, but to say that "growing is not a goal of bitcoin" is either dishonest, or applying sheer dev-elitism over people who actually hold and use bitcoins.': 1, '> A normal transaction is 250 bytes\n\nThe average transaction recently has been about 550 bytes.  That is a more meanigful number to use when estimating capacity and  traffic volume in bytes.\n\n> In the last few months there have been increasing runs of full blocks, causing backlogs for a few hours.  \n\nFull blocks do not cause backlogs, quite the opposite.  It is *empty* blocks (or, more generally, blocks that fail to include as many transactions as they could) that may create backlogs.  \n\nBut it is more correct to say that backlogs result when the total size of the transactions issued in the interval between two blocks exceeds the size of the next mined block.  \n\nA persistent backlog (a "traffic jam") results when this condition lasts over several consecutive blocks; that is, when the input traffic T (transaction bytes issued per second) exceeds the effective network capacity C (bytes added to the blockchain per second) when both are averaged over several tens of minutes.  \n\n> From the bitcoin users perspective, blocks should be infinite\n\nRather: for bitcoin to be minimally usable, backlogs must be rare and must clear quickly, so that the average wait time W for 1-confirmation remains 10 minutes, with exponential distribution.  This is still too long when compared to centralized systems, but it is the best one can hope for with the basic protocol design and parameters.  (Once a transaction got 1 confirmation, the average time for each additional confirmation is 10 minutes, independently of the incoming traffic, block size, or other queue policy details.)\n\nOnce a backlog forms, the average time  W for 1-confirmation explodes.  Its value will depend on how the difference T - C evolves in the future.  The backlog will continue growing while T > C, at the rate T- C, and will start to decrease only when T < C, at the rate C - T.   Even small percentual variations in T will result in large percentual variations in T - C, and may even change T - C from positive to negative.  For this reason, when there is a backlog the average wait time W is quite unpredictable, even by reference to previosus traffic jams.  \n\nMoreover, the average wait time W will not depend on the order in which transactions are processed by miners; it depends only on the amount T of transaction bytes that clients issue per second and the amount C that they process per second.  In particular, the average wait W is not significantly affected by the fees that clients choose to pay, or by their use of fee-tweaking tools like RBF or CPFP.   Fees can only change the order in which transactions are processed; but every time that a transaction jumps the queue to get into some future block, some other transaction will be pushed out from it to some later block.  (The only effect that higher fees can have on W is by encouraging miners to output larger blocks than they would with minimal fees.  This should be discussed in more detail.)\n\nTherefore, as in any other kind of network (roads, sewers, telephones, cash registers, ...) over-saturation of the bitcoin network must be avoided at all costs.  A network with T > C, even if only during peak hours, is a broken network.  A network administrator who lets that happen by negligence of bad judgement is an incompetetnt administrator.  Someonw who *wants* to see that happen is an attacker, and should not be allowed to work on the network.\n\nThe design and implementation of the bitcoin protocol always assumed that the network would operate well below saturation, so that *every* transaction issued would be included in the next block, except for propagation and other accidental delays.  In that regime, the transaction fee will have no effect on the waiting time *of individual transactions* as well as on the overall average wait W.\n\nIn order keep T almost always below C, **it is not necessary to have infinite C**: it suffices to have C somewhat larger than the peaks of T, so that the probability of T exceeding C for more than a few minutes is very small.  That also ensures that any eventual backlog, that may appear after an exceptional surge in T, will be quickly cleared once T returns to the normal level.\n\n>  From the bitcoin users perspective, fees should be zero or minimal.\n\nClients may *like* zero or insignificant fees, but this wish is nowhere as important as having small and predictable wait time W.  Avoiding saturation is essential. Subsidizing the service for banal uses is not.\n\nIndeed, one way to keep T well below C is to reduce T by raising the minimum fee.  A fee of 15-25 US cents per transaction (still considerably less than the true cost of the network) would probably cut 70-90% of the traffic T.\n\n(This option is absolutely *not* equivalent to limiting C and letting a "fee market" to develop.  Indeed it is a way to *avoid* this situation, which would be disatrous for bitcoin, as explained above.  Any mechanism for this purpose must discourage clients to use the network, not penalize them after they have chosen to use it.)\n\nEDIT: W depends only on T --> depends only on T and C\n\n': -1, '> If you do a survey of a random sample of bitcoin holders, I guarantee you that growing the userbase to eventually encompass significant swaths of the economy (some can wait longer than others) is the goal\n\nDifferent sets of people have different goals for bitcoin.  As you say, the early investors -- who have decided that the goal of bitcoin is to make them millionaries -- want its user base to expand by a factor of 1000 or more (but it must be bitcoin, not any other cryptocurrency).  Anarcho-capitalists, who have decided that the goal of bitcoin is to destroy the state, are more ambitious, but more flexible -- they want *some cryptocurrency* to completely replace national currencies.  And so on.\n\nOne may take the views that none of those opinions is more "legitimate" than any other.  One may say that the miners are only segment whose opinion matters, because they have more power to impose it on the other segments than the otther way around.  Or the other way around.  Whatever.\n\nHowever, bitcoin was *designed* for one specific goal, stated in the whitepaper.  All its parameters and features where chosen to fit *that* goal, not the goals of those groupls who appropriated it for other purposes.  For example, if the goal had been to provide a stable store of value, a lower block rate (say, 1 every 6 hours) woudl have been adequate, and would have simplified many things.    \n\nSo, if the developers were really committed to the care of Satoshi\'s experiment,  they should not pay attention to the wishes of speculators and VC investors.  Even because the "bitcoin of the holders" is a giant pyramid scheme, that has already transferred a billion dollars or more from the pockets of unwary investors (with considerable harm to some of them) to those of swindlers, scammers, and thieves.  The sooner that pyramid collapses, the better.': 0, "Should have made it clear it's from Rusty.

(4) Bitcoin needs users, lots of them, for its political survival. [ ... ] Jeff Garzik believes that (5) the bitcoin userbase has been promised that transactions will continue to be almost free.\n\nThose may be Mike's and Jeff's arguments, but it is not necessary to to believe any of them to conclude that the block size must be increased.  It suffices to note the fact that the traffic T (in daily or weekly average), *is* growing, and is already too close to the effective network capacity C.  Moreover, the clearance C - T is so small that a 200 MB backlog can be created by anyone willing to spend 5000 USD, and will take a week to clear, with unmeasured but significant inconvenience to normal clients. \n\n***Independently of ones's idea of what bitcoin should be, the project will fail if T gets so close to C that traffic jams become a recurrent feature.  Not because traffic jams will force clients to pay higher fees, but because the wait times will shoot up, and become unpredictable.

Its goal does not *require* the user base to grow.  Rather, the designer assumed -- or, rather, hoped -- that there would be no artificial barriers to its use; i.e. that the network capacity would be sufficient to accomodate the natural demand for its intended use, whatever that demand would be.

However, the block reward is *fixed*, regardless of the value of BTC; thus, as the value of BTC increases, the only way a miner can benefit in terms of compensation per block is through the block reward.\n\n    Yet, the block reward is diminishing geometrically; therefore, a rising value for BTC has a geometrically decreasing benefit to miners, and is therefore not a long-term solution as an incentive to make blocks.\n\n    Put another way, to depend on a rising value for BTC as a means of compensating miners is to depend on a block reward; hence, one way to make sure miners are suitably compensated is always to have a block reward, thereby breaking the 21&nbsp;million BTC cap.': 1, "> Large blocks take longer to propagate, increasing the rate of orphans.

And, as stated in the post above: "With regard to the Lightning Network, such an overlay (or something like it) is the *only* way that Bitcoin can scale, and Bitcoin must be scaled in order to be self-sustaining; the volume of transactions must grow tremendously in order for Bitcoin usage to be both cheap and secure."\n\nAt the other end of the link, it is pointed out that as the block reward decreases, the mining industry as it currently exists can only be sustained if at least one of the following statements is true:\n\n1. The price of BTC increases significantly.\n\n2. The average transaction fee increases significantly.\n\n3. The number of transactions of an average nature increases significantly.\n\n4. The block reward is not decreased so much, or never goes away; that is, the 21&nbsp;million&nbsp;BTC cap is broken.\n\nIt is observed that `2.` (increased fees) is out of the question, leaving `1.` (increased price), `3.` (increased transaction count), and `4.` (increased BTC supply). However, for `1.` to be useful in the long-term, it requires `4.`, and nobody likes `4.`, so that means they are both out of the question, leaving only `3.` (increased transaction count).\n\nUnfortunately, increasing the block size does not scale transaction count adequately. Hence, the need for an overlay that consolidates very many cheap transactions into expensive settlement transactions.\n\nSo, great, let\'s hard fork to a Bitcoin block size that is large enough to be useful, but not so large as to be stupid. Unfortunately, a hard fork is bad precedent, is not suitable as a general solution for improving Bitcoin, might possibly be avoided via more sophisticated mechanisms that only put at risk the capital of those who are willing to experiment, alters the hitherto successful rules of consensus, and would therefore force everyone to adopt and untested system; at the very least, a more universally agreed solution should be developed before even considering the institution of the philosophically repugnant hard fork.': -1, "> insure\n\nensure\n\n> Let's do this!\n\nYou've seen too many American blockbusters, where the day is saved by just wishing hard enough.": -1}, ('Who is responsible for cryptoinflation.com?

Most people have access to at least 5mbps (up) and many have 10mbps+ (especially mining pools).\n\nSo in reality, with 8MB blocks, even having just 5mbps of bandwidth would mean you\'re relaying blocks within about a minute and a half (as opposed to 30 seconds with 17mbps).\n\n5mbps upload is pretty standard at <$50/mo in the US.

This additional hours of delay *might* be acceptable for someone waiting for confirmation, which isn't expected to be fast anyway, but it has an importantly dangerous side effect: it becomes impossible to mine anonymously/decentralised; to have any hope of finding a block, miners now need to participate in some centralised miner backbone.

Average block size is ~450 KB.  1MB is more than enough unless you want more space for spam.': 1, 'I agree with you. \n\nThe infuriating thing about the debate is that on one hand you\'ve got the people who believe in larger blocks now, and are doing that with XT. It seems to me that XT\'ers are not absolutely closed to side chains or off-chain transactions. Later. They want bigger blocks now. I agree with XT\'ers, but I am not interested in running XT because... \n\nI\'m in the camp that is a marriage of an odd mating of A.) people who want 1MB blocks because they have a conflict of interest and are trying to set themselves up to \'save the day\' with LN, or B.) people who want any change in Bitcoin to be done with everyone in the party still in the party. The consensus people. They want bigger blocks but they don\'t want to support XT because they want Bitcoin Core for whatever reason to be the protocol they\'re using. \n\nI would probably consider myself in this camp though I wish that the \'bigger blocks\' people would stop splitting their conceptual \'vote\' between Core and XT when the division here between \'those who would keep bitcoin at 1MB so they can launch Lightning Networks immediately\' and \'bigger blocks ASAP\' is the more important distinction. \n\nThe latter two groups (i.e. people who want to use Core but want bigger blocks, vs. people who want Core to stay the same so they can use LN) fundamentally disagree and are arguing over the immediate future of Bitcoin Core. Therefore I think there is a false sense of alliance happening because more people are using Core than XT right now - the disagreement within Core is polarized whereas (I suspect the majority) users using Core likely spiritually agree with XT. For this reason (that I suspect most Core users and likely almost all XT users are in favour of bigger blocks) I wish the LN/1MB block people would go form a subreddit called /r/1MB-LN-Bitcoin and were treated like the forking alt-coiners with the rhetoric that is currently being applied to XT folks. But I digress again. \n\nNote: I\'m sure at the end of the proverbial day the small-blockers want bitcoin to succeed. They\'re all smart, their mothers love them, and I wish them all health and happiness. They want bitcoin to succeed, they \'bleed cypherpunk\' as someone said recently. OK, fine. I don\'t challenge that now. I don\'t think there are _no_ problems with going to bigger blocks. But we\'re not talking about 100GB blocks next year. Switching to something where Lightning Networks or other off-chain transactions are going on feels more like that\'s the alt-coin or fork-coin contingent of bitcoiners because the bigger block people are changing one variable that enables bitcoin to continue functioning the same, but with more people. When you start changing the ways in which our transactions are handled to something akin to LN, you change bitcoin. In my growing awareness of the technical details, it feels a bit, if you\'ll permit me being a bit glib, like LN is like injecting a bit of Ripple into bitcoin. That\'s not what most of us signed up for. It can happen later if we all think it should. It shouldn\'t get in the way of bitcoin\'s immediate term maturation. \n\nBut I digress. To summarize, I would like the "we should use Bitcoin Core; the block size should increase; consensus is important" people to get more together with the "XT is here now, forget you people, I fixed it" group. You both want bigger blocks. I wish those in favour of small blocks and LN would recognize that LN is fine; that something like that will likely be beneficial for a number of uses, but that we still need bigger blocks sooner, and to stop getting in the way of blocks getting bigger. \n\nThe sheer level of ad hominem being spewed about is embarrassing. There\'s so much noise and so little signal, including from people from whom I would expect a more civilized debate. I have fallen victim to my own frustrations too. A great number of people have a lot invested in bitcoin - emotionally and otherwise - and while from the adage "don\'t invest more than you can lose" is fun to bandy about, losing an investment (especially perhaps emotionally) is still shitty. It won\'t negatively impact my life if this project shits itself and collapses under its own rhetoric, financially, with respect to what I\'ve personally invested, but I would really hate to see that happen. \n\nTL;DR: We need bigger blocks. We need them soon. We\'ll probably use LN and/or things like it later, in conjunction with bigger blocks, but we shouldn\'t get in the way of a block size increase now just because we\'re holding out for LN. So much noise. Be kinder to each other.
