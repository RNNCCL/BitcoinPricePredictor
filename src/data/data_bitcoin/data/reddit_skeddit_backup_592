Bitcoind almost only *reads* from the drive, it *writes* very rarely to it. Writing 1 MB each 10 minutes is very very little and is well below what is expected that an SSD should be able to handle. The only thing that wears an SSD down over time is writing data to it, not reading data from it.[1]\n\nUsing an HDD however, would wear it down much faster because the moving parts inside it needs to move even if only reading data and not writing. With that said, I've still not seen any complaints from people using HDD's either, so I guess the reads are insignificant enough so that they don't wear down HDD's either.\n\n>> Will reading data cause SSD's to wear out?\n>> It's almost common knowledge that excessive writes (including formatting, defragmenting etc) will, in time, wear out solid state drives.

The limited write lifetime of Flash is a natural consequence of how they work.\n\n> Data on Flash drives is safe because the bits are stored by electrons locked in a very well isolated layer. These electrons, if present, produce an electric field that can be picked up by a nearby transistor. Since they're locked up, reading out the transistor doesn't affect the electrons. During writes, however, to get the electrons through that layer Flash needs very high voltages. These high voltages cause some damage to the isolation layer, which accrues.\n\n> In comparison, DRAM doesn't have such an isolation layer. The electrons move quite easily. As a result, DRAM is faster and doesn't break down from writes, but the leaked electrons frequently need to be replaced.
