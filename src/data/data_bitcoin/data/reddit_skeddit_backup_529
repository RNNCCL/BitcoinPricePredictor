I'm all for more projects, but it's hard to take this one seriously.": 1}, ('Model Law on Cryptocurrency', 4): {"It feels a bit like Easterbrook's law of the horse (reductio ad absurdum comparison to a special field of law just for the internet), but I guess something like this is worth thinking about since jurisdictions will inevitably want to pass laws. Having an alternate to the Bitlicense as a model could be helpful.\n\nA couple of points: \n\n* Your taxation provisions would probably cover every transaction for BTC, creating a gain/loss whenever you use btc to make a purchase. This is a huge, nigh unenforceable, hurdle. (If treated like a currency by the US IRS, only transactions resulting in a capital gain of $200 or more will result in a taxable event. See US federal tax code.) \n\n* Legal tender (afaik), only covers debts. Merchants are generally free to restrict forms of payment that they accept. I'm not sure if this has been tested in case law, but there are plenty of businesses that don't accept large bills. You should probably remove the provision at the end of Ch.2.\n\n": 1, "Yeah I know Bitcoin transfers cannot be regulated. \n\nBut you can regulate an exchange or a place where people store their bitcoins right? I mean if I've got BTC in digital wallet I'd like some security in knowing that if the operator of that wallet will not steal my BTC. That we can regulate. We can't regulate transfers but we can regulated intermediaries. \n\nWe can ensure that intermediaries can be trusted as they would be regulated by law. We can reduce the amount of bitcoin theft this way. \n\nThat's the same model used to regulate the internet. ": 1, "What prompted me to draft this model law was the bit license. Its clear that Governments want to regulate but they have no idea how to cause they don't understand bitcoin yet. Lets give them a model law that works for both so that we can get some stability. ": 1, "I know it feels like the law of the horse but the thing is crypto is spilling into the real world and I hope the model law would serve as a form of connecting link. Allowing for regulation wherever Bitcoin interacts with the physical world and allowing for a deregulated marketplace where the transactions are purely in the digital domain. \n\nIn Re the tax provisions I understand your worry, however, the model law only deals with how they are treated. i.e. Under the model law as applied to the US, BTC capital gains exceeding 200$ will be liable to tax as the tax code only taxes capital gains in excess of 200$. So by treating it as a capital gain we aren't mandatorily taxing it. It will be taxed as a capital gain in terms of the applicable tax legislation. \n\nI understand the worry in relation to legal tender but its specific to merchants operating from a physical location. I.e if I'm selling online it won't apply. But if I say set up a corner store in New York that only accepts bitcoin then the provision will apply and require me to accept USD at that store as well. The reason behind it is that as Bitcoin grows it shouldn't affect the manner in which consumers can access current services etc. Like I wouldn't want to be in a situation where I couldn't buy a pack of cigarettes cause I only have USD not Bitcoin. Its a complimentary position but I'm open to removing it if it seems problematic. :-). ": 1, '> But if I say set up a corner store in New York that only accepts bitcoin then the provision will apply and require me to accept USD at that store as well. \n\n[I understand the concern, but I personally don\'t view this as a problem. Reverse [tyranny of the market](http://www.amazon.com/The-Tyranny-Market-Cant-Always/dp/0674025814) of sorts: if there are enough consumers that want to spend USD, there will be merchants that accept USD (and/or a profitable opportunity for market entry). Merchants that accept only BTC will be severely limiting their consumer base, but it might make sense for certain industries (e.g., marijuana business that can\'t access banking).]\n\nIf you still want to accomplish your objective, I would suggest changing the words "A merchant" to "such merchant" (or merchants exclusively accepting cryptocurrencies) to specifically refer to merchants described in the preceding section. As it stands, the provision seems to apply to all merchants, whether or not they accept BTC.': 1, 'The regulation of Bitcoin even at exchanges will be pointless when 99% of the planet will not be getting there Bitcoins from this source.
