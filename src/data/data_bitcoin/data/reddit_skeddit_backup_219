They\'ve even done some early testing to prove that it works."\n\nThat *may* be true, but the remaining majority of civil engineers around the world remain in favour of a 10 ft span limit because it is clearly the safer of the two options.  And their first priority above all else is to ensure the safety of the public who will come to use the building.  It would be irresponsible to casually yield to the request for 80ft spans.\n\nThe twist in the comparison to Bitcoin is that we\'re actually pouring new floors onto this building, ad infinitum.

Interesting to think through tho.  Half baked thoughts below.\n\nTo start with, let\'s consider what happens if you just have a "lowest reward" wins.    That means nodes running code which accepts blocks with the smallest reward, and abandoning proof of work.  The whole point of proof of work is to stop attackers adding fraudulent blocks, as it is expensive to make a valid block(chain).  Now anyone could trivially make winning blocks, and the network would be very cheap to attack.  So unless I missed something, that\'s a non starter - right?\n\nBut what if you keep PoW, but then say, for example, each node waits for 10 valid blocks and accepts the one with the lowest reward (no idea if that is technically possible).  I haven\'t been able to think this all the way through, but it seems quite possible to me that rational miners will bid rewards down to approaching zero.  Certainly, the *repeated* selection of the lowest reward, from the distribution of ten, feels to me like it would cause a permanent (as in continuing forever) reduction in the winning reward.  \n\nThe amount miners rationally spend on mining will ultimately be equal to the value of the rewards.  So if this approaches zero, then the spending on mining will too - and you end up with zero security (forgetting transaction fees).\n\nMy feeling is that any competition based on lowness of reward may have these properties of continually reducing the actual reward.\n\nYou could argue that transaction fees are enough (one day they will have to be).  Looking more historically, I think that the reason for the block reward is really bootstrapping the system.  Bitcoins have value if the network works for transactions, and transactions only work if people mine, and people only mine if they get rewards.  The block reward pushes forward that value to the miners who get it off the ground, so that transactions can happen.\n\nFinally, I\'m not sure I agree that the halving lacks freedom.  You need some incentive structure for the bootstrapping.  To my mind, the market has freedom in how it reacts to and equilibrates around that structure  - though it\'s actual design (halving every 4 years) is somewhat arbitrary.  The fact is you need some (arbitrary) bootstrap structure - it just has to be openly known.  For example, just because the rewards are stepped, we should not expect significantly stepped hashing power - as the market foresees and anticipates the stepping, and should smooth mining investment accordingly.  No miner will wake up the day after halvening and think - right, now to work out how much I should invest now that rewards have halved.\n\nOne last thought, I\'m not aware any of the thousands of alt-coins who\'ve experimented with different reward formulas have had better success than bitcoin in this respect (though I don\'t know if your formula has actually been tried).': 1, "Would that result in consensus? Could one part of the network accept the miner's offer and then another part reject it? Remember the bitcoin network needs to come to a consensus on the history of all transactions.": 1, '1. Pursue of "lowest reward" is naturally not an option since miner must consider three factors: time to respond, complexity of PoW and his asking price when competing to win. All three determine your outcome, not one in isolation. Cheapest doesn\'t guarantee anything if somebody else matches your price with just a slightly higher complexity, he wins and you just wasted money (it\'s a setback not to win, which naturally pushes you to try harder next time or you\'re out of the game). As a miner then, I must balance my response time (to be even considered in the race), getting high enough complexity into my proofs and request a "reasonable price" in case another dude shows up with a similar quality proofs but at a cheaper price (his ASIC may be better than mine, etc).\n\n2. "The amount miners rationally spend on mining will ultimately be equal to the value of the rewards". Yes, and more generally the amount miners rationally spend on mining should be dictated by optimizing the probability of winning. The optimization must balance trade offs of response time, PoW complexity and cost to run the proofs.\n\n3. I strongly believe that transaction fees are not the way to solve this long term. Uncapping bitcoin finite supply is, but in a very careful, well thought out manner, not to let the inflation go wild. Tying the BT supply to the underlying cost of computing power, computing abilities and security needs sounds not so bad to me.\n\n4. "You need some incentive structure for the bootstrapping". Perhaps a while back yes, but given present market opportunities in BT space the "incentive" argument is probably not an issue anymore.': 1, 'Miners collectively controlling the money supply sounds like it will result in inflation forever. You write "no transaction fees anymore" but mining can never be free. Your proposal just shifts the costs of mining from transactors to investors.': 2, '> Would that result in consensus?\n\nIn the first stage, the network accepts quotes.

Each miner is connecting to many other peers that are sending them new blocks (and new transactions). Very similar to BitTorrent--it\'s peer-to-peer. The miner looks at it and checks that it\'s valid according to all the rules, and that all the transactions within are valid. If it passes, it\'s added to the miner\'s current chain. Note that each new block contains a reference to the previous block by encapsulating a hash of it. In this way blocks are "chained" together, hence blockchain.\n\nThe bitcoin protocol is designed that a valid block will only be generated every 10 min, on average, so all the nodes/miners will be in sync and have the same chain. Sometimes 2 valid blocks will be generated at the same time, in which case some miners will have one and some will have the other, resulting in 2 valid chains.

After coins are created, the only thing they can do is move to new addresses.  So the total amount doesn\'t change except for that first transaction each time.\n\n> Where are the records kept to control the bitcoins?\n\nThe record is the blockchain.  It\'s a history of every bitcoin transaction, ever.  Control resides in the private keys that individuals keep secret.  You need that key to make a new transaction moving coins to a new address.\n\n> What keeps bitcoins from going over the limit or duplicate bitcoins?\n\n5400 network nodes, all enforcing "the rules" contained in the bitcoin software.  If a miner attempts to include an incorrect number of new coins in their block, the block gets rejected by everyone.  Every bitcoin, or fraction thereof, has a history that can be traced by looking at the blockchain, which each node keeps a copy of.  \n\nA transaction that attempts to "double spend" a coin will fail.  The first transaction to arrive moves that coin to a new address.  The second one will be invalid because the sending address no longer has the coin to send.

No, I was not awarded the prize -- I was not expecting to. The committee has invited me to nominate someone for the 2016 Prize. I feel honored. Frankly, this is as close as I am going to get to the Nobel Prize. The names of a few deserving candidates quickly flashed through my mind. The names that most people in the Economics profession would agree with, Paul Romer who is at NYU, Doug Diamond at the University of Chicago, Steve Ross at MIT -- the usual suspects -- for their influential work in 1970s and \'80s. In all likelihood, they will receive the highly coveted prize sooner or later.\n\n&gt;I then started thinking whose ideas are likely to have a disruptive influence in the twenty first century. The name of the inventor of Bitcoin suddenly jumped up in my consciousness and I have not been able to get it out of my mind since then, Satoshi Nakamoto.\n\n&gt;Who is Satoshi Nakamoto? We don\'t really know.\n\n&gt;Where does he work and which country does he live in? We don\'t know.\n\n&gt;Which scholarly journals in the field of Economics or Finance has he published his research in? Not in any of the reputed journals that one would look for -- American Economic Review, Journal of Political Economy, Journal of Finance, Econometrica.\n\n&gt;Has he published anything?

They are refering to this idea that Bitcoin is primarily a network and the information it moves can be used for many different things that possibly we haven\'t imagined yet.\n\nPeople like to use the early Internet example for Bitcoin so let\'s go with that. Now, when stuff like TCP/IP was invented they never envisioned someone would use it to send memes about how their football team just clobbered another one. They were just concentrated on making sure the basic foundation was always working.  The protocol let\'s others play on top without you needing to explicitly detail every single thing that they can and can\'t do, some general rules exist and certain stability is established and people can go wild and design all sorts of stuff.\n\nWhat would happen though if tomorrow someone wanted to do a basic change of how one of these protocols operated, well if it\'s sudden some stuff might not work at all. Changes at this level are very sensitive since so many people start building on top.  Once you consider how important it is for those that are building on top of you for the protocol to be stable and secure then you start thinking about just what exactly are the things that can go wrong which would break the services that people can build on top of it. What\'s cumbersome? What\'s adding fat to it? How can it be attacked ? \n\n\nThe devs are doing that,  building the first layers of something  that most of us can\'t really imagine how far it can go.  Now since Bitcoin to top it off is not just any invention, but a fundamentally subversive concept, things that were already normal considerations like stability and safety now become paramount because not only normal people will try to break it, people more powerful might try to. Hell, one of the reasons people like /u/PeterTodd is so valuable even if many hate him is because he has the uncanny ability to be able to think like an attacker.  Let\'s keep in mind that this is something that transmits value and can affect people\'s well being if you use it in certain ways.\n\nMany other things can come to one\'s mind once you consider that it\'s not the first layer\'s priority or objective to provide many concrete features or services, the priority is stability and security; it needs to "always work".   So if you already are thinking about how you can protect the protocol then it\'s only natural that whenever someone wants to change it then feathers will be ruffled. The blocksize debate got heated partly because of this, the blockchain is the heart of Bitcoin and changing it is not as easy as flipping a switch.  Again this is where it always gets tough with Bitcoin. The whole system works based on utilizing a miner\'s greed so that they secure the network. So any change has to also consider Game Theory. If things aren\'t carefully calibrated then those who secure our network can either leave or do attacks themselves.\n\nThing is, this fundamentally goes against what the white paper originally envisioned for Bitcoin.

I am still neutral though, in the sense that all I care about is Bitcoin keeping its soul and moving forward on the basis of truth and technical merit, as well as practical realities.\n\nI mean, I had previously discarded the idea that a fork would be practical because I hadn't imagined it could survive. Thus, I behaved with the idea that current Bitcoin is the only possible answer, and so the community must work together and do its best to come to a compromise, no matter what. Even if the compromise was less than perfect, there was no viable alternative.\n\nAfter your comment though, I thought about it again and realized that maybe it's possible it could indeed not only survive, but thrive in the event of a fork (due to supermajority of technical talent, lots of miner sympathy towards Core --> and due to all this, possibly even leverage over existing VCs and rest of ecosystem, in the sense that if so many devs and miners coordinate and threaten to leave and present a credible plan for doing so, then existing system will be forced to have a better attitude and negotiate). If it's possible the end result is that 'new' Bitcoin is valued by the market with a m-cap of at least $1 billion (if we say that represents a decent size), then I'd define that as success.\n\nI think if it's to be considered though, there would have to be a lot of research and preparation done beforehand that can ultimately create some sort of white paper summarizing the plan (to answer all the questions in my post, as well as whatever else, including: how bootstrapping of network will work, whether and how to change protocol fundamentally -- whether to change all crypto to be quantum resistant, whether to introduce segregated witness and other new tech -- do we care for backwards compatibility with existing infrastructure, etc. etc.), consultation with all major Bitcoin-related entities (including whales like Winklevii, miners, businesses, 21, VCs, thought leaders, etc.) and some sort of process to incorporate everyone's feedback into a revised white paper plan.\n\nThis also includes planning to figure out a way for everyone in the new project to communicate efficiently, in a private / secure / trustless manner (some sort of sybil-resistant, decentralized-Reddit might be best) -- so no more normal Reddit, Twitter, Mailing list, normal emails, etc. Secure communication would have to be foundational, due to the 'new Bitcoin' project's nature and due to the desire to avoid the problems encountered in the first iteration (vulnerability to community pressure / interference / libel - from r/bitcoinxt, Hearn, etc.).\n\nIn other words, only if all aspects can be taken care of, and a viable plan that results in a thriving 'new Bitcoin' can be implemented, do I think it's a good idea to move in that direction. If it will just end up becoming a $10 (or even $50 or $100) million market cap altcoin, then I would still say it's a pointless exercise, because that means it may lack critical mass of network effect that is needed for security and other reasons.\n\n---\n\nLet me also add one more thing! If this 'fork' succeeds (and stays true to itself), then one could imagine that Satoshi makes some move to further legitimize the fork and de-legitimize 'old Bitcoin'. This may be something as drastic as sending his 1 million coins to exchanges to liquidate them (thereby crashing the price of 'old Bitcoin') and using the resulting funds to acquire 'new Bitcoin' (thereby bootstrapping its value).\n\n---\n\np.s.

If you could distill everything that has happened, then it aligns with this.\n\nAssume it\'s correct. Then, is it even possible to get the latter version of Bitcoin in a form that achieves a critical mass (not relegated to \'alt\' style market cap of $5-15 million, maintains security a la hashpower, etc. of current Bitcoin), if we assume \'Bitcoin\' is forced into the former?\n\nIf it\'s possible, then maybe all these issues can be solved very easily. A separate project, which is composed of the huge mass of developers currently working on Bitcoin to help it be what it should be (latter vision), would have more than enough technical talent to sustain itself. The question is only if it could attract mining hashrate, businesses (interested in the real vision -- e.g. wallet providers, exchanges, processors, Blockstream, etc.), etc. to help sustain it. Another question: how to solve issue of distribution, to make it fair and market-based (maybe clone existing blockchain\'s distribution?).\n\nI feel like it *could* be possible, if you consider how Ethereum has managed to get a $75 million market cap, despite being a new project. And imagine if "new Bitcoin" had 90% of the technical talent of Bitcoin, then it would have even more credibility than \'old\' Bitcoin. Not to mention, we don\'t even have to discard the name "Bitcoin" (we have r/bitcoin, bitcoin.org, etc.). In other words, some of \'old Bitcoin\'s\' network effect could automatically be siphoned into \'new Bitcoin\' (weakening old, strengthening new -- helping with bootstrap process). There are also lots of improvements (e.g. segregated witness from elements alpha) that could be incorporated from the start into \'new Bitcoin\', which would make it superior to \'old Bitcoin\'. Also, if it was seen by onlookers that \'new Bitcoin\' has much better technical talent than \'old Bitcoin\' and is superior in every way (privacy, tech, scalability, decentralization, censorship resistant, etc.), then I could even imagine lots of capital and investment flow into it... since it would have "credibility" and "trust", which perhaps are the only things that really matter (differentiates bitcoin vs. altcoins, and ethereum vs. altcoins).\n\nIt would be nice not to have to deal with the enormous quantity of idiots in r/bitcoinxt and elsewhere who have basically been brainwashed at this point (not even joking, see their comments and how they talk in r/btc\'s thread on blockstream -- https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/ comments/3s3u8x/our_blockstream_saviours_and_xt_infidels/cwu8o6i). If we don\'t have to waste time with all of that, since it would be a separate project fork, then life would be much more happy and work would be done more efficiently (purely dictated by technicals, not politics).\n\nThoughts?\n\nThe more I think about it, the more I wonder if this truly is the best solution... not just practical and viable, but truly a great solution to all our problems. All it needs to work is to be coherent, comprehensive, coordinated, and well-planned. After such a fork, we will never again have to deal with this kind of nonsense. We can make it clear from the get-go that \'new Bitcoin\' (latter vision) is going to be \'digital gold\', with all the qualities inherent to that (anonymity perhaps with Zerocash or Cryptonote, fungibility, security, decentralization of nodes and mining, node incentivization, layer 2 (LN) for instant confirmations & micropayments, etc.).': 6, 'Definitely more controversial and with higher impact than just changing an already existing setting for block sizes to a new value of function though.

The clever bit is this message is \'signed\' using your private key, what this means in practice is it adds another unique number to the transaction that can only be worked out if you know the private key number.  This way the network will only accept valid transactions and you can\'t spoof owning someone elses address.\n\n\nThe database analogy goes so far but in truth there\'s a little more to it as the db is actually closer to a database of receipts with challenges on each to allow you to forward the funds to someone else.

Is there a snowball chance in hell that your now old 2-4-8 proposal or something similar will get accepted by core?\n\n>I think that or something else will be adopted in a bit (after review, testing etc). Maybe a range of things in stages.\n\nThanks. That\'s encouraging.\n\nIn this panel discussion, I would have liked /u/nullc to have said a few more direct things to move this debate along. (I would have liked /u/bruce_fentor or /u/andreasma to prompt for these more hardball questions!)\n\nFor instance:\n\n- Admit that from the pure technical aspect of the bitcoin network, that if we were to move to 8 MB (or X MB) with core dev consensus, that the network would work just fine. The risks of an uncontroversial fork are low for maintaining functionality, even if we lose some nodes due to higher node cost. This admission wouldn\'t give up any ground on the decentralization stance, but would clarify the argument and move us past this FUD.\n\n- Admit that we are currently on a collision course with exponential organic usage growth and a hard cap. If nothing is done, there will be failure modes of some kind. /u/gavinandresen and /u/mike_hearn have articulated these carefully. By not acknowledging these failure modes it pins the discussion to endless rehash and we can\'t move on. Again, this doesn\'t give up any ground on the decentralization stance.\n\n- Admit that right now we\'re already seeing 4-5 full blocks in a row at times, so it\'s likely that some users are feeling the pain already (they tried to use the system in an appropriate way, and it failed for them). Bitcoin is highly resiliant, so it will cope with this pretty well, for a while--maybe 3 months?\n\n- Clarify in specific terms how far "into the wall" the core devs, /u/nullc in particular, intend to take us. There has been some written about desiring a fee market, in order to create incentive for layer2 solutions. This might be very tricky to manage. A reasonable observer looking at this can conclude that the core devs are playing with fire. I\'d like to know what their intent is. If 0.0002 ($0.07) transactions won\'t work anymore reliably for a typical user (say), how about 50 cent? $1? What is the core dev thinking on specifically how much fee pressure is reasonable.\n\n- With the analogy to IETF mentioned in this debate, I would have liked to ask: this situation is different than say Ethernet vs. Infiniband, in that we have proponents of Infiniband sitting on and in fact dominating the committee that decides the rules for Ethernet. We have the wrong dynamics for a true competition between technical directions. If layer2 solutions could thrive in a "fair" playing field where bitcoin core isn\'t handicapped, then I think everybody would be wildly supportive.\n': 1, "Requirements from a business perspective are good to know of course and we could do with more companies articulating what their thoughts are, so I am pleased Brian - often they seem to keep their thoughts private or talk to one or two people in private only.  In FOSS it's hard to, and perhaps even undesirable, to handle non-public feedback and requirements.\n\nAt Scaling Bitcoin 1 in Montreal, Charlie Lee (coinbase CTO) attended.  Maybe Brian would like to have coinbase co-sponsor the conference, along with the other 40 companies sponsoring, and perhaps also to present BIP-101 if Gavin is unable to come, or have Charlie do it if he agrees.  It's probably better to be involved in the technical conversation and BIP evaluation.\n\nPersonally I look forward to seeing the BIP proposals that are presented.  I would estimate it's going to roll until early 2016 just for safety reasons - it takes coordination and testing and time to activate soft-forks, and I am presuming something similar will be true for hard-forks.  I believe people have said if there is clear agreement, a hard-fork could happen faster, so that could be good for a basic scaling proposal.  We maybe faced with a choice of a basic proposal or a better long term proposal (that are both implemented and ready to go from a core tech perspective).  Hard to prejudge that without seeing what the better long term proposal offers specifically.": 2, "Crypto is competitive from the point of serving users.

Hypothetically, if there are only 2 users on the network who are transferring tens of billions of dollars worth of value on-chain per day, and paying miners for that privilege, Bitcoin is much more likely to survive than if millions of users are using bitcoin to play Satoshi Dice and paying de-minimus fees.\n": 1, "I was impressed by Andreas' (/u/andreasma) ability to effortlessly and quickly summarize the essence of three very long and content rich audience questions.

Is 21600 bytes enough today?', 3): {"Ok, I'll try an ELI5:\n\nIBLT is a data structure used to encode bitcoin blocks. Its main feature is that it's fixed size. You put all the transactions in a block into the IBLT (which remains the same size, eg 21600 bytes), The transactions are overlayed on top of each other in the IBLT. Then the IBLT is transferred to another peer P. P will then guess what transactions are in the block and remove all the guesses from the IBLT. What's left in the IBLT are the guesses that were wrong (identified by a minus sign) and the transactions that P didn't guess (identified by a plus sign). This will only work if the IBLT is big enough to hold all the bad guesses. If we use an IBLT of size 21600 bytes we can transfer about 95% of all blocks in today's network. For details on how the IBLT works check out my infographic on the subject: http://popeller.io/index.php/2015/10/09/bitcoin-block-propagation-with-iblt-infographic/": 2, "The gist of IBLT is that, since transactions propagate through the network during the window between finding blocks, you don't need all nodes to send the entire batch of transactions when a block is found because they'll have data on the majority of transactions already. All you need is enough information to figure out which transactions are in the new block and then rebuild that block locally - similar to how parity works.\n\nThe testing shows that a tiny amount of data can be used to enable nodes to calculate the correct block 99% of the time - the data amount being about 20Kb. If even less data is used, the estimated error rate increased to 8%. Since not many nodes would encounter that 1-8% error rate at the same time, they would recover during the next time window before another block is generated. One method of recovery would be for the node to request the full block as the network currently operates.": 2, 'ELI5?': 1}, ('Why the Price of Bitcoin Does Matter', 1): {"What really matters is the fungibility of the currency, the price will take care of itself.
