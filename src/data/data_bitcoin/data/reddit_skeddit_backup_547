So for instance, this page: https://thepiratebay.se/torrent/11183060/The_Rise_and_Rise_of_Bitcoin_-_HD would have a meta tag, one for each seeder, and one for the original uploader. When a downloader lands on the download page, their autotip browser extension will send a small amount of bitcoin to all the seeders currently seeding the torrent. When a seeder drops out, their meta tag is removed from the page, and they no longer get tips from new downloaders. This way incentivises people to seed for a long time, but not necessarily to give a lot of bandwidth. Maybe the torrent website can experiment with the "data-ratio" value to correspond with how much bandwidth the peer is giving...': 2, 'Nope completely impossible.

That way, over time people would get the idea that if they left their client open it would collect money for them.  \n\nThere\'s plenty of legal uses for torrents and I can see this tipping mechanism really useful for free/Creative Commons/independent content that makes use of torrent for distribution.   Most of the replies on this thread are coming from the angle of people who mainly use torrents for illegal content, but if you haven\'t noticed recently that the company "BitTorrent" has been trying to market and position themselves as an alternative CDN provider aside from Akamai and all those others.  I remember they were trying to convince Sony to use them as a distribution platform for "the interview".   Think about it: If I\'m an indie movie producer I could post my film on BitTorrent and then take any money I would have spent on expensive fast hosting and spend a fraction of that tipping those nodes who seed.  With torrent clients implemented in JavaScript/WebRTC this could be a really attractive solution and low-cost barrier of entry for content producers, especially those that produce content requiring lots of bandwidth.    This would essentially be the decentralized CDN of the future.   \n\nNow add on lighthouse, decentralized bandcamp, and storaj-like features and you got yourself the next Netflix of the future.

We believe piracy isn't going anywhere, but it is mitigated when you give people convenient and legal options to get paid content.\n\nYou as a downloader could always create a new torrent that shares the file for free, but I believe you will have a bigger incentive of becoming a seeder of the legal torrent so that you can earn some money back by sharing.\n\n**Bitcoin might not be ready for the volume of transactions we might create though...**\n\nOne of our biggest concerns with this, after talking to Bitcoin developers, is that we think the Blockchain is not ready for the amount of transactions we could potentially bring, so maybe it'd be wise to wait until Bitcoin has a larger blocksize (like the 20MB tests they were doing) and can at least process 8000 transactions per minute, currently the Bitcoin blockchain can do only handle about 400 transactions per minute, given it has a mere 1mb sized block -> 1Mb/250 bytes per transaction = Max ~4000 transactions in ~10 minutes => ~400 tx/min, which is nothing, if Bitcoin were to be adopted today in all of NYC it would probably collapse every morning when people are buying coffee and breakfast, 400 tx per minute is nothing.\n\nWhat core developers will tell you at this point in time, is that if you have a high transaction volume, take it off the blockchain (centralize it basically), that's not something we could do in the case of Bittorrent transactions as Bittorrent is a distributed system and we wouldn't like to have anything to do as developers with the transactions people make on the network, meaning, we wouldn't host this transactions for anything in the world, it'd be too much liability as it is expected that some people will try to truly pirate content and sell stuff they have not created, not to mention the possibility of selling illegal files on the network. So, since we can't take our transactions off the blockchain anytime soon, we'll have to wait for Bitcoin to scale.\n\nSo... no rush to build this at the moment, we think it would only make Bitcoin collapse, and that wouldn't be good for anybody.\n\n\n\n(I'm a [Bittorrent developer](https://github.com/frostwire/frostwire-desktop/commits?author=gubatron), and have contributed a [few times](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commits?author=gubatron) to Bittorrent-Core)": 27, 'Well its all about demand.

For example, if one or a cluster of addresses that were created at a specific time sent somewhat regular (say once a day) amounts to new addresses being created just as regularly, you get a vertical line. One thing that would do that would be a published address like a donation address or static receiving address which is programmed to regularly send amounts to newly generated addresses.\n\nIf new addresses being created regularly (again, say once a day) were regularly sending bitcoin to the same address over time, you would get a horizontal line. This makes sense as the other side of the vertical line explanation above (there is a reason there is symmetry reflected across the diagonal).\n\nIf people only sent and received with new addresses, you get the diagonal (what OP pointed out is a lot of change addresses).\n\nDots in the top left corner would mean an address that showed up on the blockchain early on sent something to an address created more recently. Dots in the bottom right would mean an address created more recently sent something to an address that had been created early on.\n\nAs people then spend from their change addresses, they would be sending mostly to older addresses, so  you'd get a slight 'fanning out' to the right of the diagonal (which we can see here) which ought to expand more (due to more addresses overall being created) as we follow the diagonal (going forward in time, although not necessarily smoothly) which we also see.\n\nThe trend of being brighter as we go down from the diagonal, which isn't smooth but exists, could be just newer addresses sending to older ones, perhaps addresses for stores or donations (which I mentioned earlier).\n\nSo the slanted lines, what could they mean? Since diagonal means new addresses sending to new addresses (or just new receiving a lot) and horizontal would mean new addresses sending to an old (static) one, then a slight positive slope generally would mean addresses sending are being generated at a rate significantly higher than addresses receiving are being generated. One thing that could cause this would be the 'provably fair' gambling sites that rotate their receiving addresses over time but get a lot of new addresses sending to them. This possible explanation has been mentioned by a few others but I felt they didn't do a good job communicating why and I thought a more (long winded) analysis could help.\n\nA correction for the rate of addresses creation on the blockchain over time, and labeled, would be more intuitive for people and could show some interesting things.": 1, 'https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/2y55uc/plotted_13m_bitcoin_txns_found_some_interesting/cp6baud': 1, 'Didn\'t mean predictable per say.. more like "random within bounds"\n\nDifficult concept to communicate.

Your entire system will be protected from hackers, but it would be up to you to manually issue payments, such as refunds and the like. Even if your hardware wallet isn't notified of which address is being used by each transaction, it should still be able to find those transactions because it would eventually use those addresses anyway. Sound about right?\n\nHas anyone published an algorithm that generates only the safe addresses from a seed list? I feel like it can't be that difficult to build. All the payments would go straight into hw cold storage, never even temporarily sitting on your hosts. Your server would never hold anything but safe addresses.\n\nEDIT: I wonder if it could be coded up as a feature in the Ledger or Trezor -- generate a CSV of the next 100,000 Load addresses and transfer them to the host.Now you have keys for 100k transactions which, for a small business, would likely carry you for a lifetime. I could see there's a risk of a hacker changing the CSV. Maybe it sits on an SD card with the write protect switch thrown. Maybe, depending on your website setup, the CSV sits on a CIFS share that is mounted read only on your app tier and the read write option is password protected.

Just one more thing that I'd like to let you know (it's not big news like new exchanges around in the market, though haha). \n\nAbout the educational resources just have a look at our starting project called Bitcoin Hub which will have 20 free (as in free beer) events (discussion, debate, talks...) with teleconference for interested groups around the country. We also will go for some Bitcoin Square events (no exactly number right now) in Rio (at least... It's where we are based).
