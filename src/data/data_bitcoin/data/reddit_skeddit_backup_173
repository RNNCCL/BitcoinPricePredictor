As has been reported and show in our public documents such as meeting minutes, our board has had some disagreements in recent months and our organization has also faced it's fair share of ups and downs. It's key to have a board that works well together and is effective.\n\nIn today's meeting we discussed our funding and our future. I noted that it is important for us to move forward and that it is key to see where the members stand on the future of the organization.\n\nAfter some discussion on direction and planning, Board Chairman Brock Pierce called for a vote on whether we should continue the organization or dissolve it.\n\nBrock, Elizabeth Ploshay McCauley, Meyer Malka (via email vote) and I voted to continue support of the organization and to move forward.

Given the difference of opinion, I respectfully requested the resignation of Jim and Olivier so that the remaining board members are unified in a plan to stay and improve the organization. Jim agreed to resign and the board accepted. We wished him well in future endeavors. After some further discussion with Olivier, who indicated that he would support a plan but wanted to have a plan in place before supporting the organization, I made the motion that the board remove Olivier from his seat. This motion was seconded and voted affirmatively by me, Brock, Elizabeth and Meyer. We wish Olivier the best in the future and we appreciate the efforts by both Olivier and Jim.\n\nOne challenge in a large and diverse organization is that differences of opinion are more common. In some cases, this leads to more variety and higher quality decisions, in other cases members may have such different opinions that it can be counterproductive. The first priority should be to have a board that interacts effectively and efficiently. We all worked hard to make this particular board composition work and each of us has a different opinion about what could have worked better. No one is right or wrong, we simply have different ideas. At the end of the day, we all care about Bitcoin and want to help it in whatever way possible. Jim and Olivier served as volunteers and we appreciate their time and work. Aside from the foundation they have both done a great deal for Bitcoin and no doubt will continue to.\n\nDifferences of opinion are a part of any organization. In our case, our discussions are public and our minutes released, this offers more transparency but also brings any disagreements into the public eye.\n\nThe board and the Executive Director are all volunteers because we all share the belief that this organization should exist and can be a positive asset to Bitcoin. In recent months the ED has cut costs to a very minimal rate while our foundation also been able to add value to the ecosystem with events like DevCore, the launch of media and speaker engagement programs and other initiatives.\n\nThis foundation belongs to the members, the individuals, corporations and community as much as it belongs to we members of the board. We want to see this organization work and we are open to any volunteers and ideas on how to make the organization as beneficial as possible, provided those ideas come from a premise that the existence of the organization itself can be a positive force. In the past, we have convened some of the most successful meetings in the industry, funded core development, sponsored the bitnodes project, Bitcoin.org, grants and other initiatives. We have many dedicated volunteers such as the members of the Education, Regulatory and Election committees and our membership covers the entire globe with a roster that is far larger and more comprehensive than any other organization in Bitcoin. The board looks forward to moving ahead with a unified and positive vision.

Anyway, sometimes it doesn't always work out between people and I still wish you luck in developing the organisation as it now will be easier for the board to find compromises.  \n\nSome ideas I think could be a good way forward for the foundation in 2016:\n\n1. DevCore (corporate and preferably institutional sponsorship and grants can help lower the cost for the foundation, this is where the work goes into filing applications (and finding which to file) and cold calling which can be helped by community participation).\n\n2. Research into how to perform education and outreach effectively and eventually coming up with a better plan over time (maybe partner with a university or try to just establish some metrics informed  through community participation).\n\n3. Research how to create public budgets, plans and accounts and implement it for 2017 (again, crowd source ideas and ask the community or experts who know about these things for help).\n\n4.

Users would have to pay a micropayment per (x,y,z,t) query. The result of the same query would change with time, as the simulations update. I\'m looking forward to see what kind of surrogate model you will develop to compete with my simulations. Even if you had access, for free, to a record of all the previous simulation results that I sold, you wouldn\'t be able to reconstruct a surrogate model precise enough to predict a decent interpolation, which would be useless in that context as the users would most likely want an extrapolation of the previous outputs. \n\n> reveals how little you know about what you are talking about.\n\nSo yeah, I don\'t claim to be an expert in smart contracts or in Ethereum, and I\'m surely not the sharpest knife in the kitchen, but I\'m not going around saying everybody else is embarrassingly stupid, either. \n\nThat said I\'m looking forward to see how Augur and Hivemind will perform in comparison, and how you plan to bootstrap your not-an-app-coin-token.

At one point you say you demanded bitcoin core be used and your justifications implied risk of new tech. There is some truth to that, but the entire sector is risky and unknown and there are advantages to using other tech.\n\nUsing Ethereum (or Rootstock in future) allows decentralised app experiments extremely quickly. I and many others have built experiments in Ethereum in a matter or hours or days which just aren\'t feasible elsewhere, and those experiments then inform what we do next, including funding rounds (not just crowdfunded!). The technology isn\'t a fixed target, rather we have the tools we have now to prototype.\n\nI\'m intrigued as to what you feel they are both harmful and cannot work. I disagree with your condition 2 because it\'s too simplistic a view to use in general terms, although it does impact some specific projects to a greater or lesser degree. That said, I\'m prepared to change my mind because I have no particular buy in to any tech, it\'s just a means to an end.\n\nI agree with you to some extent about the \'investment thing\' but then anyone in this space surely knows by now what they\'re dealing with. It\'s like penny stocks. Ethereum is way, way past being marketed as a investment option and even at the time it barely was by -most- involved (Vitalik\'s vision was somewhat hijacked by certain individuals to make money). Some involved do think it will replace Bitcoin (not me), but so what if they do? There are Bitcoin idealists, Ethereum idealists, NXT idealists, etc. Augur is little different. People buy in to the idea as much as anything and this is still the wild west when it comes to such things - everyone knows that surely by now.\n\nEdit: Read the link you provided earlier with your explanation on why ethereum can\'t work. With regard to oracles I agree in general as I\'ve always had the same issue. My expectation was that they needed to provide value add in some way, where the oracle element is a side part and essentially free. Value add can be through an alarm call, off chain processing, etc. It\'d perhaps be commoditised but probably workable.\n\nHowever, you\'re making an assumption that there is no value in a particular contract running and this isn\'t true because you\'ve not considered the notion of \'value\'. Let\'s say an identity was on the blockchain somehow. The identity contract which supports the identity has to be supported by a) other contracts and/or b) client software. Choices have to be made which identity contracts to support. Cloned contracts may be technically identical and have no fees but they won\'t be used because the other software (on chain or off chain) has already decided what it will support.\n\n"The contract at address abcd1234 we know is run that software co X and we trust any changes they make will be valid (because we\'re probably talking contract frameworks here, not a single write once contract in many cases), therefore we directly support it\'s API in identity checks."\n\nCloned (parasitic) contracts have no value here, or at least they need to work their way up the chain to be trusted. Absolutely it\'ll happen but it\'s not mutually assured destruction at all, just like open source software isn\'t always free. There is value to brand and value to trust. Smart contracts are not as trust-less or brand-less and people believe.\n\n\n': 1, "Yes you did miss it. Because you are still focused on a constructing an argument using equity and favors as analogs to finite digital tokens. \n\nEquity is the value of shares in a company. Bitcoins are not equity in a company. They are finite digital tokens that allow users to participate in the network for storing and sending value. Appcoins/altcoins are finite digital tokens that allow users to participate in whatever function the app provides.\n\nFavors are something people do for somebody else out of kindness. When a person sends a bitcoin to another person they may be doing a person a favor (by giving them money) but they are more than likely just participating in a transaction - exchanging goods or services for that bitcoin.

For a full DAO I'm not convinced as the contracts can simply be copied without the complication; so what is the value add unless client apps, possibly regulators and users (public, private; enterprise) believe the DAO one to be of more value perhaps because of network effect and/or pr. For example, public licensing and ownership. I'm not saying bitcoin can't do this (ascribe use btc) but it doesn't do rule based enforcement or small but meaningful data at all well.

The reason you hold cash is because you know you can very easily get rid of it in exchange for whatever you need at any time. The interesting thing about that is the more that people want cash, the more objectively useful it is. This is what I mean by the network effect. If the network effect really is the explanation for the value of a currency, as I claim it is, then it becomes very difficult to imagine how two currencies could be in equilibrium with one another. Any trend which promoted the growth of one at the expense of the other would tend to reinforce itself: for the growth of the network inherently improves the usefulness of the currency, thus attracting more people to it regardless of the original reason that the growth took place.\n\nI think that altcoins are networks of people who talk a lot about issues that would be moot without answers to fundamental questions about the economics of their situation, which they have consistently been unable to provide. For example, a necessary prerequisite before I would invest in a currency other than Bitcoin would be an explanation as to how it will beat Bitcoin.

Even if you just print money and throw it out there you still have to record that entry and things still "balance out" one way or another. You can either end the obligation immediately or make some kind of debt jubilee later where the Fed says "lol we just forgave 1 trillion in debt and our equity took a hit, but who cares since we print USD". But yea, again, the risk here is in inflation sparking off in a crisis of confidence that would result. \n\nIt\'s an experiment the world has not yet really tried -- for such a dominant economy like the US with no gold standard or any peg that would hinder the external account to try flat out monetizing debt or printing money with a helicopter drop in a deflationary trap. Weimar happened because they were printing DM to pay gold while they had a peg. Zimbabwe happened because of their huge USD liabilities (effectively same risks as a peg). \n\nJapan has gotten close to doing this -- in fact some argue they already have (their debt/gdp ratio is over 200%, but their bond rates are still 0-1%), demonstrating partly how the risk is overblown about debt monetization and printing for monetary sovereigns (ie., not countries like Greece who dont have that control), AT LEAST WITHIN THIS CURRENT CONTEXT.
