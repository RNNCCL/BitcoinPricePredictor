Godspeed brother.': 1}, ('Coinbase', 3): {'I did as you did so here is a very detailed response:\n\nThe Bitcoin at any online exchange are not under your direct control. For example, if you want to fund online gambling by requesting a payment be made to an address that they somehow recognize as belonging to a gambling site (and I don\'t know how they would do so) they may not allow you to move the BTC.\n\nSo with the concern in mind that I might someday want to move my coins to another address and not be allowed to do so  (Already they do ask you if you are sending BTC to another person or to a company and if the later, they ask further questions.) I decided to diversify by moving some BTC to an address under my complete control.\n\nThe first step is to create an address. Not a wallet but an address. Associated with that address is a private key. You must keep the private key secret and never forget it while BTC remains at that address.\n\nI can tell you how I got the address and key but I think other posts have been made about this. So for now, let us assume you created the address and saved the private key securely.\n\n*The next step is extremely simple:* Your online wallet site will ask you for this public address which of course you can tell anyone without worrying about this and they will also ask for the amount of BTC you want to move.\n\nVery soon after this, you can look at the blockchain and see that these BTC have been moved from the address belonging to the site (which you had no reason to know about before, although I suppose they could tell you) and to the address that you created. That\'s it as far as getting the coins under your control.\n\nNote that the private key you were given has yet to be used. As you might have guessed, it only is used when you want to move those coins to *another* address which in fact you might want to do soon because not only is this a good experiment but it separates those coins further from the original site.\n\nSo say you decide to do so. You must create a second new address and save a new key for that address.\n\nThe first transfer from the site to the address required no software -- you were using the site\'s software to effect this first transfer but the next transfer requires a Bitcoin client such as the Electrum wallet.\n\nYou will tell this wallet what the address you want to transfer BTC to and the address where the BTC are. The wallet needs the first private key in order to do this.\n\nIt is my understanding that transferring less than all the coins at the address to another address is not secure -- the remaining coins may not be safe because you used the private key. I do not know if this is true.\n\nSo let us say we do the "safe" thing and use the key only once to move all the BTC to the second address. You can check the blockchain to see that the coins are no longer at the first address and now at the second address you created.\n\nThat is it until you want to move or spend the coins. Then you will use the second private key.\n\nNote that if you wanted to spend BTC at an address on a purchase smaller than those amount stored at that address, you would actually use the private key twice -- first for paying for the purchase and the second time (soon after for security\'s sake) for moving the remainder to a new address. Not sure why this is so necessary.\n\nLet me know if this helped or if I made a mistake.': 3, 'Download this\n\nhttps://bitcoinpaperwallet.com/\n\nthen turn off your computer, unplug the internet and only run that program, Print your keys, then turn off your computer, plug internet back in, and boot back up.
