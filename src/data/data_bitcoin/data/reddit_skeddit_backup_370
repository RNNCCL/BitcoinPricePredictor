": 1, 'It was on Facebook.': 2, "Altcoins are constantly subject to pump and dumps and more extreme volatility than bitcoin, which admittedly has high volatility itself. But with bitcoin, you're dealing with moving a 4.4 billion USD market, which is much tougher than moving or manipulating any particular 1-20 million USD altcoin market.\n\nAltcoins can only really be feasible if backed by bitcoin as the reserve currency, which is the purpose of sidechains. We already have 2-way federated peg sidechains, btw. The next step is more difficult, but we have a company (Blockstream) funded with 21 million USD devoted to bringing mature sidechains to market.\n\nIn my opinion, altcoins are just a ticking time bomb, with bitcoin set to subsume anything useful from them. People complain of bitcoin 'maximalism' or that bitcoiners just want to 'dominate' everything, and feel threatened. But really, it's just inevitable.\n\nFor example, Bitcoin is pseudonymous (between anonymous and transparent) which is actually enough for most people, but true anonymity is already possible in Bitcoin through: CoinJoin technology (which is being developed and made ever easier to use i.e. JoinMarket), and privacy is also being targeted via: 'Confidential Transactions' technology (https://people.xiph.org/~greg/confidential_values.txt). These developments are not even dependent on development of sidechains, but they alone will lay waste to any privacy-focused altcoins like Dash and cryptonote-based BCN or XMR. Even something as simple as off-chain Lightning transactions will offer true anonymity.\n\nThe point is, either by layer 1 direct improvements to the protocol or to wallet software, or by layer 2 improvements (off-chain trustless transactions, sidechains, etc.), it is inevitable that Bitcoin will dominate (and for good reason!! not dominate by force, but by bringing a superior experience).": 1, "It's difficult not to see consumption of resources as at least inefficient, just so far we don't have anything better.

This is not called "many others".\n\n> "The whole point is there is no counter party risk in that kind of asset while gaining all the advantages of cryptos."\n\nI don\'t think you understand what counterparty risk is; if bitGLD is tracking the gold ETF, GLD, then it\'s automatically subject to the counterparty risk that GLD itself is subject to. Ditto for bitUSD and USD.': 1, "Yes, incentives exist with the altcoin system since premining is possible and the market rate is free and can fluctuate (i.e. increase in value). I don't deny this. However, while this system is good for the creators of alts, it's a poor system for end users.\n\nOnce sidechains arrive, it will be trivial to clone an existing altcoin in its entirety, but instead have the market rate (price) of the altcoin pegged to bitcoin's rate. This means all of Bitcoin's existing superiority (more stable exchange rate due to large market cap, less cost due to tighter spreads due to high liquidity, compatibility with the already existing high development of Bitcoin ecosystem and services, and other benefits of Bitcoin's network effect) will be drawn upon by the sidechained altcoins.\n\nThis is obviously better for users, but not good for altcoin developers since their work will essentially be appropriated or devoured by Bitcoin. I'm not saying it is good or bad... it just 'is'. It will become the reality.\n\nAnd yes, altcoins are here and offer some utility, but without Bitcoin's network effect, they are doomed to remain tiny, as they are right now. Al the alts except Litecoin (which itself is basically just an inferior Bitcoin clone) have tiny market caps and tiny liquidity.\n\nAs for bitshares and their having 'solved volatility'... I don't think volatility is anything that needs solving. Volatility is a natural state of new assets, until they find a stable value. The point of Bitcoin is to be an asset without counterparty risk. USD and GLD *do* have counterparty risk and are part of the current system; Bitcoiners want to have their own independent system. If one wants USD, you can just buy USD. If you want gold, it's better to buy ohysical gold, not a gold IOU (like GLD).": 1, 'I think BitTorrent is fantastic.  I use it on a daily basis.

Although there have been several hypotheses for its origin in the past, the current most widely accepted explanation is that the Moon formed from the debris left over after a\xc2\xa0giant impact\xc2\xa0between Earth and a\xc2\xa0Mars-sized body called\xc2\xa0Theia.\n\nThe Moon is in\xc2\xa0synchronous rotation\xc2\xa0with Earth, always showing the same face with its\xc2\xa0near side\xc2\xa0marked by dark volcanic\xc2\xa0maria\xc2\xa0that fill between the bright ancient crustal highlands and the prominent\xc2\xa0impact craters. It is the second-brightest regularly visible\xc2\xa0celestial object\xc2\xa0in Earth's sky (after theSun), as measured by\xc2\xa0illuminance\xc2\xa0on Earth's surface. Although it can appear a\xc2\xa0very bright white, its surface is actually dark, with a\xc2\xa0reflectancejust slightly higher than that of worn asphalt. Its prominence in the sky and its regular cycle of\xc2\xa0phases\xc2\xa0have, since ancient times, made the Moon an important cultural influence on\xc2\xa0language,\xc2\xa0calendars,\xc2\xa0art, and\xc2\xa0mythology.\n\nThe Moon's gravitational influence produces the\xc2\xa0ocean tides\xc2\xa0and the\xc2\xa0slight lengthening\xc2\xa0of the day. The Moon's current orbital distance is about thirty times the diameter of Earth, causing it to have an\xc2\xa0apparent size\xc2\xa0in the sky almost the same as that of the\xc2\xa0Sun. This allows the Moon to cover the Sun nearly precisely in total\xc2\xa0solar eclipse. This matching of apparent visual size is a coincidence.
