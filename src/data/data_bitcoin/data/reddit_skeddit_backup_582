That isn\'t what SPV is. No, using a *bloom filtering SPV wallet* makes you independent of a server, with the caveat that bloom filtering SPV can\'t offer the diverse array of privacy tweaks the client-server architecture can, neither can bloom filtering SPV offer proof of completeness without vastly increased resource requirements which can never realistically be implemented except in a client-server SPV architecture.\n\n> I am the main developer of Electrum. The original post contains statements that are not true. Electrum does indeed connect to a single server in order to fetch transactions and address histories. However, it also connects to MANY servers in order to fetch block headers, find and verify the longest chain, and verify that all the transactions in its history are consistent with the blockchain, using SPV.\n>\n> SPV is a way to check that all transactions received by the client are in the blockchain. However, SPV is not a proof of completeness: the client has no proof that it received all the transactions that are relevant to its wallet (the nodes you are talking to could be lying by omission). Electrum currently does not have a way to verify completeness of its history (although this will be addressed soon). Note that clients using bloom filters (Multibit) have exactly the same weakness: they can verify the transactions they receive (using spv), but they lack a proof of completeness too.\n>\n> One security advantage of Electrumis that servers are authenticated using SSL; this provides protection against MITM attacks, which is a problem for thin clients, including bloom filter clients. However, this advantage comes at the cost of privacy, because the main Electrum server you use knowns which addresses you are using; bloom filter clients have more privacy (although I believe the default setting in Multibit is to favor speed at the expense of privacy).\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/2feox9/electrum_securityprivacy_model/ck8szc0': 1, 'Great work!\n\nIt is a problem, but also, when you use other non-SPV thin-clients that have a client-server architecture the server knows all your addresses (blockchain.info, GreenAddress, Electrum, DarkWallet / Obelisk, Airbitz, etc.).\n\nFor both kind of architectures (SPV and client-server) there are solutions to this problem, but I think right now nobody implemented any.\n\nUsing SPV clients is still a good idea, it makes you independent of any server.\n\nedit: /u/changetip 1 beer': 6, '/u/nicklerj, lclc_ wants to send you a Bitcoin tip for 1 beer (14,614 bits/$3.50).

If you\'re hesitant to use Electrum "because servers", your concerns are misplaced. It\'s a faulty objection to have considering you get the same privacy destroying result from using bloom filtering SPV wallets.\n\nIn addition, the privacy options you have with a client-server SPV architecture like Electrum\'s far outnumber that which you\'re limited to with bloom filtering SPV. For example, instead of automatically polling one single server for all of your address balances, there could be a more paranoid connection setting where no balances in your Electrum wallet are ever updated until you right-click an address and click "update balance". Better still, right-click and select "update balance from server", and then you can update the balance of one address from one server of your choosing.\n\nTake this together with running Electrum over Tor on [Tails](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/2vp7ow/electrum_bitcoin_client_installed_in_tails_13/), and your addresses would never be grouped together, to your IP, or otherwise. With Electrum on Tails, you can be running a completely ephemeral anonymous wallet with a very high degree of privacy and security. The only way to get better privacy is by running Bitcoin-QT or Armory, but that isn\'t possible to do without downloading the full blockchain.\n\nAnd please understand, "privacy" in bloom filtering SPV wallets comes down to false positives: you request more address balance data than you need for yourself. Here\'s the kicker, you can easily add fake watch-only addresses to your Electrum wallet in order to create false positives of your own, effectively assimilating the privacy model of bloom filtering SPV wallets.\n\nOverall, Electrum\'s approach is far more flexible, it can even do the same false positive based privacy model of bloom filtering if you want that, while offering far better options in the future. You can achieve the same or better privacy protections with Electrum than with bloom filtering approaches. The *only* advantage of bloom filtering is that there is less work to be done resource wise, since the project maintainers don\'t have to worry about coding the server, and clearly servers cost time and money to operate.

The reason is that the developers continually ignore configuration and focus on coding.  We delayed an upgrade to version 0.9 for over 6 months because bitcoin was the only coin that required a newer version of a Debian dependency.\n\nLook at how Java is developed.  There are classes that are "deprecated" for many years before they are removed.  A new version of Java never appears that suddenly deletes some key part of the API.\n\nI worry that this is going to happen when a hard fork comes along.  Instead of making it easy to just compile a new binary and overwrite, the developers might force irrelevant breaking changes like this along with the fork.  It\'s important to change ONLY what is necessary for the security of the system, to announce even minor changes well in advance, and to have a deprecation period.\n\nTo see how absurd this is, we have a working system that has processed over **1000 bitcoins**, more money than some people will ever make in their entire lives - and the developers are asking us to put that at risk simply because they want to remove wildcard characters?': 1, "Nothing I said was personal: I am responding to the content (and tone) of your messages.

The core client and the protocol overlap a lot, the core client is a reference implementation. There are things in the underlying algorithms which really cant go wrong. But software goes wrong all the time, and there are also some more high-level decisions which need correction. Let me give you an example: a block size limit was introduced to prevent data spam from being broadcasted to and stored by all the nodes. This is not a change to the basic underlying protocol, but its something coded in the reference client and somethign which came to network consensus, so right now if your node broadcasts a block bigger than 1 mb, everybody else will reject that block. As the network and transaction volume grew, we are now approaching a point where the size will not be enough ti handle all transactions in a timely manner. There are several ideas about how to increase the limit over time etc. In order to change this, we need to figure out which way is good and can get consensus. And how to change it, because if you just release a new version with doubled size limit, all the bigger blocks these new nodes create will get rejected by all the old nodes, causing some chaos for sure. Of course you can est stuff, but you cannot easily simulate the entire bitcoin network and behavior of node operators. Will they update or not? How fast? So all changes are applied while the bitcoin network does not stop running, and once some updates are out and people use the new versions, you cannot revert the state to some backup before the change.
