Your point is a bit circular.  Hyperinflation comes from an (eventual!) loss of faith, and it lags monetary expansion.  As long as expectations are of low inflation, market perversions like QE and zero interest can happen with some impunity.\n\nAll that can be said of your comment is that 4X expansion of base money did nothing.  40 year low in labour participation rates, falling money velocity, falling house and commodity prices...

Real economy growth would have had GDP keep pace with money supply. \n\nSince the quantity of debt increased along with its relative value (as per your graph), debt consolidation will be even more dislocating.  There was no inflating the debt away.  It will either require a depression from debt reneging or a depression through hyperinflation.  \n\nThese things are not linear and will go through bizarre convulsions.  In Weimar hyperinflation lagged monetary expansion and then once confidence was lost, exceeded it!  The interim internal economy boomed in Mark terms but decreased in external terms.

And all of it couched behind NDA\'s whereby he could not "talk about". \n\nThe above the bait to draw everyone in.  Now the reality of all of this is:\n\n- a very cunningly crafted press release designed to suggest that Cantor Fitzgerald was their financial partner in this matter. This to prop up the suggestion that indeed they do have 100 million behind them. However on closer examination it is his friend\'s father Stuart Fraser who happens to be the Co-Chairman of CF who is supporting Gaza in a personal capacity and it is not the company itself being involved.\n\nhttp://www.marketwired.com/press-release/gaw-miners-announces-plans-for-initial-coin-offering-1970991.htm\n\nread that carefully indeed Fraser is an early investor in Garza\'s earlier wireless internet company. And indeed Fraser is Co-Chairman if Cantor Fitzgerald. But that is all.\n\nThis matter was drawn out for months and never addressed always being suggested that NDA\'s prevented it being discussed.\n\n- Once everyone signed on believe all the above, the statement by Garza that he had Amazon Walmart and Target already on board and in partnership and on standby, all references to this were deleted and erased from their forum.  Thereafter it shifted into outright denial that it was ever said. However there are remnants of many posters exclaiming dismay and disbelief that once the operation became underway, there was not relationship with Amazon, Walmart an Target.\n\n[ quotes ]\n\n(a) so you dont have amazon, walmart and target lined up to accept hashcoin, bummer\n\n(b) So, basically, there is no big merchant adoption like the one that has been advertised.\n\n(c) As an end user, I was already under the assumption that major merchant adoption was in place by previous statements. It now looks to be very different in scope. I would just caution to be very careful in wording you commitments towards your Customer base. Misleading statements will break the trust barrier and it is hard win those folks back into the circle.\n\n(d) hmmm...I thought you had big merchants ready to go and I thought you had purchased a better name than Hashcoin...im kinda confused at this point...\n\nThose remnant comments have since been scrubbed from their forum.\n\nhttps://hashtalk.org/topic/16399/some-thoughts-on-merchant-adoption\n\nEven so I am fairly confident that enough people if asked directly do they recall Garza explicitly confirming existing partnerships with Amazon, Walmart and Target, they would absolutely confirm so.\n\nSince all that further investigations by coinfire.cf garnered absolute denials by these companies having anything to do with Garza and his companies.  All the while Garza continued the pretense with continued reference to NDA\'s being in place and that he could not discuss anything.\n\nAnd lo and be hold that is exactly where we are today. Zero connection or relationship with Amazon, Walmart and Target, a second set of absolute confirmations by these companies that they have nothing to do with Garza and his companies. Garza now frantically trying to introduce a browser plugin to interface and allow his victims to effect purchases from these stores.

Outright lies misdirections and false claims and promises. Others can address all that if they wish to ample fresh evidence confirming it all along with archived posts and screen prints etc.\n\nThe crux of the matter is as mentioned before the entire trick to get people signed up thinking that they had this massive financial backing and that they were in partnership with this massive vendors, is what the scam is and where it started.': 7, 'BitttBurger 200 bits /u/changetip\nThx for that. \n': 2, 'Thanks! /u/changetip $1': 1, 'What lawyer?\n\nEdit:\n\nWhat is the name of the lawyer?': 1, '**Proof of mining.** GAW ordered 5 PH/s of SHA256 hardware from Bitmain.
