The Bitcoin network is just another third-party payment processor; the main difference is that anybody on the Internet can participate in processing transactions, so you don\'t have to rely on one centralized organization (like Mastercard) to run things.\n\n    Of course, in order for this to work, you have to use the Bitcoin network\'s currency rather than the dollar; the Bitcoin network\'s currency is the "bitcoin".\n\nNext you can explain:\n\n* Payment processing is just one thing computers on the Internet can do; you can actually use this same technology to do any other sort of computation. In other words, Bitcoin software provides a foundation for distributing computing tasks across a large number of computers on the Internet without having to trust any one of them in particular to do the right thing.\n\n    Currently, the Bitcoin network cannot do such generalized distributed computation, but there are a number of ventures that are trying to make it a reality in the near future.\n\n*Now* you can talk about blocks, hashes, blockchains, and the like.\n\nAnyway, thanks for spreading the word. 4 kilobits /u/changetip': 1, '/u/jatucker, bettercoin wants to send you a Bitcoin tip for 4 kilobits (4,000 bits/$1.52).

This is essential for bitcoiners to comprehend the faults of current debt based monetary policy, and how bitcoin can be solutions to these problems. \n\nTo me, the most important section (though all of it is very important and relevant), is section 7. I believe it details the struggle of our cycle of failure in the most comprehensive and detailed manner. Understanding this article will enable you to have intelligent conversations/retorts with people who blame capitalism for our problems. Capitalism is merely a mechanism of business practices. It is the the *way* our money supply is created and managed that is the real culprit to destructive socioeconomical forces. Section 8 really compounds the point in 7, as it details even more so how society and ecology interacts, and how finite resources makes our current system unsustainable. \n\n> #7. Money as debt contributes to growth pressure.\n\n> Money created as debt carries interest and thereby contributes to a twofold growth pressure on the monetary system and on the real economy. When customers repay their loans to the commercial banks, the banks write off the returned amount of money and the amount of money in circulation correspondingly decreases. However, debtors need more money than they have borrowed because they also have to pay interest on their loans. Even if the debtors replace their old loans by new ones, they need additional income for interest payments and must therefore realize profits. Business on the whole cannot be profitable unless the quantity of money continuously increases. This leads to the dynamics of growth which is a core characteristic of our economic system. The increase in the quantity of interest-bearing money exerts a monetary growth pressure on the real economy and the growth of the real economy simultaneously exerts an anti-deflationary growth pressure on the money supply. As a consequence of this twofold growth pressure, our economy is a kind of Ponzi scheme, since it cannot work properly without growing and therefore repeatedly falls into crises. Furthermore, the growth of the real economy, which is to a great extent forced by the monetary system, involves an excessive exploitation of natural resources and is a hindrance to sustainable development. Financial indebtedness thus leads to ecological indebtedness towards nature, which impoverishes mankind. Our current monetary system is just not compatible with a finite world. ': 1, "It's too long.

If you entrust a secret to your friend Todd, and then the next day everybody at the office is tittering and glancing sideways at you and somebody you\'ve never met in accounting repeats the information back to you which you held in confidence with Todd (in a format unique to your disclosure to him) *then it is proven that Todd mishandled your information* because the wrong domain (random colleagues) passed a proof of knowledge test that they should have failed. You do not have to opine about "Well I never *saw* Todd tell the secret"; the fact that the secret is being displayed where it does not belong (and there exists no ambiguity as to it\'s source) is the only evidence you require.\n\nEqually, if you try to use a forgot-password link on a website and it either straight up displays your password to you (perhaps after answering a security question) or emails it to you in cleartext, then that site is mishandling your password data.

The problem is that it requires atomistic competition on the part of the miners who validate transactions blocks. However, the mining industry is characterized by large economies of scale. In fact, these economies of scale are so large that the industry is a natural monopoly. The problem is that atomistic competition and a natural monopoly are inconsistent: the inbuilt centralization tendencies of the natural monopoly mean that mining firms will become bigger and bigger \xe2\x80\x93 and eventually produce an actual monopoly.\n\n>There are not one but two reasons to see mining as a natural monopoly. The first is based on risk aversion. If two miners merge their operations, they get the same expected return as if they mined on their own, but they obtain a return with a higher probability. If miners are risk averse, they are better off by pooling and sharing their profits. But if it makes sense for any two individual miners to pool, it makes sense for any two groups of miners to pool. The limiting case is then one big mining pool, a monopoly.\n\n>The second reason for a natural monopoly is even stronger: the negative externalities of competitive mining. The expected marginal benefit from mining depends on the amount of hash power expected by an individual miner, but the difficulty of mining depends on the hash power expended across the network. Individual miners do not take into account the negative cost externalities that their own activities impose on other miners. We then get an equilibrium in which excessive resources are devoted to mining activities: there is excessive use of bandwidth, excessive use of energy and excessive investment in computing resources. In the early days, a home PC could produce hundreds of bitcoins a day; now, a state of the art mining machine can expect to mine only a fraction of a bitcoin a day.

The news from Microsoft is really great for everyone involved. \n\nIt\'s been a really rough year for bitcoin. If you zoom out on those graphs even further, you\'ll see that around this time last year, bitcoin absolutely skyrocketed from around $200 to over $1000. Lots of factors led up to that insane rally, but one thing is certain: It didn\'t last. That being said, we\'re still considerably higher than when that last rally began. Some speculate the price will continue to fall back into the $200s, but in all honesty, nobody really knows. In the short term, it\'s really hard to gauge where the market will move next, but obviously most people around here are quite optimistic about bitcoin\'s long term potential, especially with massive companies slowly getting on board. \n\nAnother thing that has contributed to bitcoin\'s rough year is the collapse of the Mt Gox bitcoin exchange earlier this year. That was quite catastrophic and pulled the entire market down considerably. Many are having trouble trusting bitcoin itself, even though bitcoin didn\'t fail. Mt Gox did.\n\nFurthermore, bitcoin is facing impending government regulations as it becomes clear that it won\'t be going away any time soon. Governments *want* to regulate, but they\'re not sure what the best approach is since bitcoin is unique in many ways. But we all know it\'s coming, and nobody can be certain what effects it may have on the market. It\'s important to note that bitcoin is absolutely not a \'get rich quick\' scheme. Anyone getting involved purely for the purpose of making money is doing so for the wrong reasons. There\'s absolutely no guarantees and the protocol and software itself is still considered experimental. Some are willing to take that risk. Many are not. The cardinal rule around here is, "Never invest anything you\'re not willing to lose". Everything may work out splendidly, but it may not. Each person is responsible for calculating their own risk tolerance. \n\nHope that helps! We have weekly "Moronic Monday" Q/A threads where anyone can ask any bitcoin questions without feeling embarrassed by the fact that they\'re new or just want to learn more about a certain topic. This stuff goes very deep and covers a range of math and technologies. It usually takes a solid week or two of reading and asking before people get to the point where they decide to go even deeper, so don\'t be intimidated. Keep reading and asking whatever questions you have as they arise, and eventually you\'ll have all the info you need to make an informed decision about whether or not bitcoin is of practical use to you.

The problem is only if you want to do this without exposing the seed value to any one of the part holders, which would nullify any independence. \n\nYou could use a scheme similar to the third party vanity address gen scheme where public keys are combined to create a new secret private key. Each party would keep their private key safe but provide the public key to be combined (EC add/multiply) to create a master public key (MPK). This can be used to generate addresses which can only be spent by combining all users private keys ("key chain"). (I don\'t think an M of N scheme is possible this way).\n\nOnce you have the MPK you can generate addresses easily as needed - only some hashing and a single EC pt multiply operation (tools are around for this).\n\nKeep in mind the address balances are only related to the original multisig but not controlled by the multisig process. To spend you need to combine the private keys to form a master private key, which can generate derived keys matching the addresses. Also, it\'s a one-time process - once the master key is derived and used you cannot re-use it securely. You would need to sweep funds to a new "key chain".\n\nI\'m not aware of any tools for doing these steps but it should be relatively easy to write them up to work with existing BIP32 tools.': 2, "Theoretically there's no reason why it shouldn't work, but I don't know of any wallet that supports this. I'd like to have this as well. ": 2, 'This is exactly how the Coinbase vault works.': 2, 'Yes, you can do what you say.\n\nA BIP38 wallet is just a single bitcoin private key which is encrypted with a password.\n\n(There\'s also a little-known part of the BIP38 protocol which allows one person to create an encrypted private key that they never had the unencrypted version of.  That way you can for example have a paper-wallet generator create encrypted paper wallets for you that you know they never had the private key for.  That\'s why casascius originally created BIP38, so that he could sell his Casascius Coins and his customers would know for sure he couldn\'t steal the funds.  It\'s rarely used any more now that multisig has developed.)\n\nA multisig wallet is an address whose "private key" is actually multiple keys, and so more than 1 key is required to spend money from that address.  The most common form is 2-of-3, which means that an address created with three keys needs any two of them to spend the money.  But there are also 3-of-3 and 2-of-2 and any mix and match number of up to n-of-15, where 15 is the maximum number that the protocol currently supports (due to the size of the redeem script).\n\nA BIP32 wallet is a bitcoin address and/or private key, with extra information added to the address which tells it how to derive addresses from it.  A BIP32 "master" address is derived, basically by hashing some data.  So that input data that gets hashed could be anything really -- including the private key from a different address.\n\nYou can mix and match any of those methods to your heart\'s desire.\n\n--------\n\nAs somebody pointed out, Coinbase does that with their "Vault".  The way the vault works is that Coinbase generates 3 private keys in your browser.  They use one of them to create a BIP32 address that they give you the public version of (and they keep the private key), they BIP38 encrypt another one with your password, and they store the encrypted version as well as the BIP32 public address.  And then the third one is yours, which you have the unencrypted private key for, and use to derive the public and private BIP32 keys.\n\nSo all three public BIP32 keys are known, and since BIP32 keys can have "child" keys derived from them, and the process is publicly known, both you and they can derive the public child keys if given the "parent" master public key.  So they create a multisig address by for example taking the first "child" address of all three BIP32 keys, and using those three child keys to create a multisig address.  And you can verify that the address is really correct without decrypting anything since the process is done using only public keys.  Then, when you log into coinbase and want to spend money from that address, they sign it using their private key, and then they stick your encrypted key in your browser cache/memory, and you decrypt it and sign the tx all in your browser cache/memory, and send them back the signed tx.  The actual user experience for the lay user just looks like they entered their password and the tx magically got signed, but the behind the scenes means that Coinbase never actually can even access those funds without the user decrypting the key.  So (assuming they aren\'t hacked and feeding you a malicious javascript), they CAN\'T access vault funds.\n\nYou however, since you have your unencrypted private key, as well as the encrypted private key plus your password, have two of the three private keys and can thus spend the multisig money.  That way, if Coinbase goes down, you don\'t lose access to your money.\n\nI wrote the technical details of retrieving Coinbase vault funds [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoinBase/comments/2mjvwz/technical_instructions_for_getting_vault_money/).': 3}, ("Ethereum's Vitalik Buterin Wins World Technology Network Award", 5): {'This is great news for blockchain tech!': 1}, ('New to BTC, how can I keep my funds secure?', 5): {'I will hold your coins for you.
