Photon mapping for example has been used backwards from the camera in determining how to distribute photons to focus on areas more likely to be visible from the camera. It doesn't make sense then to focus on redrawing areas that are already smooth and to focus on areas that have the most noise, so knowing where there will be the most deviation has several benefits which would include validating if an image is in range.

Users now being notified.', 49): {'[deleted]': 2, 'Notice of Data Breach\n \nDear Gyft User,\n\nWe are writing to let you know about an incident that potentially involves your Gyft account. As described below, an unknown party may have gained unauthorized access to certain Gyft user information. We are taking this incident very seriously. As soon as Gyft learned about the exposure, we began investigating how this user information was accessed and what risks this potentially posed to Gyft customers. Fortunately, we have not discovered evidence that anyone used the information potentially compromised in this incident to access Gyft accounts or make unauthorized purchases. \n\nNonetheless, please carefully read this notice. \n \nWhat Happened?\n\nBeginning on October 3 and continuing through December 18, 2015, an unknown party accessed without authorization two cloud providers used by Gyft. This unknown party was able to view or download certain Gyft user information stored with these cloud providers and make a file containing some of that user information. \n \nWhat Information Was Involved?\n\nThe information potentially accessed from the cloud providers included names, addresses, dates of birth, phone numbers, email addresses, and gift card numbers. Gift card numbers could have been used to make unauthorized purchases. In addition, if you attempted to use Gyft between March 19 and December 4, 2015, your Gyft log-in credentials may have been compromised. An unauthorized party who acquired your credentials could have accessed your Gyft account and used any gift cards in your account with unused balances, or used available reward points or a Coinbase-enabled account to purchase additional gift cards. Importantly, no credit cards stored in your Gyft account were compromised because full credit card numbers are not visible in Gyft accounts and any credit card purchases require the three- or four -digit security code on the back or front of your credit card, which was not part of the information that may have been compromised.\n \nWhat Are We Doing?\n\nShortly after discovering this issue, Gyft acted to prevent unauthorized access by forcing users whose passwords were potentially compromised to reset their passwords and logging out other affected users. Affected users who have not already done so will be forced to choose a new password the next time they log in. We also reset the Coinbase tokens for all affected customers. We are continuing to investigate the incident and will take all appropriate steps to protect Gyft customers. \n\nFor the latest information on this incident go to: www.myidcare.com/gyft.\n \nWhat You Can Do\n\nWe recommend that you change your password for any online account where you use the same password that you used for Gyft between March 19 and December 4, 2015. As discussed above, credit cards stored through Gyft were not affected by this incident. However, if you have a Coinbase account linked to your Gyft account, we recommend that you review any Coinbase transactions beginning in October 2015, because a linked Coinbase account could have been used to make purchases within your Gyft account. You should also monitor any gift cards that were in your Gyft account before January 8, 2016.\n\nAlthough the information potentially involved in this incident does not affect your credit, we are required by law to provide you certain information about your credit report and identity theft. This information is enclosed. \n\nYou may also contact us in writing at 150 W. Evelyn Avenue, Suite 300, Mountain View, CA 94041, or you can call us at 866-287-0504.\n\nOn behalf of Gyft, we regret any inconvenience this may cause you.\n\nSincerely, \nCJ MacDonald\nChief Operating Officer, Gyft\n \n \nAdditional Information Regarding Identity Theft and Your Credit Report\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission (FTC) provides information about how to avoid identity theft and what to do if you suspect your identity has been stolen. You may contact the FTC at FTC Identity Theft Clearinghouse, 600 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW, Washington, D.C. 20580, www.consumer.ftc.gov, 1-877-ID-THEFT (877-438-4338). You can also contact local law enforcement or the attorney general\xe2\x80\x99s office in your state if you suspect that you have been the victim of identity theft.\n\nYou also may obtain a free copy of your credit report maintained by each of the three credit reporting agencies by visiting www.annualcreditreport.com or by calling toll-free 1-877-322-8228. Review the reports carefully, and if you find anything you do not understand or that is incorrect, contact the appropriate credit reporting agency. \n\nYou also may consider contacting the credit reporting agencies directly if you wish to put in place a fraud alert or a security freeze or to obtain additional information regarding identity theft. An initial fraud alert is free and lasts for at least 90 days. The alert informs creditors of possible fraudulent activity within your report and requests that the credit company contact you prior to establishing any accounts in your name. In contrast, a security freeze prohibits a credit reporting agency from releasing any information from a consumer\xe2\x80\x99s credit report without prior written permission. Placing a security freeze on your credit report may delay your ability to obtain credit. \n\nTo place a fraud alert or security freeze on your credit report, contact any the three credit reporting agencies using the contact information below: \n\nEquifax: 1-800-525-6285; www.equifax.com; P.O.

Good. They should have done that whether they were notified or not. I have.\n\n> "also reset the Coinbase tokens for all affected customers"\n\nUsers affected will have to log in again, if they do so at all. Good.

Nobody outside of yourself and your immediate circle of family of friends cares about any of this data. They\'re not going to call you. They\'re not going to send you a birthday card. They\'re not going to drop by for tea.\n\n> Login credentials\n\nYou should be using a password wallet. You should have a different password for every place you log in. You should be using Two-Factor Authentication. Your point about hashed passwords means nothing if you\'re following best password practices.\n\n> If using Coinbase\n\nYou should never allow a service to have access to your whole account. Coinbase should allow you to create a wallet specifically to use with Gyft and only fund it when looking to purchase a card or three. Gyft should only connect to that particular wallet when buying cards. All your other funds should be protected. This is the way the Shift card works. Until this is put in place, linking the two is bad Bitcoin practices. Until then, use their Bitpay link and pay them directly.\n\nYou can have it easy or you can have it secure.

YouTube doesn't decide copyright disputes. There are two kinds of takedowns, Content ID and DMCA. I believe you got DMCA'd. If your video got DMCA'd, you can file a DMCA counter notice. That is a legal notification that you think you do have the rights to the video.\n\nThe DMCA process works like this: Lawyers send a DMCA notice to Youtube. Youtube is by law required to take the video down. However, you can file the counter-notification. Once you file it, Youtube will forward it to PayPal, including your contact information which you have to include. Now, PayPal has to sue you within ~2 weeks and provide evidence they did so to YouTube. If they don't, the video is reinstated.\n\nThe EFF has an excellent page explaining it: https://www.eff.org/issues/intellectual-property/guide-to-youtube-removals\n\nThat said, Fair Use law is notoriously murky. If you throw 2 lawyers into a room with a video, the two lawyers will probbaly come out with five different opinions whether it is fair use or not. Thus, I can't blame you for not trying to go the counter-notification route and just re-upload it.\n\nAlso note that ANY US video provider follows this law. If Paypal reads this post and didn't read the Wikipedia page on the Streisand effect yet, they'll probably send DMCA notices to all of the hosts above, and they *will* take it down.\n\nI'm just surprised I haven't seen a magnet (torrent) link for the video yet.

The numbers on the document you reference are off by over an order of magnitude.\n\nIt would help in this discussion if people would stop using wildly exaggerated numbers which could never be achieved in the real world.\n\nYou claim that with 1mb blocks the bitcoin network could handle 120 million users (so long as they do their payment activity on the lighting network). \n\nThe current real-world capacity of the bitcoin network today with 1mb blocks is about 250,000 transactions per day max. It takes two transactions minimum to use the Lighting Network; one to open the channel and another to close a channel. So, for 120 million people to each perform two transactions take 960 days (32 months) using 100% of the entire capacity of the bitcoin network\n\nDays = (120000000*2) / 250000\n\nWith that many people trying to access the bitcoin blockchain, the average backlog to open or close a channel would be many, many, months.\n\nAs you should know, the Lighting Network is extremely time sensitive. Transactions to close out a channel have to be processed in a timely manner, or funds can be lost. The Lightning Network requires an uncongested bitcoin network to function.\n\nIn reality, people need to open and close more than one channel every 32 months. The average user will need to open multiple channels, and may need to close channels as their situation changes. When a user opens a channel they must \xe2\x80\x98lock-in\xe2\x80\x99 a certain amount of funds, and the amount locked-in by their channel gates the maximum value they can send or receive. No one can perfectly guess just how much money they need to tie up in a channel, so if they ever need to send or receive more money than the channel capacity, then they have to open a new channel.\n\nIn addition, if anyone is performing attacks on users of the Lightning Network, it may require closing the channel to avoid loss of funds.\n\nSo long as people keep repeating insane claims like 120 million people can use the bitcoin network with Lightning, we aren\xe2\x80\x99t going to make any progress.\n\nWhat are the actual real word numbers?

At least, if you think 10 years to the future. Bitcoin is rather tiny today but the growth would have to very significantly stagnate to not have 120 million users in 10 years. To doubt the scenario is akin to believing we will fail to improve scalability enough during the next 10 years.\n\n>You do understand that if the bitcoin blockchain is 100% saturated with tens of million people trying to open and close channels that there will be an eternal backlog resulting in confirmation times measured in weeks, if not months, right?\n\n100% saturated does not equal useless. You'd have to assume the fee market just doesn't work at all to make that assumption. The way transaction fees are already increasing in response to transaction pressure proves that it works. Assuming a constant backlog of even just several days requires a mindset where you expect everyone to stubbornly refuse to increase their transaction fee. That makes no sense. Some will pay more and some will figure out some other way to pay and the pressure will stabilize.\n\nA congestion event will slow down growth. However, with LN, the increased fees will also motivate increased efficiency in channel use, so transaction pressure from LN will also decrease as a result and allow a little more growth before the next congestion.

The bus is on a route and can carry a total of 1,000 passengers a day.  The bus runs 24/7 so, if people queue up, exactly at even intervals, throughout the entire day, morning noon and night, then 1,000 people could, indeed, ride the bus.  But, that isn't how people work.  They bunch up at particular times in the morning and in the afternoon.  Since there is not enough room for them, some people will end up getting to work extremely late.  If they can bump themselves up in priority, then the very, very, wealthy people will get to work on time, and those who are poorer will get fired from their jobs because they show up 8 hours or more late.\n\nBut...that isn't the situation we are describing.  What if 2,000 people want to ride the bus every day, but it can only carry a 1,000?  And the 'Central Core Planning Committee' simply **refuses** to allow more buses to run.  And, let's say the bus works like Uber surge pricing, and will take people in order of how much they are willing to pay.  With this replace-by-fee mechanism the richest 1,000 people will get to ride the bus, those who pay the most will wait the shortest amount of time to get a ride, and the others will also end up having to wait a very long time and be quite late.\n\nBut..and here is the point of restricted capacity.  What about the other 1,000 people.  **THEY DON'T EVER GET TO RIDE THE BUS AT ALL!!!**\n\nWhen demand exceeds capacity, the whole system fails.\n\nIf you are expecting people to only open and close one payment channel every six months then, regardless of how much they 'replace by fee', the *average* wait time for the average person (not the uber wealthy) will be on the order of days, weeks, or even months.  Some won't *ever* be able to get a transaction process.\n\nSo, once again, can you not see how assuming a massive number of people can cycle the bitcoin blockchain just once every six months, using up 100% of the total capacity of the network will simply not work?\n\nThe Lightning Network *requires* that transactions be processed in a timely fashion or people will **LOSE THEIR MONEY**.\n\nThe point here is that even if all payment transactions are handled by the lightning network, the main bitcoin blockchain transaction capacity will have to be dramatically increased to support more users capable of opening and closing channels **in a timely fashion**.

And, if confirmation times are that backed up then both the bitcoin and the LN are broken.\n\nThere has to be available capacity for any regular user to be able to open and close a channel with little to no delay for the LN to work.\n\nNot that any of this matters, because getting tens of millions of active users of the bitcoin network is a pretty wild scenario to begin with.   There are only 15.2 million bitcoins ever created, and substantially less than that even available for people to purchase.  So, if we have 120 million people who all wanted to buy some bitcoin, they could each only own a small fraction of just one.\n\nI think sometimes people forget just how tiny bitcoin is.\n\nStating that the LN offers a multiplier effect is sufficient, you don't need to make wild claims disconnected from reality.": 1}, ("What exchanges are popular these days?
