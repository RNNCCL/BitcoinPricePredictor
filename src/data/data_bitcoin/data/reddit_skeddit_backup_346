The best mempool needs to be one that has enough txns to be a minimum of 1 full block behind, and as the next block is found, miners can lock in a set and start hashing.\n\nIf the max block size is too big, and miners decide to clear out the mempool entirely, the next job will have nothing to do, or will have a very small reward. They can save money by turning off the miner for the next few minutes until a decent pool returns. This will reduce the difficulty over time which increases risk of a 51% attack.\n\nMeanwhile if it is too small, the backlog will grow big and the system will feel slow and fees will increase. Some miners would want to open up the blocksize so they can make more short term profit by capitalising on the larger backlog volume (and eat up the higher fees before they return to normal).\n\nLetting the miners change the block size lets them find this equilibrium imo.\n\nAssuming num of tx only ever trends upwards on average, it makes sense that Jeff's proposal should only ever allow voting upwards in order to support the backlog.\n\nIdeally the blocksize should be related to the mempool, but there are problems with synchronising mempools ATM.\n\n(Of course, this is ignoring the cost of verifying and relaying a transaction.

Their ideal scenario is creating such a backlog that genuine users are forced to continually ratchet up their fee to be included in a block while the attackers transactions eventually leave the mempool with minimum capital expended.\n\n The only defense the Bitcoin system has is seizing the attackers capital by placing their transactions into blocks.\n\nIf an attacker has $billions in resources to "attack" Bitcoin then we must have the capacity to let them buy $billions worth of Bitcoin, driving up its value for the benefit of holders (who are the people running nodes) and laugh as they give it to miners in fees.': 6, '[deleted]': 1, '20mb every 10 minutes > 1mb every 10 minutes': 2, "attacks want to destroy bitcoin in many ways.\nI'm pointing out one way it could get destroyed: by a huge blockchain, that will make it more centralized. that's all.": 2, '[removed]': 1, 'Note that I wrote "to **start** mining".

If they solve the puzzle before that, then they post the empty block and move on to the next.\n\nSo, if a miner issues an oversize block, it will not significantly delay the other miners; at worst, it will only increase the chance of them mining an empty block.  Then they will lose 0.1 BTC in fees perhaps, but still earn the 25 BTC of block reward.  On the other hand, the miner who artificially bloated his block will run increased risk of the block being orphaned, and will not earn any extra fees (since they will be paid by himself).': 1, '> spam attacks make it necessary to impose an upper limit for the damage that can be done\n\nSpam attacks are an irrefutable argument to **increase** the block size limit **now**, even before the natural traffic gets too close to the capacity (expected in early 2016).\n\nIn order to create and maintain a backlog of unconfirmed transactions (which is necessary for the attack to have any effect on clients) the attacker must issue more than C - N transactions per second, where C is the network\'s capacity and N is the normal traffic.  \n\nRight now, with the 1 MB limit, C is about 180\'000 tx/day = 2.1 tx/s, and N is 120\'000 tx/day = 1.4 tx/s, so the attacker only needs to issue more than 60\'000 tx/day = 0.7 tx/s.\n\nWith 8 MB limit, C shoudl be 8 times that, namely 1\'440\'000 tx/day = 16.7 tx/s, but N will be the same; so the attacker will have to issue 1\'320\'000 tx/day = 15.3 tx/s, which is "only" ~20 times what he needs with 1 MB blocks.  Moreover, any backlog that the attacker manages to create will be cleared ~20 times faster with 8 MB blocks than 1 Mb blocks, once the attack stops.': 1, 'Increasing the block size limit is necessary to prevent network saturation and to make spam attacks more expensive, hence less likely.  The authors of the big "stress test" of July 7-19 claimed to have only ~5000 USD budget.  If the block size limit had been 8 MB instead of 1 MB, they would have needed to issue 10-12 times as many transactions per second (hence spend 10-12 times as much) in order to start and sustain a backlog, and the backlog would have cleared 10-12 times faster.\n\nIncreasing the block size limit to 8 MB will not cause the blockchain to grow 8 times in size.  In the absence of spam attacks, the traffic should just continue growing at its natural pace, from the current 120\'000 tx/day to perhaps 150\'000 tx/day by early 2016.  At that point, the average block size would have increased from 500 kB to 750 kB.   At that point, with 1 MB block size limit, frequent traffic jams will probably occur during peak traffic days and hours, with very serious consequences for the usability and image of bitcoin.  With 8 MB block size limit, the average block size will just continue growing slowly, probably reaching 1 MB by mid-2016, perhaps 1.5 MB by mid-2017, etc.  Thus, raising the block size limit  will not affect the cost or running a full node for another 6 to 12 months, and will have a gradual effect after that.\n\nIn case of a serious spam attack (with above-minimum fees), all the transactions issued by the attacker be eventually  included in the blockchain, whether the block size limit is 1 MB or 8 MB.  Therefore, in the case of a spam attack, the block size limit will not make any difference for the total size of the blockchain, hence for the cost of running a full node.  The only difference is that, with 1 MB block size limit, the spammer\'s transactions may be spread out over (say) ~1400 blocks, each 500 + 300 = 800 kB in size, spanning ~10 days; whereas, with 8 MB block size limit, the same transactions would be packed into ~70 blocks, each 500 + 6000 = 6500 kB in size, spanning 12 hours.  \n\nTo better protect against spam attacks, one should increase the block size limit **and** also increase the minimum fee to something significant, say about 0.10-0.30 USD/tx.  That would make spam attacks even more expensive and hence less likely.  A minimum fee increase would also cut down on "frivolous" traffic, and encourage miners to process the unconfirmed transactions more promptly instead of mining empty blocks.': 4, 'If the block size is 8mb-20mb, there can be a cooperation of several big pools in order to always push big blocks, to increase the size of the blockchain rapidly and FOREVER and prevent competition from smaller miners.\n\nOr, alternatively, a spam attack on the network without any fees (thus, free attack), just to make 8mb blocks....\n\nI do agree that there should be a minimum fee. but i believe that it should be based on the market. thus, in the time of the attack, the fee will need to be higher. in time where there is no attack, the fee can be lower.': 1, 'Sleep easy my sweet angel.  \nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law': 1, '30 gb? not convenient, you need a large hard disk, but fine.\n\n30 tb? its not going to be easy to store it.': 2, '/u/bitcoin88771, invertedNormal wants to send you a Bitcoin tip for 10 cache (1,000 bits/$0.29).

': -1, '> the intended mechanism used to distribute the 21 million bitcoins in a transparent and fair way\n\nYes, that *was* the intent.  Satoshi did not have any way of knowing how much a bitcoin would be worth in the year 2008 + N, when he picked the reward schedule parameters.  \n\nI wonder if he had any hunches.  The fee schedule would make sense if he was expecting the price to double every 4 years.  The earliest price I have is 0.05 $/\xc9\x83 in 2010-07-17; it had already doubled to 0.10 $/\xc9\x83 three months later, on 2010-10-15, about the date when Satoshi was abducted.   If the price had never risen above 0.10 $/\xc9\x83, there would not be a mining industry, perhaps not even on GPUs.\n\nBut by the time the price hit 100 USD in 2013, mining bitcoin had already became more profitable than mining gold.  Right now, as you know, the bitcoin mining industry has a revenue of abut 1 million USD/day.  That money does not come from thin air.  There is one one place it can come from, and it is the new investors --- the people who are buying bitcoins to increase their holdings.  \n\nIt is the real dollars from those people that are sustaining the miners, and the 400 PH/s that are supposed to be the network\'s big advantage over other altcoins and centrlized databases.  The value of the system *to its users* would obviously be diminished if that mining industry were to disappear, and be replaced by a few computer nerds with laptops.  So, if that million dollars per day is money that someone is paying and will never get back, and if it is paying for something that benefits the users of the network (and only them) -- why shouldn\'t be counted as the cost of the network?  \n\n> Or were bitcoiners forced to stop using Bitcoin during the stress tests? No they weren\'t, the fee market mechanism worked as intended.\n\nYou can\'t make up "facts" like that.  Thousands of legitimate transactions got delayed by hours, even by days.  Behind each transaction there was a client.  Chances are that 90% of them did not even know that a "stress test" was going on, much less how the fees affect mining.  How can you claim that they were all happy "that the fee market worked"?  How can you be sure that no one gave up on bitcoin after that experience?\n\nAnd it is totally false that "the fee market worked as intended", because there was no "fee market".  The backlog was huge (250 MB) and took a week to clear, but it was almost all created by an entity that had no other goal than creating a 250 MB backlog.  Thus most of the "test" transactions had the default fee.  Clients who knew what was going on and paid anything above that fee got through as if the backlog was not there.  So the transactions that were delayed for a week were mostly those of the test itself, plus an unknown number of legitimate transactions by non-expert clients.  \n\nA backlog *of normal traffic* would not be anything like that.  If a backlog of 30\'000 legitimate transactions builds up, it will take some 8 hours to clear, and *10\'000 clients will have to wait 4 hours or more for their first confirmation, with "fee market" or without it*.  Can you understand this?\n\n> Please tell me why you keep being so insincere in so many of your arguments all the time? I really want to know.\n\nCan\'t you really see how your views are based on wishes, more than facts?\n': 1, '>  problem of the limited available block size\n\nBut that is the point: in normal operation, ***space in the blocks is NOT a limited resource***.  It was not meant to be limited, and should not be limited -- because a congested network is bad, and should be avoided at all costs.  Keeping the 1 MB limit in place while the normal traffic increases will create *artificial* scarcity.\n\nThe cost of running the network is huge, and is being offset to investors instead of users; both are severe problems (that are among the reasons why I am very skeptical about the future of bitcoin).  However, those problems are consequences of (overinflated price) + (fixed block reward) + (proof-of-work requirement) + (hashrate competition).  The excessive cost of the network does not come from validation or internet costs, that are insignificant compared to the cost of mining.  In fact, **the cost of running the network is practically independent of the block size limit, or of the average block size**.  \n\nFurthermore, the investors will have to bear the same cost -- 3600 BTC/day -- no matter what the fees are.\n\n> or part of the demand has to be taken off-chain or to side-chains or to payment channels such as the Lightning network.\n\nThe last I read about sidechains was that they would not solve the scalability problem.  As for the LN, its design is still at the stage of Leonardo Da Vinci\'s helicopter: there are some ingenious ideas there (like payment channels for micropayments of metered online services), but a couple of crucial ingredients are still missing in order to make the system viable, and no one knows when they will be invented.\n\nSo, when the network gets near congestion, bitcoiners will be forced to stop using it (not because of higher fees, but because of the long erratic delays).  Then they will either give up on bitcoin and use traditional methods, or move their bitcoins to Coinbase or Circle and do their payments through them.  Which of course is not "using bitcoin" at all.  \n\nBut "forcing bitcoiners to move their coins to Coinbase and Circle" may be what the VC investors liked the most when Blockstream presented their plans to them... 8-(': 1, '>  Miners do not need to download the blockchain in order to start mining; they only need the header of the last mined block, that does not depend on the block size.\n\nNot true. miners need the full blockchain in order to verify that the transactions that they are inserting into the blockchain are valid and will be accepted by other miners.\n': 2, '> Increased fees should be the result of increased demand,\n\nThe first problem is that there is no "market" in the hypothetical "fee market".\n\nThe miners are not the suppliers that serve the clients, because the latter cannot choose the miner that will confirm their transaction, not even know beforehand which one it will be.  \n\nThere is only one supplier, which is the bitcoin network, and only one service, confirming transactions in the single blockchain.  The miners are the (informal) contractors of the network, like free-lance cooks in the kitchen of a restaurant.  Therefore, it is the network that must set the price, not the miners.  The clients should not even know that miners exist.\n\nAnyone with a minimum of business sense knows that clients must know beforehand the products and their prices, and, once they have ordered and paid, they must be given what they paid for.  Moreover, the price must be propostional to the value of the product, as perceived by the clients; not the cost of *each* particular item to the supplier.  The client does not want to know whether the supplier broke one glass in that 12-glass set, and had to import a replacement from Bali by FedEx.   It is the supplier\'s job to set the prices so that his *total* revenue will cover his *total* costs, accidents and mistakes included, plus an adequate profit. \n\nAnyone with an ounce of common sense should realize the lunacy of requiring clients to remain on-line after issuing a transaction, in order to check its progress and up its fee to keep it in front of the line, while 10\'000 other clients are trying to do the same.  \n\nAnyone with basic numeracy should understand that any fee/priority mechanism can only change the order in which transactions are served, but will not reduce the average waiting time by a single second.  So, inevitably, there will be many clients that will pay more, and even upgrade their fees several times, but will end up waiting a lot more than the expected 10 minutes.\n\nTLDR: **The "fee market" will not work**, and **saturation will be a disaster for bitcoin**.  ': 1, '> nor should it be an argument for a centrally planned fee structure\n\nYes, the "centrally planned fee structure" (if you want to call it that way) is necessary for other reasons -- starting with the premise that the network must not be allowed to get near congestion, in which case there will not be a "fee market" that can set the fees otherwise. \n\nNote that the block reward is already "centrally planned", and in fact fixed in the \'consensus\' part of the protocol.  Having the (much smaller) transaction fees also fixed in the same way should not be any worse, philosophically speaking.  \n\nOn the other hand, having the supply of block space limited by the protokol, below the demand -- *that* would be very typical of a centrally planned economy... ;-)': 1, '> We already have a minimum fee\n\nBut it is too small: 2.5 US cents per simple transaction, at 0.2 mBTC/kB (which is the fee needed to get past the current "test"). My proposal is to increase it so that the *minimum* is at least 5 times more.  That would have made the recent attacks 5 times more expensive.\n\nCharging per kB only makes sens if and while there is a backlog, so that the miners have to solve a knapsack problem to choose what transactions to process. But the whole point of increasing the blocksize limit is to prevent backlogs, that should be avoided like the plague.  \n\nIf there is no backlog -- which, I repeat, should be always the case --, the optimum greedy strategy for each miner is to take *all* the transactions in the queue and put them into his block.  Then it does not matter whether the fees are by kB or by output (which would make the most business sense) or even a flat fee for any tx.  In fact, *every* transaction will be processed in the next block, even if it pays only the minimum fee.': 2}, ("The Bitcoin Network Hashrate: 4803668.71 Petaflops; The fastest supercomputer in the world, China's Tianhe-2: 33.86 Petaflops", 0): {'Ctrl+F Bitcoin\n\nnope': 2, 'The amount of power, time, and energy required to run fiat currency is far worse.

I currently post on Bitcointalk.org as TPTB_need_war.\n\nArmstrong is predicting an acceleration of the sovereign debt contagion as of October (2015.75) outside the USA. This will drive a stampede of safe haven seeking capital into the dollar and the USA stock market, creating a bubble in both that will peak by the next turn in the ECM 2017.9. In the interim until October, the capital has been moving into the short-end of the sovereign bond yield curves, which is setting up the final peak in sovereign bonds globally by October. After that, it will be all dollars, USA stocks as the goto investments. Gold and other private assets (ostensibly including Bitcoin) will finally bottom in Spring 2016 with egregious lows (e.g. < $700 for gold) as everyone piles on short. The bottom for private assets will be due to short covering at these blood-in-the-streets levels.\n\nArmstrong doesn't seem to understand that Bitcoin was designed by the DEEP STATE to help institute electronic currency worldwide, and TPTB love Bitcoin (heck they created it) because it is entirely trackable and will be part of their economic totalitarianism campaign wherein terrorism, money laundering, and tax avoidance will be the excuses to expropriate all private wealth in the their coming global smash up by design to bring the world to a NWO monetary reset and system of top-down control.\n\nThus Armstrong incorrectly sees Bitcoin as a threat to governments, but Armstrong doesn't even agree TPTB have such power to organize. Please see the Martin Armstrong thread in the Economics forum at Bitcointalk.org for more discussion about MA's myopic on TPTB.\n\nI also believe Armstrong subconsciously resists any grass-roots solutions, because:\n\n1. He wants to push his proposals for collectivized equity-for-bonds swaps, which I have criticized for being both impractical and also since investments are not fungible, his proposals resolve basically to more centralization of power amongst the fat cats. His retort has been that the best we can do is cooperate with the politicians and fat cats. Of course I disagree. Fuck them. Let's reset the world in a new grass-roots Knowledge Age instead.\n\n2. His clients are very high networth and I don't think they could fit their existing networth into crypto-currencies. There isn't enough liquidity yet.

But generally speaking, someone from "the public" is just as welcome to walk into a "private" Wal-Mart as he is into a "public" park.\n\nWhen speaking of a traditional "public good" (something like a park), the important questions are: who sets the rules for ("owns") the property, and how did they pay for it? In the case of a "public" park, a \'government\' sets the rules for (owns) the park, and they paid for it by coercing money out of people (who may or may not have wished to pay for it). With a Wal-Mart store, it\'s owned by a company that voluntarily acquired funds, one way or another. Likewise, there are "privately-owned" parks that are fully open to "the public", but that were not funded using coercion ("taxes").\n\nBut none of this makes any sense in the context of Bitcoin.

I italicized it as an alignment to the previous commenter's mood; I see that I should have used quotation marks instead.\n\nThere is a value in your proposal, even if it is not directly enforceable (we are not going to introduce code compiling as a consensus rule, and there is no way to know that the committed code is the one actually run unless we require trusted computing validation).\n\nEven if it is only indicational, voting approaches like yours or prediction markets [as proposed recently](http://redd.it/3dab1h) can help avoiding a consensus schism, which is the worst case scenario.": 1, "> Decentralized =/= Democracy\n\nGloves /= baby powder.\n\nTwo can play at that game!\n\nSeriously though, did you even read it? The decentralization is neither equal to nor derived from the voting. Voting is just a way to not have a central authority. Decentralization is the 'anyone can participate' and 'hosted on the blockchain' bits.": 1, 'I would say, mining is much worse, if you want the decision to be more uniformly spread across more people.\nBitcoin mining power is much more centralized than Bitcoin-Stake.': 1, 'There is no such thing as an informed population, and there never will be.\n\nCentralization is not a terrible thing in and of itself; the worst forms of, say, monopolies are usually the result of government (democratic or otherwise), because that government is \\[increasingly\\] centralized and founded on the principle of violent imposition.': 0, "By definition it's not in your power to either accelerate it or slow it down.": 1, 'If I wasn\'t worried about malicious actors I might have suggested we conduct the whole thing on survey monkey.\n\nLong term manipulation requires constantly burning Bitcoin, which is beyond the capacity of anyone indefinitely. Also, if we tried this, and it didn\'t work, then we can say "*shrug* guess we go back to github". It\'s not ideal, but it is also certainly not a foregone conclusion.\n\nWith this in mind, why would those actors bother at all? Since *we* have very little to lose if an attacker comes along.\n\n': 1, "Delegative democracy is not the kind of democracy you're used to: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delegative_democracy\n\nIt is actually the best idea I've heard for distributed decision making. ": 6, 'Decentralized =/= Democracy': 2, "That's a good question... bitcoin is decentralized by design, but is bitcoin really a democracy? \n\nEvery actor in the bitcoin network plays a role in forming a majority consensus on property ownership based on some predefined rules.  At first glance it does seem similar to an algorithm for democracy, where the majority of people decide what is best for the common good, and tyrants who wish to impose their will have no power to do so.  \n\nThe problem with this idea is that in the digital realm, there are no individuals.  When a majority can be bought with processors, the rich _can_ decide where bitcoin is going.  We assume that rational (economic) self-interest will keep this thing moving along (and so far it's worked out well), but though power may be decentralized, it certainly isn't evenly distributed.  In reality, bitcoin seems more like an algorithm for capitalism, and is completely independent of democracy.\n\nThe interesting thing, however, is that since it is a completely voluntary system then anyone can sell their coins and opt-out.  This is really the only check or balance to the inevitably accumulating power structures within bitcoin, if people don't like the direction it's heading (or if they think it will lose value) then they might stop using it and it will negatively affect the value.  \n\nThis sounds like a fair deal (no one is forcing you to use bitcoin), and in free-market theory you can just move your balance into a better cryptocurrency.  However, the network effect seems to discourage change and innovation for new coins, so it seems that rational people will stick with the bitcoin hegemony and hope that the rising tide lifts their rowboats along with the tankers next to them, as long as the current doesn't crash them all against the shore.": 2, 'I think that might be a consequence of our definitions, then. For me, Bitcoin embodies \'democracy\' and offers a number of serious lessons that are not in any way incorporated into mainstream \'democracy\', both of which are different things. e.g. The only parts of the democratic system that matter to me are 1) its ability to remove bad leaders and bad policy, and 2) the inclusion of as many options as possible. Representativeness or proportionality have nothing to do with a good democracy IMO.\n\nVoting systems themselves don\'t have much to do with democracy in a canonical sense, IMO, and canonical democracy has very little to do with my proposal. Sooooo much butthurt about that word in this thread (not referring to your original comment, further up there is some mad vitriol).\n\nI\'ve come to the conclusion referring to democracy at all was a mistake in the OP, and should have used \'weighted preference graph\' or something instead.\n\n"opt-in weighted preference graph /= decentralization" sounds far more like a nonsequitur than "democracy /= decentralization"': 1, 'Who would be the most incentivized to consult and possibly even delegate their votes to the experts?
