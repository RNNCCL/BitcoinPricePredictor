Bitcoin around 0.6 or 0.8 started to refuse relaying transactions which had an invalid signature (either because of padding added by bitcoind 0.3, or because the signature was not in the expected range which bitcoin started enforcing) but those are still valid in blocks (because the signature is valid).\n\nWhich means an attacker could simply take the pending_tx list from MtGox, find his transaction there, modify it and broadcast it. The network would only see his tx, and once mined by someone (anyone) MtGox would find our own tx to have invalid inputs and will attempt to fix it.\n\nThe network would never see MtGox's initial transaction (since it doesn't get relayed) and I'm afraid you wouldn't either, unless you specifically monitored our pending_tx list.": 1, "I hear you on that!

There is at least one viable proposed alternative, the Lightning model, and it seems reasonable as an unrelated third-party (to Lightning) that it could be implemented before we get close to having issues with the 1 MB block limit. Sidechains do not attempt to address scaling at all.\n\n> Gavin also seems to be claiming that his support for the increase in max block size and to a lesser extent the other changes in XT are a call for action on the part of the Core team to adopt some change to max block size whether set specifically or adaptive as that change on it\'s own is not a deviation from the initial spec of Bitcoin. Surely if that minor change were implemented the risk of a hard fork to XT would be drastically reduced, and it\'s role limited to a a beta branch of Core?\n\nThere is no beta branch of Core in terms of hardforks, and in practical terms *cannot* be (this is the very problem sidechains are intended to address). An accepted change to the consensus rules would have to be deployed by every single Bitcoin node, without exception. Threats of forks are not a rational argument for making a change.\n\n> Regarding the fork, as long as the Core protocol doesn\'t change significantly and XT doesn\'t reach 90% adoption it\'s not going to happen, right?\n\nUnless bigblock-XT reaches 99.999...% adoption, it would become either a "premined" altcoin (if it sustains more miners than Bitcoin) or merely a buggy node implementation (if it fails to acquire miners) at the "hardfork" date.\n\n> Can we get some clarification on the future of the Core - for instance, is Gavin still going to have influence on it?\n\nThis isn\'t really a technical question. I don\'t predict the future.\n\n> I would agree that just allowing the max block size to increase indefinitely is fraught with problems, but problems that are a way down the road and also not a deviation from the Bitcoin whitepaper. \n\nThe Bitcoin whitepaper is not relevant to the direction of Bitcoin. We have no central authorities, so the decision making simply must follow its natural course given the design of the system. That effectively means merchants and exchanges people want to use have the decision on hardforks, and miners have the decisions on softforks. The only thing developers really have a part in, is writing code, giving informed advice/opinions, and deciding to jump ship if people make stupid decisions.\n\n> For that reason I wonder why Blockstream don\'t start their own cryptocurrency to start pegging sidestreams to?\n\nWhy would this make sense? We founded Blockstream to improve Bitcoin, not to make a scamcoin. No amount of good will on the part of the developers of an altcoin can prevent scammers from taking advantage of it for pump and dump. Furthermore, even if we could make an altcoin somehow immune to the scamcoin effect, it would either still fall under the same decision-making nature as Bitcoin (presumably with the same results), or be centralised (which seems pointless).': 3, "> But the debate over the block size limit and how to manage it has caused some of the best known developers to set up another client for bitcoin, here:\n\nBitcoin XT actually predates the block size matter entirely, and was forked by Mike Hearn (*not* a Core developer) to merge some relatively ill-advised things appropriately rejected from Core (because they don't/can't work): particularly, double spend relaying/detection.\n\n> essentially, if you have 1 Bitcoin, after the fork (if you have today's wallet backed up) you will have 1 Bitcoin, and 1 'BitcoinXT', each with independent values based on their popular adoption.\n\nTo complicate matters a bit: if you send 1 BTC, you also send 1 BTCXT, and vice versa.

Sounds like there would be too many variables involved and it could possibly open up new avenues of attack for malevolent or even just selfish participants. \nDecreasing block time, combined with increasing block size while balancing tx/h, bandwidth and propagation issues would do the trick in my opinion. \n\nEven though the block size increase seems to be divisive enough by itself, and this carries the risk of introducing another point of argument with no full consensus behind it, I think it's still worth floating this.
