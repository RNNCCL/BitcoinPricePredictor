So when Bitcoin goes from $1,200 to $200 there is not a vicious cycle of people who need to sell, because they cannot afford to loose more money, that drives the price to zero.\n\nIt is hard to estimate how many people on bitcoins, but it may be somewhere between 13 and 15 million people right now. If Bitcoin is successful we will see hundreds of millions of people own Bitcoin and, eventually, billions. The only way we can get to billions of people owning Bitcoin is by the price going up by several orders of magnitude, let\'s say $ 1 million (but this is highly speculative and risky). So, if I am right, and Bitcoin has to go from $390 to $1,000,000 the best way for it to get there without crashing irreversibly is with as much volatility as possible. If bitcoin went up a couple percentage points every week and everybody began to think about it as a "sure" thing, investing money that was destined to pay for kids colleges or for retirement, that is a disaster waiting to happen price wise. Because when Bitcoin corrects those people have to sell because they cannot take more losses, potentially creating a vicious circle which is hard to reverse.\n\nIronically, we have to thank Bitcoin\'s volatility for people not investing money they cannot afford to loose.

These opinions and statements are my own.\n\nThe article seems to accidentally mis-represent where we are with Bitcoin and Web Payments. Many of us have been trying to get the Bitcoin community involved for a number of years in the Web Payments work:\n\nhttp://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/networks/whos-who-in-bitcoin-web-payments-wunderkind-manu-sporny\n\nFor example, Pindar Wong has undertaken a Herculean effort over the last year to get more involvement from Bitcoin organizations through the Blockchain Workshops as well as the Scaling Bitcoin Workshops:\n\nhttps://scalingbitcoin.org/hongkong2015/#workshop\n\nThe direction of the W3C Web Payments work is set by the participants. Currently, there are zero Bitcoin organizations involved in the Web Payments work. There are zero core Bitcoin developers engaged in the Web Payments work. I put the text around Bitcoin in the specifications to demonstrate that the approach we are taking is generalized enough to support Bitcoin and in the hope that Bitcoin organizations would notice and start participating. If there are no Bitcoin companies participating, the most likely outcome at present is that those examples will be stripped out of the specification as it works its way through the standardization process. We can't keep Bitcoin examples that haven't been vetted by experts and that don't have implementations behind them.\n\nThe status of Bitcoin in the Web Payments work is far more precarious than many of the people commenting on the article think.

To an extent it always has been because of how Bitcoin was designed. But what's different this time is people are finding their national currency is being devalued and they're afraid.\n\nAnother way of looking at it is the difference between having your money in the bank and spending it electronically (debit cards) and deciding to withdraw your money and only spend cash. People are becoming wary of banks all over the world. Greece was a good reason when you saw the limits the banks placed on withdrawing cash.\n\nAnother reason being in Bitcoin is good is because there are few places to make your money grow. I live in the U.S. where the interest rate has been 0% for years. I can't get any interest on putting my money into savings, bonds, or CDs. There isn't any investment opportunity from having my money in Federal Reserve Notes. \n\nBitcoin in my opinion is also rising because of all the other bubbles. Right now we have a stock market bubble, a commodities bubble, a housing bubble, a credit bubble, a car bubble, a student loan bubble, a tech bubble. Just about every financial market has hit their highs and there's no more opportunity to get a return on investment. \n\nCorporate stock buybacks are at an all time high. These fools broke the first rule of investing when they decided to buy high and sell low. It's complete incompetence in investing.": 5, 'The first rule of investing is buy low sell high. The U.S. stock market is way over valued. Corporations have been taking their profits and buying their own stock to boost their stock prices. They are buying high in an overvalued market. The only place they have to go is down. The stock market can\'t rise forever and it\'s at the peak.\n\nMeanwhile they are starving their own businesses because of focusing on shareholder\'s profits. They are not investing in hiring employees or increasing wages. This is a bad idea.\n\nHenry Ford had a thesis called welfare capitalism. He paid is workers an incredibly high wage for a good purpose. He wanted his workers to be able to afford his cars. The biggest mistake of corporations not investing in their workforce is their workers can\'t afford to buy their products.\n\nTake for example Walmart, they are losing billions right now. The founder Sam Walton practiced Henry Ford\'s welfare capitalism model. He paid his workers a very generous wage. In return his workers were able to shop at his store. He invested his money in his workforce and they invest that money right back into his business in the form of increased profits.

The blockchain will revolutionize this market over the next few years. Collateral kept in escrow is locked by a multi-sig wallet and provides proof of solvency. Counter parties can still settle directly, and only if one of them is incorrigible does a trusted third-party need to step in. This reduces friction and eliminates the need to trust a third party collateral manager. The solvency of Lehman and Bear Sterns during the last financial crisis was due in large part to over leverage on CDS - a form of OTC derivative.\n\n2) End the Fed -- The way banking works today will soon (hopefully) become a thing of the past. The justification for the Fed is to provide a lender of last resort. Bitcoin eliminates the propensity for fractional reserve banking, and thus eliminates the justification for that relic of an institution. Banking will truly be segregated between custodial, which charge a fee for a service (think Coinbase), and investment, which offer modest interest payments by amortizing risk (similar to a CD in traditional banking). The latter will hopefully be dominated by p2p matching services.\n\nd) Contracts and Deeds -- Birth certificates, company shares, the deed to your house, and business contracts will all be recorded on the blockchain and provably signed by your private key. This will simplify transference of these assets, reduce the burden on government for record keeping, and continue to effect us in ways we could never predict.\n\nWelcome to the Moon!': 1}, ('Crypto locker bandits demand payment by bitcoin.', 1): {"I'm not sure what the limits are but you can purchase bitcoins more or less instantly through Circle with a debt card": 1, "From what I've read the Cryptolocker bandits give the keys on payment.
