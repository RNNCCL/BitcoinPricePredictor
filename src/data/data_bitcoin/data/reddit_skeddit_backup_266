BitTorrent is not a financially incentivized network. People don't get paid for sharing files or seeding, and don't really have incentives to knock 'competing nodes' off of the network. The same is not necessarily true for OB.\n\nIf OB decides to use a DHT, then the threat model presented by OB will have to include all of the vulnerabilities introduced by the DHT. And that will need to be accompanied by some analysis explaining why these vulnerabilities are insufficiently incentivized or protected against.\n\n> Also it seems you don't understand how these networks work. The GUID can either be computationally expensive (like we designed) or not (like BitTorrent); either way the user needs a GUID. \n\nThat's ad hominem followed by a false dichotomy. The OB threat model is currently depending on the idea that GUIDs are expensive for attackers to acquire, but the method of making GUIDs expensive doesn't actually make them expensive for the attacker (due to specialized hardware). A better scheme would involve something like burning Bitcoins (which have a more universal cost - hashing is definitely not the same price for everybody).\n\n> At least in OB, there is a marketplace for Moderators who can publish dispute resolution guides so both the Buyer and Vendor can take whatever steps necessary to maximise the chance of a dispute resolving in their favour. \n\nA marketplace where attackers have strong incentives to make fake moderators to execute scams. The article does not discuss how these moderators are selected, but that is a very important step.\n\n> Not really. Many people who say this don't appreciate how easy it is to give yourself fake ratings in centralised marketplaces. Moreover, you can pay $100 to get a bunch of fake reviews from India or South America. In these platforms, the source and destination of funds is veiled to the public and to some degree the platform. In short you will have zero indication whether someone is paying themselves for fake goods to have fake ratings. \n\nCentralized marketplaces have tools that can help. For example, they can require merchants to provide a government-issued identity. They can seek legal action against scammers and false vendors. They can go back in time and reverse a transaction if they realize that they made a mistake. They can ban people.\n\n> In short you will have zero indication whether someone is paying themselves for fake goods to have fake ratings. \n\nYou as the consumer may not have this information, but the centralized marketplace itself does have this information. Furthermore, the centralized marketplace has well established and highly reputable moderators - themselves. A marketplace that has terrible reputation does not get used. I'm not saying that centralized marketplaces have all of the problems solved - merchants and consumers alike still get scammed on places like Ebay. But I am saying that Ebay has a lot more tools at its disposal for dealing with the problems than does OB.\n\n> However, there real risk is collusion between one party and a fake Moderator.

There is money to be made by manipulating the DHT. Byzantine DHTs do exist, but are very expensive, and iirc make some important tradeoffs (like having strong restrictions on who is allowed to join the DHT).\n\n> The GUID is generated using a proof-of-work scheme to introduce computational difficulty in generating identities, to mitigate against a variety of sock-puppet attacks. With the target difficulty, GUID generation should take approximately 30 seconds.\n\nThis is a mistake. Attackers can use specialized hardware to generate GUIDs that won't be available to your average merchants and users. We see this already with Bitcoin mining. We saw it happen to Litecoin mining too, even though that was supposed to be 'GPU resistant' and later 'ASIC resistant'. It's neither. If OB grows substantially, you can expect attackers to be able to generate GUIDS 100s or 1000s of times as efficiently as merchants and miners. This can be used to set up sybil attacks.\n\n> There are some prior steps regarding Moderator selection that won\xe2\x80\x99t be elaborated on in this article\n\nThat's an incredibly important step. An honest vendor or buyer who gets stuck with a malicious moderator and counterparty is going to lose.\n\nBut further, how is a moderator supposed to know who to side with? What if the vendor produces proof of shipment and the user claims the package had rocks? Many times, the moderators are not going to be in a position of knowing who is right and who is wrong.\n\nAnd, how do external parties determine if a moderator has acted correctly?

The article does not seem to make any substantial progress on either problem. Sybil reputation is a large number of 'fake' accounts all participating in the economy in a convincing way, and interacting with eachother to falsely boost reputation. Then this false reputation can be used to scam real users. Exit scams happen when people retire. When you retire, there is no incentive for you to maintain good reputation, in fact you may as well get yourself a good retirement bonus by committing a series of large exit scams. Your reputation will drain, but that's irrelevant because you are retired.\n\nThe article mentions the potential use of analytical tools to detect sybil reputation. In practice, many sybil attacks have strong patterns and are easily analyzed *in hindsight*. If the analytical tools are being used for attack prevention, and the tools are open source, then we can expect more sophisticated sybil attacks which are resistant to whatever types of analysis are being performed in real time. Even if the sybil attacks are still easily recognizable in hindsight, it is difficult to spot them live because the attackers know the common methods used to detect sybil attacks and can construct their attacks to specifically avoid detection. I do not think that analytical tools will ever be sufficient to detect and prevent sybil reputation.\n\nThe article does not mention exit scams at all.": 6, "Time penalties don't solve the super high parallelism problem.

To start, it is the case that the public key of any Bitcoin private key is generated by multiplying by the generator, and thus directly corresponds to the private key. The public key is then hashed to give the Bitcoin address.\n\nThere are two parties, one who does the mixing (mixing peers) and one who sends their funds to be mixed (input peers).\n\nUsing a distributed, dealerless secret sharing scheme using polynomials (think Shamir's Secret Sharing), every person doing mixing (mixing peer) generates a fragment of a private key. The private fragment is then used to generate a public fragment, which is distributed to every single other person mixing. With each mixing person having all the public fragments, they can reassemble the public key and hash it to get the escrow addresses Ti for each input peer. \n\nThese addresses Ti are sent to people who want their coins mixed (input peers) and the input peers verify themselves that they indeed were all given the same address, as there is a unique Ti for every input peer and each mixing peer should know it. These persons send their coins in identical denominations to address Ti in separate transactions. The input peers also send an encrypted form of their receiving addresses to the people doing the mixing, who then decrypt and shuffle them using a decentralized, secure method. It is ensured that while that while the mixing peers possess each address, they do know which address belongs to which input peer.\n\nFinally, the mixing peers collaborate to produce a number of transactions equal to the number of input peers spending one input from the initial escrow phase to one decoded output address given by an input peer. Each of these transactions, with an input from address Ti, is signed by a distributed method (sometimes called a 'threshold signature') and then broadcast to the network, giving each input peer an amount equal to their original inputs but with an unknown origin.\n\nIn effect, for n input peers you get n transactions to various Ti and then n transactions from Ti to an input peer's address, for a total of 2n transactions on the network.": 6, "A T for each.\n\nSo, from the reading of the paper I'm guessing that by specifying Qi/Ti they do mean that for each input peer, a unique public key Qi/address Ti can be made.\n\nI edited the wording a bit for my post to make this clearer.": 1, 'Thank you for the update.

However, Bitcoin\xe2\x80\x99s promise of anonymity is broken as recent work shows how Bitcoin\xe2\x80\x99s blockchain exposes users to reidentification and linking attacks. In consequence, different mixing services have emerged which promise to randomly mix a user\xe2\x80\x99s Bitcoins with other users\xe2\x80\x99 coins to provide anonymity based on the unlinkability of the mixing. However, proposed approaches suffer either from weak security guarantees and single points of failure, or small anonymity sets and missing deniability.\n\n> In this paper, we propose CoinParty a novel, decentralized mixing service for Bitcoin based on a combination of decryption mixnets with threshold signatures. CoinParty is secure against malicious adversaries and the evaluation of our prototype shows that it scales easily to a large number of participants in real-world network settings. By the application of threshold signatures to Bitcoin mixing, CoinParty achieves anonymity by orders of magnitude higher than related work as we quantify by analyzing transactions in the actual Bitcoin blockchain, and is first among related approaches to provide plausible deniability.\n\n*Conclusion*:\n> Different works successfully attacked anonymity of Bitcoin addresses by analyzing transactions in the blockchain [2,22,25,26,29]. Those works make evident the necessity of mixing services and several such systems have been recently proposed [9,20,28]. However, a detailed analysis reveals dis- advantages with each of those systems (Sections 3 and 6).\n\n> In this paper, we have thus presented CoinParty, a novel mixing service for Bitcoins that improves significantly over the related work by combining the advantages of centralized and decentralized mixes in a single system. CoinParty achieves this by employing two existing building blocks, i.e., threshold ECDSA [17] and decryption mixnets [12,28]. We introduce several modifications that improve on robustness, anonymity, and deniability that are relevant also beyond the scope of our work. Importantly, we show by analyzing the actual Bitcoin blockchain how our single transaction pattern provides anonymity by orders of magnitude higher than what is achieved by the group transaction pattern that the majority of related work depends on. An extensive evaluation of our implemented prototype demonstrates that CoinParty scales better than related work, e.g., [28], due to the possible separation of input and mixing peers. The threshold ECDSA scheme implemented as part of the prototype is efficient and secure against malicious adversaries and can be used beyond our work, e.g., for securing Bitcoin wallets.': 5, 'Well, the whitepaper is definitely a good start, but they would need to test the code in order to make the assertions they made in their research. So there is definitely code, but whether or not its public yet is the question.\n\nTry to stay positive, the world moves forward, just not always as fast as we want it.': 2, 'I\xe2\x80\x99m the author of the discussed paper and would like to clarify the raised points and questions.\n\n**I\xe2\x80\x99ll start with CoinParty\xe2\x80\x99s transaction pattern.**\n\n* If we have *n* users in the mixing, they will each in an individual transaction, referred to as commitment, transfer the required mixing amount *v* to an individual escrow address, denoted *T_i* in the paper.\nNote that these commitments can have any number of inputs and outputs, as long as at least *v* Bitcoin are transferred to the escrow address (which is only known to the user and the mix peers).\n* After all commitments are received, the escrowed funds are transferred to the users\xe2\x80\x99 shuffled output addresses, again in one individual transaction per user.\n\nTo sum this up in a crude diagram, what we end up with is the following transaction pattern:\n\n    TX_1: I_1 \xe2\x80\x94> T_1 \xe2\x80\x94> O_pi(1)\n    TX_2: I_2 \xe2\x80\x94> T_2 \xe2\x80\x94> O_pi(2)\n                    ...\n    TX_n: I_n \xe2\x80\x94> T_n \xe2\x80\x94> O_pi(n)\n\nHere, *I_i* are the users\xe2\x80\x99 input adresses, *T_i* the individual escrow addresses and *O_pi(i)* the shuffled output addresses, where *pi* is a permutation that is not known to anyone, not even the mix peers.\n\n**Moving on to CoinParty\xe2\x80\x99s security model & guarantees**\n\nThe commitments are just standard Bitcoin transactions, there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing to discuss here.\nThe private key corresponding to the escrow addresses, however, is shared among the mix peers using a Secret Sharing Scheme.\nThis essentially means that mix peers have to collaborate to do anything with these private keys.\nAnd indeed, the transactions of the second phase (T_i \xe2\x80\x94> O_pi(i)) are signed using a threshold signature scheme that is collaboratively carried out by the mix peers.\n\nNow, regarding these threshold transactions there are two important questions\n\n* *Security*: How many malicious mix peers need to collaborate to produce a valid signature in order to steal funds from the escrow addresses?\n* *Robustness*: How many malicious mix peers need to collaborate to stop the honest peers from successfully completing the protocol and thereby get funds stuck in the escrow addresses?\n\nDiving deeper in to the underlying theoretic basis of secure multiparty computation (for the interested, I recommend [0]), one realizes quickly that the two properties, *security* and *robustness*, are caught in a tradeoff. I won\xe2\x80\x99t go further into this here, but will only give you the hard numbers.\nCoinParty strikes a balance that tolerates 1/3 of the *m* mix peers to be malicious, in particular this means\n\n* **>= m/3 malicious mix peers can steal** funds but they all need to collaborate to do so.\n* **>= m/3 malicious mix peers can stop** the protocol without coordinated collaboration after the commitments were received, such that funds get stuck.\n* Note that the first point implies that we can tolerate < 2/3 of the mix peers to fail randomly, i.e., without actively interfering with the protocol afterwards.\n\nIncreasing the threshold in one direction, e.g., providing security against more malicious peers, will always decrease the threshold in the other direction, e.g., it will take less malicious peers to cause the protocol to stop and funds get stuck.\nSince, we weigh both consequences, funds getting stolen and funds getting stuck, equally, the 1/3-threshold is the best we can do in our approach.\nThis is confirmed by well-established feasibility results in the domain of secure multiparty computation (cf. [0] \xc2\xa72.1)\n\nOn a side note, the threshold becomes more favorable, i.e. m/2, if you assume a semi-honest attacker, i.e., an attacker how adheres to the protocol and does not actively try to sabotage it. However, we really think that the semi-honest adversary model is too weak in the context of Bitcoin, where attackers have monetary incentives to cheat the protocol in every way they can.\n\n\n**Source code**\n\nWe have implemented a prototype of CoinParty as proposed in [1] based on the VIFF framework [2]. As we realized later, VIFF is not really secure against malicious adversaries on an implementation level. Note that this is independent of the concept and protocols we propose in [1].\nHowever, we scrapped the VIFF-based and set out to reimplement CoinParty more rigorously. Along the way, we also made some protocol-level improvements that will be published soon. We\'re planning to release the source code when this is finished. \n\nAt this point, a short disclaimer is probably appropriate: Being a research institute, we are not aiming for production-grade code, nor do we have the skills or resources to do so.\n\n**References**\n\n[0] Lindell, Yehuda, and Benny Pinkas.

This would make it easy as a wallet provider to follow that txid to see when your transaction is included in a block.\nThis is all great and works well(ish).\nAs I understand it there is a gotcha.  The signature of a transaction is given as two numbers (r,s). Unfortunately another perfectly valid signature is (r,-s).  This means whilst an attacker can't(edit predictive sex mistake)  resign or modify the actual transaction, they can copy/paste it and modify s to be -s.  When you hash this transaction you'll now get a different value, ie a different txid.\nThis screws up wallets that don't account for this.\n\nThere is probably ore to this but that's my understanding.  In expect it's tricky to solve because both Bitcoin protocol and wallets need to be updated. Bitcoin protocol can help prevent s being -s by preventing relaying -s transactions. This isn't enough however as a malicious or old miner may still accept -s in a block.

Previously, all four were large purchasers of U.S. debt.\n\nWhile central banks have been selling, a large swath of other buyers has stepped in, including U.S. and foreign firms. That buying, driven in large part by worries about the world\xe2\x80\x99s economic outlook, has helped keep bond yields at low levels from a historical standpoint.\n\nBut many investors say the reversal in central-bank Treasury purchases stands to increase price swings in the long run. It could also pave the way for higher yields when the global economy is on firmer footing, they say.\n\nCentral-bank purchases over the past decade are widely perceived to have \xe2\x80\x9chelped depress the long-term Treasury bond yields,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stephen Jen, managing partner at SLJ Macro Partners LLP and a former economist at the International Monetary Fund. \xe2\x80\x9cNow, we have sort of a reverse situation.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nForeign official net sales of U.S. Treasury debt maturing in at least a year hit $123 billion in the 12 months ended in July, said Torsten Slok, chief international economist at Deutsche Bank Securities, citing Treasury Department data. It was the biggest decline since data started to be collected in 1978. A year earlier, foreign central banks purchased $27 billion of U.S. notes and bonds.\n\nIn the past decade, large trade surpluses or commodity revenues permitted many emerging-market countries to accumulate large foreign-exchange reserves. Many purchased U.S. debt because the Treasury market is the most liquid and the U.S. dollar is the world\xe2\x80\x99s reserve currency.\n\nForeign official purchases rose as high as a net $230 billion in the year ended in January 2013, the Deutsche Bank data show.\n\nBut as global economic growth weakened, commodity prices slumped and the dollar rose in anticipation of expected Federal Reserve interest-rate increases, capital flowed out of emerging economies, forcing some central banks to raise cash to buy their local currencies.\n\nIn recent months, China\xe2\x80\x99s central bank in particular has stepped up its selling of Treasurys.\n\nThe People\xe2\x80\x99s Bank of China surprised investors by devaluing the yuan on Aug. 11. The heavy selloff that followed\xe2\x80\x94triggered by concerns that Beijing would permit more weakening of the yuan to help spur growth\xe2\x80\x94caught officials at the central bank somewhat off guard, according to people close to the central bank.\n\nTo contain the selloff, the PBOC has been buying yuan and selling dollars to prevent the yuan from weakening beyond around 6.40 per dollar, according to the people.\n\nData published Wednesday showed China\xe2\x80\x99s foreign-exchange reserves dwindled further in September, a trend that likely will force the country\xe2\x80\x99s central bank to step up monetary easing. The PBOC said currency reserves fell $43.3 billion last month to $3.51 trillion as more funds left the country, the fifth consecutive monthly drop but a less-sharp one than the record $93.9 billion plunge the previous month.\n\nInternal estimates at the PBOC show that it spent between $120 billion and $130 billion in August alone in bolstering the yuan\xe2\x80\x99s value, according to people close to the central bank.\n\nChina, the biggest foreign owner of Treasury securities, owned $1.241 trillion Treasury debt at the end of July, down from a record of $1.317 trillion in November 2013, according to the latest data available from the Treasury.\n\nChina isn\xe2\x80\x99t alone. Russia\xe2\x80\x99s holdings of all U.S. Treasury debt fell by $32.8 billion in the year ended in July, according to the latest data available from the U.S. Treasury. Taiwan\xe2\x80\x99s holdings dropped by $6.8 billion. Norway, a developed nation hit by the oil-price decline, reduced its Treasury holdings by $18.3 billion.\n\nSome other central banks increased holdings. India increased its Treasury debt holdings to $116.3 billion at the end of July 2015 from $79.7 billion a year ago. The Federal Reserve held $2.45 trillion of Treasury debt at the end of September and isn\xe2\x80\x99t expected to sell U.S. debt soon.\n\nTraders said China\xe2\x80\x99s selling has been a factor in why 10-year Treasury yields have remained near 2% as stock and commodity markets tumbled in recent months. The yield fell as low as 1.6% before the so-called taper tantrum in mid-2013 as the Fed prepared to end monthly bond purchases.\n\nThe 10-year yield settled at 2.061% Wednesday, compared with 2.173% at the end of 2014 and 3.03% at the end of 2013. Yields fall as prices rise.\n\nSome analysts have warned for years that persistent fiscal deficits made the U.S. Treasury market vulnerable to a reduction in foreign purchases.

Hit me up for any questions and I will be more than happy to help you think this through.\n\nThe ball is now in your court.": 2, '2 year lurker here, very interested in this idea and had to leave some feedback.\n\nFirst of all, you really seem to be onto something.  I notice, however, that you\'ve received very little attention for this, mainly due to the way it\'s presented.  Your kickstarter video and descriptions read more like a tutorial than a business pitch, so your idea is going right over the heads of 99% of viewers.  I would imagine it\'s hard for people to see the vision of your technology, much less how they\'re going to make a return off investing in you.\n\nAs an engineer myself, I know that it\'s tough to explain the value of innovative technologies to non-technically-minded people, so here are some business-oriented questions you must answer in order to find more success with fundraising:\n\n-Who is your target market?  I know you said "the list is endless," but give me ONE SPECIFIC example of where this could make an impact if it were on the market TODAY.  The intent here is not just to provide an example of where your idea COULD work, but to show us a plan for where your idea WILL work, ASAP.  That\'s much more compelling and easier to wrap my mind around.\n\n-When will you start making enough money to pay back the 30,000GBP investment needed to develop your product?  Software and technology get developed all the time for the sake of just developing-- prove to us that your idea isn\'t just a \'solution looking for a problem\' by showing a defensible timeline for when customers will start flocking to you.\n\n-Is Bitcoin widely used enough for this to be an effective anticounterfeiting tool?  How many businesses even accept Bitcoin, much less use them as their primary record for transactions/inventory/etc?  I am a hardcore believer that Bitcoin will be used for all these things in the future, but not within 5 years-- and as the saying goes in the startup world, \'being too early is the same as being wrong.\'  Perhaps finding a small-scale supply chain that has already embraced Bitcoin or other cryptos will go a long way toward answering my first question.\n\n-Building off that last one, how will you grow beyond the initial target market to start serving companies who maybe aren\'t sold on the whole Bitcoin thing?  I\'m of the opinion that BTC will gain the most widespread adoption when people don\'t even know they\'re using it.  Everyone\'s already too busy taking care of their problems-- paying rent, finding a parking spot, passing that next exam.  Nobody is going to take the time to learn about XPubKeys and BIP32 in order to check whether that pair of shoes in the store is authentic.  But if you find a way to push all of that to the background with a compelling, simple app (or enterprise software, etc), the floodgates will open.\n\nAll that said, I\'m happy to give you more feedback and wish you luck in this.  Once you\'ve got an actionable business plan together, I recommend you re-list on Kickstarter, or better yet, on some crypto crowdfunding / lending community, like BitLendingClub or BTCJam.  Anyone else know of other good fundraising platforms / websites?': 2, 'Android app now available for testing.': 1, "I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:\n\n- [/r/3dprinting] [CRYPTOPROOF - Counterfeit Detection and Proof of Origin \xe2\x80\xa2 \\/r\\/Bitcoin](https://np.reddit.com/r/3Dprinting/comments/3sij4h/cryptoproof_counterfeit_detection_and_proof_of/)\n\n[](#footer)*^(If you follow any of the above links, please respect the rules of reddit and don't vote in the other threads.) ^\\([Info](/r/TotesMessenger) ^/ ^[Contact](/message/compose?to=/r/TotesMessenger))*\n\n[](#bot)": 1, "Let me first of all say that you are the first person in the last six months to give me some real feedback regarding this tech and I cannot express my thanks enough.\n\n\nI do suspect, as you mention, that much of the audience so far has misunderstood the project, some of the questions I receive on bitcointalk are not relevant to the sites functionality. I hope to continue to improve how it is presented but my main focus at this early stage is making the site work and everything else has mostly taken a back seat thus far.\n\nThe kickstarter video for instance really is a tutorial and not a business pitch.\n\n\n-Who is my target market?\n\nIn my opinion this technology has most potential regarding 3D printed products in whichever form they may take. A realistic solution to detecting cloned products which 3D printers will be able to recreate perfectly has not yet been proposed to my knowledge and it was this point which was forefront in my mind when I began developing the system.\n\n\n-When will you start making enough money to pay back the 30,000GBP?\n\nTo be quite honest I wasn't planning to pay back anything. I was hoping for the crowd to realise the potential benefit to society as a whole and donate.\n\n\n-Is Bitcoin widely used enough for this to be an effective anti-counterfeiting tool?\n\nI would say yes to this because the fact that the subkeys, or rather 'sub-serial numbers' are also valid addresses on the BTC network is irrelevant if all you are interested in is product origin or counterfeit detection.\n\nAs more BTC services appear then the more relevant BTC becomes and so the Bitcoin aspect will hopefully become a self fulfilling prophecy over time.\n\n\n-How will you grow beyond the initial target market to start serving companies who maybe aren't sold on the whole Bitcoin thing?\n\nGetting people to listen in the first place in order to explain what benefits the site offers is the hardest part, for this I need publicity and for publicity I need funding. I have consolidated all the relevant software on the user side into docker containers with copy and paste commands and a video tutorial for simplicity but still a learning curve remains. I am working on the android app right now and will continue to think of new ways to make cryptoproof more comprehensible to the lay person as development continues.
