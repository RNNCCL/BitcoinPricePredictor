Zero-conf is risky, but manageable. It's an entrepreneurial and technical challenge to come up with ways for merchants-as-clients (of, e.g., BitPay, BlockCypher) to accept zero-conf with reasonable certainty. We shouldn't just eliminate zero-conf for everyone when it is successfully utilized today.\n\nThat being said, if a strong enough case can be made for the other advantages of RBF (and newbie mistake recovery isn't enough, in my opinion), then Opt-in RBF (< max value nSequence) will adequately preserve existing zero-conf utilization once we get through a potentially hazardous transition period for a minority of merchants.": 5, "That's an excellent clarification.

The majority of businesses using BitPay or Coinbase will probably not have to worry much about it since those PSPs should be all over this before 0.12 is actually released. Other PSPs and even regular wallet developers should, likewise, make RBF detection and UX alert / rejection a priority.\n\nNot only is there a scam risk placed on those merchants who don't upgrade in time, but everyone else will likely deal with the odd rejection now and then from some bitcoin user who doesn't know better. This may make Bitcoin, overall, seem less reliable.": 1, '>Also, any RBF violates your privacy since when you replace a transaction, its new version gets broadcasted and the observer can compare your outputs.  \n\nYou are correct.

It makes it impractical to take BTC in brick and mortar stores without BitPay or some other company converting it immediately to dollars.

Now the attacker can leave the store and has a few minutes before he can launch a replace by fee that nodes and miners will now accept.  RBF basically enables more fraud and scams for very little benefit.  It basically makes bitcoin less attractive to businesses, because of extra training and keeping track of changes in the bitcoin technology.\n\nIf I had a business and the core developers changed this, I would never take bitcoin and hold it.

The idea that you are somehow against socialism, and yet for bitcoin, makes absolutely no sense, and is likely because you are seriously misunderstanding what socialism is. What do you think decentralized networks are? What do you think bitcoin mining is? It is those who own the means of production (their mining equipment), operating said infrastructure through mining, and then reaping the benefits of their labor. There is literally no difference between the nature of a decentralized network/Bitcoin miners and factory workers owning the machinery, operating said machines, and enjoying the fruits of their labor. You cannot be for decentralized networks, and against the principles of socialism. Socialism =/= "big government programs", despite what the McCarthy-era propaganda says. It means that those who labor are afforded the same degree of political and economic rights as those who own via partial ownership of the means of production and direct representation in the operation of said infrastructure through direct democracy. Socialism is literally the decentralization of the market. \n\nAnd just the same, you may want to pick up Robert Reich\'s "Saving Capitalism" or Joseph Stiglitz\'s "Rewriting the Rules of the American Economy." There *is no such thing* as a free market, because markets are structured, operated and maintained through rules which must be decided upon and enforced. You cannot have a market without a government to legislate the market into existence. Markets need to have rules about what can be sold/owned, how much of a market share a single company can own, what happens when one party can\'t pay the other, and it needs to have a system of enforcing the rules. It doesn\'t matter if said government is a representative democracy or the market is enforced on a peer-to-peer basis through voluntary acceptance - markets need rules, and governments decide them. In the case of Bitcoin, it just happens to be that the code itself replaces the function of the state, and the minors can opt in or out of the market at any given time.\n\nAnd just for the record, it is capitalism and the *free market* that has produced the highest record of income inequality since the 1920\'s, which my generation is currently living through. There is a difference between supporting Bitcoin and the decentralization of power, and supporting the rampant exploitation of capitalism that produces the wealth you\'re enamored with.

If it was fully centralized, we'd have one miner producing 100% of the blocks via one node. If is was fully decentralized we'd have every participant having an equal chance of finding each block. At the moment we are somewhere between the two, much much nearer the fully centralized end of the scale.\n\nThe question is, I think, how much decentralization, or censorship-resistance, is required?": 1, "So, what you are saying is that hard forks are dangerous because they don't have consensus, and they don't have consensus because they are dangerous?": 6, "That wasn't nice.": 2, "Not really because 75% should effectively still be a supermajority of support.

We\'re not by any means done, but there\'s probably only room for a small, single digit multiplier when we add together all the potential stuff being talked about today.\n\nWe can debate about whether 2MB, 4MB, or 8MB is safe with the current network. But what\'s needed for the every-human-being-on-the-block-chain, moonshot case is gigabytes or more per block, if everything were on-chain. We are simply never going to get there with software and hardware improvements alone: it\'s just not possible. I don\'t see any pathway for doing so that doesn\'t involve unreasonable assumptions.\n\nSo we want to support every person in the world making every transaction with Bitcoin, but we know we can\'t put all that information on the chain directly. So we need some way to scale that capacity off-chain while preserving or even improving upon ALL the same user-protecting properties that an on-chain transaction has. It is this kind of thinking that led to payment channels and the Lightning network.\n\nThe word "settlement" has become loaded, so I\'ll try a different phrasing. Here in the 1st world we have contracts for just about everything, and courts of law to handle disputes about them. But not every contract is executed in a court by a judge -- only the exceptoinal cases. Imagine if every time you bought a coffee from Starbucks, Starbucks had to take you to court to claim their $5. I don\'t have to tell you that wouldn\'t work! You\'d need more lawyers and judges than there are people on the planet.\n\nBut right now every single transaction is being settled by block chain arbitration. What we imagine, with Lightning, is a world where only the exceptional cases -- where one or both parties see a contract as broken -- are arbitrated on the block chain. When Alice pays Bob there\'s no reason for that to hit the chain unless Alice tries to double-spend, or Bob claims the payment didn\'t happen, or other such failure mode. We imagine a world where every non-contentious payment can happen off-chain, and the on-chain transactions are mainly used for administrative stuff like setting up channels or making one-time large payements to/from cold storage. *This* is a vision that can scale -- using the courts and arbitration of the block chain only in the infrequent occasion of dispute (e.g. counterparty went offline and I want my coins back) and administrative trivia.\n\nNow the connection to "need big blocks now!" is that scaling to bigger blocks is a de facto one-way street: once we increase the block size it will be like pulling teeth to get it back down again. We *know* that we need to transition to an active fee market. We *know* that below a certain price point we are going to have to move transactions off-chain if they are to process at all. We *know* that a whole heck of a lot of infrastructure will have to be updated to make this happen. And we also know, with certainty from past experience, that if we just say this loudly nothing will happen -- because nothing did happen when we had these debates a the soft-limits of 50kB, 100kB, and 250kB. Blocks actually have to get full before wallets and service operators respond :\\ So let\'s coordinate to make the changes we need to make now while we still have a buffer zone -- if something goes wrong we can still do an emergency bump to 2MB or 4MB and the sky won\'t fall. It\'s just basic belts-and-suspenders engineering to make sure that we don\'t have disruptive events when there is absolutely no excess capacity left to respond with.': 3, "Not what I meant to say, but that's probably the underlying dilemma, yes.\n\nI think the danger of hardforks in the current environment is existent, but blown out of proportion and it doesn't make sense to procrastinate here.

It makes sense if bitcoin becomes a settlement layer.

The problem, I guess, is that this conflicts with guys like Coinbase and people who want to scale on the main chain so that they can run their businesses too.\n\nMark is winning (imo) for two reasons: 1. His tech doesn\'t require a hard fork or controversial changes. Just some OP_Codes and soft-fork changes to Bitcoin Core. 2. His tech won\'t scale "on bitcoin". It scales "off bitcoin". So once he gets the changes on Bitcoin core, he can start deploying his tech (lightening, sidechains).\n\nFollowing that logic, a block size increase is not in the best interest of Mark.

Anyone can force responsibility on anyone else in almost any system. People drop shit into other peoples laps all the time. It happens in life.

You would be ignoring the rampant censorship in this sub that has disallowed talk of competing software.\nAnd look where that has landed us. Now, in a scenario where the core maintainers have a higher authority than what they even themselves admit is appropriate, we cannot even discuss alternative implementations. This to me further hardens the case that it is imperative for the core maintainers to provide more options to the users so that we may actually get to chose which software we run instead of the cabal deciding for us, and also for the moderators of this forum to discontinue this abhorrent censorship of an agenda that must be discussed.': 1, 'When it comes to the consensus protocol/rules, the economy (merchants and especially creators) have all the power.
