Also, the bar indicator seems to show you have *already* used up your entire $2,500 weekly buy quota.  \n\nBut I\'ll try to answer your question as best as I understand it. When you buy from Circle, the price for the BTC you get is locked in at the time of purchase. So if you buy $2,500 when all of your weekly quota is available, you\'ll get BTC at the price when you submitted that purchase, but there\'ll be no more purchase quota avaiable for you to buy until the next week, so you would *not* be able to purchase at subsequent different BTC prices. On the other hand, if you buy *less* than the quota amount so that some quota remains, then you could use the remaining quota to buy at different prices throughout the week, until your quota refreshes the next week.

VerSum clients ensure that the output is correct by comparing the outputs from multiple servers. VerSum assumes that at least one server is honest, and crucially, when servers disagree, VerSum uses an efficient conflict resolution protocol to determine which server(s) made a mistake and thus obtain the correct output.\n>\n> VerSum\xe2\x80\x99s contribution lies in achieving low server-side overhead for both incremental re-computation and conflict resolution, using three key ideas: (1) representing the computation as a functional program, which allows memoization of previous results; (2) recording the evaluation trace of the functional program in a carefully designed computation history to help clients determine which server made a mistake; and (3) introducing a new authenticated data structure for sequences, called SEQHASH, that makes it efficient for servers to construct summaries of computation histories in the presence of incremental re-computation. Experimental results with an implementation of VerSum show that VerSum can be used for a variety of computations, that it can support many clients, and that it can easily keep up with Bitcoin\xe2\x80\x99s rate of new blocks with transactions.': 14, "It's already there.": 2, 'Thanks!

Basically on a per-transaction basis I\'m creating hashed proofs that recursively depend on hashed proofs. That structure is a DAG for colored coins; the equivalent for Counterparty might be to have a "proof-chain" where each proof commits to the hash of the prior proofs - AKA the state of the previous block - along with details of everything that when into calculating the state transition, e.g. the hash of every Counterparty transaction, the hash of the operations called etc. While this falls short of actually getting a hash of the exact steps taken to calculate the new consensus state, at least this approach captures all the data used to do so.
