(Reversing any legitimate transaction is fraud and is illegal in both cases, of course.)\n\n0-conf transactions are identical to confirmed transactions data-wise, they just haven\'t been included by miners in a block yet. Unconfirmed transactions are broadcast around the network in the same way that blocks are. The seller (and every full node seeing the transaction) verifies it like any transaction: check that the outputs being spent are unspent, verify the scriptPubKey+scriptSig, etc. But because they\'re not in a block yet, they\'re fairly easy to reverse.\n\nBitcoin transactions are more expensive (when dealing with small amounts) and slower than credit card transactions because credit card companies just have to make a little change to their database to handle each transaction-- your Bitcoin transaction needs to be cryptographically verified by *every Bitcoin full node* and timestamped by the most powerful computing system in existence. In the future, small transactions will be handled by something built on top of Bitcoin that will allow near-free and near-instant transactions at the cost of reduced decentralization and/or reduced security (reduced *only* for for small, mostly-unimportant transactions like that).

If the new transaction gets confirmed, then the old transaction will be a double-spend and will surely never be confirmed in the same block chain.

There are thousands of memory pools, each of which is controlled exclusively by the node operator.\n\nBy default, the memory pool doesn\'t expire transactions.

There is only a fee, which a node will check by default before deciding whether to relay or not.\n\nIf a sufficiently high fee is lacking, and the coins aren\'t of high enough "priority", then the transaction is effectively censored.

You can think of a node as a program running on a computer, although there are more complex configurations.\n\nA node connects to somewhere between about 8 and 100 other nodes, which are called peers.\n\nNodes spread a transaction through the network through a process similar to the game "Telephone." You give your transaction to a single node. That node sends it to its peers, and so on. The process is called *propagation*.\n\nYour payment for coffee works the same way. You send the signed transaction to a node, who relays it to peers. Those peers relay it, and so on.\n\nThe store owner listens to a different node than yours. However, propagation ensures that this node will fairly quickly receive the transaction after you send it to your node.': 1, "I think their will be many chains.

When you generate a key pair it exists somewhere on this gigantic finite field. As long as people use the same algo their keys exist on the same field regardless of who they are in the entire universe. \n\nWhether you use a computer, paper and pencil, calculator, whatever, you are using the same mathematics. That's why it doesn't matter if you are online or not.\n\nContinuing, if you think of our field as a 3d graph and you stretched the graph out across the entire universe a single 'point' (private key) would be about 400 sq atoms. \n\nFurthermore, something called the Pareto Principle determines the current theory on the minimal amount of matter required to store 1 bit of information. Given that info it would take about 1.75 times the heat death of the universe to compute all possible private keys. Effectively, with current technology there is not enough matter/energy in the universe to store all possible keys.\n\nHowever, because there are a capped number of units (bitcoin) there can only be so many active addresses at one time. I.e. if every satoshi were controlled by a separate private key. Because of this, the odds of you ever generating a key pair that another person owns is basically not possible.\n\nThe reason why it has happened in the past is because of faulty/poisoned PRNG. \n\nNow, when you generate an address is a smaller number than your public key.

A user\xe2\x80\x99s conversion of Bitcoin into a real currency or another convertible virtual currency, therefore, does not in and of itself make the user a money transmitter."\n\n  Note also that there is a footnote on this paragraph that may or may not be important.

They\xe2\x80\x99re finding themselves entangled in a decadeslong debate about currency valuations that has bedeviled leading institutions such as the International Monetary Fund and the World Trade Organization. The complicated currency calculus is likely to persist well beyond any deal, stymieing attempts to rein in exchange-rate complaints through arbitration or diplomacy.\n\nSome U.S. lawmakers are channeling their constituents\xe2\x80\x99 long-held grievances by pressing to incorporate enforceable currency provisions into the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a proposed 12-nation free-trade deal tying together 40% of the global economy. Legislators from manufacturing-heavy states in particular\xe2\x80\x94such as Michigan, Ohio and New York\xe2\x80\x94worry that TPP members and potential future partners such as South Korea and China could offset any gains made through the pact by depreciating their currencies.\n\nYuan notes at a branch of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China in Shanghai. ENLARGE\nYuan notes at a branch of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China in Shanghai.

Some economists and companies, for example, say China\xe2\x80\x99s managed exchange-rate policy over the past decade cost the U.S. millions of jobs as Beijing subsidized its exporters by keeping the value of the yuan as much as 40% below the level market fundamentals would suggest.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCurrency manipulation is the mother of all trade barriers,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stephen Biegun, a vice president of international government affairs for Ford Motor Co. Ford, like other U.S. auto makers, is backing lawmaker proposals to punish countries that depreciate their currencies to gain a competitive advantage. The firm is particularly concerned about Japan, one of the largest car markets in the world and a TPP negotiating partner.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe can compete with any car manufacturer in the world, but we can\xe2\x80\x99t compete against the Bank of Japan,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Biegun said, referring to the central bank\xe2\x80\x99s role in driving down the value of Japan\xe2\x80\x99s currency under previous governments.\n\nEven if U.S. lawmakers\xe2\x80\x99 currency proposals are passed into law, determining the fair value of a currency is a major complication likely to frustrate their efforts to sanction trading partners.\n\nChristopher Padilla, a former Commerce Department undersecretary for international trade, said calculating a currency\xe2\x80\x99s appropriate value would be close to impossible, and create insurmountable operational challenges.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAsk ten different economists for the \xe2\x80\x98objective\xe2\x80\x99 market value of a foreign currency, and you will get ten different answers\xe2\x80\x94all well-argued and backed by econometric analysis, but all different,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Padilla, now a vice president of government and regulatory affairs for IBM, wrote recently.\n\nGOP lawmakers who support trade legislation have latched onto that argument to fend off congressional Democrats. \xe2\x80\x9cTo think that Congress can legislate what currency valuations are between countries is almost laughable,\xe2\x80\x9d House Speaker John Boehner (R., Ohio) said last week. He noted that lawmakers have been debating the issue for decades.\n\n\nThe IMF is designed to get around political debates, serving as the world\xe2\x80\x99s independent assessor of exchange-rate policies. Founded in the wake of World War II, the organization\xe2\x80\x99s goal was to prevent another global conflict in part by promoting stable currency regimes.\n\nIMF rules prohibit the fund\xe2\x80\x99s 188 member countries from manipulating their exchange rates to gain a competitive advantage. But the fund has never officially declared a country in violation of that prohibition. The fund\xe2\x80\x99s legal department said the prohibition \xe2\x80\x9cis a relatively complex provision and not all of its terms are easily understood, or easily applied.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe latest currency debate presents a circular problem: The leading proposals from U.S. lawmakers rely on the IMF\xe2\x80\x99s determinations. Legislation sponsored by Sen. Charles Schumer (D., N.Y.) would allow the U.S. to treat undervalued currencies as a subsidy, and subsequently apply duties on imports from that country in retaliation.\n\nIf trading partners challenged the U.S., as they likely would, the dispute would be arbitrated by the World Trade Organization. The WTO, in turn, looks to the IMF\xe2\x80\x99s expertise on exchange rates.\n\nThe IMF, however, is far from precise in those calculations.\n\nOver the past several years, it has been trying to develop new ways to measure currency values that member countries and economists could broadly agree indicate how much exchange rates were undervalued or overvalued. Their answer was to publish a range of possible valuations for major currencies based on several methodologies. The result: a wide range of valuations that, in some cases, contradict themselves.\n\nIn a report last year on major economies, for instance, the fund estimated the Japanese yen was between 15% overvalued and 15% undervalued in 2013. As U.S. auto companies and lawmakers seek to counter alleged damage from Japan\xe2\x80\x99s policies, the IMF\xe2\x80\x99s data showing overvaluation would give Tokyo a strong counterargument. It shows the IMF can be of two minds on the value of the yen, and other currencies.\n\nThe data also could raise questions about why U.S. car makers have struggled to compete with Toyota and other Japanese manufacturers, even after those companies have opened plants in the U.S. in part to nullify exchange-rate and trade-sanction issues.\n\nThe IMF\xe2\x80\x99s double-minded assessment of currency values goes beyond Japan.\n\nSouth Korea\xe2\x80\x99s won was between 5% and 20% undervalued, it estimated. The Hong Kong dollar was somewhere between 10% undervalued and 10% overvalued. The U.S. dollar was estimated to be 5% undervalued to 10% overvalued. The IMF\xe2\x80\x99s next report, due in coming weeks, will likely show significant changes in the 2014 data.\n\nThe IMF is also at odds with the U.S. on China\xe2\x80\x99s currency. While the fund says the yuan is approaching equilibrium after nearly a decade of appreciation, U.S. Treasury officials say it\xe2\x80\x99s still substantially undervalued.\n\nAnd last week IMF economists signaled again South Korea\xe2\x80\x99s won may be undervalued. But in the same breath, the IMF\xe2\x80\x99s executive board undercut the critique: \xe2\x80\x9cMethodological shortcomings amplify the uncertainty surrounding such an assessment.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nGary Hufbauer, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics and a former U.S. trade official, said passage of congressional currency provisions could set the stage for China and other countries to bring a case challenging the U.S. at the WTO. It\xe2\x80\x99s uncertain how the WTO would rule, and \xe2\x80\x9cChina could mount a strong case,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\nThe White House\xe2\x80\x94wanting the Pacific trading partners to sign a deal, but needing the votes of a pack of lawmakers pushing for currency legislation\xe2\x80\x94is backing a separate proposal by Sen. Michael Bennet (D., Colo.) that seeks to bolster U.S. oversight of trading-partner exchange rates.\n\nIt would apply far tamer sanctions. And in line with the long history of broad interpretations of currency levels, it would give the White House wide latitude to assess countries\xe2\x80\x99 exchange-rate policies and the appropriate punishments.': 15, "Stopped reading at 'calculus'.

Because if you have a polynomial of the form f(x)=(x-t)^2 g(x) and you take the derivative with respect to x, the x-t factor will show up in both terms of the product rule for derivatives. But if it's of the form f(x)=(x-t) g(x) and x-t is not a factor of g(x), then x-t will only be a factor of one of the terms of the product rule, so overall it won't be a factor of the derivative.\n\nNow, consider what happens if we really have 27b^2 =-4a^3. We can rewrite a=-3c^2 . Then b = 2c^3, so that the above equation reads 108c^6 =108c^6 . Then x^3 +ax+b becomes x^3 -3c^2 x +2c^3. And this factors as (x-c)^2 (x+2c). If you now graph the curve y=x^3 + ax+b = (x-c)^2 (x+2c) you see it will only cross the x-axis in two places (x=c and x=-2c) instead of the usual three places.

The derivative of the of the function x^3 +ax+b with respect to x is 3x^2 +a. In other words the slope of the graph of y=x^3 +ax+b at the point x=7 is 3(7)^2 +a.\n\nThe **resultant** of two polynomials (in x) is basically achieved by solving for x in one of the polynomials and plugging that value into the other.
