Yes, long forks are a problem, but only if we don\'t know why they are happening, or if they are happening due to a bug that was unforseen and must be fixed. Here, the fork is happening because some miners and services have slacked off and refused to upgrade. We all know that they are bad miners, and they are on a bad fork.

There are now pros and cons for the different types of currency here.\n\nLet's start with the cons and get them out the way\n\n* The learning curve is currently very steep, especially to the non technical world.\n\n* There is an exchange fee in doing this typically by the exchange you use and 2-3% seems a reasonable rate.\n\n* You have to look after your funds yourself, there is no undo button when using the protocol level.\n\n* It's headlines have historically appeared along side nefarious uses as many of those uses are screaming out for alternatives to the closed banking system.\n\n* It's still in development and things like scalability are still being worked on.\n\n* It's not widely accepted by retailers or people yet.  You generally have to exchange it back to your local currency to pay for goods.\n\n\n\nOk, now the pros.\n* The system is a push mechanism... i.e. you can give out your bitcoin address to anyone on the internet and your funds are still 100% secure.  Something bank details and credit cards simply can't do because it requires a full redesign of the banking system.\n\n* Payments at the protocol level are absolute, guaranteed.  No PayPal chargebacks ever!\n\n* Payments are instant from anyone to anyone anywhere in the world.\n\n* It's outside of the banking system, I.e. if Greece had known about it earlier there was no way a 'haircut' would be possible.\n\n* Transfer fees are a few cents for sending any sized transaction.\n\n* It enables new types of transactions like escrow or instantly paying multiple people at once.\n\n* It allows anyone and ANYTHING to own a balance.  I.e. computers can now have their own bank account that not even a human could access.  This enables an entirely new sector of computer science.\n\n* The system is very low level and can be built on.  In future it's unlikely people will be putting many transactions on the blockchain but instead it's a decentralised settlement device when trust is lacking (e.g. bank to bank transfers).\n\n* By remembering the pass phrase of words you can access and spend your bitcoin funds from anywhere in the world.\n\n* Meta data can be included in bitcoin to add to a provable ledger that can't be erased or have it's history modified.  This is incredibly useful for property assignment and proof of when something existed in time.\n\n* It wakes people up to why computer security is important.\n\n* It's the first finite global digital resource that can't be copied but can be owned hence derives a value in every country.\n\n* It's an open platform for anyone to write new financial software with in an area that was previously very closed to the private banks and payment providers.\n\n\n\nI was impressed when PayPal first appeared and knew they'd be huge but there was no way to be part of it, Bitcoin is vastly more exciting and it allows anyone to get involved.

I appreciate the concern of the OP and others on this thread, and I thought it might be helpful to provide some context.\n\nXapo has moved its corporate headquarters to Switzerland. The first step was mainly a legal process: Xapo Gmbh has been duly incorporated and our corporate restructuring is being completed.  The second step is operational: hiring staff and getting them trained and onboarded.  We have already hired key administrative personnel in Switzerland, including local company representatives accountants and attorneys, but the selection and staffing of excellent operational personnel will take longer.  \n\nOur goal over the coming months is making sure that quality service to our users is maintained and, ideally, enhanced.  We will take whatever steps are necessary to meet those goals, regardless of the time it takes to achieve them.\nThank you again for your concerns.\nTed': 8, 'Classical mailbox firm based in the paradise for these kind of companies: the Canton of Zug, Switzerland.

I disagree with you on that assertion, and so do our borrowers and lenders.\n\n> this $ never leaves the ecosystem and borrowers pay interest on this but you account for it in loan volume? You even have rep loans that don't get paid back but these are somehow perfectly valid? Aren't all loans technically reputation based? Im just very confused here please enlighten me.  \n\nI would be happy to enlighten you! :) :) \n\nWhen a lender parts with their money they always take the risk, regardless if it's a risk of default or opportunity risk. Frankly, there is risk of default here, it's just that there is no risk of actual loss. So the loan should properly compensate the risk and these loans do compensate for the low risk with a small interest fee. The lenders treat it as a loan and if the borrower does not repay it (for whatever reason), the lenders leave negative feedback. This is an obvious demonstration, to the lenders, that the borrower doesn't qualify for any loan whatsoever. The borrower only needs to run through this demonstration once, which is why we only allow one reputation type loan per borrower.\n\nThis is a similar concept to highly colateralized loans or secured credit cards.\n\n**TLDR: if the lender gives their money to somebody, and that person is expected to repay the money with interest (however low), then that's a valid loan, even if the risk of cash loss is almost 0.
