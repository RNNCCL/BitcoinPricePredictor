We cannot prevent all forms of malware attack, but one thing that we do is prevent any private keys from being saved on the device unencrypted.

But I trust them a hell of a lot more than any given pool operator.  Part of the problem is that bitcoin currently has no moat to centralization.  We saw that last year when one pool operator briefly had more than 50% hashing, and for most of the year 2 pool operators had over 50%.

The same way the NSA/China/Russia co-opts the first mining pool they can co-opt the second and the third and the fourth and the fifth.    The CIA has overthrown Latin American countries.  Co-opting half a dozen mining pools is so easy it's a joke.\n2.  They'd be spreading misinformation at the same time.  Average miners wouldn't know what's going on, who to trust, or which mining pool to join.\n": 1, "Your final post as of this writing in response to /u/Yorn2 suggests that an attacker could just keep messing with the main fork, which is a scenario where the attacker attacks multiple times. This doesn't work with a mining pool as you originally suggest here, because mining pools only get one shot. After that, everyone moves away from the pool and the operators are known to be untrustworthy.": 1, 'No collusion required and no contradiction.  Any one entity, the NSA, a rich Russian oligarch, a wealthy Chinese general etc could destroy bitcoin whenever they wanted.  All it would take is to coerce/bribe/hack a couple of the major mining pool operators and destroy faith in the system.  While messing with the blockchain you would simultaneously spread misinformation.  You\'d co-opt some respected leader in the bitcoin community (again through bribery or coercion) and you\'d easily create general confusion.  Miners would have no idea which pool should be joined, large numbers of blocks would have to be rolled back, and any integrity would be gone.\n\nAlso your claim which you\'ve repeated in your last paragraph twice now is simply wrong.  For most of 2014, the blockchain was controlled by just 2 mining pool operators who had the majority of hashing power.  Briefly it was controlled by just one.  That one guy could have issued as many bitcoins as he wanted or doublespent.  Of course other miners would then have fought back and there\'d have been a battle over rollbacks etc.  Of course other miners can always fork the blockchain etc.  But if your argument that someone doesn\'t possess the power to do something because others will stop them...why not apply that same logic to a government or to the Federal Reserve?  You could foolishly say, "The US government should not be feared because if they ever try to overstep their power others will quickly stop them."  Maybe, maybe not, but not instantly, and not before doing great damage.  Same with mining pool operators.\n\nAnd lastly, your second paragraph is very strange.  It seems like you\'re trying to argue that bitcoin is better, but actually doing the opposite.  "for over 100 years" <--- a long history lends credibility to USD much as it does to gold.  "a mathematical algorithm" <----an algorithm can\'t necessarily respond to changes in demand/supply intelligently, which is partly why gold failed so badly as a currency; but the opposite problem is also true; the bitcoin algorithm can be changed at any time at the whim of the people who control the hashing power.  I have less faith that they will change things in a positive way than I have faith that the Federal Reserve chairman will control the money supply in a positive way.  "not a single one of them ever possessing the power to confiscate the unit of record or change the rate of issuance"<---- as we established, this is simply false.  Bitcoin\'s hashing power was more than 50% controlled by a single pool operator briefly last year, and for a long time 40% controlled by a single pool.  Obviously 50% is not a magical line.  At 40%, you will eventually mine 8 blocks in a row, basically giving you control over the blockchain at least temporarily.\n\nSo let me answer your question:  Yes.  One issuing authority with a 100 year record of relative price stability and extreme political stability has shown it is more fit to issue a global reserve currency than an algorithm that can be easily abused by anyone with a couple billion dollars or anyone in power at the NSA or KGB.  That\'s why people want USD not gold.  That\'s why people want USD not bitcoin\n\nNow...I own bitcoin.  I like bitcoin.  The Federal Reserve recently printed an unprecedented amount of money that I think will lead to continued depreciation; and almost every other central bank worldwide is following their lead.  So I think bitcoin could potentially become a meaningful store of value, like a distant second to gold.  But let\'s not fool ourselves.': 1, 'You\'ve made a very strange argument that suggests you don\'t understand the concept of "risk."  You\'ve basically argued that because you\'ve gone skydiving 10 times and never died, then clearly the risk of dying while skydiving must be zero.  It\'s very silly.\n\nThe NSA or a rich Chinese or Russian oligarch could destroy bitcoin whenever they want.  They haven\'t chosen to do so yet.  They could choose to do so tomorrow.  The fact that they haven\'t chosen to do so yesterday tells us very little about the choices they will make tomorrow.  If bitcoin continues growing, the cost and difficulty to destroy it will continue growing.  In 2010 anyone with a few million to waste could probably have destroyed it.  Today that number might be in the low billions.  In 2018, I hope it will be $100 billion.\n\nAnd your argument about forking is flawed.  What prevents someone with a large amount of hashing power from simply repeating the attack on the new fork and then the newer fork, over and over again.  The point isn\'t that someone could destroy the bitcoin network computationally, but that they can destroy the integrity of the system.  If bitcoin users have to constantly worry about long strings of blocks being rolled back, it ceases to be a viable transaction method or store of value.': 1, ">I'm not concerned about theft or doublespends or anything like that with bitcoin.\n\n> Who would you prefer to entrust your life savings to\n\nYou are contradicting yourself. \n\n> the US/Russia/China could destroy the integrity whenever they want\n\nExplain how? It would require collusion between bitter enemies and public actors that could be identified and exposed quickly. Alternative pools have overtaken established pools time and time again. Miners gravitate to the best option out of their own volition and attempts to tamper with one pool will cause flight to a better one.\n\nAgain, is one issuing authority that works exclusively with one government for over 100 years better positioned to be a global reserve currency issuer over a mathematical algorithm that has had multiple issuers in the last five years with not a single one of them ever possessing the power to confiscate the unit of record or change the rate of issuance?": 1, 'Lol.

I\'ve heard various forms of "Bitcoin can be defeated" since at least 2011 when we were talking about this on the BitcoinTalk.org forums. There\'s countless threads where people said that Bitcoin didn\'t even have the hashing power to beat the world\'s biggest super computers. This was fixed as the hashrate continued to rise.\n\nThere were also [concerns about bandwidth to pools as the difficulty got higher](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=9137.0). Without GBT, Bitcoin would have never scaled in its original form and that was seen as "the death of Bitcoin". Even that got fixed over time.\n\nHell, you didn\'t even mention [the most notable example](https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/blog/2012/03/bitcoin-war-the-first-real-threat-to-bitcoin/) where we had a hostile actor who was mining empty blocks using (presumably) infected PCs. This meant tons of transactions were just being ignored. That too, was fixed by simply outgrowing the bad actor.\n\nIf it\'s so simple for someone to have bribed pools, miners, or respected members of the community, you shouldn\'t be talking about it as if it is something that will happen in the future, and instead consider that it has already happened, and work on proving that it has already happened.\n\nAnd then consider this, if it\'s already happened and the mining pools and code are still acting sufficiently fair, why is this even an issue? The second they stop being fair, miners will use another pool or continue to use Bitcoin core code they consider fair. The *right* fork will always win by being the most decentralized one, so the large actor mining his own pool with a majority or super-majority will always be at a disadvantage because rational people will fear that collusion.\n\nThere are some theoretical attacks that could work, sure, but they require convincing a majority of mining pools to hash on code that you\'ve convinced a developer to write, not just one or two. The amount of effort and bribery involved would be massive, because you cannot just convince the top two pools, you\'ve gotta convince enough pools such that if they were to leave there would still be an "appearance" of decentralization, so that most users also go. Otherwise the users will stay on the most decentralized fork.': 3, 'One issuing authority that works exclusively with one government for over 100 years is somehow better positioned to be a global reserve currency issuer better than a mathematical algorithm that has had multiple issuers in the last five years with not a single one of them ever possessing the power to confiscate the unit of record or change the rate of issuance?': 4, "A decentralized system is actually easier to attack.

I have run an association for over 30 years and the first thing you need to do is realise that you are in the association business, not the bitcoin business, so here are my recommendations...\n\n* ask your members what they want from the association and then listen to them because they will tell you exactly what to do. What you are already doing in consulting is a big step forward but the problem is that you will get so many suggestions that it will be difficult to see the wood for the trees. Identifying priorities is the mark of a good leader.\n\nFor example for a long time now the members have been asking for a closed bulletin board. There is no reason not to do this as the Bitcoin Foundation is a members-only association. You exclude non-members (from voting for example) so there is no contradiction in having a members' only section of your Web site. Doing this would be a quick and easy win.\n\n* in the medium-term you have to set up independent arrangements for development of the core so that it is at arms-length from the BF. Core funding has been affected by people's lack of willingness to donate to the BF. I think industry sentiment is that core development should be funded by a voluntary levy on the larger companies that benefit from it. They could do this by paying into a multi-sig escrow account where people could see the total balance governed by a Trust consisting of (say) the Chairman and Secretary of the BF and a number of laypersons (all elected).\n\nThe Foundation's role would be to oversee the arm's length agreement and issue accreditation to companies that donated as it does now to corporate members. Olivier Jannson has offered to underwrite two core developers' salaries for a year if necessary so you have some breathing space.\n\n* The direction of core development should be determined by a system of upvoting the issues which are most important to the users. The argument that the 'bright, shiny popular' changes would be made at the expense of the most important ones is a non-sequitur. The community must decide what is most important, for example I think incorporating privacy and anonymity in the core have been suppressed against community wishes (but I may be proved wrong!).\n\n* it may sound odd but the Principal Executive Committee is your enemy. The CEO/Executive Director does all the work. The PEC will turn up to meetings not having read the Agenda, not understanding the dynamics of the decisions that need to be made and bankrupt the association with claims for lost earnings, food, drink, world travel and accommodation like a load of superannuated cuckoos. Lots of people join associations for the kudos of meeting politicians and getting paid to travel. Everybody needs to pay a proportion of their expenses-this keeps out the freeloaders. PLUS recording the PEC meetings is a good idea. It keeps discussion considered and honest. It stops people making outrageous claims or colluding against the members during a meeting and it stops people lying about what they said afterwards (all very common). The recording is archived and only accessible to resolve disputes about the minutes. It is not in the public domain.\n\n* communication. You need to engage members. A monthly members-only newsletter is urgently required together with regular email-shots on important current affairs. You can start off by sacking your current PR team and getting proper internal and external PR. (see https://bitcoinfoundation.org/forum/index.php?/topic/732-this-site-should-host-a-media-releases-page/)\n\n* structure. It is becoming clear that bitcoin is going to be regulated locally, so our response must be local. This means we need to have a system of local 'chapters' supported by and within a confederation. There are many models for this so I will not elaborate apart from saying that this is more in keeping with the communities wish for decentralisation than a single overarching BF trying to do everything. Meetings should be held via Skype or similar. Asking members to make suggestions to the association's rules by submitting a pull request in GitHub is off the nerdy spectrum.\n\nThere's enough to keep you going for five years so I'll stop.

There will then be one market for BTC v3/USD and another market for BTC v4/USD.    The primary losers in the end will be those who have coins in custodial accounts who will then be unable to withdraw full value as the service provider will likely only honor withdrawal of one coin (e.g., v3) or the other (e.g., v4).  Other losers will include those who lent coins prior to the fork where the borrower could take the opportunity to repay with coins that are not from the side of the fork that the lender would prefer the repayment to occur from.\n\nSo tl:dr; a hard-fork to support larger blocks is planned and most likely will occur.

You endlessly promote people like Erik Vorhees who uses Bitcoin to promote and agenda that has no hope of ever being accepted by most Bitcoin users.   The theory is that once people start using Bitcoin that people then automatically agree with the whole agenda.  That is delusional.  Just because someone completes a Bitcoin tx does not mean they are going walk around with Ayn Rand books under their arm.  If someone wants to use Bitcoin to promote an agenda that is find but that is not what Bitcoin is and it is not what the Foundation should be promoting.  Many users want nothing to do with people who around talking about how Bitcoin will end wars, replace the US Dollar, and collapse governments.  This type of agenda does not stand on its own merit which is why many use (distort) Bitcoin to try to gain publicity for their cause.  \n\nSomeone from the Foundation\'s education committee tried to claim that because they would accept input from anyone that the education committee was "decentralized."  I found it shocking that someone on the education committee doesn\'t even understand decentralization and that the blog post was posted at the Foundation\'s web site without anyone saying anything.
