I don't understand what you're getting at.

I\'m curious as to what you believe it to be. Here\'s my idea: I\'m not sure that Satoshi\'s said enough about politics for us to label him a full-blown anarchist, but from Satoshi\'s writings, I think we can conclude at least two things about his vision: \n\n1) He is not a fan of central banking and trusting financial institutions. (Genesis block message, hard cap, and the blockchain in general)\n\n2) He saw bitcoin as a tool for privacy. (Non-reuse of addresses built into client, his postings about possible use cases)\n\n>But in my opinion we are seeing more and more of the exact opposite of Satoshi. Users whose sole metric is the exchange rate and black friday sales numbers. Users whose only focus is "mainstream" adoption and how quickly PayPal will be selling bitcoin.\n\nIn order to ever challenge central banks and financial institutions (point #1),  bitcoin will require orders of magnitude more liquidity. You simply can\'t challenge the existing financial system with a 5 billion dollar market cap. So where will that liquidity come from? Crypto-anarchists? No. Bitcoin must go mainstream and gain massive liquidity to ever do what we think Satoshi wanted it to do (challenge, or at least be an alternative to the existing financial system). Part of that liquidity will come from e-commerce and integration with big business. \n\n>I understand that most of these things can happen at the same time. People can spend bitcoins online and in stores and they can still be what Satoshi invented. But I fear if we wander too far from his view it will be bad for bitcoin.\n\nI think having some people who are solely focused on promoting mainstream bitcoin use is very good for bitcoin. Even if they are self-interested and don\'t give a hoot about Satoshi\'s vision, they are still helping to grow the system. \n\n>There are very few people in the world as altruistic as Satoshi appears to be, right now.\n\nI think that one of the strengths of bitcoin is that it doesn\'t require altruism to succeed. Greedy, self-interested people and attackers alike will grow and harden bitcoin. \n\n>A truly divided user base, especially one as small as bitcoin could set us back years.\n\nI\'m not sure bitcoin\'s userbase was ever really united. The speculators and daytraders will continue to provide liquidity for the rest of us who need to buy and sell at any time of day. The VC guys will keep investing in big companies with mainstream appeal. The big bitcoin companies will make it usable for the mainstream. And the crypto-anarchists will continue to build tools that allow bitcoin users to have privacy and bypass laws (e.g. Coinjoin/Dark Wallet).': 8, 'I do absolutely feel your point here... then again... how else could such a new and genuine tool gain acceptance in a world based on pure capitalism?\n\nI think btc will still live up to its potential when (if!) it gains global mainstream acceptance.

Bitcoin, the idea of a neutral currency, won't die as long as there are those who believe in it.  If the current implementation of bitcoin veers to far from that ideal, then some people will fork.  I don't think it will come to that though. Bitcoin's neutrality is its whole value proposition, greed will motivate all bitcoin holders to ensure that value is not destroyed.\n\nNot everyone realizes yet that neutrality is bitcoin's value proposition.

There are TONS of misconceptions that have been eliminated in the last few years, I'm actually very impressed with how fast things have progressed.": 1, 'You have to start somewere...': 2, "I think that Satoshi knew people wouldn't adopt Bitcoin for altruistic reasons, which is why he designed it with such drastic block reward decreases and with such a large percentage of the coins being minted relatively early in the mining lifetime.

He may have preferred that it didn't, but recognised that it had to to gain critical mass.\n\nDoes anyone know if he ever spoke about his design choices in this regard?

"Devs should never deploy" just disregards a huge movement towards producing high quality software.\n\nI think a better expression should be that "low quality untested software should never get deployed to production".\n\nTrends that solve these kinds of issues\n\n* Test-driven development\n* Continuous integration\n* Deployment pipeline and server provisioning\n* Continuous deployment\n* Smoke/sanity tests\n* Feature flagging - switching features on/off for specific users/subsets\n* Failover endurance testing with things like Netflix\'s chaos monkey.\n\nDetails\n\n* TDD - developers write tests before writing code. An automated test suite can be run at any point in time and guarantee that any changes have not broken the product. This provides more confidence in the correctness of the codebase and catches design flaws and most simple bugs early. Testing can include \n  * acceptance testing\n  * system testing\n  * integration testing\n  * functional testing\n  * unit testing\n* Continuous integration - a separate server that runs all the tests each time changes are made and alerts to failures\n* Deployment pipeline etc. You can use tools like chef and/or puppet to provision servers in a repeatable reliable way. The deploy process can use tools like this to guarantee the setup of a machine. Developers can work with vagrant virtual machines to have a machine that is exactly the same as production\n* Continuous deployment - changes that pass all tests are rolled out to a staging environment automatically. No chance to forget a step of the deploy process\n* Smoke/sanity tests. You can run full tests against production and/or production identical environments after code is deployed\n* Failover endurance testing. By actively trying to attack your own production environment you can be assured of it\'s robustness.\n\nAnyway, all of these tools lead towards one thing. Developers - i.e. the ones with the most knowledge and skill and ability to fix production failures have the most tools at their disposal and ability to fix problems as quickly as possible.\nNo amount of manual QA can detect all possible failure cases so the best thing is to keep the skilled people as close to the frontline as possible.\n\nSo **developers should deploy to production**. And as often as possible to prevent unexpected changes due to huge backlogs of features all hitting production at once.\nBut if you have a shitty system that has none of these automated processes and tools in place then you\'re right: No developer should deploy to production.': 5, 'We at Yacuna also have a testnet faucet and fully functional sandbox for Bitcoin, Dogecoin and Litecoin.\n\nhttps://yacuna.com/blog/press/yacuna-releases-bitcoin-api/': 2, 'When he says build they mean build their bank accounts.

You said "There is zero chance a seller of legal items would [want to use OB]" and I pointed out that that is obviously factually wrong.

So that\'s a lie. At the very best, it\'s your misguided opinion, but it definitely is not a "fact".\n\nAnd I don\'t think I have to explain why anonymity and decentralisation matter.

Bitcoin is disruptive and there are many who will not want it to succeed.
