This poses a major problem during deployment: if full node adoption lags miner adoption, the segwit-supporting P2P network can partition and lose consensus.\n\n>**While Pieter Wuille's segwit branch(1) doesn't yet implement a fix for the above problem, the obvious thing to do is to add a new service bit such as NODE_SEGWIT, and/or bump the protocol version**, and for outgoing peers only connect to peers with segwit support. Interestingly, a closely related problem already exists in Bitcoin Core: neither addrman nor the outgoing connection thread takes what service bits a peer advertises into account. So if a large number of non-block-relaying nodes joined the network and advertised their addresses the network could, in theory, partition even without an explicit attack. (My own full-RBF fork of Bitcoin Core does fix(2) this issue, though by accident!)\n\n>Note how because of this the segwit soft-fork has properties not unlike hard-forks in terms of the need for nodes to upgrade with regard to the P2P layer. Even with the above fix, the worst case would be for segwit to not be adopted widely by full node operators, resulting in a network much more vulnerable to attacks such as DoSing nodes.

Sure, a few people could fork the Core repo and take it over. But I highly doubt after an event such as a Classic hard fork very many people will be interested in continuing to develop Core. That or some of them will be continuing on what they view as the better chain, the non-Classic one(probably with a different PoW for security reasons). Hard forking to Classic is a full commitment to Toomim taking over the lead maintainer role of the whole Bitcoin project. Simply switching back to Core if people don\'t like what they bought into just won\'t be an option.\n\nI just fundamentally disagree with you perception of people involved with Core and what their intentions are and whether or not they intentionally mislead people. The community can complain and demand as much as they want, but there\'s real constraints and real trade offs that need to be considered. \n\nTheymos censoring his own sub and message board has absolutely nothing to do with Core. Personally I don\'t agree with it, and I see that his actions have resulted in many people supporting something like Classic as some sort of misguided protest against it. The only thing people can really say is that Core didn\'t condemn the censorship, but as gmaxwell pointed out in another thread Core isn\'t some single entity that can just voice an opinion like that.\n\nI saw that random person post the out of context chat snippet too and thought it was a bad post with bad intentions. But even so, the whole idea of democratic governance in Bitcoin(especially done through something like consider.it) isn\'t a very good idea for a highly technical project like Bitcoin.\n\nOn hard forks vs soft forks, I don\'t really know. Maybe the dangers are overblown a bit, maybe not. We\'ve had multiple soft forks, and the most recent one resulted in some miners losing a block or two due to a big Chinese miner SPV mining. I don\'t remember the exact circumstances, but I remember some people lost some money by being on the wrong side of a fork, and Gavin personally refunded them their lost money out of his own pocket. Whether or not everyone would execute a hard fork properly in this day and age, I don\'t know, but it\'s certainly not impossible that there is a danger of people losing money from being on the wrong side. I don\'t have a strong opinion on this subject either way.\n\nI don\'t buy in to any of the Blockstream conspiracy theories at all. They donated money to an open source software project, not some private solution for scaling.\n\nA hard fork to Classic would alienate(or drive away) a world class dev team with multiple PhDs and professionals with lots of experience. They\'ve already proven their ability and produced some impressive improvements. From what I can tell people support Classic based on a fundamental mistrust of Core. I trust Core and I think their plan to scale Bitcoin is far superior to handing over the project and the faith of it\'s current 6 billion dollar market cap to something Gavin literally called "a startup" to me today.': 12, 'Miners gonna mine anything minable.': 1, '> somehow when he calls a hardfork an altcoin no one complains\n\nMaybe it has something to do with not using it as a justification to censor the discussion?': 1, 'Why not double BIP101?

They\'re talented guys, surely they could learn from their mistakes regarding the community and take a more communal approach going forward. Making proposals that\'d find their way into Classic, seeing as those guys seem a lot more willing to accept when ideas from people I view as being on the same team; Seen from their willingness to incorporate SegWit alongside their promise to increase block size.\n\nBitcoin is fundamentally democratic though, and it\'s Core\'s inability to engage with the public in a reasonable compromise, something the miners over in China agreed with, is reprehensible in my opinion. They can\'t just say "tough" and stick to their roadmap when the community, made up of node runners and miners who secure the network, disagree.\n\nusing the term conspiracy with regards to Blockstream is damaging to the simple concept of a vested interest. Sure, it might not be an agreement in writing, but when a company who hands you over that sum of money, you\'re likely to want to push things like SegWit a little harder than just upping the block size.\n\nIf Core upped to 2MB I\'d be a little less discouraged by their actions, but I think we need to new blood. Saying Classic is a start up is fact though. Any negative connotation that goes along with that is due to misconception of what a start up has become today. I trust both groups to do the right thing, they both have a lot of talent amongst them, and at this point, I prefer the sound of a Classic due to what I believe is a slight leaning from Core toward keeping block sizes small on the basis that it would benefit their business partner who helped keep the lights on. That\'s not a stretch and certainly not conspiratory.\n\nAlso, the latest debacle of removing Mike Hearn\'s code for the thinning of blocks makes Core look like straight up saboteurs. I\'m interested to see how that one pans out.\n\nEdit; And here we can see how the block thinning removal is panning out, with some detective work and sources provided. https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/43jzdj/smoking_gun_did_gregory_maxwell_unullc_quietly/': 1, 'I don\'t deny that they\'re not always full, but at peak usage they have been. Bitcoin\'s transaction capacity should be well above what it can reach at peak time.\n\nI\'m concerned that with blocks being full, as they have been in the past, transactions take longer to clear as they\'re pushed back, requiring larger fees to be included in blocks sooner. I would prefer the fee market to be as low as possible, if only to allow Bitcoin to stimulate growth around the world, circumventing the articificial "high risk" zones set by banks, resulting in millions of unbanked people\'s in African nations, parts of South America, and across Asia. And in removing the unnecessarily high fees set by banks to transfer money overseas we might see a renaissance in trade, being able to connect with merchants the world over with needless hurdles, much like how we all communicate over the Internet. Admittedly there\'s someone doing that job and you\'re paying they\'re wages but it\'s extortionate paying around \xc2\xa320 to send say, \xc2\xa350 to Spain, which I\'ve tried to do in the past.\n\nWhen people realise to how revolutionary crypto currencies are, and with Bitcoin being the most well known and popular, would you rather we be hamstrung?

You\'re unfairly attributing some sort of divine power to the Core developers by virtue of being the ones "at the reins". Nobody should be "at the reins" - Every step on Bitcoin\'s roadmap should be part of a consensus, with everyone having their opinion heard, and a majority should be able to implement their decision. Not a dictatorship where the wills of the community aren\'t considered part of their vision. That\'s plain wrong.

Misleading people to believe hard forks are any more dangerous, relying solely on a hard fork seeming more difficult than a soft fork due to the terminology. And their incredibly skewed position in raising the transaction volume allowed on the block chain due to corporate interest in off chain private solutions thanks to the huge monetary donation from Blockstream.

What problems users have had with non-full nodes have mostly been to mistakes and not malice (the "SPV mining" of July 2015; unverified signatures accepted on blockchain dot info).  I\'m not aware of any attacks involving segmenting off an SPV user and sending them blocks with valid PoW but invalid transactions.\n\nSo it makes sense that a full node might seem like security overkill to many people -- why go to all this trouble to prevent attacks, when nobody is going to try to rip me off?  In some cases that may be an acceptable trade-off, just as some people don\'t bother locking their front door, while others install expensive security systems.

If you outsource the transactions which sweep the revoked past states, that does require a decent amount of storage (maybe 100 bytes per state, though I supposed you could send the monitoring node the elkrem receiver and get it down to ~75? about the size of a sig). \n\nSo nodes that monitor the outsourced revocation / sweep transactions have an incentive to be full nodes (they kindof have to; in SPV it\'s easy to just not tell someone about a tx, and the whole point of the monitoring node is that it monitors everything).

If it's similar to existing P2P networks, they are centralized 'lists' that are queried to determine where the current peers are.

Sure, you can configure a node, and if you were a payment processor, it's going to provide you more certainty having a node to directly query for your transactions, but it turns out a lot of processors have decided that it's an overhead they can do without.  By having the nodes incentivized, in that they can 'earn' bitcoin on transactions, more people would choose them for purely selfish reasons.

But if the plans for the lightning network were to be believed, and I can't see why they shouldn't, it will be able to facilitate several orders of magnitude more transactions.

A P2P connection (what the LN is?) still requires some handshaking, in order to connect peers.  Those transactions are still going to need to be 'bundled up' and the ultimate settlement is still on the block-chain.  My understanding is that it will be bundled as one single transaction, or some smaller number of transactions, than the total that has been accrued on the lightning network.

You could have LN nodes, or traditional nodes, except the LN nodes have an incentive for running them.  I think you'd find one side taking over after short period of time, but that's up to the node owner.

It's been about 3 years since I left my job in finance and pretty much not a day goes by where I don't miss it. However my other passion is in bitcoin and so creating something like a bitcoin investment fund would be a perfect alignment of my passions. \n\nFast forward to the idea - I'm just trying to start what would probably be best described as a small hedge fund. I don't really feel as though there is a need to create some prototype proof of concept. My proof of concept is that I've been talking to people about bitcoin since 2012, help dozen of people invest in bitcoin and continue to be a source of information for people who want information about bitcoin within my community. I know there is an interest in the market. I've been living it for 4 years. \n\nWhat I was trying to get an answer to (which I think I've found) is whether or not I could create this type of business w/o having to register as an investment company.

However once I surpass 15 clients I myself would need to be a registered investment advisor - which is easy to do. \n\nSo if I can get this up and running there really won't be a need for any website/software/program - it would just be simple trading being done by myself. I'm pretty sure based on the minimal amount of client's I'd be looking to engage and a minimum amount of capital - I'd probably fly under the radar anyway.

And so on. Bitcoin is what people use bitcoin for. \n\nWhat I meant: Maybe we get that scalability-shit together, be it with the blocksize, be it with lightning. That would be the best, than bitcoin could CONTINUE to be p2p cash. But if we don\'t get it, Bitcoin will not be doomed, but just stop being p2p cash and become digital gold or a settlement network.

Here they are (edited for context):\n\nThere are numerous, very serious flaws both in the paper itself and the idea, as far as I can tell (without yet having read it all).\n\n1. I fail to see the point of using a QR code as a message format within an image - the image already must be transmitted digitally, so why wouldn\'t the plaintext payload just be directly hidden in the steg\'d image data? This idea completely bypasses the entire point of QR codes, which is to be machine-readable from analog media. The transmission must already be digital (and of significant resources, if you\'re serious about recommending .bmp as the container format), so I fail to see literally any point whatsoever in bringing QR Codes into the mix. Not to mention that the QR Code format is proprietary...\n\n2. Why are you using such weird ciphering schemes? And why are you rolling your own crypto at all? Symmetric crypto is quite mature - why not just use an already well-reviewed and highly secure library for a well-reviewed system, like AES, Salsa20, TwoFish, etc.? The very first and most important rule of coding crypto is DON\'T ROLL YOUR OWN CRYPTO, and that\'s for very good reason.\n\n3. A vernam cipher? Seriously? Have we learned nothing from the RC4 break? Where is the keystream coming from? Can you trust CSPRNG? Does the system even make use of one?\n\n4. Cryptanalysis is hardly worthy of the name, and is not a reflection of your actual threat model. If the authors are not a cryptographer or cryptologist, I wouldn\'t bother trying to do your own cryptanalysis - although if you were using an actually secure cryptosystem like those named above, you wouldn\'t need to, anyway. The cipher choice and demonstrated attacks appear to be literally decades out of date.\n\n5. The "password" functionality seems to be completely pointless - all it does is allow the software to... parse the LSBs from the image. And it\'s not even stored in the image with a KDF or anything, not that it would matter... What is the intended purpose of this "steganography password?" Note that attackers will simply modify your code or write their own to ignore this "password" functionality - and it will not be difficult to do, even for an extremely novice programmer.\n\n6. I see no mention of Message Authentication Codes anywhere in the system. This is a mistake. Also, be sure to use Encrypt-Then-MAC ("ETM") as other schemes have demonstrated weaknesses in recent years.\n\n7. There are numerous, glaring spelling, tense and grammatical mistakes throughout the paper, which are forgivable to an extent, but are definitely not helping the authors, here.\n\n8. The paper offers no comparisons to existing image steg systems, like OutGuess, StegHide, whatever that new one that Bram Cohen is working on is, etc. Why not? I would say that such comparisons would be an essential part of a paper like this.\n\n9. A system reliant on BMP images in 2016 completely defeats the purpose of steganography, as such images stand out like a sore thumb (and are difficult to transport, besides) in the age of GIF, JPEG and PNG.\n\nThe intensions of this paper and efforts are exceptional, and I\'m very glad that work is done in the field.
