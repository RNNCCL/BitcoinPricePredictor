I\'ve worked in IT for decades ... there are a fuckton of process, governance, and technical controls that can (and are) applied to financial systems on a daily basis to prevent insider threats.  And they work.\n\nSeriously, where do you think concepts like multisig came from?  In IT we call that quorum-based authorization (i.e.: the twin "nuclear launch keys" in a submarine that are more than an arm\'s length apart from each other).\n\n> Sony sure as shit wasn\'t in control... and it\'s Sony!\n\nNow who is mixing topics?

I\'m not going to *fork* the current blockchain ... I\'m going to use Satoshi\'s code to create a brand new blockchain (i.e.: an altcoin), with a new genesis block of my own ... and call it RINOcoin.  On day #1 there will be 1 miner - my laptop.  On day #2 there will be 13 miners - a dozen AWS servers all around the world, and my laptop.\n\nIs that "more secure" or "less secure" than Bitcoin?  Cryptographically, I don\'t see how there\'s a variance - since it\'s the same code.  So that brings us back to the "*MOAR nodes is better!*" argument.\n\n> As I said, there are by now dozens of examples of failed alt-coins (you can create one yourself in about 35 seconds, btw, knock yourself out).\n\nRight.  That\'s what RINOCoin would be.  \n\n>They failed because either a) no one cared about them or, b) enough people cared about them to give them value and, as a consequence of that, make them appealing to those who would want to hack them and profit.\n\nOk, now instead of RINOcoin ... let\'s get back to where this all started and suppose Western Union decides they like blockchains, but hate Bitcoin ... so they decide to create WUCoin, on a new blockchain with its own genesis block.  Unlike points A) and B) you note above, they *will* care about it.  And let\'s say that they update the software that is already deployed to [100,000 ATMs worldwide](http://corporate.westernunion.com/Corporate_Fact_Sheet.html) to crunch away on WUcoin transactions during spare cycles when the machines aren\'t doing anything else (i.e.: helping a customer that is physically present in front of it).  Now the WUCoin network would have a cryptocurrency of their own, on trusted hardware and communication links (because Western Union has already sunk the costs to put the hardware and communication infrastructure in place to run those ATMs) with 100,000 processing nodes - 16x greater than Bitcoin.\n\nSo tell me again why WU starting their own blockchain would be doomed to failure?\n\n\n': 1, '> Because the blockchain is secure.\n\nIf I download [Bitcoin 0.9.3](https://bitcoin.org/en/download) and start running it on a dozen Amazon Web Services servers around the globe, and call it RINOCoin ... how is that *less* secure than Bitcoin?\n\nIs it cryptographically less secure?  I tend to doubt that, as it\'s the same code - but if there is a cryptographic weakness when fewer nodes are running, that would be interesting (I\'ve not heard that before).\n\nIs it less secure, because I am 1 person with only a few dozen servers around the globe?  Sure ... ok.  But, *less secure against what*?  I\'m not going to fork my blockchain ... because I\'m in control.  And I trust all the physical nodes and their locations because they are under my control.\n\nIf I\'m a Western Union, I can probably afford to throw several hundred servers at it.  Heck, a decent sized Amazon Web Server instance is about $50 per month.  So I can stand up 100 of them in each region (I think they have 9 regions) and have a 900-node RINOCoin network, and it\'ll cost me less than $50k per month.  Is it "secure" at that point, when I have 900 distributed nodes?\n\nThis is why "*it\'s more secure!*" is a vapid argument (IMO) because it\'s simply a dick-measuring contest.  Yeah, so Bitcoin has 6,000+ nodes.  Do you think it needs 6,000 to be secure?  Could it be just as secure with 600?  \n\n6,000 anonymous nodes when you\'re trying to torrent a file = very appealing\n\n6,000 anonymous nodes, when you\'re trying to figure out where to put your financial data = not very appealing\n': 1, 'Not when all of the mining nodes are privately controlled - as I\'d mentioned above "*They could just stand up a few hundred servers at 3rd party colo facilities around the globe*".

That\'s about as helpful as the answers to real problems like blocksizes not scaling being answered with "*there\'s a fix in the wiki!*".\n\nSo, in other words - not an answer.\n\nOk.  So, the *difficulty level* adjusts -- simply to make earning rewards harder (as Moore\'s Law marches ever forward).  "Making earning rewards harder" is not the same as "making it more secure", especially when you consider the scenario of if a "central bank" wanted to use a cryptocurrency.  They would deploy all of their own compute nodes, in their own facilities, to do so (not that I think any would even entertain such a ridiculous idea).  A blockchain can be just as "secure" with a couple hundred controlled nodes maintaining the chain in controlled facilities ... and that\'s exactly how a central bank or [SWIFT](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society_for_Worldwide_Interbank_Financial_Telecommunication) (who handle 173 financial transactions per second) would go about it.\n\nIt\'s clear you really don\'t have any clue what you\'re talking about - especially with comments like:\n\n> security, ease of use, speed and **cost efficiency** of the blockchain\n\nThe the blockchain is *anything* but cost-efficient.  In fact, it\'s probably the most cost-inefficient transactional ledger on the planet.  3 transactions per second, real-world tops?  Visa and WU have that beat hundreds of times over.  And it costs $300m a year for that network (~$225/BTC * 3,600 coins per day * 365 days per year)?': 1, '**Exactly**.\n\nAnd that\'s the exact answer to the question above "nothing is stopping them [Visa,MC,Amex] from piggybacking [their system] onto the blockchain" - they would never do it, because they have much more efficient systems.  But, if for some reason they decided they did want to ... they\'d roll out their own private blockchain on trusted nodes.  They\'d never use the existing network.\n\nTranslation - Bitcoiners who think that everything that ever possibly wants to use a blockchain (and therefore their coins will be heading to the moon *any day now*) are seriously deluded.': 1, "And this is exactly what the central banks are trying to do! They want all the security, ease of use, speed and cost efficiency of the blockchain but basically don't want to use the tokens, hence why they will ultimately fail in creating there own alt coin.

It isn't about the distribution of the nodes, it's about the hashpower securing the network. \n\nAll the nodes provide is consensus to ensure everyone is on the same page.\n\nThe hashpower is what stands between the blockchain and an attacker who wants to alter the distributed ledger after the fact.\n\nAs I said, there are by now dozens of examples of failed alt-coins (you can create one yourself in about 35 seconds, btw, knock yourself out).

That scenario works well for TOR and pirating movies ... but *businesses* generally want to control the systems that they depend on.  So, were Visa/MC/WU ever to adopt a blockchain as a distributed ledger (for some reason I can\'t possibly fathom) I find it highly doubtful they would use the current Bitcoin blockchain.

There are benefits and risks to using a fixed exchange rate. A fixed exchange rate is usually used in order to stabilize the value of a currency by directly fixing its value in a predetermined ratio to a different, more stable or more internationally prevalent currency (or currencies), to which the value is pegged. In doing so, the exchange rate between the currency and its peg does not change based on market conditions, the way floating currencies will do. This makes trade and investments between the two currency areas easier and more predictable, and is especially useful for small economies in which external trade forms a large part of their GDP."\n': 1, 'HKD has been fixed to USD since the 80s.

The main problem is that information is not uniformly distributed but highly concentrated, and this is particularly true with leaks. This limits the merits of the provably random chunk selection. In particular I see that:\n\n- A dishonest player could craft a false leak from legitimate-looking chunks. She could even make multiple Sybil-style commitments (encrypted differently) of the same file, and then when the block-height is known only claim ownership of the less revealing one, so that the fake comes evident only after the full decryption.\n\n- An owner of trade secrets could try to fish on their spying competitors. She could actually leak her own trade secrets, force competitors to burn bitcoins for these, then never reveal the secret.\n\n- A potential leaker that is not interested in leaking but is quite certain that the information will eventually become public could harvest some free money by not spending the bitcoins until the information is leaked through other channels.': 4, '> it would take an infeasible amount of encryptions to get into this state\n\nI do not think so. I admit that I have not done the precise math, but intuitively:\n\nLet us say for simplicity that the fake is a redacted document and that the dishonest leaker wants to hide the fact that it is actually redacted. The spatial distribution of information is a power law (of exponent between 1 and 2 -- my guess) implying that, roughly, the most informative 5% of the document has 50% of the information. Furthermore, this 5% is *clustered* in space. Let us assume that consequently a 5% is redacted.\n\nWe now need to take into account the discretization due to the division in chunks. Let us assume 100 chunks. Redacted parts are more granular and closer to the continuous limit, but clustered, therefore there will be typically not more than 10 chunks containing redacted parts (the attacker could also play with document margins and redacted-block boundaries to further "optimize" this).\n\nNow, if 25 chunks are uniformly random selected, there is ~5% probability of not hitting a fake one. This means that 20 parallel encryptions will suffice half of the time, or 100 parallel encryptions for a ~90% attack success rate.

On top of that, a 2^nd, time locked transaction can be generated that sends the funds to the merchant. \n\nSo now you have the following functionality:\n\nIf the customer files a dispute (with proof) with the arbitrator, and he agrees with the customer, they can construct a transaction that will send the funds back to the customer (possibly with a small fee for the arbitrator).\n\nIf the merchant provides proof to the arbitrator that goods were delivered, the arbitrator and the merchant can construct a transaction (again, with a small fee for the arbitrator) that sends the funds to the merchant.\n\nMerchant and customer can also choose to construct a transaction together, should the arbitrator disappear (or demands a higher fee, etc).\n\nShould any two parties no longer be able to sign, the funds will automatically go to the merchant (time locked transaction). \n\nI haven't seen any developments in this area yet, but I'm sure people are working on this. I really hope that whoever is working on this will write up BIP's, so we end up with a standard way of implementing this. \n\nAlso, when we do, I hope we end up with a free market for transaction arbitration, where the only two metrics we have to care about is trustworthiness of the arbitrator and fees. \n\n": 2, 'Sending money to the wrong place doesn\'t have to be that technical. "Request payment" buttons should replace wallet addresses I.e if I want to fund my localbitcoin acct i should have a button that sends an invoice to my wallet for payment. This would save copy and paste mistakes and creates that extra step of confirming that you entered YOUR wallet address to request payment rather than sending money to a random address. \n\nSo far as refunds go I can\'t think past escrow services sitting between merchants and consumers as being the solution. In the real world Amazon as a merchant can be trusted, especially with a public ledger of proof in the blockchain. But private deals will require a trusted escrow option. \n\nSomeone like bitpay need to provide an escrow service with paypal style arbitration in disputes. I know, I heard it, it\'s wrong, wrong wrong... But in reality if you want mass adoption it\'s going to need safeguards provided by trusted sources so that when things go wrong they can be fixed. \n\nOverall wallet addresses probably need to be claimed and given ownership titles that are made public for those that need to.

Right now people (mostly) copy/paste addresses or use QR codes, so there is little chance of mistake there. Bitcoin addresses include a checksum which allows (well built) software to confirm an address is valid before funds are sent, so leaving off a character or mistyping one would result in an invalid address. Accidentally typing a different address which still has a valid checksum is highly unlikely. \n\nNow if some other valid address ends up being the one copied and pasted or scanned that's another story. The fate of those funds is solely determined by the holder of the matching private key.": 2, "The quick cop-out answer which incidentally has a lot of value is 'there is none, and that's a feature'.\n\nI know it sucks but it's hard to have your cake and eat it too. At the fundamental level there needs to be a way to receive money, and for that money to be yours, unequivocally, without recourse. If that isn't the case, then you never have full autonomy, it's never your money, it's merely money in your account that can be taken away by a second party, so you're again at the mercy of others in your autonomy and ownership.\n\nBitcoin was the system to solve that.\n\nDoes that work well in a consumer-facing setting? I'm not sure, probably not. Bitcoin is just a protocol, there's no particular reason why humans have to use it. The majority of humans may come to prefer a reversible system built on top of bitcoin where bitcoin is just the protocol to unite many different payment systems and gateways and act as a network for businesses and services build on top of it which have a dispute system for edge cases.\n\nThat having been said, there are various things that prevent mistaken funds making it very unlikely to happen (I've never in my life made such a mistake with my banking for example). Like BIP 70 that works with confirmations, the checksums that are part of the protocol (typo being a valid address is extremely rare), and over time we'll likely abstract out public keys (you'll have one linked to say your Facebook, and so you'll just click a friend's face to send him money rather than type in a long address). And lastly culture, too. When you send money to the wrong address it's 99.999999% of the time a mis-chosen address, as opposed to a typo ending up with a valid random address. So you'll just have to contact that party and explain, and you'll be able to sign the now-spent output to prove you owned it and just request for mis-sent funds to be sent back to you. Which means each individual has to keep a record of what addresses they send money to and who the owner is of the address which is naturally obviously known (you don't send random people money) and thus there is recourse there, you simply contact them and if not go to the authorities and show blockchain proof. (yes, if bitcoin becomes big enough then such claims will be taken seriously as any other dispute would.)

My company is a multi-billion dollar technology company, and if we released a product without patents, we would be sued to oblivion. Therefore we get pattents so our lawyers can show up to the cock fight, slap down a stack of papers, and call a cease fire.\n\nIn my industry, trade secrets, infrastructure, and time to market are actually as valuable or even more valuable than patents.\n\nLike all things, if there is no demand for a particular service, the market doesn't work on solutions. So too with patentless innovation. There is no need for it today, in our society, because you can file an application to outsource your physical coercion to prevent someone from doing something. As long as society finds the use of force against others acceptable in protecting your work, no one will innovate to find creative ways to protect profits from innovation without the use of force. \n\nIn a world without patents, ideas are not an economic good, but the capital to implement the ideas are. In the case of Trezor, the hardware manufacturers stand to profit from the sale of their hardware. It would be in their interest to fund the development of applications which require their hardware.\n\nAlternatively, a consortium of merchants, who stand to benefit from reduced transaction fees, might find it worthwhile to encourage adoption by making a hardware wallet that has special privileges at only consortium locations. Perhaps they could bundle a special signing chip with the open source software, that's sole function is to verify membership in the consortium. Membership in the consortium could be contractually enforced (i.e. voluntary). \n\nEven better, a solution might be found by someone more clever than I am to capture this entirely as a trade secret - auditable code with a secret that has the ability to control access to something, but can be verified to have no ability to do malicious attacks.\n\nI don't know the answer, and it is possible that the market wouldn't find a satisfactory solution in every case.

The infrastructure for market based solutions also doesn't exist. The history and cultural acceptance of market based solutions doesn't exist. Society needs to change for these sorts of solutions to work (i.e. they need the support of Walmart, Amazon, etc.). I also don't expect Slush to go out and sue people for copyright infringement.
