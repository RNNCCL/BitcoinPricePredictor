A typical merchant payment transaction will have one input address, the amount to be taken from it, one output address, the amount to be sent to it, and the fee amount (difference of the two).  The miners then will append to that transaction the updated balances of the two addresses and the pointers to their previous uses.\n\nI am not sure I understand your scenario.  Someone gets a large amount deposited to his address X, then, *without waiting for the deposit to be confirmed,* issues many "checks"  to different merchants.  Is that it?  Indeed, in that case a miner may ignore some or all of the checks, for insufficent funds, if he looks at them before considering the deposit.  But, again, the client asked for that trouble.  If the bounced checks are returned to the queue for a while, they will eventually clear, after the deposit gets confirmed.  What is wrong in that?': 2, 'PS. I suspect that the reason for the UTXO based accounting may be that Satoshi wanted a digital version of *cash*, rather than a distributed *bank*.  UTXOs would be the digital version of banknotes.

If a banknote is larger than what you want to pay, you give the whole banknote and get another banknote as change back.  And so on.\n\nBut the analogy breaks down because bitcoin "banknotes" had to be divsible and joinable, so momentarily they are "liquefied" like money in a bank account.

Requiring inputs to be UTXOs instead of addresses simplified the programing a bit (perhaps, not sure yet) but created that totally unnecessary complication for wallet software, that of keeping tract of UTXOs and selecting them.
