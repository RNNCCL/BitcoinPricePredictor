Currently the block reward is 25 bitcoins, this serves as the incentive for miners to mine. \n\nThere is a fixed amount of space for transactions in each block so the fees let miners prioritize which transactions make it into a block - the reasons for this are two fold: \n\n1. Prevent people from spamming the network - eg flooding it with many transactions preventing others from using the network, because it costs money to do that - if there were no fees it would cost nothing to clog the network.\n\n2. Transition from block reward to transaction fees, because the block reward decreases over time.\n\nThe total incentive to mine is the block reward + fees. As time goes on the block reward eventually decreases to zero (very soon the block reward will drop from 25 btc to 12.5 btc, however by the year 2140 the reward is expected to decrease to 0 btc this is called [Controlled Supply](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Controlled_supply)), so the fees people pay will ultimately replace the incentive for miners to mine. I'm quoting directly from the satoshi white paper:\n\n> The incentive can also be funded with transaction fees. If the output value of a transaction is\nless than its input value, the difference is a transaction fee that is added to the incentive value of\nthe block containing the transaction. Once a predetermined number of coins have entered\ncirculation, the incentive can transition entirely to transaction fees and be completely inflation\nfree.\n\ntl;dr the fees prevent spam transactions, and will ultimately serve as the incentive for miners to mine according to the initial [satoshi white paper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf).": 1, 'What the other answers perhaps have not made clear is that miners choose which transactions to include in the blocks they mine.  And (if successful) they get all the fees of all the transactions in the block.  \n\nSo the bigger the fee you pay, the more likely miners will choose your transaction for their blocks.': 1, 'Is there an estimate how much miners are currently making from fees? For example, in comparison to block reward?': 1, 'When you post a bitcoin transaction to the network, it contains a message showing the fund transfers like "take 0.702btc from address1, and give 0.3btc to address2 and 0.4btc to address3".  Notice that there is an extra 0.002btc that doesn\'t get given to a recipient.  This is a fee that gets collected by whoever mines the block containing this transaction.\n\nIf you post a transaction with no fee or a fee that is too small, miners will have very little incentive to include your transaction in the next block.  If you include a larger than average fee, your transaction will be very likely to be included in the next block because the miners will want to receive that fee.\n\nMiners receive bitcoin two ways when they mine a block.  They get  the "block reward", which started out at 25BTC and halves periodically.  They also get all the fees associated with the block they mine.  Eventually (about 2024) the block reward will be eliminated, and miners will only receive the fees.  When a miner mines a block, they include an address in it to which all the rewards and fees go.  \n\nWhen you are attempting to mine a block, it\'s in your interest to get as many fees as you can per amount of work you perform.  If there are more pending transactions than will fit within a block, you naturally will want to include the ones with larger fees in preference to smaller fees.

You're still making someone else money, just on a pathetic scale that's not worth it for you.\n\nThey were amazing when it first started out, because not too many people were wanting to put money in and risk, while they were experimenting with what it was and how it worked. Who would want to deposit $100 just to see how it worked and risk sending the wrong amount (all of it) or not having anything to spend it on. Instead a few people took the risk by trading off ad hits for letting people get some little lint out of their pocket. This was still a useless amount back then, but the good part was the amount shifted with time to still stay connected to regular fiat currency like USD. So if a bitcoin was only $10 for 1.0, they'd pay you 0.001 bitcoin for the claim (Just the 1c for the ad hit). Forward to now, and they do the same thing but still giving you 1c worth. The only upside back then was early adopters before the bitcoin price climbed those 1c value are worth more because the value is 40x more expensive. So if you never did spend you have 40c per claim, etc.\n\nUnless bitcoin climbs another factor higher... not going to make you anything, you're spending more money on electricity and internet and your daylight hours than you'll ever get.\n\nThat said, if you're new and just want to see how a transaction propagates through the network, it's a fine start. Get a wallet, get an address, go to faucet sites. They should only require a single field of an address to paste in. There's no way for them to scam you in that case. They either send you money or they don't. Some, since they're in such small amounts of payments, to save on the fee's eating 100% of that amount up or failing to send, they make you create a small account (just username/email and password) and then after you reach a certain number of payouts you can have it send to your wallet then.

The miners prefer to process the transactions where they will collect the highest fees. Bitcoin protocol currently only allows a miner to process 1MB worth of transactions when they mine a block, and so we call this the "Blocksize." Obviously this means lower fee transactions will be processed last, and in many cases are pushed to the next block or otherwise aren\'t processed in a timely manner. A transaction with 0 fee is valid, there\'s just no incentive to process it and it\'ll probably stay in the pool of pending transactions (called mempool) until it\'s processed (or dropped).\n\nIt seems like it would be useful to increase the fee for a \'stuck\' transaction due to a low fee (miners don\'t want to include it in their block because other transactions are worth more to them and they only have 1MB of space to work with).\n\nReplace-by-fee simply allows a user to rebroadcast that transaction with an additional fee, making it more likely that a miner will include it in their next block. This is now recently possible and so wallets like Electrum have started to implement the front-end UI to do this action.\n\nThe controversy is two fold:\n\n1. Blocksize could be increased and we wouldn\'t have to fight (as much) over which transactions are priority, because more would fit into a block. Some people don\'t want to do this because they think a \'fee market\' is important (ensuring miners continue to make money from fees for processing transactions).\n\n2.

Thus fees can\'t really reasonably solve it. I can think of two ways they could: motivate people not to use bitcoin as much (which IMHO hurts bitcoin itself) or be the fees so high that miners will be motivated to increase their hashrate every difficulty change, so that blocks get generated every X < 10 mins :-).\n\nFees are the mechanism by which transactions are prioritized. It\'s cheap and easy to get your transaction into the blockchain. You only need to pay a little more than the attacker is paying.

The point of it is that it makes it cheap to spend old outputs and relatively expensive to create new outputs. The intended outcome is that the size of the unspent transaction output (UTXO) set is reduced, which is a good thing since full nodes need to keep the UTXO highly available to validate incoming transactions.\n\n> 13) Bitcoin will perish if we can\'t keep it running and credible.\n\n> Allright.

Imagine a room where to talk to someone you have to tell everyone in the room what you are saying. When there is a small number of people in the room, no problem. As more people enter, it starts to get bad. Then you need to splinter into small groups or other forms of communication. This is what we have in Bitcoin today, a broadcast system where everyone shouts every transaction at everyone else. It works up to a point, but it's totally stupid to try and make it keep working forever. \n\nWe can already see that there isn't much headroom for growth in the shouting model, as you say, maybe a small constant at most. So before we waste that safety margin on a dumb plan like just keep kicking the can down the road and procrastinating the real solutions that everyone knows we need eventually, we should first not be lazy and make sure we gave the near term smart compromise options like SegWit a real chance.\n": 8, "Bitcoin is under psychological attack from people who cannot understand why raising the block size limit is not a solution to Bitcoin's scaling problem, is that correct?": -1, "They must be part of the civilized conversation camp.

GUI power users are stepped on so hard by the desktop GUIs nobody wants to put up with it. You can't even arrange the start menu how you want without onerous amount of time and work editing text files, among a lot of other annoyances, but that's not the worst part.\n\nBasically no part of the GUI, from the custom context menu commands in Dolphin for instance to the custom quick launch commands lines, allows command line arguments. They are simply truncated. This essentially makes it manifestly impossible to transfer any of the power of the command line to the GUI in any systematic way. Too many people aren't interested in a steep learning curve to accomplish what should be over in two clicks for the sake of being uber Linux users. Not due to any lack of intelligence, but due to differing priorities. \n\nThe developers even rub salt in the wound with a whole host of absurd statements. Including 'babysitting grandpa,' 'GUIs don't understand command lines,' etc. When you try to point out the issues they insist that allowing users to include command line args and such in their custom commands by not truncating them is somehow extra features, when in fact is the removal of a feature, via extra sanitation code, of what makes a computer a computer. They will claim it is a feature included in '.desktop' shortcuts (scripts), which do allow it. Only it's not only not an extra feature, merely a feature of all computers they didn't go through the extra trouble of disabling, it's impossible to have desktop shortcut (script) that is context sensitive, through parent/child relationships, to the particular action you want to take with some file/program.\n\nI learned the hard way that the only way to fix this issue is to start from scratch and rewrite everything. I made shell scripts to play as an interpreter to provide a GUI with a generalized way to interact with command lines. Including windows filetype handling and such. I ran my windows based GUI application, used on my windows machine for the same general goal, under Wine. But no matter how hard I tried the existing desktop simply refused to allow it.\n\nI spent time in various Linux desktop forums and seen where people were constantly requesting/complaining about not being able to do this or that special case. While being told 'learn the command line' when they obviously already knew the command line they needed and that this feature was denied, required too much work to address their special case, and not open for discussion. Yet the common feature of all these special case request was that they all had the same general solution. Quit truncating the command line switches in the custom commands within the GUI!\n\nIf they would get off their high horse with that one issue I could and would transform the Linux desktop into an awesome beast that would transform the entire desktop market for Linux. But I'm not going to waste my time working alone starting an entirely new desktop system from scratch just to fix the stupidity, and I am not going to waste hours, even months depending on the task, on a Linux box doing simple crap that should be over in a few clicks. As much as I love the Linux subsystem it's simply not worth it.": 4, 'I know right...

I spent a couple of years going through every distro with every desktop variant I could find hoping to find something I could build off of. This was after investing months in developing scripts and a GUI with an open ended range of functions that was distro independent. LXDE came the closest in terms of personal taste but no cigar. Pcmanfm was also my favorite at the time, but it to had the same fatal flaw. Never used caja. I gave up before its time.\n\nI actually considered writing my own file manager and using it as a substitute for the desktop itself. But I had already invested so much time in the hopes of having a productive Linux setup,  to be stymied at every turn, that I just wanted to shoot it with a shotgun by then. The bottom line is that I can put up with a lot of absurdity in limited GUI options, but the one thing that is absolutely fatal is when custom command lines are not allowed within the GUI or the command line switches are truncated by the GUI. At that point Linux gets dumped into /dev/null. \n\nOf course people generally don\'t want an options overload. My objective was not to create a vast set of options for a user to gander at in wonder and confusion. It was more a means of allowing any option, or any feature granted by a command line plus switches, to be trivially in a unified manner added as a GUI accessible option. The defaults, and what the user is subjected to on the surface, would be far more modest. Any power user that then learned something about the command line could then trivially, using a unified scheme, add those features into the GUI in a context sensitive manner. My personal choices would not fit well with a general audience either, but a community of power users could distill out a default set of settings and predefined options that is better suited a general audience. Not something that needs me creating options pages for or trying to unilaterally shove down the pipes. The rest of the power awaits the users learning curve to catch up, or them seeing some power user tip with instructions on the internet and saying "I want that." Making the full range of GUI options an extension of the command line learning curve itself.\n\nThis GUI system I wanted on Linux I have already implemented on windows, and completely replaced the Open With and filetype association of windows with it. The command line system it employs is far better suited for Linux, but the existing Linux desktop simply will not allow it. This same tiny app that does all the handling also opens drawers of options from the windows toolbar on the taskbar. It also allows me to plug it into a programmers text editor with only a single run/compile command and have that run/compile command open up drawers of options to switch compilers, compiler options, editors, viewers, etc. All while piping the stdin/stdout/stderr streams back to the text editor or wherever they are needed/wanted. Such configuration options are implicit, not something a user is explicitly faced with to confuse them, and open ended like the command line itself. I haven\'t even thought of all the use cases, or potential options available, to my own system. I couldn\'t list them all if I tried. \n\nAs far as I\'m concerned a GUI system needs to be as modular and extensible as a collection of command line programs. The file manager may have a default file properties display, and if the user doesn\'t know they can swap that properties display element of the GUI with another option, with the same file manager, then they just don\'t know. There is no options page with list of properties displays to choose from. But when they do know they can choose to swap just that element from a third party or even one they created themselves. If I have a picture browser it may be associated with a default picture viewer. But I should be able to switch to the viewer of my choice without switching the picture browser, or even switch to being presented with a list of viewers/browsers/editors to choose from. Again without overloading the user with options pages to confuse them. Such options should be implicit, not explicit, and simple to implement. Linux also needs a unified mouse mapping system. Linux kills it with keyboard options but makes users want to bash their mouse with a hammer. Even the capacity to alias key strokes with context sensitive mouse functions would solve *almost* all those issues. But Linux desktop developers seem to view the mouse as some kind of dildo. Only a dildo is likely more functional than a mouse on Linux.\n\n***\n\nAnyway, all my Linux GUI complains would be imminently forgivable but one. The truncating of command line switches within the GUI options. Everything else I would happily be resolving on my own. So unless that changes the entire OS will stay in /dev/null.

Not directly aimed at you, but just a little bit of information I would like to share for anyone still reading..\n\nMy Choice:\n\n[MATE](http://mate-desktop.org/) with caja replaced with [pcmanfm](http://wiki.lxde.org/en/PCManFM) for some of the reasons you have stated. I use a lot of other programs on top of these which work best for me, most of my core system is from the MATE set excluding caja. I could go on and on and talk about how I use Debian and everyone should bootstrap their systems from scratch, but that is not what everyone needs and is not a fair point to focus on. The average user demands a simple tool that gets the job done efficiently and in the least amount of time and money, I think that Linux can accomplish this on multiple levels, but I would agree that it falls short on accomplishing it on all levels.\n\n\n* [Chrome OS](https://www.google.com/chromebook/): Walk into a store today and buy one cheaper than any any other new computer. It will satisfy your web browsing needs as well as most media needs. So simple grandma could do it..\n* [Elementary OS](https://elementary.io/): on par with a macbook on simplicity and layout, quite stable and visually appealing out of the box. Free of charge but donation is really shoved in your face here, just click custom, $0, and you have it.\n* [Linux Mint](https://linuxmint.com/): This is currently the most popular Linux distribution, it's simple and easy, but it doesn't cover up all of the rough edges like Elementary OS does. Here you will be given multiple option for a default environment. This is unlike the above two options and if choices and decisions are not your thing then maybe the is the farthest you will venture into the world of Linux, but that's fine.\n\nNow a list of the actual options that are covered up by the various Linux distributions. I use [Debian](https://www.debian.org/) because I do use the command line and I really like apt and have become accustomed to it. They have also proven to keep their system one of the most stable in existence. Debian alone is not a user friendly place to start and most of the options provided are also provided in other distributions. These options can be installed on nearly any Linux system with a few steps (yes, likely involving the command line and maybe editing a text file or two if there is not a distribution that ships with the option as default).\n\n\n* [Gnome](https://www.gnome.org/gnome-3/): The newest version of the classic Linux desktop left a lot of fans behind. It favors a crossover style interface that works well on touchscreen devices and is intuitive and usable on a desktop. Many users dislike the interface mainly due to the fact that it feels so different. It is worth a try anyway, this is the parent to many other environments like Unity, Cinnamon, and Pantheon.\n* [Cinnamon](https://linuxmint.com/): Default in the main release of Linux mint. Very user friendly and more similar to a layout like Windows 7 in terms of menu and usability.\n* [Pantheon](https://elementary.io/): This is a very user friendly version of Gnome 3, Even if you have tried Gnome 3 and don't like it I would suggest trying pantheon anyway. I can see this desktop environment making Linux on the desktop a real end user choice.\n* [Unity](http://unity.ubuntu.com/): This environment was [Ubuntu's](http://www.ubuntu.com/) response to Gnome 3, and was designed for usage on desktops as well as touch screens without the level of compromise given in Gnome 3. Unity was also designed to be portable to a mobile platform and is used on the Ubuntu phone system. Unity is stable and generally a friendly environment for a Linux newcomer, though it will not feel much like any other system you have used.\n* [KDE Plasma](https://www.kde.org/workspaces/plasmadesktop/): This is another mature environment. It features an entire kit of software specifically for the desktop. It is an extension on the [Qt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qt_(software)) programming language. This desktop may appeal to many die hard windows users, the desktop is advanced and contains many options and visual effects. There also seems to be no need to use a command line to edit anything though I cannot say for sure because I never used it as a daily desktop.\n* [MATE](http://www.mate-desktop.org/): This is a continuation of the Gnome 2 desktop which was the absolute most used Linux desktop of all time. It is fairly configurable, visually appealing and user friendly. There shouldn't be a need for command line usage here and there are a few distributions that ship MATE as default including Linux Mint. MATE is also fairly friendly in terms of system resource usage and is typically a great middle ground for a power user that wants a *nice* desktop without too much compromise.\n* [LXDE](http://lxde.org/): This is a great option for the power user. It is somewhat visually appealing, but also is very low on system resource usage. You will need to use the command line at some point if you want this desktop to operate the way you want, but there is a lot of room for writing scripts as most features of the desktop do contain CLI augment options that are reasonable to the tasks. This desktop uses my preferred file manager as default, pcmanfm.\n* [XFCE](http://www.xfce.org/): Another desktop that holds to a lightweight standard. This desktop is simple and visually appealing for a lightweight environment. This system is more friendly than LXDE but a little more intensive in its resource usage.\n* [Enlightenment](https://www.enlightenment.org/): A very lightweight environment I never felt at home in. It is stable and has been in development a long time, great when system resources are a major concern.\n* [Budgie](https://solus-project.com/): Very new and looks interesting, I haven't tried it and maybe I will now that it has a stable release.\n\n\n\nI think one of the causes of Linux on the desktop on becoming more mainstream is that most people don't want such a list of options. They also want to buy a computer the way they want it, not spend a few hours or more making it the way they want later. If a store like best buy setup a table of identical laptops with OSX, Windows 10, Chrome, Elementary OS, Linux Mint, and Ubuntu on each with a price tag that reflects the hardware cost plus the software cost then I think OSX and Windows 10 would lose a few customers and companies that write much of the proprietary software that people gripe about not being available on Linux would start releasing for Linux as well.\n\nI believe that Linux will not win the desktop war soon, and even if it does it will not be what I envisioned five or more years ago. We will get a lot more like Chrome OS before we get a power users environment out of the box from a large corporation, and till then windows will hold its GUI power user base and Linux will be developed primarily by, and for, the Linux CLI users.\n\n**Shout out to Valve for Steam OS based on Debian Linux, lots more Linux games and letting me buy them all with Bitcoin!!**": 1, 'If only there was another company that made Unix-based, consumer friendly, popular computers, laptops and smartphones...': 3, 'Or localbitcoins.
