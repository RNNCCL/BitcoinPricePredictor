But there's many other things that can be done to address the drug problem besides prohibition.\n\nFor one, there's an African root/drug called Ibogaine that has the effect of resetting the brain's chemical (not psychological) addiction to bypass withdrawal.  It's called Ibogaine, but it is classified as a schedule 1 drug because of its hallucinogenic properties.  No one in their right mind would use it as a recreational drug because it's side effects includes vomiting and incapacitation for a few days.  Treatment centers can be found in Canada and Mexico. (Note that this is not a catch all, as there's still a psychological predilection to drug use, so these centers offer counseling as well.)\n\nAnother is to address child abuse.  There's a high correlation between childhood abuse and addiction indicating that trauma actually damages the brain and when people use drugs later in life, they get a taste of what it is to feel normal.  Thus these people end up chasing that high that un-abused people need not chase.  So, if child abuse can be addressed another large portion of the drug problem can be abated (in a generation or so).\n\n[The Bomb in the Brain](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLB3F2CF45EEB95C80) - Libertarian philosopher does an excellent job of listing the dangers of child abuse, if you wish to research further.\n\nAnother interesting aspect is [Portugal's drug decriminalization](https://www.google.com/#q=portugal+drug+decriminalization).

Without a valuable currency rewarding the miners (new coins or coins from fees), there is no hashing power, which means there is no security. A blockchain without a valuable currency is useless because it can be attacked easily.\n- Bitcoin is not just a payment system, it's also sound money, a store of value. In fact, I'd say store of value will be (or already is IMO) its best use case. Satoshi has spoken several times about Bitcoin as digital gold. See his thought experiment about an imaginary, boring but scarce metal.\n- The blockchain only makes sense for building a decentralized network. It doesn't make sense for a centralized entity like a country to create its own Bitcoin clone, because it would have to create its own mining industry to protect it from other competing or enemy centralized entities.

They would issue the loan, hand it off to a securitizer to package it into an MBS to be sold to woefully uninformed investors (who themselves are partly to blame for sure). This is a HUGE reason why 2008/2009 happened--the banks no longer bore the risk of the crap loans they were originating and just churned out as much as they could to maximize earned fees.\n\nSecond, the 'TARP got repaid' theme is EXTREMELY misleading. Yes, it did, but this was only possible because of a laundry list of other bail-outs that the banks received at taxpayer expense. Some examples:\n\n1) Goldman and others receiving tens of billons of dollars through a Fed-orchestrated decision to honor those banks' positions w/ AIG dollar for dollar. Normally, if a company like AIG goes bankrupt (which they were, spectacularly), their counterparties would recover little to nothing, maybe cents on the dollar. Goldman and others got 100% of their positions with AIG covered, with taxpayer money.\n\n2) A program (can't remember the acronym off-hand) that allowed the banks to issue government-guaranteed debt, driving down their borrowing costs\n\n3) Quantitative easing (money printing) is itself a MASSIVE bailout of the banks--literally flooding their coffers with free cash, that they can either loan out or just keep parked with the Fed and earn a small amount of interest on. Also, part of QE involved buying back the 'toxic' securities from the banks. The Fed now owns those practically worthless securities, meaning we're the ones eating those losses.\n\nThis is just a partial list.

It _rewards_ hoarding.\n\nIn the case of Bitcoin, it's more of a psychological and predictive question: Will the price go up? Yes, but if everyone hoards the currency, it loses its liquidity and as a result its demand and value. Nobody wants to support a currency nobody uses.

The only place I'm aware of where it's still used as a medium of exchange is in Vietnam for real estate deals, yet the monetary value of global gold reserves is something like $8trillion, many multiples of it's industrial use value. Just because a currency isn't traded a lot or often used in exchange doesn't directly affect it's utility as a store-of-value. Now in the case of bitcoin, I'll grant you that there is an indirect correlation, since it's an indicator of adoption, but it's hoarding that actually gives it value - the fact that lots of people want to hold it in reserve and are willing to exchange value to do so, just as with gold or any other currency for that matter.\n\nPut another way, liquidity can't be decreased because too many people want to hold onto something.

It\'s based on the idea of commitments and ECDSA private key leaks to create single use minting addresses; if someone tries to double-mint, every observer can get the private key and "steal" the funds from the account.\n\nNote that knowledge of the private key is not chain-specific, it can exist outside of any chain - which is closer to a convergent system than is a system which "depends on the very history it is trying to form to enforce loss of value."\n\nSuch a system probably would have distribution issues, and premine is the mark of a shitcoin, so I\'d recommend bootstrapping it from Bitcoin or another established crypto currency.': 5, 'Thanks for your kind response.\n\nDistributed consensus is a new field and has many nuances that are difficult to fully appreciate.

For single-chain Proof-of-Stake it seems to be easy to enhance Backbone's model and get same results. The point is all known ways to enforce participants to build single-chain only are tricky and have unclear consequences because of hard-to-analyze mix of consensus & economics properties.  That's why we (https://github.com/ConsensusResearch) went into investigation of Proof-of-Stake with contribution to multiple forks allowed.

You say: "We showed that by depending only on resources within the system, proof of stake cannot be used to form a **distributed consensus**, since it depends on the very history it is trying to form to enforce loss of value."\n\nThis conclusion relies very much on a wrong interpretation of **distributed consensus**, which was earlier defined in the paper as: \n"A distributed consensus, as the term is used in Bitcoin, is a consensus (i.e. global agreement) between many mutually-distrusting parties who lack identities and were not necessarily present at the time of system set up."\n\nThis definition is unclear and leaves too much room for different interpretations. New Bitcoin users have to trust their downloaded Bitcoin-Software to have the correct genesis block message and the correct checkpoints.\nTherefore you must agree that the bootstrapping of new clients in Bitcoin anyway involves a certain trust and is not completely in accordance with your definition ("**mutually-distrusting parties**"). Therefore if you want to define **distributed consensus**, as the term is used in Bitcoin, you must exclude the bootstrapping of new clients anyway.\n\nThe definition of **distributed consensus** in Bitcoin just means that peers who have been once in agreement with the other distrusting parties will stay in agreement.

If you\'re sending or receiving coins it is easy to ask the other party what his or her genesis block is to confirm that you are using the same chain; for each genesis block (with sufficient hashpower, I suppose) there will be consensus on what the "true chain" beginning with that block is, so it\'s sufficient that transacting parties agree on this blockhash (which is static, so not dependent on any universal time ordering) for them to know that they both have the same view of the network as any other participant.\n\nI agree that in practice users trust that the genesis block hardcoded into their client is the correct one, and that in principle if there were multiple "Bitcoin" genesis blocks floating around that there would be no way in principle to distinguish them without finding some trusted source to ask.\n\nBut what Bitcoin seeks to obtain is a distributed consensus on the history starting with block `000000000019d6689c085ae165831e934ff763ae46a2a6c172b3f1b60a8ce26f`, since this blockhash is part of Bitcoin itself and changing it means you are on some other system.

With my comment, I just wanted to highlight that your definition and interpretation of distributed consensus is not how it should be ideally defined.\n\nFor me distributed consensus means that the system keeps clients in consensus over time if they were in consensus at an earlier time. Therefore I think PoS achieves distributed consensus. If you want to refer to the capability of Bitcoin to bootstrap new clients without Trust, then I think you should name that differently and not "distributed consensus". Maybe something like "trustless bootstrapping". And then one could highlight exactly the theoretical problems of this trustless bootstrapping using either PoW (trust in genesis and checkpoints and seed-nodes) or PoS (additional trust that very old keys were not published and used to create a fork).

However, if someone really wanted to, it is possible to prove that you were given the correct genesis block by comparing the amount of work preformed on every chain that people tell you about and seeing which one has the most absolute work, assuming that you are able to communicate with at least one honest node that knows The Truth. As mining becomes a larger industry, it also becomes easier to show that a minimum amount of time must have elapsed since a given block, based on physical limits. If that block also happens to contain a piece of information that you personally know could have only been known after a certain point in time, you also know the maximum amount of time that could have elapsed since a block was created. Using this information, you can make a fairly decent guess about whether or not you were told about the concenus chain *even if nobody tells you about the concenus chain*.

The problem with Brainwallets is you must provide the random entropy yourself if you want a secure wallet. And humans are notoriously bad at coming up with truly random data. There are computers running 24/7 that work to crack Brainwallets with poor randomness. As computers get more powerful and bitcoin becomes more valuable, the issues with Brainwallets only gets worse. Those numbers you tagged on the end ought to be generated by rolling dice, and the more rolls the better. I'd do at least 60 dice rolls (60 digits). You only have 5 digits!\n\nThe second issue you have is physical loss. As goes with a paper wallet, what should happen if you lose your paper Brainwallets from theft, flood, or fire? If you only have one copy, then it's very vulnerable to loss. But at the same time if you have multiple copies of your paper Brainwallets, it's easier for an extra copy to find itself into the wrong person's hands. Fortunately should anyone in the physical world stumble upon your Brainwallets, they're unlikely to know what they are or what to do with them. But that's still bad practice.\n\nWhat it sounds like you should do in your case is generate and print off a number of standard paper wallets with BIP38 encryption and load $2-$5 each per paper wallet, then make multiple copies of those paper wallets and store in various safe locations. This method is much more secure because someone would need physical access to your paper wallets to crack them (whereas people all over the world right this moment are attempting to crack your Brainwallet and everyone else's), and even with a mediocre password BIP38 is expensive and time consuming to brute force.\n\nI highly recommend you go here and make some paper wallets and transfer over those Brainwallet coins. https://bitcoinpaperwallet.com/": 1, '119$ and you can get a ledger instead for around half of that': 1, 'For 2.1 BTC, a Ledger may be more appropriate.': 1, 'electrum.org.\n\nWhatever you choose to do, do it with a small amount first.

Press button -> Print -> Press button -> Print etc.\n\nThere is also a readme.txt file which tells you what to do plus importantly gives you the Firmware version: 1.1 which is useful if you have to flash new firmware.

I know it sounds a bit counter-intuitive saying that bitcoin is  a good fit to pieces of paper, but they really are an excellent way of storing bitcoin in a very secure manner, bit like making your own bearer bonds, plus with Mycelium Android wallet you can spend from these pieces of paper in whole or in part, either transferring value from the paper to your mobile or via your mobile to a third party. If you carry a couple of empty ones round with you then you can load them up on an ad hoc basis and give them away to people who can treat them like a bearer bond.\n\nIf you have (say) 10 BTC then you can make 10 x 1 BTC or 20 x 0.5 BTC or 1 x 10 BTC which you can then load up with more BTC, or spend all or some of it, or suck some on to your mobile if you are going out etc. You can write down on each piece of paper what it's worth but no need because your mobile will always scan it and tell you.\n\nTips: When you generate a jpg if your printer is attached to your PC it will ask if you want to open the USB storage and view/print the jpg. This is not the way to do it, you should disconnect your PC before you generate the keypair and ask the printer to print the jpg. Lastly if you fetch in some BTC from cold storage then technically it is better to fetch it all, regard that private key as compromised and throw it away and, since you can print perfectly secure paper wallets all day and night, why not? Someone will correct me if I'm wrong on that. Also it does require you to eject it properly and press the button before removing it, particularly important if you are reflashing the firmware.\n\nIn future I would like to see a paper wallet design app for Entropy that uses the keys generated as variables in your own layout but in the meantime I would try and get your hands on one by hook or by crook as this is such a small market I can't see them making them again for a while. It certainly feels safer than having bitcoins on-line in Armory and much less complicated and much much quicker and much cheaper and simpler than Trezor.
