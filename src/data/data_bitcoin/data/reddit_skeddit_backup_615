I know one side of the coin, but not the other. Please correct me if this is incorrect.*\n\nFrom my point of view, there\'s 2 kinds of people in the market. Long-Term Holders, and Traders. Obviously this is an over-generalization, but those are the two major categories.\n\n**Long-term Holders Buying Habits**\n\nThis is a group that pretty much only buy, rarely, if ever sell. I\'m in this group. I think they generally believe in the long-term outlook of bitcoin, and are in it for the long haul. We\'re not traders by nature, but we like hearing bitcoin news. We tend to buy near local minimums. We like to increase our position for as cheap as possible, since our end-goal isn\'t really changing.\n\n**Traders Buying Habits**\n\nTraders are a different breed. They come in all shapes in sizes. Some think similarly to Holders that bitcoin is the future. Their goal is to increase their position by buying low and selling high, in order to re-buy near the bottom. They like increasing their *BTC* position. Then there\'s the "bears" as we like to call them, or people who think bitcoin is doomed. They like to sell high as well, but ultimately are looking to get out after making a few bucks. They are looking to increase their *cash* position.\n\n**What happened today?**\n\nBasically, there was big rumors of an exchange coming through, which we now know as Coinbase Exchange. Assuming this is a major US exchange, the price really only goes up, as people can buy more easily, but few are likely to transfer in a lot and sell. On the rumor, people anticipated the market shifting upward, and bought in. Hence the price increase leading up to the announcement.\n\nThen the announcement hits, and the price is STILL going up. Some holders may be jumping in, thinking "To the moon!" is coming. They buy and the price goes up and up. Traders are also establishing long positions, the whole reason they bought anyway. Bear and Bulls alike are setting up longs.\n\nThe price reaches $300, and the volume starts getting thin. There\'s no longer massive walls holding up the price, so volatility increases a lot. Some traders decide to get out, thinking this might be the top, so the price stabilizes for a short while. Others, sensing the stagnation, know the price is going to retrace a bit, as 50% growth is just not sustainable. Shorts are established. Everyone plays a game, trying not to be [the greater fool](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_fool_theory), and is getting out. The price begins to retreat.\n\nNo one has confidence that the market will support a $300 price, since the trip there was so brief. No one wants to buy now because the price stopped going up. Bears are shorting, bulls are selling at the top to re-buy, and holders have stopped buying. This creates a retracement as you will see people say.\n\nNow we\'re left with this volatile price while no one knows where the price is "supposed" to be. All we really know was that $210 was too low, and over $300 was too high. The market is struggling to find where that "even" point is. Everyone is making guesses now, and the price is going up and down a lot as people are buying/selling amounts trying to get in and out of the market. Everyone is trying to make money, but some people make more money when the market goes down. Others sell at the top, and increase BTC position when the price falls, so they aren\'t exactly unhappy either.\n\nThe only real worries come from Holders, who just want to see the price go up. Traders love volatility. The more volatile, the more money you can make. If the price is wavering $5-$10... there\'s not a lot they can do. If it\'s going up and down by 10% on the hour, they can make a ton off that 10% EACH hour if they call it correctly. More money to be made.\n\nIt\'s the ebb and flow of the market and human (ir)rationality. Right now, everyone is just trying to figure out what the right price is, and trying to make money in the process.\n\n**How do you know all this? You don\'t even trade!**\n\nI don\'t. But I read a lot of /r/bitcoinmarkets and watch the markets closely. I don\'t trust myself enough to predict the future, but I\'ve gotten to a point where I feel like I can explain the past/present.\n\nHopefully that helps explain it for you!': 4, 'Moon': 3, 'A = A': 2, 'I would speculate, this shell of a page, was just to get their name out there prior to the Winklevoss ETF news later today.

For example this is among the proposed NY BitLicense regulations:\n\n>As part of its anti-money laundering compliance program, each firm shall maintain the following information for all transactions involving the payment, receipt, exchange or conversion, purchase, sale, transfer, or transmission of Virtual Currency: (1) the identity and physical addresses of the parties involved; (2) the amount or value of the transaction, including in what denomination purchased, sold, or transferred, and the method of payment; (3) the date the transaction was initiated and completed, and (4) a description of the transaction.\n\nThere's nothing stopping a friend who has a BTC account from buying/selling on your behalf, but they won't be able to keep your BTC or USD in their accounts.

The bank has to know how many insured accounts and accounts exceeding the insured amount there are in order to comply with FDIC rules.\n\nIn any case, the bank is hardly the only one keeping the exchange honest. Major investors (like NYSE for example) as well as SEC regulations require frequent audits, with an outside accounting firm investigating for abuses. CPAs will be required to keep the day-to-day books and will be criminally liable if they sign off on illegal activities. \n\nThere will be completely separate accounts used for Coinbase doing business (like paying its employees, renting offices, etc.) and for client deposits (and actually yet another for client withdrawals but let's not get lost in the nitty gritty of corporate balance sheet mechanics). So it will be impossible for Coinbase to use client funds for operational purposes without it being instantly apparent to financial regulators and auditors.

However, in the US, the deposited USD funds at the bank are not considered an asset of the exchange. It never belongs to the exchange so it can't be used to satisfy the exchange's obligations. The exchange is technically an agent of the customer, placing a deposit on their behalf and acting as custodian thereof. Brokered deposits like that can get a little funky if there is some element of pooling or investment, like if the exchange provided a market-based return on deposits. But since the exchange is just sitting on the cash and not doing anything with it, there is little doubt that its role is exclusively custodial.

": 10, 'I am sure. Broker-dealers that offer intermediary deposit services like this are eligible for what\'s called "pass-through" coverage. PayPal and investment banks take advantage of this coverage to provide transaction services to clients. (Note: I cannot ascertain at this time whether Coinbase has registered as a broker-dealer yet, but the company will have to because the SEC has already shut down other exchanges for failing to do so).\n\nEach client\'s funds are treated as an individual account with the bank for FDIC purposes. This insurance only covers the client if the bank itself fails, not the intermediary. So if Coinbase deposits its customers\' funds at Bank of America, then BoA goes bankrupt, the customers will be able to recover losses up to $250k from the FDIC. \n\nNotably the pass-through coverage does not insure depositors in the case that the intermediary fails. So if Coinbase goes bankrupt, the FDIC  isn\'t involved. However, given the nature of the creditor interest created by a deposit with Coinbase and the fiduciary relationship between Coinbase as a broker-dealer and its clients, customers do not need to worry about their funds being taken by superior creditors in a bankruptcy proceeding. Coinbase can\'t use those deposits for its operations, so it can\'t lose the cash itself. And if it takes on too much debt and goes bankrupt, the depositors have absolute superiority over all other creditors when it comes to claiming their own account balances.\n\nBasically it boils down to this: You need FDIC insurance for banks because of the fractional reserve system but you don\'t need it for the exchange itself. Banks **always** carry only a fraction of the cash they need to satisfy all of their debts at any one time. If all the depositors claim their cash from the bank at once, you have a run on the bank resulting in a liquidity crisis and then bank failure. A financial intermediary like a BTC exchange doesn\'t have that same necessarily fragile capital structure. The exchange will always have the liquidity to satisfy the demand deposits because the money is sequestered from their normal operations, sitting in nice safe FDIC insured accounts at a bank. \n\nSo FDIC insurance isn\'t necessary for the exchange while it is necessary for the bank. ': 2, "That's not true. PayPal itself is not insured, but deposits with PayPal are covered by FDIC pass-through insurance. That means the depositor is insured if the bank where PayPal deposits customers' funds fails, but not if PayPal itself fails. \n\nCoinbase will be able to provide the same pass-through coverage if and when it registers as a broker-dealer. I can't find information about whether Coinbase has registered yet or plans to register. A cursory search of the SEC registry does not show that it has. However, it eventually will have to register because the SEC has already shut down another BTC exchange for failing to register as a broker-dealer. \n\nAnyway, once pass-through coverage is established, if the bank at which a client's funds are deposited goes bankrupt, the client is covered up to $250k just as if they had opened a checking account at the bank.\n\nIn the event of a Coinbase bankruptcy, depositors' claims over their own accounts will have absolute priority. (I don't have time to go into the mind-fuckery that is secured transactions and creditor priority in bankruptcy proceedings, but suffice to say there is no way a third-party claimant could take possession of the deposited funds to satisfy Coinbase's debt). So there's no need for insurance against a Coinbase bankruptcy.\n\nAll that only applies to the USD deposits. I am unsure what would happen with the BTC deposits held by Coinbase, but I think we all are aware that the FDIC isn't involved with that side of the business. \n\nSmall caveat: I'm not positive about how this functions if the customer also happens to have a separate, personal account with the bank. Usually all accounts owned by one person at a single bank are aggregated, so five $50k accounts are covered but only half of two $250k accounts. I don't have time right now to figure out whether the FDIC would aggregate a Coinbase pass-through account and an independent depository account at the same bank, but that may be the case.\n\nEdit: Glanced at the rules, and it seems likely that the FDIC will aggregate individual accounts with exchange accounts. The FDIC aggregates all accounts maintained by or for the benefit of an individual, including those established by an agent (in this case the exchange).\n\nSo bottom line: if Coinbase has deposited client funds with an FDIC insured bank and the bank goes bankrupt, Coinbase customers will be covered up to $250k each.

Before OpenCoin/Ripple Labs existed as a company, it was one of the options that we were looking at to make ripple more decentralized.': 1, 'thanks for your answer!': 1, "Ripple the currency is a trustless decentralised currency like bitcoin (except entirely premined, and unfairly distributed hence most people dont think much of it).\n\nThe other, oft overlooked, but far more important and main part of ripple is the asset exchange that is built in. Any asset exchange requires trust in that if someone sends me a token representing ownership of something (usually an amount of Fiat currency) I have to trust the person that sent me the cryptographic token proving my ownership will actually deliver the physical asset when I ask him too. \n\nWhat ripple facilitates is the spreading of trust along social networks, anyone can set themselves up as an issuer of assets, but no one will trust them except the people that actually know their real world identity and have physical access to the person, so ripple tries to remove this problem. \n\nFor example, Bob wants to issue an IOU onto the network representing the right to $100, to be claimed from him at anypoint in the future. Alice doesnt know bob so wont accept an IOU from him, but Alice knows Jane and Bob knows Jane. So Jane publishes the fact that she trusts BOB to the tune of $100 and Alice publishes the fact that she trusts Jane to the tune of $100. Now when Bob tries to use ripple to send Jane an IOU for $100, ripple the protocol will discover that there is a trusted route from Bob to Jane and the transfer will complete. No actual crypto-currency has been transferred, its a credit money system. However if there is no trust lines to use for the transfer the ripple protocol, falls back on ripple the currency.\n\nBTW I don't like Ripple, some of the ideas have merit, but the implementation and initial distribution is too flawed. Its like a system that could be really good for mankind but has been corrupted at the last hurdle by greed, Not surprised Jed McCaleb left the company and rebooted it as Stellar": 3, "Someone could reimplement all the 'trust rippling' and asset issuance functionality of the ripple payment network on a sidechain to bitcoins blockchain.\n\nRipple the currency as it is currently distributed, will have to stay where it is though. Then Bitcoin, at a fixed exchange rate, could take the role of ripple as the intermediary currency for when no trust lines exist.\n": 1, 'Technically, Ripple *not* trustless, it *is* a web-of-trust. Not only the IOU-rippling, but also the back-end is based on a web-of-trust. You can\'t set up a `rippled` (server) instance without being referred by someone. That\'s how Ripple can have a more real-world-identity-based voting system about the validity of transactions that they call "Consensus", instead of Bitcoin\'s raw CPU-based proof-of-work voting. This just doesn\'t solve the initial distribution problem of the built-in XRP hard currency, hence they have the organization distribute it (pre-"mine" is misleading, there is no mining). Yes it\'s not so nice if you\'re used to Bitcoin already, but probably many people would have found not that bad if Ripple (in its current incarnation) would have existed before Bitcoin (actually Ripple is a concept from 2004, but the first implementations were based on a single server, they never had found a way to actually and technically decentralize it).': 2}, ('Somebody post a video on how Coinbase trading looks like!!!', 37): {'How much informations can you get from the charts?

Then someone came up with paper notes, the guy figured that if the note said it was worth an x amount of some other money, like gold, it'd eliminate many disadvantages of gold as a currency. And it did. Much joy. Then people figured these paper notes may well have also been money, so then paper notes were money. Then, later, the paper note was given a different meaning; instead of 'this paper note is worth an x amount of gold' it said 'this paper note is worth a paper note'. Then computers came running round the corner, and many paper notes started living in there. The computer basically said 'your paper note is in here, I'll give it to you if you say so'. Transfer of these digital paper notes was easy, because it was digital. Printing these digital paper turned out to be even easier, because the owner of the computer could just tell multiple owners of the digital paper notes he was good for it, and continue to use the digital paper notes himself, and lend it out to others with interest. The same has been happening for ages but not with as little friction.

This repeats for a while.\n\nThen Bitcoin came running round the corner. And it's like gold. It's exactly like gold. Except digital. It's not a digital paper note, it's a digital gold. And the next time a digital computer owner lending out the digital gold people trust him with turns out not to have enough digital gold to give to the ones trusting him with it, he will go broke, and lose a lot of money. And the digital gold owners will realize they need to take a modicum of responsibility over the digital gold they're owning.
