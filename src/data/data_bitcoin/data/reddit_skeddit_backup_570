I\'ve argued for years that merchants should be ignoring the day to day prices and focusing on longer-term prices(typically a year-long average, though depending on the business model other averages may be more apropriate, like a quarterly average or a decade average).  Right now this would mean selling their goods at a cheaper than normal price -- but overall the past few years it would usually mean selling at a higher price.\n\nOf course the best way of doing this is probably in the middle of these two extremes; some extra cushion based on the long-term price, some 3rd party interference depending on how finicky the customers are.

If you can't take the risk of a changing bitcoin price and yet want to stay in the crypo world, use bitUSD.

The bootloader v1.2.0 does not ask confirmation of firmware checksum, it has some different text and it has a hidden bigger set of digits (which are too large to fit in three rows on the display).  Most of the changes to the root directory are documented in the repository.

We first need a human consensus (over what code to run) before we can achieve a machine consensus over the longest chain.\n\n> are there any core changes in the updates that would make it hard/impossible for 2 users who updated to 2 different updates to make an exchange?\n\nWell, this is complex. We mostly care about the security of the system, i.e. invalid and fraudulent transactions should not be displayed as valid.\n\n(I.e. if Alice claims that she paid to Bob and Bob's client shows transaction as valid, but it is not valid, Bob will send goods without receiving a proper payment, and will be very upset when he discovers it. This is what we want to prevent.)\n\nChanges to Bitcoin protocols are called forks, as, at least conceptually, blockchain branches in two: the old one and the new one. Ideally, the old one should not physically exist, i.e. all clients will upgrade to a new protocol and will start building a chain according to new rules.\n\nThere are two ways to upgrade Bitcoin: soft fork and hard fork.\n\nSoft forks are backward compatible in the sense that old clients see new blocks produced by new clients as valid. For a soft fork to be successful, it is enough for a majority of _miners_ to upgrade, as they will keep the new chain safe. (Note that by miners here and later I mean mining pools.)\n\nOld miners will recognize blocks produced by new miners, but new miners might not recognize blocks produced by old miners. Thus old miners will be forced to upgrade, as otherwise they might lose their revenues.\n\nIf soft fork introduces a new kind of a transaction, old clients won't be able neither recognize, nor produce them. However, it is not a problem, as a new address format.\n\nSo let's say Alice gives Bob a new address... Bob's client doesn't recognize it. Thus Bob knows he needs to update his client.\n\nIf Bob gives Alice his old-client address, her client will either recognize it as old and tell her to tell Bob to upgrade. Or it will be backwards-compatible, and thus it will send coins to the old address, and Bob's client will recognize old-format transaction.\n\nHard fork is different... In simple terms, anybody who haven't upgraded is at risk of accepting invalid payments. (Also they might not see payments sent to them, but that depends.) However, I think they'll get a warning if they manage to connect to at least one honest node.\n\nBitcoin developers prefer soft forks and avoid hard forks at all costs, as they create much higher risk for Bitcoin users. I'm not sure if there was even a single one hard fork in Bitcoin's history.\n\nA notable example of a soft fork is P2SH. It creates a new address format (starting with 3). Was done flawlessly, no users complained.\n\nHTH": 1, "Wow this totally makes sense, and it's genius. It's a very intuitive voting system.

To be precise though, the question to ask isn\'t so much "was Willy noticeably pushing the price up when it bought bitcoin?" but "how would the price have moved _without_ Willy in the same situation?".\n\nHowever minor, Willy would have shifted the market sentiment slightly in favor of buying at all times, reinforcing buying pressure and weakening selling pressure on a small scale. This mostly psychological effect would quickly become insignificant in the face of larger price movements, but could certainly help keep the price somewhat inflated at all other times.\n\nPeople also shouldn\'t assume Willy was _trying_ to affect the market price. Spreading out massive buy orders is a well-established tactic to _avoid_ affecting the price, trying to stay below the radar. Purely behaviorally speaking, Willy acted somewhat like a whale executing iceberg orders to accumulate hundreds of thousands of BTC. The problem and the reason Willy is significant is rather the distinctive signs uncovered that these were not _legitimate_ orders.\n\nAll that having been said, Willy was responsible for a sizable chunk of the market volume in the early parts of both its buying and selling runs (before it was overwhelmed); close to 20% of total MtGox BTC/USD volume in October 2013, if I remember correctly. No one would argue that you can slap an extra 20% worth of buy market orders on top of an existing market, no matter how spread out, without affecting the market price in any way.\n\nThere\'s more but I\'ll round off here. Everyone please keep an open mind when reading reports like ours or otherwise speculating about the MtGox case; quick and simple conclusions either way may feel satisfying but they\'re not too helpful if you want to get to the bottom of something.': 35, "^ this is the man who actually came up with the name Willy! \n\nThose were the days, weren't they? \n\nI'm in the TS almost every day.

Especially when a buy collects various orders already on the book, there is really not any way for you to tie those buys to a specific person (or bot).\n\nEven more so on a busy exchange.\n\nWhat am I missing for you to be able to tie those buys to Willy?": 3, 'Not during the rally. I specifically referred to *buy* volume above, and it was massive.': -2, 'US government?

Flip it around and you get "there is a very _low_ probability this could have happened _without_ affecting the price [on MtGox]", which is in line with what I write in my previous comment and even today six months later I more or less stand by that sentiment. How important is that in the grander scheme of things? Probably not as important as some people think.\n\nNote that in context:\n\n* I was not claiming Willy was solely responsible or the driving force behind either the boom or the crash, beyond suspicions that it contributed to them.\n* I was not claiming this was the only possible explanation; the very next line in the report is an alternative explanation.\n* This is part of the background section, documenting existing knowledge and sentiment _before_ our actual detailed analysis, starting pretty much where the Willy Report ended with its very strong claims of insider price manipulation, which we proceed to question and tone down.\n\nYou can\'t perfectly preserve your intentions across multiple write-ups and people looking for quick summaries I guess (the ability to express yourself precisely is insignificant next to the power of soundbites), but I can respond here for now and attempt to clarify as needed. :)': 13, 'I believe Willy was merely trying to do arbitrage with some Chinese exchange.  So he did not cause the Nov/2013 rally, merely helped "export" it from China.\n\nThe [**source of the Chinese demand**](http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Asia-Pacific/2013/1206/Why-the-Chinese-can-t-get-enough-of-Bitcoin-despite-bank-ban) is known (although hardly mentioned in the bitcoin media).  Comparison of the prices at different exchanges indicate that China was leading during the rally (and the folowing crash).  Huobi and OKCoin opened in Beijing only a few months before the rally.  China has clearly defined the price since then. And so on.\n\nWilly\'s behavior -- small spaced buys that did not change the price very much -- is precisely what one expects from arbitrage trading.  It is very hard to believe that MtGOX\'s management was unaware of Willy, or that Willy was buying with real money.\n\nI understand that all those "Willy" accounts nominally sold their bitcoins to one "master" account, for a fixed price independent of amount or the current market price.  Those dummy trades are recorrded in the database but obviously did not show in the ticker.  (Is this correct?)  I would guess that the bitcoins were withdrawn from that master account and sent to Chinese exchanges.\n\nFrom the point of view of the Chinese government, what happened in Nov/2013 was: tens of thousands of amateur Chinese traders suddenty imported a million (or more) worthless pieces of nothing, without going through customs or anything; and were about to pay half a billion dollars (or more) in CNY to the foreign sellers.  If so, the Dec/2013 PBoC decrees and bank account closures may have had the goal, among others, or closing that significant leak in China\'s  foreign trade balance, and preventing the transfer of all those CNY to foreign hands.

Account verification was a hassle that took time, and not something you'd want to do over and over again. Also, as you can read in our report and the Willy Report, these accounts were active one by one like a big relay race, for only hours or at most a few days each, with each new account kicking in after the previous one ran out of funds, sometimes mere seconds after. That's not a lot of time to even file for verification, much less get it approved, and never mind the time it then takes to do a bank transfer.\n\nIn short, it's not impossible for them to have been verified (we've certainly seen fraudsters go to great lengths to cheat their way through AML checks), but it would have have been difficult.": 2, 'Well said': 1, 'I might point to the actions taken by PBOC, the subsequent crash, and finally the fall of Gox as very good reasons the old whales and Chinese buyers have been hesitant to buy back in.\n\nStill not sure what Willy has to do with 2 of those 3 factors.': 0, 'I personally believe so based on the fervor (aka FOMO) at the time -- especially in China.': 0, "It's a new flavor of ice cream.": 4, 'lol': 1, 'I just remembered arguing with you many times regarding the validity of the Willy Report.

Many times, it would be tough to distinguish his buy if/when others made 10-19 BTC buys in the same time frame, but it became a game to spot his and say "there goes Willy...12.376865 at $903.13."\n\nWe placed bets based on how the ask side of the order book was forming. Example: current price is 903.11. We knew that Willy only bought 10-19 coins and waited an average of 7 minutes to do so. If the ask order book had just 2 BTC at 903.12, but 17 BTC at 903.13, we could predict that Willy\'s next buy would be at 903.13. The only guessing/betting part was mainly on the number of coins he would buy at that price -- which, btw, we never once got exactly correct. We almost always got the price correct, though, because Willy\'s purchase parameters were very predictable based on the ask side of the order book.\n\nRetroactively reviewing hours of trades allowed me to extrapolate estimates for his daily and weekly volume long before we had any actual data.': 1, 'Shh...\n\nLet the pressure build.\n\nThree words.\n\nNumismatic singularity event.': 1, "Basically this.\n\nEffectively, Willy 'mitigated' between 20-40% of newly minted coins.": 11, 'Nope. The simplest explanation for the variation of the balance of a bank account is that it is used as a bank account (i.e. money gets debited and credited). The less simple explanation is that funds have been stolen from it. The issue of 15 transactions vs. 1 is a separate one.

If that were the case, it would be happening over and over again.  And it\'s not.  The pump was the result of something very specific happening one time only.  Whales don\'t play only once.

In other words, the hypothesis of "the money was legit" is burdened with additional assumptions to account for these points (e.g. "AML checks must have been lazy" or "they must have had a shortcut for speedy account verification").\n\nSelecting the hypothesis with the fewer assumptions as your working theory is pretty much a textbook example of Occam\'s Razor, but I didn\'t really come here to argue semantics, nor have I "leaped to any conclusions".': 1, 'Because the change was persistent and always positive.

Maybe as /u/paleh0rse says it was never more than a few pennies per trade. I can believe that easily enough. But the analysis can\'t stop there. \n\nAs anyone who follows this market knows, during times of slow trading, the inflation effect is quite visible. Bitcoin doesn\'t trade sideways: the price sags. This produces obvious negative sentiment. \n\nIn short, Willy ate the inflationary sag. Instead of watching the price get nibbled away by inflation during periods of slow action, we watched the price creep slowly up. Instead of building bearish sentiment during times of weak demand, Willy produced false confidence -  "it keeps going up!" - that drew in the Chinese, feuling the 2013 bubble.\n\nIn my opinion.

The latter is somewhat more speculative, and as you say that's one of the open-ended notes we ended the preliminary report on last year. You'll find that both possible answers cast suspicions of wrongdoing, though.\n\nThe more general question of legitimacy is whether this much money could credibly have flowed into and through MtGox in this fashion without any wrongdoing anywhere, and I think the answer to that is 'no' for several reasons. Some of these were already touched upon in the Willy Report.\n\n* A legitimate customer would have little need to spread their funds and bitcoin purchases out across multiple accounts. No one except MtGox staff would be able to see individual account activity.\n* The log entries for Willy trades stand out uniquely in the leaked trade logs. Either there was something funny with how the accounts were set up, or the logs have been explicitly tampered with to modify entries for specifically these accounts.\n* During November 2013, something like 100 million USD was injected into Willy accounts and spent to buy bitcoin. There should be no way for this kind of money to be deposited in this kind of timeframe into a handful of accounts without anyone raising an eyebrow with AML checks in place.\n* Ever since June 2013, account verification was necessary in order to make fiat deposits at MtGox, yet here are a bunch of accounts, seemingly being created on the fly over time (as opposed to in bulk in advance), instantly able to receive large and conspicuous deposits.\n\nWhile we can debate the value of every one of these points, I think it's reasonable to apply the principle of Occam's Razor and say that this activity being fraudulent was the more plausible interpretation and worth investigating more closely.": 2, 'Push mtgox price up, while also depressing it on other exchanges.\n\nIt could be some initiating signal, but not the driving force.': 2, "> That's a very tiny fraction of the buy volume across Gox and BTCChina during the rally\n\nThat's a very tiny fraction of the ~~buy~~ volume.
