Either based on 10 variations of the hardfork blockhash, or maybe going back 10 blocks. Not sure the best way to start the 10 interleaves. And 10 is just a convenient number to use due to 10 minute average block time. The nature of interleaving is that you can interleave it however many you want, within reason. So if a way is made to adjust the number of interleaves automatically every 2016 blocks, this would allow the number of parallel chains to adapt to the recent volumes.\n\nnow we have 10 almost independent interleaves. The miners would be able to mine on all 10 interleaves at once. An ordering of the blocks is simply based on the order of the interleaves, regardless of when the block is mined.\n\nThis creates the one case of a later interleave getting a block before the current interleave is done. So it is possible that tx that is valid without considering that interleave and gets into the future block is invalidated when the current interleave is solved.\n\nHowever this is a feature not a bug!\nIt allows to create different service levels, ie 1 minute average confirmation time by the user submitting 10 tx all using the same vins. It will only get confirmed in one of the interleaves (the next one that completes) so there is no double spend, just 1 minute time, but still there is 10 minutes block time for all interleaves.\n\nSo users that want 1 minute confirmations would pay 10x the txfee, which will make miners happy, but if you are in a hurry, then it is well worth it.\n\nOnce the interleave genesis hash is determined, then implementing this in the core is pretty straight forward.': 3, 'so zkpct is based on p2sh... you could attempt to run parallel blockchains in a zkp rulespace... just a wild idea...

Have a think about at which price point Bitcoin is no longer useful to _*you*_. For me, it's probably somewhere near a dollar.

It should be much higher now per transaction, given that we have many more transactions now, unless people truly value their BTC transactions that much less compared to back then, or we\'ve got a lot more free riders that don\'t value the service that the miners provide to them. Not mutually exclusive, of course, and there may be other reasons.\n\n> Also, you need to remember that fees measured in USD need to consider the Bitcoin price... and it\'s hardly fair to compare $1000 coin fees with $450 coin fees.\n\nNo, I still think it\'s fair. On a per transaction basis, there\'s not necessarily a reason to suspect that just because the value of an *overall* bitcoin was worth more, that the random fractions of BTC that people were moving around then were somehow valued more by them. If anything, you\'d think they\'d have more of a reason to not pay a transaction fee back then, if there was a good chance that it would still be included.\n\nSure, maybe there\'s some sort of irrational exuberance at play here, but when someone is transacting $5 worth of bitcoins today, I don\'t think they are thinking, "Man, as a percentage of the $5 worth of bitcoins that I\'m sending, I\'m now less willing to pay a certain dollar-valued transaction fee than I did in 2013."\n\nWe\'d probably have to look at the median transaction fee paid back then, in USD terms, compared to that being paid today to explore this in more depth.': 1, "> RBF, SegWit\n\nRBF has been in development for quite some time.

Segwit will make use of the available 1MB more efficient by moving the witness data out of the transaction and into a secondary buffer, bringing the total of the two to a max of 4MB. Since it's a soft fork, the rollout is much faster than a hard fork and will therefore bring extra capacity much faster.

The International Monetary Fund extolled the potential benefits of virtual currencies and said they warrant a more nuanced regulatory approach, at a time when the future of bitcoin, the most well-known example, is in doubt's. Bitcoin traded at about $379 on Jan. 20, about a third of its peak in 2013. Photographer: Chris Ratcliffe/Bloomberg\xc2\xa9Bloomberg\nB\nitcoin, the decentralised, mainly digital currency that is neither issued nor guaranteed by central banks, has always seemed like a magic trick. Rather than spinning straw into gold it transforms wasted computing power into money that people will actually accept as payment.\nRadical libertarians have desperately wanted to believe in it because they hope it can resolve the following dilemma. They prefer markets to politics and they violently distrust states. But modern states in effect have a monopoly over the currencies that markets need in order to work.\nMore\nON THIS TOPIC\nInside Business Digital world faces two key tests\nBitcoin threatened by software schism\nMasters\xe2\x80\x99 blockchain start-up raises $50m\nUse bitcoin technology for NHS, expert says\nIN OPINION\nLaw and Justice rewrites Polish history\nIn praise of power stations\nMeghan O\xe2\x80\x99Sullivan Saudi oil policy\nRobert Manning China, US and North Korea\nBitcoin, if it became broadly accepted, would challenge states\xe2\x80\x99 dominance of the economy. It is designed to prevent monopoly by states or other entities, building a new currency based on shared information and making it hard for any entity to gain control. Politics disappears and a combination of technology and cryptographic proofs is conjured up in its place.\nUnfortunately, the magic is wearing off. Some of the technological innovations associated with bitcoin will stick around. The political project will not. Rather than overcoming conventional politics, bitcoin is succumbing to it.\nThe biggest fights are focused on the most innovative element of bitcoin: the \xe2\x80\x9cblockchain\xe2\x80\x9d. This is a decentralised ledger of transactions using bitcoin. Bitcoin \xe2\x80\x9cminers\xe2\x80\x9d compete with one another to solve computationally hard problems. The winner receives new bitcoin but also validates a \xe2\x80\x9cblock\xe2\x80\x9d of queued transactions, which is then added to the ledger and shared with the community.\nThis system was designed to replace third-party regulation with decentralised authority. For technical reasons, it is starting to fail. Each block is small, meaning the system can handle only a few transactions at a time. As more people have started to use bitcoin, the system has grown more unreliable.\nThe problem is that coming up with a fix requires political agreement. Because there is no centralised authority within bitcoin, there is no one who can impose a mandate. Bitcoin\xe2\x80\x99s creator, the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto, apparently vanished years ago, leaving big decisions to an increasingly quarrelsome community.\nSome influential members of the bitcoin network want to change the currency\xe2\x80\x99s protocols to make the blocks bigger so that more bitcoin are released at one time, speeding up transactions. Others have responded with outrage, claiming that this would destroy bitcoin. A fundamental change to the protocol would \xe2\x80\x9cfork the chain\xe2\x80\x9d, potentially creating two different currencies with irreconcilable records, one for those who embraced the fix and another for those who refused it.\nOthers want instead to move crucial parts of transaction handling away from the block chain, relying more on \xe2\x80\x9cside chains\xe2\x80\x9d. Again, this idea is disputed: side chains could turn bitcoin\xe2\x80\x99s unified approach into a stew of quasi-compatible proprietary solutions.\nThe leading proposal to fork the chain would require 75 per cent of the bitcoin network to agree to the proposal before it was fully implemented. However, no one is empowered to stop people from swaying opinion in illegitimate ways. Companies that favour changing the protocol, such as Coinbase, a bitcoin \xe2\x80\x9cwallet\xe2\x80\x9d and exchange business, have been targeted by distributed denial of service attacks intended to knock their servers off the internet. People on both sides have withdrawn from the bitcoin network after receiving threats.\nTechnology: Blockchain key\n \nFinancial groups race to harness the power of the bitcoin infrastructure to slash costs\nThis free-for-all demonstrates the main problem of technological libertarianism. It does not escape politics but temporarily displaces and conceals it. As bitcoin has become more successful, it has also become potentially more lucrative. Ideology is giving way to fights over who gets what. And it turns out that libertarians are not very good at figuring out how to resolve these political clashes.\nAs these fights become more publicly visible, they will hurt bitcoin outside its core base of enthusiasts. The advocates of bitcoin got one thing absolutely right. Money is a confidence trick, a form of \xe2\x80\x9cfrozen desire\xe2\x80\x9d, as the writer James Buchan describes it. We only believe in it because everyone else believes in it. So if bitcoin believers believed hard enough, and convinced other people to believe, they had a shot at making it generally accepted.\nThat is now going to be far harder. The apparent value of bitcoin depends on a suspension of disbelief. It is hard to see how the illusion can work when the magicians are punching each other out on stage.\nThe writer is associate professor of political science and international affairs at George Washington University": 1, 'was free for me. geoblocking ?': 1}, ('NEW BITCOIN WORLD ELITE?', 0): {'Wanna bet?\n\nRemindMe! 5 years : Quantum computers actually made bitcoin better.': 1, 'Any coins today stored locally, for example, would be considered extremely un-secure.

Definitely agree.  Where people fuck up in their logic is not being able to see beyond their own perspective.  \n\nDeflation is the opposite, and from the saver/consumer side it is (in the short term good), I am rewarded for saving by getting growing purchasing power.  The problem is that it completely ignores the supply side.  Deflation is savers "stealing" from borrowers.  Who are borrowers?  In general they are people who are investing and expanding the economy, so a deflationary environment discourages them from investing in the future, because their expected profitability drops because prices are falling.  If they dont expand then there will be less jobs, lower wages, and less incentive to take risk and innovate, hence a deflationary spiral, just like how we can have an inflationary spiral on the opposite extreme.\n\nIn the end inflation/deflation are just two sides of a coin, inflation transfers value from savers to borrowers, deflation transfers value from borrowers to savers.

But what has been built is "miners put Bitcoin transactions in order" and then we\'re trying to engineer everything else on top of that.\n\nInstead there should be a generic "putting things in order" layer upon which bitcoin and everything else is built.\n\nI know, without bitcoin from the start, how could we compensate miners? Well, bitcoin could have been just the first application on top of that layer. But there was never any such layer, it was all bound together, and it still is.\n\nMiners should just be paid to apply proof of work to a merkle tree root - choose a miner however you want, pay them however you want. In the specific instance of bitcoin, miners listen to the bitcoin network for offers and they\'re paid by that network when they find a block with sufficient difficulty. But that shouldn\'t be the only way to pay miners. You should be able to pay them to apply PoW to **anything**, and pay with cash or credit cards or a micropayment channel or whatever the miner accepts.\n\nAs Paul says, there\'s no cost to include any extra content in whatever is being mined.': 2, "While nice in theory, there is a problem with such claims: in short, the Bitcoin miners don't just stamp history, they also verify it. They literally attack incorrect versions of history (double spendings, wrong signatures, generating coins out of nowhere). But those miners which don't merge-mine don't care about rules in other chains and that means they don't add any security. On the contrary, if less than 50% Bitcoin miners are convinced to merge-mine some other coin, that other coin is even less secure because it uses same algorithm so it's cheap for those miners to attack it (they already have the hardware). Though I must admit merge mining may be way to attract current miners.\n\nSaying that any feature can be simply added to Bitcoin is true in theory but very ridiculous in practice - just look at block size problem.\n\nExplanation why merge mining doesn't work against double spending attack in weaker chain:\n\nLet's say there is merge-mining altcoin with it's own rules (e.g. Ethereum rules). This altcoin has less than 50% of Bitcoin, let's say 40% and there is attacker which has 60% of that hash power - which equals to 24% of Bitcoin hash power. Now, the attacker can't attack the Bitcoin, but he can still double-spend on alt coin and the fact that it's merge-mined won't prevent him doing so.\n\nIf he mines new block which would be considered as invalid by alt coin but it's valid Bitcoin block (those 60 % non-merge-miners see just hash in coinbase and don't care what it means) it will be happily accepted by Bitcoin network and mined upon. While full validating nodes can filter invalid blocks out, they still face one decision: if the miner mines two blocks which conflict by alt coin rules but are both valid by Bitcoin rules how do they decide which of them is valid by their rules?\n\nThey know which of them was mined sooner, so they may accept just first of them, the last or ignore that information. \n\nNow, accepting last one is obviously wrong.\n\nAccepting the first seems OK at first, but then attacker could pre-mine block containing transaction to himself, keep it secret and publish just hash of alt coin block. Bitcoin network would accept that but alt coin network would be unable to validate it so it would have to reject it and continue mining on some other block. Now attacker could spend his alt coins, receive something for it and later reveal his block, which would immediately overwrite his transaction with previous one.\n\nFinally the alt coin network can ignore ordering in Bitcoin and just calculate PoW. This effectively makes merge-mining useless in terms of security, because the Bitcoin PoW isn't actually used.": 2, 'Upvoted.

Now you could argue from an engineering standpoint that Litecoin is really just an aberration, and over 100 year time frame may not exist.  \n\nBut we can only go on recent history. The world is full of variety even when evidence and science and even economics point to better systems.\n\nSo even if you concede that Ethereum is Vaporware (clearly its not),  people will still spend money on vaporware.\n\nHowever if you take a step back.\n\nEthereum and other altcoins are already anchored to Bitcoin.\n\nEthereum will never exist without Bitcoin, because it is the stability of Bitcoin Network that underpins the ability to fund and transact in the crypto economies that exist on top.\n\nIf tomorrow the world wanted to fund Ethereum, they will in most cases buy Bitcoin to get to Ethereum.

And what the Cyber world needs more than anything is a stable immutable bitcoin to underpin everything, because if Ethereum fails or breaks the value embedded in the system would flow back to Bitcoin.\n\nBut if Bitcoin failed a much more simpler system, the value of all crypto would collapse.

If the attacker tries to "gain" 51% of Voldacoin over time, they send a signal that Voldacoin mining must become more competitive and if they don\'t achieve 51% they are now more invested in keeping Voldacoin alive than killing it. \n\n**Now let\'s assume that someone does want Voldacoin dead, can benefit from it and does try. If I were Voldacoin (or a listener to /u/vbuterin radio) I would simply transmit the last block header of Voldacoin on "FM" and then transmit the block header it appeared on from "FM" on Voldacoin. That would ensure that I have a recent proof of what constitutes the true state of Voldacoin.
