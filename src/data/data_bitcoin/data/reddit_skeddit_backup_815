How about airbitz? Convince me, please, cause blockchain really **** on iPhone.': 3, "Actually wrote a little review covering some of the wallets I use on bitcointalk, anyhow I just copied and pasted my experience with mobile wallets that I have been using (breadwallet actually messaged me but I haven't played around with that yet and will review them soon). While Mycelium holds the reputation of being the best wallet and most reliable, but Airbitz is getting up there. You can actually do stuff and browse pictures of businesses when you're bored:\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nI recommend both the Airbitz and Mycelium wallets if you are new. Airbitz has a built in directory, looks beautiful, and has an easy interface for new people. Mycelium on the other hand is very reliable. I've been using Mycelium since early last year and they just recently upgraded to HD 2.0 wallet with additional features. Mycelium also lets you connect with people to buy and sell bitcoins locally with peer reviews. \n\nThen you have the Blockchain wallet which is alright but still somewhat confusing and buggy especially after the new upgrade and look. The directory is not as complete and doesn't have pictures either but gets the job done. I primarily use Blockchain Wallet just to keep track of all my addresses with their watch address list. They are one of the oldest wallets that have been around but other wallets are starting to get ahead of them in other areas.\n\nOther than those 3 mentioned above, I also use Coinbase, Hive, and the original bitcoin wallet for pocket change. Coinbase is a given, I need an app to transfer to and from my other wallets after I buy my bitcoins. Hive is alright as well but I see them being too similar to Mycelium and end up using Mycelium more often. The original bitcoin wallet I use every now and then just to test sends or leave pocket change on. I probably have under 20 transactions with the original bitcoin wallet so really not much to say for that one.\n\nI find myself using Mycelium the most but increasingly on Airbitz just because it looks appealing to the eye. I also believe they are the only one, or are one of a few wallets that support BLE transfer so you don't need to scan QR Codes or paste long addresses.\n\nLastly, the Airbitz and Mycelium videos sold me:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Z7-ya-h5Y - airbitz\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byp_x2be8C8 - mycelium\n\nIf anyone else has a wallet that I missed please feel free to shoot me some recommendations so I can download it myself especially if you think they are better than Airbitz or Mycelium since those are my hot ones right now.": 2, "Aaron.

I liken it to the gold rushes of old. First people are picking up nuggets off the ground, then panning, then the shovel sellers come and then the first wave or hopefuls arrive, then the bickering, thefts, big windfalls, etc. Then after the shovel sellers, come the general stores, taverns, and more seedier enterprises. \n\nOne could also liken it to the Cambrian explosion, all manner of dumb, smart, insane, conservative, and careful experiments were all seen as viable back then. People were very loose and fast to trust when they spent their bitcoins and many had less brains than sense. A lot were still fixated on investing their bitcoin in order to acquire more like we do with traditional money but most that did were suckered by scams, the rising price (ironically holding would have made ten times more than investing/trading back then, and miners also fell victim to this too) or were simply relieved of them because they were completely naive about security. Mining from CPU to GPU to FPGA to ASIC was an extraordinary transformation and was innovation in it's purest form, and is one of the things that I will remember the most. There was huge transformation in mining and underpins much of the first few years.\n\nBig names in Bitcoin right now were simply well known faces in the crowd back then, some that were trusted back then are now infamous/pariahs, and others that played a huge hand in the early days and were well known are now hardly ever mentioned. Bitcoin has taught me a huge amount about communities and about the nature of money, so I'm immensely glad I got to share in the early days.\n\nI'm also very glad we've moved past those days, it was extremely volatile, and fraught with hackers/scammers/trolls, and those that had bitcoins back then, unless they were die hard holders that were super careful about securing their coins, usually lost them pretty quickly (or were just lucky to have slipped through the net of hackers preying on people's wallets). Those were interesting times.": 1, 'I remember thinking in the late 90\'s that the "internet wave" had reached critical mass. Home computers were starting to go well below $2000. People weren\'t buying them to go online but as "educational tools" given the vast libraries of multimedia CD-ROM content like encyclopedias often thrown in for free. \n\nIt was expensive to go online and the internet wasn\'t that big. But yet AOL was enormous and was growing exponentially. It *had* to slow down. It didn\'t. It kept growing. To this day I still don\'t understand why they went to an unlimited service model so early. They didn\'t have to. They could have been like other telecoms and soaked people for a bit longer (It was $3 an hour and that $3 was worth a lot more back then.) But they wanted to own the market and they did. \n\nThe dot.com crash is what most people think of when they think of that era. What they forget is the other success stories. Amazon for example was a complete joke in the financial press. They literally bled cash for years. Then there\'s facebook and twitter but these are all at a disadvantage because they are centralized. \n\nThe point is that bitcoin is post conception but pre adoption. I don\'t think we\'ve seen anything yet. If bitcoin has any indication of dying I\'ve not seen it. Where\'s the evidence? Where\'s the revolutionary crypto eating it\'s lunch?

No doubt persons with more tech-/econo- background will pick up on the trends and meanings behind Bitcoins movements more so than the average consumer/investor.\n\nThe best way I think anyone can become involved with Bitcoin is to simply use it whenever you can, whenever its advantages outweigh the disadvantages in a particular scenario, and to network with others using it so that the disadvantages can be made clear and a solution can be worked towards. I don't need to say this since it is what has been going on since 2009, but I think it's important to remember that Bitcoin and its community is as strong as its tech, and the tech is maintained in one way or another by the same community.\n\nI'm sure that in 2009 very few people actually could predict anything like what has happened since.

A bug bounty was suggested too but that, again, requires some capital.  \n\nThe code is all on [github](https://github.com/inuitwallet/bippy) and Bippy has been in use for a while with no complaints although not through the Windows installer.  \n\nThe base of Bippy is [inuit](http://inuit-wallet.co.uk), my command line, multi-currency cold storage offering. That in turn borrows quite heavily from a script by [deepceleron](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=361092.0) and [pybitcointools](https://github.com/vbuterin/pybitcointools). (For a full list have a look at the 'Thanks' page on the inuit wallet website).  \n\nTo bundle it I used PyInstaller so the original python code is viewable in the Bippy directory in Program Files after installation. The installer itself is written in AutoHotkey. If you open the installer.exe file with notepad and scroll to the bottom, you will see the code for it so you can check what it's actually doing on your PC (just copying files to the Program Files directory and setting up a Start Menu folder. It doesn't touch the registry). \n\nIt would be really great if someone would take a look through the code as it is very hard to gain trust in the Bitcoin (and other cryptos) community. I hope that by being open and contactable and providing what I can to the community, I can earn some of that trust.
