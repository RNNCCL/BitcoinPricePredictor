These guys used a hash of a digital work and timestamped it on the blockchain (the first decentralized publicly verifiable ledger).\n\nAlthough timestamping is part of the process, there are still certainly more parts of the process that warrant giving the entire process its own name.  Also, the purpose behind the process is unique from and narrower than purposes behind mere timestamping.  The purpose is to prove the existence of an electronic document at a specific time in history.  Timestamping has never served this purpose, because there has never been a blockchain--which can\'t be changed by a single entity.   Thus "proof of existence" is a proper and suitable name.\n\nDon\'t be a curmudgeon.

It is now almost trivial for virtually anyone to produce a file that will have the same MD5 hash as a given original, with a great deal of additional data (such as a backdoor in software). This was the primary infection vector for the U.S. Government\'s "Flame" malware (see https://www.trailofbits.com/resources/flame-md5.pdf ).\n\nThe only acceptable verification for a software download, most especially a download of a complete GNU/Linux system, is an OpenPGP signature based on a strong hash, preferably SHA-2 or better. One excellent example of this is [Gentoo Linux](https://www.gentoo.org/)\'s verification for their downloads, an example of which is here: http://distfiles.gentoo.org/releases/amd64/autobuilds/current-install-amd64-minimal/install-amd64-minimal-20141204.iso.DIGESTS.asc - they provide two separate, very different and very strong cryptographic hashes for the relevant files (SHA-512 and Whirlpool) which are then cryptographically signed with GPG using their private key. This allows very secure validation of any received files, to ensure that they were not tampered with in transit or on the server. Unfortunately, their GPG configuration is set up to use only SHA-1 as their GPG digest algorithm, but SHA-1 is still at least much less broken than MD5.\n\nGPG signatures are very important, because verifying a download against a hash published on a website is almost useless, except to ensure that the download wasn\'t accidentally corrupted in transit. That\'s because if any adversary is able to alter the file you download to contain malware, then they are almost certainly also able to alter the web page you visit that tells you its hash. A GPG signature, on the other hand, cannot be forged, and therefore it isn\'t necessary to trust the provider of the file itself to provide a trusted hash. However, [ensuring that you have the correct OpenPGP Public Key](http://www.rubin.ch/pgp/weboftrust.en.html) to verify the download is still an important consideration.\n\nFor more information about MD5\'s weaknesses, check out these links:\n\nhttp://www.mathstat.dal.ca/~selinger/md5collision/  \nhttp://www.win.tue.nl/hashclash/ChosenPrefixCollisions/': 1, 'It\'s a matter of closing the time range: removing the "any time" before and after is already a nice thing.\n\nAnd sure, it cannot be applied to anything (like the hostage video scenario you propose); but it\'s valid for a lot of other things.\nThen it\'s your problem, meaning that it\'s you that should publish & proof as soon as it\'s finished/ready, if you care about that kind of things.\n': 1, "How to proof that the letter did not already exist earlier, and that the blockchain hash wasn't inserted much later?\n\nIt is **impossible** to proof that any information (letter, picture, video, ...) did not exist prior to a specific point in time.

The 148 bytes is an estimate based on the size of a P2PKH input, so it\'s possible to create outputs (such as P2SH) that are more "dusty" than the dust limit. ': 4, 'Ah, right - that makes sense.\n\nTo recap:\n\nA transaction will only be relayed by 0.10 nodes running default settings if the value of each output is **greater than 546 satoshis** ("dust limit"). If this threshold is not met, the entire transaction will be rejected as non-standard. Nodes set their own relay policies, and so may adjust this limit up or down as they please.\n\nThe dust limit is modeled on a hypothetical transaction with one input and one output, and which unlocks its unspent output with a pay-to-public-key-hash (P2PKH) response script. The dust limit is 3 times the relay fee for this transaction.\n\nTo derive the dust limit, we must calculate the relay fee for the transaction. A rate of 1 satoshi/byte applies. The length, in bytes, of the transaction is calculated as:\n\ntransaction length = 148 + output length\n\n(This calculation ignores a 10 byte overhead and +/- one byte uncertainty resulting from the exact format of the input signature.)\n\nOutputs require 34 bytes if using a P2PKH challenge script. Plugging this value into the above equation gives a transaction length of 182 bytes (148 + 34). If a different kind of output challenge script is used (e.g., P2SH or multisig), its length should replace the value 34.\n\nThe relay fee rate for 0.10 nodes running default settings is 1 satoshi/byte. Therefore the relay fee for this hypothetical transaction is 182 satoshis.\n\nFinally, the dust limit is 3 times the relay fee (3x182), or 546 satoshis.': 1, "No, it only calculates the serialized size of the **output**.  Specifically:\n\n* 8-byte amount (int64_t)\n* 1 or 3-byte compactSize uint byte count for the pubkey script (1 byte for scripts up to 252 bytes; 3 bytes for scripts up to 10,000 bytes, the max size of a single script)\n* the number of bytes in the pubkey script\n\nFor a P2PKH output, that's 8 bytes amount, 1 byte count, 1 byte OP_DUP, 1 byte OP_HASH160, 1 byte OP_PUSH20, 20 bytes hash, 1 byte OP_EQUALVERIFY, and 1 byte OP_CHECKSIG == 34 bytes.\n\nBecause that only calculates the size of the output, we also add the size of a typical input to capture most of the costs.  It's true that there's an un-captured cost from the transaction overhead, but that can be minor in a transaction with multiple inputs.  (And the dust limit is an arbitrary limit meant to discourage spam, so it's acceptable to be imprecise as long as the goal is met and no serious burdens are placed on legitimate transactions.)": 2, '>Second, your first link has the formula used to calculate the byte size:\n>    size_t nSize = GetSerializeSize(SER_DISK,0)+148u;\n\nThanks, I think this was the source of my confusion.\n\nFollowing GetSerializeSize through to serialize.h, it looks like that function calculates the length, in bytes, of the transaction as if it were written to disk.\n\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/v0.10.0rc3/src/serialize.h#L97\n\nIf so, why add 148 to the result of GetSerializeSize (the likely length of a P2PKH input)? \n\nIt seems that GetSerializeSize should return the actual transaction length, in bytes, including inputs.

I have a Stratfor membership and this is first bitcoin/cryptocurrency post from them that I have seen. They are on top of all the leading global socioeconomic & miltary trends, and many powerful decision makers rely on Stratfor to inform their decisions. ': 2, 'On Jan. 26, a New York Stock Exchange-backed startup, Coinbase, launched the United States\' first regulated bitcoin exchange. The new exchange lends credibility to the cryptocurrency, which has lost about 60 percent of its value since the beginning of last June amid fraud, hacking and theft cases that plagued the currency\'s stability.\n\nThe exchange\'s launch is noteworthy, but so is the distinction between bitcoin\'s value and its regulatory and business acceptance. Though bitcoin might fail should its users lose faith in it, the concept of cryptocurrencies is here to stay. The endorsement of these digital currencies by financial regulators and merchants is a move toward the broader recognition and legitimacy of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, once favored by those who wanted a currency unregulated by any government. \n\nCryptocurrencies can be thought of as a technology with the power to have far-reaching effects on the global economy. In some ways the individual bitcoin is similar to gold in that it is hard-wired to appreciate in value. However, unlike gold or any other currency, it can be divided almost endlessly into small parts. Bitcoin was among the first cryptocurrencies to gain serious interest and backing, largely due to the efforts of Satoshi Nakamoto, a pseudonym for the person or group responsible for the "bitcoin protocol." Prior to bitcoin, electronic currencies required a third party, such as PayPal, to determine if one party still owned the money or had previously spent it, thus transferring ownership to someone else. The bitcoin protocol solved this problem by creating a publicly viewable global ledger, known as the "blockchain," that shows the sequential transactions of all accounts using the cryptocurrency.\n\nBitcoins are bought and sold online and are generally stored in a digital wallet. The currency is not controlled by a central bank but is instead managed by an online community. Members with powerful computers are encouraged to maintain the transactional register by "verifying the blockchain" \xe2\x80\x94 solving complex mathematical equations and adding another block of transactions to the existing chain. This process is known as mining, because the verifier is rewarded with new bitcoins. New bitcoins will not be created after there are 21 million in circulation, which is projected to happen in 2140.\n\nCryptocurrencies are still far from becoming a powerful financial tool. Yet, cryptocurrencies and the overarching bitcoin protocol will remain in some shape and fashion. The movement on the regulatory front is an important precedent that is being set for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. It remains to be seen if these currencies can grow out of their niche market, but much like the Internet or file sharing, governments cannot exercise complete control. The United States and United Kingdom appear to recognize this fact and are trying to do as much as possible to bring bitcoin and other similar currencies into the traditional financial market.': 5}, ('Former U.S. Mint Director has joined Coin.co', 73): {'Interesting, the CEO of Coin.co is the former CEO of CoinValidation.

So why the subterfuge? Moreover, if Cody wants to know what Gavin thinks about how the Foundation is being run then **just fucking ask him!** You\'re not dealing with the KGB here, Gavin is not shy about expressing his opinions on things and having Cody supposedly fishing Gavin\'s brain for the truth is so incredibly childish and disrespectful it just shows how backward Cody is.': 1, 'Gavin Andresen is an idiot.': -13, 'Reason 497 that Cody Wilson is just an attention whore with no morals.

Bitcoin can significantly help tilt things in the other direction, and many smart people believe in supporting that. However, not all are in agreement on what all is possible, nor the best way to proceed forward. Decentralization is generally agreed to be a good thing, but exactly how everything should look, while still being workable, is less clear (e.g. see debate on working with/without regulators).\n\nOne of the first tests of competing thinking came with the advent of Bitcoin Foundation, an organization proposed by Gavin Andresen, to formalize many administrative functions for supporting Bitcoin, like protecting its trademark from profiteers, as well as providing a platform to better fund development. Even I joined in vocal opposition to the proposed formation, fearing too much centralized influence. I backed down upon realizing the community had a viable outlet from abuse and dissatisfaction in the form of alt-coins. So long as Bitcoin wasn\'t the only thing which could be fought over, the threat of a foundation, I felt, was diminished.\n\nThere are individuals in the community, though, whom I\'d say are more idealistic in decentralized mandate. I\'d put Amir Taaki, co-creator of [Darkwallet](http://www.coindesk.com/hyper-anonymising-bitcoin-service-dark-wallet-launches-today/), in that camp. Amir teamed up with Cody Wilson who gained fame for creating a [3d printable gun](http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/feb/10/cody-wilson-3d-gun-anarchist).\n\nWhile Gavin\'s large contribution to Bitcoin is known community-wide, he has had to deal with a remnant of opposition to the foundation which allows him the predictability of a salary for his previously free work. Cody Wilson voiced a proposal of candidacy with intent to disband the foundation. In a Coindesk article on this Gavin commented about SMTP (email) not having a foundation, but being "defined by a bunch of IETF RFC\'s" and that he envisioned Bitcoin Foundation being more like that (paraphrasing), an institution focused more on engineering and technical documents.\n\nCody Wilson then finds that the IETF\'s operating policy includes, among other things, no formal membership and no legal franchise.

Vint Cerf, Bob Kahn, Lyman Chapin released a document, Announcing ISoc, which explained the rationale for establishing the Internet Society. This document also defines the original charter of the organization as follows:\n>\n>The Society will be a non-profit organization and will be operated for international educational, charitable, and scientific purposes, among which are:\n>\n>* To facilitate and support the technical evolution of the Internet as a research and education infrastructure and to stimulate involvement of the academic, scientific, and engineering communities (among others) in the evolution of the Internet.\n>* To educate the academic and scientific communities and the public concerning the technology, use, and application of the Internet.\n>* To promote scientific and educational applications of Internet technology for the benefit of educational institutions at all grade levels, industry, and the public at large.\n>* To provide a forum for exploration of new Internet applications and to foster collaboration among organizations in their operation and use of the Internet.[4]\n\n>**Many of the main forces of the Internet, such as the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), remain very informal organizations from a legal perspective. There was a growing need for financial support and organization structure.**\n\nSo, while Cody Wilson is *technically correct*, that is, unfortunately, *not* the best kind of correct.
