Limit the transaction size. $1000 to $5000 is the range that these car scammers are looking for. If you sell your bitcoin in <$500 amounts or less, it becomes much less worth the scammer\'s time because it\'s difficult and time-consuming to find and dupe their victims. It also makes potential losses more palatable. \n\n2. Don\'t just have them write "for bitcoins." Make them write: 1) to [your username] on localbitcoins.com, 2) from [their username] on localbitcoins.com, 3) For buying bitcoins, 4) the reference number. Add anything else you can think of. The point is to make them write so many details about the transaction on the receipt so that the car-buying victim has to have a 75 IQ to not get suspicious and refuse to deposit or cooperate.\n\n3. Check their IP address and see if they are in the state and country where the deposit was made. Lots of foreign scammers are too lazy or dumb to even get behind a proxy so this screens them out. Refuse deals with anyone using TOR.\n\n4. Refuse deals with anyone who doesn\'t have at least 10 different transactions with decent volume and a few different users. After a scammer pulls off a scam, their account becomes useless and they have to start news ones. You\'ll screen out innocent newbies along with the bad guys and it may take longer to sell, but that\'s not your problem. Other sellers who want to charge more or work with newbies will sell to them. Their bank accounts will get closed a lot sooner than yours and they\'ll have to fight fraud a lot more often than you.\n\n5. If you\'ve done all that, but for some reason you still feel suspicious (maybe because of weird delays or some other reason), you can just tell the buyer that you need more verification such as a picture of them holding their ID or a text message. Or you can tell them that you want to hold the bitcoins for a certain amount of time. See if the verification matches and then hold the coins and see if anyone complains to your bank or something about a car deal within the next few days.\n\nOr, you can do what I did:\nUse www.BitQuick.co to sell coins. They have years of experience filtering out scammers and will guarantee your money anyway so it\'s not your problem. It\'s really a no-brainer. Selling on LBC is not fun. Even the best, most careful sellers have to deal with fraud and getting bank accounts closed. BitQuick will make it much easier.': 6, 'I have not watched the video, but from what I understand, both the buyer and the seller entered into a verbal contract with a middle man.  The seller honered his part of the contract in good faith.  The buyer did not have the whole of his contract honored.

The reason I believe the defendant is that I just don't believe that anyone sophisticated enough to use bitcoin would expose their bank info in this way. It's obvious that the real scammer just used the defendant to perpetrate this crime. We need to get better judges that understand these crimes. Actually, the best option is to use multisig for these types of transactions via something like open bazaar and to have a neutral arbitrator/escrow (that cares about their reputation) to hold the funds in a 2 of 3 multisig until the transfer takes place.

Also, it is one of the "Legit" advantages Bitcoin has (not related to shady stuff), so once they have neutralized that advantage, it will be easier to ban/block bitcoin because at that point they can say that all bitcoin has going for it is the shady stuff.\n\nThat\'s how I see their reasoning, and I guess it has some merit, but I don\'t personally think that is how it will play out. I do believe Bitcoin will "win" in the end because what the banks fail to take into equation, is that innovation and speed of evolution within the "free" space is going to be so much faster. And therefore, while the banks implement their grand masterplan over the next 10 years, the world economy will have changed so drastically their (the banks) win will be the little one, while the free unregulated world will have already conquered the new markets (IoT-transactions, drone- and 3D-printing services, stuff like that). \n\nThis is analogous with when the Internet revolution swept in.
