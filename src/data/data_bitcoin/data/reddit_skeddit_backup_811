Their motivations for opensourcing the code, and schematics is, I\'m guessing, mostly driven by the fact that they want to spur confidence in the design/implementation so that it ratifies their claims it does exactly what they say, and is not a sloppy job. They\'re not in the business of handing to other copycats a free lunch. The bootloader code it not intrinsic to the functionality, has very little bearing on the safety/security of the device and I\'m sure that all the code they\'ve released to date can be compiled and checked functionality-wise. Additionally on the price front, they need to at least recoup costs for design, manufacture, infrastructure, organisation, construction, and maintenance, this is not simply a piece of software, it is a product consisting of hardware, software, and internet functionality which will require ongoing support/maintenance.\n\nSo while they want to make an excellent product that backs up their claims, they are not in the business of making it effortless for someone to take all that effort and produce a knockoff just so you can enjoy a sub-$60 device. As someone that has seen hundreds of "I\'ve been hacked and all my coins are gone! :(" posts  over the years I can honestly say this kind of device is vital if Bitcoin is to grow into the future and unless there is at least a financial incentive to at least break even, no-one will do it.

Nine times out of ten, these kinds of things are vaporware and even of those that do make it to a final product, they\'re usually terrible quality and don\'t meet people\'s even basic expectations, so quibbling over a bootloader not being opensource is like quibbling over GNU/Linux not being "fully" opensource because they haven\'t written their very own BIOS from scratch (and released that as open source) too.

That\'s the whole point of the debate over the bootloader blobs.\n\nIt\'s not intrinsic, because you can switch out a boot loader for your own if you wanted with your own chip (since the chip\'s write functionality is burned out to prevent overwriting the bootloader later), if it were intrinsic, it would mean that you could never run that code without the blob, it\'s not like a playstation where you switch out the BIOS and then can\'t boot the machine/run games or what have you. There\'s no DRM in the blob locking down the open sourced parts. As far as it\'s bearing on it\'s security is concerned, there is a case to be made there, but it\'s attack surface is tiny and plays no purpose once control is handed to the software that actually is open source, so it\'s bearing is secondary at best.\n\n> At least Electrum is fully open-source afaik\n\nBut is the compiler? How about the chips the software is run on? Have you demanded the chip manufacturers open source their chip designs? What about the BIOS? At the end of the day open source is no guarantee. I can very easily broaden the definition of "fully open source" to selectively exclude all manner of software/hardware the way you use it. If you don\'t trust something, you should have a valid reason as to WHY it\'s not trustable, open source does not guarantee it\'s bug free, malware-free or stable etc. If bootloaders on this chip have a history of leaking data then I\'d say you have a valid reason to rail at Satoshilabs keeping the source closed, but if your best reason is "it\'s not fully open sourced" then your suspicions/paranoia is groundless.

In your case, you\'ll just have to stay hard core for a little longer until someone decides to reverse engineer the bootloader for the sake of humanity, or until satoshi labs finds there is a stronger need to release the bootloader source over keeping it closed (like breaking even on their costs).\n\n\n\n': 1, "Trusted Execution Environments are not really a silver bullet - both for technical reasons (implementations typically fail to consider enough security issues) and commercial reasons ([the technology to implement bitcoin applications in a SIM card](https://github.com/btchip/btchipJC) has been there for many years - but you can't use it because owners won't let you)": 4, '[deleted]': -1, "Uh, I haven't looked at their website closely enough, but that is nothing at all what they claim they are working on.

That means you can build a game or an app from one codebase and run it on your windows PC, your windows phone, your windows laptop, your iMac, your Macbook, your iPhone or iPad, your Chromebook, your android phone or tablet, your raspberry pi, your tizen phone, your firefox phone, your apple/android tv, your xbox, blackberry etc.\n\nFor a gamer, that might sound like 'meh'. For software developer, that's huge.  If you'd develop native applications for a dozen platforms, a dozen operating systems on a dozen different form factors... you just couldn't do it without literally a million dollar team. But I built some board games and was playing them against my girlfriend, her on her nexus, me on an iphone, and building that was a breeze with simple web-dev skills. To think I'd have to have mastered Java and objective C instead and interface with one another, and deal with deployment on the app stores, oh the horror.\n\nThere's lots of cons and caveats to this, absolutely. (like performance, or optimizing for specific devices using their unique hardware and software systems).\n\nBut the idea is that almost any digital consumer computer ever comes with a browser. Whether that's your PC, laptop, phone, tablet, TV or console. And if you can build a game or app in a browser instead of a website, you just reached everyone. Cross platform from a single codebase is an amazing thing. The ability to push an update to a server and be done, is awesome. And while cross-browser development can be frustrating, it's much easier than e.g. getting a user to install directx or whatever on their PC and getting a million bug reports from a billion different graphics cards.\n\nBut no, for consumers... there's literally nothing. Consumers are not familiar with HTML5 and there's zero demand for it from consumers. No consumer ever has asked for an HTML5 app. So you're not alone in seeing no point for an in-browser game.

A few of the games spazz out and zoom into a corner half the time when I fullscreen them. Most of the games use Escape to open their menu, which also triggers fullscreen mode to be exited (seriously wtf who tested this. This isn't like a weird edge case ffs.

Their dev community has done a lot of great work, especially in their approach to some difficult technical challenges that decentralized networks face. We also think their policies on anonymity and distribution are admirable. The fact that so many people know about Diaspora is a testament to their success. The Diaspora Foundation have themselves described a desire to collaborate with other decentralized networks on a standard protocol and we think Synereo can contribute to that discussion.\n\nThat said, there are a few major differences between Synereo and Diaspora that should be highlighted:\n\n1) Synereo is designed as a framework for managing the attention economy. That means quantifying network reputation with controls for how a message spreads across the network. Diaspora does not provide controls for managing social reputation.\n\n2) Synereo is equipped with an amplification function for another measure of control over who sees your message. These tools are designed to ensure that B2B networking solutions really work. Diaspora is not designed as a B2B solution in any way.\n\n3) Synereo is built with security and encryption tools inherited from the blockchain. Diaspora is decentralized but might still be insecure.\n\nFrom our perspective, Diaspora is an attempt to decentralize a first generation network, and we're really thinking about the next generation of social networking.

My concern, however, is permanence of the private key over time (perhaps decades) given that you are storing it in flash memory. I was hoping that there could be a more mechanical solution where the private key is actually set in a more permanent form, that\'s not so easily wiped-out.\n\nImagine a chain of 256 on/off bits. In my example, I used magnetic bucky-balls that would lock into a chain as the object is shaken which completes a circuit. The orientation they happen to take as the chain is built is either 1 or 0, so you get your randomized chain of 256 bits -- the private key.

If my first word in my Japanese phrase is word No.5 then the wallet would find the index of the given word (5) and then find the corresponding word on the English wordlist. Repeat for all words on the wordlist, then use as if English phrase.\n\nTwo major problems I see with this:\n\n1. How would you tell, just from the phrase itself, which BIP the phrase was generated under? If I generated a Japanese phrase under your BIP, which gives me a wallet from the English transposition\'s hash, and then plug it into a BIP0039 wallet... the BIP0039 client will not be able to tell me what\'s wrong... Assuming "empty balance must mean they\'re following BIPxxx" is not logical... so the user will be even more confused than currently. (People trying Electrum seeds in Mycelium, etc... our mnemonic "standards" are confusing as is.)\n2. How would you be able to detect the wordlist indexes if there are two wordlists from the same language with some overlapping words? BIP0039 allows for this, and it is not entirely unreasonable.

[...] the BIP0039 client will not be able to tell me what\'s wrong...\n\nYes, that would be the case. However, if the wallet follows BIP0039 closely, it should display a warning that the checksum is wrong. (And it is cheap to check whether a different protocol yields the correct checksum).\n\nAlso, if popular clients make the Japanes-to-English transscription obvious to the user (say display the English phrase in small print next to the Japanese words), it would be possible for the user to figure out what went wrong, e.g. by posting on a forum or asking an expert.\n\n> 2\\. How would you be able to detect the wordlist indexes if there are two wordlists from the same language with some overlapping words?\n\nWell, first, this is strongly discouraged to have 2 lists for the same language by the proposed standard. (So one could argue that introducing a new list after one has been established is already non-compliant)\n\nSecond, the standard suggests to use literal translations or otherwise similar words. To stick with you example (an EnglishNew word list without suicide or translations thereof):\n\n* "suicide" would be translated/substituted in a way that cannot be confused with any other word on any of the lists, e.g. something like "bad ending". The index of any other word would not change. \n* A phrase that contains neither suicide nor "bad ending" would work with either wordlist.\n* A phrase that contains "bad ending" is obvious EnglishNew and can be treated correctly.

The original *scarcity limit* of 21 million bitcoins gives each unique meaning.\n\nEthereum's *verifiable yet uncensorable* computational service **cannot be kept scarce** with adoption.  If a competing \xc3\xa6thereum service offers similar features, then there is **no network effect advantage** for Ethereum, that increases with Ethereum adoption, unless its mining network offers more security with more growth.  Some [newer cryptographic advances](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=88208.msg2425174#msg2425174) are poised (over the course of several years of research) to offer **verified computation at cost**, which nullifies the advantage of more security in a more powerful mining network (or a more diverse one - in the maybe-someday case of POS).\n\nIn the medium term, Ethereum needs to be tried, and the world needs to see what can be done with it!  Once competitors arise, value pouring into the Ethereum network will remain limited by marginal security advantage (such as from a better mining network), rather than seeing the power-law growth of a network effect based on adoption, unless some unique-to-Ethereum inter-application advantage takes over.

This will not entail full legal residency or citizenship or right of entry to Estonia.\n\nInstead, e-residency gives secure access to Estonia\xe2\x80\x99s digital services and an opportunity to give digital signatures in an electronic environment. Such digital identification and signing is legally fully equal to face-to-face identification and handwritten signatures in the European Union.\n\nThe card is not a physical ID-card or even a travel document  because it has no photo on it, but it does have a microchip with security certificates. These enable the card to be used with a small piece of software installed and a reader attached via USB to a computer. It works on two-factor authentication. To get access to a service or sign digitally, you need to enter secure PINs which only you will know.\n\nWhy should I want it?\n\nAs an e-resident you can use and enjoy the same great digital services that allow Estonians to do anything and everything digitally \xe2\x80\x93 sign all documents, launch and manage companies, do the banking, encrypt files, etc.\n\nFor a closer look on how the digital way of life goes in Estonia, look around at this site: http://e-estonia.com/.\n\nIt is especially useful for entrepreneurs and others who already have some relationship to Estonia: who do business, work, study or visit here but have not become a resident.\n\nHowever, e-residency is also launched as a platform to offer digital services to a global audience with no prior Estonian affiliation \xe2\x80\x93 for anybody who wants to run their business and life in the most convenient aka digital way! We plan to keep adding new useful services from early 2015 onwards.\n\nHow can I get it?\n\nWe will start issuing the e-resident digital ID cards by the end of 2014.\nTo apply for one, you need to make visit a Police and Border Guard office in Estonia \xe2\x80\x93 there you need to submit an application and provide biometrical data (your facial image and fingerprints) for background check.\nThe decision will be made in max. 2 weeks and if all is OK, the card will be issued to the applicant in-person at the Police and Border Guard office.\nThe one-time state fee for the card is 50 euros, other fees will depend on service providers \xe2\x80\x93 public digital services will be offered mostly free-of-charge, just like to \xe2\x80\x98real\xe2\x80\x99 residents.\nWe are working to add capacity to our embassies to process e-residency applications and issue cards abroad by the end of 2015 \xe2\x80\x93 so that you would not necessarily need to travel to Estonia to join us as an e-resident.\n\nLife in the Digital Society\ne-Estonia means voting in elections from the comfort of your own living room. Filing your income taxreturn in just five minutes. Signing a legally-binding contract over the Internet, from anywhere in the world, via your mobile phone. These are just a few of the services that Estonians take advantage of on a regular basis.\n\nFor their part, entrepreneurs can register businesses in as little 18 minutes, check vital company, property and legal records online, and even integrate their own secure services with the ones offered by the state.\n\nInteraction among government agencies, and between the government and citizens, has been completely transformed in e-Estonia, quickly making bureaucracy a thing of the past and making the running of all levels of government more efficient than ever before.\n\nThe e-Estonia section of this website details the methods by which Estonia is using advanced technical solutions to create a stronger economy, a better community and a brighter future.\n\nEstonia\xe2\x80\x99s e-solutions have resulted in:\nAn unprecedented level of transparency and accessibility in government\nSafe, convenient and flexible exchange of private, government and corporate data\nA healthier, better educated population with easy access to social services\nA prosperous environment for business and entrepreneurship\nDigital society and infrastructure\nThe e-Estonia digital society is made possible largely due to its infrastructure. Instead of developing a single, all-encompassing central system, Estonia created an open, decentralized system that links together various services and databases. The flexibility provided by this open set-up has allowed new components of the digital society to be developed and added through the years.
