Three with exactly the same title. We trying to set records?": 1, 'The recent drop in energy prices has dominated financial headlines in recent months, with the fallout having been wide ranging and somewhat conflicting. Consumers have received what amounts to a tax cut, and with more money to spend that\xe2\x80\x99s good news for retailers. At the same time, stocks are experiencing a decent level of volatility, plagued by many of the same factors that are causing oil to plummet, including soft demand, a strong dollar and continued economic weakness across Europe, Japan and even China.\n\nReceiving far less press attention is the ongoing collapse of Bitcoin prices. While this is not unexpected given the house of cards Bitcoin was built on, no one should forget that only a short time ago Bitcoin had reached manic levels. Investors worldwide \xe2\x80\x93 including high-powered venture capital firms and well-respected tech entrepreneurs \xe2\x80\x93 sang its praises, pouring millions into the virtual currency and confidently declaring that it was the next big thing\n\nThat seems like a long time ago indeed. Since late 2013, when Bitcoin hit $1,200 its value has plunged more than 80%. If one of the purposes of a currency is to create stability across multiple marketplaces to empower smooth transactions between buyers and sellers, then Bitcoin has failed. At this point, it\xe2\x80\x99s merely a speculative commodity, just like tulip bulbs centuries ago or even Beanie Babies more recently. And just like those fads, Bitcoin has peaked and is very unlikely to escalate significantly in value again.\n\nThe irony of Bitcoin\xe2\x80\x99s fall is that some of the attributes that initially made it so attractive to its backers like no centralized banking control, lax regulation and no transaction fees, are the very same things that are actually causing its demise. These types of decentralized monetary systems never work, since valuations are allowed to fluctuate wildly and there is a lack of trust in the system. It\xe2\x80\x99s simply not safe to hold Bitcoin. Look no further than the major exchanges, which have either gone bankrupt (Mt. Gox) or suffered major security lapses (Bitstamp). Both of which cost investors millions of dollars in unrecoverable losses.\n\nUltimately, one of Bitcoin\xe2\x80\x99s biggest problems is the same retailers they are trying to convince to accept Bitcoin. The problem is that retailers that accept them, don\xe2\x80\x99t hold them.\xc2\xa0 Sure, in theory, some say they will take Bitcoin, but most immediately convert them into dollars \xe2\x80\x93 which means every time someone uses Bitcoin to pay for goods or services the currency loses value. It\xe2\x80\x99s basically an elaborate Ponzi scheme. This is a major flaw in Bitcoin, if merchants don\xe2\x80\x99t hold Bitcoin, every time they are used in a purchase they must be sold to someone else, forcing prices lower.\n\nBitcoin investors are missing the point. When it comes to paying for everyday items, the masses do not want a virtual currency that is difficult to understand, fluctuates wildly and operates in the shadows. What they want is convenience and safety and that means electronic mobile payments in dollars. Such a payment system is just scratching the surface in terms of its potential. To build on it, the major players will have to come together and merge existing technologies, not only to make the system more widely available but more efficient. As most Bitcoin pioneers say today. It\xe2\x80\x99s not about Bitcoin, it\xe2\x80\x99s about the technology. There is huge potential for mobile transactions in dollars.\n\nAs you might expect, Apple AAPL +3.1% will play a major role. The company that transformed the music industry and basically changed the definition of the word \xe2\x80\x98phone\xe2\x80\x99 now needs to have a similar impact in the world of mobile and electronic payments. While Apple Pay was introduced last year, retailers have been slow to adopt the service, since it requires a significant investment in hardware. A recently announced partnership with Square could help solve this problem.\n\nOn the surface, Square, which is partly funded by Starbucks SBUX +1.7%, is a natural fit to help take mobile and electronic payments to the next level. But the company has hit a wall recently, having picked all the low hanging fruit in the marketplace. This is an opportunity to harness the energy it took to enable thousands of small businesses nationwide to process credit card transactions and apply it to making Apple Pay more universal. Many retailers like Starbucks are building their own mobile payment apps. This creates more of a problem than a solution.': 0}, ('Is there an updated list of where to use bitcoins online?', 2): {"it'll be good if there's a big list of all the sites that accept Bitcoin as a payment method.\n\nfor now I just use /r/Jobs4Bitcoins": 1, 'bitpay and coinbase show their clients partially. coinmap is for the physical locations but many agencies that work remotely are there, too.': 1}, ('Had a dream about Bitcoin last night...', 7): {"as long as we believe in Bitcoin, it's price will rise again.\n\nit's like a phoenix that once you think it's died it'll come back [^from ^ashes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_%28mythology%29) more lively than ever!!\n\n* here's [my take](http://i.imgur.com/zMTpVfh.jpg) on volatility..\n": 1, 'Lol man..

Well, so basically, the only figure the Foundation has from that KPI, is really not a good figure at all (meaning, it\'s not representative of the various wallets that are out there)!  How would we make one in aggregate representing Mycelium, Electrum, Armory, and Core then? (Not interested in the numbers for the web wallets, as I\'ve already concluded those involve too significant of a compromise / hurt users too much for numerous reasons I don\'t wish to argue in this thread - I\'m just here for the numbers for Mycelium, Electrum, Armory, and Core.)\n\nRe. Coinbase, they "sort of" publish their numbers, in the form of hyped up announcements, like their recent, "look at us, we have passed the two-million user mark!"  Kind of not a big deal, since Multibit passed the 1.5 million mark for downloads back in March of 2014, which was well ahead of Coinbase (which was around a million at that time). But it does make you think... what can you do to stay ahead of Coinbase, BitPay, and the Windhover group? Probably it involves looking at downloads in part.\n\n\nAlso, I agree people can try Core or Electrum (or anything) out and never use it again, but I\'m not sure that\'s a good argument not to have numbers.  I think there is an argument to track how many people are downloading your app per day just from the perspective of interest, and how many have downloaded it over time, etc.  How many installs, how many active if possible.  You want to know how you are doing by way of comparison with the web wallet crowd. ': 1, "That's probably the only accurate list of actual wallet users they have, since Coinbase doesn't publish that info, and using downloads of Core or Electrum is not a good estimate, since people can download it, try it out, and never use it again.": 2, 'Also, according to AK, close to 50,000 downloads from Chinese stores': 2, "Mycelium has 63268 installs from play store.

But I'm just one person. So whatever metric you use will have either abandoned wallets, or wallets that overlap, being used by the same person. Plus bitcoin is designed to be anonymous and private, so there are probably plenty of people who get wallets using some other means, or use wallets that aren't on mainstream sites (like Silk Road wallets when those existed). Best you can do is follow the number of transactions to track activity, but even though are screwed up by trading bots.\n\nFYI, Mycelium has about 100,000 downloads so far.": 1, 'Is the figure of 2,855,601 from [bitcoinfoundation.org/kpi](http://bitcoinfoundation.org/kpi/) an accurate representation of Core wallet users, or are they aggregating different kinds of wallets into that figure?': 1, 'If I understand this correctly... for Mycelium wallet, something like\n\n623268 (or more) installs from Play store\n\n\nMore from your website (unknown at this time)\n\nMore as downloaded/compiled from github (unknown at this time)\n\n40,000 approx. active installations (people using it right now, about)\n\nBut also,\n50,000 downloads from Chinese stores (and an unknown amount of people who are using it, or not, in China)\nDoes this sound more or less right?\nSounds like it is hard to get a grasp on how many people actually are using it but you do have a general idea (once you sum up downloads from website / git) how many total downloads and the approx number of active installs.

So, I am guessing, there is more to be known based on information from countries that... don\'t have access to Play. Just as an example.  \nI feel as though I am wandering into slushy territory.  How does one get a realistic assessment of how many wallet users you might actually have for (say, Mycelium, or Electrum, or...) and then figure out your downloads per day and then... have a KPI?  My interest in this is really in getting ultimately some kind of estimate at seeing how fast overall Core / Electrum / Mycelium and Armory are moving in terms of growth (download / adoption etc) versus the March of the Web Wallets.  And in the end If there appears to be bigger numbers, more downloads per day, etc indicating much greater Core / Electrum / Mycelium / Armory type use then I\'ll be a happier camper but I\'ll still be wondering what can I do to make sure that web wallets (Coinbase, Bitpay, Xapo, others) are left in the dust.  I am hoping to see some hard numbers and then maybe translate this into action to help promote wallets just like Electrum, Core, Armory etc.  - not just driving traffic to bitcoin.org because that promotes web wallets as well, unfortunately.\n\nOn the one hand there are things that can be done (like what Electrum does) that just makes wallets that are installed on a laptop and that remain within the control of the user just very lightweight and dead simple to use.  It could be even "lighter and sleeker" possibly but it is so simple, it is just very tough to object to, no-one can say it\'s "too hard" to use once the initial familiarity is reached.  \n\nOn the other is driving traffic perhaps to a site or sites that really advertise (Electrum, Mycelium, Core, Armory examples) really hard and get people to download them more, because I think promo-ing them on a site that is dedicated to just those kind of wallets (not web wallets at all) is very important, despite the diversity of wallets featured on bitcoin.org ~ I\'m not sure if this is necessary but it\'s part of why I ask the question about this numbers stuff and wonder how we are doing with our "REAL BITCOIN" wallets versus the web wallets.  And in light of the very real threat posed by web wallet corporations now jumping in bed with banks, we have to ask the hard questions and take extra steps which I appreciate the privacy advocates doing such as Electrum, Mycelium as real examples.': 1, 'Active installs is 40k, if I interpret the numbers correctly (currently on via my mobile) ': 3, "Yes, sums it up pretty well.

The heading simply says "My Wallet Number of Users" and from that I infer that it is "My Wallet," corresponding to the My Wallet service of blockchain.info \nSo what in the world is that information doing so prominently on the Bitcoin Foundation site?  If you ask me such information should be presented for Core (KPI) or **in aggregate** for wallets such as Mycelium, Electrum, Armory, and Core (a big altogether number representing number of wallet users for those wallets).

See my answer to /u/bitskeptic': 1, "Perhaps I will make the next video on this?  But here is a quick explanation.\n\nThe easiest way to understand it is to consider the COMEX can have a wheat futures contracts without having any wheat on hand.  How do they do it?\n\nLets say I think the price of what will fall and I want to profit.  I can sell wheat today, and then buy it later for cheaper and I can profit by selling high and buying low. But how can I sell that which I don't have?  I can place $'s as collateral with the exchange.  If I sell a bushel of wheat at $200, the purchaser now has an IOU from me that says I owe him 1 bushel of wheat in the future. If the price goes up and I have to buy a bushell for $250, then that $50 loss I made is taken from my collateral.  Notice I both bought and sold wheat and yet there was no wheat... just $'s.  In this case, it is said that the settlement instrument was $'s.\n\nSo what if rather than have a wheat futures contract settled in $'s.  We had a dollar futures contract settled in cryptocurrency?\n\nInstead of selling a bushel of wheat, I sell $1. I place cryptocurrency on an exchange as security for the buyer. Now in the future I owe the buyer $1 no matter the excahnge rate.  Either the rate moved up an I made a profit, or the\nrate moved down and money was taken from my collateral and I made a loss.  Either way, the buyer receives $1 in the future no matter the exchange rate.\n\nTherefore the buyers fully securitized IOU for $1 is always worth $1.  ie: it has a stable value.  And it is always backed by collateral (the cryptocurrency held on the blockchain.)

For example, if the cost of printing 1 US dollar (in terms of the raw materials of the paper, and the cost of running the printing machine) is 5 cents, then the seigniorage made is 95 cents. It has nothing to do with inflation, or economic growth. It\'s the difference between the cost of making a unit of money and the market value of said money, once made.\n\n2. Inflation is not quantified by the expansion of the money supply divided by gross domestic product. Your 35% math, therefore, is incorrect. QE did expand the money supply, but so far has not contributed much to inflation at all - inflation is still at historic lows. As for saving in a mattress vs putting it to work (either in the stock market, or in other forms of investment), that\'s what an inflationary environment incentivizes people to do. Hence my comment on deflation.\n\n3. You don\'t know what deflation is. Saying things so wrong that nobody else says them doesn\'t make you a visionary. A zero-inflationary environment is one in which the rate of increase in the money supply matches the increase / decrease in the demand for said money. In such a scenario, parking your money in a mattress won\'t make you any money, but it won\'t cost you any money, either. A deflationary environment, by contrast, rewards hoarding money. If you can buy a TV for $1000 today, but you know you can also buy it for $950 in 2 months, you might wait two months. It\'s not certain, but it\'s likely, at least for luxury / non-essential goods. And consumption of those kinds of goods drives a lot of today\'s economic growth.\n\nStop defending what you said, you\'re just wrong.

It is because of inflation the mattress is no longer viable form of saving - you are right in that sense.  As result entire population is forced to take business risk in the form of stock or bond holders.  If you don\'t you will be taxed at the rate of Inflation - for the least.  Yet, this is not the whole story - creation of stock market itself expands greatly the ability to print money (and hide inflation) by creating a place holder of assets that have to be parked there forever (on aggregate and continuous level).  \n\nThe latest example - entire QE (85 billion per month - over period of about 4 years) went into Stock market - thus rate of print at over 8% of US GDP per year - did not make a dent in the price of consumer goods, yet stock market went up. \n\n8% over period of 4 years on compound basis is over 35% Inflation.

Yes, you heard it hear first :).  One may argue - look at japan!  Cause of deflation in Japan is consumer\'s inability (important! - inability) to buy more because of lack of discretionary income.  That\'s not deflation - that\'s a situation where consumer was stripped out of cash to the point where he cannot buy anything any more.  Now they hope to print even more in the hope of deflating consumer obligation further, so that he would be able to get other obligations.  This is unsustainable.

It will have gotten to 30k mostly based on deflation of USD, not growth of BTC.\n\nI think that people have vastly underestimated the velocity of Bitcoin..  When everyone is hoarding it is scarce and difficult to come by and the price has to go up due to supply and demand.  \n\nOnce it transitions from the "digital gold" model to the "copper penny" model -- scarcity doesn\'t work like we expected.

I think people simply don\'t want to pay for stuff when there are so many free apps.\n\nIf you have an iDevice, you have already proven that you have lots of money, and don\'t mind spending lots of it.\n\nIt would be interesting to see a comparison between the iOS population, and Nexus 6 owners. Although it would still be biased by the general atmosphere of the markets. Play has lots of free apps, while on iOS, the sentiment is "pay for everything".

You provide a market-place to search for apps, and DC POS doesn't.  However, you stand as a middle-man in between the consumer and the developer, ~~so even when developers create applications using the API that DC POS provides, they're not going to be let onto your system, because~~ the DC POS API delivers funds directly from the consumer to the developer.  Payments usings the DC POS API circumvent even the skubit market-place.\n\nSo you're basically doing the same thing as the google play store, except you're providing a bitcoin payment option for consumers as well.  I suppose you have a different class of applications allowed as well, like adult content.  But so does a service like Mikandi.  So there's a place for it, like I said.  But for developers who want to deal directly with consumers, without having to pay large commissions, the DC POS API is far less expensive.\n\nPS.

So, some of the actually valuable projects are sort of just being developed in quiet. Counterparty being one of them.\n\nThis is absolutely true. Trusted third parties do enter the equation in this scenario. The problem isn\'t trusted third parties necessarily. The question is about how trusted are they. Like if Wells Fargo were to issue the asset and use it internally, I bet you\'d trust it pretty implicitly. this is abotu backend techs. If WELLSFARGOUSD were issued using Counterparty or something like that, you\'d actually be able to move in and out of the money on the blockchain with a high level of confidence that you could convert it back into dollars because if in the Wells Fargo system it would be as good as dollars. If you have enough institutions doing this, you end up with a network effect that requires a consolidation of the asset. So you might actually have them ask the Fed to issue and distribute the asset. Now, if you don\'t like the fed, that\'s an entirely different discussion. But my point is that this is possible with the Bitcoin blockchain tech.\n\nAnd it\'s cheap. If it\'s posisble and cheap, it will probably happen. I\'m saying that because this is possible, you actually lose the need to have companies doing remittance.

In that sense, your bank could be the or one of many oracles in a transaction. What banks will look like in the future is going to be mind-blowingly different.

For instance I can have 1 satoshi represent a car, but there is no guarantee that 1 satoshi will be honored as such without a trusted third party.

In this room, there is also a company ledger book that does not belong to any of the accountants.  The job of each accountant is to record every transaction that is going on in the company, as it occurs, and each accountant does the recording independently.  Naturally, some people work faster than others, so the accountants vary in their accounting speed.\n\nEvery 10 entries, however, each accountant must compare their ledger book with the other 9 accountants. Now, if the first accountant to reach 10 entries then shares their ledger book with the other 9, and it is clear that the ledger matches the majority of the group (i.e., at least 5 out of other 9), then those 10 entries is now "confirmed" as being legitimate, and is then also entered into the company ledger book for future reference. Nothing can ever be changed in the company ledger, which is why getting a group consensus is so important on what business transactions actually took place.\n\nFinally, because the accountant that submitted it first and also got it right ahead of the other 9 accountants, this accountant is rewarded with $X amount of currency.

In order to understand it helps to discuss: what is money? It's a way of exchange value. So when you hand a pound note to a shopkeeper they will give you, say, a chocolate bar in exchange for that piece of paper. They do this because both of you agree that the pound note has the same value as a chocolate bar. It makes like a lot easier then carrying around, say, a bucket of milk or something else the shop keeper needs which is a barter system. Instead we all agree the piece of paper or coin has a certain value in physical goods and the holder of that piece of paper can exchange it for those physical goods. Bitcoin is a digital form of money. You can use it to transfer value from place to place at an agreed upon price. Instead of paper, you're transferring information. And instead that information being stored in a physical wallet in your pocket it's stored in a digital wallet, a little folder, on your desktop. Or the information can be stored on a flash drive or an online service just like you'd store your music or pictures. ": 2, 'Thanks!\n\nCan you tell us when the trial is scheduled?': 2, '1.

Wallets are like email addresses. The public address is the one you share, and the private key is like your password. Anyone with the private key can spend the coins at that public address.\n\n4. Cashing out coins involves finding someone who wants to buy the bitcoins for currency, like US dollars or euros, etc..

Bitcoin gets its monetary value from its scarce supply coupled with market speculation.\n\nBitcoins can be stolen in a number of ways, but the most common is when a person trusts their bitcoins with another person. For example, if you send bitcoins to an exchange for trading, you are trusting the exchange with your bitcoins because you do not have control of the bitcoins when you send them to an address where you do not have access to the private keys. A private key is what is needed to unlock your bitcoins in order to send them to a new address. When you send bitcoin to an address where you don't have the private key, it is like handing over cash to another person who is behind a bullet proof window.

That person can easily run away with your money if they so choose.\n\nIf this person wants to run away with your bitcoins and cash out, all they need to do is sell those coins for paper cash.
