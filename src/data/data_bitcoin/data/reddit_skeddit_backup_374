I will say I can see how you can make the error. The root cause is in thinking in terms of BTC. BTC is just a term of convenience, because the alternative - what 1 BTC actually is - is unwieldy to talk about.\n\n"1 BTC" just means a certain percentage (about 0.000007% as of now, or one 14-millionth) of the total ledger.
