Privacy tech works best when everyone uses it by default.  for example, end users don\'t have to opt-in to use SSL. \n\n2) because it is opt-in, much/most of the funds may be "dirty". Unlike if the entire bitcoin economy used it by default, then most funds would be "clean", at least in terms of the immediately previous tx(s).\n\n3) Because much of the funds are "dirty", this creates a disincentive for those holding "clean" funds to mix their funds with the "dirty".

One of the primary innovations of Bitcoin was getting identity _out_ of consensus, as all prior consensus protocols had been extensively identity based.\n\nOften when talking about Bitcoin Adam Back will point out that if you were trying to invent Bitcoin but didn\'t know about it, but did know about hashcash you would come up with mining identities then using the identities to sign blocks.  One of the several problem with this design is that you can make as many alternative blocks that you want and rip people off, so the signature is mostly vacuous. Efforts to correct the cheapness of double spends so far don\'t appear to be (strongly) incentive compatible in the absence of subsidy.\n\nI\'ve seen the same designs reoccur many times, from most POS systems, to "pebble"-- now more recently Bitcoin-NG*. Applying a pure POW to the identity scheme breaks the POS circularity (e.g. existing members getting a veto on new members), but they\'re left with double spending (until committed to by later POW; so why not just require the later POW). Requiring a threshold could improve this but would greatly amplify censorship power.  I\'m am skeptical that this latest paper breaks that mold; but would be happy to learn that it does.\n\n(*) The Bitcoin-NG work combines two benefits; one is \'fast weak confirmations\' which I think is probably a real benefit, but weak enough that I don\'t know how useful it is; the other is eliminating propagation delays from the mastership race; which is valuable but can be done in an identityless way (and, in fact, I think without any modifications to the Bitcoin consensus rules.).': 7, '[**@roasbeef**](https://twitter.com/roasbeef):\n>[2015-11-24 00:31:23 UTC](https://twitter.com/roasbeef/status/668950002400497666)\n\n>Bitcoin Meets Strong Consistency: [*tik.ee.ethz.ch*](http://www.tik.ee.ethz.ch/file/ed3e5da74fbca5584920e434d9976a12/peercensus.pdf)\n>\n>Akin to Bitcoin\\-NG, explores decoupling Bitcoin "consensus" from txn confirmation\n\n----\n\n[^[Mistake?]](/message/compose/?to=TweetPoster&subject=Error%20Report&message=/3u3c2g%0A%0APlease leave above link unaltered.)\n[^[Suggestion]](/message/compose/?to=TweetPoster&subject=Suggestion)\n[^[FAQ]](/r/TweetPoster/comments/13relk/)\n[^[Code]](https://github.com/buttscicles/TweetPoster)\n[^[Issues]](https://github.com/buttscicles/TweetPoster/issues)\n': 1, '\n>Efforts to correct the cheapness of double spends so far do appear to be (strongly) incentive compatible in the absence of subsidy.\n\nDid you mean "do not appear to be?".

However, just because it's not what our government will allow doesn't mean it's not the solution we need.\n\nWhen I was a teenager, I could only get crappy ISDN for $120/month, and they capped me because my local telco had to pay royalties per kb of data transferred across Charter\xe2\x80\x99s territory. Charter didn\xe2\x80\x99t service me. My telco didn\xe2\x80\x99t buy bandwidth from Charter. They purchased it from Comcast, but the line crossed Charter territory, so they had to pay tribute. The telcos residual from the geographic breakup of Bell, and each region is given a government enforced monopoly over their plot of land. That\xe2\x80\x99s why there are no competing cable providers. There may be competition between DSL and cable, but never DSL with DSL, or cable with cable, because it is not allowed. The telecomm monopolies need to lose all of their government protection.\n\nIf the infrastructure is so expensive, they shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t need to worry about competitors coming in and laying new lines, because the presupposition is that no private capital could do this.   Hazlitt has a great exposition refuting this. All infrastructure is funded by private capital, and private capital only. http://fee.org/resources/economics-in-one-lesson-2/#calibre_link-37\n\nIf you are persuaded by Hazlitt, then we can see that private capital is more than enough to re-build the infrastructure. It has already been done once; no reason it cannot be done again.\n\nBut the issue goes deeper than that. The FCC is under complete regulatory capture. Its very existence is to ensure corporate monopolies on communication. An interesting book on the subject is The Master Switch: The Rise and Fall of Information Empires which was featured in parts on LTB.\n\nTo illustrate this point, the cellular market consists of one half that is highly regulated (the cellular service itself), and another half that is almost entirely anarchistic (the mobile device). In the past 20 years, we have gone from briefcase phones to mobile video conference stations. Keep in mind the first 3G phones (what I would call the first usable mobile internet) was only about 6 years ago. It\xe2\x80\x99s incredible to thing that we\xe2\x80\x99ve gone from iPhone 3Gs and Motorola Droids in so few years. Its self that the unregulated devices has gotten better at an astounding rate.\n\nIn contrast, the cellular provider has made little to no improvement. Verizon\xe2\x80\x99s billing and customer service is horrible. I was traveling internationally, and Verizon made a billing error (they added the wrong international plan). We called up billing and made an agreement to correct the bill and we would pay the correct amount (more than normal, but less than the $1000 they had charged us). 9 months later, 50 phone calls (recorded), 6 certified letters to Verizon via postal mail, talking with 2 attorneys, and writing letters to the Attorney General and FCC, we still have not resolved this issue.\n\nThe carriers have not lowered their prices, nor have they improved service. They are the most regulated half of cellular service, and they\xe2\x80\x99ve made only minor improvements over the past decades. The unregulated device manufacturers cut prices and offer more every year without fail.\n\nHere\xe2\x80\x99s an idea, instead of granting a monopoly, how about we abolish the FCC and we privatize the spectrum. Courts could transition to treating the spectrum as homesteaded property. As private property, it can be protected under the doctrines of trespassing and pollution. \nhttp://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4453898&url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fxpls%2Fabs_all.jsp%3Farnumber%3D4453898\nhttp://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4413151&url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fxpls%2Fabs_all.jsp%3Farnumber%3D4413151\n\nBy treating it as private property, it creates the incentive to carve out as many small channels as possible. Broadcast gets more expensive, and the incentive becomes to make things highly directional.\n\nSo\xe2\x80\xa6 we do away with the FCC. We do away with monopolies on broadcast TV, radio, aircraft, cellular, maritime, radiotelephone, medical, and every other government monopoly, and let the market develop the tools to divvy up the spectrum.\n\nAgain, I admit this isn\xe2\x80\x99t likely to happen anytime soon, but it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean this isn\xe2\x80\x99t the right solution.\n": 2, 'When encryption is outlawed, only outlaws will have encryption.': 0, "I'm currently at relatives for Thanksgiving and never see cable.

How do you foster enough competition for something like broadband while preventing the growth an an oligopoly? You need competition to be plentiful to make the business behave by fighting for customers. \n\nIt's easy to go ahead and say phone and TV can be plentiful in competition because of VOIP and IPTV that can use preexisting Internet infrastructure to provide a range of services to customers and this allows for a lot of such companies because they don't need to build broad physical infrastructure to provide a service. It's easy to have a hundred or so VOIP providers serve your area. They can do it from a few  central offices. But then you have something like Internet this requires a lot of spread out physical infrastructure and a dense enough customer base in that area to make it viable to maintain and invest in such infrastructure. So even if instead of 1 or 2 ISPs in your area and there's enough competition for that 5 or so ISPs how is it that those 5 don't form an oligopoly?

With this technology a miner could *prove* that the shard they\'re working on is valid, solving the problem of fake coins. Unfortunately, zk-SNARKS are bleeding edge crypto, (if zerocoin had been deployed a the entire system would have been destroyed by a recently found bug that allowed fake proofs to be created) and recursive zk-SNARKS don\'t exist yet.\n\nThe closest thing I know of to recrusive zk-SNARKS that actually does work without "moon-math" is an idea I came up with for treechains called coin history linearization. Basically, if you allow transactions to have multiple inputs and outputs, proving that a given coin is valid requires the entire coin history, which has quasi-exponential scaling - in the Bitcoin economy coins are very quickly mixed such that all coins have pretty much all other coins in their history.\n\nNow suppose that rather than proving that all inputs are valid for a transaction, what if you only had to prove that *one* was valid? This would linearize the coin history as you only have to prove a single branch of the transaction DAG, resulting in O(n) scaling. (with n <= total length of the blockchain chain)\n\nLet\'s assume Alice is trying to pay Bob with a transaction with two inputs each of equal value. For each input she irrevocable records it as spent, permanently committing that input\'s funds to Bob. (e.g. in an irrevocable ledger!) Next she makes use of a random beacon - a source of publicly known random numbers that no-one can influence - to chose which of the two inputs\' coin history\'s she\'ll give to Bob as proof that the transaction is real. (both the irrevocable ledger and random beacon can be implemented with treechains, for example)\n\nIf Alice is being honest and both inputs are real, there\'s a 100% chance that she\'ll be able to successfully convince Bob that the funds are real. Similarly, if Alice is dishonest and neither input is real, it\'ll be impossible for her convince prove to Bob that the funds are real.\n\nBut what if one of the two inputs is real and the other is actually fake? Half the time the transaction will succeed - the random beacon will select the real input and Bob won\'t know that the other input is fake. However, half the time the *fake* input will be selected, and Alice won\'t be able to prove anything. Yet, the real input has irrevocably been spent anyway, destroying the funds! If the process by which funds are spent really is irrevocable, and Alice has absolutely no way to influence the random beacon, the two cases cancel out. While she can get away with fraud, there\'s no economic benefit for her to do so. On a macro level, this means that fraud won\'t result in inflation of the currency. (in fact, we want a system that institutionalizes this so-called "fraud" - creating false proofs is a great way to make your coins more private) (FWIW the way zk-SNARKS actually work is similar to this simple linearization scheme, but with a lot of very clever error correction math, and the hash of the data itself as the random beacon)\n\nAn actual implementation would be extended to handle multiple transaction inputs of different sizes by weighing the probability that an input will be selected by it\'s value - merkle-sum-trees work well for this. We still have the problem that O(n) scaling kinda sucks; can we do better?\n\nYes! Remember that a genesis transaction output has no history - the coins are created out of thin air and its validity is proven by the proof of work itself. So every time you make a transaction that spends a genesis output you have a chance of reducing the length of the coin validity proof back to zero. Better yet, we can design a system where every transaction is associated with a bit of proof-of-work, and thus every transaction has a chance of resetting the length of the validity proof back to zero. In such a system you might do the PoW on a per-transaction basis; you could outsource the task to miners with a special output that only the miner can spend. Now we have O(1) scaling, with a k that depends on the inflation rate. I\'d have to dig up the calculations again, but IIRC I sketched out a design for the above that resulted in something like 10MB or 100MB coin validity proofs, assuming 1% inflation a year. (equally you can describe that 1% inflation as a coin security tax) Certainly not small, but compared to running a full node right now that\'s still a *huge* reduction in storage space. (recursive zk-SNARKS might reduce that proof to something like 1kB of data)\n\nRegardless of whether you have lightweight zk-SNARKS, heavyweight linearized coin history proofs, or something else entirely, the key advantage is that validation can become entirely client side. Miners don\'t even need to care whether or not their *own* blocks are "valid", let alone other miners\' blocks. Invalid transactions in the chain are just garbage data, which gets rejected by wallet software as invalid. So long as the protocol itself  works and is implemented correctly it\'s impossible for fraud to go undetected and destroy the economy the way it can in a sharded system.\n\nHowever we still have a problem: censorship. This one is pretty subtle, and gets to the heart of how these systems actually work. How do you prove that a coin has validly been spent? First, prove that it hasn\'t already been spent! How do you do that if you don\'t have the blockchain data? You can\'t, and no amount of fancy math can change that.\n\nIn Bitcoin if everyone runs full nodes censorship can\'t happen: you either have the full blockchain and thus can spend your money and help mine new blocks, or that alternate fork might as well not exist. SPV breaks this as it allows funds to be spent without also having the ability to mine - with SPV a cartel of miners can prevent anyone else from getting access to the blockchain data required to mine, while still allowing commerce to happen. In reality, this type of cartel would be more subtle, and can even happen by accident; just delaying other miners getting blockchain data by a few seconds harms those non-cartel miners\' profitability, without being obvious censorship. Equally, so long as the cartel has [>30% of hashing power it\'s profitable in the long run for the cartel if this happens](http://www.mail-archive.com/bitcoin-development@lists.sourceforge.net/msg03200.html).\n\nIn sharded systems the "full node defense" doesn\'t work, at least directly. The whole point is that not everyone has all the data, so you have to decide what happens when it\'s not available.\n\nAltcoins provide one model, albeit a pretty terrible one: taken as a whole you can imagine the entire space of altcoins as a series of cryptocurrency shards for moving funds around. The problem is each individual shard - each altcoin - is weak and can be 51% attacked. Since they can be attacked so easily, if you designed a system where funds could be moved from one shard to another through coin history proofs every time a chain was 51% attacked and reorged you\'d be creating coins out of thin air, destroying digital scarcity and risking the whole economy with uncontrolled inflation. You can instead design a system where coins can\'t move between shards - basically what the altcoin space looks like now - but that means actually paying someone on another "shard" requires you to sell your coins and buy their coins - a inefficient and expensive logistical headache. (there\'s a reason the Eurozone was created!)\n\nIf you want to transfer value between shards with coin history proofs, without risking inflation, you need all the shards to share some type of global consensus. This is the idea behind treechains: every part of the tree is linked to a top-level timestamp chain, which means we have global consensus on the contents of all chains, and thus spending a coin really is an immutable one-time act.\n\nLet\'s go into a bit more detail. So what is a coin in a treechains system? First and foremost it\'s a *starting point* in some part of the tree, a specific subchain. When Alice wants to prove to Bob that she spent a coin, giving it to Bob, she inserts into that subchain the data that proves that someone *could have* spent that coin - a valid signature and the hash of the transaction output it was spending. But the actual proof that she gives to Bob isn\'t just that spend data, but rather proof that all the blocks in that chain between the starting point and the spend did *not* have a valid spend in them. (easiest way to do that? give Bob those blocks) That proof must link back to the top-level chain; if it doesn\'t the proof is simply not valid.\n\nNow suppose Alice can\'t get that part of the subchain, perhaps because a cartel of miners is mining it and won\'t give anyone else the data, or perhaps because everyone with the data suffered a simultaneous harddrive crash. We\'ll also say that higher up in the tree the data is available, at minimum the top-level chain. As with Bitcoin, as long as that cartel has 51% of the hashing power, Alice is screwed and can\'t spend her money.\n\nWhat\'s interesting is what happens after that cartel disbands: how does mining restart? It\'s easy to design a system where the creation of a block doesn\'t require the knowledge of previous blocks, so new blocks can be added to extend the subchain. But Alice is still screwed: she can\'t prove to Bob that the missing blocks in the subchain didn\'t contain a valid spend of her coin. This is pretty bad, on the other hand the damage is limited to just that one subchain, and the system as a whole is unaffected.\n\nContinued... [2/3]': 19, "> But what if one of the two inputs is real and the other is actually fake? Half the time the transaction will succeed - the random beacon will select the real input and Bob won't know that the other input is fake. However, half the time the fake input will be selected, and Alice won't be able to prove anything. Yet, the real input has irrevocably been spent anyway, destroying the funds! If the process by which funds are spent really is irrevocable, and Alice has absolutely no way to influence the random beacon, the two cases cancel out.\n\nI know this is a simplification, however to help my understanding I want to point out that since inputs can differ in amounts the two cases won't cancel out. That is, using a valid 0.1 BTC input together with a fake 0.9 BTC input, you have a 50% chance of losing 0.1 BTC and a 50% chance of being able to spend 1 BTC. Or am I missing something?": 1, 'You can solve that problem by weighing the chance of an input being picked by the value of the input.': 2, '[3/3]\n\nThere\'s a tricky incentives problem here though: if a miner can extend a subchain without actually having previous blocks in that chain, where\'s the incentive for that miner to give anyone else the blocks they create? Remember that exclusive knowledge of a block is potentially valuable if you can extort coin owners for it. (Bitcoin suffers from this problem right now with validationless "SPV" mining, though the fact that a block can be invalid in Bitcoin helps limit its effects)\n\nPart of the solution could be mining reward; in Bitcoin, coinbase outputs can\'t be spent for 100 blocks. A similar scheme could require that a spend of a coinbase output in a subchain include proof that the next X blocks in that subchain were in fact linked together. Secondly make block creation dependent on actually having that data to ensure the linkage actually means something, e.g. by introducing some validity rules so blocks can be invalid, and/or using a PoW function that requires hashers to have a copy of that data.\n\nUltimately though this isn\'t magic: like it or not lower subchains in such a system are inherently weaker and more dangerous than higher ones, and this is equally true of any sharded system. However a hierarchically sharded system like treechains can give users options: higher subchains are safer, but transactions will expensive. The hierarchy does combine the PoW security of all subchains together for the thing you can easily combine: timestamping security.\n\nThere\'s a big problem though: holy !@#$ is the above complex compared to Bitcoin! Even the "kiddy" version of sharding - my linearization scheme rather than zk-SNARKS - is probably one or two orders of magnitude more complex than using the Bitcoin protocol is right now, yet right now a huge % of the companies in this space seem to have thrown their hands up and used centralized API providers instead. Actually implementing the above and getting it into the hands of end-users won\'t be easy.\n\nOn the other hand, decentralization isn\'t cheap: using PayPal is one or two orders of magnitude simpler than the Bitcoin protocol.': 14, 'I haven\'t written it out yet (still) or done a more detailed blueprint-ish description, but what I imagine is something like multi-layer ZKP based version of Lightning, including something like live updated Merkle Tree Hashes of every spent and created input.\n\nEvery organization in the "web" (such as chain store regional HQ\'s and payment processors) collects pending payments and bundles them up into a smaller compressed single transaction with a ZKP, and then international organizations use the Merkle tree hashes or similar to run **efficient** ***conflict detection*** **(no two bundles should ever contain the same UTXO\'s!)**, with the ability to request exclusion of transactions from a bundle by the organisations supplying the bundles with conflicting payments. Non-conflicting bundles are then merged and gets another ZKP. Miners then pick among the available bundles supplied by these organisations, and include their headers and ZKP:s in the blocks.\n\nEverything will then chain down to a set of valid non-conflicting transactions, and these organisations handle the storage of these separately (the data in them will be needed to actually use an output of yours in these bundles so you can prove your transaction is valid), but should be stored redundantly and SPV clients should be able to easily request all of them.\n\nBy having separate (deterministic) Merkle tree hashes (felicia trees is also an option) of all spent and non-spent inputs and all addresses you can essentially prove if something is missing or not, to detect censorship.

You just split up the blockchain the same way you\'d shard a database, assigning miners/validators a subset of the txid space. Transaction validation would assume that if you don\'t have the history for an input yourself, you assume that history is valid. In a banking-like environment where there\'s a way to conduct audits and punish those who lie, this could certainly be made to work. (I myself have worked on and off on a scheme to do exactly that for a few different clients: [Proofchains](https://github.com/proofchains))\n\nBut in a decentralized environment sharding is far, far, harder to accomplish... There\'s an old idea we\'ve been calling "fraud proofs", where you design a system where for every way validation can fail, you can create a short proof that part of the blockchain was invalid. Upon receiving that proof your node would reject the invalid part of the chain and roll back the chain. In fact, the original Satoshi whitepaper refers to fraud proofs, using the term "alerts", and assumed SPV nodes would use them to get better guarantees they\'re using a valid chain. (SPV as implemented by bitcoinj is sometimes referred to as "non-validating SPV") The problem is, how do you guarantee that the fraud will get detected? And How do you guarantee that fraud that is detected actually gets propagated around the network? And if all that fails... then what?\n\nThe nightmare scenario in that kind of system is some miner successfully gets away with fraud for awhile, possibly creating hundreds of millions of dollars worth of bitcoins out of thin air. Those fake coins could easily "taint" a significant fraction of the economy, making rollback impossible and shaking faith in the value of the currency.

Let\'s say I am a contractor, because I have been, there\'s no way in hell that I\'m bringing up payment complications that will potentially damage the deal, especially when a lot of upper management doesn\'t think favorably of bitcoin because of all the negative things they\'ve read on it (i.e. drug money, money laundering.) - I don\'t need my clients to form an opinion of me this way. \n1.

My landlord\'s a semi-independent old guy that isn\'t going to waste his time with bitcoin, and doubtfully takes it seriously    \n    B. My city utility bill would need to be paid in cash, and I\'m not going to take half a day to do that when I work 60 hours a week.    \n    C. My power utility bill would need to be paid in cash, and I guess I would have to mail them that. They typically only accept a bank account, though, and a deposit.    \n    D. Internet would also need to be paid in cash, probably in person at the branch office. Again, more wasted time here.\n\n\nAs someone who has dropped google apps in favor of privacy, microsoft in favor of linux and a mildly rigorous approach to FOSS, even shave with an old-timey double-edge razor, has used Gyft, etc, I\'m prime for doing something like this, but it\'s just *not there* for me yet. I want to be busy making money and worrying less about how to manage it. \n\nSpeaking of which, you haven\'t mentioned anything about investment - assuming that you don\'t take for granted bitcoin itself as an investment (it isn\'t) - How are you dealing with your 401K/IRA?

': -9, 'Bitcoin would have gone absolutely nowhere as a P2P system in 1999 due to a myriad of technical restrictions.': 3, 'One of the biggest misunderstandings all along has been this phrase "Be your own bank." It is simply the **wrong** slogan for Bitcoin. Bitcoin is digital cash and digital gold - it\'s money without counterparty risk, 100% ownership. That is *not* what banks provide - banks provide literally everything else except that! (At a deeper level, it\'s hardly even true that banks "secure" your money; they just remember it - there\'s nothing to secure, because fiat is truly virtual currency, in a way that Bitcoin is not).\n\nSo you can think of it as cash, or as a settlement system - indeed, \'cashing out\' is the most basic form of final settlement.\n\nThe problem, such as it is, with a cash-only financial system, is that you don\'t get take-backs. Which is of course the whole point! As I put it on bitcointalk some time ago:\n\n> . What we have here is the issue of layering. In the world of banks, it is also the case that there is such a thing as irreversible payment. But it is hidden behind many layers and only accessible to the most powerful financial institutions. Even a SWIFT international transfer is pretty close to irreversible; but it is also heavily censored. That network can only be used if a big list of conditions are met. And above that layer are the real "hard money" layers (to the extent that any fiat money can be "hard"). Interbank settlement (often on a batch basis e.g. Euroclear and Clearstream) and RTGS (where it exists).\n\n>So the everyday experience is one of interacting with non-real time and reversible payments. **Clearly the average punter wants to use that kind of system, including its time and cost payoffs, even if he\'s not aware that he does. Because he wants the right to get his money back, which he doesn\'t always get, but he does in the most clear cut cases of fraud**.\n>There is no reason a Bitcoin economy cannot have these layers.\n\nAnd recent developments (Lightning) may allow layers that are not trust based, but that\'s a slightly different issue - people *do* want trust based services for some of their financial requirements. Most perhaps? We just don\'t want to be locked into a profoundly (inevitably) corrupt system where the government controls the money, and the banks. The ideal form of money is controlled by nobody at all.': 18, ">Then why is everyone saying Bitcoin is supposed to transform finance and bring banking to the unbanked?\n\nWe're talking about p2p finance or be your own bank.

If you accrued a decent amount of assets, you either had a pile of gold or a pile of cash.

It's 100% open to all assuming basic infrastructure (electricity/computing device). Banks can simply say no account for you (for whatever reason, legal issue or otherwise).

Of course there will always be more powerful nodes but it is important that a significant fraction of individuals enforce the protocol rules.\n\nWe are bumping into the 1 MB limit frequently because that is the natural state of blocks; miners need to have an incentive to build blocks even after the subsidy fades away. Since the average block size is currently about 0.5 MB there is no reason to jump straight to 8 MB.

There is empirical data that suggests the changes of the last few years make most users not run full nodes.

Hard to verify actual causalities, but I doubt the 1MB limit we're approaching is playing a big role in the diminished node numbers.\n\n> A few days of testing bigger blocks is not enough to replace the empirical evidence we see every day. \n\nA few days of testing might not be enough to make final conclusions, but they are a strong argument against the thought that 8MB blocks would be an issue when it comes down to bandwidth/processing of blocks.\n\n> The more important issue though is that BIP101 proposes a ~41% yearly growth which is above predicted bandwidth growth.\n\nThis is IMO the only argument that has some merit. Something to reflect on, however: the relevant point is not whether this 41% is above/under predicted bandwidth growth, but if the actual max block size would ever exceed a level that is manageable by enough nodes.\n\n> Also there is the issue that an 8 MB limit is not needed at all...\n\nConsidering we're bumping into the 1MB limit frequently already, that even LN would require a larger blocksize than 1MB, and that (hopefully) more people get interested and start using bitcoin, I don't agree at all with your last statement.": 2, 'What was any reason to believe otherwise?\n\nBitpay is and has developed some of the best open source tools for Bitcoin.

Since the central bank no longer exists, there is no way for it to set an arbitrary (or more specifically, not market-generated) interest rate to pursue public policy goals. Governments would be able to marginally impact monetary policy via their borrowing (ie, selling T-Bills), but they would only be able to affect it upwards. IE, if the going market rate for sov debt of the same quality is 5%, they could sell them at that rate or a higher rate if they wanted to. That would attract more bitcoin, since it would be a higher return for T-Bills than the market rate of other debt instruments. But borrow for less than 5%, because nobody would give them the bitcoin.\n\nQuestion 2: Yes, there would be spillover effects. And they would be worse than they are today, where exchange rates can be manipulated by policy, giving more of a cushion. What would happen in a bitcoin world is exactly what happened during the start of the Great Depression when everyone was on the gold standard. Money would rapidly slosh around the world unobstructed, and those who want money in their countries would need to pay more to attract it from those who pay less. For example: If bitcoin started flowing out of the US for whatever reason, the US would like to reverse that, and so it would raise the rates it pays on (bitcoin-denominated) Treasury bills. That would encourage bitcoin to flow back in, possibly at the expense of other nations, who could follow suit with raises of their own to try and keep their money from flowing away. Carry on forever and you get everyone paying crazy high amounts to borrow bitcoin - exacerbated by the natural deflation in bitcoin itself - and you get the Great Depression scenario again, almost exactly. The same phenomenon happened with US-UK monetary policy in the late 20s. \n\nThe truth, not popular here, is that bitcoin isn't going to become the world's global reserve currency. It just isn't suited for that, and isn't flexible enough to be responsive to the needs of representative democracies, which tend to want monetary flexibility during economic downturns. IMO the likeliest outcome of bitcoin is that it becomes a bigger version of what it already is - an alternative, cheaper means of sending payment quickly around the world.\n": 2, '\n\nWe are all taught governments create currency, enforces it as legal tender and creates a monetary policy to govern its growth/constriction\n\nBitcoin is a currency that has a monetary policy that cannot be changed and is not under the control of governments.\n\nCurrency\'s value can be thought of as a thermometer gauging that currency\'s health.

Only some of the monetary channels would be hampered.

In sense of **MV=PY**, the main idea would be to influence PY by means of V rather than by means of M. \n\nAlso, looking at asian markets, where CB strategic credit policy is still rather popular, I can see credit policy becoming more of a fiscal policy issue  rather than a monetary policy one (like in the west). \n\n- **Even more, if the several countries all used Bitcoin, wouldn't that force them them to suffer economic consequences from weaker nations.**\n\nLooking at how contagion works, I'd say that the opposite scenario is more likely. Which is to say that the main risk is that things going wrong in LARGE countries (like Germany) have the potential to cause knock-on effects in smaller trading partners (like Holland, Belgium, Denmark, etc), and that these spillover risks might be somewhat more complex to mitigate with fewer monetary tools being viable. \n\nIMO, the eurozone crisis isn't about Greece as much as it's about the way that the greek situation is being handled by the European institutions at large.

A: relatively small views. B: caters to the niche that is already likely to know about bitcoin. C: already has an informative video on Bitcoin.\n\nNow, a video that explains Bitcoins to millions, on the other hand (an audience larger than the entities you mentioned) is very useful, as it gives a lot of people who were previously unaware of, or currently confused about, a good rundown as to what Bitcoin really is. This means, if millions of people now understand Bitcoin, we can expect some new adopters. If you don't understand why that is beneficial, I can't really help you out.
