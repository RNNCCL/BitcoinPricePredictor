The idea is that you should ideally run your own full node. Then your node will do what's right no matter what, even if everyone else on the network is breaking the rules. SW offers the additional possibility of SPV nodes receiving and verifying fraud proofs from full nodes, which would cause them to reject a longer invalid chain. Fraud proofs are also not democratic: SPV nodes only need to receive one valid fraud proof in order to act on it. But indeed, the fraud proof system might not work very well if an attacker can compromise the overall structure of the network by creating tons of fake nodes or whatever, so it'll always be more secure to run a full node.\n\n> How can an outsider who doesn't run a node see the signatures and make sure the transaction is legit?\n\nIf you don't run a node at all, you'll have to use some centralized website. Probably block explorer sites will store all of the signatures when they download them.\n\nIf you're willing to connect to the Bitcoin network, you should always be able to download at least the last couple years of transactions+signatures. Probably how it'll work in the future is that each full node will store ~1% of all transactions and signatures, so you'll have to find a node that has what you want.

The code from Satoshi wasn\'t very modularized, and the participants on the network haven\'t been very specialized.\n\nOver time, specialization of participants has occurred naturally (mining, pools, SVP, etc.) - and Segregated Witness & Fraud Proofs seems to be a major step towards "modularizing" Satoshi\'s original monolithic data structures (introducing a clean separation between validation and amounts & addresses).\n\nThe fact that this is being done so explicitly and naturally at such a "natural" location in the data structure itself (putting the signature data into one top-level branch of the Merkle tree, and leaving the amount and address data in the other top-level branch) is simply further indication that not only the *concept* is right here, but the *implementation* is also right. \n\nImplementing this "split" between signature and addresses/amounts at such a natural location will most likely encourage maximal simplicity (naturalness) when doing the further optimizations in code, networking, storage and memory usage, network security assumptions (distribution of proof broadcasting) - and I think we\'re already see some of this now, ranging from how SW supports a very natural and straightforward pruning of the blockchain, to how FP (Fraud Proofs) supports a very natural way of distributing and broadcasting validation data on the network.\n\nReally I think SW is rather breathtaking in the range of issues which it addresses through such a simple and natural splitting of data into validation data versus amounts/addresses data.

This is how Satoshi originally intended SPV to work (see the original paper), but due to some problems with the protocol it wasn't previously possible.\n* When you're downloading the entire historical block chain, you might choose to download and verify only 1% of signatures or something, which would reduce the initial sync time by 50% or more. Combined with fraud proofs, this is almost as secure as verifying all historical signatures (which Bitcoin Core doesn't do right now anyway - it downloads but ignores signatures before the latest checkpoint).\n* As a side-effect, it allows the max block size to be increased to about 4 MB with a *softfork*.

At a "meta" level, this is exactly the kind of direction I feel is most positive for doing upgrades and enhancements. I\'m not an expert in Bitcoin technology but I have studied a bit of crypto, logic, theorem proving, etc. as well as lots of languages, and this whole concept and implementation of Segregated Witness & Fraud Proofs from Pieter Wuille really sounds good to me.\n\n---\n\nEveryone (including myself) should also be careful of giving in to fear or suspicion, which has happened a lot in the past few months of the scaling debates with respect to block size.\n\nFor the past few months, I have been a very big supporter of bigger blocks (eg, BIP 101) and I expect that that type of upgrade is one of several we will take (eg, simply making more demands on the hardware, infrastructure - particularly bandwidth, storage, processing power).\n\nAt the same time, as of today, **I am also a very big supporter of Segregated Witness & Fraud Proofs** - another type of upgrade which uses clever mathematics to reduce our demands on that hardware and infrastructure.\n\nI have no idea why this sort of thing hasn\'t been more clearly presented before. I suspect many devs felt like it was a non-starter, simply because they thought it would require a hard fork. \n\n(This gives me a feeling that potentially other enhancements are also stagnating because devs might not see how they could be rolled out. Meanwhile there are cogent arguments being made that even when something *could* be rolled out as a soft fork, it can in many ways be better to roll it out as a hard fork (this is touched upon in the above reddit thread - I think Hearn posted an argument about hard forks being preferable over soft forks a few months ago on medium.com which made a lot of sense).\n\nI also suspect that maybe some of the Core / Blockstream devs aren\'t such great communicators, or don\'t always have time to provide progress reports on this sort of thing to the public. Over the past few months I did read a few things on Segregated Witness on Github (in response to some posts I had made in favor of IBLT and Thin Blocks). So I think there often simply issues about communication where users don\'t know what devs are up to (and why) - and also issues about organization and basic clean-up / housekeeping (for example, there are probably lots of BIPs already implemented as soft forks which should be officially "rolled in" - but devs simply haven\'t had the time / incentives to get around to this basic clean-up and organizational work).\n\nFor the past year, I\'ve been obsessively following pretty much everything posted on reddit (and sometimes other forums) regarding scaling, blocksize, etc. - and I must say that after seeing this presentation by Pieter Wuille on Segregated Witness & Fraud Proofs, this is the first day in a year where **I again feel optimistic about Bitcoin and would recommend it to friends and colleagues** (provided this actually gets implemented - and for once, I\'m *glad* this is coming from a Core / Blockstream guy, because it seems that that\'s the way to make sure it will get in =).\n\n': 8, 'Thanks for clarification.

Currently bitcoin network is very linear which prevents pushing mainstream adoption yet.  The current system is great for large sums settlement or small volume transactions but for every day usage by everyone it has a lot to do.  Sidechains, lightning network, tree chains are 3 of the leading candidates to solve this but there are likely others coming too.  This will just take development work/time/best of breed to establish the sensible way to grow.  It will inevitably happen UNLESS a competing alt coin appears that addresses this from the outset and gains traction.  Sidechains make it far more likely to be bitcoin based otherwise the alt coin will have to overcome the technical hurdle, bootstrap value somehow AND get awareness/adoption.

The point of these thresholds are to *indicate* when this has occurred, not to impart miners with any decision-making ability.\n\nThe way these rollouts work is that Bitcoin Core gets a new rule saying, "after 95% of mining power agrees, this rule is a hard rule and any blocks violating it will be rejected absolutely, forever". Then this new client is spread widely, the vast majority of full nodes adopt it, and then miners slowly reach that threshhold. Now think about what happens if 95% of miners agree, but then 75% of miners start violating the rule again. (Something similar happened in BIP 66.) The vast majority of full nodes will be hard-enforcing this rule, and will never accept blocks produced by these miners no matter what. Do you think that miners will continue mining on the wrong chain, producing coins that the vast majority of full nodes won\'t accept? (They didn\'t in the BIP 66 incident.) If they continue, do you think that they have much chance of winning economically against the vast majority of full nodes + competing miners who have every incentive to supplant these misbehaving miners?\n\nIt\'s been known since the start that you don\'t need miners to agree to this sort of change. You can just insert a time limit ("after such-and-such exact date and time, this rule is a hard rule and any blocks violating it will be rejected absolutely, forever") and forego the miners entirely. Miners will catch up or be left behind. This is how Satoshi always did softfork changes (which he did a lot of).

This is because mostly full nodes validating the entire blocks need this data, light clients may consume transactions with merkle paths without any witness data.\n\nThere are a few other nice things that it brings, but you are better off reading Pieter\'s and Greg\'s notes.\n\n': 25, 'An Airline only allows you to bring a limited amount of weight and bags onboard a plane for your luggage. They have to be fair and have a consistent policy for their passengers while at the same time recognize real life physical limitations and risks. There is a careful balance to be made where they make their clients happy with allowing them more luggage but at the same time keep the weight considerations reasonable for speed , limiting fuel costs and safety.\n\nThey previously had a policy of allowing 2 carry on bags weighing 10 Kg in total, but overtime with a growing economy their clients grew more wealthy and needed to travel with more bags because they were flying to Aruba for 2 week vacations, instead of 1 week. The clients were demanding more bags and up to 40 Kg of luggage weight. They had a choice to increase the size of the plane but the accountants and engineers were concerned because the fuel costs would increase and the safety of the planes may be compromised as well with so much weight. The sales department also voiced an objection that larger planes would cut down on their flying routes leading to less possible destinations clients could visit.\n\nIt was known since 2011 a safe and effective solution would be to separate the less critical luggage on a train or boat and the important luggage could go with the client to solve these problems but the airline kept delaying these changes because of distribution and contract problems with the railroad/shipyard companies. Redirecting every railroad or shipping route would be a logistical nightmare. Another concern is passengers didn\'t want their luggage being mixed or misplaced within the trains/boats as they were keen on some of the new quick luggage check-in and fraud protection processes the airlines were developing and there is no way they could get any of that with dumping their luggage on a train or boat.\n\nOne day a bright young engineer recommended a novel approach to solve these concerns. He indicated, "Look, we already have shipping agreements with Fedex/DHL and lease out a certain amount of space on their cargo planes that flyout from the same airports. We would have to increase capacity on them but they are efficient and we won\'t have to reroute all the trains or deal with the nasty railroad companies and our passengers could still bring their important luggage through our new fraud protection and quick check-in processes. Our passengers won\'t have to pay more and get everything they want. We will have to secure larger contracts with the airfreight companies but ultimately they will benefit from more business and we will benefit from more flight routes and clients." ... followed by an applause from the board of directors and some quick recommendations to roll out the long awaited changes immediately.': 13, '> Who or what is FedEx/DHL in this example?\n\nFull nodes who still have to process the higher capacity but due to be sourced from the same "airport" can conveniently handle the extra less necessary luggage (signatures) as opposed to using full node trains/boats processing the segregated data (signatures) which represent the complexity and difficulty in rolling out these important changes with a hard fork.\n\nThe data is essentially segregated between full nodes(freight airlines) and lite nodes(passenger airlines)\n\n': 5, 'It sounds like a John Grisham novel, thanks for the explanations though.': 5, 'so how does SW fix malleability?': 1, 'How do tie the right segregated witness to the transaction.

In so far as anything depends on a transaction ID, malleability screws that up. Maybe it has to do with the two way HTLCs. I'll have to look at it more to give a better answer but I hope that helps.": 1, 'It depends on what you mean by scaling.\n\nLet\'s be clear on one point: a "4MB" block using the segregated witness soft-fork has exactly the same validation cost and relay delays as a 4MB hard-fork block. Segregated witness does not make the block validate any faster, or be transmitted around the network any faster. However there is much more to "scaling bitcoin" than the cost to fully validate and relay a block:\n\nInitial block download is a concern, as discussed by Patrick Strateman at Scaling Bitcoin Montreal. The larger the blocks, the longer it takes to download the entire block chain history. Segregated witness allows the syncing node to skip the scripts for old transactions that it was not going to check the signatures of anyway, thereby shortening the initial block download.\n\nThose signatures which are downloaded can be thrown away immediately on a pruned node for transactions that are not in the wallet, a very significant cost savings for disk space sensitive nodes.\n\nLite clients have to store and transmit transactions in their wallets. Generally good things to do like CoinJoin bloat SPV wallets because they result in larger transactions with signatures from other parties that you don\'t care about. With segwitness you can prune signatures that don\'t need to be kept, resulting in a much smaller data storage requirement.\n\nThe implementation of segwitness being proposed includes other witness data besides the scriptSigs which make compact fraud proofs possible. This opens up the possibility of sharded validation for partial full nodes, better security tradeoffs for SPV nodes, and perhaps advanced applications like sidechain withdraw fraud proofs.\n\nAnd perhaps of nearest significance to scaling bitcoin, segwitness is one of the two soft-forks required for Lightning, the other being BIP 112 which is very close to being merged into Bitcoin Core. With both soft-forks deployed, the best, most efficient, full version of lightning can be deployed and payment channel networks start to be used to replace on-chain transactions.': 16, 'I wrote an "ELI14" or so here:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3th0py/sipa_proposes_a_fork_of_mainnet_enabling/cx6cunn\n\nThe only other thing added was fraud proofs, as far as I can tell.': 5, 'ELI5 could get a little tricky, but you can find an explanation from Greg Maxwell [here](https://youtu.be/9pyVvq-vrrM?t=1424).': 4, 'nvm, i got it.': 1, 'Who or what is FedEx/DHL in this example?': 3}, ("What I've learnt about bitcoin the past week or ten days", 5): {"I take no exception with your critique from a theoretical perspective.
