The strategy is aimed at protecting Reeds from big price swings that have plagued the virtual currency for much of the year\xe2\x80\x94and underscores how many business owners remain skittish about the long-term prospects for bitcoin.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe thought about [holding on to the bitcoin] but we\xe2\x80\x99re just not willing to do it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mitch Caan, marketing director for the Wilmington, N.C.-based jeweler which has roughly 60 stores, mostly in the Southeast.\n\nThe price of a bitcoin has tumbled since hitting a record $1,100 in November 2013 due to nagging concerns about potential regulation, the collapse of a large bitcoin exchange in Japan and the stigma that it is often used for illicit activity. One bitcoin was worth $318.10 Thursday on the CoinDesk price index.\n\nLaunched in 2009, bitcoin is an electronic currency that is created on computers and traded between people who store it in digital wallets. Although it has a core base of devotees among the young and tech-savvy, bitcoin has yet to gain a foothold in the broader economy, largely because of its perceived instability.\n\nMany merchants during the holiday shopping season said they were willing to accept bitcoin as payment\xe2\x80\x94because it costs them little to do so and could even help them save on the fees they pay for credit-card transactions\xe2\x80\x94but expressed wariness about the risk involved in keeping the virtual currency for any length of time.\n\nMany mainstream businesses have begun accepting bitcoin as payment for goods and services; Recent additions include software giant Microsoft Corp. , computer maker Dell Inc. and travel-booking company Expedia Inc. Those firms, like most businesses, convert their bitcoin sales into dollars immediately.\n\nThe matter of bitcoin\xe2\x80\x99s price volatility \xe2\x80\x9cis the first question we get\xe2\x80\x9d from merchants that are interested in accepting bitcoin, says Adam White, director of business development for Coinbase, a San Francisco-based company that processes transactions for merchants who accept bitcoin.\n\nCoinbase is one of several companies that takes merchant bitcoin payments and immediately converts them to dollars, and then sells the bitcoin. It has 37,000 merchant customers and charges 1% for transactions after a client\xe2\x80\x99s first $1 million of bitcoin sales.\n\nFinancial institutions, by contrast, typically charge between 2% and 3% for credit-card transactions.\n\nOverstock.com is one of the few large companies that retains some of its bitcoin. The online retailer, which began accepting bitcoin in January, keeps 10% of its revenue from bitcoin sales in the virtual currency even though those sales figures are falling short of projections.\n\nThe company, which originally predicted as much as $15 million in bitcoin sales revenue this year, now expects to generate just $3 million. It blames the shortfall on international sales that didn\xe2\x80\x99t materialize.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cVolatility in bitcoin prices doesn\xe2\x80\x99t say anything about the value of the underlying technology, which is a game-changer,\xe2\x80\x9d said Patrick Byrne, chief executive officer, in an interview.\n\nAdam Penn didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to worry about bitcoin\xe2\x80\x99s wild price swings when he started accepting the virtual currency at his vegetarian diner last year, so he arranged to immediately convert all bitcoin payments to dollars.\n\nThe strategy means that he missed out on potential big profits when prices spiked last fall, but he has also been shielded from the recent rout.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want to subject myself to that kind of stress,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Penn, who owns Veggie Galaxy in Cambridge, Mass.\n\nUnited Way Worldwide began accepting donations in bitcoin this fall, but \xe2\x80\x9cthere is no way that we would take the financial risk\xe2\x80\x9d of holding on to the virtual currency, says Evan Hochberg, chief strategy officer at the nonprofit.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are people who are looking to make donations based on their passions for bitcoin and we wanted to engage that audience,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Hochberg, explaining the charity\xe2\x80\x99s reason for accepting bitcoin.\n\nMr. White says that Coinbase\xe2\x80\x99s list of merchants is continuing to grow at a rate of 10% each month despite bitcoin\xe2\x80\x99s recent price drop. The \xe2\x80\x9cvast majority\xe2\x80\x9d of them convert their bitcoin into dollars, he says.\n\nDespite merchant reluctance to keep the bitcoin, accepting the digital currency \xe2\x80\x9cgets them involved in the bitcoin ecosystem and starts the ball rolling,\xe2\x80\x9d says Stephanie Wargo, vice president of marketing for BitPay Inc., an Atlanta firm that processes bitcoin transactions for merchants. She says the vast majority of BitPay\xe2\x80\x99s U.S. customers choose to convert into dollars.\n\nJeffrey Egan, a 27-year-old digital marketing manager at a vineyard on New York\xe2\x80\x99s Long Island, says he gravitates toward merchants that accept bitcoin for payment but finds it \xe2\x80\x9cperfectly understandable\xe2\x80\x9d that many of them don\xe2\x80\x99t keep his bitcoin.\n\nMr. Egan says he has tried to convince his employer to accept the virtual currency by describing how the currency risk can be avoided, but so far hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been successful.\n\nThe decision to accept bitcoin has been good for Reeds Jewelers, which is donating 5% of its holiday bitcoin sales to a charity that fights hunger. Since the jeweler started accepting bitcoin in June, Mr. Caan says bitcoin customers have been spending triple the amount being paid by customers who use old-fashioned cash or plastic.\n\nAt Mr. Penn\xe2\x80\x99s Veggie Galaxy, the pace of bitcoin transactions has slowed by half in recent months to about one a week. But the owner, who usually hedges the currency\xe2\x80\x99s risk, decided to keep about $10 worth of bitcoin he received from a business associate.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s kind of fun just to have it, but I\xe2\x80\x99m not expecting anything from it,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not enough to worry about.\xe2\x80\x9d": 5, "Except that I don't want a subscription, or another account, or to pay whatever sum they currently expect.\n\nI want a quick and easy transaction which charges what I consider a fair sum.

If the cartel has, say, 55% of the hash power, it can do this:\n\n* The cartel announces, a month or so in advance, that "We the leading miners have analyzed the grave situation of the network created by the low price bla bla. So, for the survival of bitcoin, it is imperative that the next halving be postponed for another 2 years.  Please everyone download the new version of the software (that accepts blocks with 25 BTC coinbases even after the scheduled halving) from this link .... Beware that, starting with block NNNN, clients running the old version will find that their transactions are no longer processed, and miners who follow the old protocol will not be able to collect their rewards."\n\n* Once block NNNN-1 has been mined, the cartel sets most of their hashpower (amounting to 53% of the world total) to mine according to the old protocol; but they ignore any block that is found by miners who are not part of the cartel, and mine only empty blocks, using their own previous block as the parent.  So, most of the time there will be two branches of the orthodox blockchain: one mined by the cartel, consisting entirely of empty blocks, and one by the orthodox miners, with some transactions in them.  The second branch may run ahead of the first for a while, but eventually the cartel\'s branch will overtake it, and will be accepted as the "true" blockchain by all the orthodox clients.  At that time, all the blocks mined by orthodox miners in their branch will be orphaned (discarded), and all the transactions that they processed will be again considered unconfirmed, *by all orthodox clients*.  The orthodox miners themselves will be obliged, by the original protocol, to forfeit all those rewards and start mining again from the last block issued by the cartel.  Exchanges and payment processors who do not upgrade their client software will not get any income, or will see deposits be confirmed but then canceled after a few blocks.\n\n* Meanwhile, the cartel will put its remaining haspower, amounting to 2% of the world total, to mine a third branch of the chain, starting at block NNNN, using the new protocol.  Besides postponing the reward halving, the new protocol will temporarily lower the difficulty, so that the block rate will be acceptable even with 1/50 of the previous hashpower.  This third "reformed" branch of the blockchain will contain transactions of all clients who are running the reformed client software.  Any miners who choose to upgrade their protocol and mine on this third branch will get their 25 BTC reward, that they can spend on any business that has upgraded.  \n\nKnowing this, most clients and miners would probably upgrade their software before the deadline, or by the first time they use bitcoin after the deadline.  Some die-hard orthodox miners could try to sabotage the third "reformed" branch of the blockchain, but that would not bring them any profit, it would only break bitcoin.  Once enough non-cartel miners have ceded and upgraded, the remaining orthodox miners would not even be able to do that.\n\nDoes this make sense?\n': 2, "If somebody did know, they'd be buying big time, and we'd see that in the price.\n\nThey wouldn't worry about manipulating the price downward to improve their holdings, they'd just buy, because well, they **know**.\n\nSo since that's not happening... nobody knows.": 1, 'The concentration of mining into a few big companies may be the first real flaw of the protocol.  Last time I looked, the 3-4 largest miners/pools had more than 51%.   If a company or cartel gets 51% of the hashing power, they can control which transactions get processed, can starve other miners to bankruptcy, and can force arbitrary changes to the protocol.  For example, they could keep the block reward at 25 BTC indefinitely.  They will become effectively the "owners" of the bitcoin system.

If the change requested by the cartel is minor (such as postponing the next reward halving), encourages miners to keep mining, and is properly marketed, it may even increase the BTC price.\n\nThe article I was referring to is by [the authors of this post](http://hackingdistributed.com/p/2014/06/13/in-ghash-bitcoin-trusts/) but more detailed.

So, right away, they can force those miners to adopt their "improved" protocol, and mine on the corresponding fork of the blockchain.

Our empirical analysis relies on publicly available data from the Bitcoin system, and is intended to stimulate substantive economic research. Broadly speaking, our empirical exercise documents general patterns of Bitcoin usage, and examines the use of Bitcoin for investment and payment purposes. We \x0cnd that while the number of daily users may have doubled every eight months, the transaction volume is\nnegligible compared to the domestic volume of U.S. payment systems. Our analysis of data from the Bitcoin system further suggests that Bitcoin is still barely used for payments for goods and services. In addition, the patterns of circulations of bitcions and the dynamics of the bitcoin exchange rate are consistent with low usage of Bitcoin for retail payment transactions. Finally, we provide evidence that the exchange rates between bitcoin and other currencies are not well aligned, which we interpret as a lack of depth of the exchange markets and as costly exchange rather than unexploited arbitrage opportunities.': 3, "It means there aren't enough people trading on the other currencies. If there were these spreads and there was enough depth (active trading available at those prices continuously), then it would be possible to arbitrage (risk-free trades by doing simultaneous transactions taking advantage of pricing differences).\n\nFor a very, very crudely simplified example: let's say the Euro and USD were trading 1:1. But BTC was $5 and 4 Euro in active markets. Then a person could take 4 Euro, buy 1 BTC, sell it for 5 USD, trade that for 5 Euro, and have an arbitrage profit of 1 Euro.\n\nBut because there aren't those depths with the spreads, it means that a person instead, at best, would have to be a market maker, exposing themselves to some risk of market movement rather than a pure arbitrage trade.": 3, "At first glance this document seems to adopt a reasonable ad objective approach to bitcoin and I thought I'd reply to it here. \n\nBut, on rereading and starting to analysing the document to formulate a reply, the more prejudicially I see it is phrased, and the more biased I see it actually is, so I'd rather trash it and wait for a less prejudiced and biased document to come out of the rederalreserve.gov.": 1, 'Thanks, these were interesting reads, if they had a few typos': 1, '> t as a lack of depth of the exchange markets and as costly exchange rather than unexploited arbitrage opportunities\n\nwhat does this mean?': 2}, ('Checkout my profile on Casa Bitcoin Social Network!', 0): {}, ('Blogger films how homeless man spent $100 on charity, raises over $94k in crowdfunding - can we get them to accept bitcoin?', 3): {'what scam? did you even go to the link? lol': 2, 'Yea so you get free advertising for your scam while donating pennies.': -6, ' Meehh': 1, '"We gave this homeless man 5 bitcoins.

The trick is with a 2-way peg you can always switch from the sidechain back to Bitcoin. \n\nI think what is going to happen possibly is there will be a sidechain with small inflation, that offers both anonymity, and faster confirms.  People will want to use this sidechain for spending and transferring as its faster and more private.  But in order to secure the sidechain, there may be some inflation and incentive for miners to mine it.  So you will transfer your 1 BTC to the sidechain and use it for spending.  But over time, if you want to change back to Bitcoin a year later, you might only get 0.95 BTC.  This will make the Bitcoin chain the preferred chain for saving, and the sidechain the preferred chain for spending.

Im not supporting ethereum who kept 30,000 btc. That's ridiculous.

I understand that money retains its value because of a self-sustaining bubble effect. The money that people want is the money that *other* people want the most. So the desire and therefore the value of a given money such as gold, or bitcoin, can sustain itself over time. However, in the face of a clearly superior alternative, I think that effect wanes. That's why I'm betting against gold in the long run. It survived until now because 1) for most of history it was superior money 2) in the age of fiat, which is more useful in many ways, gold was still a better store of value because it is not as inflationary as fiat. However, in the face of bitcoin I don't think gold can retain its value in the long-run.\n\nIn the same way, I'm not convinced that any coin will retain its niche just because that was its original function/intention. Bitcoin was created as merely e-cash, but may eventually become a ledger for all things. If ethereum is a superset of bitcoin, and if ethers represent not just value for the sake of value, but also function, ie ethers are actually useful for something besides transferring value itself, then couldn't it eventually become the preferred form of money ? Regardless of the original intention? \nI think the ethereum dev team and community says bitcoin and ethereum can co-exist to minimize conflict and maximize cooperation, but I'm sure some of them believe that if ethereum really succeeds, there might be no reason for bitcoin to be used anymore.\n\nThe only problem I see with that scenario is that bitcoin is a better store of value because it is non-inflationary, whereas ethereum has linear inflation. But even gold has (more than) linear inflation, so if ethers were actually useful for running code I don't know if the inflation (which decreases over time percentage-wise), would stop ethereum from being preferred.\n\nDon't get me wrong. I don't think Bitcoin's network effect would be easily overcome. There would probably be plenty of warning if another chain like ethereum were actually threatening bitcoin's existence, and then a response will be made. I think that response might have to include adopting the features of ethereum. I'm still not convinced that bitcoin can survive without adopting similar features in the main chain.

Instead of those issues, the Ethereum dev team is focused on providing the tools and resources that will increase adoption amongst developers, since they are the ones that will build the next generation of decentralised apps.\n\nThe truth is that distributed consensus systems will likely have several niches to fill. Bitcoin has done an excellent job of starting the conversation about the nature of money. Ethereum is more focused on building a "web 3" layer of protocols designed for a modern internet.

Bitcoin has 10's of thousands of developers working on it etc. The roots are being planted in countries with poor currencies.

It's Anti-fragile.\n\nEthereum seems like a great concept, but there is tons of competition competing to do what it is doing. I think the main point you are missing, is that Ethereum can work great with bitcoin, if it wins out over a bitherium sidechain, counterparty, mastercoin, bitshares, colored coins, maidsafe, etc etc etc etc. \n\nBitcoin has benefited from a virtuous cycle of gaining hashing power, which gained liquidity, which gained users, which gained merchants, which gained developers, and over and over again. Until eventually it has gotten to a point where there is hundreds of millions of Venture Capital that has been invested in companies working to make new products and services for it. Mature financial platforms are coming, we are eagerly awaiting an ETF, this liquidity would further the cycle even more. You are grossly underestimating how hard that is to do. Also there is so much value in the community, which I didn't even touch on. \n\nBy the time this all happens for Ethereum, where will bitcoin be? Things move fast, currency is a language, and many people will be speaking bitcoin by then hopefully, I don't see how this new language will replace bitcoin, especially if it becomes the defacto method of payment for the internet and or international remittances.

Let\'s say ethereum starts picking up steam, and people are using bitcoin to purchase ethers in order to run smart contracts and other DApps that only ethereum can do. Let\'s say it takes longer, but give it 5 years, or 10 years to pick up steam. Then at that point, ethers are digital currency that actually is backed by something, the ability to do Turing complete computation on a distributed blockchain, whereas bitcoins have no such function. I don\'t think "backing" is *required* for value (case in point, bitcoin), but given two alternatives, one that has value AND function and one that is simply value without any other use, then the one with function should overtake it, given enough time.\n\nThis is why I think if Bitcoin wants to *stay* the leader, it eventually has to incorporate ethereum functionality. Even if there is an ethereum sidechain, eventually, ethereum\'s value may overshadow bitcoin if bitcoin itself does not implement the features. \n\nOf course, this is only holds if there are no technical reasons that a Turing-complete blockchain can\'t operate as efficiently as the Bitcoin blockchain for transferring value.

Everyone wins but the end client, however they did get what they paid for.\n\nyou might be asking how the marketing company wins in this situation. "What about their reputation, the repeat business," etc. There is no such thing. Companies do not have the money to remake their web site every year or even every 2 years. Your average company goes 4, 5, 6 years or more in between sites.

But it is indicative of serious attention rather than casual dismissal. Also note that they're showing the growth rather than claiming a crash based on 2014 data.\n\nEdit:\n\n> Finally, a relatively small number of the large value transactions drive the average transaction value to levels of U.S.$40,000 value equivalent and are not likely to involve retail payments.\n\nO.O That's quite the longtail effect.\n\nEdit 2:\n\n> bitcions\n\nLove the typo in the conclusions. :-)\n\nMore seriously:\n\n> We find that while the number of daily users may have doubled every eight months, the transaction volume is negligible compared to the domestic volume of U.S. payment systems. Our analysis of data from the Bitcoin system further suggests that Bitcoin is still barely used for payments for goods and services.\n\nThis is all correct. And in my opinion, BTC just isn't a good crypto for retail. Its ultimate role is more that of gold (storage of value and large transactions) than that of silver (daily moderate purchases) or copper (small purchases).

I got out of finance after being, I don\'t know, halfway through or so when it became clear that basically the only way to make money in finance was ripping people off: no-load index funds were basically as good as could be found on average, while selling higher commission anything else (just jack up fees, actively manage, doesn\'t matter what it is) does worse in the long-run than the index fund.\n\nSo basically I could have had a lucrative career in ripping people off legally. But, no, obviously everyone in /r/bitcoin is too stupid to understand the economic realities these "Masters of the Universe" (Bonfire of the Vanities) understand. And that was the sort of attitude of the finance students: we\'re fucking brilliant because we\'re all in it to rip people off. And people say that *we\'re* the most greedy and stupid part of the internet. Well if so, it\'s because the finance guys don\'t talk finance when they go online, because there\'s nothing to talk about.\n\nWent into computer science because it would be harder but at least I\'d be doing something that had value. The other students were far more socially awkward on average (better fit for me anyhow) but they were actually smart.\n\nAnd yeah, this all just sounds like /r/iamverysmart screed, but your post (and a few late-night hours of reading more and more about different coins and problems and solutions) just brought it back to the fore again for me.\n\nIt\'s an oversimplification, of course. There\'s intelligence in the finance system, and rampant incompetence and stupidity in software. But if it\'s about averages: the average finance model is pretty idiotic. Finance works because all you have to do is sell the crap to someone else and it\'s not your problem. Hard to get that wrong. Software, at some point, tends to require actually functional logic.\n\nSo, anyhow, more than enough and far too much of a rant, but yeah, I think the tech matters, and it\'ll be really interesting to see the battle between the cryptopunks and the finance talkers play out. And, of course, there will be adoption and merging: finance won\'t die. And it\'s just possible that bitcoin might. But I\'m more and more confident in my 5-20 year \'medium-term\' prediction that cryptocurrencies will continue to be more and more important.

I think there\'s a few reasons for this incentive-wise:\n\n1. In software development, the skills required to launch software quickly are not the same ones required to create a reliable and secure release process. Blockchain.info did create a notable online wallet early on, but that does not mean they are good at reliable software processes.\n\n2. The ease of setup lures in users, but it does not idiot proof their security. This creates a mismatch because a low tech user is looking for an easy setup situation, so they choose blockchain.info, but they also can\'t possibly be asked to understand why they need an especially long password for their online wallet; nor are they likely to use proper safety precautions with their password.\n\n3. The architecture of blockchain.info\'s wallet means Blockchain.info can only do so much to hold their user\'s hands. This means users will continue to lose money even if BCI does everything right security-wise.\n\n4. Blockchain.info\'s wallet is a great hacker target because they have a large number of low tech users and help store a ton of BTC.\n\n5. Web wallets are harder to secure than standalone clients development-wise. Some might even say they are impossible to secure.\n\n\nIt\'s obvious at this point that they have prioritized growth over proper software process. This is always a difficult balance in business, but I think they have handled this poorly. It points to bad management which from my experience comes from at least one of two sources:\n\n1. The lead developer does not have the discipline to focus on reliable process over feature expansion while he also has enough control in the company that nobody can tell him what to do.\n\n2. The lead developer has too little control and people above him are forcing him to prioritize moving fast over anything else.\n\nRegardless, it just feels like they are employing the "move fast, break things" style startup mentality which is totally an inappropriate way to deal with other peoples\' money. Also, as long as their user base continues to grow and they continue to secure massive amounts of VC money maybe they feel that they have no reason to change. By their goals perhaps their strategy is working the best.\n': 8, "Yes, unless they change the values that result from the two functions I mentioned.

Instead, you analyze the costs and the revenues and estimate how well-established its business model is and how much profits it is likely to bring long-term. Then, if the price is low (say, the profits will cover the buying costs in 5-7 years), you buy it (i.e., you invest in it). He is an expert at this task.\n\nUnfortunately, this doesn't apply to Bitcoin. Yes, Bitcoin is a great idea - but investors don't invest in ideas. Bitcoin doesn't have cash flow.

Most wallet software provide a way to back up or export the key(s), some encrypt them so that passers-by cannot steal your bitcoin without also knowing the encryption passphrase, some advice you to write the keys down on a piece of paper (or print out) - typically known as "cold" or offline storage, etc.\n\nIt\'s really just like any digital file: If you lose/delete it without backup, it\'s gone.\n\nMost wallets also provide a means for importing backups/exports from other wallets (or previous versions of itself).\n\nAlso, here\'s some vids that may help:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5JGQXCTe3c\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9jOJk30eQs': 4, 'To be technically accurate you do not actually hold bitcoin in a wallet, what you hold are the private keys.

The second code is how you get it out again that\'s the one you need to keep secret.\nThere are different kinds of wallets obviously. For a laptop or a desktop I use multibit its a very simple desktop client. When you create a wallet you save a .dat file which is your backup. You can load that wallet on another device by transferring the .dat file to another computer and using the "import private key" feature. The .dat IS the private keys.\nAs for securing it you can password protect the wallet which gives you 2 factor authentication. I find this is secure enough for general purposes.\nFor long term secure storage of large holdings you do what is called "cold storage". These are private keys generated completely offline so there is no digital trace of them anywhere near an online system. I use paper wallets what I did is got a 10 year old laptop (it doesn\'t even have wifi) and printed out a bunch of wallets while not plugged in to the internet (that laptop will never touch the internet ever again) so the private keys are printed on paper, on a system that was not connected to the internet which means those keys are guaranteed to be completely secure.\nEven then you can still add a 2 factor authentication. That\'s what I do with paper wallets I print multiple copies of the same wallet and entrust them to family members in case I ever lost my own copy, but even if a family member went rogue and tried to rob me, they couldn\'t redeem the funds because when you enter the private key it still asks you for a password.\nI find this is the best way to securely store large amounts long term just go low tech, print the private keys on paper using a paper wallet generator in an offline system (or Ubuntu if you are technically skilled), password protect them and put them in a safe.': 3, 'Sorry, but this is incorrect.\n\nA given address has an associated balance found by summing all the previous input and output transactions on the block chain + memory pool (recent transactions not yet in a block).

A bitcoin address is calculated from the public key by a hard to reverse formula.  A wallet file stores one or more private keys, and usually the public key and address that goes with it.
