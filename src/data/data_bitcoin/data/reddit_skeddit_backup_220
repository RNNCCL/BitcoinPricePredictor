The hard fork threshold is 75% of the last 1,000 blocks, so they would need to do this for a little over 5 days straight (to produce 750 blocks in a row).\n\nWhat happens then though is as soon as there is a big block the fork begins.  When that happens, Bitcoin-XT miners (with 51% of the pre-fork capacity) will solve blocks on that side of the fork every 20 minutes.   But then the miners on the original chain continue mining at about one block just slightly over 20 minutes.\n\nSure ... you might think that\'s all well and good for XT.  But if just a small percent of addtional Th/s are added to the original chain\'s side (such that the original chain once again has majority hashing) they can outrun the Bitcoin-XT/big blocks side.  That then causes a blockchain reorg and the hard fork disappears as if it never happened, and Bitcoin-XT and Bitcoin Core are once again building on the same chain.\n\nThe opposite does not happen though.  Even if Bitcoin-XT/big blocks side has more than 51%, those blocks are ignored by the oiginal chain -- mining with less than 50% of the pre-fork total can continue indefinitely.\n\nSuch an attack is already on the playbooks.  "Faking support for XT" will increase the chance that the 75% threshold will be reached but then those mining Bitcoin-XT/big blocks will suffer if their blocks are not being extended (as the attackers/fakers are extending only 1MB and smaller blocks).\n\nIt would really be a bad idea to try to force through big blocks without consensus.': 4, "> conditions under which a double spend is certain to succeed\n\nWhoa, that's not right at all.\n\n51% (greater than 50% actually) is where double spends become possible...": 1, 'If you are talking about XT, it requires over 75% of the network for a sustained period of time.': 1, 'Because you always have the longest chain.': 2, '[Greg wrote a calculator some years ago](https://people.xiph.org/~greg/attack_success.html)': 2, 'Not if they modify it, they can fork anything': 0, 'Interesting.

Blockstream only recently pivoted to lightning and lightning needs larger blocks. At the same time Blockstream staff have had this same view for years.\n\nThen things like [these](https://medium.com/@octskyward/on-block-sizes-e047bc9f830) are irritating:\n\n* *"when Gavin and I [Mike Hearn] asked him [G. Maxwell of Blockstream] to put a specific counterproposal [for block size increase] on the table he answered with the Lightning Network (and 1mb blocks forever)."*': 1, 'With the tech improvements I just wanted to show clearly that growth = 0% is not the best choice.\n\nAs for your other point about consistency of BIP-100.5:\n\nAs I understand, what you are saying is that always any colluding miner majority of 51% can enforce a block size reduction below any limit "X" MB by simply not accepting blocks greater than "X" MB. Yes, theoretically true. The question is if they are really going to do it - because this would be perceived as a 51% attack against the protocol by the community and would damage the reputation of the respective mining pools. So I think just because they *can* do it, they not necessarily *will* do it. Especially because orphaning cannot happen in the secret, it is visible by the public. That\'s why I think this concern is not fully relevant in practice as it is in theory.\n\nHowever, I think you have a point here in that a too large (and too long enduring) "gap" between the protocol\'s block size limit and the miners\' actual preferences would cause tensions that may eventually lead to a situation where miners do collude and perform block orphaning in the way you describe it.\n\nSo, what does it mean? After thinking about it I come to the conclusion:\n\nIt would ideally imply: The new valid block size must be at the 50%-quantile (or at an even lower quantile) of the vote vector. (by the way irrespective of the previous block size, because the system is memory-less!).\n\nAssume for example that the vote vector (which normally consists of 12,000 votes in BIP100 and 2,016 votes in BP100.5) has only 11 votes for simplicity here, and the 11 votes are voting for an absolute block size limit of\n\n* [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11] MB respectively.\n\nWhat should the new block size limit be? Answer: It should be <=6 MB. Because, if it is 7 MB (due to some reasons of the BIP protocol\'s voting rules), the miner majority of 6/11*100 = 54.6% could enforce blocks <=6 MB by orphaning larger ones. That is the essence of your point, I got it.\n\nSo overall, this would imply that we should always have to vote by 50% quantile (or 40% quantile... at least a X% quantile with X<=50), i.e. the new max blocksize is always directly determined by the 50% quantile of the votes, without any limits or constraints, and that\'s it.\n\nPractically, one could introduce some deviation from that theoretical rule, i.e. a 55% quantile rule would probably still work in practice, because a 54% majority may be considered too risky for the attackers to start an orphaning attack on too large blocks.\n\nSo, coming back to the BIP-100.5 proposal, I take that your idea could be accommodated by adjusting it\'s parameters for example as follows:\n\n* P55=P60=P65=...=P80=P90=2^(512/512) = 2, i.e. a 55% majority is sufficient to impose any (almost arbitrary) change of blocksize limit from -50% to +100% per every 2 weeks.\n\n* The parameter P0 (default growth) would be of rather negligible interest in this case, because in most cases probably a 55% vote majority will be found to change the block size limit in one direction or another. Only in case of very balanced voting a tiny instantaneous (bi-weekly) default adaptation of 1.09% (=32.5% p.a.) will be done (or whatever "P0" is chosen to be).\n\nI think, after thinking about it, your point is very interesting and valid and should be taken into consideration for the voting mechanism, maybe BIP100.5 should indeed be amended to take this into account. Having said this, it is clear that votes that are *slightly* violating the strict consistency with the existing power structure should be no practical problem, because miners won\'t colluded to start an "orphaning attack" in a "low benefit/high risk profile", i.e. if they have only a small 51%-57% or so majority or if the blocks are just 10% larger than what they would like them to be, they are unlikely to start an orphaning attack. However, huge tensions should be avoided upfront by definition of the voting protocol, I agree.\n\nThanks for the good point.\n\n*Edit: By the way, also in the "other direction" tensions with the existing power structure should be avoided. This means, the quantile should not be too far below 50%, because otherwise the large majority of miners that would like to have bigger blocks but does not get it due to voting rules may likely collude to create a hard-fork. Of course this is a bigger step than in the other direction where a small block miner majority just has to reject unsuitable (too big) blocks within the rules of the current protocol. However, also the tension in the other direction should not be too large.*': 1, 'Wladimir van der Laan (the maintainer of bitcoin-core):\n\n> Yes, [my position remains the same].

After thinking this further, I found out that these other mechanisms are similar to a miner voting mechanism, but less "formal" and thus more prone to secret cartels etc.\n\nThat\'s why I thought that this should be better done within the protocol, so I thought about BIP100. But I did not like this strong bias of BIP100 towards 0.0% growth (and this even being enforceable by a tiny 20% minority) and considered this similarly dangerous as BIP-101. But none of the two solutions really found my liking when thinking it further.\n\nWhen I saw BIP100.5 I found its working principle and simplicity just marvellous. The parameters therein could of course be debatable - if a consensus is reached with the default growth tuned to 19% instead of 32%, so be it (even though I find the current parameters pretty reasonable). BIP-100.5 implies that growth is biased towards moderate growth instead of 0.0% growth to keep Bitcoin\'s characteristics more stable over time, but can be adjusted in the longer term, if needed without big debates, by open and transparent miner voting. Also there is this dependency on majorities in *multiple* steps: The greater the majority, the more growth can deviate from the default schedule.

In BIP100.5, why do we need a default growth rate? Where does this desperation for growth come from? Lets be patient and let miners decide how much space they want to supply.\n\n*"why do we need a default growth rate?"* --> serious question? I thought this is a no-brainer. You mentioned yourself technological growth (even if you seem to expect only a factor of about 8 in 21 years if I understand you right). Then people talk about growth rates, it is no *"desperation for growth"*, it is usually (and hopefully) the realistic projection of future technological evolution.\n\nBy the way, also **BIP100** has a default growth rate! It happens to be 0.0%, and because the number is zero, nobody seems to take notice of it. But as a matter of fact, **BIP-100** has a default growth rate of 0.0%, this cannot be talked away, and I do not consider this wise. I could ask where this "desperation" for default growth rate of 0.0% comes from and what justifies exactly this value. The explanatory section of **BIP-100.5** explains the situation very nicely and vividly - the bathtub curve of centralization. I think everybody should understand and accept these basics before discussing block sizes.\n\n*"let miners decide how much space they want to supply"* --> this is in common between **BIP100** and **BIP100.5**. The difference is that **BIP100** has a default growth rate of 0.0% (maybe in the expectation of 0.0% technological growth? Or due to another hidden agenda?) while **BIP-100.5** takes a pragmatic approach of 32% p.a., based on common projections and evolutions in the past. Both have in common that miners can deviate from the default growth rate. The difference is that **BIP100** needs an 80% majority to deviate from the 0.0% growth, which produces a very strong bias towards 0.0% (implying that 0.0% is the best "default" guess for future evolution, which I consider absurd). On the other hand, **BIP-100.5** allows to deviate from its default with much smaller majorities than 80%. Already 55% is enough to reduce of increase a little bit from the default, and the greater the majority is, the more the growth can deviate from the default. For example. if really a 70% majority thinks that the block size should not grow at all, this is possible with BIP-100.5. I consider this a wonderful approach.': 1, 'Ok, so I confused 70% with 65% - so even better for the "low-or-no-growth" advocates *(edit: yes, a 36% minority could increase the block size limit by 19.2% p.a.

Why is a moderate growth more risky than a 0.0% growth?? I think it\'s the opposite.\n\nI think you really have to take a step back, look, and change your way of thinking here. 1 MB today is not like 1 MB in 1 year! Technology grows continuously, HDDs get bigger, home data rates increase for the same money, etc.!\n\nSo 1.0 MB "tomorrow" (say in 1 year) is like 0.x MB today! And 1.0 MB today is like 1.x MB in one year (and for sure "x" is not zero). So 0.0% growth is as if you freeze technological development and DECREASE the blocksize for the next year while the user count does not decrease. And I consider THIS really risky!\n\nThis is what the "bathtub curve" of BIP-100.5 (and I also saw it in at least one presentation of Montreal\'s scaling Bitcoin conference) is all about (actually the right edge of the curve - the left edge is about user adoption). We have to understand that **the system of reference (=technology and user count) changes** as time goes on, and Bitcoin block size has to track that system of reference to keep its current characteristics. With a growth rate of 0.0% we will for sure leave our system frame of reference. So, again, the best we can do to keep the system of reference is to let the BlochSz limit grow with technology by default, and not stick to 0.0% by default. Because the latter is too risky. It is so clear and evident, I don\'t know why people have problems to understand it.\n\nThings have to be seen in relative terms, not in absolute terms. If everything around you changes in the same direction (technology, bandwidth, storage, user count) and you (=the block size) don\'t change, the overall system stops functioning the way it functioned before.\n\n...\n\n[Imagine we had had the discussion 20 years ago (the time of 33.6 kbps modems and 1GB giant hard disks).
