That\'s exactly how I want a company to be managed and to grow and move forwards.  \n\nIn this same article:\n\n>This bug follows another random generator flaw found in the Android operating system earlier this month.\n\nDoes that mean Android is literally shit? No. It just means that software has flaws. All of it. Even your prefer wallet, whatever that is, has, or will have, a flaw - all you can hope for is that it\'s identified before it does too much damage (Blockchain did this), patch it (Blockchain did this) and compensate those affected by the flaw (Blockchain did this).  \n\nThe second \'flaw\' was an update that went sideways. Again, quickly identified, all affected users notified and compensated if needed.  \n\nI blame the third flaw equally on users, Blockchain.info and their developers. How so? Let\'s see:\n\n"The flaw apparently came about through a series of bad development choices which all failed in the worst way possible. Bitcoin wallets are typically created by randomly generating a public address and a related private key. As a result, it is important for address and key to be truly random, or else it may be possible to guess the private key by looking at the public address."\n\nThe \'bad\' choices were in the most part dependant both on outside pressure and just that, a bad choice, which nobody could have known in my mind. Why? Here:\n\n"To that end, Blockchain used two sources of random numbers, in what ought to have been a belt-and-braces approach: it pulled a random number from the Android operating system\xe2\x80\x99s built-in random number generator, and then connected to online service Random.org to get a second random number, which it combined with the first."\n\nSee, Blockchain.info tried to make sure they don\'t fuck up the random number generator, even if Android\'s one is fucked up. So they said screw it, we\'ll use two sources.  \n\n"Unfortunately, on some Android phones (reportedly including devices from the Sony Xperia range), the built-in random number generator failed to report back to the blockchain app. Normally, this should have been survivable, because the app used a second source of random numbers."  \n\nThe way I see it, they actually did have a backup source for a random generator, and were prepared. They just weren\'t prepared for both points to fail in the same time, as follows:\n\n"But on 4 January, Random.org strengthened the security of its website, requiring all visits to be made over an encrypted connection. The blockchain app, however, continued to access the site through an unencrypted connection. So rather than getting a random number, as expected, it got an error code telling it that the site had moved."\n\nI see no problem here.  All I see is a very dedicated team which for better or worse, contributed quite a lot to getting Bitcoin where it is today. I\'m grateful for it, and use their services because time and time again they have proven to be reliable and trustworthy. Have there been bumps on the road? It would seem so - but they have an outstanding reputation of honesty and trustworthiness. That\'s what I want from my web wallet.  \n\nIf and when it becomes shit or dates, and the team have lost motivation and interest, then sure, I\'ll look at other options. Until then, I\'ve went through 14 major wallets and none of them has proven to be as stable and fully-featured as Blockchain. Mycellium comes close, but it\'s too complicated, ugly and barebones for the average user. I do use it sometimes, but I always go back to Blockchain. I need a web interface - it\'s a hot wallet.  \n\nJust don\'t keep more than what you would normally spend in a month in a hot wallet, and you\'ll be alright.

Tax money which people like Assad\xe2\x80\x99s billionaire cousin Rami Makhlouf evaded through offshore tax havens such as Panama.
