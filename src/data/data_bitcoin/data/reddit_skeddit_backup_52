There is no certainty of whether it will be good enough to actually scale on top of a block size that is too small. And the entire security of the bitcoin network is at stake because when you limit the blocksize you are controlling the funding of miners by your hand and that could actually result in the underfunding of miners because they are not allowed to let the network grow to a greater extent which could result in more money and thus more security.

You can only choose one master when the rubber hits the road.  I am very confident that Andreas would sacrifice his wealth if it meant a superior, or even continued, option for liberation.

If Andreas was right and some other cryptocurrency would fill that gap, everything would be fine.

And you can generate a master public key from the seed that allows you to safely monitor the whole wallet (key sequence) from online. You can create new addresses online for receiving txs without having the seed or keys. \n\nWhile writing down or printing a single private key is not totally terrible you gain quite a bit of flexibility by using a deterministic seed instead.

': 1, 'By RACHEL WITKOWSKI\nUpdated March 28, 2016 11:40 a.m. ET\n2 COMMENTS\nWASHINGTON\xe2\x80\x94One of the top U.S. banking regulators will issue a formal call this week for officials to start crafting a new framework aimed at governing the rapidly growing financial-technology sector\xe2\x80\x94a nod to complaints from traditional banks and startups alike that current rules both stifle innovation and provide insufficient oversight for new forms of finance.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about now is receptivity to exploring these issues and understanding these different models as opposed to saying \xe2\x80\x98no\xe2\x80\x99 right off the bat,\xe2\x80\x9d Amy Friend, chief counsel with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal on Friday.\n\nMs. Friend was previewing a so-called white paper on \xe2\x80\x9cresponsible innovation\xe2\x80\x9d that her agency will release Thursday, the first major move made by any federal bank regulator to try to provide clear guidelines for fintech companies and products, ranging from online lending to digital currencies.\n\nThe document is unlikely to include much in the way of specific proposals. Rather, it is intended to kick off a formal discussion between regulators and the industry over how best to create new rules and processes. The OCC, an independent bureau within the Treasury Department, will ask for formal comments and could begin issuing guidance and rules based on that feedback.\n\nThough many regulators are dabbling with studies and conferences aimed at understanding the new financial products emerging from the largely unregulated fintech sector, the OCC\xe2\x80\x99s white paper will be the first attempt at establishing a new regulatory framework. The OCC oversees the national bank chartering system, so many industry players believe the agency is better positioned than other banking regulators\xe2\x80\x94the Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.\xe2\x80\x94to bring fintech firms into the banking space under one federal regulatory regime.\n\nThe white paper is meant to spur a discussion on how to set up a new framework within the OCC so companies can have a main point of entry to submit an innovative idea, and to establish a clear policy internally so OCC officials know how to assess that idea.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are so many disparate points of entry now and we don\xe2\x80\x99t have a way to collect all of that information and come up with a consistent way of evaluating something that\xe2\x80\x99s innovative and then rendering an opinion,\xe2\x80\x9d Ms. Friend said.\n\nThe white paper is designed to try to address in a systemic way mounting complaints that a 20th-century regulatory regime is failing to keep up with a 21st-century financial system.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe fintech industry\xe2\x80\xa6is not stopping but many companies are scratching their heads in trying to determine whether their product is in compliance since there\xe2\x80\x99s not a clear, uniform direction from the federal regulators,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jerry Brito, executive director of Coin Center, a nonprofit advocate for **bitcoin** and blockchain technologies. Blockchain is a technology underpinning the **bitcoin** digital currency that is emerging as a way to let companies make and verify transactions on a permanent ledger without a central authority.\n\nThe OCC\xe2\x80\x99s new focus on fintech also marks a bit of a shift in tone for regulators who since the financial crisis have paid more attention to reining in risk-taking and experimentation.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnce the OCC thinks financial innovation is important, that\xe2\x80\x99s a big change to the regulatory regime,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jo Ann Barefoot, a former OCC deputy comptroller and now a senior fellow at Harvard University\xe2\x80\x99s John F. Kennedy School of Government. Comptroller of the Currency Thomas Curry is scheduled to outline the plan in a speech there.\n\nVarious regulators have recently started looking into fintech, but there has been little collaboration and guidance issued so far has been limited to specific areas like faster payments and vendor oversight. Federal Reserve Banks have periodically held conferences on innovation and the payments network in recent years. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\xe2\x80\x94which has increased scrutiny of fintech firms that come under its mandate to oversee nonbanks\xe2\x80\x94launched a program called \xe2\x80\x9cProject Catalyst\xe2\x80\x9d that allows innovators to pitch their ideas to the agency in the hope that it won\xe2\x80\x99t take immediate enforcement.\n\nCritics say the U.S. has been slower than other countries, particularly the U.K., to craft a more fintech-oriented regulatory framework. The U.K. launched \xe2\x80\x9cProject Innovate\xe2\x80\x9d last year through the Financial Conduct Authority to help companies work with regulators on how to launch innovative financial products in the market. The FCA is currently working on a so-called sandbox model that would allow innovators to test products in the marketplace under regulatory watch.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe U.S. regulators are watching what the U.K. has been doing over the past year and I think a lot of folks on this side of the pond feel like the U.S. regulators need to catch up,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Brito said.': 4}, ('Dont be mad at a chair for not being a table (coinbase)', 3): {'Turn your arrogance down a bit.\nI\'m not talking about a prepaid VISA - I agree, it\'s crap.\n"Shift" has a debit card that deducts directly from a bitcoin wallet.\nRight now, they cannot ship the card to Tennessee because of State laws.

Technically it\'s about the rules by which nodes are configured to drop txs from their mempools. Crypto-economically it\'s about how blocks being full might affect user behavior. I\'ll focus on the crypto-economic side of it.\n\nMempool continuosly rising would be another way to say that the "last person in line" gets continuosly pushed further back. By paying higher fee he would push someone else further back and so on. Continuously rising mempool means that "the last person" never gets his tx confirmed so I don\'t think it\'s realistic that the mempool continuously rises in size -- this, like I said, from the crypto-economic point of view.\n\nIn any case it becomes a decision about "how much are you willing to pay to get your tx through in x blocks of time". If you pay p1 you have 50% chance for the next block, if you pay p2 you have 50% chance for the next 2 blocks and so on. The shape of this function is very steep: Paying some reasonable amount gets your tx confirmed in some reasonable time. Paying less than that pushes the waiting time estimate towards infinity very quickly (assuming the blocks are full). There\'s only so many txs that can get written in blockchain per time t. If there\'s 101 txs and only room for 100, one of them is going to be pushed out. Paying more pushes someone else out and so on.\n\nSo it becomes a decision about "how much are you willing to pay to get the Blockchain confirmation for your tx in some \'reasonable time\'".

Don\'t be condescending.\n\nTo address the spam issue, the block limit is not an effective measure. A system that DDoS itself in case of spam is not a system that is protected against spam. Having block full or close to full makes it EASIER to conduct a spam attack as a small amount of transaction will clog the system.\n\nYour assumption that a limit must be imposed for a transaction price to take place is flawed. In economic terms, the block limit is a quota. The intended goal is to increase fee (on a side note, that\'s central planning) but that only happen in practice if there is no substitution good (ie there is a monopoly) and nobody can secure a quota rent. But that is not the situation bitcoin is in. there is altcoins (so, no monopoly) and there are way to create a quota rent (21co premined tx for instance).\n\nMore generally, a the fee raising faster than bitcoin\'s value is the sign of a system that is unable to satisfy demand, and such system as no long term economic future.\n\nFor miner incentives, there are fee and miner can pick and choose transactions. There you have supply and demand, there is no reason a market can\'t devellop and no need for central planning.

Uber raise to match supply and demand. Taxi raise price because there is a supply limit. Taxi is the "fee market". Uber is the market market and that\'s MUCH better.\n\nListen, these problem are real. Anyone with experience in distributed system know about these problems. Imposing limit at protocol level is a solution for none of these.\n\nEDIT: ha the all tx must be on chain point is not addressed, let me fix that.\n\nIf there are ways to do transaction off chain that people are willing to use, that\'s all good. The lighting network looks very promising. Yet, it is important that these innovations succeed on their own merit. Scaling off chain is cheaper, and that should provide the incentive to use these. If they are not used as expected, it doesn\'t mean a limit is required, it means that they must be improved.\n\nWanting a block size limit in order to push for off chain scaling is an admission of failure.
