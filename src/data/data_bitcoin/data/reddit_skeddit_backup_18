We already know that he mined coins early on so it won\'t be that much of a surprise when he moves coins. But as has already been pointed out by other people -- this also doesn\'t prove anything -- since Bitcoin was released -publicly- anyone could have mined those coins (or he could have simply purchased access to the private keys of any early block.)\n\nIf I had to speculate: I\'d say that in all likelihood neither of them are Satoshi. Kleiman\'s work was on digital forensics which means he was focused on doing things like scrubbing memory dumps for meta-data to find files pointers and then using them to find hidden files on disk. It would have required fairly low level programming to write the tools needed to do this (so its plausible Kleiman had the skills to code something like Bitcoin but still highly unlikely given how expertly the original source code was \xe2\x80\x93 so I\'d be surprised if the person(s?) who created Bitcoin didn\'t have a background in software.) \n\nConsider that Forensics is also quite a specialized field and that a person participating in it wouldn\'t necessarily have needed to know anything about digital signatures to do their work. Hashcash-style proof-of-work in that regard is even more esoteric and I\'d expect to see a lot more interest in general cryptography (and economics) if Kleiman was actually Satoshi. But if you look at what he replies to -- he\'s only really interested in forensics and talking about his own work. I think it\'s far more likely that the two of them were early adopters / miners who were intimately associated with Satoshi in some way (possibly they corresponded at some point via email like a lot of people at the time) but weren\'t actually Satoshi themselves. \n\nMy profile for Satoshi is a lot closer to the group of people currently involved in the Bitcoin-space, to be honest: people who find cryptography interesting (but aren\'t necessarily cryptographers) and enjoy programming (but aren\'t necessarily "software engineers" by trade.) This would make a lot more sense since all the pieces needed to produce Bitcoin were in place for years before it was invented: digital signatures, hash functions, and proof of work \xe2\x80\x93 so at the least I\'d expect some kind of evidence of an interest in those areas.\n\nTl; dr, I think Wright was just in the right place at the right time and that Kleiman was unlikely to have had the skills, knowledge, or time to have invented something as massive as Bitcoin even being an \xe2\x80\x9cexpert\xe2\x80\x9d in digital forensics. Both Wright and Kleiman strike me as men who were more interested in building up their respective careers as \xe2\x80\x9cexperts\xe2\x80\x9d through academic channels and the press, rather than people who are genuinely passionate enough about economics and crypto to have invented Bitcoin in their spare time. \n\nFYI: I doubt that Satoshi was a full time student or working full time because he wouldn\'t have had the time to create Bitcoin. Unless they were being paid to work on Bitcoin ... or it was part of some thesis, but so far we\'ve seen no proof of that.': 3, 'Probably the best analysis I have read so far.

One camp wants to prioritize Bitcoin's decentralized traits even if it means slower adoption, while another camp wants to focus on adoption even if there would be substantial risk of severe centralization, or even permanently stalling the entire network (literally). Last summer the latter camp got really worked up about increasing the block size limit (currently 1MB) 'because adoption', and a former developer released a client that attempted to do so by force (a big no-no). All hell broke loose, which ultimately resulted in strict moderation and a fractured community. The attempt failed, as well as the two attempts that followed. During all this, Bitcoin developers have held several conferences to present the latest research and their best proposals to scale Bitcoin while maintaining decentralization, but those solutions take time to code, test and deploy. Steady progress is being made, but the community is still fractured. People who prioritize decentralization are very defensive as a result of the social engineering campaigns that took place, and people who advocated for the block size increase are generally very bitter because their solution was rejected by the ecosystem several times over. It's been a very nuanced debate, but I think we're through the worst of it. Cults of personality are crumbling, while pragmatic scaling solutions are being developed and deployed. \n\nYou know how redditors love drama and contention? Add money to the mix and weird shit happens.": 2, '[removed]': 2, "Remember that the only reason Bitcoin functions at all is because everyone agrees to the rules. Without very strong consensus as to what the rules are, things can go haywire pretty quick. In order to change those rules, the vast majority need to agree (90%+ by some estimates). If only 60-75% agree, then the network could experience catastrophic consensus failure, and the world's first and longest blockchain would be tossed in the trash bin. Therefore changes to the core protocol must go through extremely rigorous debate, review and testing. The initial client I mentioned which tried to subvert the network through social engineering was later proven to be extremely risky for numerous, and would likely have caused irreparable damage to the network. Thankfully the majority of technical experts in the developer community were able to weather the storm, and we now know that there are various superior solutions. Keep in mind that this isn't just about adding 'a new feature'. This is about changing fundamental protocol rules that are in place as a defense against spam attacks. A measured scientific approach is necessary to lay the groundwork for additional layers to be built on top of the Bitcoin network.\n\nIt's true that miners can effect a 'vote' with their hashing power, but they're not the final word. If people at home don't run that code on their own full nodes, then those miners' blocks will be rejected and the network will carry on. Same is true for developers... miners don't have to run their code. The point is that the network is designed to be incredibly difficult to change unless virtually everyone agrees. Of course, if some developer team doesn't have enough 'votes', they are free to fork the blockchain and go on their way, leaving the main network unsullied. \n\nYeah, it's a lot of political drama. Might as well get used to it though, because this is only one of many struggles that Bitcoin will face as it continues to grow. Luckily, reddit doesn't hold a whole lot of sway in terms of development direction. That would be kind of like reddit building rockets for SpaceX... fun to watch, but not much good comes out of it.

It would get even worse if miners could no longer propagate blocks to and from the network. Orphaned blocks would increase, and the problem would cascade across the network like a snowball gaining mass. If enough miners get kicked off the network in a short enough time frame, hash rate difficulty won't drop enough and the remaining miners would spend hours, days or weeks to find a single block. It would be considered a lethal blow. \n\nUnderstanding that the protocol is intended to be trustless (less trust) goes a long way to explaining why people tend to be defensive and skeptical of people trying to exert influence over the protocol.

Why the Core Devs (who have actually saved Bitcoin from numerous real problems). And the Lightning Network guys. An interesting discrepancy.\n\nAnd Gavin\'s operating thesis at the moment is that the "no trust" / "trust only in math" foundation of Bitcoin should be abandoned, and that we should not consider a situation in which a miner abuses this trust.\n\n    Any theoretical attack that begins with \'51% of miners....\' is just not interesting. 51% of miners deciding to be evil is outside the Bitcoin threat model.\n\n    If you don\'t trust miners to want bitcoin to succeed then you should move to a proof of stake coin\n\nAnd the actual Satoshi on matters of trust?\n\n    everything is based on crypto proof instead of trust\n\n': 18, 'No. You are talking about 2013 MtGox.

A gradual increase in transaction fees is better than no increase at all, else how do we get from mining being paid for by inflation to mining being paid for by transaction fees?\n\nCLAM has a 1 CLAM per block reward with no halving.

It maybe he has, but there was plenty of digging done 5 months ago including published papers of his which where mostly psuedo nonesnes. \n\nOne thing that is interesting is that Craig Wright does not have anything in has past nor Does Dave Kleiman that would indicate they knew enough to create bitcoin. Certainly they did not have the backgrounds or pedigrees that people like Hal Finney, Adam Back, Nick Szabo, and Peter Todd, Wei Dai, and many others, including the fact that they have published papers, works and community interactions.\n\nStill its possible, many great inventions are done by amateurs who know enough but not enough to prevent them from attempting the impossible.\n\nWhat is most interesting is What Does Craig Wright know or convey socially the convinced Matonis and Gavin that he was Satoshi.\n\nThe personal details are most curious.\n': 4, 'Would you bet your life that Craig Wright is not Satoshi?
