': 1, '> How are they managed? \n\nIt\'s a corporation so there are directors, board meetings, yearly filings etc. But in this case we are talking about a corporation with one very specific purpose: to hold BTC and to issue shares. \n\n> do they have any public disclosure requirements for assets on hand? \n\nOh yes, because they are publicly traded they must report certain things on a regular basis. GBTC is listed on the OTCBB exchange, which has less rigorous requirements than NASDAQ or NYSE. That\'s why they got to market before the COIN ETF - it\'s a much simpler regulatory process. See GBTC\'s filings here: http://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/GBTC/filings\nIn particular, have a look at "Interim financial report", releases 3/11.\n\n> how are they priced? \n\nThe market buys/sells shares at whatever they want. However, the fund either issues or buys back shares from the market on a daily basis, in order to keep the ratio of shares outstanding in a targeted proportion to the amount of BTC in its vaults. This strongly encourages the market to trade the fund at close to NAV (net asset value).  \n\nIn other words, when people buy shares of the fund, the share price will go up. But then the fund will go buy BTC on the open market to bring it back into equilibrium. This is an arbitrage opportunity so the prices shouldn\'t get too far off from each other.\n\n> what legal structure do they have? \n\nIt\'s a public corporation with shares.\n\n> How do they make money? \n\nThe fund charges shareholders 2% per annum on its holdings. Also, the "authorized participants" (designated parties who actually add/remove bitcoin from the fund) may earn an arbitrage premium.\n\n> What do they spend their money on? \n\nSalaries for internal people - I\'d guess at least a couple dozen. And then lawyers - lots of lawyers.\n\n> Is the ownership in a fund transparent? \n\nIf more info were available it would be found under "shareholders of record" here: http://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/GBTC/profile\n\nOfficers are listed.\n\n> What are the risks beyond the risks associated with bitcoin? etc. e. t. c.\n\nThe fund is supposed to make a best effort to secure bitcoin on your behalf. However, as we know bitcoins sometimes get stolen anyway. You are outsourcing the task of holding bitcoins to someone else, but not necessarily the risk of doing so. If they get robbed, the value of the fund will fall accordingly and you will probably never see that value returned.\n\nThere is also the possibility of insider fraud - the fund could imaginably SAY that they\'re acquiring bitcoin to back their shares, but not actually do so. Some people suspect that this is what the GLD ETF has done. In such case, the fraud could proceed for quite some time, and the effect would be a suppression of the bitcoin price because they\'re not actually buying and vaulting the commodity. Hopefully they will do some proof-of-holdings, which is easy with bitcoin but hard with gold.\n\nPersonally I\'d rather hold BTC myself. But I think these instruments will be very popular among people who want a little exposure to BTC, but don\'t have the time or technical acumen to figure out how to trade and hold it. Also people who want to hold some in a retirement account for prefential tax treatment.

Fees do apply, though.': 1, 'Solid info as usual. How do utility companies use m-pesa when the limits are so small? ': 2, 'For those who would like a TL;DR:\n\nM-Pesa has been in Kenya since 2006, but over the past 3-4 years there has been an exponential increase in its use. An American woman who was interviewed at some point said that now her economic life is about 95% cashless. People use M-Pesa by depositing and withdrawing money at various tellers, who in return credit or withdraw a certain amount of funds from their accounts (much like with Abra). Sometimes there are technical problems and the money might take the whole day to arrive or might be sent back. Fees become larger and larger as transactions get smaller (sending $1 costs about $1.6; a breakdown of M-Pesa fees can be found [here](http://www.hapakenya.com/new-mpesa-charges/)). About half of the rural and unbanked population of Kenya uses M-Pesa at this point.\n\nTowards the end of the video they discuss (and here is where it gets interesting) how Safaricom (the company who runs the M-Pesa system) is starting to use its monopoly power to act as a gatekeeper and "keep startups from using the system". This was not explained well and no examples were given, but it is an expected step of the process which brings players, once they have established themselves, to use their influence to extract rather than create value. For obvious reasons, this opens a door for Bitcoin. A second problem they mention is that M-Pesa cannot work for large transactions or for merchants, since it leaves no paper trail.': 5, 'They subverted the video': 1, "I agree, are they trying to get into your subconscious or something cause it didn't work.": 2, 'Call me a cynic but there is exactly 1 bitcoin node listed for the entire country of Kenya.\nBut from 0 to 1 is 10000000%+ growth!': 1, 'try to post it on /r/africa.': 2, "Nodes don't mean much.

There are two other methods for merchants under the label "Lipa na M-Pesa" (Swahili for "Pay with M-Pesa").  \n\nOne method uses a "Pay Bill" number.  This is what utilities and others use.  This uses a different menu on the SIM-based Safaricom/M-Pesa app.  The customer sends a payment using the merchant\'s Pay Bill number and then in something like a comment field where entered is the customer account number that the payment is for.   Then the customer enters the amount to pay and the M-Pesa PIN for the account and the funds are sent.  This requires an intermediary, I believe -- something like PesaPal, to notify the merchant and to eventually deliver the funds (via daily sweep/bank transfer, I believe).\n\nA second payment type under the "Lipa na M-Pesa" label is the "Buy Goods & Services".   For this the customer simply enters the "Till Number", amount and M-Pesa PIN.   The merchant generally uses the amount (which usually is unique) to identify which customer the payment is for.  (Yes, that can cause mixup problems when two customers owe the same amount at about the same time.)\n\nNeither of these services have limits for the merchant receiving the money (other than that the customer cannot spend more than the balance in the account -- thus there is no payment larger than 100,000 Ksh, worth about $1,100, that can be paid in a single transaction.)\n\nBoth of these require the merchant to go through a sign up process (with a third party).  Most retailers that accept M-Pesa use the Lipa Na M-Pesa "Till Number" method.  Only utilities and other larger operations use the "Bill Pay" service.  BitPesa, which accepts M-Pesa for payment when they sell Bitcoins uses that  "Bill Pay" for that.  Some smaller shops still accept M-Pesa using the Send Money/Person-To-Person method but that is more costly to both the sender and receiver.\n\n(Incidentally, the "Till Number" method costs the merchant 1%, and there is no charge to the person that sends the payment.)\n\nSo while those limits are suitable for personal use of M-Pesa, they make M-Pesa too inconvenient for mid-sized and larger business to use.  So they instead operate using a combination of cash + payment card (VISA/Mastercard/etc) + checking.': 3, 'The flashing mpesa logo is annoying and glitchy. ': 4, 'The "Safaricom as gatekeeper" topic was likely how the first attempt at an exchange, Kipochi Wallet, had their M-Pesa account closed about a day or two after their launch (or something to that effect).\n\nAs far as the "paper trail" issue, that has to do with being able to prove that you made a payment.   When paying a merchant that takes M-Pesa using a service called "Lipa na M-Pesa" (Swahili for pay w/M-Pesa) usually you should see an SMS text message received from M-Pesa that the payment has completed.  If that message doesn\'t arrive though there\'s no real way to know if the payment went through.  You can\'t pull a transaction statement until the next day (self-service reports aren\'t real-time).  If the merchant lets you know they did see the payment arrive they can print a receipt but that will be from their point-of-sale and that receipt likely won\'t have the transaction ID from M-Pesa, so that\'s not much help.\n\nThen if you do happen to pull a statement the next day (using Safaricom self-service), it very well might appear a complete mess.  Transactions out of order, no running balance showing after each transaction, no detail on fees, etc.   Accountants in Kenya end up losing all their hair if they are tasked with having to reconcile the M-pesa spending. \n\nSafaricom just announced that they are providing an API "real soon now" -- which will hopefully help with some of the shortcomings.\n\nAnd the large transactions -- yes definitely a problem.  The limits are that you cannot spend more than 70,000 Ksh (about $750 USD) per-transaction, you cannot spend more than 140,000 Ksh (about $1,500 USD) per-day, and you cannot receive transactions that would cause your balance to top 100,000 Ksh (about $1,100).  A business can\'t use M-Pesa as a substitute for a bank account (w/ check and debit card) with such low limits.': 4}, ('Will Ethereum replace Bitcoin?', 0): {'Probably not.
