Those companies rarely, if ever, follow the actual written policies.  The announcements of CEO\'s when posturing rarely have anything to do with actual practices and procedures.

You are not on the same page as many of venture capitalists who are pumping in money or some of the exchanges.  You are all against burdensome regulation but you diverge wildly from there when the solution is discussed.  What I hear the venture capitalists complain about is there concern over the weird notions of some of the trying to start Bitcoin companies and they are concerned these people will lose their investments due to irresponsibility.\n\nAnyone who doesn\'t agree with the extreme positions that you put forth is  "on the other side" or "promoting regulation" or a "statist" and so forth.

Fact is, my predictions turned out to be exactly correct.  Where were those calling for regulation in Califorina back then?  Wrong as well?  The people who were dead wrong about Lawsky are generally the same on who still disagree with me now.\n\nYou are also completely incorrect in how you characterize both my opinions and actions.

I don\'t know that you think the "wing nut position of the foundation" is, also, no idea what your rambling about me levying a billion dollar lawsuit is.

This, you see, along with things like name calling, is the sign of someone who has no real logical argument.  Since you and Kuhlman don\'t want to argue on logic you resort to ad hominems and dismissing all opinions other than your own as "childish", "wing nut" and painting them as if we are in some extreme bubble of delusion.   The video Kuhlman highlights includes Jefrey Tucker, Max Keiser, Peter Todd, Gavin Wood, Patrick Byrne who runs a billion dollar company and many others--  it\'s just not credible to dismiss opinions held by many people as "childish" and to assume that every one of us is against mainstream engagement.\n\nI know it\'s convenient for your world view to dismiss me as some sort of fringe extremist who won\'t engage with policy makers and who can\'t work with mainstream people.  You really should look into things a bit more and ask around about my background and the level of people I\'ve dealt with for years.\n\nJudge me on what I\'ve actually don\'t and said.

There is no way to know the facts of this and say that he "doesn\'t support any type of regulation" he absolutely does, it is a core mission, he has openly stated that he wishes this to be done in every state and has drafted roadmap  to that end -- this is very clear and not in dispute by anyone who followed the EFF\'s disagreement with his position.   \n\nApparently you are passionately arguing for him based on his speaking ability or something, without knowing even the most basic foundation of what Coincenter is actually doing.\n\nI don\'t really care if you think Jerry is more of an expert or more knowledgeable than I am.

NY should have first done a gap analysis looking at current regulations in place before doing anything.  Instead Lawsky went ahead with anew rulemaking so he could appear in the news.  He then leveraged that into a private practice.

Coin Center has essentially the same position as EFF on these issues so if you support one then you probably support the other.  EFF does little or nothing except write a few blog posts an appear at conference now and then.   Coin Center is taking an active approach to try to do something.

Any post in favour of increasing the blocksize during the full on north korea time was downvoted to oblivion and those who want to maintain this crazy low limit were upvoted. If the majority of the votes is from bots, therefore, this voting pattern should have not shifted, but it did shift and did so 100% therefore showing that the vast majority of votes are by legitimate users.\n\nNow of course there's some manipulation, by both sides I should think although I have only seen the 1mbers take blatant measures such as DDosing nodes and pools, creating hoax emails claiming to be from satoshi etc., but usually it is countered by legitimate user's voting behaviour especially when it makes it to the front page and is widely read. \n\nIt is legitimate users who are downvoting adam as any grounded interpretation of the evidence shows and their downvoting should tell him and you quite a bit about their behaviour recently in stonewalling any progress to the point now where legitimate transactions are delayed for hours. \n\nAs for consensus, everyone wants that, but we should not have one core dev or one self interested company veto progress to bitcoin's technology. That is dangerous for bitcoin itself and for those who work with bitcoin as if one person can veto then that makes that person a target for financial or physical corruption. \n\nFor example, in regards to bitcoin and if we are to entertain speculative theories, it could be said that maintaining the blocksize to 1mb turns bitcoin into a fringe tool of use only to criminals (however fairly or unfairly so defined by law) who are willing to pay the high fees in the process eradicatin it's appeal to the mainstream as no legitimate users are left, therefore making it highly vulnerable to an outright ban. \n\nNow these individuals who profess all sorts of theories may of course genuinely hold them, but everyone has a price and an entity who wished to attack bitcoin from within may be willing to pay the price and they only need to do so for one person. That is why you do not judge the person, who can easily lie, but the arguments made and trust your own judgement after analysis of the reasons provided. \n\nOr, less speculatively, Adam Back's seemingly support for the censorship policy here, being the only prominent player in the bitcoin space to do so, clearly shows that he has a financial personal interest to keep bitcoin limited and less useful so that he can provide offchain solutions which do not utilise proof of work therefore are not bitcoin.

It seems to depend on time zone more than anything, but I don't know for sure. \n\n'Plunged' is an exaggeration.

I'd say the problem only got worse after the XT sub was created and 'everybody left'. This is because they didn't leave since nobody followed them like they expected, and XT adoption flopped hard. So now we're stuck with maybe 500 people who don't want to be here, but don't have the support they thought they did as evidenced by metrics across the board (not counting vote abuse).

It is a speculative allegation given out as fact which makes him look paranoid and not grounded in reality so allowing him to dismiss the widely held view that blocks should not remain at 1mb.\n\nAs for the specific post you linked, that person clearly missed what Gavin was suggesting, that being forward-looking. As it was either a misunderstanding or an intentional conflation I do not see the harm in downvoting it so as to communicate to others that the poster is misunderstanding or intentionally misrepresenting. It is not too hard to click the plus button and I suspect that many people are actually drawn to the downvoted comments so that they can judge whether it was rightly downvoted or it was a contrarian view that they benefit from seeing.  \n\nThat is fundamentally different from outright censorship, which is what Adam's tweet seems to be supporting. Moreover, any censorship does not address vote manipulation. If this speculative and paranoid theory was correct, therefore, those downvotes should have continued during the great exodus when theymos, seemingly with your assistance, announced his censorship policy. Instead, all those who want to increase the transaction capacity and still chose to post were downvoted to hidden.\n\nThe truth of the matter is, as shown by every poll and every indication, that the vast majority of people support an increase to the transaction capacity and any downvotes, whether rightly or wrongly used, are mostly from legitimate users. That these legitimate users disagree with what Adam is saying should give him pause to think, rather than make him turn to conspiracy theories. ": 11, "Thanks.

There is no manipulation, deception, lies, censorship, or any other method employable when the truth is self evident and in the self-interest of the participants. There is no clearer truth than that the 1mb limit is far too low and must be increased. That is why 80%, if not almost everyone, supports it's increase. As the supporters are clearly the majority by any poll or indication conducted, there is no reason for them to manipulate. As blockstream is very much in the minority however, they do seem to be keen to employ every possible manipulative tactic, including the tweet in question by Adam, presumably so that they can make themselves rich with their company at the expense of technological progress, innovation, and ultimately, freedom itself. \n\nHowever, I should think they are sufficiently intelligent to realise that their profit motives conflict with those of the users and unless they come up with a reasonable proposal in Hong Kong to the form of 5mb plus 30% yearly to be implemented immediately I should think they will realize that the supermajority of users will vote them out by moving their assets.

I\'m personally pushing to ensure that\'s possible. That said, I\'m not a Bitcoin core developer, so I\'m doing my best but I expect that\'s not going to be good enough to meet the rigorous W3C standardization process. At some point, someone is going to ask if there is an implementation behind the examples used and if the answer isn\'t "Yes" (and I don\'t intend to sign my organization up for an implementation of a Bitcoin integration), then the most likely request will be to remove the examples because until there is a solid implementation, the Bitcoin examples are well-intentioned fiction.\n\nThe problem is the gap between theoretically leaving things open for Bitcoin, and ensuring that someone steps up with a working implementation against the standard that\'s being developed. We learn a great deal while doing implementations and sometimes it turns out that we didn\'t do enough in the standard to include a particular sub-technology. This is why we need experts to let us know if what we\'re doing will actually work.\n\nFor example, it\'s more clear how Bitcoin "cloud wallets" would integrate with the Web Payments work than it is how native Bitcoin wallets would integrate. So, to ensure we can do both, we\'d like to see a working demonstration of both in the Web Payments test suite. That\'s what we need from this community.

Time can only be defined in a meaningful way within one reference frame. When you have a bunch of servers communicating with each other, it's hard to make them all agree on what order events happened in. Server 1 might see A happen before B, but server 2 might see B happen before A. \n\nThe blockchain is a way to get everyone to agree on the timeline for events. In the case of Bitcoin, those events are transactions. Bitcoin makes timestamps by creating a computationally difficult math problem that takes a while to solve. Each time someone solves the math problem, the solution marks a different timestamp. Bitcoin makes a bunch of arbitrary data piggyback upon that solution, like a list of transactions and a link to the previous solution. This allows the solutions to be linked together into a chain, and allows for transactions to be put into an order that everybody can agree upon.\n\nUnfortunately, the way this computationally difficult math problem is used puts heavy constraints on what kind of problem it can be. It has to be fair to each person who tries to run it, so it has to be a cryptographically secure well-defined and well-studied problem with little or no optimization options available. It has to be able to summarize and depend on arbitrary data. It has to not change over time. And lastly, it has to be very slow to find a correct answer, but fast to verify a correct answer. All these constraints together mean that there are very few known and viable options other than the use of cryptographic hash functions like SHA256 or scrypt.

The block of approved transactions will only be accepted if it's featured in a video of someone perfectly rolling 100 dice and getting 1 on all of them.

Thus a particular scammer has ~0 chance of messing with what transactions are approved because s/he's pitted against an entire planet of dice rollers. The one who happens to get the perfect roll gets to approve that block of transactions, collect any associated fees, and get the mining reward, and everyone tries again with new blocks of transactions.\n\nThe computation in Bitcoin mining isn't figuring anything out, it's just the mathematical version of rolling these random dice over and over and over again.
