The answer: a b, a c, a d, b c,\nb d, c d.  So 6.  That's not a whole lot, but watch as things go higher: Try again for 3 words out of a 3x3 grid: 84.  4 words out of a 4x4 grid: 1,820.  By the time you get to 12:12x12: 103,619,293,824,707,388 or 1.036\\*10^17.  See also: non-repeating permutation.\n\nb) This is a little bit better.  This is a non-repeating combination.  For the 2x2 example, you now get: a b, a c, a d, b c, b d, c d, b a, c a, c b, d a, d b, d c.  So 12.  Go 3:3x3: 504.  4:4x4: 11,880.

If that were the case, the first one expands to 2.593\\*10^17, and the last one expands to 7.949\\*10^25\n\nc) Now things are getting a bit more theoretical.  Because one of your words is missing, for the given set an attacker cannot find your exact combination.  So instead it has to pull additionally from another set - say a dictionary list.  At that point you'd have to specify the size of the dictionary to figure out some exact numbers.  Suffice it to say that the numbers get a good chunk larger still.\n\nd) I didn't answer yet whether the above is even 'good enough'.  You'd have to define what is considered 'good enough'.  A human being couldn't go through those permutations/combinations particularly fast.  A computer can do things a lot faster, but still with a limit.  I have no idea how fast a computer can do a dictionary attack nowadays - not to mention that in your real world scenario of an HD wallet, there's additional overhead that slow things down considerably - but let's say it could do 1,000,000,000 attempts per second, then even approach a) would take about 103,619,293 seconds or a bit over 3 years to complete all possible options.

As a full node owner, I want those transactions or I will shut down my node, nobody is forcing me to keep it running without a miner, wallet or service behind it. \n\nEven if I don\'t gamble, maybe one day I will, or someone dear to me might. And he/she can do it safely and fairly because this wonderful technology allows this and does not censor it\'s intended purpose. You disagree with this as a miner and bitcoin user, which I don\'t understand. \n\nThank you for your explanation.': 2, "Dear PumpkinFeet\n\nThe trouble with Bitcoin is that we need consensus about political and economic issues, often in quite a specific, nuanced and complex mathematical framework and therefore any slight differences of opinion are often difficult to reconcile.\n\nFor example take interest rates in the economy, I am sure many Bitcoiners think that the government should not attempt to influence the interest rate in the economy and instead let supply and demand for credit find its own equilibrium price.  This would result in a more robust and flexible system, with a more innovative economy and efficient allocation of capital, than the current manipulated interest rate environment.\n\nHowever, we need to accept there are some circumstances where, unfortunately, it is necessary for the authorities to intervene in the market where property rights cannot be defined effectively and there are externalities.  For example in the fishing industry I advocate government quotas in some circumstances.  The ownership of fish cannot be defined due to technical limitations as the fish can swim anywhere in the sea and cannot be tracked.  Therefore without quotas, individual fisherman may maximise their own profit, overfishing could occur and then there may be insufficient fish reserves to support society, the amount of fishing would be non optimal as ordinary people can no longer eat fish.  Maybe this logic is uncomfortable, makes too many arrogant judgements about others, creates a justification for a privileged elite and violates peoples freedoms, but the facts might be such that we either have the quotas or never eat fish again.\n\nBitcoin does share some properties with this hypothetical fishing problem, the property rights of the blockchain cannot be defined for technical reasons.  Nobody owns the blockchain and it is necessary for the data to be widely replicated in order for the system to remain viable.  Without quotas on the blocksize, individual miners may maximise their own profit, too many transactions will be included in blocks and the blockchain will be too large for many people to store the blockchain and ordinary people can no longer fully participate in Bitcoin.\n\nIn addition to this, without a quota, the transaction fee would become too low to incentivise mining.   As Meni Rosenfeld brilliantly put it:\n\n>Suppose all the miners form a cartel. They will have no problem funding themselves; they can all agree not to include any tx that doesn't pay high fees. The users would pay this fee because they have no other choice.\n\n>Some users will try to pay a fee lower than the cartel's threshold. One miner decides to defect from the cartel; he includes in his block all these low-fee transactions. This costs him nothing, so this is a net profit for him (he benefits).\n\n>Seeing this, users will know that even if they don't pay the cartel's high fees, they can still get their tx included eventually. Thus, their willingness to pay high fees is lower (that is, the miner consumed their willingness). Thus, more users will try to pay low fees, and the total revenue of all miners decreases.\n\n>**But it's not just the one miner. Every miner will, individually, have an incentive to include low-fee txs. This means that even with a low fee, it's easy to get a tx to the block. Thus, no user will want to pay high fees, and the total revenue of miners will be low (this is the tragedy - for the miners, and due to the effect on network health, for all Bitcoin users).**\n\n>This is completely analogous to the classical instance of **tragedy of the commons**, where all herders would benefit if they all grazed just their fair share, but everyone is incentivized to defect and overgraze, depleting the resource and causing everyone to suffer.": 1, '> How is a message that pays fees undesired?\n\nIt isn\'t what Bitcoin was made for, and it does not have the consent of 100% of Bitcoin users (ie, full nodes).\n\n> You say you are not against gambling sites, but yet when they use Bitcoin to determine and secure proof of fairness, suddenly it becomes "spam".\n\nBitcoin does not provide secure proof of fairness.

That seems like the simplest solution in my mind that could be automated on the processors end. \n\nAnother thought I had, question really, is for wallets like electrum with their deterministic keys, it would be interesting if a user could generate a code to pass to the payor which would allow them to deterministicaly generate ONLY the public key/wallet address for the private keys that the wallet will generate. That way, for instance, rather than providing your contact with a wallet address for them to send coins to, you\'d give them the public seed, so that whenever they wanted to send coins to you, they would be sent to a new "fresh" address. \n\nObviously that\'s not feasible in this scenario, as it would require the processor and all payees to use the same wallet software, but something like that would be a huge step forward in helping providing some semblance of privacy by doing away with address reuse. Not a complete solution, of course, but just an idea. \n\nSorry, got a little off topic there. It was something that I\'ve been wondering about for some time now, and it "sort of" aligns with OP\'s question, just on a larger scale. \n\nBut for payroll processors, having them let employees provide an unlimited number of addresses rather than a single address would be the solution. Rather than store their wallet address in the "employees" table, make a related "employee wallets" table... Straight forward, only problem being if employee loses control of a private key after providing the address to the processor. ': 2, "Spam the blockchain.

If you get all the big banks together and have them agree on an alternative, its going to become a standard.
