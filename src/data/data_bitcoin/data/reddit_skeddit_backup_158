Peer review has worked quite well.\n\nI agree. \n\nHowever, this is no reason that this peer review process has to be centralized in Core\'s repo. That\'s the whole point of /u/anarchystar\'s improvement proposal. Miners and nodes can take Core\'s *recommendations* into consideration without being bound by a wall of inconvenience (self-modification of the code). Since a lot of miners already mod their code today, it is clear that all Core really does with respect to consensus parameters is *set Schelling points*^1 for consensus to form around. \n\nThe inconvenience/casual-user-difficulty of modding the code does strengthen the Schelling point, but it has the disadvantage of centralizing control over Schelling-point setting - thus introducing friction and a potential attack vector into the consensus process.\n\nToday:\n\n- Core sets the Schelling points for consensus parameters (max_blocksize=1MB, etc.) *as user-unchangeable settings*\n\n- Miners and nodes are able to mod their code to change those parameters if they wish (maybe need to hire a coder), but of course they generally don\'t as they would lose money/functionality due to not tracking consensus\n\n- Miners/nodes *could* all agree to a block where they change the parameters in sync, irrespective of Core, but it would be inconvenient (instructions for doing it would have to be circulated, etc.)\n\nWith this BIP:\n\n- Core sets the Schelling points for consensus parameters (max_blocksize=1MB, etc.) as *default settings* with alternatives selectable (with warnings)\n\n- Miners and nodes can *easily* change those parameters if they wish (don\'t need to hire a coder), but of course they generally don\'t as they would lose money/functionality due to not tracking consensus\n\n- Miners/nodes *could* all agree to a block where they change the parameters in sync, irrespective of Core, and it wouldn\'t be inconvenient (except just getting everyone on board and aware, which is the same problem faced when Core would release a hardforked upgrade)\n\nNote that all these changes are "merely" changes in convenience. I put that in quotes to be fair, because even trivial inconveniences can make a [big difference](http://lesswrong.com/lw/f1/beware_trivial_inconveniences/) in how people act. However, taking a stand against the spirit of this BIP is to fall back to the position that **Bitcoin\'s consensus is enforced by a wall of inconvenience.** \n\nIf that\'s the position you want to take, matters just got a lot worse for you: there are now implementations (and yes, they are properly called *implementations* as they don\'t force the user to break consensus) that already have this BIP partially included and are working on having it fully included, meaning that wall of inconvenience is about to get a whole lot thinner. With respect to blocksize it already has.\n\nA few days ago, in order for a miner/node running Core to adjust the blocksize cap, they had to mod the code themselves and recompile, or hire a C++ programmer familiar with Bitcoin to do it for them. Today, they can simply download a piece of software. Maybe tomorrow they\'ll be able to just download some kind of tiny plug-in someone makes.\n\nThus we see that the wall of inconvenience cannot be relied on. As is argued in the case of zero-conf transactions, "We might as well break it now because it\'s trivially defeatable." **It is inevitable that Core\'s recommended consensus parameters will become unbundled from the rest of its code offerings**, not because centralized control over the consensus parameters is bad (though I\'d argue it is), but because the inconvenience barrier cannot be maintained. \n\nWe are only now seeing this unbundling because it is only now that a sizable number of Bitcoin users have started to have a different opinion from Core and/or become wary of vesting inordinate power to set these Schelling points with a single group in a single repo. Core\'s recommendations will still carry tremendous weight in people\'s decisions about how to set their consensus parameters, but the process will no longer be centralized. People will go with Core\'s parameters if they want, or converge on one of the Core dev\'s proposals, or maybe someone else\'s. \n\nConsensus will happen, not because it is enforced by a barrier of inconvenience in Core software, but because there is overwhelming economic incentive to converge on consensus parameters. To confuse this is to imagine that the tail is wagging the dog. \n\nMoreover, the consensus will be economically rational and value-maximizing because miners and nodes are economically rational, which is a fundamental assumption for Bitcoin to work in the first place. \n\n[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focal_point_(game_theory)': 5, "Your argument is straight up false and honestly misleading.\n\nThe choice was always into the users' hands to decide what code they run.\n\nIt's one thing to promote responsibility & awareness in what software people choose to run but disingenuous to pretend features  are forced on to them.

Most of the bitcoin ecosystem will accept whatever becomes dominant as legitimate. Most users don't have strong feelings about one implementation or another, and even if they do have strong feelings, they'll still accept the dominant implementation as the legitimate bitcoin.\nThe key to legitimacy (in both a presidential election and in bitcoin) is not in achieving consensus ahead of time, but rather that most people have faith in the process.

This is a very valid concern.\n\nAlso, most big blockers do not ignore the factors that other camps emphasize. Decentralization is a key property of the Bitcoin system but it is not the only property. Decentralization is irrelevant if nobody is using the system due to it becoming unusable.\n\nTime is of the essence. Both SW and LN are unfinished solutions and the blocks are getting ever fuller. Also there has recently been increased critique to both SW and LN, making them not as clear cut solutions for all the problems as has been claimed.\n\nKey points right now in the scaling discussion for me (and I lean to the "large blocker camp") are:\n\n- The censorship (this is the #1 issue of all since discussing a compromise is well, impossible, if there is rampant censorship).\n\n- Do we need full nodes & mining to be possible in each and every country? This is a key issue. There is a lot of data that says BIP101 is completely safe in terms of being able to run a node, for certain parts of the world. For China, not so much, but do we want to limit Bitcoin\'s capacity based on the lowest denominator? I personally think not. By doing this we basically subsidize mining in China and significantly limit the capacity of the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\n- Bitcoin Core & XT and any other software forks can quite easily co-exist even in a blockchain hard fork situation. The rival software simply needs to enable the same hard fork patches to be compatible. So if XT, BU, or something else "wins" over Core, Core can simply enable the same hard fork patch and be compatible. Just like XT is currently merging soft fork updates that are initiated in Core.\n\n- Personally I\'m not super strongly for BIP101 and I don\'t think that most of the big blockers actually are. But the censorship is definitely making things much more difficult. I\'m open to a compromise solution but if one is not allowed to freely discuss the issue, it is a problem, and will turn more big blockers to directly support BIP101.\n\n- Garzik\'s BIP202 is a decent compromise.

Also, SW is significantly more developed (it exists in Elements implemented in a way that would cause a hardfork and Pieter is actively coding the softfork segwit branch in Bitcoin as we discuss [last commit was 4 hours ago]: https://github.com/sipa/bitcoin/commits/segwit). Pieter is a fucking machine when it comes to writing code, too.

I read Paul Sztorc mostly for his economic awareness, so this is a pretty big letdown. \n\n"Doubling of the money supply" is meaningless when *everyone\'s* money is doubled. What matters is the percentage of the ledger you own. If you started out owning 1 BTC out of today\'s 15M coins, you end up owning 2 BTC out of 30M coins, but you still have 1/15M of the ledger. Your purchasing power is unchanged, even though the price per coin has halved. It\'s the same as if we suddenly declared there are 24 inches in a foot and each inch is half as long as before. It doesn\'t mean you get any taller despite being double the number of inches.
