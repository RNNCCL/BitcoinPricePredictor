So if after the hardfork there is mining persisting on the original chain and there were 15M bitcoins at that point, there will then be 15M bitcoins on the original chain and 15M forkcoins on the big blocks chain.\n\nThe only caution with that is that unless you take precaution when spending coins held prior to the fork is that you can\'t spend on just one chain or the other.  So let\'s say after the hard fork the newly mined bitcoins (from the original chain) trade at $100 and newly mined forkcoins (from the big blocks chain) trade at $250.  If you then trade a pre-fork bitcoin for $100 the recipient of your transaction gets to then also spend the associated forkcoin worth $250. \n\nTo spend these independently you need to taint the coin with some newly mined (post-fork) coins.\n\nIt\'s an absolute mess.

It will probably be fine to run FSS RBF in future (when we have both large blocks and lightning), but not full RBF today.\n\n> The core devs have said publicly that the block size limit should change, although they disagree about the safety and efficacy of a change. \n\nNo, they just wanted to calm down the public. Satoshi raise the limit to 1Mb in 2010 when the code was much less optimized than it is now and the bandwidth/memory/cpu power were much more expensive.\n\nGavin tested 20Mb blocks a year ago. We could increase the block size limit at least 10-fold immediately without a problem. There is an implemented and tested solution that would work just fine.\n\nIf the core devs agreed to this solution (even starting from a 4Mb in January with future segwit development) it would be fine.\n\nBut the core developers' plan is to [continue to set the stage for non-bandwidth-increase-based scaling, while building additional tools that would make bandwidth increases safer long term](http://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2015-December/011865.html)\n\nYou know what it means? That means 1Mb blocks for months or even years (now, when we are already hitting this artificial limit!). \n\nRBF is needed to fit the most high value transactions into 1Mb blocks.\n\nThat means higher fees, delayed transactions, artificially constrained capacity.\n\nThey put on stake the future adoption of Bitcoin.": -1, "> You're missing a few years of history, I think.

Bob was dumb and he invested more than he should have, and now he doesn\'t have enough money left over to afford the engine. He decides to sell a bunch of the coins he bought from me (for $10 each) so that he can fix his car, but neither Alice nor I are interested; we both have enough coins and aren\'t comfortable with buying more... Bob has to find new buyers.\n\nBob has plenty of friends, but most of them aren\'t computer geeks, and don\'t particularly believe in Bitcoin as the evolution of money. Bob manages to convince a couple dozen of them to buy his coins from him, but the most that any of them are willing to pay is $8 per coin. Bob isn\'t happy about taking a loss, but he needs an engine, and he has coins to spare in cold storage for the long-term, so he ends up selling a bunch of coins at $8 each.\n\nNow there are 26 people using Bitcoin instead of 3 (that\'s an *exponentially growing userbase*), but the price fell from $10 to $8 (that\'s *declining prices*).

Actually I did want to convert a single key into a word list, and then separately use the private key to generate  a deterministic set of private keys. Is this possible?': 1, 'A private key is a number. That number (any number for that matter) can be turned into a bip39 wordlist just like a wordlist can be turned into a number.\n\nA wordlist is just another _base_, like base 2 is another base, or octal is another base.': 2, 'This is a really interesting question, and I\'m not an expert, but I\'ll attempt to answer.\n\nYour WIF private key is a large random number, and your defense against other people spending your coins is that it\'s (practically) impossible for people to guess this number.  The way private keys can be generated from a list of words is using hashing functions, which actually destroy information in going from input to output.  You propose some computational function that can convert a huge random number into a list of words, which we\'ll call "reverse bip39".  By definition of "secure hashing function", our "Reverse bip39" function cannot be a secure hashing function, as the act of creating the word list would require brute-forcing (trying all possible inputs to) the Reverse bip39 function. So if the hash function is secure, it would be impossible to use; and if it\'s *not* secure, then you\'ll need to keep it closed source to keep people from using your function to guess all possible inputs.\n\nSo, I guess I\'m not saying that such a function is impossible, just that it needs to be kept secret.  There\'s still the problem that your word list (or the function you\'re running it through) will need to contain at least as much information (or "entropy") as the WIF key, since any easily brute-forceable function combined with an input needs to contain all of the information necessary to reconstruct the output.  So you\'ll most likely end up with a really long word list.  I think the easiest way to solve your problem is simply creating a story out of your private key (which of course is not an "easy mnemonic"). Taking the example WIF key from the [wiki](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Wallet_import_format):\n\n5HueCGU8rMjxEXxiPuD5BDku4MkFqeZyd4dZ1jvhTVqvbTLvyTJ\n\n"(5) Harry understands entropy.  Charles Gregory Underwood 8th reads...."\n\nA more general solution to your problem could be converting the WIF key into all lowercase using base 32 or something, then inventing a cipher to convert the resulting string into words, perhaps adding a nonce and brute forcing, as in creating vanity addresses.\n\nMy favorite solution I\'ve come up with off the top of my head is creating a word array of length 2^X, like 65536 (2^16), then converting the WIF key into a byte string as described in the wiki, then chopping up the resulting byte string into pieces of maximum value 2^16, then assigning each piece to a word in your array, using the value of the current piece to find the word at that position in your array.  Write down all the words in order, each word representing 4 characters in a 74-character byte string private key.  You\'ll obviously need some padding at the beginning or end, as 74 is not divisible by 4.  This will give you a word list of length 19.  Then, when you want to recreate your private key, just run the algorithm in reverse, looking up the index of each word, which will recreate your private key.  Just don\'t lose your word list :P\n\nAll of this is, of course, a pointless intellectual exercise, as it\'s much easier to use bip39 as intended, and simply use a word list as your input.

Mr Wright discontinued the court action against Mr Ferrier in March last year.

The currency has grown in value to be worth $US5 billion.\n\nThe outing came as Australian Taxation Office officials accompanied by Australian Federal Police last week executed a warrant at Mr Wright\xe2\x80\x99s Sydney home as part of a tax dispute associated with his companies.\n\nThe acrimonious dispute with Mr Ferrier allegedly started in 2013 when Mr Wright and Mr Ferrier met at a mining conference.\n\nThe pair allegedly agreed that Mr Ferrier would procure software on his behalf from global telecommunications giant Siemens and banking software from Saudi Arabian financial institution Dallah Al-Baraka Group.\n\nMr Ferrier allegedly claimed he would be able to buy software on behalf of his mining company, MJF Mining, and share it with Mr Wright for his own development.\n\nMr Wright alleged he was then encouraged to invest in gold by Mr Ferrier, who had recently embarked with ASX-listed goldminer Paynes Find Gold. As part of the deal, the miner would provide Mr Ferrier\xe2\x80\x99s MJF with 50 per cent of the gold finds in return for providing machinery to the company. Mr Ferrier is alleged to have told Mr Wright gold was good security in the event the \xe2\x80\x9cfunny money\xe2\x80\x9d of Bitcoin failed.\n\nMr Wright has alleged payments were made in August 2013 of $38.8m \xe2\x80\x94 then the equivalent of 245,103 Bitcoin \xe2\x80\x94 for Siemens software and gold from Paynes. He then claimed payments were made to Mr Ferrier of $20.3m \xe2\x80\x94 or 135,100 Bitcoin \xe2\x80\x94 in September 2013 for the \xe2\x80\x9ccore software\xe2\x80\x9d from Al-Baraka. In September that year Mr Ferrier was arrested in Perth and the gold partnership with Paynes was discontinued.\n\nIn December 2013 Mr Wright filed actions in the Federal Court and NSW Supreme Court suing for his share of the gold, claiming the sum of $84.42m based on the market value of the alleged Bitcoin payments for the gold.\n\nThe dispute with Mr Ferrier is referenced in what is claimed to be a leaked interview transcript to Gizmodo between ATO officials and Mr Wright.\n\nIn that interview he claimed that \xe2\x80\x9cI did my best to try and hide the fact that I\xe2\x80\x99ve been running Bitcoin since 2009\xe2\x80\x9d.\n\nMr Wright was interviewed about his companies \xe2\x80\x94 which claim to have paid up shareholdings of around $300m \xe2\x80\x94 as well his alleged dealings with Mr Ferrier. \xe2\x80\x9cMy understanding was Mr Ferrier didn\xe2\x80\x99t actually want any Bitcoin.
