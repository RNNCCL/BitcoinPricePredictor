Is it really that hard?': 3, '*Urethra': -2, 'Here\'s why industry-specific regulations are almost always a bad idea, at least in the U.S.:\n\n1.  There\'s a very well-known phenomenon that happens when a government agency in the U.S. (and likely elsewhere, too) regulates an industry.  Part of this is because of the "revolving door" practice where you have the leaders of regulatory agencies and leaders of industry moving back and forth between each other\'s jobs every few years.  But a lot of it is simply because the people drawn to working for a given regulatory agency are naturally interested in the field it regulates, and so are naturally sympathetic to many industries in that field.  Either way, the end result is regulatory agencies packed with people with major sympathies toward the industry figures they are regulating.  See the Fed whistleblower for a major expose of this situation in one regulatory agency (it\'s common across the board) [1].\n\n2. Even if there were bona fide regulators in charge of their respective agencies, the problem of regulatory capture remains.  Established business in almost every highly-regulated industries use regulatory capture to keep out startups from challenging their position.  Big companies use political donations to drive regulation that is favorable toward established businesses and unfavorable toward small ones or startups.  The result is regulation that is designed *not* to protect the consumer, but regulation that is built as a wall to keep out new competitors.  We see this now in the financial industry and Bitcoin.\n\nWhat is happening here with Lawsky and Bitcoin is not some kind of aberration or exception to the rule.  *This is how regulation in our country works*.  If our population fails to catch on to this, big business and big government will continue to conspire to drive our country to third-world status.\n\nI think there should be a very thin layer of general, safety-related regulations (car seats, housing codes, fire codes, and a handful of other safety-critical areas) made at the state level by an agency of general safety regulators, and no specialized regulatory agencies.  In all other areas (particularly industries prone to fraud), consumers need to be taught how to be smarter and more discerning in the people they chose to do business with.  We\'ve become into a nation of idiots, but no amount of government regulation can save us from ourselves.\n\nFinally, let me point out that the lack of regulation in any given industry doesn\'t mean that it needs to fall prey to every scammer or lowlife around.  Lawsuits against fraudsters prosecutions should continue, but without regard to this or that microregulation in particular industries.  If you deceive people and steal their money, then you should be prosecuted for fraud.  I don\'t think that prosecutors needed any new financial regulations to prosecute pirateat40 for his pyramid scheme.  And so it goes for Moolah and (hopefully) Mt. Gox as well.\n\n1. http://www.propublica.org/article/carmen-segarras-secret-recordings-from-inside-new-york-fed ': 1, 'Here, here!': 11, "I think you and /u/eleuthria need to hug it out.

The block reward simply halves each four years until it becomes zero. Miners receive two forms of payment - the block reward and the transaction fees. The expectation is that as the block reward diminishes the transaction volume will increase and fees take over the role of compensation.

An index currency is called "money".  You cannot measure value against things with no value, and you cannot stop things of value from being traded.  An economy tends to want one money (not monopolized or forced by fiat, mind you; just that an economy is necessarily defined by it\'s common unit of account; otherwise you\'re left with barter).  The predominance of the nation state, and the force which they wield to determine the money used by the somewhat closed-off economy of that nation; is what has primarily allowed their to be many "monies" worldwide.  The evolution of economies beyond the borders of the nation-states, and the economy of the internet itself, will require a common currency (a money which defines the boundaries of the new trans-national economy).  This necessarily undermines the power and influence of the nation state.  The dollar has maintained standing as a reserve currency primarily by force, not market preference.\n\nBitcoin stands a better chance than most other commodities and altcoins to achieve the unit of account status, become money, and be that market-preferred reserve currency, in effect, for all the other currencies and modalities as Andreas calls them.': 3, 'Interesting idea: an index currency (with no value, just for the scope of showing the price of every coin): \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jw28y81s7Wo#t=1123': 4, 'The only point I might contest is using some "meta" unit as a way to determine value, because Bitcoin will be this eventually.\n\nLets cast aside current fiat/crypto exchange rates and pretend that no longer matters (ie the fiat economy imploded and crypto is all that is left).\n\nBitcoin will be the universal base currency to which all others are pegged. In effect, a crypto-reserve currency exchangeable into any other cryptocoin. Bitcoin does not exist to back any particular organization, movement, meme, whatever, but just simply is. Other coins will be very defined in their purpose as Andreas says, but always pinned to Bitcoin as a way to define a currencies value.\n\nIt is already like this on many exchanges. Typically for the alts, there is only alt/BTC pairing, not alt/alt or even alt/fiat pairing with the exception of Litecoin and a couple others. Altcoin value is already pegged to how much Bitcoin it is worth. \n\nOverall this is a good presentation that explains well why the altcoins, as dumb or scammy as many of them are, are not only never going away, but will only grow and become methods for communities to be represented through their own sovereign currency.

David Yermack and the Duke professor (I think) are the only two finance professors in the U.S. that are really focusing on bitcoin right now, and I wouldn't be surprised if Geoffery Miller is one of the only Law professors focused on Bitcoin as money rather than Bitcoin as a crime tool.  Prof. Miller does work on financial institutions, where Bitcoin is a hot topic more in white collar crime than in banking circles right now (partly since banks don't touch it).\n\nProf. Miller thinks bitcoin is very innovative and could very well become a large-scale currency. From a lawyer's perspective, Bitcoin works as well as anything else.\n\nProf. Yermack thinks Bitcoin is fascinating and wants it to succeed, but is very skeptical it will because of a few factors:\n\n* Transaction Volume - he thinks it should be increasing exponentially if it were to catch on\n\n* Gender and Age disparity in use - He thinks that it if the disparity means that women and the elderly are turned off to Bitcoin, it won't succeed.\n\n* The 10 minute block mining time. I think he doesn't trust verifications that come in before the block is actually mined. He is under the impression that if he buys a coffee the merchant needs to wait 10 minutes to be sure she got her money.\n\n* The transactions per second cap. It's around 7? for Bitcoin and in the 100s of thousands for Visa and Mastercard.\n\n* He's worried that someone (like a terrorist state) can invest only a few hundred million and launch a 51% attack and destroy the entire currency.\n\nBoth professors kind of think that eventually, if Bitcoin takes off, the protocol will inevitably be changed to become inflationary. Which is interesting. They think that the Bitcoin issuance cap would be a problem, if they weren't certain that it would be removed upon wide-scale adoption.\n\nThey also both think that Alt-coins are basically irrelevant.

There's no press covering cryptocurrencies in Norway unfortunately, and the traditional media that has given it some coverage, the coverage has been very poor. The reason for this is that the journalists are not really interested in, and does not really understand bitcoin.\n\nForbes had Matonis who very eloquently and sharply wrote about bitcoin and everything related, he later went on to be involved with The Bitcoin Foundation, and recently quite and will most likely work in the bitcoin pricate sector, however, I digress.\n\nFirst of all - please protect yourself. In Norway, you could easily come on a list of 'no good persons' internally in a bank, and it's not unthinkable that your requests will be relayed to other state departments in Norway, so in the event you would need a bank loan in the future, you could be on a 'no good' list internally at that bank. You could laugh at this paranoid conspiracy statement, but do you really want to risk it?\n\nIt's important to understand that the banks rule Norway. Not the politicians. It's the ones with the most power that is silently deciding the agenda. The banks are in business only to turn a profit. That's their main goal. They're not interested in helping people. That's why you can se numerous stories about the average man and woman being fucked over by banks in Norway.\n\nFees are often very high, even for services that ideally should be feeless. When you send an e-mail to a bank, the one you speak with is the customer representative. What these representatives say might vary wildly and might not even be the official stance of the bank. As for doing bitcoin business with a Norwegian bank, you might get positive responses from customer reps, and even from mid-level management, but usually it's the upper management that kills your business, very often citing completely vague reasons like money laundering, terrorist financing, hacking and so on, while in reality, many of these banks are engaging in greyzone and non-legal activities themselves. The only way they can get away with it, is because it's covert and they have hired bright minds to conceal all their shady dealings in difficult legalese. Home owners and bank account holders are exploited en masse, but they don't gather in protest. Why do you think the main banks are so slow with changes in the rates? It's all about the incentive, and for banks - money is the only incentive.\n\nState departments in Norway is know for their incompetency, and the banking sector is no different, but there's one thing they're impressively good at, and that is to extract money from their inhabitants.\n\nSince banks are in the business to make more money, any query or question that does not add to this, is largely seen as uninteresting, so it gets dismissed already at the first level of customer support, or the customer support representative have never heard about this thing called bitcoin, so out of fear or confusion, he just ignores it, I would also think some of it is forwarded higher up in the organization, but since the days are busy, and this is not something that really adds to their profitability, and in addition its a very complicated subject, so it's much easier just to ignore it, and go on with the things that actually increases the bottom line for the bank. If you'd asked for information about getting a loan, the answer percentage would probably be much higher, alsocalling them would be better, as they could not simply ignore you once on the phone, most people would be uneasy about doing that, even employees in a bank. Better yet, would be meeting them in person, preferably someone higher up in their organization, but that again costs a lot of money and time, and will most likely not give any positive outcome anyway.\n\nDon't expect a bank to be honest and just, they do only what benefits their business, and although bitcoin is something very new and promising, and they should not dismiss it, don't expect them to take it seriously at this point.\n\n": 3, "Yeah could be, I'm not sure though...": 1, 'The question this raises in my mind is who do we work with to change this behavior.': 2, 'In an [article on TEK](http://www.tek.no/artikler/norges-storste-bank-avviser-bitcoin-nekt-forelopig/165019) (a Norwegian technology magazine) ([Google Translate](https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&tl=en&js=y&prev=_t&hl=en&ie=UTF-8&u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.tek.no%2Fartikler%2Fnorges-storste-bank-avviser-bitcoin-nekt-forelopig%2F165019&edit-text=)) DNB says the following:\n\n> Informasjonsdirekt\xc3\xb8r Even Westerveld i DNB avviser p\xc3\xa5 sin side at banken per i dag har noen retningslinjer om \xc3\xa5 ikke ha bitcoinselskaper som kunder, men at dette er under vurdering. \n\n> -Vi er imidlertid \xc3\xa5pne om at det er stadig flere banker som sier nei til transaksjoner knyttet til digitale valutaer, og at DNB som del av v\xc3\xa5rt internasjonale samarbeid mot hvitvasking og \xc3\xb8konomisk kriminalitet, ogs\xc3\xa5 vurderer v\xc3\xa5r policy knyttet til dette, skriver Westerveld i en e-post til Tek.no.\n\nTranslated to English:\n\n> Information Director (PR Director) Even Westerveld in DNB rejects on his side that the bank today has any policy of rejecting bitcoin-businesses as customers, but that it is currently under consideration.\n\n> -We are however open about the fact that an increasing amount of banks are saying no to transactions related to digital currencies, and that DNB as part of their international cooperation against money laundering and economic criminality, are also considering our policy connected to this [digital currency], Westerveld writes in an email to Tek.no\n\nSo, they are not directly stating they are not allowing bitcoin/digital currency businesses, but that they are considering their policy regarding it. I think a lot is being said between the lines here, especially when their policies and international cooperation against money laundering and economic criminality is mentioned in the context of Bitcoin.\n\nSo, maybe DNB is playing a PR-game to avoid bad press?

I just don't think it is 100% correct. I'm pretty sure that there are nuances in this that can explain why it is the way it is.\n\nAs a geek, I would love to know more about how this work in practice.

You write a good text in general, but some of it may come as conspiracytheoretics.": 1, "Part 2/4\n\nPerhaps if thousands of the alleged customers of justcoin teamed up, and took a tour of allt he banks, they would start seeing that something is really going on here. All could wear a t-shirt saying. I'm a part of the new paradigm, the block chain, a decentralized payment system, or something shorter and more suitable. Then just quietly go around to all the banks, visit their main branches, and fill up all their space with all these people with all these shirts, say nothing at all, perhaps just list a web-address on the t-shirt, where anyone that is interested could go and get more information.\n\nE-mail has a very low status in the Norwegian society, and this society is very conservative, and you have to act in a political correct way, not to be a stranger. Sadly, most Norwegian people are very passive, and will not engage in anything, unless of course there was some serious crisis, but there are none, there's too much money and wealth in the last-soviet state of Norway.\n\nAfter the Breivik incident, there was a big appearance of all kinds of people wanting to show their support and love. But nothing has changed after this, the society has only gotten worse, with the Terror-paranoia that recently took place this last summer topping it off, where the govt spent millions and millions of NOK on raising security, based on completely vague reports of possible terror. At the same time, people die in droves on roads, in hospitals, from overdoses, other kind of accidents and some are outright destroyed by hostile actions by the Norwegian Govt.\n\nIt would not be far fetched to think it's all part of an elaborate plan to increase the grip and control over Norwegian society, and creating a police state. However, most inhabitants have such a comfortable life, and is more interested in knowing whether Liverpool beat Manchester United last weekend, than to care about the most important issues that this country is facing.\n\nSince the oil age will come to an end, and the excessive immigration is slowly shifting the population from mostly ethnic Norwegians to a mixed group where foreigners are plentiful, the future does not look bright. A lot of the immigrants depends on aid from the government, and the oil fund will run out quickly with the current welfare state system. Also criminality is rampant, and even simply cases with a known perpetrator is often dismissed, to the frustration of ordinary citizens, but in cases were the state stand to lose any kind of substantial money, they will put in very strong forces. \n\nThe Norwegian state along with the banks are in reality a coalition that wants to extract as much wealth from the population as they possibly can. In the old ages, there was kings, the aristocracy and the common man who had to slave on their land to pay taxes, today we have the politicians and the bureaucrats, and the common man who's still a slave to the government and the banks.": 4, 'Maby this can help you to understand how banking works, at least in the US: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFDe5kUUyT0': 1, "Part 4/4\n\nMost Norwegian bureaucrats are brainwashed drones, with the inability to think for themselves, and they do not have any kind of vision for the future whatsoever, if something's outside their script, it must be bad - really really bad - so it's better not to deal with it, or to hamper it's progress.\n\nWhat most humans in Norway fail to realize is that Bitcoin in itself is a neutral technology that will give man freedom, as opposed to the oppression that's done by the Norwegian state. Did you know that your bank accounts is not an agreement between you and the bank? Your bank account, is the property of the bank, and by extension the government. At any point, it could be blocked, if they chose to block it. And just as bad, police agencies, border agents and other law officers have a direct link to access information in your bank account at will.\n\nRecently lots of men that came with a plane from Thailand were stopped at Gardermoen, and interviewed by the police, because the police wanted to run a campaign to deter child abuse. Most, if not all of these men were completely innocent, while a minority might travel to thailand to exploit children, most thailand tourists go there for the sun, the nice weather and friendly people. Norway have a lot to learn from the attitude of people from Thailand. Most people in Norway is very grumpy, but seldom talk about the reason for their bad temper, so the perfect combinations are cold winters, grumpy bureaucrats, and then you come and ask them about bitcoins. Just perfect. You are such a terrorist, and surely you must do terrorist financing!\n\nThe main problem is that in Norway a model of unsustainability has been built. The welfare state as we know it, cannot continue to exist in the future. And also the government at large has a blanket card to spend money in every way they see fit themselves, there's absolutely no accountability and transparency. And if you demand to look into such cases, your name will be noted in several registers, and the communication might as well be put online without your approval in their electronic system, where anyone can ask for permission to see what you wrote. So again, protect yourself, use a fake name, VPN/TOR and an anonymous e-mail account when discussing sensitive or difficult matters with government officials over e-mail, if you ever get an answer - that is.\n\nThere's only one matter the Norwegian Government and the banks takes seriously, and that's money. Your health, well being and respect towards you as a single individual is non existent. You're part of the masses, the cow, that the establishment is milking for all its worth, you're just a number. You died of poor health treatment, ah - no worries, the routines will be looked into.\n\nAlso, the culture in state departments in Norway is that of fear. They often claim openness, transparency and democracy to appear political correct outwards, but if you raise your voice repeatedly against wrongdoings, don't be surprised when your promotion is dismissed silently and you get evasive explanations for why it is so. Don't ever criticize your bosses, as they're omnipotent and always right, even when they're wrong,and then you shall rise to become a star in your department, or your party.\n\nIt's all about knowing the right people, not about trying to create a society where common sense, rationality and facts rules.\n\nIf you're involved with Bitcoin, you're threading out of the box, and you become an enemy of the establishment. People will not understand you, people will ridicule and ignore you, but those believing in blockchain technology will march on undeterred.\n\nIn short, the Norwegian govt DOES NOT see bitcoin as an opportunity, and WILL NOT embrace it, rather they have dedicated task forces looking into this socalled threat. Not to help entrepreneurs and individuals succeed, and together create a great society, but to preserve the status quo. Perhaps bitcoiners should fight back and start making individual files on those individuals in the Govt and banks actively working against Bitcoiners? But that would be rather silly to spend our time on such issues.\n\nNorway has a lot of intelligent inhabitants, and many of them are starting to see through the bullshit the government is serving us, but we still do not stand united.\n\nIf the government was smart, they'd say that all bitcoin companies in Norway are legal, and you pay a flat 10% tax, and that's it. End of story.\n\nCrime and nefarious dealings is something that's part of the character of a criminal, and in many cases, what's a crime and what's not a crime is something that the government defines. Previously it was a crime to participate in a poker game where money was involved in Norway, and police used to raid such events. This might change, so in essence what's law today, might not be the law tomorrow. And the law might not at all be right.\n\nThe government has the lawful ability to tax you in every which way, an in total you end up in paying most of your money in various taxes and expenses to the government. Government on their side has no responsibility to use these funds wisely, there's many cases of extreme overspending of taxpayers money, this never has any consequence for the state. The state officials overspending so severely, would they overspend their own private funds? I highly doubt it. Often the money should also be followed, as corruption is not something that's unheard of in Norway, however even mentioning it, makes everybody turn they back on you. Lots of bureaucrats have connections in the private sector, and that way lots of contracts are made, and more often than not, big projects are rigged in terms of financing where bureaucrats give work to friends companies. There's been a lot of official scandals, but this is only the top of the iceberg. In addition you have some secret and informal societies and networks where bankers and govt officials mingle to establish strategies that will ensure their continued stronghold in Norwegian society.\n\nAll in all, bitcoin does not fit into this agenda. And that's the main problem. Anyone entering the bitcoin industry heavily in Norway (is there really one?) must expect to take a very hard beating, and will most likely not succeed. Jailtime, legal battles, fines and shutdown of their business might be possible outcomes.\n\nI'm not saying this to be negative, just to be realistic about the current climate for bitcoin in Norway. However, the state machine in Norway is very inefficient, so depending on what kind of bitcoin business you engage in, you might go under the radar, and even not be affected, however once you make a bridge between bitcoin and the current financial system, you might be in for a surprise.\n\nPerhaps the best idea would be to in the biggest cities to arrange for Satoshi-corner. That is a place in the city where people can meet and exchange bitcoin and fiat currencies, and perhaps have a good talk about it. Using cash, the banks would have no say in this, and you could have a beer and a pizza with a fellow bitcoiner as well..\n\nWhatever you do, if you have an important relationship with a bank, do not conduct any bitcoin business through that bank, as the bank might as well decide to close all of your accounts, including your home mortgage. If you want to do bitcoin trade, make an account in a separate bank.\n\nIt really is a shame to live in the socalled modern world with  conditions like this. All govt. employees that are involved in profiling bitcoin actors, should be incredibly ashamed of themselves. Likewise, every upstuck, conservative banker who dismisses bitcoin without actually even looking into what it is, shame on you as well. You're not creating a better world, the only thing you do is to enrich yourself and your peers, while feeding off the population. A common word for such creatures are vultures and parasites.\n\nThe establishment will continue to exist as long as the inhabitants do nothing, the iron grip will continue to be strengthened until we can no longer breathe.\n\nThe world hails Norway, it's about time the truth comes out about what Norway really is. But of course, those who has anything negative to say about the status quo in Norway, is shunned and considered outcasts. \n\nThe question is, what can we do about this?": 3, 'We are customers of several banks in norway and have never gotten any feedback that our business is a problem.  They meen the banks can not trade Bitcoin, but companies that are customers of the bank can. \n\nRegards Bitcoinsnorway.com': -2, "Yes, of course. If you haven't already, try involve yourself with governmental officials in Norway, they break their own laws on a daily basis, and there's no culture for actually helping inhabitants that has legitimate concerns. If you are of the opinion that Norwegian banks have 100% of the money they're lending out, please refer me to that source, it would be an interesting read. Why do you think there's a requirement of 5 milions EURO's to even start a bank in Norway? It would not perhaps be the fact that it is to prevent small entrepeneurs from entering the market, ie. preserve the power and control where it currently exists. I have absolutely no issue being called names, but please if there's something that you think's outright wrong, an elaborative response would be welcomed.": 1, "3/4\n\nAnother interesting question you could ask the banks would be how they create money for the loans they give out for people wanting to purchase a home. It seems like the banks do not have the money that they're lending out, but rather create this out of thin air, on a promise that you will pay back, slaving in your job for years and years, because you need to pay down that expensive house of yours. 20-30 years of your life is spent in slavery before you finally have paid down your house. And all of this is the accepted social norm in Norway, so nobody really questions it. You have to go to school, then get a job, then get a house and a family, and you should not concern yourself with anything that you have no business concerning yourself with, for example government affairs and the affairs of the banks. They want to keep the control among the rich and powerful. And they will do this at any cost. Don't mess with the wrong people.\n\nAccording to Occam's Razor it's most likely that banks in Norway at this point mostly is in the ignore stage, and my guess is that anyone that really wants to challenge the status quo should have really deep pockets, and be willing to go all the way, putting their own life in the line, that's how serious this financial business is.\n\nInstead of embracing new technology, Norway is known to be slow adapters, esp. at a state level. Norway could've been number one on digital currencies, the leading country on earth in this field. It could create a lot of jobs and innovation. But unfortunately, because of the extreme conservatism and the existing power structures in Norway, anyone wanting to go into this industry needs to have balls of steel, and most likely must expect to fail hard, not because they don't work hard and are honest, but because if they don't fail by themselves, they will fail because of the rigged game that the Norwegian establishment represents. If there's no substantial money laundering going on, a case will be constructed, and there will be lengthy and expensive legal battles, all the while the business will be unable to operate with the bank accounts with the banks.\n\nBetter than trying to force the old system to learn new tricks, is to spread the word about bitcoin, and have merchants adopt it, for instance anyone with a camping ground could offer campers to pay in bitcoin, and then subsequently, they could order merchandise from abroad, circumventing the Norwegian system entirely. The camping place owner could also buy groceries from a nearby farmer with bitcoins, and the farmer could then again pay for car repairs at a local car repair shop. That way, we'd be participants in the new system, that bitcoin represents, and we would be free individuals, not being spied on and controlled by the government and the banks.\n\nThe government do not trust you, so why should you trust them? By default, in Norway you're considered a criminal, and the police and other officials will do whatever they feel like towards your person, your property and your business in the event of any kind of suspicion. If you haven't already experienced this in your life, and you live in Norway, you've been lucky, and you've probably not pushed the envelope, like most Norwegians never do. Once you start pushing the envelope, even if you're polite, respectful and professional in your communication, you will start creating enemies. The elaborate bureaucracy has an incentive to uphold its own existence, and where a case could be solved by a single official using common sense, more often than not, even simple cases are turned into elaborate bureaucratic back-and forth games.\n\nThe press in Norway receives state support for a large part, and thus the media organizations if not already owned by powerful entities that dictate their daily agenda, has no interest of digging deep and really expose what power structures really exist. This could be dangerous, and would quickly lead to a journalist losing his job.\n\nIt's much safer to just copy paste whatever he finds on the internet, make his assigned number of articles a day, get his paycheck so he can sustain himself. Talking against the status quo is very dangerous, and there's no reward for you, as you cannot criticize any high level official in Norway, without creating very powerful enemies. Those people have lots of resources, and will do the out-most to destroy you and your life.\n\nThere's a lot of talk of openness, democracy and so on, but in reality, once you start digging deep enough, those issues no longer apply. Bitcoin does not belong in the world of the status quo, if it ever is to take on on a large scale, it will only happen if some big organization with lots of money, like coinbase or similar enters the market, and then there will be very elaborate AML and KYC requirements, any small time company or trader, once becoming large enough will be shut down.\n\nDo not be surprised if bitcoin at one point becomes outlawed in Norway as well. It's completely typical in Norway to focus on each and every negative aspect of something new, instead of actually embracing the new technology and help it grow, and become something great.\n\nPlease be advised that the Skattetaten in Norway, or the Norwegian equivalent of the IRS has assembled a task group that's profiling the bitcoin actors in Norway. That says everything there's to say about the attitude that the current establishment in Norway has towards bitcoin.\n\nThere's always a lot of talk about money laundering, tax evasion, drug trade, hacking, even hitman hiring when it comes to bitcoin. What all these humans fails to comprehend, and perhaps it's because they do not quite understand this new technology, so they put forth the worst possible scenarios they can imagine, to avoid dealing with it altogether, and it's not so strange as most humans simply does not have the brain and intelligence to comprehend something so complicated as blockchain technology, and much less being able to have the vision to foresee what this will do for the world in the coming years.\n": 3, "No offence taken at all. I would've loved to learn any detail about this as possible as well, but I don't know if that info is even accessible to non-insiders of the banks, and the info we would get, would it be truthful? From what I've learned banks don't need to have more than 10% of the money they're lending you, and the rest is created in a process in the bank when you apply for the loan, and that money is backed by your promise to pay it back, and if it cannot be paid back, the collateral (house) will be sold, and if that does not cover it, the back's facing a loss. But as long as the money in the first place did not exist(?) how can it in reality be a loss?\n\nIn old times, the gold smiths kept gold in their vaults, and then they quickly figured that most people would be happy if they got a note saying how much gold they held, and then the same gold smiths quickly discovered that most people would never ask to actually get their gold, so then the gold smiths could issue certificates for more gold than they actually had. Actually some gold smiths was hanged because of this.\n\nThen the bankers continued the practise, and by lobbying the government, the made it into law that they could create money out of thin air. So to the best of my understanding, the money you're paying your house with, comes largely from a loan that's created in the bank, backed by debt, and all the bank needs to do is to sit around for 20-30 years and wait for you to pay back, with interest, while you have to work hard in a job to be able to pay it off. All they did was to have a very expensive banking license and to create some money out of thin air.\n\nIf I'm mistaken, please correct me, and I would love to learn more about this. I'm not interested in pursuing any confirmation bias, but at the same time I must also be sceptical of any sources.\n\nMost people never reflects on what money is, and how it is created, most people just use it.\n\nPerhaps we should send e-mails to various institutions and banks and ask them to clarify these issues, I wonder if we'd get honest answers, and if it was possible to actually visit  a bank and monitor the entire process with our own eyes.": 1}, ('TIL: even gold isn\'t backed by gold!

You seem to be in the camp that believes that the rules have a literal interpretation and should be enforced in a hard-line manner. Unfortunately we don\'t have mods like that, because the people that originally created this sub have strong anarchistic and libertarian ideologies, they generally have a light hand when it comes to enforcing these rules, and are more seen as guidelines in some cases. This is good because it means that mods let the sub and it\'s participants rant, bicker, and everyone\'s opinion can get aired without fear of reprisal. This also means there are those that will push the tolerances of even hardened redditors and as a result we often get low quality posts, obvious trolling, and it can sometimes create an air of hostility and also produce and echo-chamber effect (AKA circlejerking), but trolls also get their say too and in some circumstances their opinion helps to snap people out of the echo chamber effect. \n\nBottom line is, if the people hated this sub, they\'d go to one with nanny-like rules, lord knows there is nothing stopping anyone from creating a new sub to mod themselves.

Trying to filter posts according to a strict interpretation of the subs rules is silly.

The genesis block is after all seeded by The Times front page article on 1/3/2009 titled "Chancellor on Brink of Second Bailout for Banks". Saying fiat events is off topic is like saying the price is off topic, or saying that the currency aspect is irrelevant and we should only be allowing discussion of the blockchain tech, or that announcements of another business adopting Bitcoin transactions is clogging the front page. The reality is all these things are interrelated and intertwined.

We believe that the best solution for problems in the music industry is to reinvigorate the relationship between Artists and Fans, and this is best done by acknowledging the key role fans can play for Artists, and to reward them for this.\n\nA 90% royalty of a track that only a few fans buy is not as lucrative for an Artist as a 50% or 40% royalty that is driven by the purchases of many fans who are sharing in that Artist's increasing fame and success.": 1, 'And... you may not see your percentage for a while.

": 2, "As far as we can tell, peertracks is essentially another alt-coin. We don't believe that this kind of alt-coin is the right way to go, because they are typically not created with scarcity in mind (unlike Bitcoin). Which means, many people will be buying into something that will never appreciate in value, and even if 'whatever coin' is in demand, the buyer has to find someone else to trade it to, to be able to recoup anything. \n\nAlso, collectively, all these alt-coins will be subject to 'power law' distributions, (some might be popular, but many not). So, its easy to see that over time, inequity and loss will be common, and successes more and more scarce in relative terms.\n\nWe thought very hard about supporting different alt-coins as well as Bitcoin in Bittunes, but over time we realized that with all the fragmentation going on in this space, it was more important than ever to stay with Bitcoin only.

The first was allowing unregulated copyright encumbered music to be shared, triggering the inevitable shit storm of law suits from the Record labels and Movie industry, (this ended up crippling the movement).\n\nSecondly, there was always a massive problem with 'free riding' because there was inherently little or no incentive for users to upload music on these platforms. In fact there was a disincentive, because it was uploading that became the crime as far as copyright 'Piracy' was concerned. So we had too many downloaders and not enough uploaders, so the systems never achieved proper health. \n\nTo fix these problems, and to fix P2P file sharing, we need to make sure that no 'illegal' music is shared, and this should be do-able, because there is a massive amount of great independent music being made that needs to be discovered, and the creators own 100% of the rights, so there should be no problem. (we will also develop systems to allow appropriate rights splits for Indie Record Label content soon).\n\nWe also need to incentivise uploaders, and what better way is there to do that than allowing them to earn money by being the distribution channel. This is kind of 'payment for services rendered', because these uploaders have the cost in bandwidth etc, so they should be reimbursed. \n\nSo.. in the end, why we have created a split in percentages of royalties primarily between Artists and Fans, is because this is the key and most meaningful partnership.

Modern methods of payment have expanded beyond the typical cash or credit card transactions.Bitcoin, a digital currency (Also called cryptocurrency), has gained massive media attention recently as the number of businesses has expanded to accept Bitcoins for payment.Long before the introduction of digital currencies, various businesses have created points models that reward consumers with points for completion of various tasks such as spending a certain dollar amount, or even by purchasing points with dollars.These point systems effectively operate as currency allowing the consumers to buy a retail item or pay for some type of service.Many communities across the United States and in California have created "community currencies" that are created by members of a community in conjunction with merchants who agree to accept the alternative currency.These "community currencies" are created for a variety of reasons, some of which include encouraging consumers to shop at small businesses within the community or increasing neighborhood cohesiveness. "Community currency" has also become a form of political protest as some communities that use such currency do so in protest of United States monetary policies, or large financial institutions.': 2, "I guess I'm confused as to the significance of this.
