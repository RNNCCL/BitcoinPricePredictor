Any idea how computationally expensive it would be to actually implement the MPC with say 10 non-colluding vote counters and say 100 million ballot submissions?\n\nGiven the requirement for plausible deniability of your vote it seems like a good idea despite the possible inefficiency. If you were willing to loosen that requirement you could do it in a much simpler way where you do not need to rely on MPC or non-collusion (other than to generate the initial list of public identities that are allowed to vote in the election, assuming you want to use a one person one vote scheme rather than stake-based voting). Anyone could independently calculate the votes by looking them up in the public blockchain (you would still have voting privacy, assuming you were using something like Tor to actually submit the ballots to the network in order to protect any attackers that may want to associate your vote to your identity via your IP address).\n\nPersonally, I don\'t care if people want to sell their vote at what they think is a fair market price (IMO it is their vote to use as they wish including voting randomly or selling to the highest bidder). I think there are easier ways for rich parties to manipulate election results (propaganda campaigns, ads) rather than directly buying votes which would probably be economically inefficient for them. The only remaining issue is extortion or social pressures. You can design the clients so that you erase your randomly generated private key that let\'s you verify that your vote was properly counted in the blockchain (and thus later in the actual results). One could then plausibly claim that they "erased their private key after voting even before the election ended" (whether it is true or not), and therefore are "unable to prove that I voted [the way they claim they voted]". Also, hopefully we would be living in a society where asking people to prove how they voted would be a social taboo and if they try to extort you to prove how you voted that would already be illegal. I personally think this is good enough.\n\nBut it is nice to know that a solution theoretically exists that can provide much better plausible deniability and privacy properties for online voting at the cost of trusting the vote counters to not all collude together (which seems reasonable) and also possibly larger inefficiency.

That's part of the reason it is so important to use an HD wallet that never reuses addresses. Even if the Stingray does capture a transaction or two off your phone, it can't take that little bit of information and figure out exactly which other coins you've spent or may have. They can trace the route that all the coins took before eventually arriving at a wallet you control, but unless they capture you spending money from other addresses, they can't necessarily identify you as the ultimate source for the BTC.\n\nIn other words, every time you spend BTC, the balance you want to send goes to the recipient's address, but the extra amount in the source set of funds you're spending (the unspent outputs) are sent to another brand new address. If someone only captures one transaction from you sending BTC from one address to two new ones, it's very difficult to tell which one is the amount you intended to send to someone else and which is the leftover balance you wanted to keep in a different, new address. That is unless and until they capture another transaction from you sending BTC out from one of the two addresses that received BTC from your first transaction.

More people more lost coins? \n\nQuestion: What does verifying the total available gold allow you to do? What is possible for you to verify 'anything' exists? How many apples are there? Red bricks? Can you verify how many airplanes exist?\n\n2.) What should a STORE of value do? We need to eat, so beef wouldn't be a good store of value right? What are you trying to say? Not being able to counterfeit, scientific application, and store of value are things gold 'does' well. They still talk about gold daily on the markets. Again what do you want your store of value to 'do'? What exactly happens that makes gold not function as it does today?\n\n3.) Okay. I agree. If everyone used gold, there wouldn't be many big piles of it making it hard to steal a lot of it at once. We store value in it instead and protect it. That does cost currency. I have to protect my data(value-work-effort) every once in a while by buying new hard drives (store of value). Sometimes security costs.

Of course, in this case, if its a digital currency, we could remove bitcoins from the system in various ways, like removing fractions of every bitcoin. IE, every bitcoin is suddenly now equal to .98% of its original value, and 1 mBTC would buy 1 apple again.\n\nWhile I do agree that tieing a currency to something like gold is pointless and arbitrary, it might be a battle worth fighting if you replace gold with a basket of everyday goods most people have to buy. \n\n": 1, '>IE, every month, your rent costs 100 BTC.

This year, your rent is 100 cell phone months; maybe in five years with more mobile network buildout, your rent would be 200 cell phone months.\n\nYou have to evaluate inflation against a basket of goods, and that\'s an inherently averaging process, and unless everyone is exactly average, everyone will actually experience a slightly different inflation rate. Even if you applied monetary policy in a tight feedback loop where the average (over all consumers) basket\'s price is the same over years, *some* people will experience rising prices (as oil gets harder to get at, information easier) because they use more oil than average, and others will experience declining prices because they use more information than average.': 1, "Hrmmm, what's an example of a gold-based currency, that actually tracks the value of gold?\n": 1, 'Yes, it is possible to make an inflation-resistant currency. \n\nThe gold standard (supposed to be both inflation resistant) worked that way from the late 19th century until World War I or the Great Depression, depending on where you look and who you ask. Countries printed paper currency based on a ratio of gold in reserve at their central banks. In the United States, where gold was valued at $20 per ounce, 20 dollars were printed for every ounce that the Federal Reserve had in its vaults.\n\nThis system fell apart because of what made it good in the first place - the ease of movement of money across borders. Things went kaput in the US, and so people started moving gold out of the US to other places. The US didn\'t like that (because its dollar to gold ratio is now out of whack), so the Fed hiked interest rates (paying banks interest to re-deposit their gold in its vaults). Its only other alternative would have been to go around buying dollars with gold in order to get the dollar-gold ratio back to where it was supposed to. However, that is expensive, and could only be done for a small period of time. It\'s also quite terrible for economic growth. In any event, when the Fed hiked rates, other countries followed, because they wanted the gold too. The result was gold sloshing around the globe to whomever paid the most for it at the time, causing massive instability, countries hiking barriers to slow the movement of gold across borders, and eventually resulted in most countries either abandoning gold or devaluing their currency.\n\nThe gold standard was reinvented after WWII but fell apart for similar reasons. The US hit a bad patch, the Fed didn\'t want to blow all of its gold defending a largely-arbitrary peg, and the market price of gold as a commodity had gotten completely divergent from the $35 an ounce official dollar-gold rate.\n\nFor some reason this history is always forgotten by goldbugs who think gold was the greatest basis for a currency ever. But, to answer your other question:\n\nCould you make the supply of bitcoin track a CPI? Sure, probably, at least for rate of increase. Many central banks today base their policy on CPI increase / decrease, although which type of CPI they use and which parts they emphasize over others varies from bank to bank. Energy prices, for example, are sometimes (but not always) stripped out of CPI calculations that rely more on the "staples" - bread, milk, that kind of thing. So you\'d need to pick how you want to compute CPI. The other wrinkle is that, if you\'re using a fiat currency to price things, there would be a natural inflation due to conventional monetary policy tolerance of ~2% inflation year on year.\n\nWith bitcoin, should CPI fall into deflationary territory (prices are shrinking year to year), there would be no way to remove bitcoins from the system. So you would never have a "neutral" money, just one that doesn\'t inflate. It would definitely deflate over time.
