(A Reuters article claims that most Blockchain.Info wallets are empty, which indirectly supports my estimate about the blockchain traffic.)\n\nCurrently, those fake transactions are free, because the cost of the network is not paid by those who move the coins, but by those who buy coins to save them.  When the network starts to demand fees to cover its costs, most of that fake traffic will disappear. To sustain the network as it is now, with fees paid by 10% of the current blockchain traffic, each transaction would have to pay 120 USD, on average.\n\nIf the fees were to be set to a percentage of the transaction\'s total output, then the miners would have to skim off the current cost of the network (~1.2 million USD/day) from 10% of todays daily volume (which is ~80 million USD/day now).

This tech is useful to ensure no database corruption occurs in a robust way.  It\'s not that difficult to set up and will certainly be used by others for securing very valuable information.  The issue is you need enough people wanting to mine (or paying them to mine) to keep it secure.  If they split off from bitcoins and essentially create their own alt coin they\'ll need to offer an incentive to miners as to why they should want to mine.   \n\n"The blockchain", i.e. the Bitcoin blockchain is vastly more useful IMHO.  \nIt is the most secure database in the world that everyone has access to.  This has vastly profound implications for the financial world and in time as they learn to use it will become more and more the norm for anything time or content sensitive.\n\nThis can certainly be used by financial institutions and in particular the contracts approach like coloured coins, counterparty and the likes show how the blockchain can be used as the backbone for other facilities without using bitcoins at face value.  It\'s secured by the Bitcoin protocol and uses bitcoin to pay for the transaction fees and nominal values used to transfer ownership but they are considered as tokens with potentially vastly more value than their fungible market value.  E.g. a 0.000001 bitcoin may represent a share in a company or someone\'s house.  This is where I see a lot of disruption for the financial sector as it make issuing and trading shares vastly cheaper, easier and 24/7.  \n\n\nThat said, this technology still requires the bitcoin/tokens so they will need to use some bitcoin (could be cents) but it still uses them. If someone used the blockchain technology by itself however it wouldn\'t offer anywhere near as much security as the Bitcoin network does.': 1, ' Unconnected to the existing road system or an unconnected to anything road to nowhere?.....So, your answer is that blockchain technology holds no promise for existing financial institutions? and that it is only a matter of time until those that report to be interested in blockchain technology but not bitcoin is that they are misguided and will eventually come to the conclusion that they cannot have one without the other?': 2, "bitcoin gives Bitcoin it's value, not the other way around.\n\n\nTechnically you can split them but the network effect would be lost and would be vastly less secure than the Bitcoin network is so people wouldn't get involved or use it for anything important.\n\n\nSo it's a bit like saying, yes you can technically build a new unconnected road system but why would you?\n": 2, "The blockchain only makes sense if you are trying to make a public ledger that no single party has control over. Any other system would make more sense than a blockchain if it was a single party, a consortium of parties, etc. \n\nBlockchain technology is incredibly wasteful due to the proof of work that's required to make it resistant against attacks (let's ignore proof of stake systems for the sake of argument). \n\nBecause of that, you need incentives for parties to support that network. Now, you can try to do that externally to the blockchain, through payments, but that introduces a 3rd party, contracts, and a constraint on the amount of computational power that can be applied to protect the network. The party(ies) that are trying to have the system secured by pumping money in are basically adding an external factor to the system that they could just do themselves more cheaply.\n\nSo that brings you back to the (semi) centralized solution. Why spend so much money on hardware for proof of work just to secure the system when you could just as easily use signatures to declare which blocks are valid?\n\nSo in order to truly make the system decentralized, everything that supports it has to be internal to the system.
