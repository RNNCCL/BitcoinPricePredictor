When someone pushes a transaction to the blockchain it is has to be confirmed by being included in the data of the next block to be mined. On average a confirmation takes about 10 minutes. Someone may submit a transaction right after a block has been found and must wait on average another 10 minutes before their transaction receives a confirmation when the next block is found, and someone may submit a transaction one minute before a block is found and will only have to wait that one minute before their transaction receives a confirmation. \n\nNow say for instance on a particular exchange one person requests a withdraw and then another user requests one 3 minutes later, they both withdraw to wallets that require one confirmation.

But it can be fairly okay. The situation I am reporting isn\'t some hypothetical fantasy, it\'s my interpretation of the altcoin scene of today, where, by and large, the value of the top coins actually is proportional to how much they innovate.\n\nI think it\'s done pretty well, but as you say, it\'s far from perfect. Litecoin for instance basically did not innovate and is one of the largest altcoins. Dogecoin innovated in use of a meme. They deserve something for that, but $17, and at one point $42, million for their clone-coins?\n\nFurthermore, the reason why Bitcoin, which I contend is far and away the most innovative of the bunch, in pioneering distributed consensus and creating the cryptocurrency asset class, has a market share largely proportional to its market cap, and the reason why Litecoin is not larger than it is, is because of a conscious effort by individuals to discourage the use of Bitcoin copycats, which you also cited as a factor in preventing fragmentation:\n\n> (2) moral pressure on network-effect-providing businesses\n\nWhat I\'d add is that this pressure is not inevitable. It\'s due to the peculiar belief set of cryptocurrency users. In the case of the dominance of Bitcoin, it\'s largely due to Bitcoin maximalism.\n\nIn other words, posts like my OP are part of the evangelism that discourages fragmentation. Of course, other factors are also inhibiting fragmentation. At this stage, I\'d guess Bitcoin\'s network effect is the largest factor.\n\n>And that\'s perfectly fine. I\'m all about "it\'s the technology that matters, not the currency". The technology is just as useful at 10x less valuation. I don\'t care about "a cryptocurrency" displacing fiat, I care about the development of cryptoeconomic infrastructure. If there was a zero-counterparty-risk way to simulate dollars, I would say give up bitcoin and use that.\n\nThe market cap is a fairly good proxy for adoption. If the combined market were lower, it would likely mean cryptocurrency technology were adopted by a smaller percentage of the population. That would mean less development on cryptocurrency infrastructure.\n\nI\'m also not perfectly fine with governments retaining the ability to tax the population, for the interest of their economic elite, via central bank inflation, when we have the opportunity to create a large cap asset class that is distributed.\n\nMore importantly, there is a considerable possibility that having a large market cap is the only way in which cryptocurrency, and its infrastructure, can be useful enough for mass adoption. For example, a larger market cap means a more secure blockchain, which is an essential quality if it is going to be the basis of the global financial system. There\'s also no guarantee that there are robust alternatives to a free floating value for distributed currency, and if there aren\'t, then large market cap is essential for reducing the volatility of distributed currency. \n\n>Today\'s culture, largely thanks to the efforts of myself, David Johnston and a few others, is much more pro-premine, and so in this world the equivalent of Tenebrix itself is much more likely to succeed.\n\nWell, that\'s good, but culture is not guaranteed to always be amiable to innovation. \n\n>Was it? I do not recall there ever being a point where Litecoin exceeded 10% of BTC. \n\nLTC got to $39 on BTC-e in late Nov 2013, about 4% of the BTC price. The market was valuing LTC\'s eventual coin supply at 16% of BTC\'s at the time. There appeared to be a real possibility that LTC supporters would succeed in making it the "silver to Bitcoin\'s gold". Some of the developments at the time included Coinbase expressing openness to supporting Litecoin and hiring Litecoin creator Charlie Lee, and MtGox annoucing it would support LTC. Without the very strong adherence to Bitcoin maximalism among a large subset of cryptocurrency users, and the consequent intense campaign against fragmentation, that countered the campaign by Litecoin speculators, this could have unfolded.\n\nI believe the risk of a total collapse in market, VC and technical interest in cryptocurrency would have been far greater if that scenario had occurred.\n\n>Ripple is the one that got much closer, actually exceeding bitcoin\'s market cap at one point (technically, including the latent units, it\'s at 60% of BTC now).\n\nRipple didn\'t really compete with Bitcoin from what I observed. It didn\'t serve the same markets, or have a similar function. The reported market cap was also not seen as particularly credible by many, because the small share of the total XRP that was actively trade and the thin trade volume meant the well financed company behind the currency could manipulate trading to engineer a higher market price.\n\n>The problem is not the one-time accrual, it\'s more of a fragility-theoretic justification. It\'s that there exists the ability to lay claim to a specific percentage of society\'s wealth, and that percentage stays fixed, and grows, by default, with no risk. That\'s not how things should work; the way things should work is that your percentage of wealth should decrease over time unless you actively invest into business projects.\n\nFair point. On thinking on it some more, I believe the value accrued to holders of a deflationary currency is a type of economic rent, and therefore inefficient.\n\nHowever, I believe Bitcoin\'s suppression of economic rent from other sources through the ability it gives to people to bypass financial gatekeepers far outweighs the deflationary economic rent it would allow its holders to collect, and that the fixed money supply of Bitcoin is likely necessary for it to supplant the current financial system. \n\nI also believe that even with the best efforts of Bitcoin maximalists, there will still be effective inflation in the cryptocoin supply. The much greater risk, I believe, is in cryptocurrency being too inflationary to compete with centralized monetary institutions, and as a consequence, the legacy gatekeepers remaining in place. \n\n>Well, that\'s only true if we go with the non-fixed-supply model...\n\nThat is why I think it\'s appropriate to have slight inflation to compensate innovation in cryptocurrency, and why I floated the idea of sidechains with currency that\'s partially backed by bitcoin and partially backed by new coins to earn their makers seigniorage.': 1, 'Merge-mining.

All I hear is innovative, innovative, but what use is innovation if security and economics break down. I\'d be happier than anyone if sidechains could actually work.': 1, '> we just need a great blockchain technology to change the world.\n\nIMO, more like 5-50 great blockchain technologies.': 2, "> because of a conscious effort by individuals to discourage the use of Bitcoin copycats ...  In the case of the dominance of Bitcoin, it's largely due to Bitcoin maximalism.\n\nHere I agree with you on the existence of the effect, but I disagree on the underlying moral theory. It's not Bitcoin maximalism that is the primary cause, it's the ideology that uninnovative copycat coins are bad. As evidence I will submit the public response to Stellar, which is an uninnovative copycat of Ripple, and which got pretty roundly criticized around these parts (and around the non-maximalist parts of the community as well).\n\n> The market cap is a fairly good proxy for adoption. If the combined market were lower, it would likely mean cryptocurrency technology were adopted by a smaller percentage of the population. That would mean less development on cryptocurrency infrastructure.\n\nI'd disagree there. Let S = store-of-value usage, T = transactional usage and N = non-financial usage of cryptocurrency technology. I care about maximizing S + T + N. The market cap, however, is more like 100S + T + 0.01N (since market cap is proportional to cash holdings demand at any particular time, desire to hold cash for a really long time (ie. SoV demand) has a wildly disproportionate influence, and non-financial usage only pays transaction fees). So it is entirely possible to imagine two futures A and B, where in A the market cap is $30 billion, in B it's $900 million, and yet we would both prefer B to A because A is all S whereas B has much more T and N.\n\n> For example, a larger market cap means a more secure blockchain, which is an essential quality if it is going to be the basis of the global financial system.\n\nThis I will grant, although with the proviso that it provides increased security against external entities but not internal entities.

Sure, they do often replace each other fairly quickly, and that's a good thing. But after the market settles down, there are always companies that manage to last many decades or even centuries.

Please can we get some realism for once?": 1, '> But I think there is a very good possibility that these forces will not always be sufficient to reward a market share that\'s proportional to the value contributed by a cryptocurrency\'s developers.\n\nAgree, the market is nothing close to perfect. But it can be fairly okay. The situation I am reporting isn\'t some hypothetical fantasy, it\'s my interpretation of the altcoin scene of today, where, by and large, the value of the top coins actually is proportional to how much they innovate. There is a bias in favor of old coins (PPC and LTC) (which interestingly enough actually supports my thesis that you won\'t have BTC or any other coin dropping 80% overnight just because some newer one comes along), but aside from that the valuations are all completely reasonable. Ripple is worth 50x more than stellar, the top 10 coins except LTC are all substantially innovative and the lower coins much less so, etc.\n\n> Combined, the two blockchains would have been far less valuable than Bitcoin is now\n\nAnd that\'s perfectly fine. I\'m all about "it\'s the technology that matters, not the currency". The technology is just as useful at 10x less valuation. I don\'t care about "a cryptocurrency" displacing fiat, I care about the development of cryptoeconomic infrastructure. If there was a zero-counterparty-risk way to simulate dollars, I would say give up bitcoin and use that.\n\n> We can look at the history of altcoins for a counter-example. Litecoin copied almost everything from Bitcoin, save for a different block time, and the use of Scrypt for its PoW algorithm. Both of these relatively modest innovations were pioneered by Tenebrix, yet Litecoin\'s market share was thousands of times greater than the former. Given the similarity of Litecoin to Bitcoin, it should have had an insignificant market share relative to Bitcoin\'s, yet for a long time, its market cap was 10 percent of BTC\'s.\n\nThe history there is that Tenebrix was the innovative one with using Scrypt as a mining algorithm (which according to the standards of the day actually counted as a major achievement; this was before every coin was coming out with its own mining algo), but the culture was heavily anti-premine. Tenebrix was premined, Litecoin was not, and so Litecoin won. Today\'s culture, largely thanks to the efforts of myself, David Johnston and a few others, is much more pro-premine, and so in this world the equivalent of Tenebrix itself is much more likely to succeed.\n\n> At one point, Litecoin came close to becoming a prominent alternative to Bitcoin ... It was due to a conscious campaign by Bitcoin maximalists that this scenario did not pan out.\n\nWas it? I do not recall there ever being a point where Litecoin exceeded 10% of BTC. Ripple is the one that got much closer, actually exceeding bitcoin\'s market cap at one point (technically, including the latent units, it\'s at 60% of BTC now).\n\n> Under those circumstances, early adopters in BTC would profit handsomely. It would be among the largest, if not largest financial windfalls in history. However, as I\'ve argued previously, a one-time financial windfall is not as dangerous to wealth equality as it may appear. The key reason for this is that the BTC windfall could only be spent once.\n\nThe problem is not the one-time accrual, it\'s more of a fragility-theoretic justification. It\'s that there exists the ability to lay claim to a specific percentage of society\'s wealth, and that percentage stays fixed, and grows, by default, with no risk. That\'s not how things should work; the way things should work is that your percentage of wealth should decrease over time unless you actively invest into business projects.\n\n> Land is unique in that there is physical scarcity of land, and no assets that have the potential to act as substitutes. Bitcoin\'s position will always be more precarious as there will always be more avenues to accrue market share to new currency stock than there will be to generate land.\n\nWell, that\'s only true if we go with the non-fixed-supply model...\n\n': 3, '>Opposition to parasitism without innovation would be my one-word change in emphasis. If these were non-financial networks there would be no moral opposition to forks, just "meh, this one has more network effect".\n\nYes, parasitism off of the developers of the original blockchain, who, due to the nature of cryptocurrency, have a way to profit off of their open source development. I used \'inflation\' because it also dilutes the holdings of investors into the original blockchain. That\'s inflation that\'s not parasitic, but I believe, with all things being equal, it\'s still harmful to the industry and technology as a whole.\n\n>Possible, though not necessary. Gold has high S, low T. Alternatively, as Robert Sams argues, S may even actually crowd out T because S invites more volatility.\n\nWell, on this point, I guess we can agree to disagree. \n\nI don\'t think there\'s any likelihood that greater S utility diminishes T utility. Sure it could have some crowding out effect, that in some cases, will result in a person choosing to save when they would otherwise choose to spend, but the positive externalities of the larger market cap that greater S utility brings for the currency\'s utility in general, will result in higher T utility overall, IMO. More exchanges, more traders, greater purchasing power, more public attention, more multi-use software tools to handle the currency, etc.\n\n>I would agree right up to 2013, but less so now.\n\nTrue. I don\'t believe that the benefit of larger market cap has gone to zero, even if it has declined since the end of 2013, so it doesn\'t warrant being ignored.\n\n>Hmm, I actually get a quite different sense, particularly from the sheer number of VCs saying things of the form "it\'s the blockchain technology, not the currency, that matters" and nobody serious really contradicting them.\n\nHere\'s an example of a VC singling out the price of bitcoin as important for utility:\n\nhttp://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/01/21/why-bitcoin-matters/?_r=0\n\n>It is perhaps true right at this moment that the value of Bitcoin currency is based more on speculation than actual payment volume, but it is equally true that that speculation is establishing a sufficiently high price for the currency that payments have become practically possible. The Bitcoin currency had to be worth something before it could bear any amount of real-world payment volume. This is the classic \xe2\x80\x9cchicken and egg\xe2\x80\x9d problem with new technology: new technology is not worth much until it\xe2\x80\x99s worth a lot. And so the fact that Bitcoin has risen in value in part because of speculation is making the reality of its usefulness arrive much faster than it would have otherwise.\n\nNow to conclude, I want to clarify that between bitcoin\'s digital scarcity / market cap and blockchain technology innovation, I would always choose innovation as the more valuable of the two. I just think that there are ways to maximize blockchain technology innovation that are much less harmful to Bitcoin\'s digital scarcity, and by extension, the market cap of cryptocurrency in general.': 1, 'So I would posit a different valuation equilibrium: I expect the value of every cryptocurrency to be roughly proportional to the amount of original research and development that goes into it. This equilibrium will be enforced by (1) disproportionately large media attention toward innovative projects, (2) moral pressure on network-effect-providing businesses, (3) self-reinforcing expectations, which cryptocurrencies are based on by definition. This circumvents the standard infinite-number-of-currencies argument against Hayekian currency competition because each new successful currency now requires "proof of work" to create (the work being original R&D) hence production of a new currency (that does not get ignored) is no longer zero-cost. Also while you seem to be worried about Bitcoin crashing to zero I\'m actually more worried about the exact opposite outcome: Bitcoin going to $5m. Concern is basically [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1lfobc/i_am_a_timetraveler_from_the_future_here_to_beg/), though a bit less dramatic. The only other major example we have of a fixed-supply zero-risk asset existing as a fundamentally important building block of the economy is land, and history is replete with evidence that land tends to concentrate over time with the result that we ended up with "land reform" movements popping up every few centuries reshuffling everything again. Today we solved the problem only with property taxes. Meanwhile, if we go the multi-currency route, every currency will still go up; there\'s plenty of room. BTC specifically will just simply go up 500x instead of 10000x.\n\nAlso not related, but for the benefit of other people making another argument I just rediscovered this article by myself from 2013: http://bitcoinmagazine.com/6926/in-defense-of-alternative-cryptocurrencies/\n\nSo I was an anti-maximalist ("diasporist" perhaps?) before I had any particular incentive to be :)': 2, '> Here I agree with you on the existence of the effect, but I disagree on the underlying moral theory. It\'s not Bitcoin maximalism that is the primary cause, it\'s the ideology that uninnovative copycat coins are bad. \n\nThat\'s possible. I\'ve observed that Bitcoin maximalism, which I\'m defining as a belief that the digital scarcity of Bitcoin\'s currency, established by the combination of Bitcoin\'s fixed money supply and its market dominance, is important for the success of cryptocurrency, is motivating much of it the activity that has kept copycat coins at bay, but it might be secondary to "opposition to inflation without innovation" as the cause of the phenomenon.\n\n> I\'d disagree there. Let S = store-of-value usage, T = transactional usage and N = non-financial usage of cryptocurrency technology. I care about maximizing S + T + N. The market cap, however, is more like 100S + T + 0.01N (since market cap is proportional to cash holdings demand at any particular time, desire to hold cash for a really long time (ie.

We\'re still vulnerable to a collusion of three mining pools or 5-10 ASIC companies and will be nearly equally so at $4 billion or $400 billion.\n\nOne minor counter-point is that in the long run, a larger market cap, by encouraging growth in the cryptocurrency community, could lead to more innovation that reduces centralization in mining (e.g. P2Pool, Sidechains, Sidechain P2Pools, etc). That\'s on the speculative side of predictions though.\n\n> But this I would disagree with; if we are replacing central banks with something I favor the scheme described in Hayek\'s Denationalization of Money.\n\nThe reason I believe distributed currency could have different requirements for success than the private currencies Hayek envisioned is that it\'s unbacked, which is necessary for it to be a distributed. The lack of backing leaves only its scarcity as a source of value. The distributed nature of Bitcoin is its most important quality, and I believe the benefits it would provide over the type of currencies described by Hayek, outweigh the additional economic rent that it allows its holders to extract through deflation.\n\n> Don\'t you mean too inflationary here?\n\nAh yes thanks.\n\n> I believe the risk of a total collapse in market, VC and technical interest in cryptocurrency would have been far greater if that scenario had occurred.\n> Hmm, I would have expected a greater influx of VC revenue as VCs would have realized that they could be the ones to get on top of the market cap pile.\n\nIt\'s possible, but I get the sense that much of the big investments by VCs are being motivated by the perception that the success of Bitcoin is evidence that its underlying concept of distributed currency is sound, and not vulnerable to the outcome of hyper inflation that many [critics](http://seekingalpha.com/instablog/7761841-patrik-korda/1616371-bitcoin-bubble-2_0) of Bitcoin, and by extension critics of the model of distributed digital tokens as currency, have predicted for it.\n\nIf it had failed to maintain its market share, and that had resulted in a collapse in the combined market cap of cryptocoins, I think that faith in the concept would have evaporated.\n\n> In general, I view cryptocurrencies as being kind of like corporations. Sure, they do often replace each other fairly quickly, and that\'s a good thing. But after the market settles down, there are always companies that manage to last many decades or even centuries. So I\'m not worried that there won\'t be any long-term blockchain at all if Bitcoin loses its throne. \n\nThere will always be blockchains, but I don\'t know if there will ever be a widely adopted, low volatility distributed currency, and I believe the failure of the first stock of 21 million distributed currency tokens, after it has attracted the attention of the world\'s technological elite, would make the outcome less likely.\n': 1, "> This sentence reveals a lot about maximalists to me. You're literally saying that you don't want altcoins to even have the means to compete against Bitcoin. You prefer a world where no other project ecosystem even has a fighting chance.\n\nYes, but the way you present it makes it sound like I don't want alternative blockchain developers to be allowed to innovate and add new features to their projects. I do, but I want Bitcoin to adopt any feature they do. The reason why I want a dominant Bitcoin is that one of the essential qualities of a successful cryptocurrency is digital scarcity. \n\nWithout patent protection or government monopolies, the open source cryptocurrency space faces the risk of gradual fragmentation across an ever increasing number of blockchains. If these blockchains have independent coin supplies, this is essentially the same as inflation, but potentially at a rate far exceeding that of fiat currencies.\n\nIf one cryptocurrency manages to position itself to credibly maintain the lionshare of the market over the long run, through its network effect and ability to incorporate new innovations, then digital scarcity will be secured, and cryptocoins will have a chance of becoming a major asset class in the global economy. Bitcoin, as the first and largest distributed cryptocurrency, has the best chance of being that cryptocurrency. \n\nIf it were to be supplanted, with an associated mass sell-off and devaluation, I believe faith in the ability of cryptocurrencies to preserve value in the long run would be seriously damaged, as people would assume any successor to Bitcoin could face the fate that Bitcoin did, so my preference is that Bitcoin remain the standard and strengthen its position as such.": 1, "I have.

It would mean that the natural forces of the free market can maximize innovation, and there is no need for IP laws. But I think there is a very good possibility that these forces will not always be sufficient to reward a market share that\'s proportional to the value contributed by a cryptocurrency\'s developers.\n\nWe can look at the history of altcoins for a counter-example. Litecoin copied almost everything from Bitcoin, save for a different block time, and the use of Scrypt for its PoW algorithm.

Given the similarity of Litecoin to Bitcoin, it should have had an insignificant market share relative to Bitcoin\'s, yet for a long time, its market cap was 10 percent of BTC\'s.\n\nAt one point, Litecoin came close to becoming a prominent alternative to Bitcoin. There were a few major service providers in the Bitcoin space which were contemplating accepting it alongside Bitcoin. If that were to happen, it would have seen its legitimacy skyrocket. \n\nA cryptocurrency space divided along two nearly identical blockchains would have then been ripe for further fragmentation, as Bitcoin\'s network effect under those circumstances would have been even smaller than when Litecoin managed to seize a large share of its market.\n\nCombined, the two blockchains would have been far less valuable than Bitcoin is now, because the public would have perceived BTC-like cryptocoins as lacking a credible scarcity, and the situation could only have gotten worse with further fragmentation, similar to the rapid devaluation of Beanie Babies in the 1990s as the supply of \'limited edition\' runs increased, and other companies copied its business model to create their own \'scarce\' toys.\n\nIt was due to a conscious campaign by Bitcoin maximalists that this scenario did not pan out. I think until Bitcoin, or another cryptocurrency, attains a network effect that\'s large enough where the possibility of it losing significant market share to a new cryptocurrency in the near future drops close to zero, a conscious effort is required by cryptocurrency advocates to preserve the digital scarcity of the 21 million BTC or whatever money supply is used by the dominant blockchain if it\'s not BTC. \n\nAs Bitcoin is currently dominant, and the first cryptocurrency in history, I think the best chance cryptocurrency in general has of achieving mass adoption is if the cryptocurrency community rallies behind it.\n\n> Also while you seem to be worried about Bitcoin crashing to zero I\'m actually more worried about the exact opposite outcome: Bitcoin going to $5m. Concern is basically this[1] , though a bit less dramatic.\n\nUnder those circumstances, early adopters in BTC would profit handsomely. It would be among the largest, if not largest financial windfalls in history. However, as I\'ve argued previously, a one-time financial windfall is not as dangerous to wealth equality as it may appear. The key reason for this is that the BTC windfall could only be spent once. The real sources of wealth inequality are institutions that provide the wealthy with the ability to extract rent from the economy on a perpetual basis. Central banks would be perfect example of this.\n\nOver time, any wealth distribution will tend towards the natural ability of actors in an economy to accumulate more wealth, no matter what the initial wealth distribution is. I believe that in a free market, this generally holds true: give a homeless man $1 million, and in 20 years, he will likely be homeless again. Take a wealthy man\'s fortune away, and in 20 years he will be wealthy again.\n\nIn other words, under a free market, which Bitcoin would expand, greater wealth would not beget an ability to accumulate wealth at a faster rate, as it would in a controlled market where it\'s possible to purchase the ability to extract economic rent on a perpetual basis, and it is this ability that is at the heart of extreme wealth inequality. The professional history of extremely wealthy business people demonstrates this: the period during which their personal wealth increased at its fastest rate was when they were starting out, and had the least wealth. Political power is the opposite. With more control over the gatekeepers, those at the top can accelerate their expansion of power, until they have seized total control of the economy, which is what you see in authoritarian dictatorships.\n\nIn other words, Bitcoin would do far more to reduce wealth inequality, by reducing the ability of gatekeepers to permanently extract economic rent, than it would to increase it, by giving early adopters a large one time windfall.\n\nAlso, I do not believe a dominant Bitcoin necessarily means a fixed cryptocoin supply. Like in my partially pegged sidechain idea, there are means of expanding the money supply without risking a total devaluation of the dominant cryptocurrency stock. Mastercoin and Counterparty would be other examples of new currency supply being added, while still accruing value to bitcoin holders (in this case by making space in the Bitcoin blockchain more highly demanded).\n\n>The only other major example we have of a fixed-supply zero-risk asset existing as a fundamentally important building block of the economy is land, and history is replete with evidence that land tends to concentrate over time with the result that we ended up with "land reform" movements popping up every few centuries reshuffling everything again.\n\nLand is unique in that there is physical scarcity of land, and no assets that have the potential to act as substitutes. Bitcoin\'s position will always be more precarious as there will always be more avenues to accrue market share to new currency stock than there will be to generate land.\n\nAlso, even with the characteristic that distinguishes land from other fixed supply assets, concentration of land holdings could be a symptom of institutions in the economy that act as concentrators of wealth, rather than a cause of concentrated wealth.': 3, 'Yes I have noticed this as well.

To run a computer any colder than the cosmic background radiation would require extra energy to run a heat pump.  \n  \n>Now, the annual energy output of our sun is about 1.21\xc3\x9710^41 ergs. This is enough to power about 2.7\xc3\x9710^56 single bit changes on our ideal computer; enough state changes to put a 187-bit counter through all its values. If we built a Dyson sphere around the sun and captured all its energy for 32 years, without any loss, we could power a computer to count up to 2^192. Of course, it wouldn't have the energy left over to perform any useful calculations with this counter.  \n  \n>But that's just one star, and a measly one at that.

If all of this energy could be channeled into a single orgy of computation, a 219-bit counter could be cycled through all of its states.  \n  \n>These numbers have nothing to do with the technology of the devices; they are the maximums that thermodynamics will allow.
