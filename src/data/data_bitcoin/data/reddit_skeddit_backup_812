Everything we have at a given point in time was made with tools and machines that existed before that time.  Thus not only can you copy your tools, you can make better ones.\n\nAs a simple example, with nothing but sticks, animal sinew/vines, and rocks, you can build a furnace, dig up ore, and chop up wood and make charcoal.  With this furnace, you can smelt the ore into raw iron, which you can hammer with rocks when hot into a large lump and a small lump.  The large lump becomes a crude anvil, and putting a wood handle on the small lump gives you a crude hammer.  If you want to get fancy you can heat-treat your lumps to make them harder.  With a crude hammer and anvil, you can now make better tools like blacksmiths have done throughout history.  \n\nThe next set of tools are chisels, knives, and tongs, and pretty soon you have an industrial revolution.  Even today, the descendents of blacksmiths make robots and machine tools (machines that cut metal parts) using other robots and machine tools.  However, not all the parts of a robot are steel or aluminum alloy, so you need some *other* machines to wind coils for electric motors and other bits like that that are not just accurately shaped pieces of metal.\n\nOur project is bringing back a compact set that can mostly make itself.

The trick is that heating in a forge softens the metal so you can shape it, while your tools (hammer, anvil, and tongs) stay cool enough to not deform when you use them.  Optionally you also heat-treat the metal by quenching (plunging into water or other liquid) and slight re-heating.  \n\nQuenching freezes the metal in a harder but more brittle crystalline form.  Annealing, which is re-heating slowly to a specified moderate temperature, allows a controlled amount of change back to the default ductile form.  So depending on whether you need a hard edge (knives and chisels) or toughness (hammers and picks) you can get that in a controlled amount, even varying it in different parts of the same tool.\n\nClosing the loop for toolmaking, by supplying the raw materials (iron ore and charcoal), you needed shovels, picks, and axes (for wood to make charcoal), all of which the blacksmith can make the metal parts for directly, and the wood-shaping tools for the woodworker to make handles, wheelbarrows, wagons, etc.\n\n* Wooden ships in the age of exploration up through the 19th century often carried enough tools to rebuild the ship and repair most of the other parts.  They couldn\'t go to Home Depot to get a new mast after a storm.\n\n* Settlers at any time in history that moved into a new area would bring enough of a starter set of tools to live.  For example, in the US, when wagon trains were moving people west, each family would have their own farm tools, but typically they would try to include a smith or other toolmaker so they would not have to import replacements all the time.  That would be expensive, and at first they would not have a money economy to pay for them.  And of course, in a horse-based transportation system, a Farrier (specialist blacksmith for horse gear) would be as necessary as auto service places are in our modern society.\n\n* In our own project, we have tried to identify a self-reproducing set of tools and machines.  What we find is that 100% self-copying is an ideal, like a 100% efficient engine.  What you generally find is that there are hard-to-make items, or ones that use rare or hard to extract materials.  Rather than try to do those items internally, it is more efficient to trade something you *can* make for those items.\n\nStarting with a core starter set (the "seed factory") you can make a moderately high percentage of your own parts.  Using that set to make additional machines will increase the percentage you can make.  Some outside supply will be needed, but that will decrease as you build up your collection of tools and machines.  For a given sized community that the outputs are intended for, you eventually reach a "saturation point" where you have all the machines it is reasonable to have, and the remaining percentage of stuff you can\'t make you just trade for.  \n\nAt some point on your growth trajectory you can produce a new starter set, and thus replicate the growth.  This is similar to how a tree doesn\'t reproduce another tree directly.

QE is designed to fight deflation, which is a central bankers worst nightmare.  With deflation, people have more incentive to hoard their money than transact with it.  When people stop trading money for goods, services, or future investments then people start losing their jobs, etc.  Its bad.\n\nWhen things are "normal" the Fed tries to keep price inflation at around 2%.  That gives incentive for people to get rid of their dollars in trade for other things but not so much that its impossible to save.  You cannot get rich simply by hoarding dollars though.\n\nWhen a recession hits, the Fed typically begins to adjust interest rates in the economy downwards to increase the pressure on people to spend rather than save in order to get the economy moving again (they do the opposite if they feel the economy is moving unsustainably fast).\n\n(How they move interest rates is through the buying and selling of government bonds, but in the interests of not writing a textbook here, let\'s just assume that they can affect interest rates).\n\nDuring the Great Recession, they reached a point where interest rates were effectively zero and yet people were still hoarding money.  By some measures, price levels were deflating and the Fed got Really Scared.  So, they came up with the Quantitative Easing programs.  With QE, the Fed buys massive quantities of government bonds and mortgage backed securities on the market.  The depresses yields on assets less linked to the normal Fed rates and makes increasingly difficult to find places to put money that are safe and high yielding.  \n\nWith less "safe" investment opportunities, people will spend or they will invest in longer term, riskier projects (the type that cause the economy to grow over the short term through expensive capital equipment purchases and the long term through increase productivity.)\n\nTo prevent all this new money the Fed is creating to buy up bonds, it simultaneously pays the banks some interest to keep that money locked up.  \n\nThe entire idea behind all of this is people need to consume and they need to invest.

But this will only occur when the I.O.U.'s provide a transactional advantage over the actual money that is sufficient to compensate for the risk of default. For example it's MUCH more convenient to transact in gold I.O.U.'s rather than physical gold. Similarly it's much more convenient to transact with electronic checkbook money as opposed to physical cash. In contrast, bitcoin IOUs don't provide a significant transactional advantage over actual bitcoins. (Although this may change if bitcoin is not able to scale in a way that keeps transaction fees reasonably low.) Also, there's no system of implicit and explicit governmental guarantees that would back up the issuers of Bitcoin I.O.U.'s. There's no FDIC insurance for your Coinbase account to make you indifferent as between holding actual bitcoins versus an IOU from Coinbase for bitcoins. And even if there were, there's a big difference between guaranteeing a dollar IOU vs. a bitcoin IOU. The dollar's monetary base can be expanded at the push of a button in the event of a crisis.

First is because they are doing it to fight an increase in deflation from many sources  (collapsing debt, falling velocity, etc) which pushes inflation down. Another reason is they often try to direct the money created in such a way that it doesn\'t get to the general public and raise general inflation through a process called "sterilization." Basically what sterilization does is keep the money in the banking system (by the Fed offering higher risk free interest rates to banks to basically buy back the money they created) so banks lend it back to the Fed rather than out to the public causing general inflation. The result is banks make smaller risk free profits (and the stock market booms and the wealth disparity increases), while ordinary folks are seeing continued unemployment and decreasing wages as it apparently hasn\'t helped cause a general recovery as well as they had hoped. \n\nQE is supposed to end in a few weeks so we\'ll see if the stock market crashes or if they decide to continue QE or what.

Also, the government became "Ebola management handlers" when they founded the CDC (center of disease control), so there\'s that.\n\n>What if, instead, we had a responsible, adult society that institutionalized a health organization that would work together with private hospitals and private transportation agencies?

Or else, their customers will leave or sue them.\n\nYour implying that this is somehow the best solution? That your solution is the responsible and adult solution? That\'s so incredibly delusional and pretentious it blows my mind. Where does the money come from to institutionalize a health organization? They don\'t need to provide a high quality product, because people need to fly and where are you going to leave to as a customer? You can\'t go out and get a pilots license and a Cessna for the price that you can get a flight from California to Florida. And sue for what? "I got Ebola on your plane." "That\'s too bad, we didn\'t know someone with Ebola was on our plane."\n\n>But instead, we keep asking government to take responsibility for us, so that we don\'t have to act like adults. We ask the government to shut down the flights, to regulate the spread, to do all this nonsense. And they are failing so bad at it, that I don\'t see why anyone in their right mind would trust the same people who gave us the "DMV" to also deal with a highly dangerous epidemic. You\'re basically asking for failure.\n\nRight. We\'re asking the CDC to take care of disease because as an average citizen I don\'t have a degree in biology, and I don\'t have the time to figure out how Ebola works, so I pay my taxes and expect the CDC to handle it. Are you seriously comparing the DMV to every government institution? Are you fucking kidding? I guess we should shut down NASA then too because clearly any government department is staffed with entry-level workers who don\'t give a fuck because that\'s how the DMV is.\n\n>Will people take care of themselves someday?

Energy crisis? We are increasingly shifting to clean energy solutions. A global pandemic? Such a good example of how Ebola is overblown. Turn off the news and fucking read. Ebola has existed for years, its been contained before and we moved on. Ebola is only contagious when showing symptoms, which makes it much easier to contain. Media hype is for fear, fear sells. We have no "global war". We are not at war, we choose to have our troops in a dangerous area. We choose to do preemptive homeland security. Dwindling resources? Yeah, maybe fossils fuels but we are progressing towards a future where they will be exponentially less used. The only legitimate fear there is the financial crisis, which wouldn\'t kill the human race. Humanity will have its rough spots, but we aren\'t fucking turkeys.

As responsible, intelligent adults, we can organize institutions for the homeless and poor. In fact, the gap between the rich and the poor as well as the number of people who are considered poor has grown immensely since the government began playing a role in "solving poverty". Government does what people could do themselves, except 100X less efficiently. Particularly, when our money isn\'t being burned for wars that we don\'t need to be involved in.\n\nI think the advancement came when we were originally instituted as a free country, and have been falling behind more and more as we became less responsible and a country of helpless children rather than adults.': 1, '1-3% (randomly chosen to prevent pattern recognition)': 1, "Coinbase sent me an email asking for\n1) Where my bitcoins came from\n2) Where the money to get bitcoins came from\n3) The purpose of my bitcoin transactions\n\nWith the threat of locking my account if I didn't comply with this out-of-the-blue request within 7 days.": 11, 'At this point i believe bitcoin is going to be a tool for crime.

Cat and mouse, not going to work until the entire economy is shut down, and not even then will it be possible. Im thinking about the economy that exists in jails, where even drugs get around.

I\'d rather people aspire to work hard, get educated, and behave like responsible adults. Volunteer and give as intelligent adults. If people cared about the South Side of Chicago, they can do things about it without getting the government involved. \n\nStealing from others isn\'t a solution. Having the government get involved is a cop-out from actually doing anything and taking personal responsibility. If the majority of the people wanted to help, they can and should go ahead and do it, without making it some legal mandate. If the majority of people don\'t give a rats ass about the poor, then making it a legal mandate means the government no longer represents the people. In either case, the government doesn\'t need to be involved in this problem.\n\nThe root cause of poverty isn\'t a lack of handouts from government. It\'s much deeper than that. If anything, government handouts have only made things worse. It\'s created huge populations of people who depend on it.\n\nNobody is arguing that people don\'t need some kind of assistance. But time and time again, the government has proven to be completely awful at providing it. It becomes political. Why let it? The US didn\'t even have an income tax until recently and economically flourished before that time. It didn\'t lack the money to function. It did lack the money to engage in unnecessary departments. The US had the highest young education ranks in the whole world until public education was introduced, and subsequently pulled the rank down to among the worst in the developed world.\n\nWhen we take our ability to help the poor or educate our children and give it to the government, we forfeit some of the greatest opportunities for advancement and improvement. We let bureaucracy take over leading to waste, ignorance, and politics. Look at how technology has improved with every new generation of computers and smartphones. A competitive market to deliver faster, better results. Imagine that in education. You have schools competing to educate children better. To provide them with MORE resources and MORE effective ways, rather than following some "government-mandated" policy of what is supposed to be the "correct curriculum" and "method of teaching" and "standardized testing". Private schools destroy public education in most instances, because they have to deliver competitively. There are some public schools that do well, but that does NOT mean things couldn\'t be even better. Imagine if government got involved in regulating and standardizing mobile phones. We\'d be using 1980\'s technology at best. Just the same, educational technology is decades if not a century behind. And we\'re suffering big time from it.\n\nThe country is a disaster and needs to be rebuilt with the principles that allowed it to flourish. Real money (like Bitcoin), real education (competitive private education only), real income (no income tax), real charity (not welfare), real savings (self-directed retirement, not ponzi-social-security, not war-mongering inflation), and real freedom.\n\nPerhaps you\'re right, a temporary band-aid is to just keep redistributing the money by taking it from the rich, more and more. But at some point, the rich will say, "fuck this, im leaving the country for one that isn\'t so decrepit that the millions of poor people chase me around with pitchforks". And once they leave, there will be nobody left to finance the welfare. And they ARE LEAVING, believe it or not. More and more businesses are moving to other countries. Wealth is leaving America. Nothing is solved. We need to change the fundamental design, which isn\'t hard, it\'s what the founding fathers revolutionized. It\'s written into the constitution and the origins of the country.\n\nUnless we tackle the root of this problem with education and real money, we\'re just going to be shoving issues left and right, robbing peter to pay paul, and in the end the same issue will crop up again in a different way.': 4, 'This is an example of the template email that EFF generates for you to send:\n\n> Dear Superintendent Lawsky and General Counsel Syracuse,\n> \n> I\xe2\x80\x99m writing you today to express my deep concerns about the \xe2\x80\x9cBitLicense\xe2\x80\x9d proposal.

It seems to be a popular American libertarian viewpoint that any state structure advocating for social services is Communist, and that completely incorrect classification needs to end soon for the good of rational discourse everywhere.\n\n> Perhaps you\'re right, a temporary band-aid is to just keep redistributing the money by taking it from the rich, more and more. But at some point, the rich will say, "fuck this, im leaving the country for one that isn\'t so decrepit that the millions of poor people chase me around with pitchforks". And once they leave, there will be nobody left to finance the welfare. And they ARE LEAVING, believe it or not. More and more businesses are moving to other countries. Wealth is leaving America. Nothing is solved. We need to change the fundamental design, which isn\'t hard, it\'s what the founding fathers revolutionized. It\'s written into the constitution and the origins of the country.\n\nThis is again a super common American libertarian viewpoint that is antithetical to rational discourse and argumentation.  Social services = taking from the rich = business flounder = business leave.  This is completely incorrect.  There is tons of evidence out there that [business does best in an environment of low income inequality](https://www.globalcreditportal.com/ratingsdirect/renderArticle.do?articleId=1351366&SctArtId=255732&from=CM&nsl_code=LIME&sourceObjectId=8741033&sourceRevId=1&fee_ind=N&exp_date=20240804-19:41:13) (and this is from S&P, pretty much the most pro-business source you can find anywhere).  Despite our "oppressive government and social services", income inequality has been [increasing](http://eml.berkeley.edu/~saez/alvaredo-atkinson-piketty-saezJEP13top1percent.pdf) over the last 50 years (read the paper, it\'s mostly due to capital income and tax breaks for upper income brackets that this trend has been happening more in the United States than in Europe, Japan, or other countries worldwide).  Also, business has been [prospering like never before](http://www.economist.com/node/21564414).  And what business are leaving America exactly?  Are you telling me that if we increase the capital gains tax by 5%, Apple and Pepsico will decide to go open up shop in Uganda because the taxes are lower?  Or that Joe Public will move to Mexico to start his business without oppressive government regulations?  Where exactly are business going (for non-tax haven purposes, I mean **actually moving their HQ and operations**) outside the US?  I question this premise, I question the conclusion, and I question the faulty logic that got you there because it seems to be completely divorced from reality.\n': 2, 'They believe the average person is too incompetent to solve their own problems, and the frustrating part is that I agree. A huge drain on free-thinkers and intellectuals.': 5, "This is a great example of how politicians don't think they represent us.  They think they rule us.": 54, 'That they do.

': 1, 'DarkCoin has working anonymity now.  darkcoin.io': -4, '> If you don\'t understand that people will move businesses if the regulatory or economic environment is better in a different country, you are unrealistic. But there\'s no point in arguing, because the proof is in the pudding. Every damn day, we see the government failing the people.\n\nSo if the government is failing, and according to you government is failing implies business leaving, where are the business leaving?  Where?  I just don\'t think this is true.  And your argument that we will ask for 90% increases if we get 5 today is also ridiculous.  We already tax people at non-zero percentages.  By your argument, we would then be taxing people across the board at 90%.  [Slippery slope fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slippery_slope).\n\nThe US founding fathers also didn\'t advocate from freedom for taxation at all.  Their campaign was "no taxation without representation".  Do you think businesses pay a higher percentage of taxes than they get representation in the Government today?  Do you think the wealthy do?  The middle class?  The poor?  In my analysis, the answer seems to be "no, no, yes, yes" to those. \n\n> More freedom = Less bureaucracy = more competition = Better education = less poverty.\n\nFine, but these are subjective terms.  One person\'s freedom is another person\'s bureaucracy.  To me, food stamps are freedom from starvation because my boss at the GMC manufacturing plant I\'ve been working at for 20 years decides it\'s cheaper not to call me in for work tomorrow.  For you, it\'s a needless bureaucracy whose goal is to redistribute wealth in a "communist" way.   The problem with your arguments is that they look good on the surface, but they make hidden logical leaps that are often only evident if you closely analyze each step of your reasoning.  Everyone can agree that more freedom is good, but we can\'t agree about what freedom is.  To me, freedom means freedom from the need to go into debt to get an education, freedom from having to worry about putting food on my table if I lose my job, freedom from having to give 50% of my already low income to pay for basic services like health insurance that might, even if I have it, not fully cover me when I get sick, requiring me to declare bankruptcy and starve.  To you, this may mean bureaucracy.\n\n\n>But there\'s no way a 5% hike is a permanent fix to poverty.\n\nI never said that, it was just an example.  Obviously we can\'t solve poverty only through taxation, but I linked you to a paper that postulated that the main cause of recent increases income inequality is a flawed taxation model that takes disproportionately from income as opposed to capital gains.  So arguing against fixing this system by tweaking the rates of capital gains and income tax, as the paper (and all other sources I have seen, as well as my own conclusions) suggests, seems to be counterproductive to me.\n\n\nI\'ll leave you with one point.  Political ideologies are not a dichotomy; it\'s not the US constitution or communism.  I know you accused me of not understanding capitalism, but the reality is that I\'ve seen the effects of both communism and capitalism.  While I was lucky enough to never live in a Soviet bloc country, the same is not true for any other member of my family that\'s older than me.  I\'ve lived in a country where the impact and scars of communism were fresh everywhere you looked, and I\'ve also spent much of my life in the United States.  I\'ve read Marx, Engels, Smith, Friedman, Keynes, and many others.  All of these thinkers have valid points, but none of them are entirely correct and you shouldn\'t treat any of their works (or the works of a single person) as gospel.  While extremists on either side of the political and economic spectrums love to separate their dissent into groups and attack these groups and their ideology rather than the ideas of the individual that is speaking, reality is not so simple.  The groups are not so clearly defined, and even within a group there is such a huge diversity of ideology as to make attacks on group ideology irrelevant.  I think anyone who identifies as communist would find the idea of my being a communist laughable, and in fact I\'ve been called a dirty capitalist many times before.  \n\n\nAnd on the flipside I\'ve been called a communist more times than I can count (mostly by my American Republican friends if I\'m being honest here).  The reality is that as far as I see it there less difference between communist purist and market purists than they care to admit - both are systems for organizing a large number of people in an ad-hoc fashion without the need for a large centralized state.  Both promise prosperity for all, and while their tools and approaches are different (in communism the organization and production is motivated by the desire to advance the communal good of each actor, while in the market it is the "moral" action of a collection of rational self interested actors, therefore requiring money for account in the market and eliminating its need in communism), overall their message is the same: it is possible for humanity to self-organize into a society that offers prosperity to its active participants.  So the conclusion here is that "capitalists" and "communists" (these labels are really irrelevant but let\'s keep using them for the sake of argument) want the same thing and have a lot to learn from the strong points and shortcomings of each others\' approaches (anybody who has seen something like the late 1800\'s US knows that our past implementations of pure capitalism have had problems not confined to past implementations of pure communism).  While I subscribe to neither ideology, I also find the dogmatic McCarthy-era style anti-Communist straw manning that goes on in US political debates not only entirely unproductive and anti-rational, but also laughable as somebody who knows enough about Communist ideology to know that people like Barack Obama represent the furthest thing from that.\n\n\nE: also, as I replied the page reloaded and your comment changed.

Some of the exchanges are shady and none of them are well established but this was the case with bitcoin at one time also.\n\nI hold 95% bitcoin and I understand there is risk involved. the remaining 5% is spread between 3-4 other cryptocerrencies which is also risky. I put my money in other cryptocurrencies because I believe in them, I think they offer something bitcoin doesn\'t, I think they complement bitcoin, or I think they will appreciate in value.\n\nI\'m tired of people using the same arguments that people make about bitcoin to discredit altcoins. You don\'t want to invest in them fine. But don\'t forget about Mt. Gox and all the other smaller scams and failures we in the Bitcoin community have encountered along the way. And don\'t pretend like many or most of the people involved in bitcoin aren\'t looking to make money on their investment. Sometimes when I hear people from the bitcoin community talking about alts it almost sounds like people from conventional banking talking about bitcoin ("its so risky," "its amateur," "its just a bunch of people hoping to get rich," "too many scams" "underdeveloped infrastructure,").\n\n/End Rant\n\nTL;DR\nYes keeping money on an altcoin exchange is inherently risky ask the people who had money on mt gox how much less risky keeping money on a bitcoin exchange is. Some in the bitcoin community sound like conventional bankers when they talk about altcoins. We are on the cutting edge of the financial system risk is part of the game but don\'t pretend bitcoin is immune from it. I personally like the risk, high stakes, and \'frontier feel\' of bitcoin and other serious cryptos.': 2, 'Actually Ryan Kennedy aka Alex Green stole all your money http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/2jnid5/a_brave_nowformer_employee_shares_his_story_about/ ': 2, 'https://poloniex.com/ handles MyriadCoin and a boatload of other alts, as well as BTC.': 2, 'Download Myriadcoin QT.
