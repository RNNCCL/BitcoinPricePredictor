Up to \xc2\xa33000 could be won from the Imperial/EF Bitcoin Prize Fund for projects that utilise Blockchain technology, which allows secure transactions without the need for a central regulation authority \xe2\x80\x93 how Bitcoin is best described.\n\nThe competition is open to entrants from any department, be they Undergraduate or Postgraduate. Students can apply to carry out projects under the fund either individually or as a group, with grants up to \xc2\xa3500 available for equipment funding. They can also arrange for projects to count as credit towards degree courses.\n\nDr Llewellyn Thomas, a researcher with the Business School, has emphasized that the aim of the competition is not the focus of Bitcoin as a currency. Rather, it seeks to promote innovations on Blockchain technology, as the distributed trust mechanism of the Blockchain is the truly innovative aspect of said technology.\n\nThis is not Imperial\xe2\x80\x99s first foray into involvement with Bitcoin/Blockchain technology. The recently-launched Bitcoin Forum at Imperial, which consists of faculty members across all departments, will be working with EF to mentor and assist students entering the competition. Workshops on entrepreneurship and presentation skills, regular mixers, and talks from prestigious figures in the Bitcoin and business fields are just a number of things planned by the Forum and EF for those who register to take part. The Forum also hopes to facilitate cross-faculty partnerships throughout the course of this competition.': 1}, ("This is one of the highest voted images for WU vs Bitcoin (without the 'satoshis').

I'll look into it!": 1, "I mentioned two kinds of problems here, and I'm not sure which you're asking about:\n\n1. The bad RNG problem I mentioned is specifically a bug that was encountered [last year](https://bitcoin.org/en/alert/2013-08-11-android) with some android wallets where due to poor RNG the signatures from those wallets were leaking enough information to obtain private keys, and many people had funds stolen before the bugs were fixed.\n\n2. An unknown future ECDSA vulnerability that allows recovery of private keys from public key+signature. Obviously there is no good write up of this, because it either hasn't been discovered, or is being kept secret! :)\n\nIn either case, the simplest step to mitigate the attack is to spend *all* funds from a given address at once (sending any change to a new, previously-unused change address), and then never use that address again.\n\nAlso, the reason spending from an address is the trigger for this is because before that, the address only appears on the chain as RIPEMD160(SHA256(pubkey)), so even the key itself is not known at that point. Once you spend it though, the transaction you create contains the pubkey itself (to prove it's the key that matches that hash), and a signature from that key (to prove that the owner of that key approves of the transaction), which means you've lost your protection from any ECDSA flaws (known or unknown) that keeping your keys hidden provided.\n\nDirect multisig transactions do not get this protection, as all the pubkeys are there in full, but P2SH scripts *do*, since the entire redeem script is reduced to a hash until you spend from it (at which point you should re-key that too, but nobody really pushes for that currently).": 1, "Yes, that's true. Even 1 minute intervals would be more than adequate and if you did manage to use the same address twice in a minute it wouldn't be catastrophic, just non-optimal. Or, during address generation it could pre-check for being used and increment until non-used, depending on how smart the reading wallet is.": 1, 'Wut': 6, "You could reprogram a smartcard or use a small 8 bit Atmel CPU, you don't need more than that.

Several of the more notable markets have closed down due to regulations, but there are still several markets operating. Securities are bought and sold using only cryptocurrencies, and mainly in btc. You may have also heard that Overstock is working with Counterparty developers on creating a digital asset exchange platform, to be called [Medici](http://www.wired.com/2014/10/overstock-com-assembles-coders-build-bitcoin-like-stock-market/)\n\nSome of the markets require verification of some information from the asset issuer, so they at least know who they are (not that this offers any recourse in most cases). However, other markets do not require such verification and essentially allow anyone to create and issue a security.\n\nThe major issue of these markets is by far accountability. There is little to no effective means to hold the asset issuer accountable to similar standards you would see upheld in conventionally regulated financial markets; it just isn't possible. While many in the bitcoin world are familiar with the phrase *Caveat emptor* or 'Buyer beware', one can only go so far. It's possible, and relatively easy, for a person to establish a credible persona and business, run the business for several years without hitch, and then just take off one day never to be heard from again. It's happened countless times, and it will happen again.\n\nOn your point of selling shares in oneself, this is also happening already, albeit not in bitcoin (*yet*). The most notable example being [Mike Merrill, who sold 100,000 shares of himself at $1 each.](http://www.wired.com/2013/03/ipo-man/all/) Another example of a similar investment in another indivudials success is [Fantex.com, a website that sells shares linked to the income of a pro athlete brand.](https://fantex.com/)\n\nThese are both interesting advances from today's typical corporate equity investments, and you're likely to see other similar offerings in the future. While I feel bitcoin or blockchain technology is the natural progression of any modern financial trading market, accountability becomes a significant issue, just as it already is in bitcoin-denominated securities markets. How can investors who own equity shares in an individual be sure that the individual they invested in won't just stop paying dividends, or just disappear one day?\n": 2}, ('So glad I could do something for Bitcoin!', 111): {'The Bitcoin tip for 65,043 bits ($25.00) has been collected by *bwrt*.\n\n\n[ChangeTip info](https://www.changetip.com/tip-online/reddit) | [ChangeTip video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AnfKpypMNw) | /r/Bitcoin': 2, '[deleted]': 5, 'Thanks a lot for you honesty.

Options and futures were invented thousands of years ago because because farmers wanted to mitigate their risk of being ruined by a bad harvest. Buyers of crops (such as wine or olive oil producers) wanted to mitigate the risk of very high grape or olive prices. So they agreed to enter into a fixed-price contracts for future transactions. The idea today is the same. \n\nPatrick Byrne, CEO of Overstock, wants a well-developed derivatives market for bitcoin so that Overstock can hold more bitcoin and do more with bitcoin. For example, he can buy the option to sell bitcoin at the price at which he acquired them. This would allow Overstock (and more importantly its shareholders) to avoid the risk of bitcoin's value crashing while Overstock is holding bitcoin. At the same time, he could sell the option to buy a portion of those bitcoin for a certain price to someone else. That would allow him to hold bitcoin very cheaply with little risk, which could be more advantageous than immediately converting all bitcoin income to dollars.

": 14, 'Will this have affect on price?': 1, "It's not just gambling.\n\nIn any derivatives market, there are exactly three types of traders:\n\nHedgers: they utilize derivatives to reduce exposure to price fluctuations of an underlying. For instance, with a swap, a hedger can lock in a fixed price for oil going forward. Would the price of oil go up, then the swap would compensate for it. However, if the price goes down, the hedger would not be able to benefit from this as the swap will demand a payment offsetting the lower ool price. For Bitcoin, imagine a swap that locks in a price in dollars per bitcoin for a certain time period.\n\nSpeculators: they speculate on price changes of an underlying. They enter into for instance swap contracts with hedgers. In the oil swap example above, the speculator thinks the oil price will go down.\n\nArbitrageurs: they make money by trading on incorrect valuations of a derivative or underlying. They buy undervalued derivatives while simultaneously selling the overpriced, equivalent derivatives, and pocket the difference, risk free.": 1, 'Or hedge risk.': 2, 'Can these be exercised for delivery?  ': 5, 'I just used the swap as an example. With a swap, any price fluctuations are generally offset daily, for the duration of the swap. Every day, some money is transferred between the hedger on the one end of the swap, and the speculator on the other end.\n\nRisk can also be offset using a future or forward. For instance, imagine that you expect a payment of 100 BTC halfway january 2015, and that today, 1 BTC is worth USD 380. Of course, you don\'t know what a BTC will be worth in three months. If you don\'t do anything, you may end up receiving USD 350 per BTC, or perhaps if you are more lucky, 500 USD per BTC. Most businesses will not accept this uncertainty however and will seek to lock in a fixed price per BTC using a future contract. In tradespeak, they want to hedge their currency risk.\n\nThat can be done with a BTC future. For instance, on [OrderBook](https://orderbook.net/) (formerly known as ICBIT) bitcoin futures are traded. In particular, note the [january 2015 futures contract ("BUF5")](https://orderbook.net/symbols/BUF5) and its [price](https://orderbook.net/trade) (select the contract in the dropdown). At the moment of writing, the BUF5 contract values 1 BTC at USD 395 when the contract expires at January 16, 2015 at exactly 20:00 UTC.\n\nThe currency risk can now be hedged by buying sufficient BUF5 contracts on the exchange to match the incoming amount of 100 BTC. Now, the 100 BTC has effectively been sold for USD 395 per BTC on January 16th, 2015. The hedger can be certain to receive USD 39,500 (ignoring counterparty risk here for the sake of simplicity).\n\nThe speculator(s) on the other end of the contract have effectively bought BTC at USD 395 on January 16th. They are betting that by that time, 1 BTC will be worth more than that, and pocket the difference.': 2, "I believe not because you are not buying a contract for the actual product, the contract is in effect only a bet of the price backed, not by the product, but by counter bets and NADEX's reserves.": 1, 'HURRAY!
