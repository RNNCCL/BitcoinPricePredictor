I simply say 'I'm a developer who works on projects for weeks involving thousands of dollars, this is not a job for me, it's a job for a CS college student who does some freelance work and spends 5 hours on a $200 job, instead of working at McDonalds for $50 for 5 hours'. \n\nThat's not me saying MY JOB as a developer is not a JOB... It's simply that 1) Jeff  Garzik is not a cheapskate for putting up his own money for the good of the community and 2) $200 is fine for a certain type of designer, and that ISN'T a senior guy making $100k a year to be able to afford living in SV. That's probably a college student looking to build a portfolio instead of spending the same time making $50 at McDonalds and building up zero experience and zero portfolio work.\n\nSo what is your alternative? Ask Jeff to pay $1k for something that doesn't require exquisite design, which is quite a sum of money meaning he might not want to do the project in the first place as it's too expensive for a small project he wants to do for the community? Or not have him do any design, stick with programmer-art, and have the designer student build up zero portfolio and zero money and instead work at McDonalds? Nobody is forcing anyone to do any work here. I'm a developer and yes I get quoted laughable rates sometimes, like literally $50 per APP for someone who wanted to spam 'dress up games' for 10 year old girls on iOS. I simply say no and move on. When someone quotes a small job, like a design mockup for a small grouping-feature as an upgrade to Garzik's programmer art, I'd simply say 'no thanks', knowing I'd have loved that job 6 years ago in college, as the alternative was loading cruise ships with hundreds of suitcases at 5AM for a shit wage which I did.\n\nLook I'm fully aware there's nuance here, that it's not easy being a designer and that there's a level of exploitation in the designer industry as there is in any industry.

Why should anyone use it?': 0, 'People will always say this. It doesn\'t make it true and it is no more than speculation. But still you must acknowledge TOR\'s weakness and, theoretical attacks. \n\nThe thing about TOR is if an attacker controls enough nodes it is very easy for them to make up all nodes in a circuit and identify users. In fact an attacker doesn\'t even need to control all 3 nodes that make up a circuit but only the first relay and exit node. Now no one controls enough to be able to unmask all users all the time. Agencies like the NSA and GCHQ do have a lot of TOR nodes they control though. If they cooperate with each other then this increases their power and their ability to unmask a user. This risk is reduced severely by using established nodes (guard nodes) as well as continually choosing and switching between different nodes to make up a circuit (I think new nodes are selected every 10 min by default if I remember correctly). \n\nWhat this means is that government can unmask a TOR user for a very limited period of time and that this isn\'t a very targeted attack as the end user chooses the nodes. For the average TOR user this isn\'t a big deal because in the still very unlikely event that the nodes you connect to are that of an attacker and exposer is limited to no more than a few minutes. For someone operating a hidden service I would think this presents a bigger risk as it could identify a server (which would only be attached to your real identity if you are a complete moron). \n\nWhat this means is the more peers that comprises the network the more secure it is. If honest nodes significantly outweigh malicious ones you obtain a network that can not identify a user. The greatest contribution you can make to the TOR network is to go right now and run a  (preferably relay) node. In doing so you ensure the freedom of uncensored Internet for all. \n\nEdit: ["TOR Sticks"]( http://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2013/oct/04/tor-stinks-nsa-presentation-document).

You can go on a prediction market and buy a boatload of assets that says "pays 1 bit if the UN estimates ISIS killings to be above 2,000 by 2016". If there is a lot of demand for this asset, the price will be closer to 1 bit and the implied probability of the event will be close to 100%.\n\nBetters on prediction markets *pay you* to tell them the truth.

Then you could bet a small amount to "it will rain" as insurance. If it rains you make back the money of moving the wedding to another day. If it doesn\'t, no problem, it was a small amount for peace of mind. Other people who want easy money will bet to "it won\'t rain", and take what you paid.': 5, "> In a simplified version, it's like betting on events?\n\nYep.

It'll replace their arbitrary decision making with informed decision making.\n\n> So, is it good for the price of bitcoin? truth coin?\n\nAnything that makes people want to hold more bitcoins is good for bitcoin's price. If the only way to bet in prediction markets requires holding a cryptocurrency, then it will raise the price.": 2, 'Thanks for the video link.  I guess the main point to focus on is not getting information from the uninformed.  If you ask someone their opinion, they will invariably give it to you regardless of whether they know what their talking about.
