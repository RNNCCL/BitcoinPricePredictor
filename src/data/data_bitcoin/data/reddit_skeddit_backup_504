But I probably wouldn\'t want to do any sort of download onto the *offline* machine anyways - so I\'ll probably take a bit of time to upgrade Armory on both machines, downloading a \'deb\' package for the offline machine, if such a thing is still available, or maybe I\'ll want to build Armory from source \n\nBy the way, I also heard there was some weird thing in Armory where it was collecting data from users ie reporting the user\'s IP address to the Armory organization for marketing / survey purposes, and I wanted to look more into that before actually using Armory, and make any changes to maximize privacy.\n\nhttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=731315.0\n\nhttps://pay.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/2d5ze7/armory_wallet_collecting_data_from_users/\n\nI also wanted to look into using Tor before doing any sending, so as not to give away my geographic location. \n\nSo much stuff to figure out still.\n\nBut anyways, if I understand you correctly: you\'re saying I could create a wallet on the *offline* Armory machine (with no blockchain downloaded), put a password on this Armory wallet, and send some coins there from bitcoin-qt.\n\nI assume you mean:\n\n- really doing a *"send"*, sending them *over the network in the normal fashion via the blockchain* (in which case I believe the new Armory wallet can actually be *hierarchical-deterministic*, since Armory *itself* created the private keys based on the HD "master" code), and \n\n- *not* merely doing a "sweep" importing the coins (essentially "offline") locally from the bitcion-qt wallet into the Armory wallet (in which case the Armory wallet would *not* be HD, since it would necessarily contain keys which *weren\'t* generated using Armory\'s particular HD scheme).\n\nI guess this makes sense. \n\nAnd even while *Armory* doesn\'t have the full blockchain downloaded yet, I guess I could simply check the addresses on *blockchain.info* to see if the coins are there.\n\nNow this brings up yet another question: \n\nAssuming my bitcoin-qt client doesn\'t have the blockchain downloaded yet - but I *do* of course have my original wallet.dat file containing my coins: \n\n**Is it possible to send coins from a bitcoin-qt client which doesn\'t have a local copy of the blockchain yet?**\n\nIn other words, if blockchain-qt has the *wallet* (with the private keys), but it doesn\'t have the *blockchain* (with the worldwide transaction history), can bitcoin-qt send out coins?\n\nI\'m guessing that it could. \n\nAs far as I understand, having the wallet.dat containing the private keys simply means that the bitcoin-qt client "broadcasts the attempted spend to the network" - and as long as the *signature* of the spend is determined to be valid (by being based on the private key, which is in the wallet.dat file), then this is all that matters - since the distributed consensus is worked out by the miners *on the global blockchain* in order to decide whether to actually confirm the transaction (and isn\'t based on my *local copy of the blockchain*).\n': 1, "Yeah I think Armory's HD implementation is still home-grown (non-standard).": 1, "Electrum supports the standards for HD wallets, Armory has its own system (unless that's changed recently).\n\nNo, there is no IP address association.

If you're really concerned, just set it up to go through Tor (it's really easy to configure a SOCKS[5] proxy within Electrum), although this is not necessary because quite honestly nobody cares and no server is logging all that information.

This still does them no good, because **they don\'t know which encrypted private keys it pertains to.**\n\n- Say you\'re have an unencrypted cold paper wallet, and someone gains access to this. Now they can steal your coins, since info they have access to is "complete" (they can install the corresponding wallet program from scratch, plug in the unencrypted cold paper wallet, and steal your coins).\n\nSo I am kinda liking BIP38 - due to this extra "layer" it adds.\n\nAnyways, does this mean I\'m being crazy-paranoid for *not* keeping my bitcoins in the cloud (in BIP38-encrypted form)??\n\nI don\'t know, maybe I got carried away reading about cold storage a few years ago, and I kinda got stuck on that approach.\n\nAlso consider: A big exchange with millions of USD in BTC wouldn\'t simply BIP38-encrypt it and upload it to the cloud, would they? That would seem crazy - they\'re supposed to use cold storage.\n\nSo why do we insist that exchanges should use cold storage - while for individuals we think it\'s ok to simply BIP38-encrypt and upload to the cloud?\n\nMaybe people feel that there is some kind of cutoff point where having "lots" of BTC dictates cold storage and having "somewhat less" BTC allows BIP38-encrypted cloud backups?\n': 1, 'OK, I see what you\'re saying. \n\nBut actually I was just thinking back to the recent contest involving BIP38, where there was a 4-character unicode password, that took over a year to brute-force (due to the sheer number of unicode characters out there).\n\nI think the password in that case was something like 1\xe2\x99\xa5\xe0\xb8\xbf. (using the \xe0\xb8\xbf which actually stands for Thai currency, since unicode doesn\'t actually have a unicode character for "bitcoin" yet).\n\nhttps://pay.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/2yx99h/my_4_character_bip38_cracking_challenge_has_been/\n\nThis made me think that it would be pretty easy to strategically throw a few unicode characters into a passphrase - to make it harder to bruteforce, while still remaining easy to memorize.\n\nBut mainly what I\'m worried about, regarding the possibility of using a few unicode characters in a bitcoin-qt wallet password, is whether they\'ll actually get read and processed correctly by bitcoin-qt itself.\n\nI figure I could type up the password in some text editor and copy-and-paste it into the 2 "create passphrase" fields in bitcoin-qt - but since all that shows up in password fields is the usual sequence of \xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2 bullet characters (and since I have seen nothing in the bitcoin-qt documentation explicitly stating whether it supports unicode passphrases), then I would not feel 100% reassured that bitcoin-qt was interpreting the characters correctly.\n\nAlso, some unicode characters apparently come in multiple variants. This could make it difficult to type in a unicode password correctly.\n\nStill, I like the vastly larger "pool" of character unicode offers - it just seems great for passwords, to thwart brute-force attempts.': 2, "I didn't read everything, but I wanted to tell you that you shouldn't be using bitcoin-qt anyway, or any non-HD wallet for that matter.\n\nIf you are going to download the blockchain anyway, use Armory, which is waaaay better and super complete.

I\'m not sure if any wallet software does all these things yet.)\n\nMy old, existing bitcoin-qt wallet is kinda-sorta "cold" storage already - it was created years ago (on a Windows machine, unfortunately - but a fairly clean one, I hope :-), and a few weeks later it was copied to multiple "cold" digital storage devices, and the original local "hot" copies were deleted from the Windows machine (and hopefully the physical file space has over time been sufficiently trashed and overwritten on my almost-full hard drive in order to make that old deleted wallet.dat file forensically or hacker-ly unrecoverable from the Windows machine).\n\n**Short-term** I just want some additional simple security without having to research and install too much stuff - so this is why I was thinking of just putting a passphrase on the bitcoin-qt wallet.dat file, without having to learn how to properly use Armory or Electrum at the moment.\n\nAlso, for now and the foreseeable future, I\'m still going to be only hoarding / hodling, so there will be no need for any transactions whatsoever at the moment - aside from whatever transactions may be needed to move the coins into long-term cold storage at some point soon (eg, on Armory or Electrum).\n\nSo I\'m tempted to go ahead and just encrypt the bitcoin-qt wallet.dat file now since this takes almost no effort (and back up this new file onto multiple offline devices) - in order to buy some time to really learn the ins and outs of other wallets like Armory and Electrum.\n': 1, "If you encrypt your wallet, then the old wallet.dat can still work, but without passphrase.

In the strict orthodoxy of the efficient market theory, crashes must be due to sudden changes of the fundamental valuation of assets. However, detailed empirical studies suggest that large price jumps cannot be explained by news and are the result of endogenous feedback loops. Although plausible, a clear-cut empirical evidence for such a scenario is still lacking. Here we show how crashes are conditioned by the market liquidity, for which we propose a new measure inspired by recent theories of market impact and based on readily available, public information. Our results open the possibility of a dynamical evaluation of liquidity risk and early warning signs of market instabilities, and could lead to a quantitative description of the mechanisms leading to market crashes.\n": 3, 'If markets adjust to this kind of system, and this system is very good at predicting crashes, the only real way I can see the markets adjusting is to avoid the crashes.\n': 2, "Here's the thing about markets.\n\nThey're anti-inductive.\n\nIf this works, everyone will start doing it.

The bitcoin market is unique in that the order book is publicly available?  That's not true at all.  The order book is publicly available for most exchange traded assets.\n\nIn fact, the bitcoin market is probably much harder to analyze (correctly) in this way because it trades on many different exchanges, in different countries and currencies (which are also moving at the same time), each with different rules and funding options, and in different data formats.

That cannot predict the market, but could lead to better risk revard trading. If this ratio changes you have to be more careful.

By putting up some small amount of stock to buy or sell, they can use the act of its trade to infer there\'s a much larger demand coming onto the market at that exact time. \n\nNext, they need to create the appearance of liquidity by placing large buy/sell orders on other exchanges which they intend to cancel the moment an order comes onto the market. Without that liquidity the trader won\'t attempt a large order in the first place because then the price would reflect their order.\n\nSo, when an order to sell comes from a trader and their small buy order executes at the "market price" they get out of the way by withdrawing all their other buy orders, the price flashes lower as the phantom liquidity disappears, and the trader can only execute at a lower price. Then the HFT\'s arbitrage that couple of millisecond window to make a profit.\n\nThe way they create that window is by having the fastest fiber optic lines to and from their exchange and all other exchanges and to the trading floors. So the moment a trading firm executes an order it gets to their exchange first before any of the other ones and they can react to that trade in time to create an advantage at the other exchanges before the traders order reaches them.': 4, "A good example, OkCoin 1wk futures, right now. \n\nAll that action is because someone loaded up the other day (5th) and is now dumping.

The attack became public in November, when Mayor Mike Duggan told the Detroit News the city had refused to pay because the vandalized database was not being used and did not contain critical information.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was a good warning sign for us,\xe2\x80\x9d Duggan told the newspaper.\n\nIn that case, the attackers demanded payment in bitcoin, a digital currency that is much harder to trace than other forms of money. \n\nMoreover, in the Tewksbury case, hackers demanded that a bitcoin payment be sent through Tor, a technology that makes it very difficult to identify the physical location where the money is received.\n\nData security experts at Dell Inc. estimate that in a six-month period last year, CryptoWall infected more than 625,000 computers worldwide, including 250,000 in the United States. During that time, the gang that operated CryptoWall raked in about $1 million in ransom payments, according to Dell.\n\nAn earlier ransomware program, CryptoLocker, was even more profitable, hauling in between $3 million and $27 million, according to various estimates.\n\nThe Tewksbury attack revealed the hydra-like nature of some computer viruses. The Department of Justice declared last summer that an operation to disable CryptoLocker and a related virus had succeeded.\n\nYet other ransomware viruses have appeared in its place, doing basically the same thing.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is very likely a case of one of the many CryptoLocker copycats infecting police departments,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kyrksen Storer, spokesman for Fire Eye Inc., a Milpitas, Calif., cybersecurity firm that helped develop an online tool for retrieving files corrupted by CryptoLocker.\n\nThe Tewksbury attack featured ransomware called KEYHolder, which is designed to cover its own tracks. Tewksbury authorities sent their infected computer server to the Commonwealth Fusion Center, where Massachusetts State Police work with federal law enforcement agencies on antiterrorism and cybercrime cases. Despite their best efforts, the KEYHolder encryption proved unbreakable.\n\nThe department might have refused to pay if it had up-to-date backups of its files. Tewksbury police regularly back up their data, but those files had separately become corrupted and unusable. With no way to crack the code, Sheehan felt he had no choice but to pay to recover his original database.\n\nComputer security analyst Brian Krebs, author of the book \xe2\x80\x9cSpam Nation,\xe2\x80\x9d said it is no surprise ransomware attacks against police agencies have become public, while those against private companies have not.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re dealing with public funds,\xe2\x80\x9d Krebs said. \xe2\x80\x9cThey can\xe2\x80\x99t hide the fact that they paid the ransom.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAlthough most ransomware attacks are sent out by the thousands, Krebs warned that criminals may target specific businesses or government agencies that might be willing to pay larger sums.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou get inside of a pharmaceutical company or something like that, that has all their net worth tied up in their files,\xe2\x80\x9d Krebs said, \xe2\x80\x9cthey\xe2\x80\x99d be willing to pay a lot more.\xe2\x80\x9d': 2}, ("Industry groups oppose CFPB's proposal", 1): {}, ('I want to buy Bitcoins to pay for a VPN - is this guide (see link inside) still up-to-date and accurate?

I think the problem with the foundation is that no one has a clear structured vision of how things should be organized.  \n\nWe can immediately throw out the centralized model as that is total failure.    In the case of decentralized models, even totally decentralized models, we have to figure out how to do that which is not easy.  Most likely some form of nodal federation is going to be necessary.  The political organization should reflect the nature of the network.    \n\nClearly the Foundation should not control the coders or the standards.  That needs to be written into any foundation that expects to receive funding.  What the foundation should do is represent the community.  If the community is split then the foundation should represent that the community is split.  There should be clear limitations placed on what the foundation can and cannot do.  What the foundation cannot do should be the task of other organizations such as an independent standards committee or an independent group of developers.  \n\nLet's just say we have a tripartate distribution of powers.  Each branch should itself be a nodal federation where no central node has any more power than simply representing the community.  So in each case we have a distributed network of responsibilities that is similar in structure to the bitcoin network itself.\n\nThis respects the nature of the network, prevents the emergence of central control points that are MEGA network vulnerabilities, and leaves power in the hands of a distributed network, while at the same time vesting power to act in the hands of central nodes that have the power to act, but only to the extent that they represent the community.  If any central node ever took an action that did not represent the larger community then they would lose funding and simply not be followed, possibly what might happen to the current Bitcoin foundation.  But we would be lucky if some more sinister group did not step in and fund them which is why their powers need to be limited in the first place.  \n\nAll this is admittedly generalities but it is these that need to be debated until the specifics are generated.

The two may be related only in some special cases, e.g. commodities or mass-produced industrial products.

The market cap is neither the amount of money that was invested into the system, nor the amount of money that could be made by the holders if they tried to sell them.  \n\nThe net amount of money that people have invested buying bitcoins (minus the net amount that others made by selling them) must be some fraction of the market cap.  That amount went to the miners, as their costs or their profits.  It could be easily estimated, multiplying the daily issuance by the day's average price.

Depending on how willing one is to play fast and loose with the numbers, one can try to take the sales of that piece of software, apply Microsoft\'s P/E ratio to it, and roughly estimate a "market cap" for that specific piece of software.  Bitcoin, on the other hand is free to use, i.e. has no sales.  In a sense it has no *market* value, but is a mechanism by which one can store and transmit tremendous value.\n\nThe difference being that in the first scenario, it\'s like valuing the worth of a retail chain store or a bank.  In the second scenario, it\'s like valuing the worth of the *inventory* being held by a retail chain store, or the *deposits* of a bank.  They\'re not easily comparable.  The deposits of Bank A are not easily comparable to the market cap of retail chain store B.\n\n\nI see what you\'re getting at by drawing the comparison and it\'s kind of a fun thought-experiment, but tough to gleam any real data out of.\n\n\nYou\'d have to take the *free-ness* out of bitcoin to draw the comparison.  The question would then be how much would the Bitcoin client sell for, if it were closed-source, patented, without any of the current altcoins, and owned by a corporation with the means to defend it, legally and politically, and champion in its use via ads, etc?  Then you\'d have to compare that to something like the market cap of MS Windows itself, excluding the rest of MS\'s products and their expected future earnings.\n\nAll said, Bitcoin wouldn\'t be worth much in that context, just as TCP/IP or SMTP wasn\'t worth anything upon its introduction (or even 6 years after its introduction, (to more closely compare it to Bitcoin)).

In our testing, all of them required some custom configuration to block non-consensual trackers. Several of these extensions have business models that we weren\'t entirely comfortable with. And EFF hopes that by developing rigorous algorithmic and policy methods for detecting and preventing non-consensual tracking, we\'ll produce a codebase that could in fact be adopted by those other extensions, or by mainstream browsers, to give users maximal control over who does and doesn\'t get to know what they do online.': 3, 'That is what Coinkite offers with [multisig, including the option to generate any/all keys offline](http://blog.coinkite.com/post/102291566521)': 2, '[deleted]': 3, 'me foo!': 2, 'You should also check: \n\nHTTPS Everywhere - force secure connections\n\nPrivacy Badger  - manage 3rd party cookies \n\n\xc2\xb5Block - remove trackers, ads, social widgets that track you': 8, "Very good!

Perhaps you simply take the top 100 contributors from that list and make them all "key holders" of the threshold sig. Everyone has one vote and you need 51 of 100 to release the funds on a quarterly/semi-annual basis. It\'d be pretty obvious to the dev community if a malicious attacked tried to spam the Git repo.

People often call Mike Hearn a Bitcoin Core developer, but his contributions to that particular project (Bitcoin Core) have been limited to a couple of small and mostly trivial patches a couple years ago-- Instead, he is the main developer of BitcoinJ; but is BitcoinJ less deserving of support? Is it more deserving of support? Since it\'s a separate project with almost no developer overlap, how should support be split between them?-- since it\'s used inside several smartphone wallets it probably has a lot more users, OTOH it\'s just a SPV node (well the supported part of it), so the whole network literally cannot run on it, it\'s dependent on full nodes.\n\nSometimes people say things that others don\'t agree with.

Should people funding things be stuck paying for people they strongly disagree with? Should developers have to self censor their own views to avoid enraged mobs trying to get them off the payment rolls?\n\nLots of hard questions.\n\n> I guess it all comes down to whether such a human-based democratic process would put too much pressure/work/stress/etc on the devs?\n\nOr create bad incentives, like people who become active simply because they want to take over the process to get the funds; or even just the suspicion, it\'s one more thing to be critical about a new contributor:  Are they competent, are they knowledgeable, are they careful, are they trying to slip in back doors, are they trying to raid the funds?\n\n> ask him to send some of his funds over to the threshold address\n\nIt\'s weird that you assume that he has any funds to send over.

How much electricity would be consumed mining?', 0): {'As to whether it\'s possible to make it more efficient, the answer in terms of general security is no. \n\nEfficiency = Efficacy / Cost\n\nOr in this case:\n\nEfficiency = Security of the network / Electricity used\n\nPhrased to make the point clearest, we can write:\n\nEfficiency = Electricity required to attack the network / Electricity used\n\nLowering the cost without lowering efficacy *would* be an efficiency gain, but the last equation should make it clear this is a nonsensical endeavor in proof of work, because the numerator and denominator of the right side of the equation are inextricably linked. Since anyone can participate in mining and there are no privileged participants*, the amount of electricity required to pull off a successful attack is always going to move in lockstep with the total amount of electricity used. That is, efficacy increases and decreases in lockstep with cost. Thus efficiency as far as securing all the transactions is always roughly constant. \n\nHowever, we can say that if the maximum number of transactions are not being processed the system is operating at lower efficiency than it could be. But when the whole world is using it, the network is processing all the transactions in the world, so barring alien civilizations it is working at maximum efficiency by all measures.\n\n*This becomes important when you look at non-PoW systems, such as Proof of Stake, where we can see that some privilege must be granted and so far a kind of centralized checkpointing system has always been required. The generalized criticism against PoS, as a heuristic, is that "a network where anyone can join and no one is privileged leaves no way to determine who is \'honest\' and who is not; therefore the network operates on pure brute force and hence must be as roughly as expensive to maintain as it is to attack, so all such systems devolve back to roundabout PoW."

It would be nice to get an aprox number, but i guess that's a hard question to answer": 2, 'One of the biggest misconceptions about Bitcoin is that the mining is "powering" the payment system, and that more mining power is required to process more payments. This is part of the more general misconception that Bitcoin is mainly a payment system. Bitcoin is, by value, mainly a money system for holding wealth, like Gold 2.0. What mining is actually powering, and what additional mining power correlates with, is how much value is being secured by the network, something like the total "market cap" of Bitcoin.\n\nAs the market cap grows and Bitcoin becomes trusted for bigger and bigger transactions, the amount of money that could be made in a double-spend grows, so the mining power needs to grow to maintain sufficient difficulty to thwart such attacks. Fortunately, as market cap grows the mining reward value also grows, which incentivizes more mining, and the process thereby maintains adequate difficulty.\n\nIf the whole world used Bitcoin, then the amount of electricity used for mining should work out to somewhere in the ballpark of how much electricity some fraction of the global money supply (the amount of money that could be made on a double-spend) could buy. \n\nYou might think that\'s billions of dollars worth of electricity every ten minutes, but I doubt people would do billion-dollar transactions with only a few confirmations, so I would guess something more on the order on millions of dollars of electricity every ten minutes.

Mining is a voluntary activity based on the economics of the process for the individual miner. If more miners elect to mine (global hash rate increases), the Bitcoin protocol adjusts difficulty upwards such that a new block is found on average about every 10 minutes, and total power consumption rises. If fewer miners choose to mine (global hash rate decreases), difficulty gets adjusted downwards (again to maintain the 10 minute average block time), and total energy consumption falls.  \n\nThere's no mechanism in the Bitcoin protocol to monitor or manipulate efficiency in terms of power use per transaction. If Bitcoin employed a different consensus strategy, it might consume less energy in total, but personally I haven't heard of another that is convincingly superior without compromising security and/or decentralization. If one is developed in the future and assuming a community consensus is reached on the new system's superiority, Bitcoin can in theory hard fork to a new consensus protocol.": 2}, ("Creative thinking time.

': 4, 'That might be one way to do it, but my visions of /r/FairShare revolve around Bitcoin.\n\nThe concept itself is currency agnostic though and people are exploring other options.\n\nCheck us out at /r/GetFairShare': -2, '>The exact order and the content of documents is proven by math on any timestamp in future history.\n\nAnd how exactly is math going to prove the legitimacy or accuracy of information in this context?\n\nLets say that this morning Russia launches 300 rockets aimed at california, starts world war III. Russia claims the launch was a per-emptive defense maneuver as its just learned of a coup against the country and a assassin had just tried to take putin\'s life the prior evening.\n\nHow is math, or storing the data on the blockchain going to improve the *accuracy* of the data over history? I get the time stamping bit, that provides proof of existence of a said document at a specific time, but proof of existence does not add any *accuracy*.\n\nThink of wikileaks. Think of snowden and theguardian. Did they need the blockchain to provide accurate highly sensitive information? No, they only needed to be a reputable source. The blockchain is not inherently reputable, it is merely a database. Even if you put something in the blockchain, the data needs to be verified before it can be proven to be factually true. \n\nIn this example we would have a unlimited amount of websites all publishing reports, media outlets, etc from all around the world recording the statements from various governments, actions taken, times that actions were taken, etc.\n\nHow would inputting that data into the blockchain be any different than the data existing outside the blockchain, and how would that data prove to be *more accurate*? I keep stressing accuracy because the supposed benefit of blockchain based historical recording would be having data that is not *manipulable*....but what is to stop people from putting data that is *not factually correct* into the blockchain as a counter opinion to the \'facts\' ? \n\n>When applied consistent (frequently without gaps), transparent (public archives) and precise (detailed) it makes false claims much harder especially to the party that has no blockchain proof the time when actual events occured.\n\nWe already have the most frequent, transparent and precise data storage available as it is now: Totally and completely decentralized, spread across webservers that exist in the entire globe.  Storing data in the blockchain on the other hand would be a *central* storage mechanism, despite the inherent nature of the blockchain being decentralized. You see, choosing one place to store information, regardless of how that information is spread out, still makes the storage of information centralized, as you are choosing to specifically store it there and not other places. Wikipedia for example is a centralized storage database, even though it rides on a decentralized backbone, aka \'the internets\'.\n\nHaving a proof of time for when events occured means nothing to the factual accuracy of the events, only the *time* that it occured. You see where I am constantly leading with this? The type of storage mechanism does not alter the validation process of the data. The burden of proof still exists no matter how you store data, and having a time stamp does not change the fact that the burden of proof must still exist, the data must still be able to be *independently verifiable* as would anything else using *the scientific method*.\n\nUsing the blockchain does not instantly make everything that goes into it true, and the data must still be able to be independently verifiable in order for it to be taken as \'the truth\'.\n\n>So it all comes down that fake evidence is hard to construct in a consistent way.\n\nAnd how hard would it be for me to construct fake evidence and insert it into the blockchain? How hard would it be for the DEA, FBI, CIA, interpool, MI5, etc ? They would just as easily be able to create counter intelligence to contradict your \'facts\' that you wish to order into the blockchain, creating the same false trails, the same misleading intentions, the same casting of doubt onto your \'facts\'.\n\nThe *only* thing that has plausible usage with regards to information being stored in the blockchain is simply a proof of existence timestamp. That "X" occured on or before "Y" as we know it existed in the blockchain at "Y". But that does NOT mean that the information is *true*, or that the event occured at a specific time, only *before* "Y"\n\nSince this keeps on coming up as a \'big picture\' idea, I think its a good time for discussion on the topic whether its even a \'big idea\' or not. Recently James D\'Angelo proposed the same idea on his youtube channel, see his most recent video [A million killer apps part 2] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=Uci0Df7zO8c#t=927) , I\'ve put the URL to the exact part where he talks about using the blockchain as a historical data record.\n\n/u/worldbitcoinnetwork - thoughts on this James? I know you covered using the blockchain as a record keeper in your video, but I believe some of the opinions I\'ve posted here go outside the video and is good information to debate.

And when it comes to bitcoin the ones that want to see adoption is mostly the customers - so we should accept unfavourable price - and if the merchant want to promote bitcoin instead of card they should give a favorable price - but never _never_ try to force a marchent to give you a favorable price just because you want to use bitcoin.': 12, "Plus we'll throw in one free chargeback!": 2, 'Merchant here.\n\nWhy should I subsidize your exchange fees?

If we really want to believe that, then we have to recognize that it *costs money* to train employees on accepting Bitcoin, however as OP in that thread said, *they were the first person to try to spend Bitcoin*. \n\nSo what incentive does a merchant have to adopt a new currency, train all their employees on how to use it, work with their accountant and board to get the logistics of accepting a new currency worked out, only to find that *there is no one (sorry, I mean one person) using it as a currency*.\n\nSo to ask them to, on top of all of this, to provide an *additional* discount for your Bitcoin, is a little much to ask.\n\n\nOh, and on the subject of "cost of acceptance": I ran an A/B test [similar to Mozilla](https://fundraising.mozilla.org/bitcoin-donations-to-mozilla-17-days-in/) and saw very similar results: By prominently displaying Bitcoin acceptance on my site I was *losing* 5.8% of my gross sales.

So basically, you are asking them to make an investment now with the hope of saving in the future.\n\nHowever, there are multiple (obvious) issues wrong with your proposal. I will point out the biggest one of all: Credit cards will still exist even if bitcoin becomes standard.\n\nCredit cards exists because they are convenient, they offer protection, and they allow people to easily make purchases which they can pay back later. CCs can be denominated in dollars, euros, or, yes, bitcoin. Notice how there are bitcoin-based debit cards around?\n\nIt's rather silly, but you're asking merchants to take on a lot of risk at a great cost all in order to do something which won't happen.\n\nIf the CC cost is really that significant to a merchant, there's a far easier way for them to get rid of it: Simply stop accepting credit cards. But they won't do that and you know why? Because (and this is one of the big issues with your proposal) credit cards increases sales for most merchants.": 9, "There's actually a real easy fix for that.\n\nAll you need to do is go back to the purchasing options and select the credit/debit/paycard option.

If merchants are willing to provide a small subsidy on the exchange rate (eg 0.5%), then people could spend Bitcoin without incurring extra costs and a lot more would start doing so. It would still be a major benefit to merchants after it scales up since you would avoid the 2-3% fee that CCs charge.

CASEY\nApril 5, 2015 2:50 p.m. ET\n\nSome of the U.S.\xe2\x80\x99s biggest proprietary traders and investors are testing the waters for a bigger move into bitcoin, giving a potential boost to the fledgling virtual-currency industry.\n\nWhile still cautious of becoming exposed to \xe2\x80\x9ccryptocurrencies,\xe2\x80\x9d some of the firms, which trade with their own money on their own behalf, say they see potential for big profits in trading bitcoin as more investors enter the market and financial-services firms use the currency to streamline transactions.\n\nTheir involvement could help reduce volatility in the market for bitcoin, which has struggled to gain legitimacy in part because of concerns about wild swings in its price.\n\nAmong the companies at the forefront of this move is DRW Holdings LLC, a high-frequency trading firm in Chicago founded by former options-pit trader Donald Wilson in 1992. DRW is a founding investor in a new bitcoin financial-services firm called Digital Asset Holdings that launched last month. Cumberland Mining & Materials LLC, a DRW subsidiary, has \xe2\x80\x9cbegun to experiment with cryptocurrency trading,\xe2\x80\x9d DRW said.\n\nOther firms with large proprietary trading groups also appear to have an appetite for greater exposure to bitcoin.\n\nCitadel Securities LLC in Chicago and KCG Holdings Inc. in Jersey City, N.J., were among a small group of firms that have offered bids to buy shares of the Bitcoin Investment Trust since it listed last month on the OTC Markets, a platform typically used for trading shares of smaller companies that aren\xe2\x80\x99t as heavily regulated as stocks listed on exchanges.\n\nThe trust holds bitcoin in a fund that issues shares to wealthy investors accredited by the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nKCG spokeswoman Sophie Sohn said that in addition to the engagement with the trust, her firm is \xe2\x80\x9cactively exploring various opportunities related to\xe2\x80\x9d bitcoin. Citadel said it was not involved in Bitcoin apart from the bids offered for the trust, a spokesman said.\n\nWedbush Securities, another firm that has made offers to buy shares of the trust, saw it as \xe2\x80\x9ca good place to get your feet wet\xe2\x80\x9d with bitcoin, said Gil Luria, a payment analyst at the Los Angeles-based investment bank.\n\nLaunched by an unidentified software coder in January 2009, bitcoin is a digital currency that is created, or \xe2\x80\x9cmined,\xe2\x80\x9d by computers.\n\nAdvocates believe it will transform how people buy and sell goods and transfer money across the globe. But its rise has been plagued by concerns about a lack of security, criminal usage and price volatility. While it is accepted by an estimated 100,000 merchants world-wide, its use by mainstream consumers remains limited.\n\nInvestment in bitcoin and related digital currency-based businesses has surged in recent months, in part reflecting bets by venture capitalists and other investors on several noncurrency uses for the technology that underlies bitcoin. Various applications are under development that aim to strip out middlemen from the financial system and enhance record keeping and transparency in the broader economy.\n\nOne persistent problem for the bitcoin market is it can be hard to trade because there aren\xe2\x80\x99t enough buyers and sellers at exchanges. Executives at those exchanges have sought to persuade high-frequency trading firms to begin making markets in bitcoin, trading-firm executives said.\n\nIn market making, a trading firm offers both bids and offers for an asset so that investors always have a willing party with which to trade. The trading firm tries to capture the spread between the bids and offers, buying at a slightly cheaper price and selling at a slightly higher price.\n\nAri Rubenstein, co-founder of Global Trading Systems Inc. in New York, said his team is looking at how to trade bitcoin but is waiting for regulators to give a signal that they approve of it.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo one has an idea if bitcoin is going to take off and be unbelievable, but everyone agrees it has that potential,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut we are still weighing the risks of getting involved.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nUntil now, New York broker-dealer SecondMarket Inc., a pioneer in trading alternative securities such as private-company shares, has been the largest institutional market maker.\n\nThe firm, which launched the Bitcoin Investment Trust in 2013, said it has traded almost 800,000 bitcoins valued at more than $300 million since its founding.\n\nWhile there has been a higher level of interest in bitcoin from institutional investors, including hedge funds and proprietary traders, there are still a number of challenges for the market to overcome before those players can get more heavily involved, said SecondMarket director Michael Moro.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne is that at a $3.5 billion market cap, it is still a small place for traditional large money institutional guys to make markets,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cTwo, liquidity is scattered\xe2\x80\x9d across exchanges in Hong Kong, Europe and the U.S.\n\nFor firms to get more engaged in trading bitcoin directly on a large scale, it will require more sophisticated exchange infrastructure and regulatory certainty, said Charles Cascarilla, chief executive officer of ItBit Pte.

Then updates are deployed to make sure no nodes will _introduce_ a discrepancy with the fixed rules, but they will continue to accept these discrepancies if they show up in the blockchain, until a strong super majority of the hashpower is indicating via flags in blocks that when a strong supermajority of the hashpower indicates so that they will no longer allow the the discrepancy and instead enforce the new rule.  Long after the new rule is imposed by most of the network, the conditional logic can be removed, and all that remains is the new rule that enforces the fix.\n\nThis process is called a soft-fork, and there is one going on right now, called [BIP66](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0066.mediawiki) which has about 18% of the network hashpower currently signaling its intent to enforce.\n": 3, '[**@aantonop**](https://twitter.com/aantonop/)\r\n\r\n> [2015-04-05 22:26 UTC](https://twitter.com/aantonop/status/584844688382889984)\r\n\r\n> @Xentagz Consensus development is a completely new field of software engineering.

Price goes up again, his hate grows, and so do his efforts to attack Bitcoin and convince people to not using it. And so on and so forth.

How would he feel if he invested now, after years of predicting its failure, and Bitcoin ended up failing? Like the biggest idiot ever. That scares him to death. So instead, he tries to force his prophecy to become a reality.\n\nWhat mentally healthy people would do: Either ignore Bitcoin or invest in it.\n\nWhat people like patio11 do: Spend their days hating on a technology and trying to make it fail, because they can't afford (the mental damage of) seeing it succeed knowing they could have invested in it.": 8, 'All that generic-ness in and of itself implies enormous complexity.\n\nPlus you cannot have consensus _itself_ by the subject of your gnomic rule or else you have an ouroboros...

There is just too much other important technical work to be done in the world for anyone competent to work in this space to justify working on something that eats away at their soul.\n\n(This also highlights a way that less technically involved people can help out: By providing moral support and communications management aid to people doing the heavy lifting.)\n\n> we noticed it when one dev introduced a controversial yet really minor change\n\nThe Gentoo package spammed your console at install time with notices about what it was doing and a URL.

Hence why buttcoiners gloat when the price is going down.\n\nHumans do this all the time.

The issue there is fundamental.

Having something like 30% of the hashpower enforcing different rules would result in huge reorganizations, transactions reaching 6 confirms and then becoming unconfirmed/conflicted, enabling users to get robbed. Even if the discrepancy is only 5%-- if you're a user in that 5% the disagreement with the network is potentially fatal to _you_ even if the rest of the network goes along fine.\n\nThe same process occurs elsewhere, W3C went off into space with the XHTML efforts producing a specification which had little/no relationship with the real world, wasn't compatible with the existing web, or easily implemented in existing implementations. It was largely ignored, and later HTML5 was created to specify what people were actually doing.  This was in the context of the web, where a bit of incompatibility here and there doesn't make the whole system stop doing what its supported to do.\n\nUltimately, its what the actual participants in the system do that matters. Not some developers, not some dead tree specification. The purpose is to build a realtime consensus, and the integrity of the consensus is almost always more important than its correctness in an abstract sense.

This will exacerbate inflation. This is a dollar-commodity crash.\n\nOnce there is push back from the general masses, the nations will wish their currency wasn\'t worth less, or worthless. Social services will teeter on collapse because it will be easier to live on perpetual unemployment than to find a job (funemployment). Gov\'ts\' only recourse is to start "printing" to pay for social programs and the unfunded liabilities on the balance sheet.\n\nThe macro-decision to "print" will trigger spiraling inflation in commodities, as folks discover the huge value gap between equities (stocks) and commodities (food,water,shelter,oil). This striking difference will make it abundantly clear that the Haves only have fiats and ledgers, while the Havenots supply/produce the commodities. This will be the crash, as the Haves will rush to buy commodities before their equities become worthless. How much wheat will your Facebook stock certificate buy?\n\nWhat I want to know is why we didn\'t collapse yesterday or last year? I could spend the whole day creating a list of the reasons why it will crash, but I\'m hard pressed to define why it hasn\'t.

This is a buzzword without clear definition. How do you define "state-sponsored crypto-currency"? In how far is it same/different to bitcoin? For example: Would the state have the power to change the protocol at will (like max. money cap, black-listing addresses)? Would the block-confirmation be done by decentralized non-state-controlled miners? Would the state still have the power to overrule and not accept some otherwise regularly mined blocks?  \n\nAfter you have defined all this in detail, please explain in detail why it would still be of interest for a state to issue such a "crypto-currency". Otherwise, this talk about state-sponsored crypto-currencies is just nonsense.\n\nDid you think of this yourself, or are you just writing it because the idea of state-issued crypto-currencies have been expressed and re-iterated so often elsewhere, and since it was re-iterated so often, it must be a good idea?\n\n> The dollar will crash before 2020\n\nPlease define "crash". Note that some people say it has crashed already, some say the crash was 1971 when the gold standards was ended, others say it\'s a continuous crash because it has lost >90% (99%?) of value over the  last 100 years, while yet others say because this is so continuous, it is not actually a crash, and since the devaluation will continue to be gradually, there will never be something like a "crash" (= *sudden* drop in value) of the USD. So please specify how you define "crash of the USD", by measurable terms. As an example, personally I would define "crash" as a loss of value by more than 50% in one year in comparison to average currency basket like "SDR w/o USD", or in comparison to GDP of USA, i.e. a USD dollar crash would mean that the US GDP, measured in USD, would increase by >100% in one year. According to that definition, I tend to believe that there will never be a crash of the USD, because it will continue to devaluate just gradually and not suddenly. If you think otherwise, please elaborate why, and how exactly *you* define "crash".\n\n> The technological portion [of Bitcoin] is done.\n\nNo, not at all. If every person on earth adopted Bitcoin today, the Bitcoin capacity would be just enough such that every person on earth could perform one Bitcoin transaction once every 100 years! On average! That\'s today\'s technical limitation of the Bitcoin protocol! So Bitcoin yet needs to scale. Also the long-term stability of the network, as block reward decreases, yet has to be proven. Will the POW mechanism suffice? OR will we need other layers of protection, like net of trust, to avoid 51% attacks in the future? This is a very technical question yet unsolved. So the technological portion of Bitcoin is not done at all. I am not saying it is unsolvable, but saying that nothing needs to be done anymore just reflects a very superficial view of the matter.\n\n> You better get your ass on the bitcoin standard as soon as possible.\n\nYou better educate yourself first and first get your thoughts (like definitions of terms) clear.': -1, "> The dollar will crash before 2020, and though I don't believe anyone can predict exactly when that will happen\n\nIt will when Yellen will raise official bank rate.": 1, ' I get Bitcoin Gift cards from Prepaid Bitcoin. www.prepaidbitco.in\n': -1, 'Spoiler alert: Get psychiatric help before you do something you regret': -1, "You aren't helping this person who likely has bipolar disorder by encouraging this type of behavior.": 1, "Agreed, I realized my error too late.  \n  \nA few hard forks with some upgrades and concessions and the virus will mutate into something even more invincible.  \n  \nThat's right, double invincibility.  \n  \nGetting a Mario star, *while you already have a Mario star* and turning into Golden Sonic the Hedgehog.  \n  \nFuck you, Doctor Bowser Robotnik.   \n  \nThe obvious conclusion should be that it is highly advantageous to own coins prior to any forks.": 12, 'uppegasused': 11, 'I don\'t believe "the" conspiracies.\n\nBut anyway - why did you post it here?
