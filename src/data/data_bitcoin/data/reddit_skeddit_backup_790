': 3, "Thank you for the feedback.  When I start collecting data, I plan on presenting this concept to businesses to hear their thoughts, and to find out if they would adopt such an idea, if it were available to them.  Where I work, open source software is all but banned, yet they recently said that we need to save 6 million dollars at the site where I work, this fiscal year.  I don't know what our software licensing fees are, but I suspect that we could save A LOT if we switched to open source equivalents, and just donated to them instead of paying mandatory licensing fees. The idea for my dissertation came from the fact that the Document Foundation is based in Europe.  If my employer decided to save money by switching to LibreOffice, then Bitcoin would be a very convenient way of sending donations to them.  Now, imagine that businesses decided to do this en masse.  This would be a logical decision because improvements to LibreOffice could benefit all of them, and allow all of them to make the switch.  This concept would be most applicable to open source projects that are headquartered in a different nation than the corporation using the software.  However, Bitcoin would also be a convenient way for a U.S. based company to pay Red Hat, or any another domestic open source company.  At the beginning of the fiscal year, the company would buy enough Bitcoin to fund their software donations for the entire year.  Even if the price of Bitcoin goes down, the NUMBER of Bitcoins that they send would remain the same. So the company can more accurately predict their expenses.  \n\nHere is an example: if the company's profit dropped from $20 million in FY 2013 to $15 million in FY 2014 (assume that the price of BTC remains constant in both years), then they would buy 15/20 the amount of bitcoins in 2014 that they bought in 2013 for donations to open source software projects that they use. However, Microsoft, and other similar proprietary software companies, will expect the same licensing fees in both years. ": 1, 'You normally write the abstract last.': 3, 'I see this being integrated into Bitcoin itself about 10 years from now. It could technically be done sooner, but there will be far more research done in that timeframe on scalability, network topology optimization, efficiency of the P2P communication part of the protocol, Zero-knowledge proofs, compression techniques, pruning and more. \n\nMy own ideal goal for Bitcoin requires a fair bit of progress to be viable. \n\nBut today it works perfectly fine to use Namecoin and let miners merge-mine it with Bitcoin.': 1, 'Namecoin registration, plus various organizations (also registered on Namecoin) maintaining their own lists of which of the projects on the Namecoin blockchain is considered trusted.\n\nSo you tell your software which organizations you trust, and it lists which projects that they have approved.

Would businesses be willing to:\n\n* Switch to open source software.\n* Support open source software through direct peer-to-peer BTC donations.\n\nSecondly, would open source software developers be open to some sort of central registry where businesses could find them reliably (another idea that I have been toying around with is a sidechain-based registry where open source software developers would pay trusted registry companies to verify that they indeed own a particular software project, ad have the knowledge and credentials to deliver what the open source software promises (perhaps including technical support).': 3, "Your 'gut feelings' may not be the best thing to base your PhD thesis on.\n\n> The quality  of open source software sucks because guys are developing it on their free time\n\nThat's a rather sweeping and uninformed statement. I would hardly say that the Linux kernel sucks. Firefox, LaTeX, Vim, gcc, KVM, Wireshark are just a few incredibly good open source products that I use almost daily. Sure, there's also a lot of open source software around that isn't all that polished, but there is also a lot of closed sourced software around that is utter crap. Furthermore, it's not just 'guys', and a lot of developers are actually paid to work on open source nowadays.\n\n> the fact that the people in executive positions who make software acquisition decisions fall into one of these categories\n\nThat is not a 'fact' but again your gut feeling, and a rather sweeping generalization of executives. I have plenty of counter examples to that assertion from my own experience.\n\nYou need to research your premise that open source has a 'funding problem'. Because in many ways, it doesn't. Signing up to your proposed system of donations comes at a price: open source projects then have to deal with bookkeeping, taxes, refunding, interacting with your proposed 'reputation system', and the rather hairy problem of distributing funds within their project. Part of the reason that open source can be free (as in gratis) is that it eschews all these complications. And because of this, the production costs stay low enough that they can afford to give their effort away. Although 'giving away' is not the main reason that Open Source gets created, it just ends up in this curious position in the economical parameter space where free can mean both 'libre' and 'gratis'.\n\nThere certainly are open source projects that are lacking resources. But 'funding' is is not the only possible way of addressing that issue, and not necessarily the best. Companies can (and already do) support Open Source projects by donating other things, such as bandwidth, server capacity, and most importantly, their patches.\n\nPeople, and businesses, can already contribute to Open Source projects. Some do, in various ways, but a majority doesn't. The Open Source projects that do feel they need funds can already set up a PayPal or Bitcoin donations page. You are drawing up this convoluted, technically complex system to manage reputations, donations and features-for-pay. Even if your idea worked, I doubt it would be beneficial. By turning 'reputation' into a single numerical rating, you think you make everyone's world easier. But attempting to simplify the world into a one dimensional metric often has very negative effects. Bad actors will try and game that system. Just look at how keeping track of academic citation indices went from a useful tool to something that is heavily abused. Or look at Google's 'Page Rank' algorithm and how many junk websites and Wordpress hacks have been created because of it. If any such metric is successful, it seems to always become a case of the tail wagging the dog in the end.\n\nThe OpenSSL project can publish their Bitcoin address just fine without it being included in the Bitcoin client. Despite doing it in a distributed fashion, you are trying to create a central register where none is needed.  Companies that do reputation vetting, developers who have to pay to have their reputations evaluated? What this seems to accomplish most of all is a new flow of money away from the developers to a group of people who have nothing to do with the creation of open source software. Instead of helping, you are adding inefficiencies. \n\nFinally, going from 'open source software sucks', via 'executives are evil/stupid and resisting open source' to a situation where 'the average corporate executive' is now paying for this apparently inferior software that he doesn't want to have, using one of the most controversial open source products, requires too many leaps of imagination. Your proposal is full of holes, which seem to be paved with wishful thinking.\n": 1, "Having read all this hear I feel like you didn't devote enough time for the open-source vs. proprietary question and jumped right to the effects bitcoin would have on open-source.\n\nFor example, your implicit assumption that open-source projects depend on 'donations' limits your research unnecessarily. Also sentences like this\n\n> The quality of open source software sucks because guys are developing it on their free time\n\nindicate that you haven't properly studied the 'industrial organization aspects' of open-source firms competing with proprietary firms.\n\nIn fact, being open-source may be rationalized with profit maximization without depending on donations and quality might be higher given the right circumstances. I think you might want to have a look at [Llanes & Elejalde (2012). Industry equilibrium with open-source and proprietary firms](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167718712000987).\n\nGood luck. :-)": 1, "Out of a total of 17 lines, you use 6-7 lines to start with an analogy. Don't do that with an abstract, it's supposed to be a summary. Keep the anecdotes and analogies for the introduction. \n\nCurrently your flow of ideas is as follows and it's too janky:\n- Bebop analogy, patrons \n- Open source is good for businesses\n- Open source software developers have trouble with funding\n- Bitcoin can help\n\nThat actually says extremely little about the premiss of your dissertation, and you basically only introduce the topic in the last sentence of your abstract. That means that there's simply very little to critique because the abstract doesn't elaborate on the argument why and how Bitcoin plays an 'essential role in open source software patronage'.  Crowd-funding (kickstarter) and patronage (patreon) already exists in the traditional payment system. What does Bitcoin offer in this case that fiat doesn't? Going by the title, that's where your focus should be, summarizing your arguments. ": 16, 'Thank you. That is EXTREMELY valuable feedback.  The abstract is a work in progress, and I am certain that the final version will be very different than this one.': 3, 'That makes sense.': 1, 'I just got off of the phone with my research advisor.  I discussed with him the direction in which I\'m going. He warned me that I have to be careful not the lead the interviewees to the answer that I want to hear.  So I\'ll probably delete this thread before I even start my research. Thank goodness that my Reddit identity is anonymous.  I don\'t want my subjects to know what my position is.  Everything that I have posted here is tentative.  The title, the abstract, everything may change once I get the results.  My gut tells me that businesses would switch to open source projects, and they would help to fund those projects, but I think that what is holding this back is the fact that the people in executive positions who make software acquisition decisions fall into one  of these categories:\n\n* They don\'t know about open source software alternatives.\n* They don\'t trust open source software alternatives.\n\nMy gut also tells me that it\'s a chicken and the egg problem: the quality of open source software sucks because guys are developing it on their free time.  Bitcoin COULD give them a reliable source of funding, but businesses don\'t trust that model, especially when they associate Bitcoin with the Silk Road, scams, failed exchanges etc. Also, how do they know that the developer won\'t just collect the bitcoins, and never work on the project.  So I think that 2 things need to develop: a patronage payment system based on Bitcoin, and a registry where open source software developers would pay to have their reputations evaluated.  The two would be combined in a way that would allow a business to log in to a website, see which open source projects are trusted, which developers are trusted, and the directory would allow the company to link with the developer, get his or her Bitcoin address, and then send funds to held fund the continued development of the project.\n\nI envsion a completely decentralized solution where the directly was built into the Bitcoin protocol itself.  Registry companies would all of the vetting work, and they would share the results with miners.  Miners would then add the registry information to a Bitcoin sidechain.  Then, when I open my Bitcoin client (this could be built into all of them), I would have a directory tab where I could search for projects, find their official Bitcoin address(es),  communicate with them, and set up doing business.  For example, the new Bitcoin sidechain would have an associated email client that would be a new tab in the Bitcoin client.  If Google wanted to fund a specific feature added to OpenSSL (this is probably a bad example because Google has other channels, but it will illustrate the idea), they would open a Bitcoin client, search for "OpenSSL", and the name of the project lead would come up, along with the official Bitcoin address of the project.  Google would write up a proposal, and send it off.  The lead developer would reply, and cite the cost.  Google would agree, send half the BTC up front, and the second half when the project is done.  I know that Bitcoin 2.0 projects are doing this sort of thing with smart contracts,  but this makes it even more confusing.  You now have to discover a completely new come, you have to learn how smart contracts work in that coin etc.  \n\nBitcoin is already known, so I\'d rather see some build a simple registry interface into Bitcoin with its own sidechain.  They need to build it not for geniuses with PhDs in computer science, but in a way that the average corporate executive could immediately understand it.  Email took off because any human being on the planet can understand almost immediately how it works.  I don\'t think that what I am proposing here will take off until someone builds it in a way that MOST people would immediately get it.\n  So both Bitcoin and open source software have a perception problem, but I suspect that this perception would change very quickly if open source/Bitcoin started to save companies a lot of money.': 1, "As the first half of the abstract has already been addressed, let me say something about the second half.\n\nVendor lock in is not about their services, but their products and data formats. Lock in happens not because you have no access to the underlying program code, but because there is no other software that can work with the data that you have already created, or the hardware you have bought. Open standards are much more important here than open source - if there are multiple software products that can handle the same data, there is no risk of lock in, even if all these products are closed source.\n\nI fail to see how Bitcoin helps with solving your hypothesized funding problem. Bitcoin does have lower costs and 'friction' for international money transfers, but in the end it's just a medium. The real problem with funding for open source software is more of a 'tragedy of the commons' kind of problem. I don't think having an easier way to transmit money will suddenly convince people to start funding open source products.\n\nPerhaps you can even say that one of the strengths of open source software is how it almost entirely unfunded, and therefore less subject to the whims of the end-user (or worse, the interpretation of those whims by a marketing department). People who work on open source software do it because it is important to them. It scratches an itch they have, it solves a problem they have, they enjoy the cooperation. But they hardly ever expect to make any money back on it.\n\nAnother very important aspect of open source is that it is free - free as in freedom. The fact that it is also free to use for your aforementioned business owner is a nice side-effect, but hardly the driving factor for creating open source software.": 2, 'Okay, thank you.  I actually looked at multig escrow a little bit today as I was learning how a 3xxxxxx Bitcoin address is created.': 1, "Look up multisignature escrow / arbitration (bitrated.com), crowfunding style anyone-can-pay scripts, timelock scripts (nlocktime), multisignature wallets (Bitpay's Copay), etc...

What I don't know, and what will change the final version of the abtract, is if businesses would actually adopt Bitcoin to directly fund open source projects.  Once the dissertation is complete, and I have all of the results from interviews, then I'll go back and rewrite the dissertation based on what I've found.": 1, "**Vendor lock in is not about their services, but their products and data formats. Lock in happens not because you have no access to the underlying program code, but because there is no other software that can work with the data that you have already created, or the hardware you have bought. Open standards are much more important here than open source - if there are multiple software products that can handle the same data, there is no risk of lock in, even if all these products are closed source.**\n\nI agree with almost everything that you said above, but I also think that not having access to source code causes problems.  The fact that I can't access the source code to Microsoft Office makes it impossible for the developers of an open source competitor to make a  completely compatible product.  This is a form of indirect vendor lock-in because Microsoft  (and similar companies) know that a client has no hope of switching if the open source alternative can't create compatible files.  So yes, open protocols are important, but so is accessible source code.\n\n**I fail to see how Bitcoin helps with solving your hypothesized funding problem.**\n\nBusinesses would buy all the Bitcoin that they need for purchases/donations at the beginning of the fiscal year.  You can't do this with credit.   They would buy the amount of bitcoins that they could afford based on their fiscal health from the previous fiscal year.  They would then donate a proportional dollar amount of bitcoins to the open source projects that are beneficial to their business.  Bitcoin would allow them to do this regardless of where the open source project is located. In FY_A, where they had a $100 million profit, the company would buy $1,000,000 worth of Bitcoin; in FY_B, where they had a $90 million profit, they would buy $0.9 million worth of Bitcoin.  In FY_B, the open source project would just have to try to do the same with less.\n\n**Perhaps you can even say that one of the strengths of open source software is how it almost entirely unfunded.**\n\nIn principle, I agree 100%. However, in practice, open source software still has some serious quality issues.  I am writing my dissertation in LibreOffice on an Centos system, and LO has crashed more than 10 times today alone (the document is in .odt format).  The document is long and complex, and LibreOffice is not up to the task (as much as I love it, and the concept behind it).   If 10% of the companies using Microsoft Office switched to LibreOffice, and each of those companies pledged to donate 1% of their annual profit to LO, then the quality of LO would dramatically increase.  Since the Document Foundation is in Germany, Bitcoin would be an ideal way for corporations in other countries to donate to it.\n\n**Another very important aspect of open source is that it is free - free as in freedom. The fact that it is also free to use for your aforementioned business owner is a nice side-effect, but hardly the driving factor for creating open source software.**\n\nPeople would still create open source software for free, but regular funding in the form of Bitcoin donations would allow many of them to dedicate a greater percentage of their time to their projects (how many open source software developers have to write their code after working for 8 hours at an unrelated employer)?\n": 1, 'Hmm, interesting.

This is just my opinion, and perhaps misunderstanding, but Bitcoin has a $4 billion marketcap versus about $8 million for NMC, it would seem to me that it would be easier to get business to buy into Bitcoin with an added registry feature than it would be to get them to buy into Namecoin.

This means that while the interbank rate of ARS/USD might show Bitcoin is being worth double when compared to the black market rate of ARS/USD it shows BTC/ARS being not over valued but just about right.\n\nThis aside there are arbitrage opportunists between countries. I have noticed on European exchanges and many places over seas that there is roughly a 2-3% increase in value than on US and Canadian exchanges. Still this is much smaller of a difference than in Argentine due to the Blue Dollar. \n\nOf course this means huge arbitrage opportunities if you can pull it off. Buy Bitcoin in one coutnry, go to Argentina, sell for Pesos, then bring Pesos bank and exchange for local currency, repeat. Not sure how easy that would be though due to currency controls.

Argentinian people are allowed to use their credit cards to buy stuff in USD. However, there is an associated tax of 35%, meaning that the final rate is the official one + 35%.\n\nAs of today the official rate to USD is around 8.6 ARS. With credit cards the cost goes to 8.6+35% = 11.6. Black market is around 14.3.\n\nBTC is priced at the black market rate. With PayPal you can use your credit card, so there you have the difference.

Honestly though, you don\'t have to take it from me, [here\'s Peter Todd saying the same thing](http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/2e1ijs/gavin_andresen_explains_how_bitcoin_is_very/cjvesd0):\n\n> Bitcoin is not an efficient payment system. It replaces what could be a single centrally managed datacenter with a vast army of miners turning electricity into heat, and thousands of copies of the central ledger. That\'s why the cost per transaction from the inflation subsidy is curently $30USD. The one thing Bitcoin has going for it compared to existing systems is freedom from regulation, and it pays a heavy price to get that.\n\nJust think about it for a second, is it more efficient to update one centralized processor about the validity of a transaction, or to get hundreds of decentralized processors to all agree about the validity of a transaction?': 1, "[We're way ahead of you, OP..](http://www.reddit.com/r/Buttcoin/comments/26vxsm/send_around_some_butts_with_the_actual_buttcoin/)": 5, 'Pppphhht, you think I\'d be here on reddit if the banksters weren\'t printing off a hefty sack of filthy fiat dollars for every day I slow down mass bitcoin adoption!? \n\nBut let me reiterate anyway: it\'s a joke subreddit about butts.

This will allow mining activity to serve as a source of heat in cold climates, or perform work where heat is required.\n\nThis could potentially reverse the centralization of mining devices by making the most economical mining that done by ordinary people utilizing the heat by-product of mining.\n\nIf that were to work (and that's a big if), that would still leave centralization through pools, which exists primarily because miners prefer reduced payout variance.\n\nI believe 'pool sidechains' can largely solve this problem.\n\nThe idea would be this: \n\nYou have several sidechains that exist solely for miners. Miners form P2Pools to mine their sidechain, and earn poolcoins, particular to their sidechain, while merge mining, on behalf of their sidechain, with a Bitcoin P2Pool. The bitcoin rewards paid out to the sidechains by the Bitcoin P2Pool would be claimed by owners of the various poolcoins, who could convert their poolcoins back to bitcoin via the sidecoin -> bitcoin conversion process that sidechain functionality enables.\n\nThis would allow multiple small sub-pools to combine their efforts in one high hashrate P2Pool, to reduce payout variance, without any trusted third parties.\n\n": 10, "Desire to help Bitcoin? If the federated P2Pool scheme gets a large enough percentage of the network hashrate, lower payout variance than the centralized pools? Not having to pay a fee to the centralized pool operator? Yes, they'll have to run full nodes, but thousands of people do that now, and I think there's a big overlap between them and individuals involved in mining, given the latter tend to be more technologically inclined and more deeply involved in Bitcoin than the average Bitcoiner.\n\nI think the biggest incentive to use a centralised pool is the lower variance in payouts. That is why the vast majority of people choose to use larger pools over smaller pools despite both offloading the cost of running a full node to a third party. With mining variance reduced, I believe P2Pool mining would become competitive with centralized mining.\n\nEDIT: WRT security, you're right, that needs to worked out. \n\nEDIT 2: How the security aspect could work is that the pool sidechains would reward poolcoins to two different groups: a small share (e.g. 1 percent) to those who mine the sidechain, and the rest (e.g. 99 percent) to those who contribute hashes on the sidechain's behalf to the Bitcoin P2Pool.

Even with a dozen or so major pools, there are still thousands of individual miners who make individual decisions about which pool to contribute their power / votes.': 10, "They hedge for that by short selling like crazy. A lot of people will leave, but there might still be some left who don't care, and they would then be slowly gouged out over time through the mining.\n\nSeems very profitable to me.": 2, '> If the government of China were to confiscate miners, they couldn\'t do it in secret. Wouldn\'t they run a great risk that all their efforts would just result in a fork, rendering them impotent and foolish looking?\n\nSo, let\'s run through this more carefully. Suppose that the Chinese government wants to attack the Bitcoin network. They could conceivably have one of several motives:\n\n1. They don\'t like cryptocurrency because of { terrorism, belief in economic theories arguing that the existence of unregulated financial tools will lead to extreme financial instability, desire to remove deflationary alternatives to fiat, desire to keep their banks in power, desire to support their own state-backed crypto }\n2. They want to profit from shorting it\n3. They are fine with cryptocurrency, but want control so that they can censor transactions\n\n(2) seems silly, particularly so since any government-scale attempt to profit by shorting-then-attacking (or conversely longing-then-promoting) anything will collapse in on itself due to insider trading. In fact, insider trading will warn us ahead of time that "something big and bad is going to happen soon" regardless of CNgov\'s motives. Thus, ruling out (2), we are left with two motives that are basically both hostile to Bitcoin proper.\n\nNow, CNgov wants to attack. They have the addresses and identities of 50%+ of the Bitcoin network. They have two options:\n\n1. Seize the hardware\n2. Just send them a secret court order NSA-style to install a given software package\n\n(1) I agree will provide early warning; (2) will not do so directly, but as mentioned above attempts to keep it secret will probably collapse in on themselves due to insider trading (particularly, note that Chinese BTC exchanges often let you invest in them, and a sudden hostile stance on BTC would be much worse for those exchanges than for Bitcoin proper, and the insider trading should hurt them even more; all this will be a relatively easily detectable signal).\n\nSo, status: (1) CNgov has control of 60% of mining hardware, (2) the world is aware that "something bad is gonna happen in China". Now, CNgov starts their attack. Suppose the current block number is 323515. The software states "add an extra validity rule that a block is valid iff (i) block.number <= 323515, OR (ii) the block contains 0 transactions that have not been signed by CNgov". Thus, the CNgov-controlled miners will create a chain of empty blocks, and this chain will inevitably eventually defeat any competing chain that contains non-empty blocks.\n\nSo, Bitcoin community sees this, decides to fork. In order to render the CNgov ASIC control meaningless, they would need to switch to something other than SHA256. Now, in a single-chain environment that\'s not too bad; just a few software installs for everyone, although merchants everywhere would experience days of disruption. However, the consensus seems to be that multiple interacting chains is the future, even if we have disagreements over whether the architecture will be centralized at the inter-chain level (ie. Bitcoin is the center of everything) or decentralized (ie. all chains in a roughly power-law-distributed fashion linking to each other with no chain particularly more central than any other).\n\nHence, suppose that Bitcoin needs to switch from SHA256 to SHA3 (or hashimoto, or slasher, or hell why not DPOS). Then, sidechains that verify transactions in the Bitcoin blockchain will also need to hard-fork to substitute the Bitcoin validator inside of them with a new Bitcoin validator that supports the new algo, and the effect could propagate recursively.\n\nNow, if the sidechain validators were designed in such a way that a large consensus of users could modify their code _inside_ the protocol, then that could be a way out, and will at least prevent a situation where Bitcoin gets forked, and then Ethereum decides to fork because people decide the BTC sidechain currency inside of Ethereum is too valuable to let die, and then everyone building internet-of-things tech into their fridges on top of Ethereum has to do a recall, but it will still be a very large effort that could take weeks to properly resolve itself.\n\nAnd then if (1) my hunch that ASIC resistance is possible is incorrect (~50% chance imo) and (2) my hunch that if ASIC resistance is impossible then we\'ll soon see the development of smart compilers that let you create an ASIC for any algo within 2 weeks, and it will all be centralized in China, is correct, then China could just do it again and again.

While you're creating the paper wallet, save it as an image and put it on an unused flash drive. That way if the paper is damaged, you have a digital copy available. \n\nForgetting the password is your greatest threat, next to losing the keys physically. Have a backup at another location.

(The only reason this is considered "more secure" is because in general, people suck at digital security)\n2. Adds a failsafe digital security measure that must be cleared AFTER the physical security has been breached. (So even if someone steals your BIP38 wallet out of your vault, fully knowing how to use it and what it is... they would still need the password)\n\nHowever, there are 2 drawbacks that go hand in hand with the above:\n\n1. You need to think of how to physically secure it. (Only one copy in your house? What if it gets stolen and you have no other copies? What if your house burns down? What if a flood comes and your BIP38 wallet gets wet? etc. etc.)\n2. You need to remember your password. (What if you die? What if you get Alzheimer\'s? What if you mis-typed your password when you made the wallet? etc etc)\n\nSoooo, if you have contingency plans for all possible mishaps and outcomes, THEN you are secure.\n\nFinal lesson: There is no one button solution for security for ANYTHING.': 9, 'Password strength is measured in bits of "entropy". Roughly speaking, each bit of entropy doubles the strength of the password.\n\nWith 26 letters in the alphabet a random lower case letter has 4.7 bits of entropy (2^4.7 = 26), so 15 letters would be 4.7*15 =70 bits. Anything over 60 bits is probably safe against anything less than the NSA, so you would probably be safe.\n\nIf you mix upper and lower case and digits then you have 62 characters, giving almost 6 bits per character, so 15 characters would be almost 90 bits of entropy, which would be very strong.\n\nBut if your passphrase is chosen from English words then the entropy drops to maybe 2 bits per character, giving you a mere 30 bits. I haven\'t done the sums, but that can probably be broken in a few days by a high-end graphics card.\n\nIf the passphrase is a quotation then the entropy drops even further. Its hard to estimate, but you would be somewhere between 10 and 20 bits.\n\nSo it depends.\n\n': 3, ">In 20 years a BIP38 wallet may or may not be supported by anyone.\n\nSince it's open source and widely known how BIP38 works I don't think this would be a problem.\n\nI think memorizing an HD seed is probably even better than either of those options, though.

Their efficiency will in all circumstances undercut operating costs of legit miners, meaning that eventually everyone but them will operate at a loss and will not only force mining to centralise, but the most powerful miners will also be the criminals that operate these botnets, thus putting the security of Bitcoin in the worst possible hands.

GHash and everyone else would switch their operators to P2Pool, and all their hashing power would go with them automatically. (Seeing as changing the operator\'s mining code doesn\'t really affect each miner in the pool)\n\nAlso, here\'s a hint: If someone does a 51% attack, that is not good for Bitcoin at all... even if someone goes on record to say "oh yeah don\'t sell all your bitcoins, we\'re just going to centralize the network real quick so we can DEcentralize it later, mmkay?" it will show that a large number of miners could easily collude to do whatever they want to the network, and thus anyone would look at Bitcoin and think "but Bitcoin has a community of miners that easily group together to move hashing power for political ideals at the drop of a hat... hmmm, sounds like the government.

You should give authorization to such company, here comes the question "**how?**" Multisig is the answer:\n\n* Imagine that GreenAddress.it using multisig in a properly-developed manner, and it knows the web-sites which you allowed to make repetative purchases. GreenAddress has only part of your key (1 of 3 multisig addresses). For allowing repetative purchases you just go to settings in GreenAddress.it & add that web-site to trusted zone. 2nd part of private key you should hold in a secret place yourself. Also there\'s a 3rd part of your private key which goes to RedBox (like in OP\'s case). Now when RedBox requests payment from GreenAddress, first of all GreenAddress looks in its database for personal user\'s account - and **if there\'s such entry saying that user wants this repetative spending** then GreenAddress.it authorizes by signing a transaction which comes from RedBox. Also it gives flexibility - because if you gave to GreenAddress.it limits like (**I don\'t want to spend more than $2000 on RedBox, I want to do it only 1 time per month, only on Sundays, only if the weather is nice, only if THIS, THIS and MANY THINGS PROGRAMMABLE**), and if RedBox trying to do anything that contradicts with your settings, like spending over $2000, then GreenAddress.it ain\'t going to authorize this\n\n* Secondly MultiSig wallets are useful, because they are litterally **removes** the 10 minute bitcoin confirmation. It makes every transaction instant, just because GreenAddress.it won\'t authorize double-spends too, because it knows which funds on the wallets properly arrived & confirmed by Bitcoin network, and it also knows all of your spending attempts & it knows exactly if you\'re trying to **overspend** from non-existent funds.\n\n\nSo MultiSig is pretty much Bitcoin 2.0 - instant confirmations (like most of the times even faster than in 15 seconds).\n\n\nOf course right now you may think its far away. But I believe one day Bitcoin Community can and **should** vote towards slowing down confirmation time to 20, then 30, then even 60 minutes for network confirmations. **Because speed of network confirmations are not so important with MultiSig!** 60 minutes confirmations would solve blocks / transactions propagation problem (the problem with bandwidth / problems with expanding limits for block-size) without sacrificing decentralized manner of Bitcoin itself.

I would say we are nowhere near market saturation of the following groups:\n- speculative investors who are willing to risk a small portion of their savings on a potential big gainer/new technology \n- diversifying investors who are similarly looking to put a small portion of their portfolio in different asset classes (precious metals, real estate, cryptocurrency)\n- unbanked/underbanked in the 3rd world looking for access to global markets\n\nOn the other hand I\'d guess we are somewhat near the saturation point of 2 markets that have helped Bitcoin grow greatly in its first 5 years:\n- privacy seekers who use cryptocurrency to purchase goods online without giving away their identity \n- libertarians who use and invest in Bitcoin because it means fewer war dollars for the federal reserve to give to the govt to use to make bombs. \n\nAlso there is always the possibility (however small) of a new competitor overtaking Bitcoin, or of flaws in the code or some new invention that displaces cryptocurrency entirely. \n\nTL;dr High risk, potential high reward; I\'m overall very bullish on a 2-4 year timeframe.

Thus, in the information age, a global kind of decentralized currency makes sense. For example, I am from India. You may be from anywhere in the world.

In the 2000s, they instead gave everyone loans mostly to people who never should receive a loan (practically no possible way to pay it back).   \n\nInvestment banks used something called financial derivitives to package up these loans into something called a CDO (derivitive) and allowed investors to "bet" on them.  \n\nWhat gives these cdos value is their "rating" (A,AA,AAA etc).  Rating companies wouldnt get paid unless they gave high ratings to these crap cdos.\n\nSo basically, thats like you saying to credit rating agencies, every time someone asks for my credit rating, I will pay you $1000 if you say it is good, $100,000 if you say it is great and ZERO if you say its anything but those. \n\nSo these CDOs (which are destined to fail because, these poor people put zero money into the house for example, so any trouble = boom bankruptcy walk away see ya thx) were destined to fail.  And the investment banks actually took out insurance (via companies like AIG) policies where WHEN they fail (they undoubtedly would) the investment banks would make tons of money (they literally banked on it).    \n\nSo now, these CDOs start collapsing, AIG cant pay out, the walls crumble, these investment banks (50% of the economy in derivitive facing investment) are facing bankruptcy and a huge nuclear explosion type collapse occurs (2008).\n\nBut..\n\nThe federal reserve printed 3.5 trillion dollars (the US national debt is 14.4 trillion) to prop up these companies that should be dead and buried based on darwinistic market forces.

So an attacker that makes their block timestamp equal to that will cause some nodes to mark it valid and others to mark it invalid.  However, you are saying that once a few extra seconds pass, the block will be recognized as valid by all.\n\nI will probably have to take a look at the actual code since the description is a bit confusing here: https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Block_timestamp\n\nSo for example..\n\nImagine that two nodes A and B have network-adjusted times of 2:58 and 3:00 respectively.  A new incoming block has a time of 4:59.  Node A should reject it (it is 1 minute after the deadline).  Node B should accept it (it is 1 minute before the deadline).  2 minutes then pass and the times change to 3:00 and 3:02.  Both of these nodes now claim this block is valid so the attack only lasted for a few minutes.\n\nA sybil attack involving many fake nodes could also prove bad.

If the miners only disagree a little bit about what the time is, (a minute or less), this attack is nearly meaningless.": 11, 'Thanks, so your initial comment that they shouldn\'t disregard invalid timestamps was wrong.\n\nNow since we know that:\n\n"A timestamp is accepted as valid if it is greater than the median timestamp of previous 11 blocks, and less than the network-adjusted time + 2 hours.

Now my question is how this is going to work out?\n\nEdit: ...and is it the "network-adjusted time" at time of reception of the block, or at the "current" time?\n* If the latter, a miner that is receving such a block might not yet accept it at the time of reception, but 2 seconds later it may accept it.

I don\'t know if this is a feature already implemented in the bitcoin miner reference implementation; if not maybe it *should be implemented to bitcoin pro-actively*! And the threshold for what time deviation relative to the own time is still accepted could be parameterisable in config file (similar to some other parameters, like e.g. block inclusion criteria for transactions), if the miner\'s operator does not like the default value. This way I think "sybil timing attackers" should be sqeezed out of the Bitcoin network effectively.': 1, 'This is something that I had actually been thinking about (and worrying about) for the past year.  I will ignore the economic incentives that may or may not prevent an attack.  Instead, lets look at the technical side.\n\nThe issue comes down to treating all information that decides if a block is valid as a pure function.  Imagine a function called isValid that decides if a block is valid.  All parameters to this function are identical for every user on the decentralized network except for the "network-adjusted time".  Since this parameter relies on the nodes each user sees, this can cause different users to believe a block is valid while others believe it is invalid.\n\nThe timestamp T is valid if:\nT > X && T < Y\n\nX is determined entirely on prior blocks, and therefore is a pure function.  All users will agree upon the result of T > X.\n\nY is determined using the timestamps of neighbouring nodes, and therefore is not a pure function.  All users will not agree upon the result of T < Y.\n\nThis will potentially cause two users to disagree upon the validity of a block.  If we assume that user A and user B disagree upon the validity of the block, a fork would be created.\n\nIt seems that a fatal flaw is that the calculation of block validity depends on something other than the blocks themselves.  This potentially means that difficulty adjustment is not safely possible in a decentralized system.\n\nI hope someone can clear this up for me and explain why I\'m wrong.\n\nNow if we take the economics and incentives into account, does it make sense for a bad actor to do this?  A fork would certainly cause a panic and the price to drop.  It would also yield their 25 BTC unrecognised by one of the forks.  The attacker could short Bitcoin.
