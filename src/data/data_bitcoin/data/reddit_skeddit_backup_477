If someone wants a locker, they can make an instant copy of any key and use the locker it corresponds to. I say copy because all possible keys are always available to everyone. There is no way to find the key to a locker (except by chance, good luck), but it is easy to find the locker for a specific key.': 6, "Good analogy, but:\n\n> Furthermore, there is only one copy of the key, and it is in possession of that locker\xe2\x80\x99s owner; Nobody else is able to get inside without that key.\n\nIn that analogy, when someone takes possession of an unused locker, he gets the unique key that opens it.

You do need a private key to unlock the locker.  But knowing the locker address in no way lets you know how to cut the key to work. In other words, if you know just the address you can not know what the private key is to unlock it. You can try to guess, but that is an unfeasible endeavor.\n\nThe analogy of seeing into the locker (and knowing its address) is a good one, because anyone can peruse the blockchain ledger.  If you know an address, you can check to see what is there. And if you want to cut a random private key, you can derive the public address and check to see if there is any bitcoin assigned to that address.

He tried out repeatedly, and for 9 straight years, he was rejected, but he kept on trying.  They told him that he was too small and too unimposing to ever make it as an NBA ref.  But he simply refused to give up.  In 1975, he finally made it.  He ended up refereeing over 2,600 consecutive NBA games over the span of a nearly 40 year career. He still holds the NBA league record for most consecutive games as referee.\n\nImagination is what allowed him to continue going back year after year of rejection. He never lost the vision of himself as a NBA ref in his mind, no matter how much people told him that he was not up to snuff.  The average person would just give up, and not let themselves continue to think such "foolish thoughts".\n\n**Mediocrity is not that act of being average, it is ACCEPTING that you are average as a fact in your own mind**: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dick_Bavetta': -1, 'This thread has been linked to from another place on reddit.\n\n- [/r/cryptofanfiction] ["Cryptocelebrities on Cyberparade"](//np.reddit.com/r/cryptofanfiction/comments/33vprm/cryptocelebrities_on_cyberparade/)\n\n[](#footer)*^(If you follow any of the above links, respect the rules of reddit and don\'t vote.) ^\\([Info](/r/TotesMessenger/wiki/) ^/ ^[Contact](/message/compose/?to=\\/r\\/TotesMessenger))*\n\n[](#bot)': 2, "They don't need it.

With few miners or few full nodes, there is concern for centralized control and seizure of funds in bitcoin (central control of miners could reject transactions from addresses and central control of full nodes could reject mined blocks with those addresses and/or not relay transactions to miners with those addresses).\n\nFull nodes are the gateways to the entire network.
