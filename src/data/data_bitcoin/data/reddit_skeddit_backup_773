The possibility of getting rich in the coarse of 5 years is pretty attractive. You can't go up fast without having some fast dips too.\n\n3. Programmable money is instantly interchangeable using services like coinbase or bitpay for whatever form of money you prefer so bushiness can accept bitcoin with 0 risk. That isn't close to 0 or near 0, it is literally 0 risk to the price of bitcoins. \n\n4. Gold is almost exclusively hoarded as well. We dig it up, melt it into pretty shapes and then bury it in metal boxes. Just because gold is hoarded doesn't mean it is in one giant bubble. \n\n5. Coinbase and Bitpay do not move the risk to their books at all, they exchange the money at the point of sale for the merchant. They have 0 risk from going bankrupt with this service because it is adding to their bottom line through fees and they do not keep the bitcoins themselves as a speculation. \n\n6. The majority of start-ups in the internet in the 90s went bankrupt too. A few didn't, maybe you heard of a particularly big one called google. Don't keep your bitcoins on an exchange, problem solved. \n\n7. Prove I own my bitcoins and then we can talk about your imaginary future taxes that may or may not be imposed sometime in the next 100 years. While we are at it lets discuss the problems in the current moon rover for everyday commute on the future moon colony. \n\n8. Transactions are instant and irreversible, this actually ends up being a plus over credit cards that could get charge-backed up to six months later. Services will eventually arise for consumers that want insured transactions for an additional cost but this will not be imparted onto all users in the form of high transaction fees like the credit card companies. Charge-backs are extremely hard on small businesses. \n\n9. Again insured transactions will be provided when there is enough demand for this service. However at this time bitcoiners generally know to handle them like digital cash and would rather keep 100% of their bitcoins instead of paying fees for mandatory insurance. Multi-signature wallets address the rest of your 'omg it could be stolen' arguments. So could your computer Mr.Bitcorn, tell me should we all have mandatory insurances on all our computers too? By the way coins out of circulation add value to the rest of them still circulating. \n\n10. Economic stability? *seriously?* was 2008 really that long ago? Or are all those problems magically gone now because the talking heads on your tv are not mentioning them anymore? Bitcoin exists as an alternative because states have abused the responsibility of managing currency. The digital revolution started with eliminating state control over media and will continue with bitcoin and eliminating state control over currency.

I had considered myself a careful user by doing all of the "right" things:\n\n1. Set up 2fa on auth\n2. Set up 2fa on all transactions over a small amount\n3. Verify URLs and SSL certs\n\nAnd because of these things, I had a false sense of security and let my guard down. As a software developer who has written auth code, I honestly thought the OAuth screen that said "Authorize Coinbase access to your account?" button was very interesting and assumed that Coinbase had done something innovative to segment access internally within applications/internal services. I thought this was maybe an interesting security isolation feature and somehow the multi-sig news I had recently heard about was an implementation. On top of that, I seemed impossible to me that there would be an API key granted for an app called "Coinbase". \n\nCoinbase needs to disable OAuth be default for all users. Users need to explicitly enable it, and there needs to be granular controls on the API calls with the same protections that are given to the web interface. \n\nTo be honest, I\'m not going to feel justified until I get my funds back, as I don\'t feel like I\'ve been irresponsible with my coinbase access credentials.': 47, '[deleted]': 1, "I'm with you.

Should there be a tradeoff between friction and freedom when it comes to API capabilities?  I trust coinbase enough to use it to buy the occasional btc, but it's troubling that a malicious (or improperly secured) oauth token can empty out my account like this.\n\nIt's like the old one about outrunning a bear in the woods -- you don't have to be the fastest runner, just faster than the slowest person in the group.  Coinbase's database is probably more secure than average, but if any developer can get full coinbase API access with any off-the-shelf oauth library, well, thats a bit troubling.\n\nThis will probably be an unpopular opinion, but is there a place for artificial limits on oauth access?  For example, in my fiat bank account, they limit me to $1k for 30 days the first time I do a transfer to a person.  Something like that for oauth-initiated requests does not strike me as unreasonable.  Or something like delay oauth requests by 30 minutes for first-time API's.  Or limit first-time oauth initiated requests to 5% of your balance.\n\nIs there any monitoring in place for what kinds of API requests are done?  This app should have been automatically suspended (or at least flagged for review) once you saw the first three people that connected it had their accounts emptied.\n\nAre there different tiers of oauth access?

At the very least there should be some manual review by coinbase for getting such privileges.\n\nWe're trying to invent something new with crypto, unburdened by many of the limitations of what came before.

More and more things are being prohibited, and the rise of decentralized marketplaces like Open Bazaar and Bitcoin will allow people to more easily sell things like light bulbs that will soon be [prohibited and phased out](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase-out_of_incandescent_light_bulbs).\n\nWith FIAT money your bank account can be shut down by banks, or by government pressure.  The [IRS is seizing](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/26/us/law-lets-irs-seize-accounts-on-suspicion-no-crime-required.html?_r=0) people\'s money when they haven\'t even been accused of a crime.  Our bank accounts are not safe.  If you carry cash while driving down the highway [your are not safe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kEpZWGgJks) from the police stealing your money even when you have not been accused of a crime.  Bitcoin allows you to keep your money encrypted and safe from government thieves.\n\nThe banker bailouts in 2008, and the bail-ins in places like Cyprus show how vulnerable the FIAT money system is.  It shows how corrupt and captured regulators are. The Fed has [tripled the money supply](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-IIyP10PUw) since 2008.  Bitcoin is a fair and honest system, and its only a matter of time before sound money is adopted.  Good money will chase out the bad.\n\nThe real story of Bitcoin\'s future as others have noted is "the other 6 billion\'.  Most people in the world are unbanked and have no access to banking services.  This is a severe economic barrier.  But now we have the spread of cheap smartphones all over the world, and even in places with no running water you can find people with smartphones.  Bitcoin gives you the ability to put a bank on your phone, and we never had that before.  This is going to change things in ways we can\'t yet imagine.\n\nOne of the things that excites me about Bitcoin is that it neuters the state.  The state and the central banks get a lot of their power and ability to wage giant wars from their abilitty to print money out of thin air.  Now that we have Bitcoin and sound money options, it will require the state power and monopolies to shrink and be less powerful.  This smaller government will be a boon to economic freedom, production, and prosperity.\n\n\n\n\n': 6, 'HEAR! HEAR! $1 /u/changetip private': 2, "Wow, well put.

They could start strictly enforcing the money transmitting license requirement.\n\nWhere have you been for the last four years?\n\nAmerica, despite having the majority of VC money, developer community and the largest consumer base, is still nowhere near having a *single* exchange, despite the obvious potential to be a world leader.\n\nCircle and Coinbase are the best current "broker style" stand-ins.\n\n> On points #1 and #4, it\'s not so much that it\'s been underestimated, it\'s that the potential hasn\'t been realized. If it gets big, they will treat it accordingly.\n\nYes, they will, but by then it will be too late.  That\'s the point.': 3, "My theory is that their main weapon has always been regulation to game the system to their favor. Bitcoin doesn't use regulations to function and quite possibly caught them off guard. ": 2, 'Thanks!': 2, "You missed #5. Bitcoin is so tiny and after 6 years still doesn't show signs of massive user adoption that they simply don't care. It's not worth their time and energy. \nNot saying this won't change in the future but for now this is the most likely reason. ": -6, "We just don't want to admit that a network of banks could be using a blockchain internally with no bitcoin unit whatsoever merely for accounting of some kind of assets, and that none of the members in that network are trying to undermine that portion of the network and need no Proof of Work checks and balances to make that happen": 2}, ("Let's talk about the Reddit Secret Santa: a compromise that works for everyone.", 1): {"You're obviously an idiot so I'm not surprised you don't see the problem with your moronic pump idea.\n\nIt's only free money if the giftee converts to fiat or uses it to buy from a vendor who converts to fiat.  Otherwise it's totally worthless.\n\nBut, again, you're obviously dumber than a box of doorknobs, so I'll let you get back to huffing gasoline, or staring at the sun, or whatever it is you do when you're not trying to pump the price of the ponzi scheme you got suckered into.\n\n": 2, 'Thanks for the correct summary of my thread :-) ': 2, 'A "lot" of talk? All I saw was a thread with no upvotes and barely any replies.  There was more self righteous melodrama from bitcoin haters than actual interested users from here, and they were suggesting sending bitcoin along with the gift. Did I miss some other thread or are you just trying to create drama where none actually exists? ': 4, "Not sure if you're serious, but giving cash is always kind of shitty. It definitely isn't in the spirit of a gift exchange game. The guy who posted this may be a trolling ass, but it doesn't matter. If you want gift bitcoin, use the tip bot, stay away from the secret Santa stuff.": 2, 'My post was not an attack on you, your thread, or Bitcoin.

I think this is still in the spirit of the exchange. Have fun and hopefully you get something cool from the person who gets you!": 1, "I think it's fine if you send it in addition to a gift, though of course that's just my opinion. To be honest it wasn't your thread that made me concerned: there was an earlier one where people were proposing just using changetip to send a tip as their entire gift, and *that* I think would definitely be against the spirit of the gift exchange. ": 2, "The problem with spending bitcoins is the sellers convert immediately to fiat. This is bad for the price. It is better if people hold their Bitcoin and don't spend. By gifting bitcoins we get wider acceptance and if the receiver holds the price goes up. Now they might like it at first but they will change their mind in a few years time when their $5 worth of Bitcoin is worth literally millions. We need to gift as many people in secret Santa bitcoins as we can, because they will thank us later": -3, "Maybe I didn't see that one. Obviously Secret Santa is about thinking what would suit your match best, and I would always say that this goes first.": 2, 'Yes, no problem. And also your idea is absolutely useful. I guess the opinions just differ on whether it is still in the sense of the Secret Santa to find the best stuff for your match, and additionally give away some bitcoin, or whether that is not a good thing to do.': 2, "I signed up for the secret Santa, and I planned on sending my partner some bitcoin *along with* another gift.  The main gift was going to be whatever they mentioned, and a side gift of bitcoin. I don't see anything wrong with that. Just sending btc is a bad idea, unless you're partnered to someone who requests it. ": 1, "There were other threads with much more discussion. This post isn't meant as an attack on anyone, and if it comes across like that then I wrote it poorly and I apologize.
