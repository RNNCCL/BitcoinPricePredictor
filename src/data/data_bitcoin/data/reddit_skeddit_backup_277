I did really mean "everyone".': 2, 'Relevant [quote from Gavin](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2015-September/011255.html):\n>If you start with the premise that more than half of Bitcoin miners would\ndo something crazy that would either destroy Bitcoin or would be completely\nunacceptable to you, personally... then maybe you should look for some\nother system that you might trust more, because Bitcoin\'s basic security\nassumption is that a supermajority of miners are \'honest.\'  \n\nSeriously, I hear nothing but pessimism from core devs about "the mining situation."  Is bitcoin fatally flawed? Should we take Gavin\'s advice?': 0, "The pessimism is not directed towards the supermajority of miners suddenly becoming dishonest, it's directed towards the possibility that without maintaining the right rules/limits, natural economic forces will tend the supermajority of miners towards being a smaller and smaller group.  (As /u/nullc pointed out, the most economically efficient arrangement would be a single miner.)": 1, 'Allow me an honest question that begins with a bit of a thought experiment.\n\nThe Bitcoin protocol rules constrain miners from producing more than a programmed amount of new bitcoins each block, starting at 50 and halving every 210,000 blocks. The implementation of this limit is functionally the same as the block size limit.\n\nYou argue,\n\n> If we need to protect The Blockchain from miners now that the system has reached its current level of scale, We Have Already Lost.\n\nDo you also believe that the system should not inhibit miners from selfishly creating inflation and rewarding themselves more than the programmed amount of Bitcoins?\n\nSimilarly, the system enforces that transactions in blocks must have valid digital signatures.  Blocks which have transactions without valid digital signatures are non-blocks as far as bitcoin nodes are concerned.   This restriction on miner behavior means that miners couldn\'t do "useful" things like return uncontroversially lost coins to their owners.   Do you believe they should not be subject to that restriction either?\n\nI could continue, as there are dozen of rules implemented in the Bitcoin protocol... and every one of them exists to constrain miners. \n\nWhy?  The bitcoin system makes a strong assumption that a majority of the hash-power will be "honest"-- but why will they be honest?  On top of that assumption we can reason about the short and long term economics incentives of the miners, and that they\'re better off behaving "honestly" than not. But why are they better off cooperating? In part, because the rules are structured in such a way as to limit the benefits they can enjoy when breaking the rules and establishing costs for trying; ... and impressively bitcoin manage to do this without necessitating persistent identities which could act as choke points for centralized control.\n\nI think a logically-rational person could try to take a much stronger assumption about miner honesty-- and say that the system doesn\'t need incentives but instead should trust the miners completely (or else "we have already lost"). But if so, I do not see why that person doesn\'t go all the way and suggest dropping all limits on their behavior.\n\nOne reason is that the facts of the situation don\'t support comfort in that configuration. Right now a majority hash power is controlled by a half dozen people (or perhaps less) ... if, when Bitcoin was announced-- if it were just a ledger multisigned where a half dozen anonymous parties could unilaterally control it and do whatever they want... would you have used it?   I wouldn\'t have bothered.  What if the half dozen people were self-selecting by putting up a bunch of money for computer hardware? That wouldn\'t have improved my view of it.\n\nSo I think we do count on the complete behavior of the system for security, and not just trusting miners-- because from the perspective of trusting miners the system reduces to trust a half dozen anonymous self selecting parties, which isn\'t very comforting or compelling. Trusting them only in a narrow sense that requires them to only be economically rational and doesn\'t fail completely if they\'re not quite is much better, and in line with Bitcoin\'s earliest descriptions as a system which used cryptographic proof, instead of trust.\n\n>  The consensus block size should come to rest where the marginal utility of a transaction on The Blockchain is equal to the marginal cost (fee/kb or what have you) of space there.\n\nThe cost to _whom_?  When you include a transaction as a miner you pay only your local costs, your local disk space your local bandwidth and CPU.  But then every other node on the system (miner and non-miner alike) are forced to eat those same costs, N times over as an externalize, but they do not enjoy the fee you collected only you do.  So unless I am misunderstanding what you\'re trying to say there-- the specific equilibrium you imagine existing there only exist if the network centralizes to a single node.\n': 8, "So then the potential damage a single core dev could do is unlimited (using your logic from a previous post). I don't understand how a council of self-appointed developers all of a sudden have full veto power on any change to bitcoin.

If this could actually be used to reward both seeders for bandwidth and content creators, this just might be bitcoin\'s killer app. \n\nI could really see this going two ways. \n\n1) You\'d end up with true piracy with people profiting off stolen content, which only increase the drive for bittorrent to be shutdown. I don\'t think that\'s an impossibility with enough money on the table. \n\n2) It could blow open the doors for content creators to profit on bittorrent. Holy shit, this could kill/decentralize youtube and other content hosts/aggregators. What the hell is the point of youtube if content creators and seeders can profit on a distributed network with no ads?\n\nObviously there are a couple of problems with 2. Most importantly, how could you verify the seed is from the real creator? Youtube has the same problem, but at least the centralized system allows contesting theft. That\'s a much harder problem to solve and really depends on a solid, decentralized identity management system, which we still haven\'t fully figured out. It might be partially solved by companies that provide "good" clients that try to fight piracy. If the majority use these, you might be able to ignore the small amount of piracy. \n\nSo long as micro payments scale and we work out a solid way to reward creators and fight piracy, this could end up being incredible.': 13, '[deleted]': 1, 'Do you have the latest Miley Cyrus disk?

If they endorse R3\'s approach, it suggests R3 is no longer a \'competitor\' to the banks but rather an \'enabler\'. If you\'re saying R3 is a competitor to Bitcoin, then I do agree in some aspects it is (Bitcoin as a payment network, in particular, though even there Bitcoin may retain the advantage by being completely permissionless).\n\nIf we take a look at one example of a bank, Deutsche, we see their thinking is to completely exclude Bitcoin from their plans and instead use a separate closed ledger to increase efficiency (https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3mqcra/deutsche_bank_research_blockchain_technology_is/cvhcu1d).\n\nIf we extend this, we can imagine R3 CEV will, in consultation with banks, be looking to extend that model. Tim\'s latest blog post supports this view (https://twitter.com/jgarzik/status/648893594590412800) that Bitcoin is irrelevant, implying R3 CEV wants nothing to do with it. Assuming R3\'s tech is robust for whatever they wish to use it for, I don\'t think R3 actually needs Bitcoin. It depends on what they want to achieve. R3\'s Rutter has said they want to build a ledger that is "secure, scalable, and meets AML and KYC". Bitcoin is incompatible with the AML/KYC aspect.\n\nThat being said...

In my view, the industry consists of the individuals pursuing competition with incumbent financial institutions"\n\nSo, when you say this, I think it brings up a schism. r/bitcoin is a sub where people are interested in Bitcoin/bitcoin first and foremost, as it\'s the first cryptocurrency and has the largest and most developed network by many orders of magnitude. Really, Bitcoin represents its own financial network (or \'alternate universe\' if you like) where the cryptocurrency token can exist and interact entirely outside of the existing system. Many things are possible in that world, just one of which is using bitcoin to store wealth in a portable and free-to-use fashion without restrictions. Thus, r/bitcoin is not really here to support startups that don\'t make use of bitcoins or bitcoin\'s ledger, or startups that are looking to piggyback on the \'bitcoin fad\' to raise funding or be bootstrapped by users in the bitcoin world. If a startup is not involved directly with bitcoin or bitcoin\'s blockchain, then I don\'t think r/bitcoin is the appropriate place for such a startup.

I don\'t know).\n\nInstead, they want to exclusively stick to private systems that achieve 80% of the benefit (assuming they actually do produce benefit).\n\nThe result will be existing legacy systems may improve quite a bit, reducing incentive for consumers to move to Bitcoin and causing Bitcoin adoption rate to plunge.\n\nHence, it does not seem like this "validation of our industry" will have a net positive effect on Bitcoin.\n\nDisagree?': 4, 'Great questions /u/eragmus. I\'ll try to share my ideas, but I\'m mostly guessing and mostly biased!\n\n1. I agree with your feeling so I should clarify that when I use the term "industry" I am not inferring an appreciating price of bitcoin as part of that definition. In my view, the industry consists of the individuals pursuing competition with incumbent financial institutions. R3 is now a well-funded competitor who just validated a market opportunity that the incumbents had previously ignored.\n\n2. Banks will continue to be banks and regulators will continue to regulate. Legacy systems will improve, but I think trying to move a herd of 22 banks to adopt a standard won\'t be swift. Remember Chip Cards in USA? Banks compete with each other so any bank that can compete outside the herd and win, will be looking for an edge. Also, as startups, we should now be pointing our investors to look at R3 as validation that a substantial market disruption opportunity exists.\n\n3. Lastly, R3\'s innovation still comes mostly from Bitcoin. Tim wouldn\'t be writing his latest blog post without the bitcoin ecosystem\'s thriving innovation and evolution. Take away Bitcoin and R3 and the banks will be on their own. Again, innovation happens at the edges, not at the center of the herd so I\'m not worried that the price of bitcoin will benefit in some way.

Sure, we won't be able to 'spend tomorrow's money today', but that also means that I will take humanity longer to reach some sort of singularity.\n\nBasic econ. The amount of monetary supply should equal economic activity. The expansion of the monetary base beyond the economic activity causes inflation, which if it is unreasonably high it simply means the theft of value from the people as their wealth is absorbed by those who create more wealth and then trade that wealth for other tangible and non tangible assets that accumulate value instead of decrease in value. This power has been abused by every single power that has ever held it, history has endless examples of this type of tyranny against the people.\n\nBitcoin is a limited supply, but why do you think that it is not feasible for expanded global economic activity? You do realize there is currently 2,100,000,000,000,000 satoshi's, right? And that if bitcoin because so very large that 2.1 thousand trillion units of account would not be able to handle the economic activity, it would be capable of changing how many decimals it does go to, creating more units of account? You could add one single decimal place to add 8 thousand trillion units of accounting.\n\nAlso, FYI, banks dont see fractional reserves as a problem. They see it as a natural part of monetary policy.

So long as they all passively agree not to improve things, customers continually getting screwed but have *no other choice*.\n\nWhat has occurred (currently and in the past) is a price-fixing scheme, whether it be willful or not.

The community has done an amazing job creating potential killer apps such as streamium, social tipping, remittance, easy paywalls and other micro payment solutions unavailable/unviable in fiat land. What worries me is that R3 will all of sudden be able to compete in this area, and it will certainly appeal to average banked Joe when they release their first Mobile Dollar Wallet, vouched for by both well-known banks and governments.\n\n\nIf this is where we're heading, I think bitcoin's only chance to flourish is via the third world.

Remember that banks are banks, and they are just grasping at straws to remain in control of the monetary policy.\n\nThis does not solve fractional reserves, it just enables them to do it with greater efficiency.

So that might outweigh some of the tragedy of the commons in that the your transaction data continues to be potentially useful to others in the future, because it becomes the basis of transactions they want to push to the network.\n\nIt is tricky though, you're right.
