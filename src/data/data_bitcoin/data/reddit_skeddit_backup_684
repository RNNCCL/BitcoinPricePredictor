Luckily, I happened to be passing by with Andreas Antonopoulos, and we stepped in to give our standard routine explaining the wonders of a lawless world, the horrors of civilised society, and how holding just $5 worth of decentralized digital currency could bring balance to the force. \n\nEveryone agreed that a community effort to support the most vulnerable members of society went against their strongest beliefs, that rapacious self-interest was the only virtue of humanity, and that  those who owned no Bitcoin should have to sit at the back of the bus. We then started a small orgy: all printing off our paper wallets and circle-jerking all over them to they were reduced to a pulpy mess.\n\nAs we lay in this exhausted mess a respected economist walked in and suggested that owning $5 worth of pulped up paper Bitcoin and annoying people with our crappy shilling was not adding value to the economy in any way, shape, or form. He suggested we stopped circle-jerking and attempted to build some kind of business to add value to the community. We all spat in his face, and told him his obvious trolling could not break us.\n\nNext, a noted mathematician happened upon us in our stupor. Curious, he inquired on nature of Bitcoin. Happily, we restarted our well-rehearsed shrilling routine. However, when he asked why Bitcoin appeared to be based on a bizarrely chosen elliptic curve and suggested a more generic one should be chosen we realised him for the government shrill he was. Again we spat in his face and held open to door for him to leave.\n\nFinally, a masked and unidentifiable person of no particular merit entered. They told us that Bitcoin would change the world, and they suggested we invested all our no-charge-back currency with them for a 7% a week return. Recognising a true captain of industry we did so. \n\nNow, we wait.

(there is no single, standard definition, btw.) Way overpriced in the short term based more on a frenzy of speculative buying than actual value/utility, might be a better description of the thing we\'re discussing here. But within the context of discussions about bitcoin in the media it\'s often criticized for being a \'bubble\' by (financial) journalists, the OP in this thread addressed such people on *their* use of words, so let\'s not argue semantics too much and just argue the point.\n\nAnyway, contrary to your experiences I don\'t know of anyone who uses the word bubble purely and exclusively in hindsight. It\'s more like the wikipedia article:\n\n> An economic bubble (sometimes referred to as a speculative bubble, a market bubble, a price bubble, a financial bubble, a speculative mania or a balloon) is "trade in high volumes at prices that are considerably at variance with intrinsic values". It could also be described as a situation in which asset prices appear to be based on implausible or inconsistent views about the future.\n\nUnder this more common (in my experience) definition, I\'d definitely call it a bubble on the first point (it trades at a higher price and volume than we would expect from merely the utility that bitcoin has for a few million people.) On the second point, I\'d say it\'s not a bubble in the sense that I do believe the views about the future that would support such a high price level are plausible. i.e. I believe bitcoin has a genuine chance to become an important element of our financial system used by at least hundreds of millions of people (knowingly as a currency or unknowingly as a protocol)\n\nYou\'re more referring to this:\n> Because it is often difficult to observe intrinsic values in real-life markets, bubbles are often conclusively identified only in retrospect, when a sudden drop in prices appears. Such a drop is known as a crash or a bubble burst. \n\n': 0, 'Winkelvii say exchange rate can go to $40000.  ': 2, 'That is nothing compared with the insanity of snapchat being valued at $10 Billion.

I think there are a lot of factors.\n\nOne factor is the environmental costs of all that electricity being burned for nothing. After thinking about it more, I've realized that bitcoin is providing a service by allowing things like Silk Road to exist. But it's not clear that this is a service which should be provided, let alone worth the costs of running it.\n\nAnother factor early on was economic. A deflationary currency would be a disaster, so I didn't want bitcoin to become the main currency. Luckily, after learning more about bitcoin, I realized that it won't take off and it can't take off in its current form, so this is no longer a real concern to me.  \n\nBut another major factor is that so many bitcoin proponents are based on rather *odd* beliefs. It's just funny to watch them, and since the bubble burst, there's been a fair amount of schadenfreude too.\n\nAnyway, that's just my own views. I'm sure everyone has their own reason for thinking whatever they think. I think it would be interesting to turn the question around. Why are you pro-bitcoin?

I suppose if you are convinced that a deflationary currency is a bad idea then there there really isn't much more that can be discussed, so if that's your reason for rejecting bitcoin as a viable solution to the problem of organizing human activity, fair enough. I think that most advocates of bitcoin do not see the (eventual) constant supply of bitcoin as a problem, probably because there are examples of productive economies with deflationary currencies throughout human history.\n\nI'm assuming by *odd* beliefs you mean libertarian/an-cap/anti-state beliefs? I agree that many of these beliefs (I would call them ideologies) sound strange at first glance, but you must also acknowledge that there are a lot of very thoughtful people who hold these beliefs and there is a whole body of scholarly literature on them. Like any ideology, you can either agree or disagree (or be ambivalent), but dismissing these ideologies as *odd* without engaging them intellectually, is, I think, a mistake. I'm not saying you have to agree (or even disagree), but I think one of the problems that a lot of pro-bitcoin people have with people who object on ideological grounds is that they tend to not really be well-versed in the ideology they are attacking. Imagine if you met someone who was vehemently anti-democracy who couldn't even coherently articulate the basic philosophy underpinning democracy of the structures of a typical democratic government. I'm pretty sure it would be a very frustrating experience! I think many of the more ideologically-driven members of the bitcoin community feel the same way.\n\nAs far as your last question is concerned: personally I am pro-bitcoin because I believe that, on a fundamental level, people have the right to voluntarily exchange goods and services without the interference of a centralized authority and bitcoin facilitates this. Not only do I believe that the free exchange of goods and services is a human right, I think that it will allow people to be more productive and create more wealth for everyone. I know it's popular to demonize free market advocates as greedy or uncaring, but personally I am in favor of free markets because I think it will enable everyone to be better off (including the poorest among us).\n\nAnyway, thanks again for your thoughtful reply. 10,000 bits /u/changetip      ": 0, "You're lying.

': -2, 'This means we have won.': 2, 'I agree, but the situation is somewhat nuanced. If you\'re interested, here\'s a post that I made a while ago on this subject:\n\nI have a pet theory about bitcoin trolls, which I\'m sure they won\'t like:\n\n*Dons armchair anthropologist cap*\n\nI think that a sizable number of trolls may have once held bitcoin or seriously considered holding bitcoin at some point. In short, the typical troll (or at least one archetype thereof) was at some point psychologically invested in bitcoin in a way that is probably similar to the typical bitcoin-positive person.\n\nHowever, unlike most bitcoin-positive people, these trolls at some point become disillusioned with bitcoin due to some event or frustration. One example of such an event might be selling all one\'s bitcoin in frustration as a result of a price decline, hence explaining why we tend to see more bitcoin trolls during long drawn out bear markets. Another example might be a catastrophic loss of one\'s bitcoin savings due to a failure to hold private keys or store them properly (this includes people who got Goxed, etc.). In any case, the resulting "disillusionment" with bitcoin causes the proto-bitcoin troll to change his or her entire attitude toward bitcoin as a psychological defense mechanism that reconciles the trauma of whatever event caused a loss in the drive to support bitcoin. Just as the harshest, bitterest critics of a company, organization or ideology tend to be people who were once positively invested in said company, organization or ideology, so too are the bitterest critics of bitcoin often formerly positively invested in the idea of bitcoin.\n\nIn addition to the above, I also think there is a substantial population of trolls who have never been psychologically invested in bitcoin in a positive way, but who dislike bitcoin on ideological grounds. These trolls typically do not understand bitcoin at a fundamental level, but they see certain ideological language in /r/bitcoin which conflicts with their own views. The best example I can think of is the anti-libertarian, pro-state or pro-status quo crowd who like to use name-calling ("Ron Paul fun bux," etc.) in the same way that rabid fans of Rush Limbaugh like to resort to immature name calling to belittle people who espouse different views.\n\nFinally, there are some people who just enjoy trolling for the sake of trolling. For them, it is a form of recreation. This last class of trolls is not unique to the bitcoin community, of course, but the above two archetypes definitely are and I think they go a long way in accounting for the unusually high number of trolls we see here.': 8, '\xf0\x9f\x98\x81 lol ': 0, "Haha, someone read the dude's post history.": 4, 'Holy fuck, you are one pathetic sack of shit.

A good place to learn about the an-cap position on the market failure problem as it relates to externalities is [this Wikipedia entry and the sources cited within](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-market_environmentalism).\n\nThe notion that markets fail when there are some irrational actors is pretty controversial, particularly since the market tends to dis-favor these actors.\n\nAs far as information asymmetry is concerned. I agree that in the past information was valuable and hard to come by, but with the marginal cost of information now approaching zero, the "information asymmetry" argument is more and more difficult to support. The reputation systems in place on the darknet markets demonstrate that, provided there is little marginal cost to do so, people will demand certain information (reputation information) and they will use it to their advantage to ensure that they are not scammed or cheated. This system is highly efficient and does not require a centralized authority to tell people who they can and cannot transact with.\n\nWhile I agree that perhaps the world at large is not totally prepared for a libertarian revolution, I think that there will be a gradual transition away from the state as it becomes less useful in general. This is already happening with the increasing availability of information allowing people to make smarter individual decisions, eliminating the need for regulators to tell people what they can and cannot consume. Hell, the entire drug war is basically a case study of how people completely disregard regulations when regulations fail to reflect reality and it is a great example of how regulatory institutions can fail spectacularly at great cost to human health and happiness. The current financial system is, arguably, an even greater example of this same kind of regulatory failure. All in all, I think that as the marginal cost of information and education continues to go to zero, there will be less demand for the state to "protect people from themselves" and more demand for the freedom to make personal decisions, whether they are good or bad. \n\nUltimately I think the libertarian position pretty much boils down to "a system with a centralized monopolistic authority will usually produce inferior outcomes versus a market of individuals engaged in voluntary interactions because the world is fantastically complicated and the market (which is just another way of saying millions or billions of individuals) is much better at processing the "data" of reality and adapting itself to said data to produce greater wealth." This is not just a philosophical position, but a conceptual one that is supported by insights from systems theory. Whatever their character, decentralized autonomous systems tend to be less fragile, more robust and (ultimately, but not necessarily at all time points) more efficient than top-down command hierarchies.\n\nAnyway, sorry about the wall of text.

And how potentially peculiar too. On one level, the appearance of an alternative \xe2\x80\x94 quasi-subversive \xe2\x80\x94 currency is not wildly new. After all, investors have been putting money into gold for many decades, partly because they do not trust governments (or banks). And this mistrust has been rising rapidly in recent years, as western monetary experiments keep gathering pace \xe2\x80\x94 hence all those gold bars now sitting in Swiss banks.\nBut what is striking about the Bitcoin experiment is that it takes the issue of trust to a new level. Instead of relying on governments and banks to underpin currencies, investors are essentially placing their faith in a complicated piece of cryptography and software, maintained by a community of volunteers and users with possibly conflicted interests and diverse levels of skill and commitment \xe2\x80\x93 and people have as little knowledge about how it really works as they have about Wall Street financial products or central bank balance sheets. To my mind, at least, that almost makes it seem rational to have faith in gold bars.\nConsider for a moment how the Bitcoin project works. The currency first emerged some five years ago, when a mysterious computer expert called Satoshi Nakamoto created an online payment system using open-sourced software. This, essentially, is a peer-to-peer exchange system \xe2\x80\x94 using a unit of value known as Bitcoin \xe2\x80\x94 that does not require a central administrator or repository, since payments are recorded in a central public electronics ledger, which is maintained by the community.\nIn theory, this community element is supposed to give users more independence. It is also meant to confer greater credibility to currency than fiat money. After all, the beauty of using Bitcoin is that you do not need to rely on costly and slow-moving bank payment systems: \xe2\x80\x9cmoney\xe2\x80\x9d can be sent to or exchanged anywhere in the world. And the value of that money will not be wiped out if a government suddenly decides to turn on the printing press. Instead, the number of Bitcoins in circulation can only increase at a fixed rate each year, and in 2140 the total supply of Bitcoins will be capped at 21 million \xe2\x80\x94 or so the protocols say. This ensures that the \xe2\x80\x9cvalue\xe2\x80\x9d is democratically determined by supply and demand.\nBut, in reality, it is clear that the value of Bitcoin can fluctuate wildly, just like any other asset. Over the past two years, for example, Bitcoin\xe2\x80\x99s value soared from $50 per Bitcoin (in 2012) to $1,150 (in late 2013), before collapsing this year to under $400, when a scandal erupted about the use of Bitcoin for money laundering. That makes Bitcoin arguably the worst-performing asset this year. Worse still, it is also clear that Bitcoin only works as a \xe2\x80\x9ccurrency\xe2\x80\x9d if people have rock-solid faith in their computers. After all, the risk of having electronic ledgers as the store of value is that the money could disappear if hackers broke into the system. Indeed, it can disappear if you just lose your electronic \xe2\x80\x9ckey\xe2\x80\x9d, ie passcode. (And there are cases of that happening when people have accidentally wiped their hard drive, say, or lost their records.)\n\xe2\x80\x89.\xe2\x80\x89.\xe2\x80\x89.\xe2\x80\x89\nOf course, a cynic might argue that this same point about cyber risk also applies to modern global finance and many other aspects of the business world. And they do not appear to be stopping Bitcoin\xe2\x80\x99s expansion, even into emerging markets. Never mind Bali bars; last week Microsoft announced it would accept Bitcoin for some accounts. Groups such as Dell, Expedia, Zynga, Virgin Galactic, PayPal and Atomic Mail have started accepting it too. Greenpeace and Wikimedia accept it for donations, and some US political candidates have declared they would accept Bitcoin campaign finance.\nThe more the Bitcoin revolution spreads, the more it reveals both the perils and power of innovation. The cyber technology that now ties our world together has made us dependent on potentially fragile cyber links. But it has also shrunk the globe, delivered extraordinary convenience and is making us all think afresh. Even my banker friend Mats. These days, he says he is (healthily) wary of Bitcoin. But he has nevertheless acquired a wallet of the cryptocurrency to bring with him back to Europe, as a travel souvenir-cum-modern equivalent of a gold bar.

I guess Nxt should not ignore it in long-term as the profitable activity will be implemented by somebody sooner or later\n\n- there\'s no long-range attack against a blockchain V. Buterin described, only short-range. The short-range attack doesn\'t allow double-spending but gives multibranching forger possibility to earn more fees in singlebranch environment by producing few blocks in a row. However producing few blocks in a row could be an issue too (e.g. evil forger may postpones orders submissions etc) but not critical at the moment.\n\n- not explicitly stated in the paper but easily derived, a long delay between blocks not only annoying but also a security problem as it\'s the moment for short-range attack could happens\n\n- we have formally defined nothing-at-stake attack(again, using Buterin\'s informal definition) and made initial simulations. We haven\'t included their results in paper as they are seems to be too raw, but I can reveal them here: N@S attack could happens only in short-range, e.g. for within 20 blocks for 10% stake, so with 30 confirmations we haven\'t observed the successful attack. Also please note the attack has pretty unpredictable nature for attacker, so he can hardly enforce it, even in theory(in practice it\'s even harder to get it done properly).

NXT's model (txfees only to remove the double-singing incentive since alt forks have no transactions on them) works to reduce the NaS incentive to zero, but the problem is that if your system relies on incentives being exactly zero then your system is vulnerable to epsilon-sized bribes.

': 2, 'A Severe Strain on Credulity\n\nAs a method of sending a missile to the higher, and even highest, part of the earth\'s atmospheric envelope, Professor Goddard\'s multiple-charge rocket is a practicable, and therefore promising device. Such a rocket, too, might carry self-recording instruments, to be released at the limit of its flight, and conceivable parachutes would bring them safely to the ground. It is not obvious, however, that the instruments would return to the point of departure; indeed, it is obvious that they would not, for parachutes drift exactly as balloons do. And the rocket, or what was left of it after the last explosion, would have to be aimed with amazing skill, and in dead calm, to fall on the spot where it started.\n\nBut that is a slight inconvenience, at least from the scientific standpoint, though it might be serious enough from that of the always innocent bystander a few hundred or thousand yards away from the firing line. It is when one considers the multiple- charge rocket as a traveler to the moon that one begins to doubt and looks again, to see if the dispatch announcing the professor\'s purposes and hopes says that he is working under the auspices of the Smithsonian Institution. It does say so, and therefore the impulse to do more than doubt the practicability of such a device for such a purpose must be -- well, controlled. Still, to be filled with uneasy wonder and express it will be safe enough, for after the rocket quits our air and and really starts on its longer journey, its flight would be neither accelerated nor maintained by the explosion of the charges it then might have left. To claim that it would be is to deny a fundamental law of dynamics, and only Dr. Einstein and his chosen dozen, so few and fit, are licensed to do that.\n\nHis Plan Is Not Original\n\nThat Professor Goddard, with his "chair" in Clark College and the countenancing of the Smithsonian Institution, does not know the relation of action to reaction, and of the need to have something better than a vacuum against which to react -- to say that would be absurd. Of course he only seems to lack the knowledge ladled out daily in high schools.\n\nBut there are such things as intentional mistakes or oversights, and, as it happens, Jules Verne, who also knew a thing or two in assorted sciences -- and had, besides, a surprising amount of prophetic power -- deliberately seems to make the same mistake that Professor Goddard seems to make. For the Frenchman, having got his travelers to or toward the moon into the desperate fix riding a tiny satellite of the satellite, saved them from circling it forever by means of an explosion, rocket fashion, where an explosion would not have had in the slightest degree the effect of releasing them from their dreadful slavery. That was one of Verne\'s few scientific slips, or else it was a deliberate step aside from scientific accuracy, pardonable enough of him in a romancer, but its like is not so easily explained when made by a savant who isn\'t writing a novel of adventure.\n\nAll the same, if Professor Goddard\'s rocket attains a sufficient speed before it passes out of our atmosphere--which is a thinkable possibility -- and if its aiming takes into account all of the many deflective forces that will affect its flight, it may reach the moon. That the rocket could carry enough explosive to make on impact a flash large and bright enough to be seen from earth by the biggest of our telescope -- that will be believed when it is done.\n\n-- New York Times editorial, Jan. 13, 1920 (copyright expired)': 3, 'ROFL.

That is a wild silly and specious strawman.\n\nGovernments impose a monopoly on currency use.  Central banks issue this one currency at their discretion.  This enters the system through very low cost loans to chartered banks.  The profits to the central bank is minimal.  The chartered banks essentially have all of the benefits of the ability to create currency. So while it is not at their discretion, they have no limits to access it.  Even when, as we have witnessed, they go bankrupt, the central bank simply provides more even lower cost loans.   They get much base money for close to free.  They then fractionally reserve multiply this into loans and investments.  Because the returns on these are higher and they are multiplied, bank margins are greatly in excess of central bank earnings.  \n\nIf there were competing currencies and the currency issuers were permitted to fail then the market would take care of malfeasance in the long term. It is the monopoly of the currency that creates the power and profits of the banks.\n\nBecause all of: the currency, the central bank and primary dealers/charter banks are highly protected, great excess can grow.  Limiting this excess was the purpose of Glass-Steagall.

Australia does have some antiquated banking policy, and I can\'t blame them for that.So I ask what\'s the fastest way. I get an answer,strangely from the same person,in 24 hours.Not quite the real time responses they advertise, but I assume they must be extremely busy.Was told cash over the counter is the best. So I withdraw from my bank, pay bank fees, travel to their bank and deposit. Not what I would call convenient or efficient but I\'d see what the difference was. Just over 3.5 days!Not what you would call instant.Only other option Bpay,generally the slowest way from my experiences. But strangely  the fastest at Igot at 2.5days I assume they are working on their systems and will improve in time. Made a purchase, no problems there, except one small concern.After hitting the purchase button you are taken to a Confirm/Cancel screen,that\'s ok better to have option to cancel If needed ,but I am happy so I choose confirm.After the Bitcoin rate was different to what I first agreed to.I guess,as it was my first time,I took a few seconds more to read,so maybe the rate changed?At least I understand how it works.The following  time I realise the approve/cancel option doesn\'t show the actual rate you are agreeing to only the amount to be received.A bit odd,but I can click extremely fast, still caught out on higher rates so I\'m unsure.Coin in hand I go transfer some,more  delays. The Bitcoin is instantly taken from your account, but expect a day or two before they actually move them. When asking why,again the same person answered, that\'s how it is, besides everything is done manually at IGOT, and there are only two people in the whole company who can do it. And this is where it gets weird, I love the idea with dealing with local companies.With my preference on small. But with  1-2 days between emails and generally replied to at latenight to very early  morning, or as time went by, no answers at all.Local? Always by the same person, I made a comment that she must be busy, being the only one who was there.Well I got someone else, rudely pointing out they are a big  company with many staff. Ok I\'ve been put back in my place, but as my original query wasn\xe2\x80\x99t addressed I repeated.Afterwards I noticed the writing style was similar to my first contact. Again a bit more back and forth,over days mind you,I was sure it was the same person confirmation when the person accidently signed off with their "real?" name. I Made the biggest mistake when I pointed it out.Explanation, she used the wrong computer,guess it could happen,then things went from bad to Oh my god can it get worse! My privileges (giving them money via Bpay) were revoked until some more bending over, my deposits got lost for weeks, even the banks confirmed they received. More messages over missing funds. And actually, this is how I know there are more staff, I got a message saying the funds still hadn\'t arrived,5 days after their bank confirmed receipt,It was my fault "it\xe2\x80\x99s not our problem\xe2\x80\x9c. But just prior to this message the money was cleared into my account, by obviously some one else. So I reply saying "But I know they are there". While spending most of it over the next few hours. Getting another response " No I just checked again and you have obviously made a mistake, go back to your bank".So making my situation even worse ,common mistake of mine, I opened my big mouth and told her I knew that they were there because I\'ve spent most of it..Could it get any worse, Oh boy it can..I was told I was the rudest customer always complaining.Not the truth,I also give compliments when given good service, but also let people know when the opposite happens.The last problem I could never see coming.I needed to deposit some more funds, and Bpay still was the quickest method, I Bpayed $3,000. Raised a ticket to tell them, if you don\'t I was told, they won\'t look for it. Got a reply saying don\'t send by Bpay as they don\'t offer it anymore.I double checked all my emails, nothing. Had a look over their website didn\xe2\x80\x99t find anything either.Another ticket raised asking where  that information could be found. Told it\xe2\x80\x99s on the payment page, and if I have already Bpayed, that was my fault, nothing to do with them, so good luck getting that back. So I look at the payment page,nothing about the retraction of Bpay. I say I can\xe2\x80\x99t see anything, and  getting more frustrated as the days drag on, but the reply was unbelievable. \xe2\x80\x9cWe haven\'t accepted Bpay for a week, we put a note on the payment page for 3 days then removed it, it\xe2\x80\x99s not our fault that you didn\'t read it in those 3 days, not our problem\xe2\x80\x9d.I apparently had made the stupid mistake of not needing any bitcoin until the fourth day so no message. Good job they are not responsible for"Bridge Out"signs.. It\xe2\x80\x99s incomprehensible  a company would change banking procedure without giving fair notice to customers,but expect they should just know? Now it was urgent,and as no more Bpay, I chose the second fastest method, Cash. So withdrawing again, paying more fees,  re depositing .Told if I get same time transfer, it would be less than an hour. Did this, and informed IGOT, no reply no credit1 hr later ,middle of the day. Still no reply 2 hrs.Sent message.. nothing...4hrs...5hrs..8hrs.. But finally,as I was pulling out my hair watching my window of opportunity close,  I get a response " Due to the fact we feel that you are "NOT HAPPY" we have decided to freeze your account and cancel your contract".... WhatThe??I notice on my computer  my correspondence has been deleted.Making it harder to respond, I find the last one open, and ask what was happening, only to be told this wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the correct ticket to ask on.  I explained it\xe2\x80\x99s the only left. My only guess for removing  the messages was  so I couldn\'t show anyone the ridiculous responses  or the fact so many simply went unanswered. Bad luck, I have been taking copies since things didn\xe2\x80\x99t add up as I noticed that nothing was downloadable on their site. And it\xe2\x80\x99s  good to keep a copy just in case. I must say If it wasn\'t such a serious situation it can be read as very comical,  I am sure sometime in the future I will find it very funny. I asked which of the seven violations I had breached within the agreed contract, causing   termination.Told it \xe2\x80\x9cwas unforeseeable conflict\xe2\x80\x9d, and they would eventually return my money. But not the original $3k because they don\'t have it,  that was my stupid fault. Goodbye.. My bank has talked to theirs, only to find the original money is in their account as the Bpay number was still current when I sent, if it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t it simply wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have  transferred. Their  bank has asked approval for returning the funds, which IGOT hasn\xe2\x80\x99t responded. Procedure then dictates a up to 120 days for them to agree or dispute. If no response, automatically the funds will be returned. My bank has read the correspondence  so they assure me the funds, while  unavailable, are safe and will eventually be returned. They at least got a good laugh at the emails,while trying to assure me they thought it seriously unacceptable. Well at least IGOT made somebody happy.I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry this has been so long ,I guess I needed to get this off my chest. And for anyone who thinks I am bagging IGOT because I\xe2\x80\x99m affiliated with someone else, I can assure you I\xe2\x80\x99m just an investor like anyone else out there, Not big or too small around 60 bitcoin in 30 days, although there system shows about 3xhigher why, who knows? I invest in other markets, but as things are flat and with most the physical metal market closing over Christmas, thought I\xe2\x80\x99d  try.I have asked for Mr Rick Day or anyone else other than my apparent nemesis, to contact me to talk, with no response. My only conclusion is it\xe2\x80\x99s company policy to treat customers this way.So as my own experience has been such a terrible one,I will continue to tell my story and by doing so warn others so hopefully they can be spared. I have been warned  that quite possibly I will receive legal action against me,as the major investors are in the legal fraternity. This will only serve  to cost me more money, and if that is their wish,It can only show their true nature towards customers.I hope that IGOT change their habits, and become the successful company that they should be.Or at least be honest with what they can and cannot do, as most people are understanding of the situation if told the truth. I have read  on the web some other complaints about IGOT, some I sympathise with , others I feel have been too harsh. And some of the internet community have attacked the people telling their story,which I can\xe2\x80\x99t understand.But find it very hard to still read on their promotional spiels, that they are People friendly with  customer driven staff, Real-time responses and instant transfers are still promoted as the normal IGOT experience. Sounds nice, but in reality many customers are feeling \xe2\x80\x9c IGOT shafted\xe2\x80\x9d,\xe2\x80\x9cIGOT robbed\xe2\x80\x9d,\xe2\x80\x9cIGOT ripped off\xe2\x80\x9d.You decide, but at least I told you!': 1, 'Never heard of igot.': 1, "You will have to forgive me, I'm new at this, but trying.": 1, "Sorry, I know I have stuffed some things up, New at this.

However, there are now so many transactions on the network that this cap will eventually limit the capacity of the network. \n\nIt was always known that the cap would need to be raised, and it looks like that point might come in ~6 months [speculation]. If we hit the cap without raising it, miners will be forced to be more selective about which transactions they include in blocks, so the transaction fee needed to get a transaction processed in a reasonable time will increase.\n\nThe reason that changing this limit is a big deal is that most people on the network must agree to the change (it is consensus critical). Let's say 1/3 of people don't agree with the change and carry on running the old software. When a new large block is published, they will ignore it while the other 2/3 accept it.
