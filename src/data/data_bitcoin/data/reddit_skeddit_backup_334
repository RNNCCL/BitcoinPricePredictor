If you lose your seed and still have access to the Trezor you can reset the seed (Send coins to another wallet, reset/wipe Trezor, set up a new Trezor with a new seed, transfer coins back into the new Trezor wallet).\n\nLose your PIN - you can still restore to a new Trezor.\n\nIf you chose to have a passphrase - and you lose or forget it - You have lost your coins - REALLY LOST THEM.\n\nIf the parameters involved in generating HD wallets changed - then we would have an issue for all HD wallets.

Forced obsolescence is when the manufacturer designs something on purpose to make the product useless before it's expected end of life. In those cases, nothing is decided by the manufacturer.\n\nIf you want to start splitting hairs and talk about forced obsolescence in TREZOR, you could consider the fact that the flash is stressed a lot when the PIN is enabled (as the [full storage region](https://github.com/trezor/trezor-mcu/blob/master/firmware/storage.c#L137) is erased/rewritten twice) - but that's definitely fixable and more a rookie mistake than forced obsolescence :)\n\nThe only breaking changes in my opinion are the introduction of a new algorithm at some point of the process of generating an address or signing a transaction that'd require large amounts of RAM (making it impossible to run) or important algorithmic complexity (making it too slow to run, ruining the user experience).\n\nIn my opinion, the likelihood of one or the other happening is low. Extremely low for an algorithm change requiring large amounts of RAM (you usually only end up in that case on purpose - f.e. when designing ASIC resistant hashes), reasonably low for the second one, still developers have to think about things twice when performing low level changes.\n\nTypical corner cases of involuntary complexity today are transactions with a large number of inputs (it takes time to sign each input), or transactions with a large parent transaction (as the amount is not present in previous outputs pointed to transactions, it has to be recomputed by parsing the parent, which takes time if the parent is huge)\n\n> Can stored data on existing Trezor's always be transferred to a hypothetical Trezor 2.0 or competing product or inevitable newer/better systems and technologies?\n\ntoday most features of TREZOR are interoperable, so you're good to go, as long as you don't use TREZOR Connect the way it is implemented today. \n\nFor a longer, almost off topic but necessary explanation on that, this is not me arguing with the competition, this is me stating that an identity protocol **[SHALL NOT](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119)** bind you to a single device or implementation. Websites using the off the shelf TREZOR Connect implementation will only work with TREZORs and not offer a fallback method, so if your device fails, and you don't want to get a new one, you lose your identity.

The number of needed password guesses are actually much smaller than it feels. \n\nBut most importantly is the fact that **huge lists of people\'s passwords are leaked regularly**, which gives crackers a very good tool in their efforts to guess passwords. How do you know that your method to create your seemingly random password and your choice of password components, are uniquely used by only you and not by another human being on this planet?\n\n**We humans have a feeling that our thoughts are much more special and unique than they actually are.** The odds that a seemingly random series of thoughts have been thought by at least one other human, in the exact same order is actually surprisingly high. Heck, even entire inventions (like the invention of the light bulb) are thought of at the same time, but only one of the inventors gets famous so the thought seems unique when it\'s actually not. \n\nWhy is a truly random password important? Because a computer program, not humans, is used to guess passwords, and computers can guess and try passwords extremely fast. **It can try every password in a previously leaked password list very fast without needing to understand the reasoning that was used to create them.** Your opponent may seem human but is actually their computer. They\'re very good at doing the same thing over and over again, like going through a list is. \n\n**Don\'t use your seemingly random thoughts as a source for creating your password.** Use truly random words from a list of truly random words, chosen by a RNG that is known to be good.\n\n**Summarily,**\n\n**I\'d recommend** using the "correct horse battery staple" method (google "correct horse battery staple") a wooden dice and one ordinary paper book dictionary. Then do this to get really random password components of which to create your password from:\n\n1) Throw your dice 3 times. Look up the page number in your paper dictionary, that has the same 3 digit number. Now you\'re on a truly random page.  \n2) Throw your dice 2 times. Let\'s say you got 38 for example. Look up the 38th word on that page. Let\'s say the word happens to be "fantastic". Then "fantastic" is your first password component. Write it down on a paper.  \n3) Do you have 4 words yet? If you don\'t, go to step 1) again and repeat the instructions. If you have 4 words, that means you have all of your necessary password components to be able to construct your fairly easy-to-remember password, for example "fantastic job well done".  \n\n**This way, you now have a truly and not just seemingly easy-to-remember password ("fantastic job well done").** You didn\'t have to trust anyone\'s RNG program because you used a physical wooden dice and a physical paper dictionary instead of a computer program to create your password.\n\nA 4-word truly random password should be enough for any usual purposes like your Facebook password for example, **but please use at least 12 words if your password is used to protect your bitcoin contained in a brainwallet.**\n\nI recommend 12 words because the Mycelium wallet uses 12 words as a minimum for their HD wallet password seed phrase, and I\'ve heard of no one complaining about their Mycelium seed password being cracked.

Just remember that paper wallets can be lost if for example some construction company decides to build a building right on top of the place where you dug your hole for storing your printed paper password (or a part of your password so no one can randomly find and misuse it).\n\nIf you want your family to be able to inherit your bitcoin in case you get run-over by a bus while thinking deeply about your passwords and not looking, you can give half of the password to each family member, and half of the password to be included in your testament.

Or even better if you store your bitcoin in an [m-of-n wallet](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/BIP_0011). But experiment with small amounts first no matter what method you may choose.\n\nWhatever you do, choose a testament solution that makes it possible for your relatives to make several mistakes and not lose all of the inherited coins in just one mistake. Don\'t just assume that they know what they\'re doing when they try to handle large amounts of bitcoin. Remember that you\'re unfortunately no longer available for phone support. If you give them just one private key that controls all of the bitcoin, then they may lose everything in just one second if they swipe the key into on a computer with wallet software that has malware installed on it without them knowing it. It\'s better to have the bitcoin stored in more than one bitcoin address so that they get another chance if they notice that they lost coins not understanding why they lost them. If all goes well (they lose no coins), they\'ll hate you for having complicated things for them by splitting coins into several addresses instead of just one, but it won\'t matter because you\'re dead anyway.\n\nAlso, do all of this *before* your cold storage bitcoin savings have become worth a lot of money (assuming bitcoin will continue to rise very much in value over the years to come).

However, you get an additional small benefit of not having to trust the person who wrote your diceware software that you\'re using. A wooden dice and a paper dictionary can never secretly send every word you look up to a malicious receiver through the internet. If it\'s easy to not take a small risk, then why take a small risk?

So the computer would have to make 360 * 10^9 guesses instead of just 600 000 guesses because your password contains two random words instead of just one random word.\n\nIf you choose a password which contains three dictionary words, the number will be 600 000 * 600 000 * 600 000 = 216 * 10^15 necessary guesses.\n\nIf you choose a password which contains **four truly random dictionary words**, the number will be 600 000^4 = **129 * 10^21 necessary guesses**.\n\nIf you choose a password which contains five dictionary words, the number will be 600 000^5 = 77 * 10^27 necessary guesses.\n\nThe point is that it\'s just as easy to remember four truly random words as it is to remember four truly random letters. But four truly random words are much more difficult for a computer to guess than four truly random letters. How much more difficult?\n\nThere are only 26 possible letters in the English alphabet. So if you create a password with **four truly random letters**, a computer has to guess only 26^4 = **456 976 times**, which is much less than 129 * 10^21 guesses.\n\nThere are only 10 possible "numbers" (as you called it) in the English alphabet, (which are 0-9). So if you create a password with **four truly random numbers**, a computer has to guess only 10^4 = **10 000 times**, which is much less than 129 * 10^21 guesses.\n\n[The U.S. Census Bureau statistics tell us that there are at least 151,671 different last names and 5,163 different first names in common use in the United States](https://www.google.com/search?sclient=psy-ab&site=&source=hp&q=how+many+names+are+there+in+the+world&btnK=Google+Search). 151 671 + 5 163 = 156 834 possible names in total.\n\nSo, let\'s say you have a list of all of those names in a "dictionary of only names", and choose one of those names truly randomly from that list. Then a computer would have to guess 156 834 times to guess your one-name-long password.\n\nSo if you create a password with **four truly random names**, a computer has to guess only 156 834^4 = **605 * 10^18 times**, which is a lot of times, but still much less than 129 * 10^21 guesses.\n\n> What if you threw in some special characters?\n\nThat depends on how large your list of possible special characters is. Do you want to allow your password to contain odd characters such as " \' ", " \\` " or " \xc2\xa7 "? Or just characters such as " ! ", " ? " or " & "? Make a list of your possible special characters and count how many they are. If they are less than 26 unique characters, then creating a password that consists of four such characters would be no more difficult for a computer to guess than an ordinary four letter password would be to guess. It would be more difficult for a human to guess, because who knows how to even type the " ` " character, right? But for a computer that is just a character just like for example the "a" character is.\n\nLet\'s say you want to create a password that contains only truly random lowercase letters and numbers. The password will consist of four characters, **for example "a3b8"**. That would give you 26 possible letters and 10 possible numbers, which would make a list of 26 + 10 = 36 possible characters.\n\nSo if you create a password with **four truly random such characters**, a computer has to guess only 36^4 = **1 679 616 times**, which is much less than 129 * 10^21 guesses.': 2, "> Won't know until the slides are released.\n\nhttps://rya.nc/cracking_cryptocurrency_brainwallets.pdf": 7, "That's correct.

Specifically, I\'m thinking of a sudden (and perhaps unpublished) cryptographic breakthrough that would allow an adversary to forge ECDSA signatures, and spend coins that they don\'t actually own, or potentially, a partial or complete break of SHA256 which might allow an adversary to fork the blockchain in a catastrophic way.\n\nWhile such an event wouldn\'t be the absolute *end* of Bitcoin - the devs would update the ciphers/functions used to non-vulnerable ones, and so on - it would be an enormous blow to its functionality for a time, and certainly to its credibility (and therefore valuation) overall, likely forever. Furthermore, undoing the damage of such an attack might be particularly difficult if the adversary is especially smart, and executes their attack slowly, over a period of time. Since the way to "repair" an attack like this would be to essentially "roll back" the blockchain to the most recent point before the attack began, if the adversary merely steals coins from certain wealthy addresses here and there, piecemeal and undetected, then there may not be a good time to "roll back" to without eliminating potentially weeks or even months of transaction history.\n\nSuch a scenario is the one major thing that makes me hesitant about serious investment in Bitcoin.': 3, 'So how many dollars would that .60 equal?

They did not need to know what was happening with the mineral industry, they did not need to know what was happening in the other sectors using that mineral, they just needed to know their own business, because the price was aggregating the information of all the events happening and conveying that information in a simple number.

Except instead of sending and storing pussy videos, money sends and stores reputation for adding value.': 24, 'You mean like how many chickens a cow is worth?': 2, "The word chicken doesn't use language?": 1}, ('Alibaba & Blockchain Technology Fight Against Counterfeit Goods - Bitcoinist.net', 0): {}, ('The insight here is that in a non-cooperative game (ie competing national governments) the solution to an optimal currency differs from that of trying to create a global money standard.', 1): {'You are stuck with viewing the problem from only the "satoshi" angle, where as Nash is thinking on a grander scale from a different perspective (albeit with bitcoin no doubt in mind).  The "ideal" here is not the stabilization in price that you are referring to but rather a perfect or ideal predictability in relation to the supply of a currency or commodity (or and ideal commodity basket), and the costs associated with producing it.  Nash explains why gold serves this purpose well although does also have historical faults.  There is other commodities that also serve to be at least part of a good basis for money.\n\nBitcoin having a very predictable production or issuance rate becomes a good standard for many all of the reasons Nash lists that gold has historically served this.  \n\n>\xe2\x80\xa6a global money standard could have a value similar to that of standard measures such as those of the metric system.\n\nThe creation or levation of "ideal money" or money with a properly calculated supply/inflation schedule is something that must be brute force with the most powerful computer available-the free market pricing system described by hayek.\n\n>But if, for example, all of the countries of the world would base the value for their national currencies on the value of the British currency then this situation would appear singular and unstable, while it was not so singular for a lot of countries to base their currency value on gold.\n\nIf we are only thinking of whether bitcoin is ideal money, or whether it will have a stable price, then we are not understanding the scope or genius of Nash\'s thesis.  He writes well beyond the introduction of a currency with a stable supply.\n\n>the suitability of such commodities with regard to the ideal function of facilitating utility transfer depends on the extent to which such a commodity seems to have a value independent of its geographical location.\n\n(thx!)\n\nCliffs: it is not a physical standard per se but rather a mathematical relation that nash not only defines and highlights but also extrapolates a solution as to how to implement this standard, using what he calls an "asymptotically ideal money" which is a money what\'s inflation rate tends towards zero.': 1, '\n>I cannot imagine how Bitcoin could get even close to that level of price stability -- and inspire enough trust in its future stability. The idea that it could become a reserve currency is absurd. \n\nThere is some absurdity depending on how we formulate and solve the problem: \n\n>But if, for example, all of the countries of the world would base the value for their national currencies on the value of the British currency then this situation would appear singular and unstable, while it was not so singular for a lot of countries to base their currency value on gold.\n\nI think we are not seeing the picture from the future perspective.  Seems to be a very similar setup as the Bretton Woods, but BW was somewhat manipulable and not stable for reasons stated above. The possibility of a finite internet currency that is immutable and theoretical cost-less to transport (well vs other commodities) creates an opportunity for a stronger standard.  By introducing it was an inflation rate that asymptotically decreases to zero, many of the problems Nash outlines with regards to its implementation are solved...\n\nFrom there the question is how do we get each country to print a money that is ideal in the sense Nash describes and the answer is a natural evolution through the pressure gold 2.0 creates as a universal option to hedge vs inflation. \n\n>The constitutional structure of the authority behind the euro is of the \xe2\x80\x9cpaper money\xe2\x80\x9d character in that nothing is really guaranteed as far as the value of the euro is concerned. But this is typical of all currencies used in the world nowadays.\n\n>Starting with the idea of value stabilization in relation to a domestic price index associated with the territory of one state, beyond that there is the natural and logical concept of internationally based comparisons.\n \n>The currencies being compared, like now the euro, the dollar, the yen, the pound, the swiss franc, the swedish kronor, etc. can be viewed with critical eyes by their users and by those who maybe have the option of whether or not or how to use one of them. This can lead to pressure for good quality and consequently for a lessened rate of inflationary deprecation in value.\n\n>\xe2\x80\xa6my personal view is that a practical global money might most favorably evolve through the development first of a few regional currencies of truly good quality. And then the \xe2\x80\x9cintegration\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9ccoordination\xe2\x80\x9d of those into a global currency would become just a technical problem. (Here I am thinking of a politically neutral form of a technological utility rather than of a money which might, for example, be used to exert pressures in a conflict situation comparable to \xe2\x80\x9cthe cold war\xe2\x80\x9d.)\n\n>Then the limiting or \xe2\x80\x9casymptotic\xe2\x80\x9d result of such an evolutionary trend would be in effect \xe2\x80\x9cideal money\xe2\x80\x9d but this as a result achieved without the adoption of anything like an ICPI index as a basis for the standard of value.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n>\xe2\x80\xa6intrinsically free of \xe2\x80\x9cinflationary decadence\xe2\x80\x9d..a true \xe2\x80\x9cgold standard\xe2\x80\x9d, but the proposed basis for that was not the proposal of a linkage to gold': 1, '> perfect or ideal predictability in relation to the supply of a currency or commodity\n\nIndeed I am lost there.  \n\nOK, bitcoin has a known issuance (inflation) schedule that tends exponentially to zero, and therefore a finite final supply.  Several other things are even better, they already have a finite, fixed supply -- like old (out-of-print) postage stamps, or real estate on the Moon.\n\nI suppose that any transportabe item has a value "independent of geographic location", since any unbalance will be neutralized by trade; unless the item is artificially restricted or banned in some regions, like Bitcoin in China or Ecuador. \n\nBut how could an item, even with fixed or predictable supply, serve as "ideal money" or "global money standard", if its value (defined, say, as its purchasing power against a broad range of goods and services) is not stable?\n\nBitcoin obviously cannot be a reserve currency.  Before it becomes one, its value would have to stabilize.  Or, at least, to become minimally predictable.\n\nThe purchasing power of gold seems to have remained constant, within a a factor of 2, from 1914 to 1971.  I don\'t know why, but I would guess that it was stabilized by monetary management by the US, and perhaps other countries.  \n\nI cannot imagine how Bitcoin could get even close to that level of price stability -- and inspire enough *trust* in its future stability.\n\n': 1, '>OK, bitcoin has a known issuance (inflation) schedule that tends exponentially to zero, and therefore a finite final supply. \n\nNash refers to this as Asymptotically Ideal money, money that approaches a inflation rate of zero with respect to supply at infinite (philosophically): \n\n>It was the observation of a new \xe2\x80\x9cline\xe2\x80\x9d that has become popular...for \xe2\x80\x9ccentral banking\xe2\x80\x9d functions relation to national currencies that gave us the idea for the study of \xe2\x80\x9casymptotically\xe2\x80\x9d ideal money.\n\n>In the near future there may be a smaller number of major currencies...And there COULD be introduced, for example, a similar international currency...\n\n>Now the possible area for evolution is that if, say, an inflation rate of between 1% and 3% is now considered desirable and appropriate in Sweden, then, if it is really controllable, why shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t a rate between 1/2 % and 3/2 % be even more desirable?\n\nNash doesn\'t propose a plan or implementation of Ideal Money, idealness is theoretical, Asymptotically ideal money is his tangible implementation.\n\n>Several other things are even better, they already have a finite, fixed supply -- like old (out-of-print) postage stamps, or real estate on the Moon. \n\nYes and this is why Nash explains the value of these comparisons, but for various reason specific to each:\n\n\n>Perhaps humanity will REALLY arrive at increased wealth if we cansuccessfully colonize lands beyond Terra, like the surfaces of Mars, the Moon, and some asteroids. (But of course we could not illogically claim ALREADY to own the whole Solar System at least, so it is clear that psychological alternatives enter here also with regard to the\nissue of the "true" evaluation of per capita wealth.)\n>\nPossibly the full psychological effect of human "ownership" of the surface of Mars would not be realized until that area had been divided into plots regarded as the private property of specific corporate or personal owners!\n \n>The idea seems paradoxical, but by speaking of \xe2\x80\x9cinflation targeting\xe2\x80\x9d these responsible officials are effectively CONFESSING that, notwithstanding how they formerly were speaking about the difficulties and problems of their functions, that it is indeed after all possible to control inflation by controlling the supply of chips (as if by limiting the amount of individual \xe2\x80\x9cprints\xe2\x80\x9d that could be made of a work of art being produced as \xe2\x80\x9cprints\xe2\x80\x9d).\n\nI can\'t find the comparison to stamps but is about an historical Asian postage system that served as banking/currency for its time. \n\n>I suppose that any transportabe item has a value "independent of geographic location", since any unbalance will be neutralized by trade; unless the item is artificially restricted or banned in some regions, like Bitcoin in China or Ecuador. \n\nWell some commodities have issues in regards to their cost of transport as well, here are some other relatable points:\n\n>Moreover, commodities with easily and reliably calculable prices are most suitable, and relatively stable prices are very desirable.\xc2\xa0 Another basic cost that could be used would be a standard transportation cost, the cost of shipping a unit quantity of something over long international distances.\n\n>Clearly, in terms of this geographical perspective, gold has historically been optimal, largely because the labor cost of moving it over great distances is so small relative to the value of what is being transported.\xc2\xa0 Thus, gold formed a very efficiently movable medium for the transportation of a value exchangeable for other values, ultimately deriving, in one way or another, from human labor (with the achievements of warriors here also being viewed as involving labor).\n\n>Nowadays, however, few would propose a return to the actual use of simply the metal gold as a standard, for the following reasons.\n(i) The cost of mining gold effectively does depend on the technology. Recent cyanide leaching techniques have made it possible again to profitability mind gold at formerly abandoned sites in the U.S. so that it is now a big producer.\xc2\xa0 However, the unpredictability of the cost is a negative factor.\n(ii) The location of potential gold-mining locations may not be \xe2\x80\x9cpolitically appealing.\xe2\x80\x9d so it would seem undesirable to make a political choice to enhance the economic importance of those particular areas.\n(iii) There is some negative psychology about gold such tat even if it were the most logical choice after all, the unpopularity of the idea could be very obstructive.\nHowever, right now platinum would be even better than gold, because it has more value per unit of weight.\n\n>Crude petroleum could also be used for barter transactions, and in view of the present state of the global economy it would seem a proper component of an index of prices of internationally traded commodities that enter into the costs of industrial consumption.\n\nSo for various reasons certain commodities have ideal attributes but there COULD be created or thought of more ideal standards. \n>But how could an item, even with fixed or predictable supply, serve as "ideal money" or "global money standard", if its market value is not stable? \n\nThere are many factors that make up an ideal standard such as how gold had historically functioned for different societies or economies at different times. Nash does in fact discuss when Isaac Newton gave Britain Great Power by tying the British pound to gold (1717?) \n\n>Bitcoin obviously cannot be a reserve currency. Before it becomes one, its value (broad purchase power, in some sense) would have to stabilize. Or, at least, to become minimally predictable. \n\nIt only needs to be more \xe2\x80\x9cpredictable\xe2\x80\x9d in the \xe2\x80\x9cidealness\xe2\x80\x9d sense Nash describes:\n\n>To be quite respectable, in a Gresham-advised sense, money needs only to be AS GOOD as other material commod-ities that might be hoarded.\n\n>There is a problem for the issuer of a currency, whether in coinage, paper, or electronic form, that if this currency (or money) is too good, then it could be exploited by all sorts of parties and interests that might simply wish to safely deposit a store of wealth or even to conservatively invest some assets for future good value.\n\n>But, simply to improve the conditions under which agreements regarding long-term lending and borrowing would be made, a money would be more or less equivalently good if it had a completely steady and constant rate of inflation.\xc2\xa0 Then this inflation rate could be added to all lending an borrowing contracts.\xc2\xa0 Hence, the problem of a money that would be too good is avoidable.\n\nThis is very related to the below.\n\n>The purchasing power of gold seems to have remained constant, within a a factor of 2, from 1914 to 1971. I don\'t know why, but I would guess that it was stabilized by monetary management by the US, and perhaps other countries. \n\nThe problem is that there becomes incentive for each government to be the first to defect irregardless of the peoples wants:\n\n>\xe2\x80\xa6for the government of a state, acting on its own independently of other states, to rationally contemplate the evolution of the inflation rate for its currency towards zero there are clearly some very relevant considerations relating to tax revenue expectations.\n\nSo in the current game the problem has been unsolvable for the peoples who do not control their own monies.\n\n\n\n\n': 1, 'Part of the reason that the Metric System was widely adopted is that it had carefully engineered devices to ensure the stability and replication of the units -- namely, the physical standards stored at the Bureau of Weights and Measures in Paris.\n\nUnfortunatey, bitcoin\'s protocol has no mechanism to ensure the  stability of its price, to a level anywhere near what would be needed to use as a unit for the measurement of value.  This fact was quickly learned by every entity that tried to do its accounting, financial planning and reporting, contracts, or product pricing in BTC -- from SatoshiLabs to the Bitcoin Foundation.\n\nIn fact, as long as bitcoin\'s "21 million cap" is misunderstood as a guarantee of fabulous appreciation,  its price will continue to be set by speculative trading only, unsupported by any fundamentals; and therefore subject to random mood swings among day-traders and investors.
