(Though, of course, the implication that there would be more resources for technical work is something consider positive, at least in the abstract!) ... the notion of bitcoin competing systems continuing their extensive lobbying without that being matched at all is very concerning to me.  But I've certainly not had the time to follow the non-technical developments recently, and perhaps there are reasons why I should be less concerned here.\n\nTaking a card from Peter Todd's deck, I could say that anything so fragile as to be broken by a change in funding direction from the BCF ought to be broken. :)  But I'm not personally worried here.
