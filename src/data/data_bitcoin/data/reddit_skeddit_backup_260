We have a particular use case involving escrow that requires a particular member to signal (in a verifiable way, that uses only info on the BTC blockchain to verify) that they are involved in the multisig txn *before* the escrow address is fully funded.\n\nOne easy (though not optimal) way to achieve this would be to have this member be permanently associated with a particular BTC address that he controls (call it address A). Then, when the 2-of-3 escrow address M is created using pubkeys B, C, and D... The special member can signal that he is involved in the transaction by sending a small amount of coin from A to M.\n\nThe problem with using this (naive) method is that our design goals necessitate that the protocol work even if this special member doesn\'t have access to any BTC. So we can\'t assume that there is any coin in address A that can be sent to M.\n\nAs a modification, I\'m working on a proposal that would create a P2SH escrow address that would require sigs \'A and 2-of-3-of-{B, C, D}\' to spend from escrow.\n\nBefore escrow is funded, A will presign a "blank check" txn spending from M and pass that sig to the other participants. Once the other participants verify the sig, escrow will be funded. The other participants now have (effectively) an old fashioned 2-of-3 multisig situation.\n\nWhen the money is spent from escrow, the redeem script will include a sig from A, proving that the party controlling A admits to having been part of the transaction. Same end result as the naive approach, but doesn\'t require A to have any coins to begin with.\n\nIt sounds weird, I know, but some very restrictive design requirements led us here.\n\nCoupled with other pieces of a trade-flow protocol that we\'ve already ironed out, this could (in the future) be one way to provide cheaper/better/more reliable censorship resistant commitments and storage of negative ratings in OpenBazaar. Our current method has shortcomings under certain edge-cases that can (again, under special circumstances) allow a malicious vendor to censor negative reviews about him from future buyers.\n\nWe discovered that if we can have the vendor signal that he is part of a given escrow txn BEFORE it is funded, then this problem is solved.

Yes, bitcoin will be fine, but the investment space (and likely dev) will suffer. \n\nSuper brief background: \n\nEconomy is at zero interest rates - safe bonds yield no return, equity growth is stagnant, so it\'s hard to make money. This causes a flight to risk, as riskier investments (all else held equal) generate higher returns to compensate for that cost (risk) you\'re carrying. \n\nZero interest rates also mean that money is "cheap." You can borrow it for free, basically. So people are borrowing  a fuck ton of money, taking highly leveraged positions, and investing in risky markets to try to make a buck. This causes localized bubbles, of which 3 major ones are tech, PE, and real estate (varying by geography). I\'m sure there are more, biotech is a good guess, but I don\'t know that space. \n\nAnyway, bitcoin companies are probably the biggest sub market in that tech space. VC money is booming for bitcoin. So what happens when the economy finally enters a recession again and risk appetite dries up? For one, investment in the space will dry up, so dev and products will too. Secondly, bitcoin\'s price performance during a recession is untested. On one hand, you may see a flight away from it (as it\'s volatile and risky). Oversimplifies, the wealth effect argues that when you lose wealth, you dump your risky assets. Bitcoin is the first asset to be sold off to make money to secure positions in remaining assets. It\'s a demands side spiral. \n\nOn the other hand, bitcoin looks more and more similar to gold. It may actually draw investment - and if that\'s the case, the market for its derived products (the bitcoin startups and backing vc firms) will remain secure, using bitcoin to anchor the storm and generate growth. This doesn\'t event address remittance and blockchain use, which can cut operating costs in difficult times. So a recession might be the best thing to happen to the btc market, in the long run. \n\nOne thing is for sure - it will be very scary and very volatile.

It didn\'t particularly coincide with any major economic events. Cyprus, usually referred to as the thing that scared people into a safe haven and hence bitcoin, was bailed out in March 2013. Greece had issues, but Greece has been having issues every 8 months since 2009, and there hasn\'t been a $1000 spike every time they went to the brink with the Troika. The US was doing better, China\'s bubble had not yet burst, Russia had yet to invade Crimea, and there is little in overall macro economics to justify the idea that people fled to bitcoin as a safe haven.\n\nIMO the best explanation for the bubble has been hinted at by tinfoil activists here, and they argue that, after Mt Gox got hacked, Mark Karpeles started using bots on his exchange (by then handling 70% of all bitcoin transactions) in an attempt to drive the price up. His bots would trade with each other, encouraging outside people to trade as well, which puts transaction fees in his pocket while also enabling him to buy at lower prices and sell to outsiders after his bots had driven the price up. If the "natural" price of bitcoin was $100, he could have theoretically bought a bunch, used his bots to drive it up to $1200, sold there, let it collapse again, and then buy back all his hacked coins using the money he\'d raised. Ultimately, either his plan didn\'t work or he executed it poorly, because the exchange still collapsed and he is, last I heard, sitting in Japan waiting to be put on trial for fraud.\n\nI\'m not a financial detective expert, but there are multiple sources easily available on google pointing out large price discrepancies between Mt Gox and its competing exchanges, leading up to November 2013 and even after. Google "MtGox price difference" and you\'ll see multiple results from right around that time.\n\nI think that\'s what drove the pop. After that unsustainable fraud collapsed, bitcoin went back to a more market-based (un-manipulated) level, where it has been more or less ever since.

So my point is, in the perfect world where we have very many bitcoin exchanges (hopefully we get there soon), the only way to pressure the price down is to sell what you have, as opposite to the stock market where you can sell what you do not have and get away with it, regardless the number of exchanges you put in place.\n\nThe reason is because trade and settlement in stock market are two different transaction - trade is instant, and settlement is later.  In Bitcoin trade and settlement is at the same time - you cannot fake the naked short.

I do not support the impractical nature that this sub represents.  On one hand this sub thinks BTC is going to the moon.... With only 21 million btc.  There are 7 billion people on this planet.  Obviously we are enforcing status quo all over gain, except the bitcoin rich are different.  We still have the mark Cuban, Larry Ellison, warren buffet and bill gates of bitcoin.  This completely contradicts the libertarian movement that most bitcoiners subscribe to.  Okay so we can't get rid of classism with BTC, but at least its OPEN and FREE from corruption.  Except you have how many unknowns that hold the keys to thousands or hundreds of thousands of BTC.  BTC hits the moon and now we have the same intentions of using their money to influence others and governments.  Let's for now just ignore the legitimate uses of controlled inflation such as healthcare and welfare..\n\nOkay that's the political side, let's look at the technical side.  BTC is a worldwide currency to enable billions including the unbanked.  Yet we can't agree on a consensus for block size and since we cannot, *we ban discussion on it in a public forum*.  1MB block sizes will really enable billions of unbanked, OK.  Then theres the whole decentralization problem.  We encourage everyone to control their private keys.. But then we require centralized ingress and egress points.  We encourage SPV clients because downloading the entire blockchsin a) takes too long and b) intimidates new users.  **the block chain will only get bigger**, meaning at some point we throw away old transactions (truncate) while relying on a select few (centralization).\n\nSecurity.  We rely on a single nation for the security of the block chain.  No other nation competes with China in this regard.  But hey its okay because if they ever decide to close up shop *consensus* says we can fork and reset the hashrate... Just like we increased the block size.   Then there's the whole elephant in the room of energy consumption.  Never ending increase of energy consumption to record a gyft or purse purchase forever.  \n\nThis post ignores the fact that a centralized few own keys to the alert system!

Took 401k loans to buy BTC.  Begged their parents to give them $5000 for a top of the line BFL miner they never received.  The people who were burned or lost their wallets and realized what it means to be your own bank....and insurance company.\n\nNo way too many issues with bitcoin as a currency.  Block chain technology is cool, but there are hundreds of alts that continue where BTC left off. Litecoin for fast confirmations, dash or monero for anonymity, etherium for robust smart contracts/drm.

Never had he or I ever built stronger, sturdier snow forts.  We would go out at night and pour water on our forts so they would be reinforced with a 3 inch coating of ice.  So strong were the forts they were impenetrable to snow balls.  So we started (much to the concern of our mother) building and throwing ice balls.  \n>   \n> While more dangerous, they were more effective, knocking off a chip of the snow fort here.  A chip of the snow fort there, and then we\'re hurriedly jump out of our forts to repair them while having a gentlemen\'s agreement to then attack the other side of our opponent\'s fort.  \n>   \n> Then something dawned on me.  \n>   \n> If I were to build a simple column of snow on the top of my fort, much like a thick snow flagpole, my brother would be tempted to knock it down.  This would then draw the majority of his fire and munitions, and he would waste those precious resources on a pointless target, while I could reinforce my fort and build more ice balls.  \n>   \n> It worked.  \n>   \n> Once built nearly all of his missiles were directed at the snow column and I was allowed to strengthen my fort.  Occasionally he would hit it, knocking it down and then celebrating.  But I would just put up a new column in a matter of seconds and continue on.  \n>   \n> Naturally, this was quite some time ago.  But what I learned back in 1986 has always carried forward with me.  People like easy targets.  \n>   \n> Now take this fact and apply it to the modern day leftists or liberal. Specifically, environmentalists and protestors.  \n>   \n> Do you know why liberals are protesting fracking in the Bakken oil field?  \n> Do you know why liberals are protesting against nuclear energy?  \n> Do you know why liberals are protesting, well....anything they protest?  \n>   \n> What they will tell you is that they are doing it for some noble cause or another.  To protect the environment.  To protect the children.  To save the whales.  But this is nothing but an outright lie.  However, what\'s really interesting about this lie is that they are telling it not so much to convince you about their nobility, but rather to convince themselves.  \n>   \n> And this is where The Destruction Principle comes in.  \n>   \n> Understand the single most defining characteristic of a liberal or a leftist is that they are lazy.  They do not want to work.  They do not want to strive.  They want an easy and paid-for life as much as possible.  \n>   \n> However, the second most defining characteristic of a liberal or a leftist is their ego.  They have to be applauded.  They have to worshipped.  They have to be doing something that provides them and their ego validation.  \n>   \n> Naturally, these two traits are mutually exclusive.  If you aren\'t going to work hard for a living, if you\'re not going to strive towards something, if you\'re incapable of rigor, then you will achieve nothing noteworthy and your ego will go unvalidated.  However, leftists\' egos are so huge and so hungry they inevitably have to "do something," and so, just like my brother did in 1986, they go for easy, but pointless, targets.  \n>   \n> Going green.  \n> Driving a Prius.  \n> Shopping at Whole Foods  \n> etc.  \n>   \n> All of these things are nothing more than substitutes for hard work, production, self-supportation, and genuine human value.  They are nothing more than rituals, no different than rituals performed at a church.  They are pointless, they achieve nothing, but they make their religious participants falsely "feel good about themselves."  \n>   \n> However, where the "destruction" in The Destruction Principle comes in is where you have your environmentalists or your most vain and vile leftists.  For example, if some dolt wants to buy a Prius and smugly put their MPG on a vanity plate, they aren\'t really hurting anybody.  They are destroying nothing.  But if you have protestors who are going to shut down the Keystone XL pipeline, then you are costing people their lives, jobs, not to mention economic growth for the country.  You are causing destruction.  \n>   \n> And that\'s The Destruction Principle.  \n>   \n> In short, The Destruction Principle is:  \n>   \n> _"Worthless people, in order to validate their egos, but avoid any real work, will take the production, success, and work of others, villainize it, protest against it, and ultimately destroy it.  Not because other people\'s production, success and work was evil, but because it is easier to destroy other people\'s work that already exists, rather that build up something of genuine value yourself."_  \n>   \n> Now, understand just what negative-NPV-humans these vermin are.  \n>   \n> They are so arrogant, so lazy, so full of themselves, they have no problems ruining the lives of others, just so they can feel good about themselves.  \n>   \n> They are so vile, they don\'t mind holding up the economic growth of the entire nation, as long as they can go and protest against "global warming," "patriarchy," or any one of the fashionable leftists ~~religions~~ causes.  \n>   \n> Worse, they are so evil they would rather destroy something that is good, because it\'s easier than working hard and producing something of value themselves.  \n>   \n> Again, look at the Keystone pipeline.  To build that would take engineers, chemists, accountants, and skilled tradesmen.  But look at just one of the [key opponents to it](http://www.boldnebraska.org/jane-kleeb).  A worthless crusader who is deathly afraid of real work, never held a real job in her life, and will ruin the lives of millions to avoid it.  \n>   \n> Now I know I receive some criticism and guff for simplifying things.  But it really is that simple.  People who don\'t like hard work or math are the cause of the majority of our problems today.  People who [major in worthless degrees](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1467978302/) are declaring to the world they don\'t want to work hard, but still want to be in charge.

Governments debts are considered safe because this debtor in particular can force others to pay its debt. But if just holding money in its raw form could be seen as a safe investment, that would likely decrease the appetite for government debt. The fact that most governments will likely continue their reckless deficit spending up until then will also help a lot.\n\nSo, basically, governments would go back to a situation where they\'d have a much harder time contracting debt. Something comparable to governments of the 19th century or before, when the debt had to be paid in gold. That would force governments to spend much less.\n\nObviously, before that happens, we should expect many governments to fight back... in particular those who depend on debt too much.

Plaintiff was one of the people that Watson had asked. Shortly thereafter, Plaintiff replied to Watson, attaching a copy of the \xe2\x80\x9cStrategization\xe2\x80\x9d document containing minor, non-substantive edits.  Plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s edits consisted of (1) adding a photo of and a short biography of himself (in which he refers to himself as an \xe2\x80\x9ciconoclast biochemist turning attorney [who focuses] on understanding the intersection of science, business, and law [and who] will be instrumental to networking, partnerships, and business development efforts of [Ligandal Nanotech]\xe2\x80\x9d and (2) a two-paragraph section titled \xe2\x80\x9cPositioning\xe2\x80\x9d that merely repeated regurgitated the information that Watson and Honkala had written in their original draft of the \xe2\x80\x9cStrategization\xe2\x80\x9d document.

Plaintiff claimed that he had expertise in modeling cash flows and complex market strategy.   Plaintiff claimed that he could also prepare income statements and balance sheets.  Moreover, Plaintiff also claimed that he was an expert in contract law, and that he could prepare contracts and corporate filings on behalf of Watson and Honkala\xe2\x80\x99s proposed company. \n\n> Because of Plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s representations that he could provide legal advice, Watson agreed to consider Plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s request to become part of the company that Watson and Honkala were creating.  \n\n> During the months of May-July 2013, Plaintiff continued his efforts to convince Watson that Plaintiff could provide legal advice and oversee the business development of Watson and Honkala\xe2\x80\x99s proposed company.  Aside from these representations and requests, however, Plaintiff provided no additional edits, suggestions, or other actual work product during this period of time.  \n\n> In reliance on Plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s repeated representations that he would be able to handle all of the company\xe2\x80\x99s legal needs and handle all aspects of the company\xe2\x80\x99s business development, Watson and Honkala hired Plaintiff to be the \xe2\x80\x9cChief Operating Officer\xe2\x80\x9d of Ligandal Tech.  \n\n> Plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s first responsibility as Ligandal Tech.\xe2\x80\x99s Chief Operating Officer was to register and file the required forms to establish the company as a Nevada-based LLC.

Officers\xe2\x80\x9d) asked about the delay in the formation of the Nevada LLC, Plaintiff was evasive, stating, \xe2\x80\x9che was trying to integrate innovation into the bylaws.\xe2\x80\x9d  Upon information and belief, Plaintiff eventually resorted to paying an on-line legal service to create the company\xe2\x80\x99s required formation documents.\n\n> Later in August 2013, because Plaintiff still hadn\xe2\x80\x99t formed the Nevada LLC, the Ligandal Tech. Officers again asked him to form a Delaware C-corporation.  Plaintiff refused, and in September 2013, formed Ligandal Tech. as a Nevada LLC.  Plaintiff did so despite the Ligandal Tech. Officers\xe2\x80\x99 stated preference to establish the company as a Delaware-based C-corporation.  \n\n> In September 2013, Plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s next assignment was to prepare a break-even analysis for Ligandal Tech.  Plaintiff refused and / or was unable to prepare one.\n\n> Also in the beginning of September 2013, the Ligandal Tech. Officers held a board meeting to discuss Plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s inability to complete the few tasks that he had been assigned by that point (like form the company).  The Ligandal Tech. Officers also discussed Plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 inability to get along with potential investors or the Ligandal Tech. Officers.  At this meeting, the Ligandal Tech. Officers and Plaintiff jointly agreed that Plaintiff would be demoted from Chief Operations Officer to Corporate Development Director, that his business development responsibilities would be reduced, and that his eligibility for future distribution of Ligandal Tech. equity would be reduced to 15%.  At this board meeting, Plaintiff acknowledged the damage his shortcomings and intransience had caused to Ligandal Tech. and to the Ligandal Tech. Officers.\n\n> In October 2013, Plaintiff was asked to prepare a consulting agreement.  After several weeks, Plaintiff provided a draft consulting agreement that was riddled with typographical and other errors, and which did not contain any provisions directed to basic issues like jurisdiction and severability.  This consulting agreement draft was the amount of work product that Plaintiff was able to achieve in October 2013. \n\n> Because of the poor quality of Plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s draft consulting agreement, Ligandal Tech. was unable to use it.  Ligandal Tech has since had to pay an outside attorney to prepare one.  \n\n> Also in November 2013, the Ligandal Tech. Officers secured a December 2, 2013 meeting with an angel investment group that had expressed interest in investing in Ligandal Tech.  Plaintiff insisted on making the presentation himself.  As a result, Plaintiff was asked to prepare the presentation materials for the December 2nd meeting and to distribute them about a week beforehand.  Again, Plaintiff failed to achieve this task, and instead submitted an incomplete draft just hours before the meeting was scheduled to begin. \n\n> When the Ligandal Tech. Officers questioned Plaintiff about the poor quality of the presentation materials, Plaintiff became hostile.  He responded that the presentation materials were inconsequential and that he would make up for it with his \xe2\x80\x9cshowmanship.\xe2\x80\x9d  \n\n> Plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s performance at the December 2nd meeting was a complete embarrassment, leading to an abrupt end in Ligandal Tech.\xe2\x80\x99s communications with that angel investment fund.\n\n> At this point, it was objectively clear to all that Plaintiff had severely misrepresented his legal and business expertise and had failed to provide the services he promised in the Aug. 7th Agreement.  Plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s misrepresentations caused Ligandal Tech. to miss several business opportunities.  Moreover, Ligandal Tech. now had to pay outside counsel to re-do many of the documents that Plaintiff had been asked to prepare.  \n\n> In the beginning of February 2014, the Ligandal Tech. Officers and Plaintiff had a board meeting for the purpose of removing Plaintiff as an officer of Ligandal Tech. and removing his eligibility for future distributions of equity.  At this meeting, Plaintiff agreed with his removal as an officer and with his removal from eligibility for future equity distributions \xe2\x80\x93 but requested that he be allowed to resign in order to save his reputation.  The Ligandal Tech. Officers agreed.  Moreover, despite the damage caused to the company by relying on Plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s multiple misrepresentations, the Ligandal Tech. Officers, in good faith, offered Plaintiff an \xe2\x80\x9cAdvisory Board\xe2\x80\x9d position and eligibility for 1% of Ligandal Tech.\xe2\x80\x99s equity.  Plaintiff verbally agreed to this offer.  Before the Ligandal Tech Officers sent Plaintiff a written draft of this agreement, Plaintiff filed this litigation.\n\n> After Plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s removal from Ligandal Tech., Plaintiff returned to New York.  Upon information and belief, Plaintiff made copies of Ligandal Tech\xe2\x80\x99s (now Ligandal\xe2\x80\x99s) confidential information without the prior knowledge or consent of the Ligandal Tech.
