I mean, come on, we don't want our standard of measuring length to become loner (or shorter!) with time - why on earth would we want that for our standard for measuring value?! Money should have constant purchasing power - not one that decreases or increases with time.\n\nSadly, this doesn't seem possible. At least nobody has managed to achieve it yet. The problem is that the purchasing power of money depends on the balance of many factors - and money supply is only one of them. Another is the demand to hold money, yet another is the supply of products you intend to purchase with the money, and yet another is the demand for these products.

The default of debt is the main concern here as that then impacts the systemic flaws within the financial sector. A sector that has debt pumping through its system as its life blood. \n\nDebt is spun and dressed in thousands of complex derivatives.

In the late 1900s, the USA saw moderate inflation but significant increases in real income. \n\nWhen it comes to rapid inflation and deflation, they both occur more frequently and drastically under fiat regimes, than under hard money regimes (I.e. a working gold standard). For example the inflation in the 1920s and the subsequent deflation during the depression were caused by significant growth in the money supply during WWI followed by a drastic reduction in the money supply. Had the money supply remained constant, the overconsumption of the 20s and subsequent underconsumption of the 30s would have been less severe.\n\nThus bitcoin will serve as a stabilizing and beneficial factor in the world economy.': 7, 'NO.

Here is just one example of how SideChains jeopardize the incentives structure in Bitcoin. \n\nlots has been written on this. \n\nsay SideChains exist and one exists that has faster transaction times, and has a set of features that are more amenable to retail, lets call it SC77. \n\nSC77 is widely adopted as it is 100% backed by bitcoin with a 1:1 peg. In this SideChain, it is Merge Mined alongside Bitcoin for security. Miners love mining this coin as they earn extra revenue and there revue grows as the coin grows.\n\n___\n\nOne of the incentive structures in Bitcoin today that may not be widely understood is the use the emission scheme, a **diminishing block reward** that is used as an incentive to secure the network. \n\nTo prevent the miners controlling the Bitcoin network the reward drops every 4 years. Ultimately we get a Nash equilibrium in the Bitcoin mining space, and so long as there are more than just 2 miners competing, competition forces the transaction fee to a cost marginally above the cost to secure the network. The important thing to note here is collusion in Bitcoin mining results in a change of the Nash equilibrium, the result will always be competition to process transactions.    \n\nin just 6 years it is  quite potable that transaction fees in Bitcoin will be greater than the block reward there will be fundamental changes to how the network is incentivized. Energy costs consumed by the network will then start to be dictated by the cost to process transactions, as opposed to today where the energy cost to secure the network is grossly unbalanced, but favors network growth.\n\n___\n\njust imagine a scenario in 6 years time SC77 doses most of the day yo day transactions and many people prefer to be paid in SC77, bitcoin is only used for large deals, like cash real estate purchases and large boats or big international trade deals, but for practicality even home loans and big ticket items like TV's are denominated in SC77.\n\nWhat happens when the Bitcoin rewards diminish, miners get there revenue from the Sidechain. So Miners are economical incentive to mine transaction fees. However if Bitcoin transaction fees move over to a SideChain, and the Bitcoin Block reward diminishes miners will be able to earn revenue on the SideChain while using there mining power to do a malicious attack on Bitcoin with minimal financial loss. The more Bitcoin Block reward droops, the greaterthe threat SideChains proposes to Bitcoin. \n\n\ntl:dr\n\n\nfor Bitcoin experiment to succeed all revenue from mining and processing transactions must be denominated in Bitcoin, SideChains are a threat to the very incentives that make the Bitcoin experiment viable. if we get SideChains as proposed we will end up with a system that is not as efficient as Bitcoin could be, and it will be controlled by those who control the Miners.  \n": 1, 'what will happen if "money" is upgraded? \n\nmost likely the advance of chips will bring artificial inteligence, and robots will make most jobs obsolete, then the distopian future on some sci-fi books where nobody works.': 0}, ('Arthur Levitt: "@BenLawsky, NYDFS, joins me today at 2&6pm to discuss Bitlicense, his regulatory proposal for bitcoin."', 48): {'>http://www.bloomberg.com/radio/': 1, 'i guess not anymore': 1, '[**@ArthurLevitt**](https://twitter.com/ArthurLevitt):\n>[2014-12-14 18:30:44 UTC](https://twitter.com/ArthurLevitt/status/544197816684662784)\n\n>[@BenLawsky](https://twitter.com/BenLawsky), NYDFS, joins me today at 2&amp;6pm to discuss Bitlicense, his regulatory proposal for bitcoin.

Suddenly it WOULD matter that the security of the chain has been outsourced, because without the vote of mining facilities, the innovative chains could not be safely used. In other words, which innovations are usable would be determined by the State.\n\nWhen you put two and two together, you end up with a brutally oppressed and hopelessly centralized system that resembles the modern banking system's wet dream of a globally cashless society, where they get to decide which innovations are usable by the public and which aren't, and financial privacy ends.\n\nEven worse, most people are shilling for this globally cashless system in every language and in every country, voluntarily.\n\n> I want to here your most optimistic scenario following the death of cash by blockchain curren\n\nI'm afraid a positive outcome is not within the realm of possibilities. For all we know, Satoshi was commissioned to secretly work on Bitcoin by a government or spy agency that feared the financial system was coming to an end in 2008. If this is an abuse of trust by Satoshi, then it is a cut and dry case of diabolical evil genius and the end game is nothing short of absolute tyranny and global oppression.\n\nYou have to look over your shoulder just to watch Youtube videos, and it's a chilling effect.

As transaction fees increase, "low value" transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain become increasingly cost prohibitive.\n\nAs Bitcoin scales, mining facilities will only get bigger and more centralized.

It gets easier and cheaper to run a surveillance state over time, so Bitcoin actually does little to bring people financial sovereignty. It actually ends financial privacy altogether. Think about it: Bitcoin literally obsoletes paper notes and fiat currency, imagine if the entire world HAD to use Bitcoin because digital currencies were the only commodity possible to use in commerce. Now financial privacy ends globally.\n\nMost people have no clue how fucked this system is. I mean, our current economic systems are fucked, but if the deep state commissioned Satoshi to work on Bitcoin, then I swear this is nothing other than the oft predicted NWO one global currency. In fact I see no other way of making a one world global currency work other than what Satoshi did, because you need everyone to shill for it in every language on every continent, voluntarily. The way you do that is you introduce a deflationary money which proceeds to eat all other moneys.\n\nKeep in mind Israel, America, Britain, Australia and every other traditional Western power has moved to regulate Bitcoin while fucking Russia decided to ban it.\n\nLook at the replies in this thread:\n\n- "I\'ll take that chance riding the elevator all the way to the top from the bottom."\n- "You can opt out of everything and live in the woods as a hunter-gatherer."\n\nGuess they\'d rather shill for a totalitarian dystopia so long as they\'d be rich in it.

If we move to a cashless society then by defintion you must give up your right to financial privacy in order to be a productive citizen.\n\nIf they figure out a way to make it entirely cost prohibitive to embed data inside Bitcoin transactions, like in the blockchain virus command and control center, this effectively forces all innovation, and lots and lots of people onto sidechains.': 1, 'The internet itself promised to deliver a utopian and egalitarian society.

"This time it\'s different", amirite\n\nYou say it\'s about centralized vs decentralized, but that is a false dichotomy. In proof of work systems, the government controls the land that the mining facilities operate on, and hence the government controls the security of the system. This isn\'t a big deal on the main Bitcoin blockchain, but it IS a big deal if we move to sidechains, because the two way pegged funds in sidechains are dependent upon the largest mining facilities voluntarily agreeing to mine them. In other words, the government must agree to allow the mining facilities to mine a certain innovative sidechain. If the incentives are such that many, many Bitcoiners move onto sidechains we will have put ourselves in a position where the centralized control structures can control the outcomes of Bitcoin innovation by killing off the innovations they don\'t like.\n\nThis on top of giving the tax authorities and spy agencies perfect information about your spending habits.
