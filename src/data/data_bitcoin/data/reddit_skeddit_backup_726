Decentralization implies censorship-resistance and the ability to store and transfer value without having to trust a central authority.  At least to me, those seem like obviously desirable features.  The decentralized nature of Bitcoin is also what enables it to be "deflationary," i.e. have a reliably-fixed supply.  And a fixed monetary supply seems like an obvious plus because it means that no one can steal purchasing power from current holders of Bitcoin by simply conjuring new units into existence.  And finally, *of course* money should be digital.  After all, money is just information and digital transactions can be infinitely more efficient and flexible than exchanging physical tokens, whether those tokens are pieces of paper or bits of shiny yellow metal.

I didn't expect to have them today, yet, here they are!\n\n**Con's**\n\n* Expensive. I think I paid $3 each. I would value them around $2 each.\n\n* The image quality is somewhat grainy.\n\n*  ~~It appears that one side of each coin has the image applied with a sticker. I can't be certain because I'm not ready to destroy on in the name of science. If it is a sticker, it is well applied.~~ It is **NOT** a sticker.

I'm glad I got them, I think I overpaid a bit, but they are a neat possession.\n\n**Update:** I carried these when we went out to trivia with friends..

It's very convenient that you can use your computers without worrying to much about safety and only use your (well hidden) Trezor when needed. In one word the Trezor is excellent. Of course I trust you, however, I'm going to ASSUME you are just trying to steal my bitcoins. For that you only have to broadcast the seed in some secret way through a hidden software and hardware trick within the Trezor (don't tell me this is impossible). The question is: can we defend ourselves against this and the only real solution I could come up with is the following. We need a program running on the computer to which you connect your Trezor that intercepts all (Trezor) output from the usb port and when correct, transfers it to a browser or program like electrum. The Trezor should only output COMPLETELY known, standardized, traffic. The only unknown data should be the public key corresponding to the private key used to sign transactions. This public key can be checked by the program using the signed and unsigned transaction. In this manner we would have an independent program checking the Trezor. The Trezor team could best write the program themselves and publish it on github. Everyone could check the source code and then it would be impossible even for the Trezor team to steal our bitcoins! I know it's a headache but it would mean you (practically) solved the problem of creating a completely safe bitcoin transaction method without third party trust. Your thoughts?": 3, 'Thanks !\n': 2, "I already have Electrum 2.0 working with my Trezor.

Using Microsoft again as an explample: Namecoin forces me to register every variation of my name, and typo before someone else does. The "benefit" of namecoin is that we can\'t prevent a scam site from using a simple typo version of my property.   As a business owner I\'m not excited about Namecoin, it\'s an Arms Race and one don\'t intend to participate in.  So basically I think namecoin is a crap comparison.   \n\nLastly, and most importantly; your solution is simpler for now. It\'s a kick the can down the road solution.  What happens \xe2\x81\xbf years from now when the digits in a transaction id have doubled? Tripled? How long until your method is actually longer than an address?  This alone makes it not a viable solution.
