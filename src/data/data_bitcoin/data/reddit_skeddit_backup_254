If the supply of capital for rent goes down, the interest rate goes up, increasing the incentive to lend. \n\n> There would be investments only in very promising enterprises (i.e. very high yield), which would lead to a centralization not better than today because of the allocation of capital to only a few corporations.\n\nIn response to this, the very point of a market interest rate is to ration limited capital to the highest yielding investments.\n\nLet's say I can utilize some resources and gain a 5% yearly return, and you can utilize the same resources more efficiently and gain a 20% return. Everyone is actually better off if I lend you my resources at an interest rate between 5 and 20 percent. I earn more, you can expand your business, and more resources are used towards your higher yielding purpose. If we somehow artificially lower the interest rate to less than 5 percent, this option disappears. I will be competing against you for limited resources when everyone (me included) would be better off if I didn't.\n\nSo I think the biggest problem today isn't really inflation, but rather that we have removed the very function of an interest rate, which is to ration capital towards the highest yielding investments, not just any positive yielding investment.\n\nArtificially lowering the interest rate isn't very different than lowering other prices. Say we had measures that lowered the price of Lithium. That would mean that more people saw profitable uses for it and would compete for it in the marketplace, leaving less Lithium for other companies like Panasonic who sees profitable uses for it at today's prices. The price of Lithium rations it to its **most** profitable use cases, not just any profitable use case. The price of capital should ideally do the same, but we have unfortunately removed this function to a large degree.

They hit a milestone last month with an annual price drop of 1.4%, the biggest in more than five decades. Even after food and energy prices are stripped out, core prices fell 0.7%.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s hard not to call that deflation,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jennifer McKeown of Capital Economics, referring to the technical term for a sustained slump in consumer prices.\n\nAnd yet evidence of deflation\xe2\x80\x99s pernicious side effects\xe2\x80\x94recession, weak employment, rising debt burdens\xe2\x80\x94is pretty much nonexistent in Switzerland. Its economy is expected to expand this year and next, albeit slowly, in the 1% to 1.5% range. Unemployment was just 3.4% in September. Government debt is low.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cUsually people associate deflation with depression,\xe2\x80\x9d said Charles Wyplosz, a professor at the Graduate Institute in Geneva. \xe2\x80\x9cIn the Swiss case, the economy is doing OK.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSome of that success is due to the shattering of another long-held maxim: that central-bank policy rates can\xe2\x80\x99t go negative to offset the effects of falling prices.\n\nSwitzerland, in a bid to sap demand for the franc and drive down the currency\xe2\x80\x99s value, has a -0.75% rate on certain deposits parked at its central bank, meaning financial institutions pay to keep their money there. This effectively amounts to a negative real, or inflation-adjusted, policy rate because core inflation is typically a good indicator of underlying price pressure. Denmark and the European Central Bank have taken a similar path with their deposit rates.\n\nAlthough wage growth has slowed in Switzerland, it was 0.6% on an annual basis in the second quarter, which combined with falling prices means strong real pay gains, boosting spending power. Meanwhile, the rate on a 10-year mortgage is only around 2%.\n\nENLARGE\nFor years, central banks from Japan to Europe and the U.S. have been fighting mightily to buck up their inflation rates and escape the deflationary trap. The concern: that falling prices will prompt consumers to spend less\xe2\x80\x94based on expectations that prices will continue to decline\xe2\x80\x94and businesses will delay investment amid uncertainty about revenues.\n\nThe Great Depression and, more recently, Japan\xe2\x80\x99s two-decade struggle with deflation, are typically cited as Exhibits A and B on why central bankers should do all they can to avoid the trap.\n\nThe Federal Reserve spent trillions of dollars from 2008 to 2014 on government bonds and mortgage debt to combat this risk. More recently, it opted to keep interest rates near zero six years into an economic recovery with the unemployment rate barely above 5%, in part because inflation is so low\xe2\x80\x94unchanged over the year ended Sept. 30.\n\nMajor central banks prefer annual inflation of about 2% to provide a cushion against deflation.\n\nFaced with stagnant consumer prices, the ECB is in the midst of a \xe2\x82\xac1.1 trillion ($1.249 trillion) bond-buying program. The Bank of Japan has purchased broad swaths of public and private assets, too. The reasoning behind all these moves is that once deflation becomes entrenched, it is difficult to reverse.\n\nBut in Switzerland\xe2\x80\x99s case, falling prices, brought on in large measure by what most analysts see as a significantly overvalued franc, has generated some positive fruits. It has forced companies to raise productivity and stay competitive in global markets, particularly compared to the rest of Europe.\n\nDespite the franc\xe2\x80\x99s strength, Switzerland\xe2\x80\x99s trade surplus was nearly 5% of gross domestic product last year, suggesting its products are still competitive globally. Consumer spending continues to grow, albeit at about half the rate of three years ago.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have to distinguish between good and bad deflation,\xe2\x80\x9d said Alexander Koch, economist at Raiffeisen Schweiz in Zurich. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s no crash, no strong increase in unemployment in manufacturing and as there are no bursting bubbles in other sectors, domestic demand and the labor market are quite resilient.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nMaybe it\xe2\x80\x99s the Alpine air, but economists at the Basel, Switzerland-based Bank for International Settlements\xe2\x80\x94a consortium of central banks\xe2\x80\x94have also challenged some of the conventional wisdom on deflation\xe2\x80\x99s pernicious effects.\n\nIt may have negative consequences, but \xe2\x80\x9con the other hand, deflation may actually boost output,\xe2\x80\x9d they wrote in a March report. \xe2\x80\x9cLower prices increase real incomes and wealth. And they may also make export goods more competitive.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSo why aren\xe2\x80\x99t central banks embracing the Swiss example? Analysts note that it\xe2\x80\x99s difficult to distinguish between good and bad deflation until it\xe2\x80\x99s too late.\n\nNor is Switzerland without its own struggles. To keep the franc in check, the central bank may be forced to cut the deposit rate even further, analysts say, particularly if the ECB eases policy more. Super-low rates on mortgages and other forms of debt could create housing and other bubbles. An abandoned effort to cap the franc\xe2\x80\x99s value to the euro led the central bank to book a loss of 50 billion francs ($52.45 billion) for the first half of the year. And average consumer price levels are still quite high compared to the rest of Europe despite declines in recent years.\n\nBut, says J\xc3\xb6rg Kr\xc3\xa4mer, chief economist at Commerzbank in Frankfurt, Switzerland\xe2\x80\x99s deflationary experience shows that for some, it\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cnot as harmful as most people think.\xe2\x80\x9d': 36, "> This statement I don't understand.

Where that risk is likely, some rational agents will choose buy property under interest-only mortgaging, rent, and then after deflation becomes substantial, default on the loan.

Renting supply would be flooded, and renting prices would be driven down close to interest rates. Renting property would become very cheap. \n\nThe banks themselves wouldn\'t want this situation, since it increases their default risk. They want it to be in the interest of rational agents to pay off their loans in a timely manner. To incentivize that, I\'d assume they\'d offer protections against runaway deflation.

Because doing so offers you the possibility of earning an even greater return.  If your savings are increasing in value because the currency unit is increasing in value, that's nice. If you can also increase the quantity of your savings by profitably lending or investing them, that's even better.  \n\nAlso consider that when you save money, you are in effect making an investment in the overall economy.  Money is never really the thing that's invested.  What's actually invested are scarce resources.  Money allows you to make a claim on scarce resources.  When you don't exercise that claim immediately (i.e., save your money), those resources remain available to be used by others.  You've effectively made a *loan* of those resources to the rest of society.

Compared to public blockchains, they have a number of advantages:\n>1. The consortium or company running a private blockchain can easily, if desired, change the rules of a blockchain, revert transactions, modify balances, etc. In some cases, eg. national land registries, this functionality is necessary; there is no way a system would be allowed to exist where Dread Pirate Roberts can have legal ownership rights over a plainly visible piece of land, and so an attempt to create a government-uncontrollable land registry would in practice quickly devolve into one that is not recognized by the government itself. Of course, one can argue that one can do this on a public blockchain by giving the government a backdoor key to a contract; the counter-argument to that is that such an approach is essentially a Rube Goldbergian alternative to the more efficient route of having a private blockchain, although there is in turn a partial counter-argument to that that I will describe later.\n\n>2.The validators are known, so any risk of a 51% attack arising from some miner collusion in China does not apply.\n\n>3.Transactions are cheaper, since they only need to be verified by a few nodes that can be trusted to have very high processing power, and do not need to be verified by ten thousand laptops. This is a hugely important concern right now, as public blockchains tend to have transaction fees exceeding $0.01 per tx, but it is important to note that it may change in the long term with scalable blockchain technology that promises to bring public-blockchain costs down to within one or two orders of magnitude of an optimally efficient private blockchain system\n\n\nThe point is: Banks/Fintech-startups are taking what they think is the best parts of the Bitcoin/Blockchain technology, and adapting it for their own use.

So the "alternate solutions", are not what you imply: I haven\'t heard any of them suggest they want to prevent a lightning network type of solution.\n\nBut lightning network is not running code. The block size increases are relatively quick changes which could be done with consensus, and in fact, they would help to enable additional transaction layers on top, like lightning network, since it would help to reduce the crowding in the blocks and pressure on the transaction fee.\n\nEdit: What did I say that was so controversial?

An optimal rational miner would be best off forking off the current best block in order to capture its fees, rather than moving the blockchain forward, until they hit the maximum. That\'s where the "backlog" comment comes from, since when there is a sufficient backlog it\'s better to go forward.  I\'m not aware of specific research into this subquestion; it\'s somewhat fuzzy because of uncertainty about the security model. If we try to say that Bitcoin should work even in the face of most miners being profit-maximizing instead of altruistically-honest, we must assume the chain will not more[move] forward so long as a block isn\'t full.\n\nThe scenario described above doesn\'t work. The incentive to move forward is not challenged by large blocksizes and low block subsidies\n\nLet\'s say some miners are adopting that strategy. Ten different miners have published blocks at block height X. These blocks vary from 10% full to 100% full. An eleventh miner is now mining a block. This miner could make a 100% full block at height X, but the chance that it would be part of the main chain is very small. Alternately, he could build at height X+1, which gives him a much better chance. If he does so, he can choose whichever block to build on that he wants. If he\'s selfish, he\'ll choose the smallest block, since that leaves the most fees for him. This means that large blocks will have a much higher chance to lose orphan races. This makes the strategy of intentionally orphaning blocks a non-starter unless the miner has a large enough proportion for selfish mining effects to be relevant.': 4, 'Hi to (hopefully) some core devs.  Quick question for all of you.

I\'m confused why there\'s two points of view on how we get there, but such a vastly different definition of where "there" is.  \n\nOne party is completely content with 8MB for the next X years and will not enable lightning network transaction-volume-capability until the year 2035.

I think it\'s a been well-established at this point that it\'s the banking and financial systems network that is going to have the largest value from using the bitcoin protocol.  They are the ones with the incentive. These are established companies that would like to save money. I\'m not saying let\'s make bitcoin a banking tool.

The most the attacker could get is 21 million bitcoin, as any value higher will be proof of fraud.\n\nSecond, it doesn't matter if an attacker can get infinite bitcoins when the amount of goods they can get in a given amount of time is limited. Remember that such an attack would quickly be uncovered, since only a download of the full blockchain is required to prove it, and a massive reorganization would signal the introduction of the fake UTXO checkpoint. \n\nIf for instance it takes 6 hours for every BTC-accepting merchant to stop selling merchandise for BTC, that means the attacker has to be able to clear out enough of the inventory of hundreds of thousands of merchants with BTC in a much shorter period of time than 6 hours (since most merchants would stop accepting BTC well before six hours), to make up for the massive cost of all of the mining equipment required to outrun the rest of the mining network for months/years. \n\nThere are so many practical difficulties and potential problems in conducting such an attack and actually making a profit off of it, that I don't believe we need to worry about it. Just thinking through what such an attack would take, I think the odds of it happening are astronomically low. The benefits to Bitcoin, in giving tens, if not hundreds of millions of people access to the blockchain, far outweigh the risks of opening up the network to some cataclysmic 5-years-of-PoW 51% attack, of moving to a PoW-based checkpoint system IMO.\n\n>Then keep in mind that the hashrate has grown exponentially so 5 years of mining is nowhere near as expensive as it sounds.\n\nBoth the growth of BTC's value, and the growth of mining cost-efficiency, will decrease as the Bitcoin economy matures, so at equilibrium, even assuming Moore's Law continues, the cost of generating 5 years worth of PoW will be much more than the cost to do so now.": 2, 'I see..

So one shouldn't worry all that much (but not ignore it).\n\nInteresting slides nonetheless, has the talk been recorded?": -2, "> How could they insert their own fake UTXO entries and have the rest of the mining network accept (build on top of) the UTXO commitment?\n\nIf the blockchain is huge then miners will not run full nodes.\n\nTheir security will be the same as the rest of the network.\n\n(I wish this wasn't true, but SPV mining is already a thing today.)\n\n> If for instance users trusted UTXO-commitment-checkpoints 5+ years back, it would require generating an amount of proof of work equivalent to what the network produced in the last 5 years, at the very least, for a dishonest miner to get the user to accept a fake UTXO entry.\n\nI'm assuming that by UTXO commitment checkpoint you mean there is a third party verified (block_height , utxo_root_commitment) pair.\n\nAssuming we trust the third party (a 5 year old commitment checkpoint is probably safer than the code for sure).\n\nThe cost to get around the checkpoint is 5 years of mining.\n\nThe problem is that the reward for cheating and building a fake UTXO commitment is literally **INFINITY** bitcoins.\n\n(Remember that the reward for building a fake chain is maximum 21 million bitcoins if everybody is using full nodes).\n\nThen keep in mind that the hashrate has grown exponentially so 5 years of mining is nowhere near as expensive as it sounds.": 0, '> Neither will miners immediately start mining big blocks on day 1.\n\nIt\'s almost as if some people are intentionally misunderstanding the word "limit" in order to spread FUD. \n': 11, 'How are UTXO set commitments centralization?': 2, "How does the cost to resizing a hashtable equate into its lookup *complexity*?\n\nI mean, I get what you mean, but for two hastables: one of size x, the other of size y, the lookup complexity is O(1) for both.

With UTXO commit checkpoints, you're validating all of the blocks that came after the commitment for yourself. \n\nThere is also the fact that with SPV, an attacker only needs to outrun the rest of the mining network for whatever number of blocks SPV-merchants require for confirmations, which right now is often 1, and even in conservative cases, 6, and so can have a very small share of the hashrate and still manage to pull off the attack, while with UTXO-commit checkpoints, it can be 5 years worth of blocks, which means the attacker needs more than 50% of the hashrate to have any realistic chance of pulling it off.\n\nSo I don't see how it's in any way comparable.
