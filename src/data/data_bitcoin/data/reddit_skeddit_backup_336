Its just a way to make javascript files act like a serverside deployment - in other words you can have server with single code reference and that code refrence deploys endpoints exposed to the user - at the same time you have a client library that is loaded whenever your customer loads the page, that client-side code works in conjunction with your server side scripts.  Your server side scripts handle things like private keys, validations, and balances - the client side handles the actual application parts that would be too heavy to calculate and transmit across the network...at least that's my understanding of how and why node.js is used rather than something else, like php.

If it\'s such a slam dunk case against them, why are those clients not in prison?

Why should someone lose their bank account just because the US DEA doesn\'t like them?\n* Millions of dollars of suspicious travellers cheques. Again, suspicious according to who? Anything can be labelled as suspicious in hindsight. The vagueness of this standard is what I\'ve called out above as legally problematic.\n* A resistance to closing accounts linked to suspicious activity. Again, suspicious according to who? The DEA? They have a direct incentive to label lots of people as "suspicious" if they think it\'ll help them do their job, as there are no consequences for the agents involved. The reasons we have courts and laws to decide guilt or innocence is exactly to stop this kind of ad hoc punishment.\n\nIn the UK the banks have been trying to cut off remittances to the entire nation of Somalia: only a court order is keeping the financial connection alive. The reason is, the banks are terrified of being found guilty of allowing "suspicious" transactions to "suspicious" people there, so by their calculus it\'s better to block ALL transactions. Quite a few families in Somalia depend on remittances to buy food. However the banks fear the US Treasury dept more than they fear creating thousands of starving families.\n\nWhen you support these sorts of attacks on HSBC, that\'s the eventual consequence: a financial system paralyzed by fear that systematically excludes people based on race, nationality, background .... anything that some US bureaucrat might later decide is "suspicious".': 3, "Yes.

Have the person generate their own QR code and give you the public key to press onto the bill. It could be done but it wouldn\'t be as appealing as all the customization you can do when you\'re designing the whole note in one go. You\'d be stuck with only one version of the QR code, really, and it\'d pretty much have to be black and white -- which very little "real" money is. \n\nWould be really fun to have some kind of thing where you go around taking people\'s photos and then handing them little squares that have their photo underpinning a QR code. The QR code is a nominal amount of BTC you\'re paying them to use their photo on your new website, which would be called "Bitcoined" or something. The device is what I\'m talking about that would be cool. I just can\'t see it being very feasible.\n\nJust to let you in on what started my rambling, it\'s this whole idea of private key holding. It\'s the only reason paper wallets aren\'t the best way to do things IRL, and perhaps a big drawback to adoption. When we first get to Bitcoin we think of money in units. A $100 is 5 $20s, and in our mind there is no important difference between the two. With Bitcoin we see there is really only one large number that encompasses all of it, and only portions are divided amongst these various "wallets." This is really hard for someone to conceptualize because it\'s entirely different. If someone hands you a $10 bill, a single unit, you can assume that it is a $10, except if it\'s counterfeit. Even if a corner is missing, it\'s still worth $10 or can be exchanged for as much. With Bitcoin if someone was holding the private key at the same time as you, they could easily start siphoning off small amounts as time went on, and it\'d be difficult for you to notice. You\'d be forced to sweep the coins to another address. This is the fundamental barrier part. People have to want / know how to make that next step. \n\nSo I\'m having a lot of thoughts around this, and another might be that there needs to be a tertiary stage: the redemption. So the paper wallet should clearly be saying "worthless until redemption." Then the user creates their Bitcoin wallet and goes to the redemption place. Maybe it\'s a site they can use their iPad with or something. This then sweeps the funds to their real wallet, effectively having them now as owners of the Bitcoin. \n\nSimply having a culture where we can Indian-give the BTC at all times won\'t work. Either something like what I\'ve described could be created, or some new addition to the software could be created, some new type of address that would be "transferrable." What I mean by that is, even if the creator of the private key knows it, it doesn\'t work once they\'ve transferred it, it mutates into a new one, or something.': 1, '*Bitcoin - Be Your Own Bureau of Engraving and Printing*\n': 4, "Apologies.

A while ago there was a discussion here about what whether that should all go in a single pool and everyone get paid in proportion to what they lost, or whether the bitcoins should be split among bitcoin creditors and the cash among cash creditors, or the bitcoins traced back based on who paid them in and some lucky people get all their bitcoins and some get none, or what.\n\nIf you imagine a dry cleaner\'s had gone bankrupt with a bunch of people\'s clothes, those clothes still belong to the original owners. So the bankruptcy trustee tasked with dealing with the mess would probably ask people with clothes there for cleaning to come and collect their own clothes, then sell any remaining assets and divide them up against the normal creditors. What they wouldn\'t do would be to sell all the clothes, assign the cash value of their clothes to the owners and pay the owners in proportion to the remaining assets.\n\nOn the other hand, if a bank goes bankrupt, money is completely liquid and fungible, so even if you could prove that they still had _your_ $10 note, and they\'d lost somebody else\'s, you wouldn\'t get any special treatment; If the bank only had 20% of the assets they owed, you\'d only get $2 back.\n\nSo this unlucky Japanese court has been lumbered with deciding whether the bitcoins at Gox are like dry cleaning or like cash in a bank. Until now the Japanese government had been saying (based on their interpretation of the law) that bitcoins were "things" rather than money, which made it sound it like the dry cleaning interpretation may apply. But this court seems to have said that no, you don\'t have particular ownership over particular bitcoins held at Gox, so the bankruptcy trustee can carry on doing what he seems to be doing and give all the bitcoins a cash value (I\'m not sure if this will involve selling them or not) then paying all the creditors out pro rata.\n\nI don\'t know what the legal reasoning is but this seems like the fairest way to do it.': 82, 'All of you are right.

Do they honestly think that Wells Fargo owns the money and valuables they transport in their armored cars?  No, it\'s called bailment.
