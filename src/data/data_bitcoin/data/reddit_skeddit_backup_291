If that spurious traffic could be eliminated, the traffic would be perhaps less than 100 kB/block, and the block size limit would be less urgent.  It would still be a good idea to increase it, though, to lessen the risk of spam attacks.   \n\nI have a proposal to try to get rid of that spurious traffic, which is to impose a significant transaction fee, say 0.001 BTC.  It would perhaps cut half or more of the spurious traffic, without inconvenencing the legit uses.  It would also provide a better incentive for miners to fill their blocks and thus improve the quality of service.  But, not surprisingly, that idea is not popular.  \n\nSo that spurious traffic is not going away, and at the present rate it will reach capacity in mid-2016.  What will happen then?  Will the congestion affect only the spurious traffic, while  the legit traffic will go through with no delay, by paying sightly higher fees? Or will the congetion affect the legit traffic too, and result in the user base shrinking even more?  It seems rather irresponsible to let that happen... for no good reason whatsoever.\n\nBut the user base and legit traffic *shoud* grow more, because there must be more people who would need bitcoin -- not to replace Paypal or Visa, but for occasional payments for which bitcoin is better.  If 1 billion people have a need for bitcoin once a year, on average, that would be 2.7 million transactions per day, or about 14 times the current capacity.  \n\nWill bitcoin usage grow to those levels?  Not while the price continues to be volatile, unfortunately.  We can only hope that speculation will stop and the price will crash to the level predicted by usage -- which should be a lot more more stable.\n\nThe current push to increase the user base is totally wrong.

At least not a fork that significantly changes the nature of the future of bitcoin.\n\nIf you have 4 proposals, and depending on the major players, that are favored by 25% of the significant voters, and each voters refuses to allow contrasting proposal to gain majority, it seems to me that consensus would be impossible. \n\nAdding proposals increases the fragmentation, it doesn't help things.  And the last piece is that knowing there won't be a consensus causes each of the 4 x 25%er's (im sure even less division is needed) to weigh the possibility of cooperating with another proposal vs for example no consensus (1mb).\n\nSo provided there is a Nash equilibrium in which there can be no unilateral gain, you have an incredibly stable situation that can only be changed through complex cooperative action which would be provided empirically at this time we are not capable of. \n\nI think me and Satoshi wanted this, not sure if anyone else sees value here.\n\n": 3}, ('Comparison of BTC Escrow/Arbitration Companies', 5): {'Thanks !': 1, 'Have you used this service before?': 2, "I just searched the web, what I was really looking for was arbitration / escrow companies.

That's a possibility to be aware of, just like a bitcoin 51% attack.": 2, 'FWIW, here are a few personal thoughts. I think some people share these ideas but I know some others have very different views on these matters. So, up to you to build your own opinion ;)\n\nOne of the great things with the initial design of bitcoin is the financial incentive to secure the network by running a full node (thanks to mining and blocks rewards).\n\nUnfortunately, centralization of mining in pools breaks this genius idea. Today, there isn\'t enough pools to imagine a network in which full nodes are only run by miners/mining pools (Satoshi\'s initial vision).\n\nFor now, the "patch" used to solve this problem is built upon:\n\n- commercial entities running full nodes because they\'ve an external financial incentive (web wallets, exchanges, monitoring, ...) \n\n- individual unpaid hobbyists. \n\nIMHO, reintroducing in the system a financial incentive for full nodes would be a good idea.\n\n\nLN may help in several ways:\n\n- software client being at the same time a LN node & a bitcoin full node (as proposed in your post)\n\n- services provided by full nodes (like serving spv wallets) monetized via micropayments over LN.\n\n- [put your own idea here...]\n\n\nFor the record, I also think this kind of solution will imply new challenges. \n\nFor example, it\'s likely that financially incentivized nodes will come with more "proxy nodes" ("fake" nodes run by a same entity, backed by a single db, but serving SPV nodes as intended). That may be a problem if you see the number of full nodes as a proxy metric for measuring decentralization of the network. IMHO, this metric is already too weak to serve this purpose but that\'s another story... \n\nAs a conclusion, I like the idea of financial incentives to increase decentralization and network effect. Lately, JoinMarket (incentivized privacy with coinjoin) seems to me like a good example of this kind of model.': 7, "I was just asking about how it would be done as I am not familiar with the LN as much of the discussion I see surrounding it is too technical for me. I was just asking if the mechanism is like the PoS mechanism where you run a node out of your wallet with funds and you earn a return on those funds, but it seems like, from your explanation, it isn't similar to that.": 1, 'I really hope LN comes to fruition.': 21, "If LN is up and running quick, while the block rewards are high, bitcoin's utility will 100-double": 8, 'So what if they do?': -3, "Ah ok... that's great!": 1, 'I hope everybody can do this in the well-known decentralized fashion!': 1, "That doesn't exactly answer my question. Presumably running a Bitcoin node and a lightening node both require separate resources. ergo there is a financial incentive to separate the two. Doesn't this mean there would need to be some sort of unbreakable link between them?": 2, "> I rarely hear anyone talking about it. Is it worth the time to set it up?\n\nWell hype isn't everything. There have been plenty of hyped up bitcoin projects that never amounted to much.\n\nIn terms of returns for running a market maker bot, since it's essentially risk free you don't get that much return. Maybe low single digit percentages per year (and it's only been running for ~4 months and who knows what will happen when it gets easier to use)\n\n> From a scalability standpoint, joinmarket decreases the network's transaction throughput while LN will increase it, which is a plus. It also seems to me that Lightning Network could prove to be a superior mixer as well...\n\nNot necessarily, if you combine many economic transactions into one bitcoin transaction with joinmarket and coinjoin it actually reduces the load on the network.\n\nLN and JM solve different problems, it's not either/or.
