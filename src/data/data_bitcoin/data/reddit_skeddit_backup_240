It's fairly simple to stay in business for any long period of time they need to develop a relationship of mutual trust with their regular clientele. This establishes a reliable stream of revenue  that doesn't risk falling into a police sting or running into a violent weirdo. The main alternative method to this are guys who insist on never making connections and never selling in the same area of a city twice.

In general you can always assume that gang violence is a bigger deal in the media than it actually is in real life, because reporting on it brings in channel views. Retirees who watch Fox News all day will watch anything you show them to reinforce the idea that there are huge gangs of drug using black kids killing people all the time. When in reality despite gangs generally being involved in illegal activity they fundamentally want the same thing as everyone else, stability and capital. So if a bunch of people are getting shot in a gang\'s territory that generally means they\'re having trouble staying in charge. \n\nNow violence related to the drug trade is a big deal, after all it makes up like 60% of all murders in the US. Side note the only demographic of murder that even comes close is domestic violence leading to death which is also staggeringly high. The problem with using something like the Silk Road to fix drug violence is that the vast majority of it happens at the very high end distribution side. The guys smuggling in boat loads of cocaine from other countries, the guys who control all the product in an entire city, etc. These are not the small time operators who use the Silk Road, and they won\'t change over to the Silk Road.\n\nNow I\'m sure the idea that immediately comes to mind is "why don\'t people use sites like the Silk Road to undermine vast drug empires". Which is sadly only really feasible for a tiny minority of drugs like marijuana which is fairly easy to make by a single person; and honestly that\'s probably going to be legalized quicker than you could make an actually secure website to illegal distribute it anyways. The amount of influence and physical presence needed to import say cocaine from South America or research chemicals from Russia means that it basically all of the drugs on the Silk Road of their type went through the hands of these cartels at one point or another.\n\nThe easiest way to reduce drug violence is just to not do drugs, and not facilitate drug use in others. If you must though work for legalization and don\'t deal with anything that needs to be imported, which is basically everything besides pot.\n\nQuick note: All of the above is general information based on experience in a densely urban region of the Midwest of the US. Things may be different on the coasts or in other countries. Also none of this applies to guys who run meth labs, they\'re fucking nuts. It\'s too easy to make and there are way too many competing meth labs in the US for any sorta of coherent market to stabilize. So they tend to go all chainsaw massacre on each other in fights over the incredibly tiny markets they each service. Spill over violence is much more common with meth but the pattern of distributors attacking each other way more often than their customers holds true.': 3, 'Plus they tend to take a dim view of order hits on people and whacking innocent roommates let alone other convictions.

I haven\'t taken the time to figure out what the figure would be, but Visa\'s market cap is due to it earning profit on every transaction. Bitcoin is not in such a position, so being used purely as a payment rail may result in low enough demand for bitcoin (in a buy and hold sense) that it doesn\'t even capture that $200 billion USD market cap.

That has little to do with bitcoin.  Banks could be sitting on vaults filled with gold, or cash, or paintings.  \n\nFractional reserve banking is a good thing imo.  It creates a natural conduit for credit creation.  And while it produces greater systemtic risks, as you note, bank runs did indeed used be a common occurrence and led to many people losing their life savings.     ': 1, '[deleted]': 1, 'Yeah, the real innovation isn\'t a shared ledger, or even the "trustless" nature of the blockchain. It\'s the brilliant harnessing of competing interests and incentives that renders the system stable. And I haven\'t seen another shared ledger system yet that does such a good job of that.': 2, 'No, bank runs aren\'t tied to fractional reserve banking, and they were far more common before the invention of the Federal Reserve, since depositor\'s insurance gives depositors a lot of confidence.  Even if a bank swears they have 100% of the gold in reserve, they could still face a run if depositors don\'t believe them.  Yes, bitcoin could help in this very limited scenario.\n\nCredit is a critical part of all economies.  Without it, you have a Marxist world where only those who already own capital can produce anything (and even the best producers are limited in their ability to grow, produce more jobs and goods, etc).  Credit allows the entrepreneur to start a business, or the brilliantly profitable business to expand more quickly.  Obviously wonderful things for the economy and society at large.\n \nSo then the question is who should be extending the credit?  Traditional commercial lending (taking in deposits and making loans), is directly tied to fractional reserve banking.  It\'s how savers get to earn interest on their savings.  If instead you mandated that loans can only come in the form of bond sales, you\'d be very dramatically reducing the amount of credit available as a percentage of societal wealth, and that would dramatically retard growth.  When I wrote "natural conduit", I was specifically commenting on the free market element of commercial banking.  I\'d rather the credit creation happen by private banks responding to market signals then by the federal or state governments or a central bank.  \n\nFRB did indeed start because of the friction of moving gold, but that\'s not why it continues even long after gold became irrelevant.  It continues because credit is the lifeblood of our economy, and FRB seems to be one of the best ways to create it.  \n\nHere\'s another way of thinking about it.  We have a huge pile of wealth in the form of gold or USD or bitcoins.  You can choose between A. have it sit static in a vault.  Or B. have it loaned and invested in the creation of new companies, new factories, new scientific research etc.  The latter will produce much more economic growth that leads to higher quality of life, at the risk of the occasional 2008 credit crisis.

We could have certain keys which give that authority. The "federated" part refers to having various different independent actors whose keys are authorized by some central source. So basically there\'s some master key issuer and various different authorized signers. This is the same type of key management used for SSL certs.\n\nSo it would be somewhat similar to proof-of-stake in the sense that there\'s a low computational requirement, but different in that the authority comes from these keys rather than ownership of tokens.\n\nI hope that explanation helps. Let me know if it doesn\'t and I can try again. Basically: there are many possible ways of determining whose "chain" (shared database) is valid. Each of these have different incentive structures.

One bank claims that they accounted for $1 on the blockchain and issued a digital token for it, right?  Prove it!   How do we know that $1 still exists?  Banks hold gold reserves. Technically they could issue a gold token, but how do we know if the gold is redeemable?\n\nOnce a single USD or gold brick is on a blockchain, there is no guarantee or PROOF, without a complete audit, that it\'s redeemable.  So even if you tokenize USD, you still don\'t have a settlement free digital asset.  It\'s just an IOU and everything is based on trust again.\n\nBitcoin is a native digital asset, that allows you to send value instantly, with zero settlement and zero trust.  If you control the keys, then you own it.  And if someone wants you to prove it.  You sign a message with the private key, that you in fact control those bitcoins.     \n\nThe financial collapses would not have happened, if banks could prove their solvency by signing messages on their reserves.\n\nThis is the motherfucker.

I thought I\'d chime in and shed some light.\n\nWhat we\'re looking at here is the various regional indices and it\'s total volumes.\n\nSome background on how we collect data and why:\nSince we started the company we decided to \'track-everything\'.\nThe price on the website is what we call the \'Global-Weighted-Avarage\' or (GWA).\n\nIt is the weight price and volume sum of all our Regional Indices and is designed to be a global reference price.\n\nWe built this because we couldn\'t find any source that ensured us visibility across every single exchange, market & currency globally. (as you all know this industry has grown at lightning speed! - there\'s now over 100 bitcoin exchanges globally).\n\nThe GWA has served it\'s purpose as a general global snapshot and we are now changing two things:\n(all of our regional indexes and markets data will remain available on the site)\n\n1 - (immediate) We have expelled Houbi & OkCoinChina from both the CNY Markets & GWA calculations. However we continue to collect their live trading data as part of our mandate to track everything. \nThis industry is quickly maturing to the point where the currency and technology is about to explode globally and change the world forever. We must ignore market-participants who cannot contribute positively and transparently.\nIf these 2 exchanges can prove their volumes are 100% legit, we will re-address their inclusion. But for the time being - its gone too far.\n\n2) We will be replacing the Global-Weighted-Average price as displayed on our website, apps and API\'s with a new index. This will take a few days. We spent the last 6 months developing a purpose built index for professional and institutional use. ie - something you can comfortably trust as true reference to settle money against.\n\nHere is a snapshot of the new index. \nhttp://www.tradingview.com/x/d6GURBbi. \nIt\'s called the "Bitcoin-Liquid-Index" (BNC-BLX) and currently has 8 of the most trusted and liquid exchanges included out the 100+ out there. We will add an 9th, Gemini, once they reach our minimum liquidity requirements. \n\nThe methodology was developed by experts from large NY based Indexing companies with heavy deployment assistance from big-data and infrastructure specialist to meet enterprise needs. \n\nThe industry needs data to grow. That\'s our mission at BNC. \nIf a person or company wants to buy a futures contract or derivative product - they need to trust the operator that their settlements are calculated fairly. We will hash the BNC-BLX on the blockchain so 3rd parties... or you... can verify that exchanges offering financial product are actually using/calculating the way they say they are... \n\nBuying a financial product powered by a blockchain should be handled better than buying financial products on traditional stock-exchanges. Bitcoin represents technology that can usher in a new era of transparency and accountability. \nHoubi & OkCoinChina, do not meet the Liquid Index requirements either. \nThe BNC-BLX is available today as a full historic database for superior technical analysis and for various application: https://www.quandl.com/data/BNC1\nIt is also available today for Commercial/Enterprise use. It will be available for developers as a live feed through our API pages shortly (currently building this page!)\n\nFor anybody interested in early access or a spec sheet to this data-feed: please feel free to drop us a line on contact@bravenewcoin.com or subscribe to our newsletters through the site. \n\nI apologize to Houbi or OkCoinChina for any inconvenience this may cause and urge them to reach out to verify their trading volumes. \n\nI\'ll reply to any questions tomorrow (NZ timezone) \nThanks!\n\n\n': 2, '[In other words...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDrfE9I8_hs)': 8, "It's very impressive given it's market value c.25% in 24hours, wow": 2, 'Not bad.
