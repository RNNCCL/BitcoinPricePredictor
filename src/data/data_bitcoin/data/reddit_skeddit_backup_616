Coinbase said it has insurance, offering traders some assurance that their money won\xe2\x80\x99t disappear.\n\nBitcoin enthusiasts have been buffeted by the collapse of Japan-based exchange Mt. Gox last year\xe2\x80\x94taking with it around half a billion dollars of investors\xe2\x80\x99 money\xe2\x80\x94and a security breach earlier this month at Slovenia-based exchange Bitstamp. The value of a bitcoin itself, determined by trading on existing exchanges, has fallen to about $240, from a peak in late 2013 of more than $1,200.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo have an organized exchange that has the backing of thoughtful venture capitalists and investors addresses one of the main problems with bitcoin: its extreme volatility,\xe2\x80\x9d said Campbell R. Harvey, a Duke University finance professor who has studied cryptocurrencies. \xe2\x80\x9cBitcoin has been sorely in need of something like this.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nCoinbase\xe2\x80\x99s founders say they have been working for five months to win licenses from state financial regulators. They have regulatory approval in half of U.S. states, including large population centers like New York and California. For now, Coinbase can do business with account holders only in states where it has approval.\n\nCoinbase will take a small percentage\xe2\x80\x94likely less than 1%\xe2\x80\x94of most transactions, said Fred Ehrsam, 26 years old, a co-founder. The exchange will initially be limited to users in the U.S., but Chief Executive Brian Armstrong, 32, said he plans to expand overseas.\n\nMr. Armstrong said he expected to attract both individuals and businesses looking to trade bitcoin. \xe2\x80\x9cOur goal is to become the world\xe2\x80\x99s largest exchange,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\nOthers are looking to open U.S.-based bitcoin exchanges, including Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, the twin brothers known for their early feuds with Facebook Inc. founder Mark Zuckerberg .\n\nFinancial regulators, including the U.S. Federal Reserve, have been scrutinizing bitcoin recently. Benjamin Lawsky , the superintendent of the New York State Department of Financial Services, is working on a so-called BitLicense for firms looking to offer digital-currency services in the state; Coinbase is operating under earlier regulations. Mr. Lawsky\xe2\x80\x99s plan is seen as a template for legislation in other jurisdictions, and it may give outsiders more confidence in the currency.\n\nBitcoins are created using high-powered computers that \xe2\x80\x9cmine\xe2\x80\x9d for the currency by solving complex mathematical equations. They are exchanged digitally either for currency, or goods and services. Ownership and transactions are recorded, anonymously, in a so-called blockchain, which backers say reduces the risk of fraud.\n\nBitcoin grew to prominence in recent years in part because of the ease with which it can be transferred.\n\nCoindesk, which tracks the price of bitcoins, says 82,000 businesses accept the currency, double that of a year earlier, including e-commerce site Overstock.com Inc. and Expedia Inc., as well as many small retailers. The value of all bitcoin is $3.2 billion, according to Coindesk\xe2\x80\x99s price index.\n\nThe NYSE invested in Coinbase during a $75 million round of fundraising that closed this month. Other investors include USAA Bank, the venture arm of Spain\xe2\x80\x99s Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA, former Citigroup Inc. CEO Vikram Pandit and former Thomson Reuters Corp. CEO Tom Glocer. Venture backers include Draper Fisher Jurvetson, Andreessen Horowitz and Union Square Ventures.\n\nThe NYSE\xe2\x80\x99s investment was intended in part to \xe2\x80\x9ckeep an eye on bitcoin as it matures as a legitimate currency,\xe2\x80\x9d President Tom Farley said. \xe2\x80\x9cAny currency relies on its acceptance.\xe2\x80\x9d The Coinbase exchange \xe2\x80\x9cis an important step for the currency to become socially acceptable.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nCoinbase counts about 2.2 million consumer wallets and nearly 40,000 merchants that use its services. The company has about 75 employees and plans to operate in 30 countries by year-end, up from 19 today.': 205}, ('What if the saudis sold all their oil for BTC?', 0): {'[deleted]': 0, "Even if countries around the world had to purchase oil in BTC they certainly wouldn't buy from an exchange.

Coinbase said it has insurance, offering traders some assurance that their money won\xe2\x80\x99t disappear.\n\nBitcoin enthusiasts have been buffeted by the collapse of Japan-based exchange Mt. Gox last year\xe2\x80\x94taking with it around half a billion dollars of investors\xe2\x80\x99 money\xe2\x80\x94and a security breach earlier this month at Slovenia-based exchange Bitstamp. The value of a bitcoin itself, determined by trading on existing exchanges, has fallen to about $240, from a peak in late 2013 of more than $1,200.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo have an organized exchange that has the backing of thoughtful venture capitalists and investors addresses one of the main problems with bitcoin: its extreme volatility,\xe2\x80\x9d said Campbell R. Harvey, a Duke University finance professor who has studied cryptocurrencies. \xe2\x80\x9cBitcoin has been sorely in need of something like this.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nCoinbase\xe2\x80\x99s founders say they have been working for five months to win licenses from state financial regulators. They have regulatory approval in half of U.S. states, including large population centers like New York and California. For now, Coinbase can do business with account holders only in states where it has approval.\n\nCoinbase will take a small percentage\xe2\x80\x94likely less than 1%\xe2\x80\x94of most transactions, said Fred Ehrsam, 26 years old, a co-founder. The exchange will initially be limited to users in the U.S., but Chief Executive Brian Armstrong, 32, said he plans to expand overseas.\n\nMr. Armstrong said he expected to attract both individuals and businesses looking to trade bitcoin. \xe2\x80\x9cOur goal is to become the world\xe2\x80\x99s largest exchange,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\nOthers are looking to open U.S.-based bitcoin exchanges, including Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, the twin brothers known for their early feuds with Facebook Inc. founder Mark Zuckerberg .\n\nFinancial regulators, including the U.S. Federal Reserve, have been scrutinizing bitcoin recently. Benjamin Lawsky , the superintendent of the New York State Department of Financial Services, is working on a so-called BitLicense for firms looking to offer digital-currency services in the state; Coinbase is operating under earlier regulations. Mr. Lawsky\xe2\x80\x99s plan is seen as a template for legislation in other jurisdictions, and it may give outsiders more confidence in the currency.\n\nBitcoins are created using high-powered computers that \xe2\x80\x9cmine\xe2\x80\x9d for the currency by solving complex mathematical equations. They are exchanged digitally either for currency, or goods and services. Ownership and transactions are recorded, anonymously, in a so-called blockchain, which backers say reduces the risk of fraud.\n\nBitcoin grew to prominence in recent years in part because of the ease with which it can be transferred.\n\nCoindesk, which tracks the price of bitcoins, says 82,000 businesses accept the currency, double that of a year earlier, including e-commerce site Overstock.com Inc. and Expedia Inc., as well as many small retailers. The value of all bitcoin is $3.2 billion, according to Coindesk\xe2\x80\x99s price index.\n\nThe NYSE invested in Coinbase during a $75 million round of fundraising that closed this month. Other investors include USAA Bank, the venture arm of Spain\xe2\x80\x99s Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA, former Citigroup Inc. CEO Vikram Pandit and former Thomson Reuters Corp. CEO Tom Glocer. Venture backers include Draper Fisher Jurvetson, Andreessen Horowitz and Union Square Ventures.\n\nThe NYSE\xe2\x80\x99s investment was intended in part to \xe2\x80\x9ckeep an eye on bitcoin as it matures as a legitimate currency,\xe2\x80\x9d President Tom Farley said. \xe2\x80\x9cAny currency relies on its acceptance.\xe2\x80\x9d The Coinbase exchange \xe2\x80\x9cis an important step for the currency to become socially acceptable.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nCoinbase counts about 2.2 million consumer wallets and nearly 40,000 merchants that use its services.

If the demand is higher than the supply, then transaction fees will go up.\n\nCurrently average fees is about 0.0001 BTC for an average of 259 byte transactions...

Then it will probably come back up.\n\nRight now with the current MIN_RELAY_TX_FEE of 0.00001 BTC and MIN_TX_FEE of 0.0001 BTC mempools of the biggest mining pools are pretty full, so it stands to say that if you lowered fees to 1 satoshi, confirmation times would be like an average of 7-10 blocks to confirm your transaction once (as they can\'t fit them all in one block)\n\nBasically, you have put 0 thought into it and just assume that the people who think about it day and night are stupid for no reason except that "I think transactions should be free because lol"\n\nIf you truly think 1 satoshi fees are feasible, write up a research paper using arguments based in economic theory and tests you\'ve done using testnet etc. to try and support your thesis.

If mining is very expensive, then miners in general will require a higher fee to support their endeavors. If the value of bitcoin is very high, then the fee required to make mining profitable decreases.\n\nEconomically, the optimal fee would be one that encourages a sufficient level of mining. Without miners, transactions wouldn't get confirmed at all. If there aren't enough miners, then that provides other issues.\n\nYou also have to factor that reward from solving a new block also encourages mining, which is likely the main incentive for mining at the current moment.

But that's not the whole story, unfortunately.\n\nFirst of all, Fed's easy credit after the bursting of the NASDAQ bubble was the reason for the '08 crisis. The availability of cheap credit made it possible to create all these bizarre financial instruments that were basically relying on the housing prices always going up (which they did while the bubble lasted). So, if it weren't for the Fed, we wouldn't have had the '08 crisis.\n\nSecond, it is arguable whether Fed's constant meddling (even with best intentions in mind) doesn't do more harm than good. Absent a nanny meddling entity, financial crises would be much less frequent, deeper and shorter - as they were before the Fed was created. Basically, the market would quickly purge itself from the bad businesses.

A government (corporation-state) must be able to identify you to extract resources from you.  If it cannot then you are in terms of your finances a free-er person and more able to help your community, and corporations - and corporation-states - ultimately cannot extract as much of the users as they previouisly could.

This hinges on whether or not you wish to be a slave to Coinbase, BitPay, their service, their terms, and their approach to identity... as their approach to identity requires you conform and bow down before the corporation-state. \n\n This gets to the issue of whether or not we want to be able to craft a society free of what has bound us in the past.  We have the possibility of casting off the chains that in the past have caused us for generations to be so prone to having our tax dollars years after year for generations sent to feudal lords of war who commit genocide and engage in massive slavery using our resources.  That is called taxation, not only without our consent, but without our input as to where the money should end up after having been collected.  Layers of consent, or in this case, lack thereof in our society, lead to layers of a surplus of violence which in turn lead to an abundance of anger which is turned into a circle of hatred, which we have the power to break, first by raising our awareness, but also by removing resources from those who wish to centralize such resources in the hands of a few who would then continue to use them without regard or interest to what the rest of humanity is concerned with. \n\nThe notion of a "50 state solution," which a conference of bankers is preparing to unleash upon is in final form in mid-February (although they have no legal basis to impose it) right in the middle of a Bitcoin Foundation election, is at the very least a little bit suspicious, and BitPay has just in the past few days been seen running with its lobbyists and friends to none other than the US Treasury (of course to ensure its interests are protected).

BitFinex, BitStamp, OKCoin, etc. are exchanges, which means that they are more focussed on people who want to speculate and daytrade. I would not advise doing that unless you have daytraded elsewhere, and maybe even not then, since the BTC market seems to be manipulated and, um, devoid of the "fundamentals" that traders are interested in. \n\nThe big news now is that Coinbase will announce tomorrow that it will also be an exchange, and (first time ever) a US-based regulated exchange. I would wait to see how this shakes out. \n\nOnce you buy BTC, and if you\'re not interested in daytrading, it would be a good idea to move your btc out of web-based wallets. The reason for this is that if you keep your btc there, someone else controls your money, and if they go bankrupt, decide there\'s some problem with your account, etc., you\'re screwed.
