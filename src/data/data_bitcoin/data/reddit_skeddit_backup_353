But accomodating more users and all their garbage transactions requires increasing the block size. The effect of an increase to 8 MB will not be immediate; it will only allow the traffic to creep up from the current ~120\'000 tx/day to ~3 million tx/day, instead hiting a limit at ~360\'000 tx/day. The nodes will continue to become more expensive to run, as they are now, but the cost will continue to rise slowly without limit instead of stopping when it is 3x as expensive as today.\n\n>The Blockstream guys, on the other hand, have decided that traffic on the bitcoin network cannot be allowed to grow much further. So they have decided that the current and future "normal" users of bitcoin should be forced to relocate to some rubegoldbergian "overlay network" that, by coincidence, will be using software components to be developed by Blockstream. Their plan to achive this goalis to keep the blocks at 1 MB and hope that, when the network staurates, the fees will rise until the "plebs" will no longer be able to afford them. One of their devs expects that the fees will end up being 3--6 BTC/block, which at current prices is 0.30-0.60 USD/tx. The bitcoin network then will be reserved to a small and non-growing set of elite users, including the hubs of the overlay network.\n\n>**It is ironic that Blockstream accuses Gavin and Mike of "dictatorial", since I have not seen any discussion of their own Master Plan for evicting the current bitcoin users and pushing them to the overlay network.** I also doubt very much that they understand what they are doing. They don\'t seem aware of chaos that the "fee market" will be, whether for plebs or for the gents of means. After claiming for months that sidechains (which they have never been able to explain adequately) would solve the scalability problem, they have now admitted that they won\'t.

You lose out on the gigantic amount of processing power which is out there securing the existing blockchain\n\nThe problem with that theory is, that it is an arms race with yourselves, the more you work to secure the system the harder it is to do it.\nThis "brute force" security is an ineffective model, and it means that there are groups that have huge processing power, so it is actually quite easy to achieve a very high percentage of the total hash power "on tap" if other big players have a problem.\n\nHaving security by having a huge arsenal of weapons is a dangerous.\n\nSo you\'ve got to hire technical wizards to secure this thing, but the problem is, the best people in the world are already working on bitcoin, and they aren\'t going to come work for you.\n\nThat is an unsupported assumption, I would say the number of computer, crypto and IT experts working just for the NSA would outnumber the number of experts in Bitcoin by probably 1000 to 1 or more.

Will never ever ever ever happen. Ever.\n\n2) One of the biggest possibilities of Bitcoin beyond just a peer to peer currency is a token system to run a totally decentralized stock market. The biggest potential here is a truly singular international stock market. Now, will all the disparate countries of the world trust a blockchain(s) controlled by private companies centered in a handful of nations around the world? Fuck no.

Governments, the ultimate arbiters today of how global trade works, will not support as a whole a system that centralizes new economic networks in the hands of a few when there is the alternative available to distribute that and decentralize to a lot higher order.

Fractional reserve is only possible off-chain. \n\nI\'m not saying that bitcoin enforces an equitable distribution, or that it\'s desirable for everyone to have the same amount of wealth; I\'m just saying that with gold as currency, an equitable distribution is *impossible*, thus encouraging a wide wealth gap, whereas with bitcoin it\'s at least possible to have a fair distribution with a good store of value and medium of exchange.

So if we somehow found ourselves in a world where we were back on the gold standard, and the value of gold shot up to the moon, it wouldn\'t matter if the average person had 24 grams or 240 grams or 2,400 grams... scarcity is what gives it value and on paper you could be transacting in fractions of a gram, just like satoshis are fractions of a bitcoin.\n\nAlso, wealth is not distributed equally, and this is nothing to cry about either. The reason gold or bitcoin, or dollars have value is that there is a wealth inequality. If everyone had an equal amount of "tokens" the economy would not work.\n\nBy the way, how exactly does Bitcoin preserve equitable distribution?

However, that was resolved in under 24 hours since there were no proponents insisting on the switch to the altcoin, and losses were minimal.

But for the record, here it is again. (edited to use *supermajority* rather than consensus)\n\n--------- cut and paste ---------\n\nEveryone seems to miss the affect of the 'difficulty' on mining at the point of a hard fork.\n\nAssume your pool has 25% of the hashpower and the XT **supermajority** is triggered.  They stay mining small blocks and rejecting XT blocks - the chain forks.\n\nNow your pool is mining with a difficulty level set to achieve 10 minute blocks with 100% of the hashpower. But there is only 25% of the hashpower working on this chain... blocks on this chain now average every 40 minutes ... and the re-targeting of difficulty (downwards) will take many weeks.  So suddenly, your pool and any normal users following the small block chain, have a seriously degraded performance in what they see as Bitcoin.\n\nThe XT block chain has a similar issue, but with far less degradation - average block time for them drifts to about 13.3 minutes ... and the re-targeting of the difficulty number is much faster (because block production is faster). As a bonus, this chain no longer has any transaction congestion in their blocks.\n\nAs confusion rears its head in the consumer and services operations, people will rapidly find out that they can remove the problems they have with their Bitcoin performance, by simply following the XT majority of miners.\n\nAnd that is what people will do - move en mass to the XT block chain.\n\nYour pool remains free to mine with the old rules, but the coins they mine are not valid at any exchange or user that is following the XT block chain ... and that will very rapidly make them worthless. I am sure you can guess what the your pool will do under those circumstances - upgrade their software.\n\nAnd for anyone who is not a miner, but wants to have zero impact on their business, it makes a huge amount of sense to switch to the XT (0.11) code base as soon as Mike Hearn releases it.\n\nWhy?  \n\n* If the supermajority is NOT reached, you are unaffected.\n* If the supermajority IS reached, you are unaffected.\n\nSwitching to XT  (0.11) is a zero risk choice.... staying with Bitcoin core means *risking disruption* if a supermajority IS reached.\n\n-------- end cut and paste ----------------\n\nSo explain to me, either where I made any error in the above description, or how that scenario gives the 25% miners a commercial advantage?": 1, 'You have to think in terms off the blockchain that each peer will see; because there are two blockchains, they can become out of sync, and the lack of synchronization can be used to make double spends and a great deal of confusion.\n\nIn essence, Bitcoin XT is an altcoin that is being bootstrapped on Bitcoin&nbsp;Core\'s blockchain; Bitcoin&nbsp;XT is *copying* the state of Bitcoin&nbsp;Core users\' holdings, and then just hoping people switch to using Bitcoin&nbsp;XT instead.\n\n-------\n\nThat is, a hard fork is the same thing as creating an altcoin and then just telling everybody to switch to it.\n\nBitcoin will never be on a firm foundation as long as there is the possibility of a hard&nbsp;fork; the only right thing to do is to let each system stand on its own (Bitcoin&nbsp;Core, Bitcoin&nbsp;XT, etc.), but create explicit paths between them with what\'s called a 2-way peg, so that users can transfer their coins from one system to the other.\n\nThis would be achieved by making Bitcoin&nbsp;XT a sidechain of Bitcoin&nbsp;Core; in that case, Bitcoin&nbsp;XT would *still* be an altcoin, but it would start with a brand new blockchain that is coupled to Bitcoin&nbsp;Core\'s blockchain, and only Bitcoin&nbsp;Core would be allowed to create new coins.\n\nAs time goes by, if Bitcoin&nbsp;XT becomes the de&nbsp;facto "Bitcoin", it would be possible to pinch off Bitcoin&nbsp;XT, copy over the rest of Bitcoin&nbsp;Core\'s blockchain, and then have Bitcoin&nbsp;XT continue the minting process; even if this requires a hard fork, it would be much more trivial.': 1}, ('Feeling a bit social?

Apparantly it is technically possible to encode multiple sends in a single TX, but then you just get a bunch of really big transactions that cost way more in fees, instead of a bunch of normal size transactions paying smaller fees. Doesn't make a whole lot of difference either way TBH, other than the current method is easier and already implemented.  \n\nIt's actually not even that bad. The fees are not a concern for us and neither is the confirmation time (doesn't matter if it takes a whole day just to confirm, as long as it does eventually). The alternative would be to have a centralized web wallet where everybody just gets their coins/tokens instantly and can withdraw manually (but I think we all know how most of those turn out....). But yeah, if we are sending for example 1,500 transactions per week right now to 1,500 different users... if in a centralized web wallet system each of those users made an average of 1 withdrawal a week, then that equals out to the same amount of transactions being created anyways. The fees paid to push out all those transactions can be considered the cost of not needing to be responsible for user funds and not needing to maintain a float in a hot wallet. Well worth it for some use cases like ours IMO.\n\nEven though I am a Counterparty guy, I will say that one advantage that Colored Coins, Coin Spark etc. have is that they are UTXO based, meaning that they function much more closely to regular bitcoin. e.g you can do things like send multiple types of tokens to multiple people in a single sendmany type transaction.

I am leaning towards increasing the block size as opposed to the sidechains suggestion for a few reasons so far (however I also recognize that might not be a final solution either). On a philosophical level, the purpose of the Bitcoin\xe2\x80\x99s (or any coin\xe2\x80\x99s) developers is to produce a foundation in order for others to build on for third party applications (perfect example, smart contracts). Having a company propose a solution to a fundamental problem and implement it scares me. What would happen if they fold up? Who would then be responsible to fix the problem? Will the code be open source for others to help pick it up? And for that matter, will the code be open source at all so we can have multiple eyes on it to ensure that 4 billion+ dollars are safe?\n\nIn addition, and this is by no means a knock to Blockstream at all, they have received $20 million in order to work on this (which companies do, they need funding).
