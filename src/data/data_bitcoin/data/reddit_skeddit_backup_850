It's not like it suddenly opens up a market of people who aren't already into online commerce. \n\nWhen other companies are out there showing that bitcoin is starting to take a high share of total transactions, maybe Amazon would start to see that as a sign of demand for it, but why would they bother until then?

For example, people don\'t spend as much when recession occurs due to uncertainty of the future. As a result businesses are left with goods and services they can\'t sell. So what do they do? They lay people off. As a result, overall consumption in an economy slows down (people don\'t work, they don\'t get paid). Businesses respond by cutting costs (most notably, wages) so they can afford to cut prices (<-- deflation). Sounds good for consumers right? But imagine your the business again, you bought those goods and/or services using a loan or investor money and by cutting prices you made your loan more expensive (you are selling the goods/services for less than what you borrowed for)  and decreased your investors return on investment (or ROI). This is OK in the short-run (1 year? less than 5?), but this environment cannot persist or else you will enter what is called a deflationary spiral (Google: "Japan\'s Lost Decade" for an example).\n\nI\'ve already made this too long, but go re-read the Krugman article you posted above, it may make more sense now.': 2, "So it sounds to me like we lose this massive advantage with Bitcoin.

Saving it for later allows prices now to drop so that investment is cheaper and also signals that you will be able to gain money from people who will spend later.

Oh noes, people won't get into debt slavery.  How horrible (for the bankers).\n\n3)  On an adopted currency, the only way value does down with a fixed asset is if productivity increases or population increases.  If productivity increases, wages should keep up with that productivity gains.  Someone who gains productivity at average rates will not see their wages drop.  Someone who gains productivity at an above average rate will still see gains.  Someone who gains productivity increase at a below average rate will see their nominal wages drop, although it will still allow more purchasing power than before.\n\nBasically, deflationary currencies are bad news for bankers and big debtors (governments).  No wonder why their shills argue so vehemently against it.  The key argument they love to throw is that deflation is associated with bad economic times.  This is true in inflationary debt-based economies because you end up with business cycles of boom and bust, where booms happen where people think they are investing in productive assets due to the ease of acquiring money (aka inflation), but all of the calculations people make are incorrect since their costs increase having to compete with everyone else making correct decisions on the individual level.

": 1, "* Keynesians don't use a consistent, or correct, definition of deflation.  \n* Bitcoin doesn't deflate, and won't deflate for another hundred years;  it inflates at a rate of over 10%.  \n* Deflation in Bitcoin is not equivalent to deflation in centralized, debt-based currencies.": 6, "No, I don't disagree with him and I believe it would be a serious problem for any economy with a fixed supply. People love to focus on banks and governments as large debtors, but the more important factor with regards to the economy is how companies rely on debt. \n\nIf taking on debt becomes increasingly expensive and hoarding money increasingly profitable, companies as a whole would have an increasingly difficult time merely existing, never mind starting up or expanding, resulting in increased unemployment which feeds back into a decrease in spending which again influences corporate performance - you end up having what is basically a deflationary spiral. \n\nYou don't want either an economy going out of control or going depressed, you want it to be neither highly inflationary nor deflationary. Floating exchange rates as well as an adjustable money supply are both incredibly powerful tools to control national economies. Such tools are invaluable and they aren't inherently bad or good. It's whether they are properly used. But even though I have my reservations about whether people as a whole are capable of doing so, especially in democracies where curbing exuberant growth is generally an incredibly unpopular political talking point, I'd rather have us try, perhaps fail, learn, try again, perhaps fail again, hopefully learn more, than to pessimistically do away with them out of fear of failure.": 1, "Bitcoin is more divisible than gold. There won't be a liquidity trap the same way because eventually at some price you can (probably) find a buyer for whatever goods and services you have.\n\nLike say we were in a bitcoin world, and front page of /r/bitcoin has some land in Texas prominently for sale, about 1000 acres for about 32 thousand bitcoin. Well ... okay, there are people out there with 10,000+ bitcoin ... I personally think that they should divide that down into lots that people that have bitcoins could actually buy... like 10 acre plots for 320 bitcoin or so. But the problem is the divisibility of the land for sale, not the divisibility of the bitcoins.\n": 2, "Mr. Krugman also believes burger flippers should be entitled to a 15$ minimum wage rate and that this will magically be absorbed by businesses. He also thinks that this will not cause layoffs due to increased automation. Apparently, Mr Krugman had never run a burger flipping business, or any other business at all for that matter, because if he did he would be out of said business. \nThis man is a mouthpiece for the liberal keynesian central banking utopianists who feel that this constant boom bust cycle that awards the top 1% with easy money to do massive stock buybacks and ridiculous investments CYNK/whats app/ad nauseam, while leaving the little guy with less purchasing power for the goods in his shopping cart. \nNo one will ever be able to convince these people that magically redistributing $15 per hour for wages from the business owners' bottom line to the career burger flipper will not do anything but make the business bleed jobs and work hours. \nOnce i heard Krugman speak on this i really stopped giving his viewpoints any value. ": 2, 'Okay, I\'m not going to answer your other questions without answering the first one, because the crux of the matter is the definition of deflation.\n\nDeflation is simply, and only, a reduction in supply of a currency relative to everything else.  No other definition is even self-consistent.  And I\'ll explain why.\n\nKeynesians like to argue that deflation/inflation is a change in the *overall prices* of things that a currency can be used to purchase.  That\'s actually true, it is.  But that *only* comes about because of a change in the supply of that currency relative to everything else.  And here\'s why.\n\nA currency, if it can be used to buy even one thing at all, can be used to buy *anything*, just indirectly.  So there is always a price, denominated in that currency, for *anything*.  It may be rather high, depending.  But it exists.\n\nOnce you accept that assertion, then you accept that there is nothing really *outside* the economy of any particular currency.  There isn\'t really any such *thing* as "adoption".  There is only a change in price of a particular currency in relation to some particular good or service (or in this case competing currency) that it can be used to purchase.\n\nSo, when you say "if users adopt" Bitcoin over, say, US dollars, that doesn\'t really change anything about the overall equation.  There are still the same number of Bitcoins as before, and the same amount of everything else.  All that changes is the price, in Bitcoins, of that one particular thing that Bitcoins can be used to buy, *relative* to the price of everything else.  And when the price of dollars, denominated in Bitcoins, goes down (when users "adopt" Bitcoin), the price of everything else Bitcoins can be used to purchase (everything) **goes up by the same amount, by definition**, because those Bitcoins, at that moment, are not available to be used to buy anything else.\n\nAnd that\'s all there is to it.  The Keynesian definition of deflation/inflation, when placed in a consistent framework, reduces to the classical definition of deflation/inflation -- a change in the supply of the currency relative to everything it can be used to purchase.\n\nSo, in practice, in order to maintain the (inconsistent) Keynesian definition of deflation/inflation, something must be excluded.  As a Keynesian, you can\'t say "this currency can be used to buy anything," even though that may be the case.  You have to say "this currency can be used to buy anything, **but** credit derivatives," or "**but** energy," or "**but** food," or "**but** real estate."\n\nAs it turns out, that\'s exactly what Keynesians do.  They say "well, the definition of inflation includes everything **but** food and energy," or "our inflationary monetary policy works in an economy with everything **but** real estate bubbles," or "banks should be able to spend newly-printed money on anything **but** credit derivatives."  Keynesianism only works, in real life, when paired with an ever-evolving set of "gotchas."\n\nIt\'s not realistic.  And it\'s not realistic for a specific reason:  the Keynesian definition of inflation/deflation is not self-consistent.': 4, 'Krugman is a joke.': 1, "This community will answer this question, I just want to remind you that Krugman said the internet was a fad that would be no more impactful than fax machines.  He's type of economics and market commenter that, if you always do the opposite of what he says, you'll likely come out ahead; a contrarian indicator.  ": 2, '>when people expect falling prices, they become less willing to spend, and in particular less willing to borrow\n\nNeither spending nor saving is fundamentally "good" or "bad." The most efficient balance between saving and spending will depend on many factors, but the answer is not always "more spending is better" as Krugman seems to imply.\n\nIt\'s true that inflation will push people to spend more and save less, but whether or not higher current consumption (at the expense of future consumption) is the best option at a given time is up for debate. I believe consumers should be free to find their own desired balance between spending and saving without manipulation from those who control the money supply.\n\n>falling prices increase the real burden of their debts\n\nInterest rates account for expected inflation, so consistent inflation OR deflation will result in a stable debt burden. Volatility in either inflation OR deflation will cause volatility in the real value of debt. Stable deflation is no worse or better than stable inflation in this regard.\n\nKrugman\'s concern on this point is also tied to a desire for more spending and less saving, which is not necessarily preferable.\n\n>It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to cut nominal wages\n\nThis point is valid. IF some workers are unwilling to accept an efficient real wage because it is lower in nominal terms, those workers will be out of work. Fortunately, the bias for stable or rising nominal wages may be small in an economy with constant deflation.': 7}, ('Bitcoin Is Growing Up: Now You Can Hedge Your Investments', 202): {'[deleted]': 3, 'Is this similar to the "Locks" service that Erik Voorhees\' company Coinapult offers?': 1, 'Wow, thanks for that excellent explanation.

C\'mon. This is ridiculous. I can\'t rely on such tools anymore. It is 21st century, damit.

So the question is: Do we have more trust that we will be able to exchange dollars for food int the future, or to achange bitcoins for food? The dollar has as pro that it is well established, but then again, it has quite some history of government and banks fucking around, like printing more and thus lowering the value of what you have. Also, banks can freeze your acounts etc. Bitcoin has as pro: its way more easy to send and divide, and the underlying rules are public, so you can _understand_ how it works and whats possible, instead of having to trust your banks and government and credit card companies etc that they get it right and dont betray you. With bitcoins, there is no way to just decide to print more and cause inflation, or to freeze peoples accounts or stuff like that. What makes bitcoin better than sands, rocks, and orange juice: you can send bitcoins worldwid, fast. You can make backups to guard the access to your funds. You can divide them better.

For $20 you can purchase 5 million Satoshi. And for $4 you can purchase 1 million Satoshi:\n\n$400 = 100,000,000\n\n$4 = 1,000,000\n\nAwesome, isn't it?\n\nWhy so much Satoshi?

You pretty much explained it yourself in your post, yeah, anything could be used as a currency. But you can't send anything over a global, secure, decetnralised network.

The problem is that a centralized system that can out compete others in a market will almost always be more efficient unfortunately. People really want to be able to buy things with Bitcoin but it really doesn't make sense to buy Bitcoin and pay a 1-8% spread when you can get ~4% cash back and fraud protection using your credit card. \n\nI guess the hope for us at this point is that people in the world who don't have credit cards might start to use Bitcoin.

Value doesn\'t exist without a valuer, and every valuer is going to hold different values.': 2, ">  there is no implicit or underlying value tied to either a currency or a precious metal like Gold.\n\nThis is also true of everything else in the world (and out of this world).  Things only have the value that people assign to them, and that value is measured in what people are willing to give up in exchange for the thing they want.  Each person can have a different value for a given item, and the same person can have different values at different times.\n\nThe idea that things have inherent underlying values is a mirage.  Widely traded commodities have relatively stable exchange rates/market prices because lots of people exhibit their personal values. An average results when the people who want it more and the people who want something else more reach agreement and execute trades.\n\nWhat increases personal valuations is the usefulness or desirability of an item.  Automobiles are very useful in the US, so most everyone is willing to give up other things in order to get one, establishing a market price.  Luxury cars are only marginally more useful than economy ones.  They are however much more desirable as a status symbol.\n\nThe usefulness of the Bitcoin Network is in the ability to move value quickly and with low fees from place to place.  The bitcoin unit is needed to use the Network, so it derives value from it.  The unit also is desirable as a scarce good that can store value over time.

The union just wants to ensure its employees are fairly compensated - that is last year\'s salary + inflation adjustment of 2%/year going forward.  At the strike rally, one employee asks another... You know I\'ve been thinking, why does everything go up in price 2% every year anyway? Computers are more efficient, cars are more efficient, food production is more efficient, house building is more efficient, we all work more efficiently with all our continuing increasing efficient tools, yet somehow the cost of living goes up not down. Why is that? The other employee shrugs, but at the same time a 3rd employee overhearing blurts out: It\'s because of money printing. And it\'s not just 2%... it\'s really more like 4-6%, they just twist the calculations and definitions of inflation so it doesn\'t sound so bad. Overall, they just keep printing more money every year, by the Trillions! It\'s basically counterfeiting because it decreases the value of our existing dollars, but this is the way the system is designed. Look, we can\'t even get an automatic 2% inflation increase in our wages to stay on par, we have to actually fight for it, which is ridiculous. It\'s impossible to get ahead. Just look at history, only our fathers used to work and they all had 3-5 children, now two parents work and can barely afford 1 or 2 kids. 2% inflation every year is a compounding problem that is now making our entire middle class poor. So what\'s the solution (asks one of the other 2 employees). We need to change the system from the ground up. Instead of an inflationary system, we need a deflationary system. You know, when a dollar earned and saved is still worth a dollar or more in buying power next year.  Then cut to cartoon logo: "BITCOIN - we can help with that". Bitcoin is the worlds most successful deflationary currency, helping people store and increase their wealth for 5 years running.

Imagine this scenario: Two years ago, you bought what you believed to be the world\'s first consumer car that would be completely autonomous and able to navigate a future infrastructure of automatic roads. Let\'s call it the Moon. The Moon could communicate with other Moons, and work with a road network to drive you automatically, at super-high speeds and on solar power, wherever you wanted to go. The only catch is, the Moon doesn\'t have a steering wheel. You bought it relying on future infrastructure that didn\'t yet exist in mass scale. Let\'s say that this car doesn\'t follow typical economic rules, and you bought it for $5,000, believing that it would one day be worth six figures. What a steal! You bought in right when it was getting some publicity (hell, it was only $3,000 a week ago!) and it seemed that the road network would be rolled out en masse within the next few years.\n\nWell, over the next few years, the Moon\'s infrastructure didn\'t come en masse. It\'s there, for sure, but it can only drive you from your home to that weird foreign market in the other side of the city, and despite its potential, it\'s losing value. It\'s an exceptionally innovative car, to be sure--it could be huge, if only people realized!--but, for various reasons, is yet unpopular. It\'s seen by the public as something in the domain of the tech-savvy, the thrill-seeking teenagers, and the criminals looking to make a quick getaway after a failed robbery. This isn\'t helped by the fact that the auto industry has been silently "persuading" members of congress to stonewall any regulation to roll out the Moon\'s infrastructure, under the guise of protecting the rest of the drivers on the road. It doesn\'t matter that it costs practically nothing to run. It doesn\'t matter that the Moon is everything that the sci-fi writers of the 50s dreamed of when they envisioned future transportation. The infrastructure isn\'t there, the public is wholly apathetic about it, and the Moon sits in your garage, deprecating, and occasionally driving you to that weird foreign market just to keep the engine in good shape.\n\nNow, you spent $5,000 on this automotive wonder. You even spent a couple hundred more on the exterior to make it beautiful. Your Moon is your baby. But it\'s lost $4,000 of value since you bought it. True, the public could snap and realize that the Moon really is the greatest thing to hit the streets since the Model T--it really is only one PR campaign away--but the company that makes the Moon is tiny, and its userbase is relatively powerless.\n\nNow, in your situation, what do you do? Do you hock it and at least save $1,000 of your initial purchase?
