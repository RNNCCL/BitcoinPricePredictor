We are happily surprised by the attention this is getting from the /r/bitcoin community, thanks to everyone for the great feedback. As you can probably tell by our incomplete website, we\'re not 100% ready for prime-time, but we\'re working overtime to get everything up-to-date.\n\nTo answer some of the common questions:\n\n**1. Do you accept bitcoin?**\nYes! There are links on the product page to BitPay checkouts for both U.S. and International orders. We are currently working on a more seamless integration into the checkout system, it\'s just taking longer than expected.\n\n**2. Who is this for?**\nRight now, this is great for people who either develop bitcoin applications and want to have access to their own full node, or people who just want to support the network.\n\n**3. Do you have instructions?**\nWhile the unit is "plug and play," meaning that if you plug it into a power outlet and your router, it should work automatically, we are also including instructions with each unit that cover some edge cases that might cause people issues. Also included will be instructions for getting the device to work with the [Bitnodes Incentive Program](https://getaddr.bitnodes.io/nodes/incentive/) (though we do not have the manpower to provide support for every edge case there, as that program does add some complexity).\n\n**4. Can I build from source? How do I update?**\nThis box is just a generic Linux server with some custom scripts to automate the provisioning of bitcoind. You are welcome to uninstall what\'s on it and install whatever you want, at your own risk of course. As far as updating goes, the plan is to build a new bitcoind binary for major updates. Users will just replace the old bitcoind & run the new binary. We\'re open to suggestions for how this can be improved.\n\n**5. What about people who are scared of the command line? Anything for the muggles?**\nI am one of those people, and while this unit is very straightforward to use on the command-line, we also understand that a nice GUI goes a long way. We\'re going to be doing a crowdfunding campaign for the next-gen version of the box that will have a more attractive case as well as a Web UI for local or remote administration.

Somewhere between that testing and the publishing of the update to the Chrome store a development version of the extension with critical functionality disabled replaced the tested and approved version of the update, likely due to a build being pulled from the wrong branch of our repository.

You can pay for it by just scanning his QR code from anywhere so long as you have the connection. You can tip people on reddit for 5 cents just for giving a laugh if you don\'t want to give them gold instantly versus them having to give out a Paypal email. Also, bitcoin is a great alternative to Paypal just because of speed, costs as well as the fact that Paypal can just terminate services with you and basically run off with your money. Just because it has no application to YOU specifically, it\'s not useful. Also, for Brazil, it\'s not as widespread as there isn\'t many options/exchanges that have opened, but in other places in the world, it\'s gaining traction (ie: Philippines). Considering that credit cards, paypal and other traditional methods do not work, sometimes Western Union is your only option. Western Union costs like $5 transfer fees to send $200 for just a local transaction. Bitcoin does ANY AMOUNT for pennies and there isn\'t as big a spread on currency exchange (2.5%). Take a look at how much rebit saves compared to sending via WU. The remittance market is huge and is billions in just money. Western Union made 5.5 TRILLION in revenues in 2013. Imagine if instead of charging $5 on a $200 transaction (this is a local only transaction. It costs much more if you send internationally by about 3% more) it was only 5 cents (1% of $5). So, imagine if that 99% went back to the people, much better and much more convenient.\n         \n2) You\'re asking more of the value of money and what gives money value. Would you accept gold then? In short, you don\'t have to. If you don\'t like it, then don\'t accept it. But keep in mind that it\'s not chargebackable, it means you make more. Merchants accepting credit cards and the like also face the risk of chargebacks, sometimes months after the fact. They also have to pay a 2.5% percentage of their sales revenue to the credit card company. Bitcoin companies like BitPay or Coinbase charges ~1% to instantly convert to FIAT or 0% (if you do it yourself). \n\n3) You should just go live in a forest and be a hermit for the rest of your life if you actually want to kill yourself.

The technology is scalable and many different coins are being released. Bitcoin is as well, but slower due to the immense size and the possible effects. I suggest you watch a couple videos of Andreas Antonopolous presenting bitcoin.\n      \n5) That\'s fine. At it\'s current state, governments have an extreme amount of capital controls. Read up on civil asset forfeiture. Banks can shut down your accounts for any reason at all.

Bitcoin is infinitly divisible and can react as adoption increases, but how is having another form of money which remains in the hands of a few going to change things? Every medium of bartering will inevitably have those who hold more of what's being traded. An elected governments protect the sovereignty of what they own by printing more and struggling to maintain inflation, Bitcoin does is by creating smaller denominations of worth as price increases.\n\n3. We already do. But hopefully those heavily involved in Bitcoin are a little more open minded than the oil consortiums, war mongerers, monarchs and the like which run the world now.\n\n4. Once the rewards become too low the creation of new coins will likely be centralised to large mining locations anyway.

They find measurable physical characteristics that are unique to each integrated circuit. Among them, device identification using initial power-up values of SRAM cells, called SRAM fingerprints, has been emphasized lately in part due to the abundant availability of SRAM cells in modern microprocessors. More importantly, since the cross-coupled inverter structure of each SRAM cell amplifies even the small mismatches between two inverter nodes, it is thus very sensitive to and maximizes the effect of random process variation, making SRAM fingerprints to acquire great features as a naturally inherent device ID.

Each bit has its own tendency towards 0 or 1.  A lot are almost always stuck at 0 or 1.  Some are in the middle and can equally likely be 0 or 1 on power-up.  Others have some preference for 0 or 1, e.g. they end up at 1 twice as often as at 0.\n\nThe skew of each bit is due to random manufacturing fluctuations, as explained above.  The closer it is to the middle, the more entropy this bit has.  In every device this pattern is different, and that's the basis for fingerprinting.\n\nFingerprinting itself is not important for Mycelium Entropy.  What's important is that on average 21 bits of SRAM produce 1 bit of entropy on every power-up.  With the amount of SRAM on the device that gives several thousand bits of entropy.\n\nThis raw entropy is quite sparse and spread throughout the entire SRAM.  So a cryptographic hash function extracts the entropy to make a 512 bit true random number, where each bit is fully random.

One elegant characteristic of Bitcoin is that the hashing work done by miners directly relates to the security of Bitcoin, which in turn is directly related to the value of the network as characterized by the price of bitcoin. If people find the network useful and the value of bitcoin goes up, so does the mining incentive, causing more miners to mine and increasing the network's overall security. If the network is less used, the value of a bitcoin goes down, bringing the mining incentive with it and overall security is reduced. This is fine, though, because there is less value in the network to secure in this scenario. The self-adjusting difficulty ensures that mining will always be economically profitable for some segment of the population, regardless of the price of bitcoin.  \n\nSo the work expended by miners is largely irrelevant to users who choose not to mine.
