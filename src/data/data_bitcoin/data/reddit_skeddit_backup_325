And yet very few people did it.  In fact, when people did many others in "the community"-- on the forums, on chat-- went out of their way to insult them for being so stupid to CPU mine because it earns "nothing".\n\nI argued in favor of it-- that it avoided the trouble of dealing with exchanges to buy Bitcoin,  that mining supported the diversity of the network, and that it was really no problem, just something that ran in the background-- even if the amounts were small, hey they could be used to pay transaction fees if nothing else.  People insulted me for this too, though they usually stopped when I walked very carefully through the power calculations. The real cognitive error is that people regard sufficiently small amounts of income as zero, as an insult even, and they didn\'t care about the reduction in difficulty buying bitcoin (esp as it didn\'t save them from the purchases entirely).\n\n[And FWIW, I continued to CPU mine, alongside my GPUs, until my calculations said it was a loss-- doubly prudent considering much of the time GPUs were just unavailable to buy, they were sold out everywhere!]\n\nWe were actually badgered by users in Bitcoin core to hide the mining support, because people would turn it on and then be seriously angry about what they (didn\'t) received.\n\nSo as much as the argument is near to my heart,  we\'ve been there before and were unable to sell it to people. I\'m unclear as to how it will be different today.\n\nI still think there are ways to argue for more physically distributed mining, but tiny amounts of income for people (esp at a loss) is -- I think-- not likely to be it.\n\nIt does not help that virtually all "embedded mining" proposals I\'ve seen would basically hand control of the network over to a single party, if they were successful, as they\'ve all been based around tying back the work to a centralized pool (not even under user control).

Then all that needs to happen for the fork to begin is for a miner to build a block that is more than 1MB in size.\n\nOnce that happens, a couple outcomes are possible.    At that point there could be 75% of the combined total hashing capacity on  big blocks / Bitcoin-XT, or there could be 90%, or more even.   If that happens, where all essentially all mining moves to the big blocks / Bitcoin-XT chain, then that means consensus occurred and this "new coin" likely will become Bitcoin -- and assume the same market value, merchant adoption, ecosystem, etc. that Bitcoin has.   And you as an "everyday user" sees really no impact other than having to upgrade your software before the fork occurred.\n\nIf, instead, however the original chain (where the 1MB blocksize limit is still enforced) continues to be mined, then there are two coins -- BTCs (bitcoins mined on the original chain, and BTXs (coins mined on the big blocks / Bitcoin-XT chain).\n\nIf you have the private keys for your coins, then you are able to spend each of your pre-fork bitcoins as a BTC / bitcoin (e.g., with Bitcoin Core v0.11.x and earlier) and you can also spend each of these same pre-fork bitcoins as a BTX / coin using Bitcoin-XT.   To spend them this way you would first need to perform some action to "taint" your coins or, more likely, use a service that will do that for you.\n\nThe reason miners might still mine the original chain even after the hard fork occurs is because there is a market value for them.  For instance, let\'s say after the hard fork that newly mined BTCs (bitcoins / on the original chain) trade at $100, and newly mined BTXs (big block / on the Bitcoin-XT chain) trade at $120.   That\'s close enough that some miners might remain on the BTC / bitcoin side.   The problem is that today, nobody knows if there will be a market for these BTCs mined on the original chain.\n\nSome people want to proceed with big blocks / Bitcoin-XT even though the potential for the chains to bifurcate is very real -- especially because others believe such a development is harmful and will reject it.   We are nowhere near consensus on this. \n\nHaving two persistent chains after a hard fork is referred to as "catastrophic consensus failure".   \n\nAs an "everyday user" you shouldn\'t have to know that term.  But if Bitcoin-XT hard fork happens without consensus -- you may end up learning it real quick!': 5, 'Yes! The perfect answer =D': 1, "In many use-cases it's fairly similar to the spoon, if you're eating something that doesn't slip through the teeth when you use it in a comparable shoveling motion, but the main way it affects everyday users is that the teeth allow you to do things you could never do with a spoon, such as use it to hold a piece of food in place while you cut it with a knife in the other hand, or spear individual pieces of food to pick up and put in your mouth.": 2, 'Oh, one other detail.   If you are an "everyday user", you probably are then using an exchange (e.g., Coinbase, Circle, BitSTAMP), or have an e-wallet (e.g., Coinapult) or have a balance on some bitcoin-related service (e.g., online gambling site).   In nearly all those instances, you have your coins deposited with a service that has custody of those coins.\n\nIf the result of the hard fork is a persistent original chain as well as the big blocks / Bitcoin-XT chain, there really is no telling what will happen to your pre-fork coins.   If the service were to inform its users that it will be using the protocol implemeted by Bitcoin-XT then they might only have to honor that -- letting you use or withdraw your pre-fork balance as BTXs.   But if there is a non-trivial market value for BTCs and you only get to spend that balance as BTXs you\'ll probably not be happy, especially if the breakdown is something like $100 per BTC and $120 per BTX.\n\nEveryone likes to just assume that this scenario would be so terrible that it would never happen.

You will state some little known truth or view point but offer no evidence, then never respond to inquiries. ": 0, 'Softforks do not usually introduce bugs but fix them instead. In the case you mention, if the proof of work gets broken and needs fixing, this will necessarily require a hardfork.\n\nMore generally, in a decentralized system, the only thing you can do is to check whether the blockchain that you see is consistent with a set of rules. You cannot detect softforks. There is no way to know if the other peers have changed to a more restrictive version of one of the rules (i.e., softforked). They can refuse the blocks you mine because of rules or just because they want to.\n\nIf you do not mine, softforks do not break anything for you. You can can safely ignore them and go on validating without issues. You are not forced to upgrade and you can delay it until you have reviewed any proposed modifications.': 3, 'In Bitcoin, there is absolutely no way to know if a specific rule was followed.

In 0.12, we find a bug that creates invalid blocks with no proof of work that an old node will accept, but new nodes won't. \n\nThat bug would be a hard fork. Is isn't logical to force a hard fork just because a hard fork may happen on accident when non-consensus-breaking softfork are possible. It's like burning down a home to prevent a house fire.": 2, ">a block created on an updated node that hard forks, can not be validated by an older node.\n\nA block using the new hardfork rule will be rejected by an unpatched node.\n\n> A soft fork is when a new node won't validate a block created on an old node, but old nodes accept new updated blocks.\n\nNo. The extent of validation unpatched nodes can perform depends on the type of soft fork.\n\nFor example, when Satoshi released the update imposing the 1 MB block size limit (a soft fork), unpatched nodes continued full validation of every transaction and every block. Other kinds of soft forks, such as P2SH, changed the validation rules in such a way that unpatched nodes only knew some of them. So the nature of the soft fork determines how much validation unpatched nodes can do.\n\n>isn't soft forks a crazy dangerous way to introduce bugs for old nodes?\n\nIt depends on the update. Lowering the block size limit, for example, changed the rules of validation in a way that lets non-generating nodes continue following the active chain.\n\n>Unless I totally don't understand this stuff, isn't soft forks a crazy dangerous way to introduce bugs for old nodes?\n\nI'm not sure I understand the example. Consensus bugs, whether introduced through a soft fork or hard fork update, are harmful to Bitcoin.": 1, ">A soft fork is when a new node won't validate a block created on an old node, but old nodes accept new updated blocks. Correct?\n\nI believe new nodes **will** process blocks created by old nodes.  Someone else confirm. ": 3, '> As I understand it, a block created on an updated node that hard forks, can not be validated by an older node. A soft fork is when a new node won\'t validate a block created on an old node, but old nodes accept new updated blocks. Correct?\n\nNope, that\'s not correct. In fact it\'s closer to the exact opposite of that.\n\n- Soft fork -> more restrictive rules (or equally restrictive rules). New blocks will also be valid for older nodes that are not updated.\n\n- Hard fork -> less restrictive rules. New blocks may be invalid for older nodes, and they will reject them.\n\nThe terminology is a bit counter-intuitive but that\'s the way it is.\n\nThere are tricks to introduce features on a soft fork using bitcoin script, so that older blocks will accept the blocks despite not "knowing" the new functionality. This happened with P2SH.\n\nIn general forks are a dangerous thing to do. In general, playing with the block validity rules should be avoided, but then again Bitcoin is still in early days.\n\nThe problem we have is that some decisions are taken on whatever is the zeitgeist of the moment. When Satoshi introduced the 1MB limit, people were worrying about storage and about the blockchain getting too big. The one-true-way to use bitcoin was to run BitcoinQT, and download the whole blockchain. Now people are panicky about the number of transactions that can happen in the blockchain in real time as there was no other way to deal with bitcoins. In the meanwhile we had other discussions like "dust yes or no", Satoshidice being considered spam, etc etc also related with the fact that the blockchain gets bigger and there is no real fee market, as block generation is still so much more than the usual fees in a block.': 1, "Uh, soft vs hard fork is not a choice, it's a description of how a change naturally behaves.": 1, '"A hard fork is when the rules of the Bitcoin protocol change such that old nodes refuse to accept blocks created by newer nodes. As rule violating blocks are ignored, miners will produce blocks building on the last block they saw that followed their rule set.\n\n"A soft fork is when the rules of the Bitcoin protocol change such that old nodes don\xe2\x80\x99t realise the rules are different, and continue to accept blocks created by newer nodes that follow the changed rule set.

This happened last month with the Strict DER encoding soft fork change (BIP 66).   F2Pool, Antminer and others had been marking their blocks as having implemented this change (by tagging blocks with nVersion = 3).  However when the 95% threshold was reached, these pools were still extending on the chain that was not compliant with BIP 66.   As a result they were mining what they thought was the longest chain but nodes that had upgraded would reject their blocks.     \n\nNow a user using the old software saw blocks with multiple confirmations and they too were misguided as to what was the longest chain deemed valid by most of the rest of the network.   Fortunately, these pools either realized the issue or were notified of the problem and as a result shortly after that the "wrong" chain was soon overtaken by the chain with Strict DER encoding only.   \n\nThis might have given an opportunity for someone to double spend if they had been expecting this scenario (lots of hashing capacity marking nVersion=3 but not really supporting it by using Strict DER encoding).  That would have required some luck (in performing a race attack) and some quick action (trying to find an exchange that was on the wrong side of the fork).  Fortunately, it was deemed that all the transactions that had confirmed on the orphaned side later were also confirmed on the current longest chain.  i.e., that soft fork could have given Bitcoin a black eye regarding what a "confirmed transaction" meant.': 1, 'Yes. After a soft fork, old versions will still validate new blocks made according to the new rule. This is because the new rule is compatible with the old rule, but more strict.\n\nAn example from the Bitcoin world: first, there was no block size limit (it incidentally was something like 32MB because the P2P protocol doesn\'t support larger messages). So we can say the rule was "all blocks must be smaller than infinity". Then, a soft-fork was introduced that restricted this rule. The new rule was "no block can be bigger than 1MB". Clearly, if a block is 1MB or smaller, it is also smaller than infinity, so all blocks are valid under both the old rule and the new rule. Old clients will continue to receive blocks and check that they are smaller than infinity.\n': 2, 'Just as long as they are still valid under the new rules. It depends.\n\nNodes that only validate can ignore a softfork. Miners should upgrade.': 3, "> If you do not mine, softforks do not break anything for you. You can can safely ignore them and go on validating without issues. You are not forced to upgrade and you can delay it until you have reviewed any proposed modifications.\n\nIf this works for you then you probably didn't need to be running a full node in the first place.

In particular, this would have to be something global - which can be hard to agree on / synchronize.\n\nStill, the network does manage to set lots of global values.\n\nMaybe the "nonce" to "randomly" select the next block from the "blockpool" could be deterministically derived from the previous block itself. Just hash down the previous block to some number between 1 and 1,000,000 (using SHA plus a simple `mod` ie "modulus" or remainder operation). Even though the number wouldn\'t be random, at least it would throw a kind of monkey-wrench into the selection process: say the number is 567,126 - then all the nodes worldwide would be competing to have their block be the 567,126th block submitted.\n\nOr maybe things could be scrambled up even further - if the random number to select the next block were derived from a hash of all the blocks in the current blockpool. That would be based on something created in *this* 10-minute interval - less known than something created in the *previous* 10-minute interval.\n\nHash all the blocks in the blockpool, do `mod` over 1,000,000 - then this gives a number, say 567,126 - and then use this number to select the "winning" block to append. (Doesn\'t even have to be the 567,126th block - it could be some other hash-based derivation, which uniquely lets a single block in the "blockpool" be the "winning" block to be appended).\n\nThe idea here is just just jumble things up a bit - to "destroy" any advantage of having a fast internet connection.\n\nie - if the problem is telcos refusing to provide fast internet in certain countries / jurisdictions - then Bitcoin should try to avoid requiring a fast internet connection.\n\nWe only need the block to get *uploaded* - ie broadcast[ed] to the network.

"\n\n>The term "money transmission services" means "the acceptance of currency, funds, or other value that substitutes for currency from one person and the transmission of currency, funds, or other value that substitutes for currency to another location or person **by any means**."11\n\nSo, yeah.  If you accept dollars and then give bitcoin, to someone else, you\'re a money transmitter.  Money transmitters don\'t have an activity threshold.  Yes, this means if you sell $2 of bitcoin you are a money launderer.  It\'s insane and dumb but it\'s the law.\n\n>Might be that crazy regulators will put hurdles on that as well, but then you need a licenense to buy bread in the bakery as well\n\nYou\'re right, but they would argue that bread is different because bread is not an item of value that \'substitutes for currency\'\n': 2, "> I honestly don't understand why I have to identify myself to purchase Bitcoins.\n\nYou do not need any identification to buy bitcoins, and noone can prevent you from trading them anonymously.\n\nWhat you are running in to are requirements laid upon you by banks.\n\nIn specific; they have nothing to gain by helping people to opt out of their system, so they will make the process as difficult as possible.": 6, "because terrorists and criminal masterminds should be forced to deal with all logistics of dealing with huge amounts of cash. If only Walter White would've sold his meth for Bitcoin how simpler things would've been.": 15, 'Really? I never had to show any kind of id.': 1, 'They are trying to slow it down because they know whats coming. Do whatever it takes to get in this decade. ': 2, 'I convert cash to bitcoin for people as a side job, I will give bitcoin to anyone for cash, allowing them to remain anonymous. I do not follow KNC or AML. Works for me, and works for my customers. Heck, I will even sell to NY residents without a bitlicense.': 13, 'Communism implies some sort of equitable sharing of the plunder.\n\nThis is just naked Authoritarianism.': 6, '"No ID required" with LBC might be wrong, depending on where you use it. Legally, sellers are required (in some countries) to check IDs for trades above a certain amount and/or frequency (see Switzerland which has a very detailed guideline). Of course, it depends on your definition of "required" - technically, it\'s easier to skip verification with LBC.': 4, "So, if I opened up a brick and mortar Bitcoin-cash exchange I wouldn't need to collect identifying information on customers?": 4, 'yeah, pretty much every single US bank says the same thing - "we have to do X because of the Patriot Act" and of course it\'s total bullshit.': 1, "You're right.  I haven't been asked in the US, now that I think about it.  I have been asked in China though.  And I assume some currency exchange businesses have a policy of always asking for ID.": 1, 'Just shows how disconnected and unfair law system has developed. Unjustifiable legislation.': 1, "Isn't the thought of all these sites holding JPGs of our Passport and DL rather unnearving?  I mean with the number of data breaches that have happened I imagine most peoples DL and PP have been compromised.  This  makes the use of them as authoritative ID's pointless unless they can actually hold the physical document and compare it to the physical presenter. ": 0, '+1 for George Carlin, may he R.I.P. in peace.': 2, '> I can exchange dollars into yen or any other currency at the airport without any identifying information.\n\nI think that this is because you are exchanging anonymous, hard currency with anonymous, hard currency. In some ways, this is like localbitcoins or face-to-face exchange.': 5, 'Fema camps now accept Bitcoin': 0, "I know most people think this has to do with KYC / AML, but that's not the whole picture. Almost every non-cash payment method is reversible. Even wire transfers, bank transfers, email money transfers, western union payments can be reversed at some point. \n\nBitcoin sellers will normally ask for some information to identify their customers as a method of deterring fraud and/or to gain information if arbitration is needed.\n\nAsking for phone number (which allows sellers to verify with databases if it's a burner phone or not) and ID (allows sellers to verify if matches phone number records and physical address) greatly reduces the chances of chargeback, and increases the chances that the financial institution will rule in favor of the merchant in case of chargeback.": 2}}}
