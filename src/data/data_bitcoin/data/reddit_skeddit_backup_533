I personally believe it has a better than even chance of doing so, though I have no idea how long it might take.\n\nAnd finally, I personally have no interest in Bitcoin becoming stable.

If you're concerned about them changing versus USD, why don't you convert them into [bitusd](http://whatisbitusd.com/)?": 1, 'Gold has many more investors than bitcoin, and see how much that had helped.\n\nOne cause for the volatility of bitcoin is that its price is defined almost entirely by speculation: that is, because people buy it for X hoping that minutes or decades later other people will buy it for substantially more than X.  (If there was no speculation, the current use for e-payments would hardly support a price of 20 $/BTC.)  But since the future price too will be defined largely by speculation, the entire process hangs in the air like those cartoons where people do not fall only because they have not noticed that they are not being supported anymore.\n\nThus, any whiff of pessimism or optimism going through the speculators is enough to start the price rallying in one direction or the other, as other speculators react to the price change with the same change of mood.  Such excursions stop only because some speculators are not impressed by those mood waves and stick to their expectations of future prices.  \n\nAnother related reason for the volatility is that most of the available coin supply is locked in hoards of long-term speculators who expect astronomical gains years ahead.  Only a small fraction of the coins is in the hands of short-term traders who provide "liquidity" to the market -- that is, are willing to buy and sell at more modest prices.  Therefore, even small surges in demand or supply have a disproportionally large effect on the price.\n\nDue to the supposedly "deflationary" nature of bitcoin, both phenomena are likely to prevail in that hypothetical "billion users" scenario.  A finite supply with an increasing demand means that the price will be expected to go up even further.  That will attract speculative investment, which will result in the price being fixed to speculation and will lock up most of the coins in long-term hoards.  Any mood swing in the market (due, say, to wars or economy forecasts) will still cause self-feeding swings in the price, and any change in the real demand (such as Christmas shopping) will have a large effect on the price.': 1, "My guess is, he's going to the penn for five years and he needs to stash his private key someplace while he's in the joint.": 2}, ('Blockchain.info Profiles: LittleBitBack', 2): {}, ('Western Union and USPS as Bitcoin Exchanges?', 8): {"> I don't even want to think about the ridiculously high fees that Western Union would try to charge customers for using Bitcoin\n\nLocalbitcoin sellers often charge $20-30 over the prevailing price": 1, 'Yeah, that sucks too.\n\nHowever, with larger businesses, our goal should be to beat the rates charged by current money transmitters.

Gox, once the world\xe2\x80\x99s largest bitcoin exchange, collapsed last year and lost customers\xe2\x80\x99 assets worth half a billion dollars, dealing a major blow to the currency\xe2\x80\x99s public image.\n\nPrime Minister Shinzo Abe\xe2\x80\x99s Liberal Democratic Party, meanwhile, has decided that the government won\xe2\x80\x99t regulate bitcoin and won\xe2\x80\x99t assign any regulatory bodies to oversee the virtual currency ecosystem. While venture companies welcomed the news, executives at larger companies said the move made it difficult for them to start accepting bitcoin because they want a government agency as a watchdog. Otherwise they would face trouble should unfavorable incidents occur.\n\nRakuten has been open and passionate about bitcoin\xe2\x80\x99s potential use, hosting several panel talks dedicated to the subject at a recent financial conference hosted by the company. It has also invested in Bitnet Technologies, a bitcoin startup based in San Francisco.\n\nRakuten\xe2\x80\x99s biggest moneyspinner is its Japanese site, but that isn\xe2\x80\x99t open to bitcoin yet.

The big issue with Electrum right now is the privacy issues, as mentioned in this thread.": 3, "Short answer: Yes.\n\nLong answer: No.\n\nConsensus takes time. The network comes to consensus on the current state of the ledger/blockchain through performed and proven 'work'. For the state of the blockchain to be reverted to a certain point, the work that has been done since that point must be performed again. Therefore, the more work that's performed, the harder, and more unlikely, it becomes for the blockchain to be reverted to a previous state.\n\nPerforming work takes time. So, logically, it takes time to get to a point where transactions confirmed in the blockchain become, for all intents and purposes, irreversible.\n\nIt's important to note here that, **in theory**, *all transactions* can *always* be reverted *given enough work* to prove the existence of a new 'best chain'. (The idea is that this can't happen because it's practically impossible for any one person or organisation to perform that much work while the rest of the network is actively competing to perform the most work). It follows, though, that merchants can *never* be 100% confident a transaction is permanent, not if there's 1 confirmation, 5, 10 or 500. It'll approach 100%, but never get there. Doesn't matter what the confirmation time is, it could be 2 seconds or 2 hours: you can never be 100% confident.\n\nAt some point, though, merchants can realistically be confident enough to decide a transaction will not be reversed. They can factor the risk they take making this decision in the price of their product or service (the exact same thing happens to account for credit card fraud).\n\nThe decision to accept a payment can even be made while the transaction is unconfirmed. This, in addition to confidence in proof-of-work, requires you to be confident in the honesty of the payer and the network. Miners must not mine a double-spent transaction, and double-spends must be flagged while propagating, for example. The risk you're taking is, of course, higher than accepting a confirmed transaction, but not high enough to require a customer to wait before taking his coke off the counter.\n\nTo further increase confidence in an unconfirmed transaction, the merchant may use a payment processor, which could account for the added risk, or pro-actively monitor the network for double spends or otherwise fishy metrics. There's also instant-confirmation concepts (*not* the DarkCoin thing, which isn't a solution) that require you to trust a co-signer such as GreenAddress or centralized / custodial payment processors such as Coinbase which can somewhat guarantee a transaction will not be double-spent.\n\nIn practice, you'll find that for most reversible or over-the-counter *purchases*, the waiting time before a merchant will accept your transaction after having seen it, is 0. You'll be able to take your coke off the counter immediately after payment, even if the transaction is unconfirmed, or a book you've ordered on Amazon may be immediately processed (since the processing of the order may be cancelled by Amazon if the payment ends up being reversed or double-spent before confirmation).\n\nTL;DR - Consensus takes time, but that doesn't mean you'll have to wait that time.": 3, "How is that relevant?

The root cause is that you have to ask for just enough transactions to hide your tracks, but not so much that you're drowning in data.\n\nSatoshi's white paper points out the privacy implications of the public ledger idea pretty clearly.

A lot of merchants already do this, when I order pizza for btc I never have to wait for confirmations. First, it's at this moment pretty complicated to try and double spend a transaction, even an unconfirmed one. Second, it's possible to see the attempt, so within a couple of seconds you can be pretty sure it has not been tried, and to try it later makes it by far less likely to succeed. Third, payment processors probably insure against this and will in many cases probably involve law enforcement - is it worth trying to double spend the coke transaction after you walked out of the shop and then hope you did not get caught on a security camera which will easily be able to mach your face with the facebook profile picture?

Bitcoin Core relays transactions for other clients in a very similar way to the way it sends its own transactions (the process is identical, I believe, unless you restart Bitcoin Core before your transaction confirms[1]).  That means no one who is na\xc3\xafvely listening to your node can determine which transactions are yours and which are those that you're just relaying.\n\nBetter yet, Bitcoin Core doesn't send your transactions or other people's transactions to all of its peers immediately.  It introduces a small random delay for each peer before relaying.  That means transactions don't spread through the network in a fully-predictable manner based on latency, so even if a spy node is connected to every single node on the network, it can't assume that the first node it gets a transaction from is the node that originated that transaction.\n\nHow well does this all work?  When I look at the BlockChain.info page for my IP address---which has been static for about a year now---I see a whole bunch of transactions I know I didn't make associated with me (plausible deniability) and I don't see some transactions I did make (delayed relay).\n\nAs always, someone could be doing more in-depth analysis using IP address correlations with suspected change outputs, plus some network latency analysis, plus some other statistical vodoo.  However, I think Bitcoin Core over IPv4 does pretty well.  For better deniability, try using Tor.\n\n[1] I believe that if you restart Bitcoin Core, it will re-transmit any unconfirmed transactions in your wallet.  Other nodes will just forget about other people's unconfirmed transactions at restart, so they don't re-transmit them.": 9, 'Thank you for taking the time to suggest those links.

The fees will be too large.\n\nI'm not sure I agree with that.\n\nEven using payments channels you'll have to settle on the blockchain eventually - paying a fee. The network must be subsidized through these fees (assuming block rewards are nil, for a second), so those fees would have to be sizeable enough for there to be enough incentive to properly secure the network. Whether this incentive is paid for by fees of individual coke transactions, or fees of payments channel settlements doesn't matter, the aggregate amount must be the same for network security to be the same. So whichever method of payment becomes most prevalent (individual transactions, or payments channels), it has no impact on the cost of each transaction - the amount must be enough to pay for decent security eventually.\n\nIe. you can have 100 transactions lumped into a single settlement transactions using a payments channels, but if everyone does this then fees of these settlement transactions must inevitably rise for network security to remain the same. Or, equivalently, individual coke-transaction fees directly on the blockchain must decrease (assuming incentive for security doesn't increase).": 1, "Is bitcoin really divisible enough to become a global currency?

Imagine a floor with a trapdoor over a deep hole. You can fall in very easily and get stuck. However, you can only get out if you have a ladder, or expend a lot of physical work and time digging your way out.\n\nSome mathematical functions work like a physical trapdoor in that they easily run in the forward direction. But running them in reverse requires either: (1) knowledge of a secret; or (2) a lot of time and computational power.\n\nTrapdoor functions start out as reversible functions. Multiplication is a good example. It yields a product from two factors. Factorization runs multiplication in reverse, producing two factors given a product. Factorization is easy regardless of the size of the numbers because division is easy and there are so many correct answers. However, factoring the product of two primes takes much more work. There is only one pair of factors.\n\nWe can build a simple authentication system based on prime number multiplication and factorization. Here\'s how it works. I begin by choosing a secret key consisting of two prime numbers S1 and S2. Then, I multiply S1 and S2 together to give my public key, P.\n\nI send you P via email, but keep S1 and S2 secret. We schedule an in person meeting. When we greet, you give me P. This is the challenge. I give you S1 and S2 as my response.\n\nYou can confirm that both S1 and S2 are prime numbers and that when multiplied together they give P. This proves my identity. Notice that I didn\'t have to send S1 or S2 via email, yet you are now convinced that I am the person who sent you the email. Pretty amazing when you think about it.\n\nLet\'s say my evil twin Chuck arranges for me to be absent from our meeting while he takes my place. Chuck doesn\'t know S1 or S2 but plans to fake it. You give him P and he starts grinding away to find prime factors S1 and S2. He eventually finds them and gives them to you. Chuck has broken our authentication system.\n\nThe fix is simple - we use larger prime numbers dozens of digits long. When you give Chuck P, he now faces a nightmarish computational challenge. S1 and S2 are very large prime numbers, so Chuck needs to search a huge range of possible S1 and S2. If these values are large enough, Chuck simply won\'t be able to brute force a solution. He\'ll be unmasked as an impostor.\n\nOf course, our authentication system has problems. The biggest problem is that I prove my identity by giving you S1 and S2. You could easily take these values and impersonate me. So I need a way to prove that I know S1 and S2 without giving them to you.

Easy, simple. But to revert this, and get the prime factors of 15 is hard (mathematically). There's no straightforward way to do this, you'll have to try every option until you get the right answer. Substitute 3 and 5 with big ass 2048-bit primes and you'll make it computationally impossible to do, the problem becomes exponentially harder to solve when the problem grows linearly.\n\nNote though, bitcoin doesn't use privpubkeys based on this problem, and with it, it doesn't use prime numbers (RSA).

However, given nothing more than an address, it's impossible to find the other addresses in a deterministic wallet.\n\n>Likewise if you have an older school wallet (non deterministic), is it possible or easy to determine all other addresses in that wallet?\n\nNo. Given just one address, this isn't possible.

On the software side, a number of solutions support it, for example BitPay\'s Android checkout app.\n\n> What NFC solutions are on the horizon?\n\nPersonally I am interested in the combination of NFC and smartwatches. Once Android Wear provides NFC APIs, it should be fairly straightforward to complete the payment at the Bitcoin Box by just touching the watch there (and confirming it in some way).': 0, 'Because I am broke': 1, "Glad to hear that you had a positive experience! The Bitcoin Box also has a QR code display, so that always remains as an option.\n\nMy prediction though is, that NFC will become increasingly more relevant over the next months/years, as more devices start to support it. I'm fairly sure that Apple will also make NFC accessible to its apps soon rather than later.\n\nIt's of course a subjective thing, but I find scanning QR codes fairly clunky. In bad lighting situation, it can take a while to get a proper scan. NFC has the advantage, that you don't even need to open an app. Touching the phone on the box will automatically open your wallet. And NFC opens up the possibility to pay with a smartwatch.": 4, '> Why use this when i can use a Android Bitcoin POS with any cheap Smartphone?\n\nTwo reasons why I decided against Android phones as the platform: First, I would like to have this plug into existing cash registers at some point. RJ45 is something that\'s used for this here in Germany and the Raspberry Pi provides that out of the box.\n\nSecondly, I feel that if you are targeting a mix of Android devices, you usually end up with a mediocre experience on all of them. I think by committing to one specific hardware platform, we can better achieve a polished payment flow.\n\n> Unless you are selling the whole package the Merchant needs to have some basic knowledge of how he wants to implement your solution.\n\nAgreed, therefore I am considering to provide that as a service later, to essentially put together "the whole package" for someone who doesn\'t want to deal with the DIY stuff. That service could also be provided by someone else, as all the parts will be available.': 2, 'Well that sounds perfect.

Here in Germany there are regulations regarding the cash register itself, for example to make sure that records cannot be tampered with afterwards in order to prevent tax evasion. And then there are security guidelines if you are reading credit or debit cards. This box is definitely not designed to replace the whole cash register, but needs to work in tandem with one. In that setup, the box itself doesn't need any specific certificates, as far as I am aware.\n\n> does your POS terminal software also include full functionality for handling cash?\n\nNo, as per above, this box only deals with accepting Bitcoin payments. In fact, one plan would be to later have the box act like a standard EMV chip and pin terminal from the perspective of the cash register. This way the cash register doesn't need to specifically support Bitcoin, it just delegates to the supposedly-EMV-chip-and-pin terminal, which in reality lets the user pay via Bitcoin instead.\n\n> Does your software include CSV exports of transaction\n\nYes, the box will make use of BitPay on the backend, which supports various export formats.": 3, "Three questions:\n\n1) Are there regulations guiding the security practices around POS terminals, at least in the US? Or could someone combine a basic PC with a USB cash drawer and specially built screen for POS situations and call it a legal cash register?\n\n2) If any COTS components could qualify and you're describing the typical parts that could be used to host your POS terminal software, does your POS terminal software also include full functionality for handling cash? What about credit/debit cards? Are there generic EMV chip and pin terminals available at reasonable prices to the general public?\n\n3 Does your software include CSV exports of transaction details suitable for import into accounting software like QuickBooks?\n\nFor the small shop owner, I'm wondering if it would be worth it to convince them to add a live Internet drop into their store, or if it would be more cost effective to just turn on tethering on their cell phone to provide the needed Internet connection to your POS terminal.": 4, 'Good luck! $2 /u/changetip': 4, 'not pledging because im poor haha.

The easiest way to get there is that existing POS solutions simply add Bitcoin support. But if an engineer from one of those big boys look at the space today, they see a bunch of unresolved open questions. Like proposed BIPs that specify how Bitcoin and NFC plays together, but is only half-implemented at this point. Sure, maybe that big boy company is going to step in and push the process forward themselves. But what I\'m proposing is that a Bitcoiner (me!) explores the space with a solution like this, makes it work from top to bottom and puts it out there as a "best practice" example.\n\nOnce we have that, it becomes so much easier for the big boy engineer to estimate what it will take to integrate Bitcoin into their big boy POS solution. It\'s all a process, no? I\'m just proposing that the community supports me in pushing things forward a few more steps.

POS systems handle a good deal more than just payment processing. Unless you build a full-featured POS system incorporating also cash handling, credit card transactions, inventory management, sales analytics and all the other features a merchant needs, then this can\'t compete as a sole replacement.\n\nIntegrating with an existing POS package is more doable. But most of the big POS vendors (in the US at least, I can\'t speak for EU) do not provide API access or any kind of open extensibility (there are some limited exceptions, Revel comes to mind, but in general the systems are pretty closed access). It may be difficult to integrate your device as an open-source developer without contractual agreements with the vendor. And then why do this in hardware at all?\n\nAnd a non-integrated stand-alone bitcoin terminal in addition to a standard POS system is a no-go. POS is tightly integrated into accounting and inventory management software. I\'d have to manually enter the bitcoin transactions, deduct inventory and whatever else to get these transactions included.\n\nAnother thing, which wasn\'t appreciated by, for instance, the tinkerers who made the bitcoin ATMs that fail so spectacularly is that the service model is a hugely important piece. If the POS system has an issue, the business needs that 24 hour service department to help an unskilled store manager get back to ringing people up. I can\'t do tech support on a Raspberry Pi (as awesome as I think they are) in the middle of the day in order to complete a customer\'s sale.\n\nAnother issue, maybe unpopular to mention here is that in the day to day retail world nobody really wants to pay with bitcoin. Believe me I try. I accept bitcoin in my current POS system and it doesn\'t get a whole lot of use, despite a discount, stickers, signs and press releases. I\'m sure this varies place-to-place and industry-to-industry but the total uptake is just too low at this time to justify spending anything on POS bitcoin unless, like those ATM owners, you\'re doing it for ideological reasons instead of actually running the numbers and doing it for business reasons.\n\nThe larger issue I see is the difficulty in buying bitcoins for the average person. Unfortunately, the impediments are more political and regulatory and not technical. Until the utility and value gained by using bitcoin exceeds the effort required to obtain them, their retail use is not going to edge out credit cards or cash.': 6, 'Donated.': 2, "> You are trying to build a company.\n\nI don't think selling these devices will be a viable business.

I believe a great accelerator is to provide a reference system like this and in the process make sure that all the standards are worked out. So I consider it a stepping stone.

Thus far, in the entire trading industry, there is not a single open source product (of scale) available. One of the reasons is if you do open source it, the competition will simply take it.": 3, 'I\'m going to engage in this debate for the sake of clarification in regards to risk vs. reward. Let me state now, and in CAPS that this is NOT directed at any one particular exchange or intended to assert that ANY particular exchange(s) are subpar. Bitcoin exchanges are on a fantastic growth curve and I\'m happy to see that. What I am doing is debunking certain myths as I see them. With that disclaimer out of the way, let me address your assertions.\n\nYou said "The top 5 bitcoin exchanges are trusted centralized web services". How is it that they are trusted? They are private companies that are not even domiciled in the US. You have no access to their balance sheet reporting, funding levels, or risk management/mitigation processes. This trust is not proven, even if it is deserved. We are a pure software concern. You have absolutely no exposure to our balance sheet.\n\nYou said, "They don\'t have to ask users to download and execute binaries, instead they just demand users send their passports and their coins." So, you don\'t have to execute binaries, you just send in your identification and capital? You say that as if its a good thing, and it is not! It was a necessary thing because users are accustomed to the legacy way of doing things before very recently there was no other way of doing things, but blockchain technology allows us to evolve past this high risk method of doing things - it allows us to evolve into a zero trust or low trust method of exchanging value. Let\'s contrast this legacy method of exchanging value to our P2P, low/zero trust system of trading and value exchange. \n\nWe have no access to your identification or identity - at all, and don\'t care to have any. We have no access to your capital - at all - and don\'t care to. We don\'t have possession, access, or control of any of your coin. Your capital stays either in your wallet or the blockchain and when in-contract via the blockchain is easily traceable via the push of a button via our wallet which stays on your machine and is never hosted by us. You don\'t have to be concerned about our servers going down, being hacked, or confiscated because you never sent your coin to our servers to begin with and each contract has catastrophic rollback measures embedded in case our servers are some caught in a bi-coastal earthquake during a global meteor storm. You can\'t say that about "trusted centralized web servers.\n\nYou said, "If I have to download and execute a binary (instead of compiling it from code myself), I have to trust the company releasing it when they promise me there\'s no malware bundled inside that will steal my coins."\nBut don\'t you have to trust the exchange not to have bad agents, rogue software on their centralized server, and airtight security not to steal your coins once you send them in. \nIf that\'s not enough, don\'t you have to trust their capital adequacy, liquidity, counterparty risk, hedges and management competence, prudence and fidelity in order to get your money back?\nHow about shifts in regulation that may allow authorities to confiscate coin?\nMt. Gox, Lehman, Bear Stearns, Man Financial, etc. Centralized financial concerns have lost more capital for investors and customers than malware every has, or ever could lose... By far!\nIn addition, you ALWAYS have the option to trace any and all transactions made through our wallet. It\'s really just a smart contract aware bitcoin wallet, and it has a trace function that tracks all contract transactions - all of them. Thus, if there were any coins stolen, you\'d be able to find out immediately (or at least within the 1st confirmation or two). Here\'s a live, pending contract from my personal wallet - traced and tracked https://blockchain.info/tx/d0bcfb2bceb399c70f511a0a85aad5ae629e59b0bd3f5f87d36ecf42322f695f?show_adv=true This cannot be done with conventional and legacy systems and represents a new level of trust and transparency.': 3, 'Still closed-source?

To begin with, we are referencing two different (but highly inter-related) products from my company. \n\nVeritaseum is is the value trading platform - the "smart contract aware bitcoin wallet". It is "zero trust" or "low trust", depending on how its implemented. \n\nVeritas is the "software token" for Veritaseum that can be used to purchase products and services - or traded freely OTC or through an exchange. The token is actually backed by the intellectual capital and labor of my team (and even me, see http://veritaseum.com/index.php/buy-veritas). The example given shows how Goldman could have bought $2M worth of the token and had us build low trust/zero trust solutions into their FICC with a high degree of familiarity with their trading business. That integration would use our Veritaseum API, of course.\n\nNow, if Goldman were to make such a purchase, the aggregate value of Veritas would likely increase due to supply vs demand.\n\nTo answer your 2nd set of questions:\n"is there liquidity for trades"\nWe\'re working on that.

Anyone who does multi-sig on the same device is not doing it right.': 8, '1 - The offline wallet is simply a public/private keeper. The company can send funds to the public key, but when they need to withdraw they need to go to the bank to retrieve the private key; Correct me if I\'m wrong, but i don\'t think that there is any way that you can create a private key that can only send to a certain address?\n\n2 - You\'re right, this seems odd. But given that their total loss is capped at 1,000 BTC, it\'s not a huge deal, I don\'t think, as they could pay that from their own reserves if they needed to.\n\n3 - I think it\'s incredibly wise to split up their cold storage among a large number of private keys. IF they just just need to top off their online wallet, just grab a single private key from the vault and add 1,000 BTC to it. Far more straight forward, and less prone to risks, than needing to transact from a single offline wallet - send 1,000 BTC to the online wallet and send the remainder to a new offline wallet; then having to propagate that new public key to everyone who needs to be able to monitor it.  \n\n4 - You\'re looking at only outflows but not inflows; I\'m certain that when figuring out reserves, they set them at a level that minimizes trips to the bank. In other words, you\'re looking at the 3% of funds that are online, and suggest that they must regularly receive requests to withdraw 4% of their funds (or more), but not factoring in that they also receive bitcoins on a regular basis.\n\nIf you consider that bitcoin "depositors" are Coinbase probably act the same as ordinary depositors at banks, and not just that, many hold their coins for investment purposes rather than to immediately spend, turning over 3% of funds on a daily basis just seems incredibly unlikely. On average, the number of bitcoins held in their system probably increases day by day, month by month. They\'re not having to run to the bank every day to grab private keys to service withdrawal requests. More likely, they have their preset reserve level (lets say 10,000 BTC), and each day, they sweep the excess to a private key in their system, moving on to the next one once they\'ve funded that key with 1,000 BTC.\n\nI don\'t personally see alarm bells going off as a result of their disclosure; \n\n5 - Multisig seems preferable, yes. But with the two people with access to the private keys on the exact opposite sides of the planet, one will be sleeping when the others awake and vice versa. Meaning that when they do need to make transfers from cold to hot, there would be a delay while they waited for the second signatory to wake up, verify the transaction, and then add their own signature to it. And any delay in allowing coin withdrawals would be met with howls from the BTC community, who would all assume a new MTGox situation.\n\nSo in that light, multisig might not be optimal; again, they\'ve structured it to cap their losses at 1,000 BTC, which i assume they can easily make up for from their own funds if need be; again, there are two competing goals, one is to keep customer funds safe, and two, to be able to service withdrawal requests in a timely basis. \n\nI don\'t know - I\'m not nearly as alarmed as you are. I think most of their procedures make perfect sense, in fact. No reason for them to lie about it, if they didn\'t want their customers to know how they handled offline wallets, they simply wouldn\'t have published anything at all.

After all, a bitcoin address is derived from a private key, but there are no \\[known\\] inherent issues with publishing an address widely.\n\nI said that a public key is derived from a private key, and that a public key is normally published only when submitting a transaction (which, of course, requires acces to the private key), so a public key *is* essentially hidden along with the private key.\n\nI also said that there is, however, a security value in keeping a public key hidden, because flaws in random number generators (and the like) can *and have* allowed for deriving private keys from public keys (when bitcoin addresses are reused). If quantum computers ever become a possibility, there is already an algorithm to derive a private key from a public key fairly quickly through brute force; yet, there is no such algorithm for deriving a private key from a bitcoin address.\n\nPGP is ancient software, and was designed when computing systems were fairly primitive, and before [Shor's quantum algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shor%27s_algorithm) was formulated.

The only time that OKCoin\'s employees would need to visit the bank would be to retrieve the private key, in order to construct a transaction to send funds back to their hot wallet.\n\nRe-reading your posts though, there is a bit of alarm. This is all rooted in my questioning of OP\'s "concern" that funds in cold storage could be mis-directed, and that therefore there should be a whitelist of where those coins can be sent.\n\nI felt that they had sufficiently protected themselves against a complete wipeout by breaking their cold storage down to a series of wallets, each containing only 1,000 BTC; second I questioned the validity of the white list argument. For one, that technology doesn\'t exist - you can\'t send funds to one address (the cold storage wallet) and then limit where that wallet can send funds to. \n\nAs you point out, maybe in the future that will be a possibility, but I think the bitcoin community would howl if such measures ever came under active consideration. Some have gone so far to say that Bitcoin would lose its fundamental value of whitelisting (and therefore, blacklisting) were to make it into Bitcoins core code. \n\nBut anyways. I apologize for my misguided use of the words "public key" when I should have said "wallet address".\n\nSide question, because, again, it sounds like you know more than me. You say that since the public key is derived from the private key, it has an important security value?\n\nBased on my understanding of public key crypto, I don\'t see where the risk is, unless it\'s a risk that is unique to its implementation in Bitcoin itself; your PGP public key is meant to be shared with the world, as it is (or should be, barring any significant advances in mathematics) impossible to derive a private key simply by knowing what the public key is.\n\nSeparating the misnaming of Bitcoin address and public key, how does sharing of the public key put the private key at risk? Is there something specific to Bitcoin that could allow an attacker who possessed knowledge of an addresses public key to derive the private key from it?

Neither does a private key send anything anywhere.\n\nThe Bitcoin network processes transactions; to own BTC is to be able to construct a valid transaction referencing at least one other existing valid transaction. Each transaction specifies how its outputs may be used to construct a new valid transaction, and this specification is written in a kind of programming language that is understood by each node in the Bitcoin network; that is, how BTC may be spent is something that can be programmed.\n\nRight now, the most common way to program how BTC may be spent is to say that a certain cryptographic private key must be used to digitally sign a message giving the OK for a new transaction to be made.\n\nHowever, there are other ways to program how BTC may be spent; if Bitcoin's programming language is ever made sufficiently expressive, it would be quite easy to specify such whitelists.\n\nThat being said, a whitelist in this scenario is kind of silly, because it amounts to requiring multiple signatures, which is more directly handled already.": 1, "over excitable techies huh.
