So GAW wants to charge people thousands of dollars to store their coins for them with PoS. All I can say is... what the fuck?? I've only ever felt bad for GAW's customers, but now I'm almost at the point where I feel like people deserve to lose their money if they're buying this crap.": 5, 'Lol': 3, 'GAW as a Primary Market Maker\n\nThis is where we come in. GAW will be one of many Market Makers (Prime Controller owners) who will make Paycoin successful. We thought long and hard about how we could not only create a market for Paycoin (Paybase), but share that success with the people who made this company what it is today! HashStaker is our way of bringing this all together.\n\nGAW Miners will invest tens of millions of dollars to earn as many Prime Controllers as we can, to obtain as much of the total stake rate for Paycoin as possible. We\xe2\x80\x99ll then distribute that stake rate to you in the form of a special Prime Controller-connected wallet that we will host for you within Zencloud.\n\nThe Solution is Here\n\nToday, we take an enormous step forward in mining, bigger than this company and its customers have ever made before. From this point forward, you can say goodbye to the days of slaving away to keep up with the \xe2\x80\x9cdifficulty curve\xe2\x80\x9d, dealing with declining payouts, and paying for electric costs and maintenance fees that eat into your payouts.\n\nToday, we introduce an entirely new class of currency generating device.\n\nWe Call it the HashStaker \xe2\x80\x93 The World\xe2\x80\x99s First Cloud Staking Wallet.\n\nHashStaker is not a Hashlet. It\xe2\x80\x99s an entirely new generation of currency generating devices; one that works with Prime Controllers and Proof of Stake. We\xe2\x80\x99ve taken everything you love about mining, and created a product where you can more reliably judge its profitability over time.\n\nOf course, this means exactly what you would expect: You will be able to generate next-generation PoS cryptocurrencies, like Paycoins, more reliably and profitably than ever before. However, here is the thing, HashStaker works on a completely new generation of currency technology, that no one else has, like PoS utilizing Prime Controllers.\n\nHashStaker wallets payout new currency and use next-generation technology that makes them capable of things you could only dream of with a traditional mining rig. Features like:\n\nNo-drops in payouts for their entire lifespan.\nComplete immunity to difficulty increases.\nZero maintenance fees. Forever!\nThe highest payouts of any miner, period.\nCustomizable \xe2\x80\x93 only buy what you need.\nGuaranteed 99.99% uptime.\nAnd, the most exciting thing about HashStakers is their profitability!\n\nAt our planned investment amount, your HashStakers will consistently reach ROI in 2.5-4.5 months! What miner can do that? :grinning[:)]:\n\nAnd, we\xe2\x80\x99ve only scratched the surface. You will soon be able to trade them, sell them, and amp them when Hashbase is released.\n\nHow do HashStakers Work\n\nA HashStaker is a cloud based \xe2\x80\x9cSuper Wallet\xe2\x80\x9d that we host for you in your ZenCloud account,, and leave open so it can stake. Since they are installed on our servers, they will stake at a rate equal to all the Prime Controllers GAW is managing.\n\nHere is the breakdown:\nSince HashStakers are cloud based wallets, they require coins to start staking. The first HashStaker we built is for Paycoin, and we will add more in the future.\n\nPaycoin HashStaker wallets require a Paycoin to be in the HashStaker wallet for it to stake, of course. Once you transfer your Paycoin to it, your HashStaker will start to stake, and be paid out each day with the normal daily payout times.\n\nHashStaker\xe2\x80\x99s wallets are customizable. You can choose the size (how many Paycoins they can hold), and the duration of time you want them for, which means you only need to pay for the time you want. We are starting with three and six month time frames, adding more intervals in the future.\n\nOnce you select the HashStaker you want, it will appear in ZenCloud just like Hashlets do.\n\nWhen the Prime Round starts (explained below), the final stake rate will be established. As an added measurement of comfort, you will have 24 hours to return the HashStaker for a full refund if you are not happy with the rate.\n\nOnce the Prime Round starts, your HashStaker stake rate and wallet address will display on your HashStaker. You then have the ability to transfer your Paycoin to the HashStaker wallet.\n\nTransferring coins to your HashStaker activates it, starts staking your coins with GAW\xe2\x80\x99s Prime Controllers, and locks in your payout at that round\xe2\x80\x99s rate for your entire HashStaker duration (three or six months).\n\nIt will payout to your ZenCloud wallet each day like your normal Hashlet payouts. Transferring your Paycoin to your HashStaker wallet will also start the timer.\n\nOnce the HashStaker expires, it will transfer the original Paycoin back into your ZenCloud account and be done staking.\n\nThe First Prime Round\n\nWhen Paycoin officially debuts, mid-December, GAW will bid on Prime Controllers to compete for one of the highest staking potentials on the Paycoin network.\n\nThis total stake rate will then be controlled and owned by HashStaker owners.\n\nLet me make this absolutely crystal clear. GAW\xe2\x80\x99s entire Paycoin Prime Controller stake rate will be owned by, and distributed to HashStaker owners. And, since Prime Controllers go back into bidding every six months, HashStakers will work on a 6-month round system, which lock-in their rates for that entire period.\n\nThis means your profitability is guaranteed for the entire duration that your HashStaker is active. Not everyone can own a HashStaker, but everyone who owns one will be profitable.\n\nRound One Start Date: Mid-December\nRound One estimated payout: Between .0075 and .01 Paycoins per day\n\nThese numbers are based on our mining and investments made thus far in the ICO. We will declare the final number once the round begins.\n\nToday, HashStaker Wallet Reservations Start\n\nOne of the many things that make HashStakers different from traditional miners is scarcity.\n\nThere is no restriction on how much traditional mining hardware can be created \xe2\x80\x93 that should be clear to everyone by now, looking at global hash rates. Theoretically, everyone on the planet could own a miner.\n\nNot so with HashStakers. There is a hard limit on the amount of HashStaker Wallets that can exist.\n\nWhen all HashStaker wallets are sold from GAW\xe2\x80\x99s Prime Controller inventory for each Prime Round (which lasts six months), no more HashStakers can exist for that round. At that point, the only way to obtain one is in in the Hashbase Market, shortly after Hashbase launches.\n\nToday, we are selling the first HashStaker wallet reservations for the first Prime Round, starting in mid-December. Once you have reserved your HashStaker wallet, that address will belong uniquely to you.\n\nYou can return your HashStaker for a full refund up until 24 hours after the Prime Round starts, for any reason. If you request a return, your HashStaker wallet address will be released back to the pool of wallet addresses to be purchased.\n\nHow Does Ordering Work?\n\nI know this is exciting and sounds all very new. But, don\xe2\x80\x99t worry. Setting up a HashStaker is easy:\n\nHead to ZenCloud or GAW Miners to purchase your HashStaker Wallet.\nDecide the size of the HashStaker (amount of coins it can hold), and if you want it for a full or half Prime Round duration (three or six months). HashStakers cannot be merged or split, but you can buy them in any configuration and have as many as you want until they are sold out.\nObtain Paycoin \xe2\x80\x93 Either through the second ICO round, or buying coins from Paybase (a single one or multiple, depending on your HashStaker size).\nOnce Round One Stake rate is declared, staking period can start.\nTransfer Paycoins from your Paycoin Wallet to your HashStaker.\nEnjoy getting daily payouts that never decrease.\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s that simple. Since each HashStaker is its own wallet, each HashStaker has its own wallet address. Once the first Prime Round starts, you will receive a HashStaker wallet address for your reserved HashStaker.\n\nTransferring coins to your HashStaker activates it to start staking your coins with GAW\xe2\x80\x99s Prime Controllers, and locks in your payout at that round\xe2\x80\x99s rate for your entire HashStaker duration (three or six months). And, when it expires, the coins inside automatically transfer back to your ZenCloud account.\n\nRemember, you can return your HashStaker for a full refund for up to 24 hours after round one stake rate is declared.\n\nDisclaimer: The HashStaker Wallet price is relative to the stake rate. The higher the stake rate, the more valuable a HashStaker Wallet is. We have provided a range on what the Round One stake rate will be (in first Prime Round section).\n\nTo provide the best value to our customers, we started at a lower price ($9.95). Depending on demand, we reserve the right to increase new HashStaker purchases.\n\nOnce the Round Once Stake rate is declared, we will increase the HashStaker Wallet prices for new purchases to match the locked in Stake Rate.\n\nCurrent Hashlet Owners\n\nWe haven\xe2\x80\x99t forgotten about you. You will soon have the choice to upgrade to HashStakers. Next week, we announce the upgrade path for Primes, Zens, and other Hashlets.\n\nWe have to limit the time, obviously, because the number of HashStakers available is limited, which means we have to carefully control our HashStaker inventory.\n\nBut, all Hashlet Primes already have a HashStaker Wallet reserved. Why? Because you\xe2\x80\x99re Prime :grinning[:)]:.\n\nTaking the Next Step Forward\n\nFrom this day onward, cryptocurrency will never be the same.\n\nHashStaker changes everything about mining. With features like being refundable, zero maintenance fees, locked in payouts, scarcity, no difficulty increases, guaranteed up-time with complete insurance coverage, and ROIs like never before. HashStakers are, without a doubt, the biggest leap forward in mining we\xe2\x80\x99ve ever offered. Period.\n\nIn the future, people will look back at the history of mining and wonder why it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t this way all along.\n\nFor more info please visit http://roiminers.co.za/hashstaker-2/': -4, "Yeah lol.

Just got the same newsletter.\n\n=\n\n**Update: ChangeTip's Security Practices**\n\nBy victoriavaneyk on 26 Nov 2014\n\nEveryone wants to make sure that their money is safe and secure. We understand that we are asking [ChangeTip](https://www.changetip.com) users to trust us with their funds, so, in the spirit of transparency, here are some more details on how ChangeTip thinks about securing your bitcoin, and the steps we take to make sure that your funds are safe.\n\nNote that this isn\xe2\x80\x99t meant to be a complete security practice document, but a blog post that answers some of the most common questions and concerns.\n\n**Your funds are your funds**\n\nMost financial institutions, including banks, don\xe2\x80\x99t actually keep all of their customers\xe2\x80\x99 funds available for withdrawal. They take your deposit, and then they run what is called a [Fractional Reserve](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractional-reserve_banking). This allows them to make money on your money while they hold it, through loans, interest, and other investments.\n\nAt ChangeTip, we are not a fractional reserve. ChangeTippers\xe2\x80\x99 funds are held in a completely separate account, and we don\xe2\x80\x99t use your money for anything - we simply store it securely.\n\n**The hot wallet and offsite storage**\n\nTo further enhance security against hacking or a server compromise, we keep a small percentage of funds in our Hot Wallet, which is the wallet that withdrawals are processed from. We target this being about 1% of the available pool of user funds.\n\nFor the other 99% of funds, we move it off of our servers to a more secure location - our Offsite Storage wallet. This means that if our servers are hacked, the maximum amount that the hackers would have access to is the Hot Wallet (about 1% of funds), which the company will stand behind.\n\n**Proof of Reserve**\n\nOur Offsite Storage wallet is on the Blockchain, and you can [see it here](https://blockchain.info/address/3J3DTkxkEoPeXyo4t9wNaKLbQpj5Vh7zUG). This is a bold move for transparency on our part, and should provide some assurance that we have the reserves available for all funds, and that we welcome community oversight on that address.\n\n**How we protect the User Storage Wallet**\n\nKeen observers may have noticed that the wallet address we supplied above starts with a 3, which means it is a [multi-signature address](http://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/3718/what-are-multi-signature-transactions/3729?utm_source=ChangeTip&utm_campaign=bde010d677-RSS_EMAIL_CAMPAIGN&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_edff094ad0-bde010d677-191183745#3729).\n\nWe have a system set up where two team members at ChangeTip have to approve any withdrawals.  This prevents any single individual from being able to go rogue. And yes, of course those accounts are protected with two-factor authentication for login and withdrawal.\n\nSoon, we\xe2\x80\x99ll be announcing even more about how we\xe2\x80\x99ll accomplish this in the future with a trusted wallet partner. Stay tuned.\n\n**Private Key Management**\n\nWe manage ChangeTip users\xe2\x80\x99 private keys. For a product like ChangeTip, we believe that\xe2\x80\x99s the right decision for two reasons:\n\nFirst, we want to keep tips free and instant, so the tip transactions happen \xe2\x80\x9coff chain.\xe2\x80\x9d If you were building a gambling site, you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have a transaction for every blackjack hand; you would have one when the player sat down at the table, and another when they left the table. For us, it\xe2\x80\x99s the same: We only do a Bitcoin transaction when there is a deposit or withdrawal - tips are maintained on an internal ledger.\n\nSecond, being centralized enables us to keep the wallet creation process convenient. A lot of people have told us that what they love about ChangeTip is how easy it is for them to show a brand new user what Bitcoin is - without having to explain the details of private keys, public keys, cold storage, QR codes, and other issues that the typical person shies away from.  Remember, we are trying to drive the mass consumer adoption of Bitcoin, so we need to keep it simple.\n\nChangeTip has generated a tremendous amount of new activity recently for the Bitcoin community, and a cornerstone of that is a simple process for people who are new to Bitcoin, providing an easy, low-friction way to experience Bitcoin for the first time.\n\n**Auditability**\n\nIn the next few months, we will bring in a trusted, external third party to verify the points above. This will be a person and/or entity that has gained the community\xe2\x80\x99s trust from a security perspective, but who doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have a vested interest in ChangeTip for proper neutrality. If you\xe2\x80\x99d like to volunteer, please get in touch.\n\n**In sum, your funds are safe at ChangeTip**\n\nThrough this separation of keys and the addition of security policies and best practices, we aim to effectively manage risk and keep your funds safe.\n\nWe are working hard to stay up-to-date with the latest security best practices.   Stay tuned for additional updates, including partnership announcements. \n\n\nAll the best,\n\nNick Sullivan,\nCEO, ChangeTip\nnick@changetip.com": 9, 'Black Friday claims another victim.': 0, 'Source?': 4, 'This is great!': 7}, ('Would you use a Laminated Paper wallet or a Trezor (10 yr btc storage option)', 2): {"Some electronics aren't very durable.\n\nTake a look at CryoCards https://www.cryobit.co/en/\n\nI have a half in CryoCards, the rest in a Armory offline netbook and some change in TREZOR.": 0, "Good question.

Um, I heard you talking about Pay Pal and how you were almost hoping that it would turn into a crypto-currency, so I was wondering what you had to say about bitcoin and, and if you had created bitcoin what you might have done differently to implement it, and if you think that bitcoin does have a future in world-wide currency? "\n\nPETER THIEL\'S ANSWER\n\n"There\'s sort of.. there\'s all these ways how... hu I\'m slightly biased against bitcoin because I didn\'t invent it. I\'d like to have.\n\nUm. So with that, that sort of ah that, that qualifier, I think that um, you know, I think uh, there is a way in which bitcoin sort of achieved the opposite of ah, Paypal , it has actually succeeded in creating a new currency, at least on the level of speculation, I think ah the, the challenge is going to actually to get the payment system to work so its still, I think very hard to use, there there\'s quite some parts to the cryptographic protocols that uh, its not clear that you ever going to get it to work seamlessly or super fast or at least this I think is a core challenge that uh, that, that needs to be overcome because um, if bitcoin exists only as a currency or as a means to make verified payments for things that are very very illegal, you\'ll go through a lot of hoops to buy uh, you know, drugs or whatever people use it for um, that\'s where you\'re sort of set up for the government shutting it down so, so I, I would be more bullish if I saw the amount of legal payments uh, going up more, more quickly than it is, um. \n\nYou know, the, ah I, I keep wondering whether it will just get shut down by the government at some point. You know I\'m, I\'m, I\'m sort, I\'m sort of politically abit libertarian, so I\'m always a bit skeptical of the government ... I think one of the ways our government is quite dysfunctional in this country is that, uh, the fact that it has not shut bitcoin down doesn\'t tell you very much. \n\nIf you had a confident government it would say, this is bad, its illegal, we\'re  going to stop this. Um, and, because it\'s so incompetent, um, you might, you might be under the view that it\'s perfectly fine and people will change their mind seven or eight years later. There was a company on, we encountered back in the Pay pal days called uh, e-gold which had this encrypted, gold linked anonymous certificates and we sort of made Pay pal interoperable with e-gold. It turned out it was all used for fraud, people had stolen credit cards and they used e-gold to launder their receipts into, into untraceable gold. \n\nUm. And so we sort of disconnected from e-gold in summer of 2000, three months after we connected. Uh, we tried to you know, the um, I, there was a press interview I gave in late \'01 where I said it was a sketchy company, uh, they sued me for libel, we settled the libel lawsuit in March of 2000, you know whenever you get sued, you know you never, you never compromise, its like dealing with terrorists, you never, you never, uh, you never negotiate except in every specific instance. Um. And um, and so we, we, we settled uh, we settled the lawsuit earlier to I believe about 6 years later in O-aid, the FBI arrested all the people and they all went to jail.

This is a summary of the video, just a summary, his video is much more nuanced and detailed with dozens of charts and lots of data.\n-----\nConcerned about the dramatic rise in inequality, campaign finance, gridlock of Congress and partisanship over the last 45 years? Well, James' November 2014 study (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gEz__sMVaY) may provide hope. Highlighting Gilens' (Princeton study) data, it has found the most unusual (indeed counterintuitive) source for our current explosion in inequality and campaign financing (1970 to present). D'Angelo found it in a place that surely no economist would look, the secret ballot.\n\nConsidered by many to have crushed the first gilded age, the secret ballot was introduced en masse in the US starting in 1890. By 1940 it was everywhere (all citizens and congressmen voted privately). And then for 30 years life was pretty good. Inequality was dropping, so were a number of other metrics, partisanship, campaign finance etc. And then, October 26th, 1970 there was a crack in our air-tight democracy - The Legislative Reorganization Act of 1970 opened up the votes of Congress (the committee of the whole). Dubbed a \xe2\x80\x99sunshine law\xe2\x80\x99, this bill has only ever been considered a good thing.\n\nThe trouble is, we vote in secret for a reason \xe2\x80\x93 reasons most Americans forget. Every time votes are public we get massive explosion in two types of electoral fraud. The first form of Electoral Fraud is Vote Buying (Tammany Hall, etc), with as much as 20% of the electorate being paid to vote a specific way (often poor individuals being paid with a chicken wing or a beer). The second form is Voter Intimidation, often times people would vote in the local court house, and they would just announce their vote to the local staff. The trouble with voting publicly (stating your votes to a clerk) is that often citizens were voting on deputies and sheriffs who were sitting right there in the court house, listening. It is hard to vote against an evil Sheriff if he can see how you vote. It is easy to see the problem there.\n\nInterestingly, this is exactly what now happens in our Congress. Inside of congress, Voter intimidation leads to massive partisanship and polarization, and the vote buying leads to what some congressmen call \xe2\x80\x98legalized bribery\xe2\x80\x99. The convictions, admissions and stories of this are common (Jack Abramoff, ABACAM, etc etc). And this change in 1970 has led to a feedback loop that responds to the ever increasing money in Washington. Indeed The Legislative Reorganization Act of 1970 is the cause for the phenomenal growth of K-street. And all the big firms were born just months after it passed. The trouble is no one has ever called it what it is, Electoral Fraud. And the beauty is, all these alarming trends can be reversed by re-instating the secret ballot.": 11, 'His video series are amazing. Good luck !': 1, 'It was the MIT Bitcoin Expo held on May 3, 2014.

You want to sell me something, I pay to an address controlled by you, me, and BitProtect.\nYou can see that I paid, but you only get the money once either you and I agree, or you and BitProtect agree. (Or me and bitprotect agree that you tried to rip me off)\n\nSort of like PayPal, except that BitProtect can only vote for one of us to receive to money, but can't access it.\n\nUnfortunately this is not yet very viable due to the volatility, if you ship a physical item the value might fluctuate in the meantime, but you as the merchant probably don't want to take this risk.\n\nThis will only be fixed by time and adoption, but it is technically possible now.\n\n": 2, 'Honestly, as someone who hasn\'t programmed more than website stuff, you lost me at "multisig escrow." I agree it seems like it should be an add on. However, it would be a lot better for me if the process was that I find a merchant that says "accepts bitcoin" and "protected by BitProtect" or something, where BitProtect is an open source insurance add on. Nothing like that exists?': 2, 'No, that\'s not possible. You cannot disallow anybody to own Bitcoin. But you could prevent them from stealing in the first place. Search for some keywords like "multi signature escrow" if you want to learn more. You can organize transactions in special ways, so that neither the buyer nor the seller can access money without consent from the other, for example. If you lock up money from both, nobody has an incentive to trick the other one, cause they both loose money if they don\'t agree on pay or refund. There are great possibilities, and to answer your question: yes, there will be upgrades. They happen all the time. Standards evolve, applications are built, services go live, awesome ideas float all over the place! ': 3, 'The Bitcoin protocol is defined by Bitcoin Core (available at https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin), which certainly does get updates as bugs are fixed and features are added. The only question about any update or new feature is: will it cause a hard or soft fork (see https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/30817/what-is-a-soft-fork)?': 1, "Yes it is, but you don't want it as part of Bitcoin.  It should be an add-on.\n\nThe reason 'unspends' (transaction reversals) are possible with credit cards is because there's a middleman as an arbiter.  If you pay by CC, and you feel you didn't get what you paid for, you can ask your bank to file a chargeback.  There's a dispute process (which is heavily weighted toward the cardholder) and the bank/Visa/merchant's processor deal with it and figure out who keeps the money.  \n\nThis is nice for cardholders, but shitty for merchants, because lots of people file fraudulent chargebacks.  This is a big problem for sellers of online porn, lots of people would rather file a fraud complaint than admit to their spouse/SO that they are paying for cumfuckfatanalsluts.com.  That's a big part of why credit cards take a percentage out of the transaction, to pay for the resources spent dealing with this.\n\nBitcoin of course has no such 'unspend' process.  If it did, then the whole system would be untrustworthy, because (without a 3rd party arbiter) any payment could then be withdrawn later.  If you have no guarantee the money won't evaporate, why would you trust it?  You wouldn't.\n\n-----\n\nThe solution is multisig escrow, which is already possible with the existing protocols.  It works like this.  Let's say A wants to buy something from B for 1BTC.  A doesn't want to give up the money until the product arrives, but B doesn't want to ship product with no guarantee of payment.\n\nSo what you do is get a trusted/neutral 3rd party, and you set up an 'm-of-n' address.  That means that the private key is broken up into 'n' pieces, and you need at least 'm' of them to spend the money.  In this case it's a 2-of-3 key.\n\nSo you have this 2-of-3 wallet.  One piece of the key goes to A (the buyer).  One piece goes to B (the seller).  The 3rd piece goes to a trusted/neutral 3rd party (the arbiter).  Any two of these keys together can be used to spend the money contained in this wallet.  Since two keys are required, neither A nor B can take the money individually.\n\nWhen the transaction begins, A deposits the 1BTC into the m-of-n wallet.  That proves to B that the money exists and it's reserved for the transaction.  B then ships the product.\n\nIf the product arrives and A is happy, then A and B together sign a transaction moving the 1BTC from the m-of-n wallet to B's wallet.  B is paid and everybody walks away.  \nIf the product doesn't work and both A and B agree to a refund, then A and B together sign a transaction moving the 1BTC from the m-of-n wallet back to A's wallet.  A now has the money back, and everybody walks away.  \n**BUT**, if there is a dispute- A wants the money back, but B doesn't want to give it back- that's where C (the arbiter) comes in.  C will listen to the story and decide who is right.  Then either C+A sign a transaction refunding A's money, or C+B sign a transaction completing the payment.
