And they want a share because their service cost them. The cost of their service depends directly on the bandwidth, and utxo size.\n\nNow, introduce LN. Suddenly, miners, exchanges etc... stop being asking their share because your transaction will never stay forever in the shared ledger, it cost them nothing. So LN will ALWAYS be cheapr than on chain transaction only for the fact that storing and transacting through it waste less resources. (the bandwidth and storage you consume with LN is limited to your machine, and do not use space on any other nodes)\nEven now, with LN you would profit from instant transaction and be able to buy your coffee profitably. But if you use LN you\'ll need to pay the establishement of your channel with a btc transaction... which will profit even more from segwit.\n\nTL;DR Bitcoin (on chain) transaction, limit or no limit will cost you a lot if it goes big, because it consumes resources.

So you send that 1.0 coin to an exchange and sell it for $250.    But wait, ... that 1.0 coin was a pre-fork bitcoin.   You should have been able to sell the BTC for $100 as well.   Except when you sent the 1.0 coin to the exchange, the transaction would confirm on both chains -- essentially you sent the exchange $350 worth of value, but got only $250.  \n\nTo protect against this happening you could skillfully taint your coin with newly mined ClassicCoin.

": 0, 'Uh. Why wait that long? I\'ll happily respond now:\n\nWe\'ve had something more efficient (no round-trips at all) designed, implemented, and deployed almost universally for over a year: Matt\'s [fast block relay protocol](https://github.com/TheBlueMatt/RelayNode).\n\nYou can see stats off the nodes that Matt runs which speak it: http://bitcoinrelaynetwork.org/stats.html\n\nWithout it, there would probably be only a single mining pool now. This was created to fight back the rapidly rising centralization encouraged by high orphaning by blocks going over 500k or so. Sadly it\'s not magic pixie dust.\n\nI think that it\'s sad that so many here were apparently unaware of it (and often go on to propose less efficient schemes...) but I guess thats what happens to those that don\'t employ a shill army to go crow about every little advance.\n\nMoreover, even the "Future Strategies" like "Datastream compression" were [already implemented](https://github.com/TheBlueMatt/RelayNode/commit/2915aacecdd8be6797d3eff81b4192332f0c1551) by Matt, and backed out of the design when they were found to not be helpful for minimizing latency in practice.': 3, "I see many benefits in having it external:\n\nIt is functionality (block latency minimization) that is only interesting to less than 1% of the Bitcoin network. Dumping it all in one protocol increases complexity and attack surface.\n\n(Network bandwidth minimization is interesting to more parties but would be done best via other approaches-- e.g. set reconciliation against txid with many round trips, especially because for a node with many connections block relay improvments only provides a 10% reduction at most.. minimizing bandwidth requires improving on how transaction rumoring works)\n\nRunning all of the bitcoin p2p over a single protocol creates an unnecessary monoculture; a DOS attack on one protocol could knock out the whole network. The existence of p2p protocol diversity can form parallel paths to communicate the blockchain.  In core we've been asking people to create parallel p2p protocols for years.\n\nCramming the functionality into the legacy bitcoin protocol also slaves it's development pace to that of bitcoin client software. By keeping it external it's possible to upgrade the protocol much faster and learn at an accelerated pace.  An example of this was that Matt deployed LZMA compression in the protocol last year, found that in the real world it harmed propagation latency and rolled it back-- all faster than even a bitcoin implementation release.\n\nIn the long run, as the protocols stabilize, mature, and reach optimal performance it may make a lot of sense to bundle it in-- not necessarily in the single legacy p2p protocol but as a protocol supported in parallel.  But I think that it's far from clear that we've reached that point yet.  The benefit here is primarily one of ease of deployment; though in the particular case of mining, there are already many pieces of software that must be deployed outside of bitcoin core.

We assume that because a good is scarce it is costly enough to produce such that a free market won\'t oversupply it, driving its price to zero.

The aim is to prevent the split of community, seek common ground while reserving differences. Core has said that a scaling without consensus is too risky. We will give them the consensus. If the consensus is reached, btc market will be more stable, and in the meantime, future efforts will be more practical.\n\n**Here in this meeting we, the attendees, all agree the following plan**\n\n* When blocks are full, and at that time, \n\n* if Core has not yet upgraded to 2MB, \n\n* and if Classic is not enough widely supported, \n\n* We will do what Satoshi has pointed out https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1347.msg15366#msg15366 \nWe will add a code patch to increase the cap from 1MB to 2MB to solve the pressing problem.\nThis means, as we think, has a big potential to reach consensus, and urge Core to accommodate.\n\n\n**[Risks in Segwit]**\n\nCore\xe2\x80\x99s Segwit plan will indirectly expand block size, but not without risk.\n\nFirstly, Segwit has only 1.6MB theoretical effect. There\xe2\x80\x99s considerable complexity in code development, which would make other applications difficult to upgrade, or even unwilling to upgrade. If only 50% tx adopts Segwit, the 6-12 months hard work will only achieve 1.3MB effect, which is more or less meaningless.\n\nSecondly, Segwit has large modification in bitcoin low-level logic. While the workload is huge, the community is exerting great pressure. The core team has to work overtime to deliver it in time. \n\nBitmain CEO Mr. WU Jihan also confirmed that "There are Core devs working more than ten hours a day and try to get the work done faster."\n\nMany of us here has tech background. We know what overtime often means to quality.\nThe history of bitcoin is not absent of bugs. As indicated here https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures .For instance a hacker exploited bitcoin vulnerability to produce 184.4 billion bitcoins in 2010-08-15 http://8btc.com/thread-23642-1-1.html.\n\nCurrently our bitcoin is stable and solid. This is a joint hard work of six years. If we push to produce segwit, the risk is too large. We may suffer grievous loss. Bitcoin price may even go down with one order of magnitude. Which is enough to kill the future. \n\nSo we think it\xe2\x80\x99s vital to prevent core from hastily delivering Segwit.\n\n**[Support Now]**\n\nWe will do our best to ask all bitcoin companies / users to join us. \nPlease reply in this thread to help.\n\n**[Supplementary]**\n\n- Why is 90% a consensused hash ratio?\n\n- Because some hash power is not in mining pools (solo mining or in private pools), which means they cannot express their voice. We subtract this silent portion, and get an actual 95% of total public hash, which means a consensus.\n\n**[EOF]**\n\n*Edit: Added explaination of the Nine-Two title; A minor fix of translation; Translated the Supplementary part which was added later by the author.*\n\n*If you liked it, consider buy me a dumpling :) 1FRSRsdjTfh6S47YfzPtJZ6Qr9bBaUyJnu': 53}, ('How does breadwallet work?', 5): {"The wallet will handle that for you.

Some benchmark is usually specified, such as the S&P 500 or the world stock market, and we measure how sensitive the asset is to movements in the "market". For example, if the S&P drops 10% and an asset in question plummets 30%, this asset is "risky" and we say the "beta" is approximately 3.0. This asset should also have a high expected return (low price) to compensate people for bearing such risk.\n\nYou can use this model for any asset return. For example, you could look at any FX rate or bond return. Bitcoin can be considered in the FX category.\n\nTo use  the CAPM, first specify the benchmark (suppose we use the MSCI World Market), and then sample bitcoin prices (from a liquid exchange) say around 5pm ET. Calculate the bitcoin returns. You could also look at a basket of exchanges (and average the prices). If we had a long enough history for an ETF, that would work too. It is easy to grab prices from Bloomberg or TR Eikon (as well as many other websites that offer historical BTC data). \n\nWhat you will find (and I have not done this exercise but I strongly suspect it is true), that there is no correlation (beta=0) between bitcoin returns and any benchmark.  \n\nDoes this make sense? Yes. Bitcoin is not dependent on any monetary policy or fiscal policy other than its algorithmic rule. Hence, the "risk" in the sense of the CAPM, is low -- and so is the expected return. \n\nLet me make two further remarks. First, you might argue that the correlation could be negative. If there was a highly negative economic event whereby people lost (more) trust in monetary authorities, equities might crash but bitcoin could appreciate in value. This is another way of saying - the correlation you see in the past might not repeat in the future. Second, the CAPM is a very simple model -- it says there is only one source of risk. There are other models with multidimensional risk.\n\nFinally, a natural question is: "how can he say bitcoin has low risk when bitcoin volatility is over 100% per year -- many times more volatile than equities?"\n\nIt has to do with the way that you define risk. The key insight of the CAPM (which won Bill Sharpe a Nobel Prize in 1992) is that pure volatility (standard deviation of returns) is not rewarded because you can diversify much of that risk away. For example, if someone\'s portfolio consisted of a single stock, XYZ, that would be a very volatile portfolio (perhaps many times more volatile than the market) -- and you would not be rewarded for bearing that risk. Even adding just one or two more stocks, dramatically reduces the volatility of the portfolio.  People have (or should have) diversified portfolios. What really counts is whether the asset increases the risk of your diversified portfolio. Bitcoin is uncorrelated with other assets. Hence, it does not necessarily increase the risk -- though on it own, it is highly risky. This is a subtle but important point.': 3, 'Great post, thanks!': 0, "You can define your market in any way you want. If you're a currency trader, then you should compare it to an index of currencies.

You should also include groups like private equity and commodities, and weight appropriately. \n\nSo you have your risk free rate, the expected value, volatility, and now a market index.
