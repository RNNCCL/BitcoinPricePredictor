Before that combo, portable players were buggy, clunky, poorly interfaced and with virtually no good software support. It just took a company that understood how to make it easy, to make it popular.\n\nFor instance, you could design a piece of software for the home computer that acts as an ATM of sorts, or a "vault" which is incapable of sending to any addresses that are not on a device that is synced to it via USB cable. It keeps a record of the addresses on your synced device and will ONLY send to those addresses. The user then never even needs to see the addresses or anything, it just says "Send to John Doe\'s mobile wallet" and an amount...click send, and boom, there it is in your companion phone wallet.

What I meant was that were we to have named accounts in our asset reserve-- these dollars, gold, euros, etc. belong to Elan-- then we'd likely eventually be regulated as a bank. What we do is something very different--virtual assets backed by a full reserve with real-time transparency (more buzz words, oh no!).  A full reserve married to cloud-based assets is not a financial model that fits comfortably into existing regulatory regimes. And, yes, running a full reserve means we reallocate assets in our reserve to reflect changes in our aggregate obligations to our members. I'll also have to explain better what our real-time transparency means and why it indeed would have prevented (or at least alerted stakeholders) to a Gox, Stamp, Bank blow-ups by disclosing the solvency, liquidity, and in the case of banks liability/asset risk mismatch.

Whether its by governments or thugs, or a government of thugs.  Centralizing a system in one place puts all your customers at risk, and I say needlessly.\n\nAt the end of the day we still havn't got a reason why a decentralized system couldn't do what your doing.

": 2, 'Sharky-- you are correct that there\'s always the risk that BR will get hacked, that our security measures, no matter how well-considered and implemented, will fail. But the real danger posed to consumers by financial services from Gox to the banks that all failed in 2008 isn\'t the risk of hackers or failures of security or internal controls, it\'s the lack of transparency that allows undisclosed risk to build up in a system. If Gox had been as transparent as BR, everyone would have been able to see in real-time what was going on-- that hackers were stealing coin or that Karpeles was buying coin with client funds or whatever else was going on. Centralized financial systems offer huge consumer benefits, but until BR\'s real-time transparency those benefits have come at an enormous cost, one that almost brought down the world\'s financial system. If banks were as transparent as BR, we\'d all be able to judge the risk they were taking with our money and then we could pull our money out or leave it in as befit our risk appetite. Security/hackers aren\'t the biggest risk to global finance, undisclosed risk is, and real-time transparency is the solution.\n\n It\'s true that holding your own bitcoin or using Coinbase vault removes the risk posed by a centralized service like BR that is designed to make moving value instant and free. It would not be difficult for us to add a "vault" card to our dashboard, but our goal isn\'t to help bitcoiners vault their bitcoin. Our mission is to change money fundamentally so that holding and moving money is instant and free and so that every networked device is an access point to basic financial services. Our goal is to raise the bar for financial stewardship worldwide with real-time transparency.\n\nThere are many, many, many important problems that need to be solved to help the poorest and most vulnerable people in the world. Those are the ones BR is committed to solving. Vaulting bitcoin solves none of them, though I can totally understand why you\'d prefer to sock your bitcoin away in a vault. If you want to use those bitcoin for commerce, however, BR is where you\'ll want to move them.\n\nThanks for joining our Series B.

The term "implied assertion of objectively verifiable" fact is derived from a 1990 Supreme Court case determining when a person\'s speech may be tried before a jury as defamatory.  \n\nPrior to this case courts tended to categorize all speech through an "artificial dichotomy," as either fact or opinion, with only the former being actionable and the latter being protected.  However, the Court noted that there is hardly a difference between the statement "John is a liar," and "in my opinion John is a liar."  Although one is couched as opinion, both are objectively verifiable assertions.  Thus both statements create a liability to the speaker, if objectively verified to be false.\n\nTo objectively verify means to determine whether true or false.  The process for doing this is a trial before the fact-finder (a jury, unless waived, in a defamation action).  So if the court finds a statement "objectively verifiable" it is not finding it to be true or false, it is finding it to be verifiable as either true or false.\n\nThe implied assertion that drug dealers aren\'t trustworthy is as objectively verifiable as that implied from "no one trusts Dave."  The Court would acknowledge that the extreme language was not meant to be taken literally, but the implication that Dave is dishonest is objectively verifiable and therefore a question for a jury to reasonably determine whether true or false.\n\nIn this case the question for the jury should be "Are drug dealers generally thought trustworthy?"  No honest and reasonable person would expect a jury to determine that drug dealers are a generally trustworthy group.\n\nWhen I said it was objectively verifiable, I meant what I said bossman.  It\'s something a jury could determine whether true or false, not something that has already been determined.  If I meant to say otherwise I would have said "objectively verified."\n\nOn my own, however, I also assert that it is obviously true;  so true that no one would waste money arguing otherwise in Court.  Not even a legal weed dealer would try to seek redress over a statement like this, no matter how much business it costs them.  She would lose.': 0, 'Still waiting for that objective verification, kiddo.': -2, 'Drug dealers are not noted for being particularly trustworthy people.': -7, "> No group is known for being particularly trustworthy.\n\nTherefore drug dealers are not noted for being trustworthy.\n\nBut this doesn't really cut to the issue though.

I only made the statement to help your dumbass out in the argument.  There is obviously nothing literally false about the author\xe2\x80\x99s statement that "drug dealers are not noted for being particularly trustworthy."  You yourself even said:\n\n> I can\'t think of a single class of people who are "noted for being particularly trustworthy people". \n\n>No group is known for being particularly trustworthy.\n\nSo then that begs the question:  What is your problem then, with the journalist saying drug dealers aren\xe2\x80\x99t noted as trustworthy?\n\nRather than require you to strain your tiny drug-harmed brain to articulate an answer, and being a generous and intellectually honest fellow who knows that the matter has already been settled by the very relevant Supreme Court of the United States, I assisted you:\n\n> The author was only somewhat euphemistically saying that they aren\'t noted as trustworthy. He was actually making an implied assertion of objectively verifiable fact that drug dealers are generally thought to be even less trustworthy characters than other societal groups.\n\nSo even though what the author said is technically true, I know you really want to argue about what he implied.  So rather than make you prove what he implied, I conceded it.  You\xe2\x80\x99re welcome.  I helped you cut to the issue that your problem with the author\xe2\x80\x99s statement is not whether it is true or not, but rather whether its implications are true.  Most don\xe2\x80\x99t realize that implications are actionable in Court, and many more would never even concede to argue over implications without you first proving the implications.  I, on the other hand, know that implications are and should be actionable if they are assertions of objectively verifiable fact, which is how a Court would classify what the author was implying.  So being a nice guy, I conceded that the author was asserting:\n\n> drug dealers are generally thought to be even less trustworthy characters than other societal groups.\n\nFurther inferences can be drawn that maybe he intended to say that they should not be trusted within society.  Who knows?\n\nGenerously, I allowed you to skip all that hard work of getting to your point and instead just took you right where you wanted to go\xe2\x80\x94that the author\xe2\x80\x99s implication was unfair (again you\xe2\x80\x99re welcome).\n\nThen I stated my opposing point so that you could attack it with your logic, which is:  You\xe2\x80\x99re a dumbass to argue the merit of trusting anonymous online carding drug dealers.  Anonymous online carding drug dealers should never be trusted with significant funds.  This is a great path to losing significant money.\n\nThen came the humor.
