You can use them whether your ledger is a blockchain or a centralized database ledger. Pretty much all older concepts of e-cash use cryptographically signed transactions - the innovation with Bitcoin was using them in conjunction with the blockchain.\n\nIf centralized processors copy something from Bitcoin, it\'d be the cryptographically signed transactions aspect of it, but that tech has been around for decades, and it\'s not what set Bitcoin apart from all the previous attempts.

They wouldn't want to be subject to the current volatility, though, so they would basically create their own alt-coin that is fixed at a 1:1 ratio with the dollar, and transact that way.\n\nThat is what most of us mean when we say that the blockchain has promise, but it may not necessarily increase bitcoin's value.": 1, 'Exactly. Which is why the most secure blockchain is the one secured by the most valuable coin. \n\nThis is also true for PoS systems. ': 3, ">Likewise PoW. \n\nNo, because the market cap ultimately provides the security for PoW coins, so that if you had a coin with a $100,000 market cap, no matter what percentage of the hashing power was controlled by non-malicious actors, the coin would be profoundly insecure because of that coin's relative hashing power compared to its outside competitors (a competitor coin with a $2,000,000,000 market cap would have far more hashing power behind it), and the potential hashing power of the outside world in general. The proportional ownership of hashing power mining the coin doesn't provide any additional security from outside threats, the only thing that matters is how much hashing power the coin has compared to what the outside world has, since at any time the outside world can bring their hashing power to bare. It is always better to have more decentralization in PoW because decentralization provides security from inside threats, so to speak. So you want both decentralization and large market cap in PoW systems.\n \nLet's say you wanted to start a new coin to represent shares in your company. If you made a PoW coin, you would have to essentially pray that no malicious entity would attack your network. Prayer isn't exactly good security. On the other hand, if you created a PoS system and gave yourself 51% of the shares, then your system is effectively as safe as any, no outside attackers are a threat (as long as you aren't willing to sell).

This automatically creates a problem for people who think government or some other central authority should pay for social programs, warfare, etc. That can't be done with a deflationary currency without everyone who owns some of the currency chipping into the effort voluntarily. Inflationary currencies on the other hand don't really have that problem because the currency can be endlessly divided.  Add that to fiat where a government says 1 dollar equals 1 dollar by law and the division of the currency doesn't mean much (at first). \n\nThe blockchain (Bitcoin big b) can and has been forked hundreds of times already and some of those forks have created inflationary (no hard limit) cryptos with varying forms of centralization/decentralization (proof of stake, dpos, etc).  So I think when people say little b bitcoin is bad I think on some level they disagree with its inability to inflate. Also possibly the centralization issue but I think the inflation one is more fundamental than that in this case. \n\nEdit- at work so I didn't watch the youtube video you linked so I may not be in the ballpark. apologies if that's the case": 1, '>I\'m not saying there wouldn\'t be a unit of account, it just wouldn\'t be bitcoins. Prob something like "crypto fiat" but on their own blockchain.\n\nThat\'s called an altcoin. There are hundreds of them. There are broadly two types of coins, ones that use hardware to secure the block chain, and ones that use software. \n\nOf the ones that use hardware, like Bitcoin, there can only be a few that survive long term, in my opinion. The reason for this is, put simply, because all the coins compete over the same limited mining resources. So if one coin is dramatically ahead of the rest, the other coins can\'t catch up and compete and permanently lack security (and a coin without security is never going to be worth much). So when people say, "it is about the block chain" they really aren\'t talking about making a direct copy of Bitcoin, because that won\'t work. For hardware backed block chains, the strength of the network, the security of the network, is proportional to the market cap. \n\nWhat they are usually talking about is securing the block chain using software, rather than mining hardware. The reason this holds a lot of promise is that software backed block chains don\'t compete with one another over limited resources. Their security is, in a sense, more internal to the system. They have a profound difference, however, which is that they can be eventually be permanently controlled by a single entity, this is because whoever controls the majority units of account owns the block chain. Hardware backed block chains like Bitcoin can be temporarily controlled by a single entity, because whoever owns the majority hashing power (mining) controls the block chain, but this control can be wrestled from them at any time by other people just getting more hashing power. (Hopefully Bitcoin will be improved further to make it extremely difficult for this kind of mining centralization.) Software backed block chains lead to permanent control that can only be given up voluntarily, since the person with majority units of account would have to sell. This is actually a real benefit in certain circumstances. For instance, if you created a software backed block chain to create a autonomous corporation. To secure the block chain from outside threats you would only need issue yourself the majority stock, a malicious attacker could only gain 51% control of the block chain by buying up your stock, which you wouldn\'t sell. This kind of security using a block chain couldn\'t be accomplished using the system Bitcoin uses. Whoever owns the majority shares of the company, would essentially also potentially own the block chain itself. So it is centralized, but much more fluid and profound than traditional companies. Owning majority shares wouldn\'t just give you legal control, it would give you actual control over the company. I\'ll leave it to your imagination to think of the implications of this. \n\nBut I don\'t see how this could work for a currency, because the last thing you would want is the block chain to be permanently owned by a single entity. (Furthermore, you have a potentially unlimited number of these software based block chains, making them less scarce and harder to maintain as a currency short of government enforcement like fiat.) So when people talk about "it is not bitcoin, it is the block chain" I don\'t think they are talking about money, they are talking about all the other financial possibilities behind block chain tech. But raw money, money will always be Bitcoin imho, at least m0 money.  \n\nBitcoin goes through phases, with each phase some new issue becomes the focus of why Bitcoin is flawed. The previous phase was concerned with Bitcoin\'s lack of strong anonymity. The current phase is concerned with mining centralization, and started with the 51% ghash.io crisis earlier this year. With this concern software backed block chains started to be taken very seriously and has lead to this current atmosphere of doubt about Bitcoin\'s future against these competitors. I don\'t see them as competitors, but most people do. The day Peter Todd says software block chains are superior, maybe I\'ll change my mind. But I think people like Peter Todd have the longer vision and a purity of intention and spirit that I agree with. I believe Bitcoin is going to come through this period even stronger and you will have the rise of the appcoins, which are coins that exist on top of the Bitcoin block chain and use it for their own purposes (like bacteria living on your skin) growing in popularity. \n\nBTW, love your videos!\n\n': 2, "You have to ask yourself what a blockchain offers over a traditional database.\n\nIf any single bank (or industry group, e.g. SWIFT) has actual control over the blockchain (let's say, the ability to reverse or block transactions), then you're creating a very expensive data structure when a database would work much more efficiently. Databases can still be distributed and synchronised over multiple servers, multiple locations etc.\n\nIf any central party has control there is no need to solve the Byzantine Generals problem, no need for proof of work/mining etc.\n\nWhat Bitcoin is giving us is a ledger which cannot be retroactively edited by *any* party at all - whereas a bank's or central bank's ledger only ensures no malicious editing by anyone *except* that bank.
