One user could theoretically be linked to many, many addresses for redemption on the Bitcoin blockchain depending on how many different people sent them money.

The idea appeared in 2012.\n2. The first protocol implemented in 2012 was called OBC.\n3. In 2013 we found that this protocol has several drawbacks and started designing other protocols.\n4. In 2014 there were several groups working on colored coins, and each of them created a different protocol.\n\nThis fragmentation happened for several reasons: 1) people disagreed about features and didn\'t want to compromise; 2) each group wanted to commercialize it, so fast development was the priority.\n\nSo we ended up with three main protocol in 2014 (although quite possibly there are several more experimental or specialized ones):\n\n1. EPOBC was implemented in NGCCC project, later known as ChromaWallet.\n2. OpenAssets was implemented by CoinPrism.\n3. CoinSpark.\n\nEach protocol has its own advantages/disadvantages, but the idea is largely the same. They are all incompatible with each other.\n\nSo now in 2015 we have these three, and also Colu, which claims to have developed "the colored coins standard", but doesn\'t show it to anyone (wtf, Colu?).\n\nIn principle, colored coin wallets can implement more than one protocol. For example, ChromaWallet now has OBC and EPOBC and we can add any kind of a colored coin protocol. We considered adding OpenAssets, it\'s not hard on the tech level, but since we [do not like it](https://github.com/bitcoinx/colored-coin-tools/wiki/OpenAssets-deficiencies), it\'s not a priority, so to speak.

Those 90 BTC would have to be provided by Coinbase.  Both merchants and customers would have to trust Coinbase to properly relay payments, and not swallow them.\n\nIf that is how it is going to work, then LN is bullshit.  Obviously I must be missing some important detail.  So, how would that example work, actually?\n\nIf you prefer, assume 200'000 customers, each considering to spend up to 10 BTC over the next month, scattered over 300 merchants.  Will Coinbase have to borrow 600 million BTC in order to open 300 channels to the merchants, with 2 million BTC locked in each channel?": 0, "That is a strawman premise. You're not fooling anyone. Bitcoin started with one miner and one pizza guy. It grew. Your 3 man scenario is sophomoric.": 1, 'I am trying to work out the example myself, since no one is willing to try.\n\nIt seems reasonable to assume that each channel will be open for 1 week, on the average. So, each week, each customer must pay the fee F for 2 transactions on the blokchain, to open and to close his channel to the hub. He must also pay some fee X with each (off-chain) purchase, to pay for the hub\'s overhead.\n\nAnyone dares to guess the values of F and X?  (Someone estimated F = 100 USD, which would make the LN a bad joke. Even assuming F = 0.50 USD, that is 52 USD/year per customer.  That must be more than the public health budget of many african villages...)\n\nWith 7 million users and 1 new channel created per week per user, the LN would generate 2 million blockchain transctions per day, or 3 times the current capacity.\n\nThe outgoing channels must be created by request from each merchant to the hub. Each merchant should pay 2 F to open those channels.  Since the fees will be actually paid by the hub, they may be discounted from the first payments that the merchant would receive; unless each merchant also opens a channels to the hub, paying another 2 F of fees, and sends a "check" for 2 F throug it .\n\nA customer\'s total week\'s budget wil be locked up for the whole week, unless the customer decides that he does not want to make any more purchases and asks the hub to close the channel, and the hub complies timely.  \n\nThe hub has to borrow a lot of bitcoins in order to open the channels to the merchants, usually more than what the customers have locked in their channels. The hub must open the output channel to a merchant before the *first* customer pays to it; but other customers may only open their channels after that time.  So the hub cannot estimate how much it has to lock for each merchant.  It may have to lock a small amount and periodically open more channels (or raise its ceiling) as those are saturated.  \n\nIf a customer receives an extra amount of BTC during the week, from a non-LN source, and wants to add it to his spending budget, he must spend another 2 F in blockchain fees, and either open another channel to the hub, which may require him to split payments through both channels; or request the closing of the channel,wait for the hub to do that, then reopen the channel with the total amount.  Likewise if a customer wants to pay some non-LN merchant from the remainder of his week\'s budget.  \n\nIf merchant wants to pay some non-LN supplier with coins from the payments he received so far, he must close his channel and ask the hub to reopen it.  Since no customer can send him payments while his channel is closed, he may want to open that second channel in advance. Either way that second channel costs another 2 F to the merchant.\n\nBecause of these last two considerations, the LN will be useful only if almost all the bitcoin traffic goes through it.  If only 70% of the users are on the LN, then only ~50% of the traffic will be between two LN users, and ~40% of the traffic will be between an LN user and a non-LN user.  The latter will be multiplied by 3 because of the need to break and recreate the LN channels.  So, with 70% of the users in the LN, the total traffic on the blockchain would in fact be ~30% *higher* than if there was no LN, even without counting the weekly channel reopenings of the LN.

Proving `curve.n - x` is small using the existing method would not prove that `x` is big enough.

Whilst Bitcoin has many advantages over credit card payments, for most people the barriers to entry are high enough to keep them on their existing payment solutions. If we create a new market or application that is highly compelling and requires Bitcoin, then we give people a stronger incentive to acquire some. And once they\'ve made the decision to get some coins for that killer app, why not get a little bit more than needed and also use it to buy other things later? To make a killer app we need things Bitcoin can do that other systems can\'t. Micropayments is an obvious example.\n\n>The second reason this work is important is that our community hasn\'t been making good use of the contracts features Satoshi left for us. Despite that many designs were documented years ago (by me on the Contracts page), there haven\'t really been any apps that use them. "Where are the contract apps?" is a question that came up a lot when I was in California for the conference. The cause seems to be that it\'s hard to understand how to turn the high level descriptions on the wiki into working code. The micropayment channels code in bitcoinj now gives us a worked example from beginning to end - you can read the theory, read the protocol description and then see it how to translate it into a real, working system that manages all the fiddly details.

This model is a *natural fit* for bitcoin and it annoys me to no end that the core devs are not focusing on this at all because it is a self-evident decentralized solution!\n\nPruning Nodes can and would act exactly like a "repository" in this model. They don\'t have the whole blockchain; just the most important or relevant data (which is agreed to be the last 2 days of blocks, plus the UTXO set or perhaps a "likely subset"). This is *all* a pruning node needs; it doesn\'t (nor should it) require a wallet or miner. A pruning node can serve as a "local gateway" for a merchant or provider by performing the basic security service of the protocol for local transactions.\n\nFull Nodes act as the "authority" in this model. They maintain the entire blockchain and will provide to any client, on demand, all necessary information to independently verify any and all data on the blockchain. A full node would probably be a requirement for a miner, but wouldn\'t make sense for a user or merchant.\n\nIn this model, your SPV wallet acts like a browser; it executes a lookup request to the protocol, which then retrieves the data from a local or preferred pruning node, which in turn places and relays the results of data requests for any information the pruning node didn\'t have on hand.\n\nDoes this solve the blocksize problem? NO! But it does offer a way to protect end users from it by offering a distinct userspace layer to the protocol upon which solutions are more easily built and deployed. After all, an SPV client doesn\'t need to know the maximum block size, and an authoritative full node doesn\'t need to index a wallet.

Your real IP should never hit the Blockchain, that is the easiest way for companies to build a history profile.\n\n- Vary your accounts, use different services and paper wallets above all to hold bitcoin you aren\'t using. \n\nI\'ve been a part of bitcoin for the past 3 years, none of my transactions are linked to one another. To the Blockchain, all my wallets are seen as separate entities. Yet I have a record of all my transactions encrypted on an offline storage if I need to pull up certain information.

Bitcoin is a platform meant to empower individuals and that\'s just what it has done for me.\n\n\nI only have one question for this subreddit and thread, and it is one of taint. Since bitcoins are constantly being mixed, how many hops/mixes does it take for the money to be "untainted" or unrelated? For the US dollar it is easy, as soon as you exchange a bill that money is clean. However, with bitcoin, if you are receiving bitcoins from someone who got them through nefarious means, you are the one being implicated. \n\nServices like Coinbase trace this to an extent to stop gamblers from unloading money off.

Inputs and outputs, there's a version and some bits that tell you how many inputs/outputs there are and a lock time. Forget lock time for now.\n\nEvery Input is a previous Output. Sounds weird, right?\n\nWhen bitcoin are mined the Input of the transaction is usually blank, it can be anything, but usually it is blank. This is called the Coinbase. The Output for the Coinbase transaction is the block reward + unspent tx inputs. I can include as many outputs in my transaction as I have bitcoin in my inputs. Theoretically. \n\nIn fact, 99.9% of transactions do this. Whenever you send someone coins you likely include multiple outputs - change outputs are the most common. E.g. you send me 1 bitcoin but previously received .5 and .75 bitcoin. Your transaction must combine those inputs for a total of 1.25 bitcoin. You tx will have two outputs: 1 to my address and ~.25 to an address your wallet will generate and you control. In this way, you give yourself change.\n\nThe only limit are size constraints and available bitcoin from your inputs. So, theoretically, 1 input could have thousands of outputs. \n\nHowever, each output would take about 'many bytes.' Back of the napkin, let's say each output is 100 bytes. Most of it is in the Script. An output script is a Turing incomplete 'code' that has the requirements for unlocking the bitcoin - i.e. using them as inputs in a future transaction. So since outputs have a physical byte size they are also constrained by the size of the blocks. Also, that a large transaction will likely be refused by the miners.\n\nSecond part,\n\nBitcoin can handle many thousands of tx per second. The 7 TPS theoretical speed comes from a basic transaction being ~215 bytes (Actually larger) but each block is about 1MiB (really 750 kb). 1 MiB / 215 bytes = 4,878 transactions. The average block time is ten minutes.\n\n4878 / 600 seconds = about 8.\n\nLike I said, txs are not that small and the miners usually set the block size to around 750KiB\n\n3658 / 600 = 6.09 tx per second. \n\nWe can broadcast many, many more txs at a much faster rate - it happens, actually. The 7Tps thing is sustained. Even if it goes higher, miners have an in-memory pool where they keep transactions. If a miner does not include a tx in a block it remains in the pool. If we did, says, 9 tx per second at the theoretical 215 tx size for ten minutes the next block would likely contain the last 1/3 of those tx that were broadcast before the previous block were mined. They would stay at 0 confirmations during this time. \n\nTo get rid of that tx you would have to mine a different transaction to a block that uses the same inputs - thus voiding the first tx in the pool (This is a known attack called a block witholding attack) or turn off every node running on the network that has a copy of that tx.

Yes, it is Armageddon, they say, but they go on to state that there is life after Armageddon and much of their work is devoted to suggesting fixes of one sort or another that they claim would alleviate or solve some of the problems posed by game-playing mining pools. We would claim that our conclusion is the simplest and most natural one, however, and that their fixes, if adopted, would only delay the inevitable and may not be adopted anyway. In fact, there has been a great deal of discussion on the blogosphere about the large mining pool problem. Most proposed solutions boil down to encouraging decentralization, a good example being the \xe2\x80\x9cgetblocktemplate\xe2\x80\x9d mining protocol developed over mid 2012, the essence of which is to move block creation from the pool operator to the individual miner. We cannot even attempt here to provide any analysis of these proposals, other than to repeat our view that these are at best palliatives that may ameliorate but do not root out the underlying problems posed by centralizing tendencies in the Bitcoin system. We would also add that our message that Bitcoin will bite the dust has received a mixed but mostly negative response from the Bitcoin community.\n378\nbitcoin players would be immune to the same human failings as central bankers.\nOur best guess is that in the short term there will continue to be a drip-by-drip erosion of confidence as the realization grows that the system is compromised.

One of the things that\'s very different about bitcoin compared to prior forms of money is needing a basic working knowledge of cryptography, something which is very useful in today\'s world but is relatively uncommon.\n\nThus I\'m going to try to make a very simple introduction to cryptography in general, as the other answers have addressed the bitcoin-specific points in detail.\n\n"Public-key cryptography" is a form of cryptography (mathematical ways of exchanging messages securely, essentially) wherein there are two keys used, a "public" and a "private" key. The public key can be published to the world. The private key is your secret which allows you to "sign" messages and prove that they came from "you" (actually, that they came from someone who had the private key to that public key), or for someone else to send a message which only "you" can read (similarly, only someone with the private key to that public key).\n\nThe underlying math which makes this all work is quite complex and makes my head hurt. Fortunately, other people take care of all those details and we just trust them (this is not a mathematical proof, but in practice, this is how most of us live).\n\n---\n\nNow, going back to bitcoin applications. The other answers covered this well; I\'ll try not to be too repetitive. The public key is converted to the address that you\'re used to seeing (it\'s a hash, which is sort of like a barcode in being a short-hand way to refer to a particular thing). The private key is stored in your wallet.dat.\n\nYou can re-use your existing addresses. The question of whether you *should* or not is somewhat open. In short, it is probably the best security to use a different address for each thing you do, while it can be more convenient to re-use an address. If you re-use addresses, it will be easier for someone to identify you, although you should be aware that may be possible anyhow, in particular without knowing the system in detail (for instance, even if you use new addresses all the time, when you go to spend, your wallet may choose to combine whichever of those it finds most convenient, which could reveal your identity by linking addresses; there is not currently a user-friendly way to deal with this (known as \'coin control\') as far as I know).\n\nI hope that helps!': 1, "AFAIK, there have been no reported examples. Copay would be another wallet to try this on.\n\nIn principle, there's nothing special you'd be asking for. The wallet still needs to sign a partially-signed transaction.

For various reasons, they tend to attach metadata to the transaction.

And if you change the code, you can do this within the law, or you can end up breaking the law.\n\nFor 99.99% of the changes that break the law the request to do it anyway will be a clear NO. For instance the change of the total amount of coins that there will ever be.\nFor others its not so clear, and it takes a lot of research what is the best way to go forward if a law-change were to be made.

They both do the same things: move in compliance with the rules and validate if everyone else is doing the same, but the police will also validate everyone joining this road to see if they are in compliance with the rules that exist for the road; whether they are aware of the speed limit.\n\nIt follows, that if the police all of the sudden will only allow for people who believe the speed limit is, say, 90 km/h rather than the current 130 km/h, on this road, that this will be the de-facto speed limit that exists for the road. The rule which says the speed limit must be *below* 130 km/h, enforced by people, is satisfied regardless. This is known as a **soft fork**, it *restricts existing rules* further, and it can be enforced by miners only.\n\nIf the police / miners want to *increase* the speed limit to, say, 150 km/h, then they can certainly try. But in order for this to work then all people / nodes that participate on the road must also agree with this *new* rule which *expands* the scope it encompassed originally. A speed of 150 km/h *does not* satisfy the original speed limit rule of 130 km/h. This is known as a **hard fork**, it *expands existing rules*, and it requires all participants to be in agreement of the new rules.\n\n----\n\nChanges to the codebase which require nothing are changes which change no rule, only the way in which they are implemented.

The value space of this number is so large that given proper randomness it's impossible for 2 people to ever generate the same number; it will be unique.\n\nOut of a private key a public key will be computed through ECDSA (specifically in bitcoin: secp256k1), which is a digital signature algorithm. ECDSA defines a curve on a surface, you can think of the private key as a point on this curve, and the public key as another point on the curve with a special relation to the private key. The public key can be computed/derived out of the private key, but the public key *cannot* feasibly be reversed to the private key.\n\nBecause some mathematical properties of the curve, and the private and public key points on this curve, it's possible to do some special things: You can *prove you own* the private key, without ever showing someone the private key, by exposing the public key to the public. By 'signing' some data with you private key (which remains secret), someone else can verify that your signature is valid by using your public key.\n\nAn address is a *hash* of your public key. A hashing algorithm (specifically in bitcoin: SHA256 and RIPE-MD) is an algorithm which computes a non-reversible set-length string of bits (SHA256: 256 bits, RIPEMD: 160 bits) out of an arbitrary input. The input in this case is the public key, and it will first be hashed by SHA256 and then RIPEMD. The result is a 160 bit number which is referred to as the address. The address is then encoded using BASE58CHECK, which encodes this number using a size-58 alphabet and a checksum (to account for typo's).\n\nWhen you want to receive money from someone, you send him the BASE58CHECK encoded address (the thing that starts with a 1, or in case of P2SH addresses, a 3). This person derives the 160-bit address out of that and formats a transaction spending money to this address. If you then want to spend the money that has been sent to you, you will simply prove you own the private key which corresponds to the public key which, when hashed, yields the 160-bit address the money has been sent to. The network will validate this, and if it all checks out, the transaction will be valid and included in the blockchain.\n\nNote that in this scheme the public key will only be exposed when you are *spending* money which has been previously sent to your *address*. An address has the added benefit of being protected by 3 algorithms, 2 of which are hashing algorithms which are exceptionally hard to break. The public key is protected only by ECDSA, which is secure, but a single-point-of-failure nonetheless.\n\nIt's generally better to never spend from the same address twice for this reason (security) aswell as privacy (there can only be one owner of an address, so multiple payments to the same address can possibly expose your identity), although it's perfectly possible.

The attack can quite trivially be identified when it's observed many transactions in a new block are not present in the mempool, and possibly be averted by a rough and loosely coordinated, and likely temporary, soft fork agreed upon by non-attacking majority of miners (if they so desire, and this would be very controversial).\n\nA side effect of this attack is also that it will take longer and consume more resources to validate the blockchain and run a node, which if the blocks in question are huge could be a real issue (although I am not all that convinced because I doubt the attack is in any way permanent).": 2, "Here's an approachable intro, or at least as approachable as the topic can be while actually conveying what happens:\n\nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=U2bw_N6kQL8\n\nHere's another one that's worth watching:\n\nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=JszfLU4ysEM\n": 2, 'One reason is because the code has not been compartmentalized.

The simple fact is that decentralisation via small blocksize is a fallacious argument as there are other things that are just as important that will degrade decentralisation if decentralisation via a small blocksize is their one and only priority. Adoption also needs to be protected, as well as innovation, availability, etc. \n\nIf their idea is that decentralisation can only be preserved via a fixed block cap, then they lack the foresight to realise that fixing the block cap will also throttle transactions, which will raise fees, which will drive users away, which will lower demand for Bitcoin\'s and the network, which will lead to the decline of full nodes and mining, as well as less investment in services. Less developers will find new innovative ways to use Bitcoin as it will be too expensive to use the blockchain. It will also mean less merchants as demand stagnates, which will mean less liquidity as it will be harder to spend coins, etc. etc. etc. If the demand increases, and Bitcoin doesn\'t find ways to handle the demand, people may very well simply move their demand to other alt coins.  \n\nAll these so-called innovations to move transactions off the blockchain are not available, nor are they even proven to be viable yet. Forcing them into existence, as Peter has characterised it, is an absolutely enormous and dangerous risk, he is literally betting Bitcoin\'s 3 billion dollar market cap on a race to innovate a solution to an imagined problem. Absolutely nowhere does it say that keeping the block size fixed will "force" innovations to handle the demand, the demand will simply walk across the street to litecoin, monero, doge, whatever. The devs are betting everyone else\'s money on something that may take years to materialise while we are all meant to sit and quietly pray that they are right.\n\nEd: paragraphs, and readability.': 2, 'Groundbeeftaxi do you have two accounts?': 1, "Well, I think the first thing they need to do is admit that keeping the block size fixed is not going to fix the problem, but will in fact exacerbate it. \n\nSecondly is to increase the blocksize its a short term solution, but it is necessary, and preferably they should be scheduled so that they gradually increase as mores law moves forward. That would relieve a great deal of pressure, and would be a solid start. It may even buy us several years and give everyone ample time to keep ahead of the technology curve, while other means of addressing increasing transactions can be relegated to offchain approaches for as long as possible before it gets settled on the blockchain proper.\n\nThirdly, they should see about what they can do to make nodes more decentralised. Full, pruned, and SPV nodes really need to be sharing more data around rather than having pruned and SPV nodes always depending on full nodes to serve them data (I may be wrong about how nodes interact here but I assume that full nodes are always depended on by pruned and SPV nodes, and SPV nodes are always dependant on pruned, and full nodes). In 10-15 years, I doubt anyone, except those doing it for profit will be running a full node, but that will only happen if Bitcoin's adoption is allowed to increase, and right now, not increasing the block size will see Bitcoin stay a rinky-dink toy currency while other promising networks, like Monero, that has an elastic blocksize, or (shudder) Ripple, could be given the opportunity it needs to eclipse Bitcoin. \n\nPeople often talk about ways to incentivise nodes to keep them around, and that increasing the block size will destroy Bitcoin's decentralisation as the burden of running them makes most of them disappear, but I doubt we'll need to do anything, eventually, they'll become scarce enough that you will have to pay full node operators to use them. This isn't a bad thing though, much like mining, markets will pop up around running a full node, such that people will have a financial incentive to run a node. With enough demand, nodes will never disappear, instead nodes will increase relative to the number of Bitcoin users needing verification of their transactions, if there are hundreds of millions of SPV wallets, and only a several thousand full nodes, there's a good chance they will be willing to pay to use that service. What will need to happen though is that pruned and SPV nodes will need to manage the data they get more efficiently. This means they should be talking to each other, sharing data they have or don't have, so that they can avoid needing to ask full nodes. This will take bandwidth burden off full nodes, making them cheaper to run and more scalable. Sharing data between all the different types of nodes, will reduce dependence on full nodes for every piece of data, thus making the whole network more decentralised.\n\nFourthly (which is what the majority of devs want to do first and is the hardest to do IMO), is find ways to offchain transactions, much like lightning, lighthouse and payment channels. Encouraging the development of more projects that can bundle transactions in various ways before settlement will help move low priority, or high volume transactions off-chain, and allow Bitcoin's transaction load to increase without unnecessarily burdening full nodes nodes or miners.\n\nThis is just off the top of my head, but it's what I'd propose they be doing.": 1, 'I laughed at "Shatoshi", what in the hell did I just read?': 2, 'Thank you for the informative post!

So I think you\'re trying to solve a problem which doesn\'t exist.\n\nPeople have suggested that there would be an incentive for miners to be dishonest in such a "voting", but I find these game theoretic arguments unconvincing. Although it is a heretical and shocking view, I think people are generally somewhat decent.

That\'s certainly conceivable to me. But if it does reach the reset, then I think all the voting in the world won\'t matter: I think there will be two different chains in perpetuity competing under the "Bitcoin" brand: one which keeps the 1Mb block size and has a minority of the hashing power and one which expands to the 20Mb block size and has the majority of the hashing power.': 3, 'But the next fork is not going to be a soft one...  \n\nThat method seems worse than scheduling the fork at a fixed block number in the future.

One of the numbers that has been thrown out there is 800 out of the last 1000 blocks needed to change. But if 20% of the hashing power left behind is too much it could be something else, 900/1000, 950/1000, 999/1000, it could even be 1000/1000, but that could a long time to achieve.\n\nFull nodes can see which blocks are on which version and how fast blocks with the new version are taking over.

To carry any weight to current and prospective customers, the audit would have to be performed by a reputable, professional, independent 3rd party.  It would be a fairly significant cost relative to the value of the company to have these audits on an on-going basis.\n\n2) Lack of customer acquisition resulting from an audit.  The only real reason (outside of any potential regulatory compliance) to do this audit would be to advertise to potential new customers that their technology and company is audited however frequently.  Would this give their company a competitive advantage?  Perhaps.  But also, perhaps not, at least not right now while Bitcoin is still limited to extremely early adopters.  Also, even if it does give them a competitive advantage, is that competitive advantage greater than the cost of the audits?  Perhaps when adoption rates rise and there\'s suddenly many "everyday folks" on the fence and the verge of adopting, this type of auditing will be crucial to gain their trust and business.\n\n3) Reliability of the audit.  Bitcoin is such a new technology, I\'m not sure we even have reputable, 3rd party independent auditors who could audit effectively and issue an opinion that would carry any sort of weight for potential new customers or investors.  It\'s much different if Deloitte is willing and has the expertise to come in and audit vs. Joe Schmoe Technologies.\n\n4) What standard are we auditing to?  Accounting has US GAAP.  IT Auditing has ISACA.  What exists for Bitcoin that we can measure up against and say we are in compliance with, and what are we going to report out to our customers/investors?  This also leads to my last...\n\n5) Upcoming regulations.  Does it make sense to invest in a certain type of audit now (which performs various specific testing) that could be totally meaningless and require the company to change gears to adhere to future regulations?

Now if you create a transaction using either client and spend the 1.0 balance it shows, you are transferring BOTH coins to the recipient of your payment.\n\nTo decouple the coin you need to taint one side or the other with some coin mined post-fork.

This blockchain with the 1MB limit can persist (and be mined with new blocks) indefinitely.\n\nNow -- if there is market for the newly mined coins, post-fork, on the original chain side then if you spend your untainted bitcoins then you are leaving money on the table.  The recipient of your payment is now the one who can spend your payment on both chains.

Refining your point, a 33rd percentile is better than a median because it would make it harder for larger better connected miners to push other miners out, and using a stated size preference within the current size, rather than the actual size is better (you can always fake the actual size by padding blocks or dropping txn, but if you\'re actually overloaded you shouldn\'t lose out on fees to express a preference for a smaller block)-- with those changes you have one of my oldest base proposals.\n\nProbably the biggest challenge in this whole discussion is this philosophical break about what Bitcoin should be where some reject the idea that there should be fee pressure at all, or that centralization the operation of the system would be a total failure-- for example.
