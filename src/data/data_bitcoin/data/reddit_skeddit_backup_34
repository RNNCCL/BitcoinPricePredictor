If the variable costs (electricity) are high compared to the capital outlay requirement (mining HW), then this makes the relative cost of hoarding miners low, and motivates the miner to hoard mining equipment near to cheap electricity.\n\nIf the variable costs are low compared to the capital outlay requirement, then there is much less relative advantage to mining near to cheap electricity.\n\nSo efficiency is extremely important to geographic decentralization.  The more efficient a miner, the less relatively advantageous it is to mine where power is cheapest.  In the absurd example, a miner that uses no electricity is equally efficient everywhere.\n\nThe next issue is scale and monopolization.  For so long as a next-gen processor will promise a 10X scaling factor, miners will compete to produce this processor at virtually any cost.  This means that to date, we have seen mining hardware dominated by customers with very deep pockets willing to produce expensive new-gen hardware in small batch sizes.  When next-gen processors produce only, say, 15% improvements in performance, then it will not be possible to finance the R&D with only a few very deep pockets.  One can imagine a big mining operation deciding *not* to upgrade to new miners because the expense wouldn't justify the improvement in hashrate.\n\nInstead, hardware vendors will have to expand their base by producing less expensive, more efficient processors in higher volume.\n\nWe can see that heretofore, only those few people with the deepest pockets have access to leading-edge mining hardware which is necessary for the security (and control) of the blockchain.  When next-gen hardware becomes only marginally more powerful, but cheaper, more power efficient, and more plentiful, it will be less easy to monopolize by a few power players.": 9, 'The lower the temp, the faster the chips can run = means more hash power with the same area of silicon.

Whereas the other end of the spectrum, where abuse of technology by bad people are not of governments, are often in areas where the general population has been disarmed and deprived of (through governments), the very same technology that the bad people are using against the general population which has been made defenseless.\n\n\nLiberty is power, and protection from abuse of power at the same time.
