This has the effect of miners enforcing a soft block size limit which is lower than the hard limit, to reduce supply and drive up fees.

Segwit-style increases have a lot more code complexity which affects all clients, including SPV wallets. Blocksize increases do not.

All the various forms of decentralization that we\'re talking about are just means to ends.  What do we really want? Why do we really care about decentralization?  Satoshi suggested we want decentralization for a variety of reasons, including to make bitcoin censorship-resistant, robust, etc.  It\'s important to identify *why* we want decentralization, because it may lead us to accept different marginal costs.  There is a cost to maintaining 5,000 nodes, and a bigger cost to increasing to 30,000 nodes, etc.  Exactly what are we gaining from the increase in nodes?  How much additional censorship resistance?

They didn't have agreement on this topic and it went nowhere.\n\nThey are focusing on new features for new core versions that should help make it easier for people to run a node: a new crypto library to make verifying transactions many times faster, pruning to make running a node require much less disk space, a new way to do off chain trust less transactions using payment channels that should reduce the burden on the blockchain for many uses, new simplified verification modes to make running new types of lite clients much more trustless, etc\n\nOn the other side, Gavin calls running a node a fetish.

Or at the very least, if we actually believe that there\'s a strong connection between node count and the strength of the network, shouldn\'t the core devs be focusing on new implementations that will increase node count (not just avoid decreasing)? \n\nIn other words, why the asymmetry?

For example if nodes are out of reach of everyone except big companies like Apple and Google, that won't really be a decentralized system and those companies will enforce crippling regulatory constraints on people. You can already see this today with Coinbase shutting people's accounts down randomly. If you think people can just use lite clients, that's not stable because they only use miner security and miners can easily be centralized and therefore regulatory attacked. The possibility of switching to full nodes acts as a check on that potential attack.\n\nSecond: in theory, miners can carry out out attacks where they manipulate block size to get an advantage.
