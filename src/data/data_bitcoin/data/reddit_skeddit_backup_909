Bitcoin operates as a decentralised peer-to-peer payment network designed to reinvent the way that money works.*  \n*Bitcoins are already widely used for in-person and online purchases. Bitcoin can be acquired by exchanging 'national' currencies (e.g. AUD) for them through an online exchange or through a Bitcoin ATM, or by accepting them as a gift or in exchange for goods and services.*\n\n*The draft ruling treats bitcoins akin to a barter arrangement, with similar tax consequences.*\n\n*I commend the ATO on providing clear and intelligent guidance on bitcoin treatment.*  \n\n*I believe the Australian Tax Office\xe2\x80\x99s draft ruling is mostly fair and reasonable, however I find one main point highly concerning.*  \n*That is:*  \n*>A transfer of bitcoin is a 'supply' for GST purposes.*\n\n*This effectively means that bitcoins will be double-taxed when used for purchases in Australia.*  \n*GST will first be charged on the initial bitcoin acquisition. GST will then also be charged when using bitcoins to purchase goods or services.*\n\n*Bitcoin acquisition should be exempt from GST in the same way that foreign currency purchases are exempt.*  \n*We currently pay GST on the service fee to acquire the currency, but not on the capital outlay.*\n\n*The ATO's ruling will create unnecessary paperwork and red-tape. It's an unfair burden on the legitimate users of bitcoin in Australia.*  \n*This ruling is not in the best interests of Australians and will put the Australian economy at a major disadvantage compared to more favourable jurisdictions.*\n\n*In these early days of such a exciting and revolutionary new technology, the ATO must allow a GST exemption to the supply of bitcoin for the Australian digital economy to reap bitcoin's full benefits.*\n\n*Kind regards,  \n<me>*": 1, 'DC POS logs enough sales information for our merchants to comply.

If the value is based on solid utility and not just wild speculation why does the value drop so much sometimes? It's down 55% from the all time high, did the utility go away? ": -2, 'Jeffrey,\n\n"In my own mind, I toyed with the issue for more than a year. It puzzled me." I bet that is what happened to von Mises when trying to invent the regression theorem as well. You are right when trying to apply the regression theorem to bitcoin, since:\n\n*bitcoin is a medium of exchange at present\n\n*the logic of the regression theorem is not hard to verify\n\n==Back in time==\n\nWhat has to be done when applying the regression theorem is to go back in time (or to imagine going back in time, if you prefer) to the moment when bitcoin was not a medium of exchange. In accordance with the regression theorem, at this specific moment in time bitcoin cannot be valued as a medium of exchange, a currency, or money, since it is not a medium of exchange yet. Similarly, the bitcoin system cannot be valued as a payment system, since it is not a payment system yet. Thus, the simple argument that the payment system gives the value to bitcoin at this specific moment in time does not work.\n\n==Using our present knowledge==\n\nBitcoin was not a medium of exchange back then, but, judging from the present, it was of economic advantage to acquire some bitcoins and wait until now. Is it possible that the present outcome has given bitcoin economic value in the past?\n\n==Claim to expected economic benefits==\n\nThe objection that nobody knew the present outcome in the past is relevant. However, due to bitcoin design, there was an expectation that bitcoin would become a medium of exchange materializing its possible economic advantages. Therefore, at the time in the past it was possible to evaluate bitcoin as a claim to expected economic benefits, i.e., similarly as any claim to expected economic benefits. To do such an evaluation precisely, one should enlist the possible outcomes, their future valuations and their probabilities. To obtain a positive valuation it suffices to realize that:\n\n*the possible outcomes are nonnegative\n\n*at least one possible outcome is positive\n\n*the probability of a positive outcome is greater than zero\n\nThus, bitcoin had a positive value as a "claim to expected economic benefits". The term looks rather complicated. Perhaps a simpler term expressing the same in a more succinct way is "a collectible", as in "collect and wait until the expected economic benefits materialize".': 1, 'Sorry, but you\'re still not on the right track.  Bitcoin *does* contradict the regression theorem, because the regression theorem is backwards.\n\nThe regression theorem basically asserts that monetary value comes from the *past*;  eg. gold had value in the past, therefore it has value today.\n\nBut this is obviously bullshit.  Seashells had value in the past, but they don\'t have much value today.  Zimbabwe dollars had value in the past, but they don\'t have much value today.  Sticks and giant stones and dozens of other monetary systems and fiat currencies had value in the past, but no value today.\n\nSo, the regression theorem has it completely backwards.  Monetary value doesn\'t come from the past.  It comes from expected *future* value.  Seashells had expected future value, at one time, because there was no better alternative means of trade.  Gold has expected future value, because gold a thousand years from now is the same as gold today, except perhaps more scarce.  (Or perhaps not.)  Paper currency has expected future value, because people who like to pay taxes will accept it for goods and services, to pay taxes in the future.\n\n>I will cut to the chase and reveal it: Bitcoin is both a payment system and a money.\n\nStill not right.  It\'s only a "payment system" for Bitcoins, just like every other currency is technically a "payment system" for itself.  That\'s not a distinguishing feature.  The currency still has to have value for someone to want it, even if it is easy to transfer over large distances, as with Bitcoin.  In every instance, that value comes from the *future*, not the past.\n\nIn short, the regression theorem is backwards.  Monetary value is future value.': 4, 'This amounts to circumlocution and ends up squashing a pig in a poke, methinks.

The buyer is paying full price for the item on your amazon wish list and purse.io holds the sellers bitcoin in escrow until the seller receives the item and releases them. Saying that you are buying a gift card at a 30% discount is not true, you are trading bitcoin at a markup to someone that is paying amazon full price for your item with a credit card. In theory this markup makes sense since besides circle, where else can you buy bitcoin with a credit card? Using the amazon wish list is a clever way of doing this. I wish it worked as well as it does in theory. \n\nI created a couple wish lists, sent some bitcoin to purse.io and set up a 20% discount. One item was about $50 so they would receive $40 worth of bitcoin at whatever the bitstamp price is at the time of purchase. I had two items up and within an hour or so I had a buyer, or so I thought. About ten minutes after I got the email saying a buyer was found the item popped back up in my amazon wish list because amazon canceled it, probably because they detected it as fraud. Purse.io detected this and relisted my sell order automatically. This happened about 3-4 times on each item by people with 0 rating before someone with a higher rating purchased the item and it finally went through. I received the items a couple days later and released the bitcoins from escrow. I gave and received positive feedback on both transactions. \n\nI think that there are legitimate people paying a premium for bitcoin using credit cards on purse.io but there are also scammers trying to use stolen credit cards, maybe at a 3:1 ratio of scammer to legit. I\'m sure amazon deals with stolen credit cards constantly and their system seemed to handle it well as far as I can tell.  \n\nI don\'t think amazon would ever come back to me if down the road it turned out that the credit card someone used was stolen. The wish lists are anonymous, I have no information on who bought the item and amazon knows it. I\'m not sure what information amazon has on the buyer but they accepted the order,not me, and would be responsible for it. The default setting on amazon is to surprise you with the gift. You wouldn\'t even know someone bought you something until it arrives at your door. How can you be liable for that purchase?\n\nThat said I won\'t be using purse.io anymore. They need to implement some sort of buyer verification across the board where it is known they are not using a fraudulent credit card. Maybe do a couple small deposits like a typical bank account or credit card verification on venmo, dwolla, coinbase, or circle? They do have a guarantee program where if you specify 10% or less you will be matched with only "VIP" buyers (invite only) in 24 hours or purse.io will buy it for you but it isn\'t enough. It gives you a very weird feeling to know that people are actively trying to defraud amazon. I\'m sure amazon deals with it constantly but I don\'t like being an indirect participant. I have no idea if the people that I completed the trades with are legit or just didn\'t get caught yet. The multiple fraudulent purchases that were caught is not a good user experience. The $20 or so I saved wasn\'t really worth it. Overall I like the idea and wish it would work but right now it just isn\'t for me.

In this case a bit different as the private key is both the password, and is what the email address is derived from!). So in that sense, you have to own a unique private key that nobody else has. Which is pretty easy, as there are 2^256 possible private keys. There are nearly as many private keys as there are atoms in the universe. For quick context, if you could count so fast that you could count from 1 to trillion every second, and you counted for a trillion centuries, you'd only count to 2^72, nowhere close to 2^256.\n\nSo if you have such a unique piece of data called a private key that only you know, you could semantically say you own it. And you can use that in the bitcoin technology to send bitcoins to and from that key, in the most simple terms. \n\nIf you break it down, owning bitcoin means you own a unique password that gives you unique and sole access to change slots in a public ledger.\n\nThat sounds vague, but that's what money is. A lot has been written about this, academically mostly. The notion of money being memory for example, is satisfied with a public ledger. Dollars are just the tokens with which we memorize debt. i.e. if you paint my house, I have nothing to offer you immediately, so we remember. And when you need something in return you say 'remember I painted your house? ok now help me with this'. That's a limited system of 1 to 1 relationships, hard to measure etc. So we use dollars as the tokens. Instead of memorizing and arguing later about how much the painting was worth, we agree the price, I pay you $100 for painting the house, and now that in-debts me (or anyone else I got the dollars from, who in that trade were indebted to me) to perform $100 of service at some later point.

It\'s all entries on a decentralized ledger, and there\'s nothing being "exchanged" back and forth during a transaction; it\'s just numbers changing on the ledgers.

The poker chips have value because you have a reasonable expectation that the casino will give you dollars in return for them.  \n\nDollars work the same way.  The paper isn't valuable because of it's *intrinsic* properties, but because you have a reasonable expectation that other people will take them.

So that's bitcoins; digital tokens that represent value.\n\nNow, the dollar admittedly has an advantage over bitcoin in that a large powerful entity requires their use to pay taxes, which generates demand.

We need a way to measure subjective value in a standard way.  The measurement of a specific good or service\'s value is unique to each individual, but as a society, bartering is inefficient.  If we all agree that a certain commodity is a representation of a unit of value, all of a sudden we can all subjectively value things using the same measurement.  Then we can all barter for the *same* good, and use that good to barter for other goods.  Whatever good we use as the medium for exchange, we call "money".

I know I have brakes and they stop my car and I have brakepads and somehow the system gets the wheels to stop turning. But there\'s a lot of stuff in between that is just a big mystery.

Well, we sort of do that now already. But maybe something more obvious, or made specifically for Bitcoin users?\n\nThe tricky part about computers is that software often needs to be patched for vulnerabilities. So the ratings would probably need to be tied to the software versions. Perhaps some software that could tell you the an approximate system risk level for handling Bitcoins safetly given your current setup? Maybe it could detect when you\'re on an unencrypted WiFi network and immediately "go red" indicating your system is not secure.

[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFDe5kUUyT0) is a good video explaining the workings of our current monetary system, made fragile by deficit spending and fractional reserve lending, and why it might well collapse soon.\n\nHere\'s one problem which needs to be put on the table if we want to debate Bitcoin\'s value properly: we need to differentiate between money and currency: currency (e.g. Dollar, Euro, etc) has no intrinsic value; it\'s easily used for barter, but it can lose pretty much all of its value through deflation. Money can be used for barter, but has intrinsic value (e.g. gold, silver), unlike currency. If the monetary system crashes, paper dollars will have no value, but gold will still have value.\n\nNow, all currencies that have ever existed have all failed after some point, because they have no intrinsic value, and governments can print them. Gold and silver have been money for centuries, simply because they can\'t be printed.\n\nBitcoin has advantages and disadvantages: it can be traded very easily without middlemen, which makes it great for barter. It also can\'t be printed, just like metals. *But*, it has no intrinsic value (as Warren Buffet and others have pointed out), and it\'s still speculative at this point, which means that when the financial crash comes, people might either rush into Bitcoin for the super-easy ability to trade it, or rush away from Bitcoin because it\'s never been "stress-tested" during a crisis and they have more confidence in metals. During previous crises, people sought refuge in metals to escape from currency devaluation; crypto-currencies are a new phenomenon, and may or may not take the status of "money refuge" alongside precious metals.\n\nEither way, the price of Bitcoin will likely go way up, or way down during this very decade, depending on how people respond to the crisis.

Typically those would be run by exchanges, mining pools, "banks," and large businesses that want to process their own transactions quickly and securely. But yes, it would be less efficient that just an interaction between the merchant\'s credit card POS and their bank, HOWEVER, don\'t forget that just in that interaction you need a lot of accounting, regulation, fraud insurance, and other stuff just to make it work. Bitcoin takes care of all that just with the redundant nodes.\n\nRegarding hashing, no, servers don\'t need to hash. They just verify and process transactions. The only things hashing are miners, who don\'t even need to have a server themselves, and get the work they need to hash from the pool that runs the node (so you could have hundreds of miners, and just one pool with a server node).\n\nWith regards to nodes, keep in mind that wallets that don\'t run their own nodes (SPV) typically verify transactions they receive themselves, and verify balances and transactions by crosschecking multiple nodes. So even if the number of nodes was very low, not only would all those nodes have to collude (unlikely if they are competing for miners), but any false transactions they try to send are likely to be rejected by those wallets too.\n\nAnd finally, most people won\'t have to be their own bank. With multi-signature addresses, it is fairly easy to set up wallets that require a "bank" to countersign every one of your transactions, and run an algorithm that will monitor for any suspicious activity. So if you get robbed, the thief will not get much. Such banks can also offer insurance (you\'ll pay a checking account fee like you do at many banks now), and similar insurance can also cover the merchants you shop with (it\'s called "assurance," where the company assures you against causing harm to others, as opposed to other things harming you). You would shop from merchants that have assurance coverage, and if they steal from you, the assurance will cover your loss. Don\'t shop from merchants with bad assurance, or who are being forced to pay high premiums, because that tells you they are not trustworthy (those who are will have very minimal fees).\n\nHope that helps.': 4, 'What bank you work for shill?

You're confusing full nodes and miners. Full nodes don't use 100% CPU, they just relay information (like transactions and blocks) over the Bitcoin p2p network. Miners have a full node running and then send over some of the data (difficulty, previous block hash, Merkle root of transactions, etc) to special hardware that mines. The efficiency of the mining hardware has *nothing* to do with processing transactions at all.": 9, "I don't think comparing bitcoin to traditional banking is the right idea here, because bitcoin has other nice properties that have nothing to do with the efficiency of the consensus scheme - for example, it is an open network that anyone can participate in. It is entirely digital, so the marginal cost of a transaction is very low, and opens the door to things like smart contracts and machine-to-machine payments. It's a bearer instrument, so you can hold and transact in it with no counterparty risk (cf. stories of paypal arbitrarily freezing accounts, etc).\n\nOn the other hand, you could have a digital financial network/crypto-currency with much of the same properties as bitcoin, but with a more efficient consensus scheme, such as alt-coins which use proof-of-stake instead of proof-of-work, or networks like Ripple that have their own non-mining consensus scheme - this I think is the appropriate comparison.\n\nI think however it starts to get very technical, in comparing all the different consensus methods.": 3, "> Bitcoin is immune to inflation\n\nIt's actually not.

Fedwire transfers, like bitcoin, are [final and irrevocable](http://www.federalreserve.gov/paymentsystems/fedfunds_about.htm) once processed and don't have customer protections either since it does not interface with the customer (see [this blog post](http://gendal.wordpress.com/2013/11/24/a-simple-explanation-of-how-money-moves-around-the-banking-system/) by /u/gendal for a comparison of the two).\n\nThe difference between Fedwire and bitcoin is that bitcoin does not depend on a central party to maintain the ledger, and it pays the price in terms of the hashing network required. Whether this is a good tradeoff depends on your point of view, and how the network evolves in the future.\n\nWith regard to consumer payments - additional payment layers will most definitely be built on top of bitcoin just like current payment methods ([BIP 70](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0070.mediawiki) is an example of this, adding PKI in order to secure payment identities), so as to add consumer protection (see [Stripe's bitcoin blog post](https://stripe.com/blog/bitcoin-the-stripe-perspective) for some ideas on this) and also things like instant confirmations and fee-less micropayments, which are all a necessary part of the consumer payments infrastructure.": 9, 'Yeah bitcoin is less efficient than a centralized service.

I believe there are something like 8000 nodes on the network, and every one must process every single transaction. This is a pointless duplication of effort, and highly inefficient.\n\nNo, that's called decentralization, it isn't pointless, it secures the network. It's a necessity to create a system anyone can connect to without needing permission. \n\n>I transfer money from my bank to another bank, or buy something with a credit card, a few servers at the credit card company and at the banks involved must process the transaction. The other thousands of banks around the world don't have to know anything about it. Having 8000 servers process the same duplicate transaction is, of course, thousands of times less efficient than having it processed by just a few servers.\n\nExcept my credit card takes 2-3 days for something to show up on the statement, Bitcoin is instant. So it's not making it inefficient. The blockchain also secures bitcoin. If you have just a few servers we don't know what those servers are doing, who controls them, who manipulates them, etc. Not to mention that you can not play the role of that server and must rely on interacting with a bank to do so. This bank then charges a fee. With Bitcoin you can do what ever you want and not pay a fee because you don't need to go though an intermediary. \n\n>So, it seems to me that the Bitcoin network is 100 or 1000 times less efficient than a traditional banking or credit card network.\n\nA credit card charging fees and I  give a merchant the ability take money from me every time I pay (because credit/debit cards a a pull mechanism) This means I revealed  sensitive info that can be used to charge me in the future without my approval. With Bitcoin I don't relieve sensitive info as it is a push technique where I deposit funds to the merchant (rather than them withdraw funds to me).\n\nSure Bitcoin uses more processing power (if you don't like that check out POS coins), but it does so in achieving something a centralized network can't. \n\nThink of it this way. If 5 strangers go ahead and put down $20 each on a table it becomes very easy for us all to agree at the end that we each own $20 of that dollars. So it's very easy to believe the truth. Now we could all act in our own interest. I could say that I own $40, you say that you own $80. But we are all acting in our own self interests. We can't all still act in our own self interest and each come to the same conclusion. You can't go take $80 from the pile and not have be object. So my point is. It is very easy for a lot of strangers to agree on the truth together than it is from them to act in their own self interest. This is the basic concept of a decentralized network. Because there are so many participants no one can act in their own self interest because they will be overridden by the truth. Contrary to this your bank and credit card is centralized. They aren't a bunch of strangers so they can collaborate with each other and find something that is in their self interest and make it work because there isn't anyone to object. This is why fractional reserves are able to exist with fiat so easily. ": 2, 'Decentralization *is* less efficient than centralization. It must be. Therefore it is not useful to everyone, nor must it be.': 7, "The bitcoin network often appears inefficient because much of the work it is performing is kind of invisible and usually taken for granted. This work is 'trust work'. This work is usually called verification, confirmation,vetting, risk management, auditing, regulation, etc...\n\nThe traditional (read: historical) model of trust work goes this way:\nAlice would like to exchange with Bob. However, Alice doesn't know if Bob is trustworthy. To offset the risks and costs of trusting Bob, Alice engages a trusted third-party TrustCo Inc. This is an efficient and straightforward method of minimising risk in the exchange between Alice and Bob. However, by centralising trust work for efficiency and security, we have also introduced a point of failure. Worse, we have set a limit of participants that is defined by the maximum work capacity of our centralised 'trust work' entity, TrustCo Inc.\n\nThis model has many benefits and has served humanity fairly well. However, it inevitably leads to crises and does not scale well. In a blockchain network - such as Bitcoin - trust work is distributed as evenly as possible across all participants in the network. This reduces, perhaps even removes, the points of failure. It also means that each new participant that enters the network doesn't just increase the trust work required, they also perform trust work. As long as the system allows each new participant to perform more trust work than they require, then the system scales by design.\n\nThis new kind of method is actually very, very old. This article explains it well.\nhttp://letstalkbitcoin.com/the-island-of-stone-bitcoins/": 2, "Centralized processors are more efficient, no doubt about it.  I don't trust them, though.

I don\'t receive the service from you as promissed, I don\'t release theb] 2-of-2 multisig escrow.\n\nYou need to look at the equally big picture when comparing network efficiency - ultimately, even banks have to agree on and reconcile their balances. All of them. That is why it is possible to estimate the money supply. Lots of work there is done by central banks, and even more globally by the "bank of international settlements" and the likes. Besides efficiency there is also the issue of fairness.\n\nNext, hashing is not meaningless crunching of numbers, nor "solving increasingly complex puzzles" as it is often misportrayed. Hashing calculates secure, tamper-proof digest values of global transactional data, in a way that ensures steady, predetermined, self-regulated, and democratic rate of processing transactions and distributing newly minted coins.': 1, 'The general opinion of this thread seems to be that the bitcoin network is, in fact, less efficient than traditional banking, but that it still has value in various other ways.\n\nHowever the mainstream financial community and media are completely unaware of this, and are operating under the assumption that bitcoin will have value in the future due to the low fees resulting from its inherent efficiency.\n\nThe business community, the financial community, can be interested in a currency or money transfer system which promises to save money.
