The only question is when will bitcoin truly fail, and will it be before or after the us dollar and other traditional currencies have failed?': 1, 'What a lack of understanding.  Central banks are (supposedly) formed to protect economies by taking measures that put a currency at risk.  They protect economies by adjusting supply of the currency.  But adjusting the supply of a currency puts the currency in jeopardy.  Sometimes protecting the economy can amount to adjusting supply to keep a stable value to the currency.  If central banks cannot adjust supply, then the argument goes that the economy could face additional trouble.  However, even under the scenario of economic trouble, a fixed supply currency can remain strong (probably stronger) than one that has the supply tampered with.  Accordingly, even if their premise was true (that we need controlled currencies to protect economies), all that means is that a Bitcoin fueled economy is a less stable, but that does not mean that the currency itself is less stable.\n\nGiven the choice between a mature fixed supply currency or a variable supply currency--that can be artificially devalued--the reasonable person acting in their own best interest will choose to store wealth where it cannot be tampered with.  This is true even where that person may believe that society is better off if everyone chooses to use a currency controlled by a central bank.  In other words, a "tragedy of the commons" type situation develops where the individual\'s best interest is in conflict with the best interest of the whole.  Accordingly the whole adopts what is in the best interest of the individual.  That means Bitcoin can prevail notwithstanding a widely held belief that it should not.\n\nTo be clear, I do not believe that a fixed supply currency is bad for an economy.

GDP increases with consumer spending, so I imagine that consumer spending will pressure the Bitcoin value upwards. Now, investment also increases GDP, so hodling isn't bad.

To address these concerns, a central bank could go one step further and issue a cryptocurrency (Fedcoin) offered at a fixed exchange rate where payments are cleared using a Bitcoin-inspired anonymous communal consensus algorithm.

': 1, "Just want to make sure you are talking about criminal trials here.  Civil trials do not have the same burden of proof, jury trials are restricted to serious damages, etc.\n\nIn criminal law, and the fundamental idea behind our judicial system is that justice is blind.  This means justice goes into each and every trial with zero idea of a guilty or not guilty verdict. All the facts must be presented and interpretation of law must be established.  The idea of a peer is someone who is a person, like you.  You could very well meet the 12 people on the jury pool by luck (highly unlikely but play along) and become friends with them even if they have different social norms, cultural background etc. That is the legal definition of a peer.  Not someone who you play basketball and have known for 15 years. \n\nInstead of having a benevolent dictator decide your fate, 12 random people are to decide your fate and recommend sentencing but only if they are unanimous in their decision.  This is why the facts need to be presented from scratch as if the jury as 10 year olds.  I know nothing about hair braiding and might kneejerk into the same reaction you have.  However the jury would hear from the prosecutors how they found over $16m of damages caused by unlicensed hair professionals.  $16m is a lot for a local county, I would hope my county is doing something to prevent that.  Ah, thats why there are licenses for hair braiding.  Silly but its for the greater good.\n\nI think the problem you have with this whole ordeal is that you do not find it to be intuitive or that you have a better idea of how to hold a court case.  The problem is the judicial system is designed to not be overthrown without checks and balances.  This helps prevent corruption that exists in eg the executive and legislative branches.  While judges and prosecutors can be paid off, it's much much harder to pay off 12 jurors.  All you need is 1 dissenting opinion and boom the trial is over.  BECAUSE OF THIS, making a change would require a trial in the very same courts.  Which ultimately plays out that the existing system works perfectly fine.\n\nAs an example of my last part, look at the Martin-Zimmerman case.  Zimmerman was completely within the purview of the law in his actions, but those prosecutor 'thugs' presented 'facts' which the 'jury' interpreted as not a violation of the law.  The hope on the prosecution side was that the jury would make a change, find Zimmerman guilty and thus establish case law against standing your ground.  Except the jury agreed that Zimmerman very well was standing his ground (evidenced by a dead man who can't speak, zimmerman alive and able to speak, and no witnesses).  Did zimmerman violate someone's rights?  Very possibly.  Should we jail anyone who shoots to kill?  No. And that's what the jury helped solidify in this case.\n\nBut i'm sure you're going to come back with something about how Ross Ulbricht deserved a better trial etc etc when in reality the jury heard everything maybe even felt bad for him for a little bit and then saw the full scope of what he was doing and said no one man should have all this power.

My belief is most of the reduction is related to other wallet options.  You believe it has more to do with increased node requirements.  That may indeed be true.  Fact of the matter is there is no incentive to run a node unless you want to independently verify the blockchain for yourself, aka a company.  Most "normal" users have no interest in this.  This will be true with a blocksize of 1MB or 100MB.\n\nIt\'s hard to complain about the node count, when they simultaneously have no incentive to run. \n\nThere really is no easy answer here, beyond a company and certain power users wanting the independent verification and others doing it out of generosity, nobody else wants to run a node.\n\nFixing the incentive will fix the problem.

Our basic position is that third parties should be no more able to observe what you consume on BitTorrent than they are able to see you consume on YouTube. There are a few best pract to this at present (coinjoin, stealth addresses, no address resuse, etc.), but nothing is perfect. I suppose confidential transactions and/or lightning will increase privacy in a more robust way, but until then, we can only follow best practices and inform people about how the system works."\n\nI also him post this on zapchain:\n"We need more content on JoyStream, post a link to a torrent file you would like the community to focus on sharing (only 100% legal content), and earn bits!"': 1, "If Joystream has end to end encryption as good as the other projects, then that would definitely help it compete, and I imagine that it would have to to get people to host *paid* seeds.
