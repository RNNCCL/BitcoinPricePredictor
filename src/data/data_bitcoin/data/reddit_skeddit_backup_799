Either this design is plausible in which case so is the DollarCoin Network, or it isn't, in which case bitcoin is doomed to fail in 2140. I believe it is feasible to incentivise miners with a floating tx fee which will be based on the marginal cost of running miners and that implies you could do the same thing with a premined government backed DollarCoin network.\n\nedit, as for who mines, well anyone can, but those that certainly will are national banks, companies, citizens, anyone who would prefer to see their economy run on a secure cheap open blockchain instead of behind the closed doors of central banks and policymakers offices would have in a interest in mining it.\nThis isnt great for bitcoin, but its not bad either, and its great for freedom and democratic oversight of monetary policy.": 1, '"I like new technolgy, i just cant live with the idea of other people getting rich holding BTC while im here sidelining and complaining how i like blockchain but not bitcoin" in a nutshell': 11, "Bullshit!

I've already mentioned one: currency wars. Tie a nation's existence to a money that it doesn't control, and you can bury it. That reason alone is a showstopper. Many others exist. \n\n> one day miners will be incentivised by transaction fees alone.\n\nOnly *after* having paid out billions in block rewards to build a vast mining network, which could never have been built on TX fees alone (and which you rightly point out might still fall on its face one day in the future when block rewards end).\n\nSo back to my earlier question: you roll out DollarCoin, now you need miners. But anyone wanting to mine will make more money mining a valuable coin that pays block rewards. So who mines DollarCoin?\n\nI think everyone goes through a learning stage where this (crypto -fiat) seems like a plausible argument. I also entertained it. But if you game it out, it doesn't work.\n\nStrapping a blockchain on a fundamentally centralized problem (like fiat money) is like adding carburetors to your horse. You say it will offer the benefits of decentralization. (1) no it won't and (2) decentralization isn't a benefit if your goal is preservation of centralization. All the things that Bitcoin brings are LIABILITIES in the current system. ": 2, 'The Blockchain is a distributed ledger that lists transactions in order that can be verified by any third party - just now, all Bitcoin does with it is watch money getting moved around. That\'s important and the incentive the creation of Bitcoin provides is important to keeping the whole thing working but that doesn\'t mean we couldn\'t do far more with a distributed ledger than we are.\n\nI would rather it was done separately from Bitcoin to reduce bloat and reduce the number of systems that can fail at a time and that would need to be banned, blocked and firewalled separately.\n\nI think that\'s where the Alt Coins with long term sticking power will come from - Blockchain based systems that produce cryptocurrency as a side effect not a goal, where the main goals are rewarding collaboration and contribution to a network easier when no one is in charge, to prevent systems where one person is arbitration in charge and to use it you have to trust that person.\n\nYes, there are things like Primecoin but those came at a time where creating an alt coin so you could get in early on the ground floor and make money from being an early adopter was the goal and they tacked something interesting onto Bitcoin so they would stand out from the other Alt Coins.\n\nI\'m not talking about Alt Coins that happen to use something potentially useful in the Proof Of Work or other solutions looking for a problem or that are trying to avoid the "why waste so much energy" question by having something they can point to.\n\nThe Blockchain contains the fundamental parts of a peer to peer transactional database where we don\'t need a secure host to hold onto login credentials or keep records everyone else doesn\'t have access to. We can use cryptography - keys and signatures - to do everything out in the open and still not fear tampering or misuse of the data or data being stolen or sold.\n\nThere is lots of potential we haven\'t begun to touch; the Blockchain does have potential on its own.': 1, 'Seriously, this might have been the first time that I actually spelled it out like holding lol': 1, 'I\'ll just repost this here:\n\nEveryone keeps saying, "blockchain technology is great, but it doesn\'t need Bitcoin."  It\'s like a mantra.  Blockchain = good, Bitcoin = irrelevant.\n\nThere is also this idea that blockchains can be repurposed and used independent of Bitcoin by centralized entities like banks and governments.\n\nThese people don\'t understand how blockchains work.\n\nTo the first point: a blockchain is secured by miners who compete with each other to profit from building the blockchain.  Without a valuable coin, miners will not build a valuable infrastructure to mine it.  Without a valuable mining infrastructure, the decentralized mining network is trivial to attack by a wealthy attacker.\n\nThis is the primary issue with alts: not that they embody bad ideas, but rather that the value proposition of (1) a highly competitive mining network, (2) mining a comparatively valuable coin with (3) relatively high capitalization *dwarfs* the value proposition of any new "altcoin ideas."\n\nThis is why in my opinion Bitcoin will remain the dominant blockchain / cryptocurrency until new technology is discovered that literally renders blockchains irrelevant.  New technologies will be layered on top of the existing protocol which will evolve slowly and purposefully.  *See: Linux kernel; TCP/IP, SMTP, HTTP protocols.*\n\n**TL;DR: the security of a blockchain is directly proportional to the value of its coin, and bootstrapping the value proposition of a decentralized coin is really, really hard.**\n\nThis immediately invokes the second point that needs refuting: that centralized operators like banks or governments could make a coin and control it by owning the mining network.  The theory is that they would operate miners inside a "closed" network, and distribute the mined coins however they prefer.   Like a "DollarCoin."  There is also the theory that businesses etc. might spin up their own coins to create "non-money" blockchains - like blockchains that just store contracts - independent of Bitcoin, the idea being that the mining network would be closed and secure within a "ring of trust."  I think both ideas are absurd.\n\nWhy is this absurd?  Because the minute you assume a centralized mining network operating within a secure "ring of trust", there\'s really no reason to use a blockchain at all.  Standard SQL databases and old-fashioned IT of the sort that banks already use *are actually better adapted for solving problems of centralized computing within a ring of trust.* \n\nBlockchains solve the problem of *decentralized* money and *decentralized* computing.  The minute you assume a "secure ring of trust" the benefit of a blockchain completely disappears, and it actually becomes a liability.\n\n**TL;DR: Using blockchains for centralized solutions is like attaching a carburetor and mufflers to your horse to get more "horsepower".**': 5, 'But then there are any number of alts that use blockchains.\n\nBanks could get together and pretty easily create their own alt too.': 1, '[**@balajis**](https://twitter.com/balajis):\n>[2014-10-27 14:57:24 UTC](https://twitter.com/balajis/status/526749510995673088)\n\n>"I like the Blockchain, just not Bitcoin" = "I like the Internet, just not the WWW".\n\n[**@deepakshenoy**](https://twitter.com/deepakshenoy):\n>[2014-10-27 18:57:28 UTC](https://twitter.com/deepakshenoy/status/526809924408340480)\n\n>[@balajis](https://twitter.com/balajis) [@bhorowitz](https://twitter.com/bhorowitz) The blockchain has far more uses than bitcoin, really...it could turn out bitcoin is the "gopher" of the internet :\\)\n\n[**@bhorowitz**](https://twitter.com/bhorowitz):\n>[2014-10-27 20:32:46 UTC](https://twitter.com/bhorowitz/status/526833908654944256)\n\n>[@deepakshenoy](https://twitter.com/deepakshenoy) [@balajis](https://twitter.com/balajis) the blockchain is validated by miners who work for incentives.

It means you can now pay a merchant in bitcoin, or indeed as e.g. a freelancer like myself, receive money in bitcoin from people across the world cheaply and quickly, yet not have to worry about getting rid of it because of volatility risk. It allows you to keep stable savings in bitcoin. \n\nAnyway, this service isn't for everyone. I guess a lot of 'us' are interested partially (or perhaps even mostly, for some) in bitcoin for exposure to potential value appreciation.

In contrast, a partial or fractional reserve is one in which you do not have physical possession of the assets necessary to account for 100% of your obligations. When banks issue a loan for example, they take some of their assets and give them to someone else. So if there were to be a run on the bank, and everyone said, "I want my money back" the bank would not be in physical possession of the assets necessary to honor their obligations. \n\nWe don\'t do that.

Of course the difficulty varies based on what distro you choose.\n\nFirst of all there were some issues with the makefiles in Armory, where some of the generated files would not be removed when make clean runs. This resulted in errors when trying to build Armory twice using Debian tools. So before doing anything else, I worked with upstream to get those issues resolved. Those issues aren't a problem if you use a clean chroot everytime you rebuild, but I don't so it was an issue.\n\nLets start with Debian. You start out by filing a RFP (Request for Package) if you want to see a piece of software in Debian, but are unable to or unwilling to package the software yourself. You file an ITP (Intent to Package) if you intend to package the software yourself. I go into more detail in [this post](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=485416.msg8892534#msg8892534).\n\nThen once someone files an ITP they follow the procedures in [The Debian New Maintainers' Guide](https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/maint-guide/). This involves taking the upstream tarball, running a command to make a debian directory, and populating the autogenerated files in that debian directory. Once you are done you try building the package with dpkg-buildpackage. One of the harder parts was the [debian/copyright file](https://tracker.debian.org/media/packages/a/armory/copyright-0.92.3-1), which must list all the copyrights of the files in Armory. So it is not just the technical aspects of packaging that can be difficult.\n\nMost of the work I did was in the patches I made to the Debian version of Armory. You can inspect them [here](http://sources.debian.net/src/armory/0.92.3-1/debian/patches/). It was tricky to remove the convenience copies of code (which are the libraries that Armory ships with). For Debian you are supposed to replace them with the libraries that Debian ships. It was tricky because Armory was my first package, so I didn't know quite the right way to do it.\n\nIt took me from filing the ITP at the beginning of June to the end of October to get Armory into Debian, but not all of that time was spent working on Armory. I am not a Debian Developer, so I needed a sponsor (who is a Debian Developer) to get Armory into Debian. So some time was spent waiting on a sponsor. Then when I got a sponsor I worked with him for a while on Armory and he was very helpful, but he eventually became busy with his real life job. So in the end it was a second sponsor who uploaded Armory. Also, during the period where I was working with the first sponsor, [this happened](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=731315.0), which made me wait for the next release, which took a while. Also there is a New Queue that all new Debian packages must go through to be reviewed. So it was around October 7 or 9 when Armory entered the New Queue. So most of October was spent just waiting for Armory to be approved.\n\nSo it took five months, but it would have taken a lot less if everything lined up better.\n\nUbuntu is very easy, because if you get your package into Debian, it will automatically sync to Debian. There are also other ways to get packages in Ubuntu, but I am not familiar with them.\n\nWow that was long.": 1, '[deleted]': 3, 'Armory without Bitcoin Core will still be useful for cold storage in offline mode.': 3, 'Good job joseph!

Ubuntu doesn't have an equivalent of Debian unstable. The development release of Ubuntu becomes the stable release.

Armory would get out of date and there could potentially be bugs from using old versions of Armory with newer versions of Bitcoin Core. Hopefully one day either Armory will be stable enough, or distro update policies will be changed, so that Armory can be in Ubuntu.\n\nI could probably setup an Ubuntu PPA for Armory if it would help you or others.

So Armory will still install without Bitcoin-Core.\n\nThis allows someone to install the Bitcoin-Core binaries, or build from source and use it in conjunction with Armory from the Debian repos.\n\nI will admit that it does kind of defeat the purpose of providing a convenient method of installing Armory through Debian if the user has to go download Bitcoin-Core from a website.\n\nBitcoin-Core is only in unstable. There is a [release-critical bug blocking Bitcoin-Core from migrating to testing](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=718272), because the maintainers want to prevent Bitcoin-Core from entering stable, which would make it difficult to provide timely updates to Bitcoin-Core.\n\nThe reason that Armory will be in stable is that it uses Bitcoin-Core to do all communication with the Bitcoin network.

Not because I\'m untrustworthy, but because the point of cryptocurrency is to be trustless.\n\nIn embracing a solution for that, I admit we have been remiss. But it\'s only because we have been entirely focused on trying to provide and improve the services we do provide.\n\nLet me start by saying I, Jason King, do not derive any salary or monetary compensation from Sean\'s Outpost. In fact, the cost of running Sean\'s Outpost has greatly outpaced the amount of donations we have received. The additional costs of operating have to date been covered by wife and I.\n\nThe only board member who receives compensation is Michael Kimberl, who is head of operations for Sean\'s Outpost Pensacola. YTD he has been paid $21,500, which is low for both field of work and geographic area.\n\nWhile we may not have optimal "blockchain reporting" all our works are very open and available to the public, everyday. We provide over 2,000 meals a week to the homeless in Pensacola and another 250+ in Dallas.\n\nYou can just show up, anyday and watch the meals being prepared and delivered. \n\nTo date we have fed over 125,000 meals to the homeless. Our cost of production and delivery of meals has been publicly disclosed from day 1 and averages $1.25 per meal, delivered.\n\nWe also own, operate, and pay mortgage on Satoshi Forest, a 9 acre homeless sanctuary. We pay $600 a month mortgage, $200 for sanitation services, $75 a month for water, $250 for dumpster and between $100 and $200 a month for inspection services from the department of health and human services.Which, by the way, has consistently been given the highest rating available in Florida. \n\nWe have also defended the right to operate Satoshi Forest in court four times. And won. Our pending lawsuit brought against Satoshi Forest by Escambia country was dropped earlier this month.\n\nSince January, we have also operated Satoshi Thrift, a thrift store and homeless services center. Most famously, it was used as the only available shelter in Pensacola when Pensacola flooded in April. The lease on the 11,000sf facility is $2300 and has a utility cost of around $600 per month. The future of Outpost Thrift is unknown at this point as we are much better at feeding and helping the homeless than running a retail establishment. We had hoped to transform the building into a homeless training center, but the funds are simply no there and we have not been able to generate enough revenue from the store to keep it in operation.\n\nWhat needs to change?\n\nOne, we need a wallet that will allow for easy tagging of PAYMENT CLASS that is a requirement of sending funds from the wallet. This would make accounting automatic and not be a burden for any non profit. We could then provide a link to a graph that would show an up to the minute breakdown of funds received and how they have been spent. In addition, a way to easily provide "social proof" and attach it to a transaction would be AMAZING. Saying you bought 200 meals is nice, SHOWING the 200 meals being fed is MUCH better.\n\nAs an interim to this, we will begin manually tagging all payments \nfrom our public address to represent what is being paid for. We will also do a better job of streaming photos from daily operations via twitter @SeansOutpost\n\nWe are very proud of the level of service we have been able to provide. 125,000 meals is a lot. But when you look at the scope of the homeless problem in the US it doesn\'t even scratch the surface. 4.5 million meals are needed DAILY. There is simply no way to scale to that.\n\nAt #BitcoinDisney I announced that we had begun work on a separate project called "Outpost Everywhere" that intended to address this issue. The idea is "Uber for Soup Kitchens" a simple app with two buttons, "Give a meal." and "Get a meal." \n\nIf you have food to give, simply input how many meals you have and you will be geotagged as available. Need a meal? Press that button to see a list of the closest meals available to your location.\n\nNot only do we think this has a real shot actually making a difference in feeding the hungry, we think it will allow us to generate some of the most acurate analytics of the actual homeless problem ever.\n\nThis is a separate endeavor and is ENTIRELY self funded at this point. No Sean\'s Outpost funds are being used to fund development. The cost and time output is squarely on myself and my lead dev, Bryce Case, aka YT CRACKER.\n\nI think that\'s it. Sorry for spelling.

I could probably go on for pages as to why, but in summary, giving them shit doesn\'t make a difference. They still need to eat tomorrow. They still have no job. They still aren\'t doing anything about their situation. \n\nWhether the reason is alcoholism, laziness, drug addiction, or mental illness... It seems to me that just giving them shit all the time throws money down the drain, and does absolutely nothing to change their situation. It\'s like an endless black hole for money to dissappear into.  Always needing more. Never having enough. That\'s why I never could donate to Sean\'s outpost or any other homeless outreach.

It submitted applications to the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, or CFTC, which regulates U.S. futures and options exchanges, in late September to be approved as a derivatives exchange with bitcoin as the underlying asset to be traded, according to LedgerX co-founder and Chief Executive Paul Chou.\n\nSupporters of the company, which was started this year by former Goldman Sachs high-frequency traders and Massachusetts Institute of Technology-educated computer scientists, believe that a U.S.-regulated, U.S.-based futures exchange for bitcoin would settle down some of the volatility of bitcoin prices, give existing businesses that store and trade bitcoin an additional means to hedge their bets, and bring financial institutions who haven\xe2\x80\x99t been comfortable with bitcoin so far into the game.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s no different than with corn farmers,\xe2\x80\x9d said James Newsome, former chairman of the CFTC and former CEO of New York Mercantile Exchange, who is now on the board of directors at LedgerX. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99ve got all this corn, the grain markets have been volatile. They could enter into hedging contracts knowing exactly what it\xe2\x80\x99s worth, and not worrying about volatility.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLedgerX retained Mr. Newsome and his Washington lobbying firm Delta Strategy Group to help persuade the CFTC. Mr. Newsome said that Delta took an equity stake in the company in exchange for reduced rates for the work he does on its behalf. In addition to Mr. Newsome, LedgerX brought on Thomas Lewis, who served as CEO of Ameritrade Holding Corp. for a short stint and who is former CEO of Green Exchange Holdings LLC, to the board.\n\nA CFTC spokesman said that the agency doesn\xe2\x80\x99t comment on pending applications.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s something that I am anxious to see out there,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bryan Crohn, chief financial officer at BitPay Inc., speaking generally about the possibility of a regulated bitcoin derivatives exchange and not about LedgerX in particular.\n\nBitPay and others process roughly $2 million to $4 million in bitcoin transactions globally in aggregate every day, Mr. Crohn said. The processor holds the bitcoin and makes money by selling it at a higher price than where it was bought.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf the price is going down, I have nothing to minimize my downside risk,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Crohn said. All BitPay can do right now is hold bitcoin and wait for the price to increase, he said.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnce we have those options, those derivatives available, we would be hiring immediately an experienced trader to do just that,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Crohn said.\n\nA lot of work is ahead for LedgerX even before it launches, which is why the company has raised $4.5 million in seed and Series A financing. The Series A came this summer led by Lightspeed, according to Mr. Chou and Jeremy Liew, a partner at Lightspeed and a vocal supporter of bitcoin.\n\nBefore that, the company received seed funding from Google Ventures, as confirmed by a spokeswoman for that firm. SV Angel and Fenway Summer, a consumer finance advisory and investment firm, also participated in the seed round, Mr. Chou said.\n\nNow that the company has the capital it is trying to persuade the regulators to approve its efforts.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is new ground, there is no question,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Newsome said.\n\nMr. Newsome said that he has had several meetings with the staff at the CFTC to discuss LedgerX\xe2\x80\x99s applications. (It made two, one for a swap execution facility and the other for a derivatives clearing organization.)\n\nIn early October, the CFTC held a meeting to discuss whether the agency has jurisdiction over derivatives contracts that reference digital currencies.\n\nThere is some pressure on the CFTC and other regulators to start dealing with bitcoin, Mr. Newsome said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhether we like it or not, [bitcoin] is being used by legitimate companies as a form of currency. You can\xe2\x80\x99t keep your head in the sand and act like it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t exist.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIn addition, he said, regulators have a competitive streak to them, which might help LedgerX\xe2\x80\x99s application. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s apparent that there\xe2\x80\x99s going to be a regulated derivatives market that develops. Would you prefer that to happen in the U.S., or do you want that to migrate to London, Dubai or Hong Kong?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRegulators, he said, \xe2\x80\x9chave a fear of being left out.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBut getting LedgerX approved isn\xe2\x80\x99t simple. The company would have to prove to the agency that the underlying market, in this case bitcoin, isn\xe2\x80\x99t easily manipulated, Mr. Newsome said. It would have to also show that it is capable of operating an exchange and that it can establish sufficient surveillance of market makers to note when suspicious activity takes place.\n\nMr. Liew, of Lightspeed, said he realizes it\xe2\x80\x99s risky to put money into a company pre-launch whose business model is centered on getting government approval in a sector that has gotten none. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s venture risk,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Liew said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s possible that it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work out, but you find the people who have the best possible chance to do it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nWrite to Yuliya Chernova at yuliya.chernova@wsj.com.

MMAs are really poor investments right now, and carry non-zero risk as some aren\'t FDIC insured.\n\nYou\'d be smarter going with a high interest savings account, that currently pay around 1%.
