You don\'t need any hashing power at all to run this attack.\n\nHowever, such attack would be visible *if* observing the Bitcoin network.

Let\'s take 10% as an example. In this case he can mine the next block with a certain probability [10%], so the probability of succes of the attack after zero confirmations is 10%. He can revert 1 confirmation with a certain probability [1%]. He can revert 2 confirmations with an even lower probability [0.1%]. Etc. So after about 6 confirmation transactions are considered pretty safe from this sort of attack.\n\nThe third kind of double-spending attack does not require any hashing power but works by injecting two competing transactions from the same address into the Bitcoin network.

': 2, ">I don't like the idea of people burning bitcoin, but that's another issue.\n\nI think its a fabulous idea, as it can potentially solve the biggest problem with marketplaces like this, which is reputation farming. If a merchant has burned some portion of his BTC, then you know that he is dedicated to that account. \n\nBurning BTC allows the system to function from a game theory perspective.": 16, 'Im not an expert but I would try installing python 2.7 on your MAC': 1, 'Voluntary.': 3, 'There just needs to be a fully visible timeframe association with each account.

It should be\n completly free of any interference. The market itself will eradicate these and naive/uneducated customers will pay for their lack of due dilligence and be more vigilant next time.\n': 1, 'Awesome, thanks for setting that up!': 4, 'You are doing some really cool things, I hope it all pays off for you!': 8, "How about some way to index the market for people that don't have it installed (yet), with the buy button linking to the software download?\n\nIf that was included in the software, I would dedicate  a server to running it. It would of course need some report/NSFW/hide feature to run it on the open net.": 3, "I gave it a shot and sent in some bug reports. \n\nIt's way early.": 16, ">Why should an honest merchant burn any of his money when he can simply use ebay or set up his own shop?\n\nSeveral reasons. \n\n1) Ebay charges rediculous fee's. OpenBazaar merchants could burn a quarter of the price they'd pay to E-bay and paypal in fee's and gain significant reputation points, while still earning more than they would on E-bay.\n\n2) Ebay doesn't allow you to sell a lot of things, like illicit drugs for example\n\n>what makes you think an ill intended merchant won't find some very cleaver way to trick this reputation system to earn him way more money that he might have invested?\n\nBecause you cannot fake burned coins. Either you burned them or you didn't. A merchant can burn $1000 in a year by shaving small fractions off his sales and burning them. In two years, he can have $2000, or significantly more. In three years $3000. The merchant is burning a small amount, but over time it ads up very quickly. A scammer cannot do this, they will have to burn $1000 right now with a new account, try to get their review positive review count up, and then scam people, resulting in a complete loss of their burned coins. So they'll have to start over again, burning another $1000, but by this time, legitimate merchants now have $2000 burned, so the scammer now has to invest significantly more. \n\n>but logic suggests that it can only serve as a system for scammers to trick to their benefit and the great disadvantage to everyone else.\n\nNo, you have demonstrated absolutely no logic. Proof of Burn has been validated by game theory for a long time now. It's not new, and if you knew anything about game theory you'd know that. \n\nTLDR you don't know what you're talking about.": 5, 'You must be new here...\n\nDonations and a lot of volunteer work.': 2, "On your second point, we're not there yet... we're thinking we might have this feature ready for beta 2.0, but no promises.

Installation issues have to do with dependencies (one in particular, pysqlcipher that caused us hassles).\n2. After it is successfully installed, you open up *OpenBazaar* and find that you're not connected to any nodes, or the nodes you're connected to are just the seeds and you can't see anyone else and their storefront.\n  - most of the issues here have to do with port forwarding and setting up your router correctly\n3. Most of the nodes I've seen on the network don't have contracts that I can see... Which can be frustrating.\n\nThis is why they call it beta :)\n\n**Edit:** As of this morning, most of the nodes online have test contracts, well done guys!": 12, "So the scammer burns a bunch of BTC, and then scams some people, and his review ratings plummet and nobody trusts him anymore, and he now has to create a new account, and burn more BTC in the process. Legitimate merchants will have high user reviews, together with a significantly higher burn. \n\nsuccessful merchants stand to gain a lot by burning, as customers will gravitate toward those who have burned the most, and have high review scores.\n\nIf people are smart, they won't buy anything from somebody who has burned less money than the product they are purchasing. Ideally, the merchant will have burned significantly more. I'd feel very safe purchasing a $50 item from a merchant who had burned over $1,000.

The wallet itself will be tied to his reputation, so that if his reputation drops below a certain threshold the wallet is destroyed.
