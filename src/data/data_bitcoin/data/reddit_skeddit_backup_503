Is the token necessary, though? Given this specific use case where we don't need to create a permissionless, inclusionary system and are content with limiting access to the network to the devices a user has chosen to install in their home - does the token add value or remove it? I'd argue in this case a token might complicate things. ": 1, 'Ok, if you\'re parroting the same "Use a database" response that seems to be the fad, you lack understanding in two very important topics relevant to the conversation:\n1. What a database is and how it works\n2. What a blockchain is and how it works\n\nSo, lets assume most of you don\'t know better and are just repeating nonsense because you heard someone you think knows say it, and lets get into WHY it\'s actually nonsense.\n\nFirst off, what is a database?\n\nA database is a (centralized or non) storage center for data, modifiable, searchable, but most importantly,mutable. Meaning it can be changed. It can be altered. And every aspect of it, it\'s business logic, it\'s storage structure, is mutable, at any time, by anyone with sufficient permissions, and you cannot prove it was changed unless you are constantly monitoring it.\n\nA blockchain(as bitcoin implemented it) is a partially mutable transactional ledger based on discrete nonduplicatable units.  In laymens terms, it uses items that can\'t be altered, but can be divided, and passes them around different accounts. The records themselves can be altered if you control sufficient consensus and power determined by whatever algorithm it uses, but the items cannot. The logic the blockchain uses cannot be modified without modifying the nodes participating, so there is proof of any logic change.\n\nSo in other words, what can a blockchain do that a database cannot?\n\nA database\'s logic is mutable. Not only can it change, but it cannot be verified to be correct on every transaction to prove it functioned correctly and wasn\'t changed then changed back.  Not without incuring significant overhead to record and sign checksums and a proof of run on any computation.  And in the event of a race condition, there\'s no guarantee (without redoing the calculations and checking associated data) which one ran correctly or even if one did.\n\nA database cannot guarantee an item cannot be duplicated.  You can put in restrictions, conventions, business logic and even rules on how to use it, but there is no guarantee that those will be followed. \n\nA database cannot be proven true.  You can add proving mechanisms into it such as signing, timestamping, replication and verification, but those are not default to the database. And since the database is mutable in all aspects, those can still be questioned if not implemented perfectly.\n\n\n\nSo, the biggest argument i\'ve heard is a database is more efficient. It is more efficient at storing data, sure, but that\'s not why the blockchain technology is interesting.   The database is not more efficient at storing nonduplicatable, provable discrete units where a given set of transactional rules have been applied.\n\nNow we\'ll go onto the next favorite argument: But there\'s no incentive to secure the network!  Guess what? You don\'t have to!  This is a hard concept to grasp, so hear it out.\n\nThe reason bitcoin relies on a blockchain secured through proof of work, is that it does not want to have any administrative overhead to deal with bad actors such as those who try to doublespend, secure block majority, etc.    Satoshi wanted a self-sufficient system that people could use psuedononymously that had no barrier to entry.   \n\nNow, if you have a relatively closed system, such as the inter-bank network, then the barrier to entry is relatively high, and any bad-actor can be detected in relatively short order and ejected because of the provability of the blockchain. Likewise, if you are willing to incur a little oversight, you can reverse any transactions made in bad faith through use of an administrative key to declare a checkpoint in the blockchain.  \n\nA blockchain does not need bitcoin to function. The bitcoin blockchain needs bitcoin to function, because that is how it was designed to work and accomplish it\'s intended goals. The goals of a banking blockchain would be entirely different.\n\n\nNow, if you\'ve followed me up to here, you\'re probably thinking, "Ok, wall of text, but what good does a banking blockchain do?".\n\nIt eliminates trust of competence and allows accountability and audibility. \n\nIt eliminates the need to trust that every access to your ledger is done by competent entities who make sure to fully understanding how the ledger works and make all the appropriate updates, using the appropriate logic, and don\'t duplicate anything. Basically, you don\'t have to trust that everyone does their math right and no one unauthorized creates units out of thin air without detection, because they are provably correct and verifiable by all participating entities.  And any new coins created are instantly detectable and provable.\n\nYou never have to worry about state corruption, about synchronizing at a certain time, about race conditions(double spends are not race conditions, but intentional data manipulation, which you have the risk of in a DBMS as well).  Unlike race conditions, double spends are verifiable after the fact, provable which one was processed, and provable what state the other one was left in. So even in the event of a double spend in a blockchain vs a malicious entry in a dbms, you can recover MUCH easier in a blockchain.\n\nSo yeah:\nYou have to trust people whether you use a dbms, or a blockchain.\nBut with a blockchain, you can trust people less because if they are bad actors, you have proof of what they tried to do and how to fix it.\nYou can also trust people less because you know a bad actor cannot create units through data maniuplation, only creating bad transactions.\nYou can also trust people less because all computations are verifiable, so you don\'t have to trust they implemented it correctly, or that all transfers went correctly, because if they don\'t then they don\'t go through at all.\n\nCould you build a DBMS that provides most of these features? Sure. But it won\'t be as efficient, and it will use some of the technology the blockchain pioneered to do it, since some of the signing and ledger verification algorithms really were novel and advanced the state of the art. You still have to trust the dbms\'s logic, whereas the blockchain\'s logic is provable, verifiable after the fact that it was what ran, and change-detectable.\n\nHope that clears things up!': 17, 'What about credit ([as I explained](https://pay.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/31qdbc/please_show_me_arguments_in_favour_of_blockchain/cq4aejk))?': 1, "Changing the POW algorithm from btcs SHA(SHA()) to maybe SHA SHA + 1 or something could be used to create a pretty exact copy of bitcoin that the current miners couldn't mine (do to problem change), if the banks restricted use of this to just themselves it would be a centralized blockchain.\n\nThe other options I can think of would be a TTP or a centralized database with some sort of merkle tree thing kind of like btc ": 1, 'Not sure I have an argument, but I do have an application: \n\nI use Twister everyday which utilizes a blockchain to propagates usernames and public keys.

A variant of that question might have been fairly reasonable to ask at some obscure point in history. The fact is, though, that without some value that the combined technologies of paper and print are meant to represent, you are just left with pieces of paper with fancy pictures drawn on them. A blockchain without value is like a banknote without value, and when people talk about blockchain without Bitcoin, what they are really talking about is a blockchain without any value (or in some cases they are talking about an alt coin, which to extend the analogy is like talking about using paper notes to represent other currencies than the dollar.

Corporations are soul-less and moral-less, but they aren\'t stupid. They will always try to make the most profitable decision.\nA company\'s best interest isn\'t to hide mistakes and messes. That\'s damage control, the best thing to do after the mistake has happened.  You know what a company\'s best interest is? Not making messes in the first place. That\'s why companies have audit  departments.  Audit is there to catch small mistakes before they turn into big ones.  Yes it catches intentional bad eggs, but most of audit\'s job is just verifying everyone else\'s work to make sure everyone\'s on track.  You\'d be surprised how much money a good audit department can save a company just by catching that someone accidentally put in a wrong value on a quarterly report before it goes into the grand ledger. And thereby avoiding the mistake entirely.\n\n  And this helps that. Not only from within their company, but from within their interactions with other companies.  You no longer have to worry that company B sends the right wire transfer to company C, and then you have to deal with company C if something is malformed because B says it\'s out of their hands with C.  You kno longer have to jump to a couple different places to find out exactly what went wrong, was the wire sent twice, or just processed twice? \n\nBasically think of a blockchain as a really good defense against both human errors in your own workers/systems, and outside entities ability to get away with things contrary to agreement either intentionally or on accident.\n\nIt\'s easy to believe a company wants to hide things, but usually that\'s only really poorly run companies.  A good company sets up their business such that what they\'re doing is blatantly obvious, so it can\'t come back to bite them because that\'s a needless risk.  That\'s why legal is such a huge department as well, they make sure they structure their agreements to benefit them the most, while avoiding what others try to sneak in, with the end result being a safe result for both companies just because they can\'t get anything through the other side\'s legal. It\'s not always "nice", but it is profitable.\n\nTl:dr - Companies want profit, auditability saves lost profits, and hiding things risks losing profits.

Both great. The former with a capital \'G\' and the latter with an unemphatic shrug.\n\nBitcoin is a peer to peer network for the transfer of value. It is a creative combination of several related innovations. The major unique contributions of Satoshi Nakamoto to the field were (1) the use of proof of work to ensure that labour was required to \'mint\' each unit of value in a distributed database and (2) the application of an open market to find an optimal solution for \'trusted\' transaction processing instead of using designated third parties. \n\nThese two innovations produced three very cool things: digital scarcity (copy+paste be damned); non-institutional scarcity (lemme just email this gold bullion kthx); and an open financial database that, like the internet and all open protocols, allows innovation without permission ("We don\'t want people opening banks out of their garage." - Ben Lawsky... well, actually we do and Bitcoin let\'s that work).\n\nAll that being said, the blockchain has a number of very valuable properties. Removing its \'trustless\' properties still leaves many of its advantages as a secure, distributed, programmatic database of value - bearing in mind that you\'re still making a trade-off between efficiency and control. This is like an internal or intra-organisational network. It\'s not the internet writ large, but it\'s useful perhaps to the point of necessary. \n\nThen, say we add (sort of) turing-complete smart contracting and now we have a lot of uses for a centralised blockchain.

You are clearly a competent enough programmer to be exploring the issue, but you believe that a blockchain is a computer science problem, and not an economic problem, which is leading you astray. \n\nThe core thing you're wrong about is that miners can secure a chain absent payment. This is impossible in the long term, though PHB's will blow a lot of money in the short term learning this lesson. In an environment where trust amongst actors is low, absent a center of authority, 'stake' (external to the history of the data) simply must be burned. A lot of it. That's what keeps the 'truth' in check. If you're in an environment where actors cannot trust a central clearinghouse, then a Blockchain *may* be useful. However, the only way security can be maintained is if either : \n\n1. Each of those offices/participants are perpetually engaged in a war of attrition, thus anchoring 'state' to 'stake' at regular intervals. (10 minutes in the case of Bitcoin) \n2. You leverage the Bitcoin blockchain as your transit, and in turn you leverage the Bitcoin blockchain's war of attrition for the reasons in 1.\n\nIt seems that you believe compensation is not necessary for stake burners. Maybe you're correct, but I doubt it. When a PHB looks at his energy bill every month, and someone tells him he can cut that down to nearly '0' by just using the Bitcoin blockchain, that PHB will choose the path of '0'. If you suggest that no stake is required to be burned, you have all of the nothing at stake problems, and the Blockchain can be forked by a bad actor for a very low fee, at any time.\n\nFurther, you seem to believe that pubilc key cryptography somehow requires a blockchain... it does not. There are many ways to sign-off on provable updates to a persistence layer using centralized databases. It's not a terribly popular thing to do, because people typically trust their own infrastructure, but you see it used in projects like git. (and package management systems)\n\nIMO, The big problem we have in this Blockchain-all-the-things dialog is that there's a new generation of programmers who haven't heard of journaling or quorum-based replication, and believe these are innovations provided by a Blockchain. They are not, these innovations have been around since the 80's. (maybe 70's even). Quorum-based replication is generally not popular because it's inefficient, but plenty of systems use it. Journaling is massively popular, and it's a mystery to me why anyone would claim that a traditional DBMS doesn't offer this functionality, other than it's so automatic that they probably don't realize it's happening.\n\nThe last thing people need to realize about Blockchains, is that they probably won't work for most database functions for the simple reason that state is maintained by all parties. If security is a goal....why store your data on all your enemies' computers?

But it\'s an interesting point. I haven\'t given much thought to whether or not a \'token\' is some sort of core axiom to which all other concepts can be mapped.\n\nWhat about a situation where  all participants benefit by having a working ledger/message database. They\'re incented to mine as that\'s the only way to *guarantee* their messages are added to the ledger in a timely fashion - but they\'re also incented to include the messages of others into the ledger since bidirection communication is a requirement for their specific appliction (e.g. IoT devices communicating within a household and using a "decentralized" ledger to handle communication amongst them - they all benefit by sending/receiving messages and all are incented to mine new blocks).\n\nIn this case the incentive isn\'t a token, but it\'s the ability to participate in a functioning, purpose-driven ecosystem.': 1, 'TL:DR - If you ignore the premises of my initial post and put in your own assumptions which i already rejected, then yes your post could be right about a completely different topic than what we were discussing. \n\n>In an environment where trust amongst actors is low, absent a center of authority\n\nSo in other words, completely ignoring the premise of a banking blockchain( that requires less oversight than a database while providing a system that allows less trust between actors than a database) and pretending it\'s a bitcoin blockchain without oversight.\n\n>If you\'re in an environment where actors cannot trust a central clearinghouse, then a Blockchain may be useful.\n\nExcept the whole point of what I listed was that actors do trust a central clearinghouse(that\'s their job), and the clearinghouse on the whole trusts the actors (or else a database wouldn\'t work at all). A blockchain just allows LESS trust than it\'s database alternative for the same efficiency level, and therefore less oversight, and therefore less potential issues.  To implement most of these features on a database, while doable, would add maintenance, oversight, and efficiency losses.\n\n>Further, you seem to believe that pubilc key cryptography somehow requires a blockchain... it does not. \n\nI\'m pretty sure that\'s the exact opposite of what I stated, because i pointed out that while you could implement many of the features of a blockchain on a database using existing technologies such as public key signing you would take an efficiency hit as they\'re not native to the database structure, and are mutable logic that cannot be verified by actors not in possession of the central database\n\n>When a PHB looks at his energy bill every month, and someone tells him he can cut that down to nearly \'0\' by just using the Bitcoin blockchain, that PHB will choose the path of \'0\'.\n\nExcept you\'re comparing using a blockchain to using a database, which is definitely not cost 0.  The argument was, a database designed to offer the same features the blockchain provides natively, will cost more upkeep and be less secure than a properly constructed blockchain suited to those purposes. You keep trying to tie your arguments back to the bitcoin blockchain specifically which has entirely different design parameters than what we were discussing\n\n>and the Blockchain can be forked by a bad actor for a very low fee, at any time.\nA very low fee of gaining access and credentials to a relatively secure system, and performing a fork that is quickly detectable and easily reversible for much less overhead than doing the same monitoring on the central database it would be replacing due to the fact that a blockchain has nonduplicatable units while a database cannot ensure data is not altered asymmetrically without massive overhead due to additional checks and even then could miss some due to the non-chain nature of database entries. It is easy to see what changes are made in a dbms, it is harder to perform logic to declare all changes are done in accordance at all times after the fact.\n\n>IMO, The big problem we have in this Blockchain-all-the-things dialog is that there\'s a new generation of programmers who haven\'t heard of journaling or quorum-based replication, and believe these are innovations provided by a Blockchain. \n\nNo, the problem we have is idiots trying to use a hammer in place of a screwdriver and then getting onto people for not using the hammer.  Journaling verifies data points and changes in history through active logging, Quorum replication ensures integrity of that data through slow broadcast of results.  Which exists on both blockchain and database, and wasn\'t even mentioned as an advantage in my original post, so lets not derail on tangents.  Or did you mean this to be a rebuttal to the points that a blockchain allows both verification and validation of logic used to process, and that it is resistant to changes to either?  Because journaling and quorum only provide verification, not validation, and is not even change detectable unless you are declaring that every database node in your network that touches your central database is in quroum to every other one to validate each individual participants implementations of the interface.\n\n> The last thing people need to realize about Blockchains, is that they probably won\'t work for most database functions for the simple reason that state is maintained by all parties. If security is a goal....why store your data on all your enemies\' computers?\nIf you are relying on security through obscurity for public transactions through a central banking ledger, you have a great misunderstanding of the point of security.  Your argument literally says, if we apply it\'s context to the argument of a database vs blockchain for a central bank, "If security is your goal, why store all your transaction data in a public ledger on all participants in the network? You should instead store it on a cluster of databases controlled by the central authority that any participant can query and see the data anyway." Since the whole point of the hypothetical discussion was a blockchain for resolving inter-bank transfers and whether it\'d be better than a database. Not whether you\'re storing proprietary secret company financial records on payments from the r&d department to the billing department internally. But your public transactions to other banks. \n\n>\'Why give attackers the ability to read all your data just by grabbing a single participant\'s 8 byte key? Wouldn\'t it be more useful to have logins that can be audited and disabled?\'\n\nYou\'re confusing proactive security with reactive security and making a false comparison.   To phrase your question to use the same reference frame in both halves, "Why secure your data with a method attackers only have to break one key to get to. Wouldn\'t it be more useful to secure your data with a method attackers only have to break one key to get to that you can disable once you find out?"\n\nAt the point they\'ve broken your keys whether it\'s an encryption or a login you can disable, they have your data. Period.  Disabling after the fact is irrelevant and only matters to prevent using the same method to grab future changes, which can be done by changing encryption keys, what a novel concept! They both work the same!\n\nBut again, that\'s irrelevant to this conversation because you keep trying to put forward the false premise that people are storing private super secret data in this public ledger, and that they would do that in a central banking clearing house.\n\nThe only way you can make that argument relevant to this discussion is by saying "Well bank c doesn\'t need to know bank a and b traded money" in which case i\'d say you\'re pulling at straws and not understanding what exactly a clearinghouse does and mistakenly believe clearinghouses deal in secret data, in which case you wouldn\'t use a central database anyway, you\'d use locked down portals that then talk to a central database, which is an entirely different use case.\n': 1, '> A distributed blockchain with proof of work MUST be tied to a reward.\n\nBut the value of the reward doesn\'t have to be internal to the blockchain itself.  Let me give an example:\n\nThere is obvious value in secure records of property ownership, business contracts, and creative works.  An association forms for the purpose of keeping such records.  They collect fees from people for incorporating the records into a block chain.  They pay out some of the fees to miners for finding block hashes.  The level of trust here is that of operating a bitcoin mining pool.  As long as the payouts happen on schedule, everyone is happy.  \n\nThe blockchain is distributed because there are many miners, including some of the association members.  If what you want is a "distributed, trustless blockchain", then the reward needs to be internal to the chain.  But that is different than just being distributed.  You can achieve distributed with some level of trust, as the existence of mining pools demonstrates.  It\'s a low level of trust, because as soon as payouts stop happening, everyone will know and leave.\n\n': 3, 'Heh.': 1, 'hyperledger': 3, 'I think they mean not using the tokens as the currency, but more like colored coins.\n\nMaybe "blockchain without stupid people needing to understand the details, and painting it over to look like dollars" or something like that.': 3, 'You\'re right about one thing, even mainstream economists are being forced to face the lies they were told in college by the Keynesian "scholars."

': 5, 'Here\'s how a blockchain without its own token (e.g. bitcoins) can be useful for distributed consensus for things other than a currency. Instead of its own token it could use *credit* issued by anyone (individuals, banks, etc.) for payment of mining fees. A blockchain is simply not needed if you only wanted to transfer value, since you could simply transfer credit to the recipient. But for other distributed consensus uses it makes sense. The transfer of credit (as fees to the miner) can happen even outside the blockchain. It can happen with the credit issuer\'s help like this:\n\n* Alice wants to post a transaction to the blockchain.\n* Bob is willing to credit Alice (e.g. Alice has a deposit or credit line at Bob\'s fiat bank; or Bob is the custodian of Alice\'s gold).\n* Mike offers mining services.\n\nAlice sends Mike (1) transaction data to be included in the blockchain; and (2) a signed order for Bob to transfer credit from Alice\'s account to Mike\'s account when transaction (1) is confirmed in the blockchain. If Mike is satisfied with the fee he mines the transaction (1) and sends (2) to Bob. When Bob sees (2) he waits for (1) to be confirmed and then executes (2), paying Mike.\n\nThis is a bit simplified - you would want a few more steps like Alice asking Bob to certify to Mike that Alice has sufficient credit/funds in her account and to encumber that amount until the transaction (1) is confirmed. Then Mike doesn\'t have to trust Alice at all.\n\nHow can Mike deal with the need for trust in the credit issuers (Bob)? The same way it happens in finance today. Credit is discounted at a certain market rate which depends on Bob\'s risk of default. Mike can further reduce risk by hedging, converting, asking for immediate delivery/settlement, etc.\n\nThe role of Alice and Bob may also be played by the same person/entity.\n\nNote: this scheme requires the same kind of market for mining fees as the one which Bitcoin will have to use when the mining subsidy (creation of new bitcoins) diminishes and disappears.\n\nWhy would you want to have such a scheme? To have the ability to pay directly with many traditional methods and instruments and issuers. Those can provide lower volatility than bitcoin over relatively long periods of time.\n\nWhat would such a blockchain be useful for if not for currency? Check all the proposed uses for a blockchain - basically notarizing things and putting them in a chronological order.\n\nWill it work well in practice? Credit brings weaknesses. Creditors can be controlled, and through them - miners can be controlled too. While under a credit system there can be long periods of very low volatility, there can be extremely rare "black swan events" of extreme volatility which can compromise miner incentives.\n\nWell, you asked us to play the devil\'s advocate and that\'s what you get.': 3, "There are potential applications where the blockchain is used to manage non-currency assets (such as stocks) and merge mined with another blockchain (such as Bitcoin), with users paying transaction fees indirectly to motivate miners. \n\nNo idea how anyone thinks a free blockchain would work, unless they're centralising ": 2, 'My stance is that an optimal currency is deflationary.

One of the things I found interesting was the whole concept of preserving the value of sold work: every contract she signed with a gallery included clauses that her work was to always be sold in the future for the same value (or more) as it was to sold for at present. It was okay to increase prices of her work, but as soon as a piece sold she contractually was not allowed to ever sell a similar piece for less than the price of that sale, as it would devalue the previous purchaser's piece.\n\nThis brings up an interesting point: how would this work with a volatile currency? With your wife pricing things in Bitcoin, which fluctuates in value, would a gallery view this as a breach of the maintenance of value clause if the price crashed between the sale of two similar pieces? I actually find this interesting. \n\nGranted, this only effects a very, very small percentage of the artist population, but I'm super curious as to how it would work. Like even outside of Bitcoin, what happened to artists who sold their work in both USD and the Ruble as the Ruble fell in value? Would the artist be forced to continually change the Ruble price to ensure the value of the purchase price was the same? Would an international artist need to increase their prices in currencies that were falling in value if a similar piece had previously sold in a currency that remained stable?\n\nTl:Dr: The art world is weird and fascinating.

And if you have an on-network/built-in currency, why would you use it as a *proxy* for a different, centrally controlled, and inflationary currency?\n\nMy only point was that the analogy works.  Bitcoin tokens are the fuel that keep the network going.  Responding to arguments that say they aren\'t necessary is not circlejerking and happens to be a worthwhile debate. As is the debate that it will stay around but not be widely used as currency.  I\'m inclined to think it will be, but id like to hear other arguments.': 1, "The blockchain *is* a combustion engine.

I mean, I specifically wrote this post about Bitreserve, a company COMPLETELY built on top of the bitcoin. And this thread popped up just after these comments were made by a new Bitreserve employee. They have no idea about how bitcoin works?\n\nGive me a break. Look, they may not be as visionary as an armchair anarchist, a big-betting VC fund or a crypto enthusiast like Andreas Antonopolous. I agree. They're a business, not economics philosophers. \n\nBut they've built an entire business on top of the blockchain, they're one of the very few if not only companies that are 100% transparent about every single penny of user funds they have, stored on the blockchain, through some clever innovations and a radical notion of voluntary complete transparency that you can check on their website and get from their API. The notion they're 'just ignorant' about bitcoin is a huge claim that hasn't been justified.\n\nSure, if you're talking about a journalist at the WSJ that copy/pastes some silly comments, fine I agree. There's a lot of ignorance out there. I agree with you 100%\n\nBut this thread (and all the other ones) that's been on the front page the past day wasn't in response to that, but in response to the ex-CIO of Nike, now at Bitreserve, making comments on how they think bitcoin as a currency will fade away while bitcoins as the tokens that act as a store of value and power oil, gold, commodities, currencies etc, will thrive (which their entire business is based on). You may disagree with their vision, but you can't dismiss it with a silly analogy that completely misunderstands their point.": 1, "Except they aren't. Many oil engines use liquid phase of fuels due to low vapor points. Hell, there's also ICE's that run on solid phase fuels such as metal powders. I take it you're not a mechanical engineer are you dumbass? ": -3, "I agree, if bitcoin works well as a system of tokens powering other things, like say the transmission of dollar-expressed values, then it could indeed move to become a currency after that. But that's a really long-term view that doesn't happen overnight. A bit like how we've had digital files for more than twice as long as I've been alive, yet my home is still full of physical books, mail, articles etc. Technology moves extremely fast, but culture can sometimes persist for much longer. I mean hell, most transactions in modern economies are still using cash, despite cards being generally faster, easier and more secure for decades. I think people here who are bitcoin enthusiasts seem to underestimate how disinterested people are in using currencies they didn't grow up with, or aren't familiar with, in which product prices aren't expressed, that only exist in a digital form. I think it's quite sensible to expect bitcoin to work as a token first for powering value transmission of things we're already familiar with. If and when, inevitably, people get more accustomed to the idea of digital money, and bitcoin scales, becomes less volatile etc, then it's entirely conceivable that it'll also be used as a currency directly but that'd be a long game. At least according to this whole way of thinking. I generally lean towards small, slow but continual growing use of bitcoin as a currency, with some big leaps - especially if a currency, say the Euro, gets into trouble or another bubble pops and a crisis emerges, as happens every 15 years or so - as being the most likely future.": 0, 'Aren\'t we supposed to have flying cars by now?  But seriously, there will always be outliers, but I think people transacting directly in Bitcoin is the last thing about Bitcoin to achieve mainstream adoption. All the other "making b2b work faster" and immutable data storage and remittance stuff will probably happen first. And yeah it will be slow, but value will be priced in long before mainstream adoption occurs, which could even be next year if we have a massive avalanche of investor confidence.': 1, "Except. \n\n.1. *Blockchain security is proportional to coin value*.
