": 1, 'Whats an XCP?': 3, "I know that they are different but I have trouble wrapping my head around it, can some one explain to me the major core differences between counterparty, Mastercoin, and colored coins?\n\nIs counterparty the only one that uses OP_Return? \n\nIf I create an asset on CP, and I send it to someone else, is this basically a btc transaction that counterwallet will see differently and interpret is as the asset moving from one wallet to another? If you issue dividends, are those bitcoin transactions only recognized by counterwallet? \n\nEdit: why the downvote? Not everyone is an expert in this stuff I am trying to understand, it's interesting to me. (If it came off as sarcasm it's not)": 4, 'Counterparty has its own database that is built by scanning the Bitcoin block chain. The first transactions that made it into that database and were encoded into Bitcoin transactions were payments to the proof-of-burn address. When the counterpartyd software saw those payments and that they happened within the burn period, it imbued the sending address for each payment with a certain amount of XCP. From the, the XCP, all the other tokens, broadcasts, orders and everything else have been tracked just as bitcoin itself is. Via protocol.': 3, "You means the proof of burn launch? Burning money is not burning purchasing power, just moving it around. If I send my gold into outer space everyone else's gold will be worth more, so I'm basically donating some of my purchasing power to every other gold owner. All the actual stuff in the economy is still there, I've just given up my claim to some of it, leaving that much more for everyone else.\n": 1, "Counterparty can be used for betting and gambling.\n\nColored coins can't (or rather there is no core support for it) but are closer to how bitcoin works, so they can use SPV, you can accept unconfirmed transactions, you can use coin mixers for anonymity, and you can use micropayment channels for fast, trustless and cheap transactions. None of this can work with CP. Colored coins also is not tied to a meta-coin like XCP.\n\nThe colored coin protocols are defined once and then placed in public domain, much like the W3C standards. The Counterparty protocol on the other hand is defined by whatever code is put in counterpartyd, so now overstock has basically bought the ability to add/remove features, change fees and break compatibility at will.\n\nMastercoin is like counterparty, but with less features.": 2, "HFT is down to microseconds. The first gox'ing happened because mt gox couldn't handle more than 1 trade per second; for a tiny market cap like Bitcoin, it made it easy to cause a flash crash. Counterparty will be roughly 600x slower than that. I think that's a problem they need to solve before its too late.": 1, 'colored coins please.': 2, '> there is no possibility that an asset can get uncolored because of using the wrong wallet.\n\nThis is something that could be solved if colored coins wallet used a different representation of bitcoin addresses for sending colored coins. Then colored coin wallets would refuse to send the colored coins to a "legacy" address.\n\nWhat\'s bothering with counterparty is that there is no guarantee that it won\'t be changed in an unfavourable way in the future. Whatever gets submitted in the counterpartyd code is what becomes official. Now that overstock "bought" one of the dev, they will try to push changes they want to the code. They very well could decide to increase fees, disable features like betting because it\'s not good for the SEC, etc... nobody really knows. I am not saying they will, but the lack of guarantee of what the protocol will be in the future is a risk. Sure you can fork it if things go south, but do you really want to try to compete against overstock?\n\nColored coins / open asset is a plain-english specification, placed in the public domain, and has no economic constant whatsoever (like fees).': 1, "You are right, but then the broker could do the same thing for free with colored coins and OT contracts: all the advantages of on-chain trading go away at that point. \n\nOn-chain trading has other limitations besides speed, like the inability to reliably cancel an order once you broadcast it. I'm concerned that could lead to some serious gox'ing.": 2, "Well.... XCP is used for issuing and some other functionality like betting, but I like the idea of being able to issue assets for free. You say that $2 isn't a barrier, but when we talk about widespread tokenization it very well could be. Colored coin has all of Bitcoin's functionality with respect to multisig etc, and also supports atomic swaps which is the most widely used type of contract and the basis of distributed exchange. I also think more complicated contracts are going to be done by software agents, distributed or otherwise,which is a problem domain outside of asset issuance.  I think my problem with XCP and Mastercoin is the kitchen sink approach. A solid assets system with widespread exchange integration is all we need and we don't need to have an intermediary currency to do it. ": 1, "I am very interested in what Open Assets / Colored Coin is doing, and I like that it is free and lets us discuss it without the fandom associated with being invested in meta/alt coins\n\nbut colored coin still is lacking a lot and may have some serious limitations with tracing color in the blockchain efficiently\n\nlets just avoid getting derailed with mastercoin, it sucks and is not necessary.\n\ncounterparty on the other hand has a lot of utility, today. there is no possibility that an asset can get uncolored because of using the wrong wallet. it is a huge step forward in asset issuance, a process that still costs upwards of hundreds of thousands of dollars in fiat, being leapfrogged for something that is the equivalent of $2 at *today's* exchange rate. sure XCP can be a deflationary asset, but there is also enough utility in it as well to keep it in circulation. but again this is a future problem for future issuers that will have to raise capital, the old exchange Bitcoin Global had a profitable deflationary asset issuing process so I've seen this before, and companies found a way. \n\nI can also see one scenario where colored coin is like the OTC markets and counterparty is like the Nasdaq\n\nbut so many possibilities": 2, 'Great answer, that makes sense, thanks!': 1, 'counterparty pump coming??': 2, "So with respect to uncoloring is this  true? If I take a counterparty asset and send it to bitcoind, and then send it back into counterparty doesnt the tracking stop and the whole thing break? I think that there are safeguards meant to stop this from happening built into the client, but conceptually is has the same problem as colored coin. Colored coin can't get uncolored on receive, only on spend. \n\nIts exciting stuff for sure, I want to best solution to win, but either way there are a lot of possibilities in the space.": 3, 'revenues or bitcoin revenues?': 2, "As far as I can tell there are no advantages to using counterparty over colored coins for stock trading. Counterparty trades are limited to the blockchain solve rate, so I'm not seeing how they're going to take over Wall Street. They've got great marketing, though.": 1, 'Yes, and also advocating for it :)': 0, "Counterparty has support for betting and rock-paper-scissors, whereas colored coins don't.\n\nBut overstock will probably have these features disabled or removed as this won't sit well with the SEC.": 3, 'To be clear, are you requesting I research and do a similar writeup? ': 1, "Conterparty doesn't work with micropayment channels because it doesn't use Bitcoin's native double-spend prevention mechanism. Colored coins can though.": 2, "Counterparty the protocol is a way to layer more complicated financial transactions on top of Bitcoin and other block chains.\n\nAs far as the proof-of-burn goes, if you don't have mining to distribute a currency, you have to figure out another way to initialize the balances of participants. This is the fairest way to do so, since people are spending something of value to create another thing. Whether that other thing is valued and by how much is ultimately up to the market to decide. If there is any criticism that could be made of XCP, it's that the burn period was too short. Then again, how long do people who will risk funds on a new project need to find such a project?": 3, "The $2 it takes to buy 0.5 XCP is all that's required to issue a new stock. It's just an anti-spam fee; the amount is burned and it wasn't intended to be cost-prohibitive.\n\nXCP's primary utility comes from distributed Intrade prediction market activity, [sports betting](http://betxcp.com), and derivatives trading. None of which pertains all that much to issuing and trading stock.\n\nIncredible that Overstock is devoting 5% of their revenues to developing Counterparty and Medici. Consider me awestruck.": 3, "If you wouldn't mind, I would be interested in that as well. Great job. I would also throw Mastercoin in the mix as well. ": 1, 'So how does it use the blockchain if it has its own altcoin?': 1, "I read this and scratched my head for a bit.  I checked out the code and to be specific what it looks like it is creating a p2sh transaction with a non standard redeem script.\n\nThis means it isn't compatible with Bitcoin  multi-signature. The standard client can't construct the redeem script. I'm not sure why they did it this way, although I could speculate. Anyone who has spent more than 1 minute looking at it care to comment?": 1, 'as someone that used to be emotionally invested in colored coins, conceptually, and hated tertiary coins like Mastercoin, I realized that counterparty is better.\n\nboth colored coins and counterparty use the blockchain, and for people actually interested in owning shares and assets - neither require any altcoin, only bitcoin. XCP is used for ISSUING an asset "anti-spam protection" as they say, and XCP exists in abundance, costs $2 to launch a stock or asset. That\'s fine, this isn\'t a drawback.\n\nmore complicated contracts also require XCP, and colored coins cannot do these things.': 5, "I don't think he's saying Intrade did, but their functionality is possible in Counterparty.": 2, 'The Bitcoin tip for 1500 bits ($0.51) has been collected by *dsterry*.\n\n\n[ChangeTip info](https://www.changetip.com/tip-online/reddit) | [ChangeTip video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AnfKpypMNw) | /r/Bitcoin': 1, "I'm curious though.. can one XCP be used to issue an unlimited number of shares / tokens.. or is there some sort of limit?": 3, "You are right. Counterparty can use open transactions to do high speed off chain trading. I guess I don't see what their value proposition is: if they are targeting wall street then you need to be off chain for speed anyway, in which case you can use colored coins and OT contracts. If they are targeting small businesses or developing countries then the price of issuance becomes a barrier to entry that grows with adoption.": 3, 'The weakness of counterparty is that you cant do more than one trade per 10 minutes, since trades are tied to bitcoin solve rate.

When you destroy it, there\'s no going back, and everyone burning the stake should participate.\n\nIt\'s like bitcoin, when we cash in fiat, it\'s our best interest to make it reality.\n\nSo mastercoin could be lazy because if it does not work, they can send btc backs to holders.\n\nBut the "purchase" model, like ethereum, or other scam coins is even worse. There is nothing saying the organizations will return back precious btc, if it fails.': 3, "If you send a Counterparty asset to bitcoind, bitcoind won't know how to send it out again unless you also install counterpartyd to talk to that bitcoind. The more likely way to get assets back out of that wallet is to dumpprivkey the private key for the address holding the asset and sweep that address into Counterwallet.\n\nBasically, the way assets get sent is via specially constructed Bitcoin transactions that bitcoind doesn't know how to construct itself.": 1, "Noob here. Do you know why callable assets are denominated in XCP? If I want the ability to buy a share back at double it's BTC market value, is there a way to do that?": 1, "The fee is 0.5 XCP which is currently 0.004 BTC to issue an asset. After that point, you don't have to buy any more XCP. The utility of XCP comes when bets, contracts-for-difference or trustless trading want to be used. The first two of those must be settled in XCP while the latter would most likely use XCP if it is the Counterparty-native token with the most liquidity.": 2, "The plan was to use OP_RETURN to encode this data. For now, multisig is used because pools controlling a large fraction of hashpower are not mining OP_RETURN transactions. There was another wrench thrown in when OP_RETURN was limited to 40 bytes from the originally specified 80 bytes but this was worked around so it's just waiting for consistent support from I think 90% plus of pools for OP_RETURN.\n\nEdit: As far as redeeming those outputs, I believe there is a tool that will do it, just not in bitcoind.": 1, "If I want to issue stocks of my company, do I need to buy into an alt-coin that is traded freely against bitcoin? In other words, is there an early adopter advantage of buying into a system that is not yet used as a stock tool?\n\nIf so, what is the advantage over colored coins that according to my understanding don't have this speculative aspect.": 3, "I'm sorry, but what is the benefit of Counterparty? I don't understand how destroying money would make money worth more. ": 2, "> Surely, Counterparty trades can be done off blockchain as well, with the blockchain acting as a checkpoint (i.e. close the off-chain books every ten minutes).\n\nYou can't do it in a trustless way with CP. With colored coins, you can have the two parties negotiate off-chain an atomic swap transaction. Because it's atomic, it doesn't require trust at all.": -1, "Maybe I am misunderstanding, but it sounds like you are saying that the weakness of Counterparty is that it's done on the blockchain, where as Colored Coin trading is done off blockchain. \n\nSurely, Counterparty trades can be done off blockchain as well, with the blockchain acting as a checkpoint (i.e. close the off-chain books every ten minutes).": 3, 'I like colored coins much more ': 1, 'Counterparty and Mastercoin are very similar in that they encode transactions in the block chain and additional software interprets those transactions to build the current state of Counterparty or Mastercoin respectively. Colored coins attach extra data to unspent outputs that may or may not be preserved when those outputs are spent. For me, XCP and Mastercoin are more robust. Objectively, they are more powerful since much more data and state can be tracked via the use of a secondary database and such data cannot be lost by using a non-XCP or non-Mastercoin aware wallet.': 2, 'If speed is a concern, a broker at WallStreet could still hold 20% of a stock and allow his clients to move these around between their accounts in lightning speed. Also I assume that micro payment channels would work the same for higher speed trading.': 1, "They are denominated in XCP so that the buyback only takes one Bitcoin transaction. This makes it feasible to do even when the call price is low and the Bitcoin fee is significant. \n\nIf you wanted to have this sort of linkage, I think it could be done with a contract based on the BTCXCP exchange rate. Nobody is currently offering a broadcast with that information but it is conceivable that someone will offer such broadcasts in the future and build reputation in exchange for a small fee. You could then place a bet, which others could take the other side of, to hedge against BTCXCP.\n\nThe other way to do this is going to be by setting the call price to double what the trading value is now. If the price of your asset doubles you could readjust this call price by issuing a new asset with a further doubled call price, and paying that as a dividend 1:1 for the initial asset. You would then stop honoring the original asset and pass the equity-torch to the new asset. This is just a though... I haven't seen that discussed just yet.": 1, 'Great to know- thanks!': 2, 'To issue an asset requires 0.5 XCP but after that you are limited by the built-in Counterparty limits of ~93 billion for divisible assets or 10^8 times that for non-divisible ones.

Yet policies have been proposed that could lower the total volume of currency transactions, and hence reduce the impact of speculation. One rather radical proposal is to eliminate foreign currency trading by establishing a single currency for several countries\n\nSome regulatory attempts:\nFrom: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speculation#Government_responses_and_regulation\n> The economic disadvantages of speculators has resulted in a number of attempts over the years to introduce regulations and restrictions to try and limit or reduce the impact of speculators. Such financial regulation is often enacted in response to a crisis as was the case with the Bubble Act 1720 which was passed by the British government at the height of the South Sea Bubble to try stop speculation in such schemes ...\n\nThere are a couple concepts to understand:\n\n* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_feedback#In_economics\n* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_fool_theory\n\nHere is a question: Could we self-regulate the exchange markets?\n\nLet\'s suppose each of the major exchanges voluntarily implements a system that prevents wide swings in market price - and there are fairly easy ways of doing that. A "throttling" mechanism for traders can slow down what could potentially be a big spike. Would there be enough agreement between the large exchanges to implement it? The smaller exchanges may not, but since the volume there is small anyways, they may not impact the volatility.\n\nSecond question: Could we design a mechanism directly into the Bitcoin protocol that could help prevent rapid speculative bubbles? Since speculation is a function of fiat currency (or quite frankly, anything acting as a base of value), perhaps not.\n\nFrom my perspective, speculation is equivalent of email spam. It\'s more of an attack on Bitcoin than a function of it. There are heuristic mechanisms to help prevent spam, various detection methods.\n\nHow could we prevent Bitcoin spam? We need to be able to differentiate between valid exchange and speculative exchange, just like separating real email from spam email.\n\nBut the ultimate gatekeeper here are the exchanges.\n\nThere have been discussions about distributed exchanges or decentralized exchanges. And perhaps in such a system, we could have a bit more control over tracking and throttling exchange - but it seems unlikely.\n\nIt\'s a tough problem, but I think worth solving if we do want Bitcoin to be stable and used as a currency, store of value, and unit of account.\n\nEdit: Another idea that came to my mind is as follows.\n\nPrice stabilization pools.\n\nImagine an exchange such as Bitstamp introducing a single price stabilization pool in which users can join. This is a special pool of funds dedicated to price stabilization. Users who are Bitcoin advocates and desire price stability can voluntarily enter this pool with some amount of money, which collectively, can provide a large amount of weight. \n\nNow, when there is a price move, the exchange automatically puts in the reverse order from the pool account that counters the move. This effectively returns the price to what it was before automatically.\n\nIn order to work properly against normal growth and corrections, the pool will operate on a formula that calculates volume, typical order sizes, as well as a normalized "pool vote" of how much movement is acceptable. Also, there would be a cutoff if a pattern is appearing that cannot be controlled by the pool. This is to protect the pool from a major shift in valuation (such as large players attempting to move the markets).\n\nIf this pool is large enough that collectively it easily encompasses the size of even the largest typical traders easily, perhaps it can act to help stabilize the volatility. Imagine a $200m stabilization pool of 200,000 users who each put in an average of $1,000. Now, a large $10m player can try to swing the market, but the stabilization pool would activate and act against it. It sort of "locks-in" the price. \n\nMaybe this is just crazy thinking, but I\'m just brainstorming on the fly.': 2, "- Volatility needs to decrease (the general population won't use it if they think one day it can get them a playstation, the next day it can get them a cup of coffee)\n\n- Acceptability; needs to be accepted in many more places\n\n- Accessibility; they need to be easy to get first, which till today there are still many barriers and headaches to getting bitcoin, and it comes at different prices with different challenges\n\nI see this taking another 3 years till it starts to stabilize and really go mainstream\n\n": 1, '0 days.

They assume that unless law springs from some act of agreement, some express or implicit social contract by which individuals consent to be bound, it is nothing more than force. According to this view, law is either a legitimate mechanism of social ordering that is consistent with respect for individual autonomy or an illegitimate mechanism of coercion by which some human beings are subjected to the will of others.\n\n>I believe this is a false dilemma. Law is rarely, if ever, grounded in consent. This does not mean, however, that law necessarily gives some\nindividuals command over others. There is a third possibility. Law can arise through a process of evolution. It can be a product of "human action, but not\nthe execution of any human design." In such a case, those subject to law are indeed bound, but not by the will of any particular human beings. Although\nlaw is inherently coercive, it is not inherently a vehicle for domination. To the extent that the ideal of the rule of law consists of a vision of a society governed by "laws but not men," this conception of law places the ideal within reach.\n\n>In this Article, I argue for this third possibility; for a society governed by law that evolves from human interaction without the conscious guidance\nof any particular human intelligence.': 2, '"\xe2\x80\x98We needed a new technology to have the wedge to be able to enter the market, to be able to justify all the work to rebuild the system.

Feels kind of meaningless. First, dollar & yuan isn't everything, there are significant euro-markets, e.g. Kraken traded a few million dollars the past 24 hours worth of bitcoin. There's also reason to assume Chinese markets are partially empty bot trades to inflate the numbers. And currency denominations imply some national interest, but that's misleading, loads of USD trading on Bitstamp is done by people from Europe, Latin-America etc. The data is interesting but let's put it in a context, right now it just looks like China is where 75% of bitcoin adoption is happening and the US the other 25%, and that simply is misleading.\n\n* p13. I disagree, Merchant processing is quite significant. They mention Overstock at $15k daily sales. But Bitpay, 8 months ago or so, revealed *over* $1m processed daily. I expect today, together with Coinbase, they do well over $3m daily. That's about as much as all of mining inflation from just two processors. There are a host of smaller processors (and much bigger established ones, like Mollie and soon Paypal) besides these two. \n\n* p14. raises an interesting point. It's quite plausible to assume miners were holding coin in Q1 and Q2 hoping for a price rise and making huge USD investments into equipment. But given hashrates continues to grow insanely fast, new investments are ready, which requires miners to sell off bitcoin holdings. The price drops, requiring more miners to sell larger quantities to fund their mining, causing a snowball effect.\n\n* p 16. is interesting, obviously partly connected to the bitcoin ecosystem, but it's painfully clear: 2x more altcoins but the total altcoin marketcap is down by 65%.\n\n* p 17. saddens me. It's painfully clear 9 of the top 10 most popular stories are purely about price. The least popular, number 10, and the only non-price story, is Paypal integrating bitcoin. I had hoped we'd have moved past bitcoin as just an investment in 2014. Of course price is a proxy of bitcoin's impact, but I can't shake the feeling there are a lot of people who couldn't care less about bitcoin dying in a fire in 2020 if they could cash out their 100x investment before then.\n\n* p 22. is an absolutely awesome idea, but it feels like crap data. I wonder how the index is calculated and how deep the dissemination of their questionnaire is. The chart doesn't at all seem to correlate with any real life events, it just seems to randomly go up and down.\n\n* p 44. small nitpick, while it's true Expedia has $5b in revenue, it processes over $40b a year in sales for its clients, which could potentially shift to bitcoin sales partially. Expedia doesn't actually sell anything, it's a bit like the eBay for travel. It makes sense to report on the sales that could be done in bitcoin, rather than the revenue of the underlying service provider which is less relevant.\n\n* p 47. 8m wallets at year's end, quite impressive. Hope we can get some more granular 'active wallet' data next year.\n\n* p 48. is interesting. Obviously Silk Road wasn't going to be the last. I've personally got no interest in these things, but it's hugely compelling to see the power of a decentralized currency in a market where fiat currency does not work: an online black market. And one can be sympathetic to the cause as many black markets are demonized for victimless crimes by a morality police. I'm no libertarian but I can see the flaws in that, and bitcoin circumvents it. Powerful stuff. Also interesting to see no other coin really succeeding here, I think largely due to the fact no other cryptocurrency has an ecosystem of onramps and offramps to make it possible.\n\n* p 50. Ouch, 1 ATM for a continent of over 1 billion people. I'm still hoping for some breakthrough either in SMS wallet adoption or partnerships with carriers to allow feature phone wallets.

Our hot wallet was compromised and our attackers managed to steal a little over 15 BTC of funds that were held in escrow. The nature of the attack was such that it was not immediately clear that anything had happened, which is why it has taken us until today to take action.\n\nFortunately the majority of users funds being held in escrow were safe in offline storage, so the impact of this attack was lessened. Please be assured that any users that have payments or refunds due will be contacted over the next few days and your money will be paid. The owners of CryptoThrift are absorbing the cost of this.\n\nWhilst we have not yet completed our investigation, we have identified the attack vector as a vulnerability in a third party plugin. This was used to inject SQL queries into our database and manipulate the amounts on transactions being released from escrow. What we have not made public until now is that we have seen sustained and almost-daily attack attempts on the site for many months. We have been in contact with the Australian Federal Police regarding this, and will be sharing with them all data that we have on this attack as well as all previous attempts.\n\nThis attack has prompted us to reflect on our security measures, and we have concluded that we need to make some significant changes to our escrow process, our storage of customers funds, and have a third-party conduct a full security audit. Until this is complete, we feel we have no choice but temporarily suspend our escrow service for our users, as we simply cannot risk holding users funds. Effective immediately, buyers will no longer be able to choose to use escrow when purchasing items. All existing transactions that are in escrow will be honored until they are released or refunded.\n\nCryptoThrift is owned and operated by two guys, both with families and full-time jobs, who run this site in their evenings and weekends to try and create something new for the crypto community. We have made every effort to provide good customer service and have put 100% of all profits back into development, advertising, and marketing. A such, the cost of this theft is being covered by us personally. If our attackers wish to do the right thing and return our funds to us, they can do so by sending it back to 19bBwiFrAaCLxZZoS4grTDoFFVszxzvPMo. If any of our users wish to help, we would gratefully receive donations of support to the same address.\n\nWe must sincerely apologize to our loyal users for this breach and our decision to temporarily remove our escrow service. It is heartbreaking for us to see our hard work destroyed by cold-hearted, thoughtless, hackers.\n\nThanks for all your support, and we hope that you continue to use our site.

And I mean not just speculatively trading bitcoin and fiat, I mean trades that make the physical world better in some way, ordering goods and services.\n\nSo in that sense it does not seem to matter what the price of bitcoin is. If you need to buy something you get the appropriate amount of btc for the transaction and send it through, on the other end it is converted back to fiat. The end result is like you just converted your fiat from one country into the fiat of another and you can ignore the price of bitcoin as it is irrelevant. \n\nThe important question to ask here is did both parties get a fair trade? I think at the moment there are noticable imbalances between certain international markets and these are increasingly having an effect as a kind of feedback loop causing more trades to occur and benefitting the party that is more efficient with resources, bitcoin trades occur if they offer goods or services that is not locally available for fiat or it is preferable to the customer in some other way.\n\nTo return to the price of bitcoin again and to reiterate. If I want to buy something over the net and the seller accepts bitcoin, I don't really care what the bitcoin amount is really, I'm looking at the exchange rate between my local fiat currency and the seller's asking fiat currency times the amount, this tells me if its a fair trade from my point of view or not. Bitcoin is simply the medium which enabled this teleporting and transmutaton of fiat. \nIn this light, the buyer and seller only owns bitcoin for a few moments before someone else gets to use it again for their transaction. So in this sense, the price of bitcoin is dependant on per fiat exchange transaction volume times confirmation time. Ofcourse people can choose to hold onto the bitcoin, but thats not very useful. There is plenty of bitcoin left for others to use instead. It looks to me like owning bitcoin is like owning a slice of international currency exchange bandwidth,  similar to owning part of an undersea fiber connection.\n\nWhile fiat remains the holding currency for the majority, the price of bitcoin will only rise when we hit a supply limitation, that means the available cheap bitcoin has become too little to transfer the information of  the fiat transaction. We are a long way from that, and I doubt we'll run into that problem before we see the result of bitcoin on the fiat exchange rates.\n\nSo, bitcoin is primarily used between the US, EU, CHINA.. it is picking up in developing countries. The most influential aspect is connecting the world markets without friction. So any differences in regulations or policies that affected the fiat markets do not affect the bitcoin markets (negatively only, if its more profitable to trade bitcoin than fiat people will). So bitcoin will put pressure on local markets to become competitive on the international level playing field as the effects of policy and regulation at borders become less effective.\n\nThis might cause some fiat currencies to be dropped in favor of bitcoin in countries where there forms a destructive feedbackloop where bitcoin effectively feeds off the inefficiency of the local fiat market that is burdened by corruption and over taxation.\n\nSorry for the long post.
