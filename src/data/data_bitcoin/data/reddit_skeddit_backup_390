So, what incentives does a miner have to run a full node rather than outsource that job to another party? Well, the network is more secure making both the Bitcoins he has and the Bitcoins he is to gain slightly more valuable, and he has full node security. \n\nThe cost of a full node is relatively little, probably somewhere between $5 and $15 for our current 500KB block average. With that cost we currently have a mining ecosystem in which a handful of miners have a majority. These miners have decided individually that they should run a full node rather than outsource that cost to a third party, mostly because benefitting the network benefits them. Now if running a full node were cheaper we could expect more miners to run full nodes rather than outsourcing block creation to a third party.\n\nEvery miner has a cost at which they will start or stop running a full node. Larger miners have a larger stake in the network and will run them at higher costs. Remember, the question is not whether they can run a full node, I'm sure the vast majority of miners *can* run a full node, but why should they when it costs more to run a full node than it increases Bitcoins utility and their moneys value.\n\nAs full node costs increase, it is fair to assume miners with smaller hashrate and smaller unrealized gains will have the same or nearly the same benefits from running a full node, but greater costs. In the end this means that less miners will run full nodes and more miners will delegate their hashing power to a large miner who will generate the blocks for them.\n\n In the end yes, you can have larger blocks, and you can have everyone running SPV clients, but if the mining ecosystem is worse than it is today, or even stays as bad as it is today for an extended period, Bitcoin isn't sufficiently trustless and has little or no advantage over some centralized and trust requiring by design alternative.": 2}, ('Bitcoin May Have Its Time In The Sun As Greek Banks Go Kaput', 3): {}, ('Leap Second Problems?', 2): {'The bitcoin system itself doesn\'t care about precise time synchronization on those timescales.\n\n(And a good thing it doesn\'t or leapseconds would very much break it).\n\nThere were no issues with Bitcoin observed during the last leapsecond.\n\nSome of the "POS" altcoins will likely have issues, but no one will notice.': 2, "I would imagine not bitcoin, since blockchain time is not super-accurate.

A simple answer is that there is no central authority to decide access, that is the protocol does not require a license etc. from miners or nodes etc. Whether people will want to participate or not, however, is a different question.\n\nIf everyone has the opportunity to run a node, and people value such opportunity, then enough people will run a node for the system to be decentralised. I suppose that's economics 101.\n\nDecentralisation does not however mean that running the infrastructure needs be free. Such system would depend on the good will of the participants, thus leading the participants to have to trust each other, as well as suffer from the tragedy of the commons. \n\nDecentralisation does not mean that running the infrastructure needs be at such a low cost that every single person on earth can do so as that would lead to optimising for the lowest common denominator regardless of whether or otherwise those individuals are even using the opportunity to take part in running the infrastructure, which they probably aren't. \n\nNecessarily, running a node can not be free regardless of the blocksize or at such a low cost that you can effectively run it on an iPhone. That is why there is the whole capitalistic aspect of the block reward which incentivises participants to invest in the infrastructure for their own benefit and in the processes provide security to all. So requiring a good internet connection is simply asking those who benefit to invest some 6 dollars a month or 60 on some good internet connection. A tiny investment affordable by even someone on a very low income. \n\nHow that would in any way affect anyone who is currently running a node, most of whom probably do so because  they are mining, or running a business, or researching, or value a very high level of privacy, I can not see. \n\nDo the current node runners really not value the absolute security that running a node provides more than 6 or 60 dollars a month?

It implies to analyze the worst outcomes (probabilities of occurrences, conditions of occurrence, cost estimation, mitigation plans, ...)\nThe point isn\'t to know if big blocks will appear after the modification of the limit. The point is to enumerate/describe what might happen in the worst cases.\nIf this kind of work can\'t be done without raising a wave of ad hominem attacks, let\'s just stop all discussions. It will save a lot of time and energy for everyone.\n\n\nTo get back to the OP:\n\n- Does anybody know a study/experiment showing that current implementation of the P2P network (without optimizations like the relay network) can cope with 2M, 4M, 8M, ... blocks without any risk for the protocol (consensus about the longest chain)\n- Can we all agree on the fact that the relay network isn\'t a P2P network but that it relies on a small set of relay nodes and that part of its security relies on the fact that some of these nodes are not public (WRT ddos attacks) ?\n- Can we all agree that the security model of the relay network is different from the security model of the P2P network ?\n- Can we all agree that for now, it doesn\'t matter because there is a redundancy of the 2 networks ? (the P2P network can cope with 1mb blocks)\n- Can we all agree that if current implementation of the P2P network can\'t cope with big blocks, that should be mentioned explicitly in the proposals, considering that bitcoin is a "Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System" ?\n\n\nWRT to the incentive of mining pools to produce small blocks: Yes. Sure. This is one of the core principles of bitcoin.\n\n- Anyway, what are the risks if a mining pool with significant hashing power and access to the private relay nodes is coerced and goes rogue ? \n- What are the consequences for the global network ? \n- Do we have the same consequences with the current limit and with a 8Mb limit ?\n- Can we afford the risks associated to bigger blocks, considering the potential benefits.\n\n\nWhatever the conclusions, this is the kind of analysis I would expect to see in these discussions.\n\n\n\nTL/DR: \nAvoiding any talk about the risks associated to a proposal is a marketing approach.
