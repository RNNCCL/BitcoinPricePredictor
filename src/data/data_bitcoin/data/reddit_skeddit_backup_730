No lawyers. No trust. All I have to do is spend from my addresses once every 6 months to avoid the trigger.\n\nUnfortunately, this isn't currently possible with bitcoin scripting features. I'm pretty much waiting for it to become possible through bitcoin (or XCP or Ethereum, etc.) and easy to set up. Any other method either requires someone to find something or trusting someone to give something to someone else. I want it to be automatic. No multisig. No lawyers.  \n\nI want a dead man's switch: I die. 6 months passes.

Any old story?  \n  \nYears ago, a close friend and I were travelling over a long icy city bridge. The weather sucked and we foolishly traveled on bald tires (we were flat broke) and squinted through a frosty windshield. I was the passenger, as usual, and my good buddy was doing his best to navigate and control the big, ugly, 1972 Ford Custom 500.  \nAs we grew closer to the top of the bridge, the car suddenly vectored sideways. Despite my buddy doing his best to regain control, we spun around multiple times on the ice in what seemed like slow motion. Within seconds we rammed the car backwards into the center guard rail. The impact dazed us both. I snapped out of it and looked forward out the windshield. Coming straight for us was a city bus.  \nI recall yelling something like, "Get us the hell out of here." All I could hear was my pal cranking over the old starter. The engine had died.  \nI haven\'t begged a car to start as much as I did that day. I looked up and saw the bus coming closer. All of this was in just a matter of seconds. I could now see the bus drivers face. He looked terrified. \n  \nWith the car backwards, the starter cranking, my buddy swearing at it, and the bus driver doing his best to keep the now slowly skidding bus straight, I realized that I was laughing my ass off. Everything was fucked, and my life was coming to an abrupt end in the odd slow motion disaster that was likely the end of my last day. I can still remember the look on the bus drivers face as he he saw me staring at him, laughing. I thought it was a strange way to leave the world.  \nThe sound of a strained starter ended, shitty tires spun on slick ice, and my friend punched the car forwards, against the oncoming traffic. The car once again lost grip and we spun again, this time 180 degrees facing the proper direction while we slid backwards, the engine dying again, alongside the still braking and sliding bus. We skidded to a halt and watched the bus straighten out and continue on.  \nMy buddy looked over at me and asked me what the hell I was laughing at. I wasn\'t sure. I recall myself saying something along the lines of, "I didn\'t want to go out unhappy."  \nHe laughed.': 2, '[deleted]': 1, 'Thanks!\n\nWhat kind of material are the cards printed on?

There was also this thief/peasant named Aladdin. The princess had to marry a prince. Aladdin wanted a chance with her. Also there was an evil sorcerer named Jaffar(sp?). He had a parrot. \n\nSomehow Jaffar sent Aladdin into this magic cave full of treasure and Aladdin found a lamp with a genie in it. The genie was willing to grant Aladdin three wishes. Aladdin used one of this wishes to become a price so he could court the princess and went off to meet her. \n\nSo here is where it gets fuzzy...\n\nJaffar wanted something... maybe the genie for himself and/or possibly to marry the princess? Then some stuff happened. There was a magic carpet. I think that there was a magic fight with the genie/jaffar. I think jaffar ended up being swallowed by the sand. \n\nAnyway...

In fact, it's still very common to do so when the semicolon is used as a way to separate list items that are so complex that commas alone are insufficient to delineate boundaries; this is particularly true in legalese, which cannot afford the space required for bullet points. For instance, consider this use of bullet points to separate very complex items of a list:\n\n* When the old man died, he bequeathed his belongings to a number of people:\n\n    * The nice girl who brought him fruit, vegetables, meat, bread, and beer every week.\n\n    * His brother in Conneticut, but not his brother in New York.\n\n    * The nearby church, even though he was an atheist.\n\n    * Finally, the animal shelter, so that there would be funds enough to take care of his 2 dogs, Pluto and Annabel.\n\nThese could be compressed into a paragraph by using semicolons:\n\n* When the old man died, he bequeathed his belongings to a number of people: the nice girl who brought him fruit, vegetables, meat, bread, and beer every week; his brother in Conneticut, but not his brother in New York; the nearby church, even though he was an atheist; **and**, finally, to the animal shelter, so that there would be funds enough to take care of his 2 dogs, Pluto and Annabel.\n\nJust try doing that *without* the semicolon! A period doesn't make sense, because each item of the list isn't a complete sentence. More to the point, a comma isn't suitable, because it might compete with a comma embedded in the item itself.\n\nAs for the main use of the semicolon outlined previously, it makes sense to follow a semicolon with a conjunction only if it makes sense to follow a period with a conjunction**.

H**is guitar playing was the most spectacular thing I've ever seen!\n\nHowever, that destroys the notion that these sentences are meant to be highly related, which is especially valuable to convey when they are surrounded by a lot of other sentences; thus, the comma is kind of combined with the period to form a semicolon (which is, as the name implies, *almost* a colon):\n\n* I had a really good time**; h**is guitar playing was the most spectacular thing I've ever seen!": -1, 'The idea that you are trying to express necessitates a form of the verb known as the [subjunctive mood](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjunctive_mood):\n\n> Subjunctive forms of verbs are typically used to express various states of unreality such as wish, emotion, possibility, judgment, opinion, necessity, or action that has not yet occurred\n\n[Specificially](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_subjunctive#Use_of_the_past_subjunctive):\n\n> As already mentioned, the only distinct past subjunctive form in English (i.e. form that differs from the corresponding past indicative) is ***were***, which differs when used with a first- or third-person singular subject (where the indicative form is ***was***)&hellip;\n\nThat is, most subjective mood forms look exactly like the past tense forms ("I wish he **took** my advice") even though they have nothing to do with the past tense, which is why you and a lot of other people think that "was" is correct in this case ("I wish he **was** willing to take my advice"); however, the correct form is "were" in this case ("I wish he **were** willing to take my advice").

We run multiple channels on Amazon, eBay, Newegg, Buy.com...\nWe participated the BCBF site, so I hope I can help answering these questions. There are a few reasons why e-commerce don\'t want to ship outside of US.\n\n1. Time -\nMost of the e-commerce runs multiple channels. Order processing is automatic with software like sellercloud or linnworks. Processing orders for international is time-consuming. It requires custom form and manual processing. Most of the companies simply don\'t bother.\n\n2. Shipping Cost -\nShipping cost is simply too high with international. If an item is cheap enough, light enough, you can ship it First Class Mail International, which is around $10. If an item is more than 1lb, you will need to ship Priority Mail International, which is around $40. Unless you are buying something light, unique that you can\'t find in Europe, there is really no incentive to buy from US.\n\n3. Fraud -\nOpening your store to the world means that you are very likely to get a lot of fraud orders. So far, we can still manage to deal with credit card fraud. Most of the international "fraud" orders are shipping to forwarding companies. For example, we got an $1200 order shipping to a US forwarding company. IP is in US (VPN/Proxy), referring website is Google Egypt, paid with a US Credit card with wrong cvv and billing doesn\'t match. It would be much harder for us to deal with fraud if we ship outside of US. Of course, Bitcoin would be ideal since there is pretty much zero consumer protection. However, credit card and paypal are what general public use and small business like us can\'t afford to lose business and go 100% Bitcoin. To be honest, we haven\'t received any Bitcoin orders. Even with the hype of Bitcoin BlackFriday, we received less than 20 referrals from the website, and no order. It has more to do with our product line though. Our website is a new project, so we haven\'t put up everything on the site yet.  \n\n4. Return -\nMost of the US stores provide 14-30 days return policy. It\'s a hard to deal with return from international customers. eBay has Global Shipping Program which makes shipping to international customers much easier. However, it costs customers a lot of money to send back the item if there is any issues. We mostly sell refurbished products. Samsung, Microsoft, Sony...they are as good as new and rarely have issues, but it\'s very normal to have a return rate of up to 10% with some other companies products.We don\'t want to wrong the customer, but we also don\'t want to lose round trip shipping cost to get a customer return. \n\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.

This hides that you're using Tor from someone between you and your VPN and hides what you're doing from your VPN. The trade off is that you're still vulnerable to deanonymizing attacks on Tor and your Tor exit node can see everything that gets sent out to the open internet in the clear. However depending on how you're using the internet the deanonymizing attacks could just reveal the VPN you're using without compromising your identity. For example read only web browsing probably wouldn't reveal too much about yourself even if the exit node found your VPN, but logging into facebook over an http (not https) connection would.\n\n>VPN wrapped in Tor \n\nIn this case your ISP or work can see that you're using Tor, but like the last example can't see what you're doing.

You could still be vulnerable to deanonymizing attacks because you're connected to Tor directly, but I don't know of any that work against encrypted traffic except for controlling most of the Tor network.

Cash, credit cards and current banking systems widely surpass Bitcoin in terms of their use to finance crime. Bitcoin can bring significant innovation in payment systems and the benefits of such innovation are often considered to be far beyond their potential drawbacks.\n> \n> Bitcoin is designed to be a huge step forward in making money more secure and could also act as a significant protection against many forms of financial crime. For instance, bitcoins are completely impossible to counterfeit. Users are in full control of their payments and cannot receive unapproved charges such as with credit card fraud. Bitcoin transactions are irreversible and immune to fraudulent chargebacks. Bitcoin allows money to be secured against theft and loss using very strong and useful mechanisms such as backups, encryption, and multiple signatures.\n> \n> Some concerns have been raised that Bitcoin could be more attractive to criminals because it can be used to make private and irreversible payments. However, these features already exist with cash and wire transfer, which are widely used and well-established. The use of Bitcoin will undoubtedly be subjected to similar regulations that are already in place inside existing financial systems, and Bitcoin is not likely to prevent criminal investigations from being conducted. In general, it is common for important breakthroughs to be perceived as being controversial before their benefits are well understood.

But also because we think that **nobody should have to pay to be safe while using computers**. Unfortunately, Tails cannot stay alive without money as developing Tails and maintaining our infrastructure [has a cost](https://tails.boum.org/news/../doc/about/finances/index.en.html).\n\nWe rely solely on donations from individuals and supporting organizations to keep Tails updated and getting always better. **That\'s why we need your help!**\n\nIf you find Tails useful, please consider [donating money](https://tails.boum.org/news/../contribute/how/donate/index.en.html) or [contributing some of your time and skills](https://tails.boum.org/news/../contribute/index.en.html) to the project. Donations to Tails are tax-deducible both in the US and in Europe.\n\nIn October 2014, Tails was being used by more than 11 500 people [daily](https://tails.boum.org/news/../support/faq/index.en.html#boot_statistics). The profile of Tor and Tails users is very diverse. This diversity increases the anonymity provided by those tools for everyone by making it harder to target and to identify a specific type of user. From the various contacts that we have with organizations working on the ground, we know that Tails has been used by:\n\n**Journalists wanting to protect themselves or their sources.**\n\n* [Reporters Without Borders](https://rsf.org/) is an organization that promotes and defends freedom of information, freedom of the press, and has consultant status at the United Nations. RWB [advertises the use of Tails](https://www.wefightcensorship.org/article/tails-amnesic-incognito-live-systemhtml.html) for journalists to fight censorship and protect their sources. RWB uses Tails in their training sessions world-wide.\n\n* [According to Laura Poitras, Glen Greenwald, and Barton Gellman](https://pressfreedomfoundation.org/blog/2014/04/help-support-little-known-privacy-tool-has-been-critical-journalists-reporting-nsa), Tails has been an essential tool to work on the Snowden documents and report on the NSA spying. In a recent [article for The Intercept](https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2014/10/28/smuggling-snowden-secrets/), Micah Lee gives many details on how Tails helped them starting to work together.\n\n* [Fahad Desmukh](http://desmukh.com/), a freelance journalist based in Pakistan who is also working for [Bytes for All](http://content.bytesforall.pk/) always has a Tails USB handy: "I can use it whenever I may need to and I especially make sure to keep it with me when travelling. Pakistan really isn\'t the safest place for journalists so thanks to the Tails team for an amazing tool."\n\n* [Jean-Marc Manach](http://jean-marc.manach.net/), a journalist based in France and specialized in online privacy said that "war reporters have to buy helmets, bullet-proof vests and rent armored cars; journalists using the Internet for their investigations are much luckier: to be as secured as war reporters, they only have to download Tails, burn it on a CD, install it on a SD card, and learn the basics of information and communication security, and it\'s free!"\n\n**Human-right defenders organizing in repressive contexts.**\n\n* Tails has been used in combination with [Martus](https://www.martus.org/), an information system used to report on human rights abuses, to allow [Tibetan communities in exile](http://benetech.org/2014/01/07/a-rat-in-the-registry-the-case-for-martus-on-tails/) to protect themselves from targeted malware attacks.\n  \n**Democracy defenders facing dictatorships.**\n\n* The [National Democratic Institute](https://www.ndi.org/), a Washington-based democracy support organization that works in more than 70 countries around the world, has used Tails to [help human rights defenders to communicate securely](http://www.coe.int/en/web/world-forum-democracy/lab4_). For instance, NDI used Tails to created a [data collection system in Belarus](http://cryptome.org/2014/07/tails-belarus-elections.pdf) to help opposition forces to collect, store and manage voter information.\n\n**Citizens facing national emergencies.**\n\nDuring the last years, we noticed that the use of Tor and Tails systematically peaks when countries face national emergencies. Even if Tails represents a small amount of the global Tor usage, it is advertised by the Tor Project as the safest platform to protect from strong adversaries.\n\n* In [Starting a revolution with technology](http://edition.cnn.com/2011/TECH/innovation/06/17/mesh.technology.revolution/), Slim Amamou, Tunisian blogger and former Secretary of State for Sport and Youth, explains that Tor "was vital to get information and share it" during the Tunisian revolution of 2011, because social media pages sharing information about the protests were "systematically censored so you could not access them without censorship circumvention tools".\n\n* Between January 25, the day the Egyptian Revolution of 2011 began, and January 27 2011, the number of [Tor users in Egypt](https://blog.torproject.org/blog/recent-events-egypt) was multiplied at least by 4. On January 27, the Egyptian goverment decided to halt Internet access accross the country.\n\n* Between March 19 and March 31, the number of [Tor users in Turkey](https://metrics.torproject.org/users.html?graph=userstats-relay-country&start=2014-03-01&end=2014-04-01&country=tr&events=off#userstats-relay-country) was multiplied by 3 as a direct response to the growing Internet censorship in the country: on 20 March 2014, access to Twitter was blocked in Turkey, and on 27 March 2014 access to YouTube was blocked.\n\n**Domestic violence survivors escaping from their abusers.**\n\n* The Tor Project has been working with organizations fighting against domestic violence such as [NNEDV](http://nnedv.org/), [Transition House](http://www.transitionhouse.org/), and [Emerge](http://www.emergedv.com/) to help survivors escape digital surveillance from their abuser and report on their situation.

(although hex is almost always in two-digit increments, so it would actually be "0b".  the reason hex is in two digits, is because it\'s actually base 256 aka 16*16).\n\nso just like you can convert base 10 to hex, or either one of those into a string of 1\'s and 0\'s (aka base 2), you can also convert them into higher bases, like base64, which uses numbers, lower case letters, uppercase letters, and a few symbols to all represent larger numbers with a single character.  base58 is roughly the same as base64 except it doesn\'t use any symbols, or lowercase L\'s and capital I\'s, or O\'s or 0\'s, specifically to prevent typos and misunderstandings when reading it.\n\nthe Private key WIF format uses base58.  all it\'s doing is converting the hex from base 16 into base58.  it always starts with a "5" because bitcoin prepends a "80" at the beginning of the hex to identify it as a bitcoin private key.\n\n(base58 encoding in bitcoin also usually hashes the hex and appends a small portion of the hash before converting, so that any typos will fail the re-check of the hash, and thus typos will be caught and you can\'t enter it wrong without throwing an error.)\n\nbitcoin public addresses are actually the hash of a public key, not the public key itself.  bitcoin public keys are actually just math coordinates, an X and Y value, on the math curve Y^2 = X^3 + 7.  because that\'s the curve, you can easily see that for any given X value, there are two possible Y values, a positive one and a negative one, both of which equal Y^2 when squared.  (bear with me, i\'ll explain why this is relevant soon!)\n\ntherefore, when you type out a public key, you can type the full key -- the X and the Y coordinate -- or just the X coordinate, and from that you can derive the Y value.  so uncompressed bitcoin keys are the full X+Y coordinates, and compressed keys are just the X value, but with a single byte prefix to indicate whether Y is positive or negative.\n\nthe compressed key and the uncompressed key will have different hashes, and since bitcoin addresses are hashes of public keys, that means that a public key can correspond to either of two addresses, depending on whether the public key is written in compressed form or uncomrpessed form.\n\nnow then, back to private keys.  the base58 WIF keys that start with 5 are always assumed to belong to uncompressed public keys.  therefore, you can easily map a "5" key to a single bitcoin address.  if you want to denote a compressed public key, and therefore a different address, you add a "01" in hex at the end of the hex format of the key before converting it, which makes the private key when represented in base58 form always start with a "K" or "L".\n\nmost bitcoin software will only ever read the base58 addresses, but it is possible to convert to/from base58 from other formats.  that website that is showing you all those different formats is just showing them to make things easier for you, so you don\'t have to go through the modicum of effort to convert it yourself.\n\nso you can write down *any* of those keys, and it\'s fairly trivial (once you understand what\'s going on and how to do it) to convert it between formats.': 1, 'haha wat': 1, 'you only need one version.  because you can convert between versions.  and if that version is base58, then it already includes a checksum as a failsafe.': 1, 'This should help make some sense of it: \n\nhttps://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Private_key\n\nI tend to keep multiple versions as a failsafe.': 3, "No it doesn't": 1, "Compressed private keys aren't actually compressed themselves (they're actually 1 char longer), they just indicate that the public key should use the compressed format which affects which address the key is associated with.\n\ne.g.\n\n    Raw private key:       0265b63bb2e9d0fefd61ad42f43e0022450f489df4cc55d3f5fd0de2ebb903d0\n\n    WIF uncompessed:       5HqLpNjzHmC2KTUpMozuBxd61A1FBeJ4pTZNRbzzL3jpFQJdN5a\n    Public key (65 bytes): 04b63df5fdabb445e47e38da7676840e4705fe89d40fa248043d42dcbf10fff2a726985c777b45583b908d68d22c9113cccf61f9d363c2b5afc60b78ce95f6a06a\n    Address:               18DP1qXvQF1rLRkRzDZJamjZ8avryxZxHX\n\n    WIF compressed:        KwJNU6xjrz3epTsn2rSZMNWH5gk5bycKrUDsZbUx355yYS5Hb78s\n    Public key (33 bytes): 02b63df5fdabb445e47e38da7676840e4705fe89d40fa248043d42dcbf10fff2a7\n    Address:               1JjUFnN9o2kv3HMNfucJYht6z5Acgs6b2B\n\nPubkeys can be compressed because the elliptic curve that Bitcoin uses is symmetrical.

Wealth disparity breeds poverty.

The problem is that libertarian policies don\'t work at all in the fiat system and likely make the problem worse with the assumption that upward mobility would increase if there was less welfare. \n\nIn the real world we have a complex hybrid system stemmed from incumbent wealth control which is the source of the "corporations are evil" mantra.
