When a database keeps the original pieces of data sent by users (transactions) together with this meta-data about blocks, one should be able to check when a specific piece of data was added, whether it was tampered with, etc. And you can use that for replication too: a replica will receive all the original transactions and block headers, and so it will be able to verify that it received an accurate copy and nothing was omitted.\n\nSo it is something you can use instead of binlogs. Yeah you are supposed to store it in perpetuity if you want to be able to verify everything. But, in principle, a new node might receive a snapshot of the state together with signatures of all other nodes instead, that's weaker, but good enough if you assume that the majority of nodes are honest.\n\nSo the idea of a blockchain is that you're doing replication on a semantic level, using originally submitted data pieces and explicit votes. So it's not in any way tied to low-level details of DB operation, in principle you can use different dbms on different nodes and it should still work fine.\n\nBut BigchainDB cheats here by using DB replication mechanisms instead of doing blockchain-style replication. The block meta-data is still there, so in principle you _could_ replicate it into a completely separate instance and do full verification.

My intuition says that the "immutability" claim is very weak and relies on some otherwise unrealistic assumptions.\n\nEDIT: I read through the whitepaper, it seems that the authors confuse the definitions of tamper-resistance and immutability.  The paper essentially argues that immutability is provided by hashing everything and including the hash of the previous block.  Thus, changing any previous entry invalidates all forward blocks.  This does satisfy the definition of tamper resistance, but is not immutable. Bitcoin\'s strong, but in no way absolute, immutability is maintained by the laws of physics (Proof of Work), replication across mutually distrusting parties, and economic incentives to achieve correctness. All three of these work in concert to provide immutability, and removing any one (and possibly other features that aren\'t coming to mind) ultimately destroys the immutability property.

It is enough to do a little thought experiment.\n\nSuppose some entity (let\'s say R3, using $200M they are trying to raise) will launch 10000 new Bitcoin nodes overnight. Will the network become stronger? \n\nWhat if they manage to run a million new nodes? Would that make Bitcoin super-strong?\n\nIt\'s obvious that "the total number of full nodes" doesn\'t mean a shit.\n\n> I view full nodes similarly to people seeding a file in a bit torrent. The more seeders there are, the more robust the torrent, and the more difficult it would be to stop. \n\nSo for Roger Ver Bitcoin is kinda similar to BitTorrent: something decentralized, p2p.\n\nBut security and distributed systems experts understand that there is an abyss of difference between BitTorrent and Bitcoin, and what makes BitTorrent robust won\'t really help Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin is much more complex and subtle. Besides nodes we also have miners. And the currency, you know.\n\n> If this strategy of rapid growth results in Bitcoin becoming centralized and controlled, we are no worse off than we would have been if government-controlled-coin had surpassed us early on. \n\nBut that government-controlled-coin exists only in your imagination, Roger!

So what you\'re saying is that you\'re OK with the risk of Bitcoin becoming "centralized and controlled" just because that government-controlled-coin spooks you.\n\nThis is kinda ironic: we are so scared of a government-controlled-coin that we are going create it itself.\n\nRoger probably thinks that this risk is minimal, but people who actually are experts say that it\'s real.\n': 1, 'Roger Ver is not insightful since the Gov coin already exists in forms such as PayPal.': 0, 'interesting read.': 2, 'I believe that if someone can only see the merit of their own argument then it shows a lack of sincerity on their part.\n\n': 10, "That's pretty much how governments work - create a problem, offer a solution, become the problem.

But in the event they do not anyone can decrypt it anyway using the time-lock decryption.  This is a form of encryption a bit like proof-of-work in that it intentionally takes a certain amount of work to decrypt, except it is chosen to be non-parallelisable so you have to do it on one core of one CPU.

Transactions being invalid are allowed to be excluded.  This mostly compacts the amount of information nodes have to fetch to validate encrypted transactions.\n\nEncrypted transactions are protected from double-spending by other encrypted transactions or normal transactions.\n\nA simpler variant could be that key disclosure is voluntary compaction by miners and not time-lock encrypted, nothing breaks and as the transactions are respent more and more people learn the keys so eventually someone will broadcast them for mining.

There\'s a committed-transaction concept. This is related to centralization risk and privacy aspects. It\'s an idea related to the risks of mining power being concentrated in large mining pools. The idea is that the risk that you\'re worried about with concentration of mining power is that the miners might start to enforce policy, or governments might demand they do so, and the policies might be stuff like "the recipient of the transaction or the origination of the transaction". I found a mechanism to send an encrypted transaction to the network. In the initial stage, you encrypt the transaction in a certain way, the miners in the network validate the transaction. They are only partly validating it, because they can\'t see who it\'s from or to or the value, but because of the way it\'s encrypted they could see that it\'s not double spent. That\'s all that the initial validation does. After some time, after like six blocks or something, the person who sends the transaction can reveal the key to the network or to the recipient of the transaction. It means that the miner cannot enforce any policy because they cannot see any information about the transaction until it\'s done. After it\'s done, a miner cannot undo the transaction without undoing its own work. And if the miner did undo work, they would be losing miner revenue, and the user could just go ahead and reveal more transactions, so it makes it uneconomic for miners to enforce policy basically.': 38, "Doesn't this mean that all transactions now have to wait at minimum 6 blocks to see if they are included?": 1, 'Adam Back is Satoshi Nakamoto.': -3, "Got me curious, hope you don't mind additional quetsions.\n\n1.
