Let me know if there is a better way, but the best thing that leaps to my mind would be using cryptographic keys to sign submitted blocks and rejecting submissions that fail that authentication check. And/or you can limit source IP of a submission and/or air-gap the entire network to dedicated communication lines.\n\nSo, case A: you have an authentication layer, and then you have a blockchain squirreled away behind that.\n\nNow, let's compare this strategy with the standard, centralized HA database model. The three companies run multiple HA database nodes, probably Oracle though if you prefer elbow grease to licencing you can do the same with Postgres. They form a consortium to run the master nodes and each enterprise keeps one or more replicated instances up to date with that. No party can submit a write request to the master nodes without it being signed and authenticated, just like in case A with the blockchain.\n\nSo, case B: you have an authentication layer on top of HA database.\n\nFunctionally, the case B HA database model offers instant writes and instant settlements and requires nobody to submit PoW. It supports a million database features that blockchains were not designed to offer, a million financial report templates that have been used in centralized databases for aeons that blockchains have not had the time to acquire, a million trained specialists flooding the earth just looking for work who would be happy to maintain and troubleshoot the thing.\n\nCase A requires you to *submit* PoW, but since no meaningful competition exists game theory dictates that all parties will nerf it and the difficulty will drop as close to zero as possible. Either they rely on the outer layer of authentication to make PoW (thus, really the entire blockchain) meaningless or else they at least *try* to waste resources on PoW but could never compete with the hashing power attackers may bring to bear if they ever *were* able to crack the authentication layer. Every BFL rig that goes offline due to losing the Bitcoin race is cheap as hell for attackers from around the planet to buy up and launch this kind of attack.\n\nSo blockchain brings no added security to the table beyond the authentication method you use to keep it closed, and it's eating soup with a fork so far as actual data management compared to decades old centralized solutions already used the world over.": 6, "You'll have to dupe the entire world forever that the only blockchain that can exist for all purposes ever is the one Bitcoin is in.

TL;DR "I still really hate bitcoin"\n\n-----\n21 Inc and the plan to kill the free internet\n\nIzabella Kaminska\t| May 19 15:10 | 5 comments\n\nPart of the BITCOINMANIA SERIES\n\nDetails of the hottest, most secretive bitcoin start-up in Silicon Valley have finally been revealed by chairman and soon-to-be CEO Balaji Srinivasan of 21 Inc in a post on Medium. They are, by and large, exactly what FT Alphaville reported them to be. Cold sharp summary: Bitcoin mining devices in toasters.\n\nCalling this a simple internet of things play, however, would be lazy. To really put the audacity of Srinivasan\xe2\x80\x99s vision into perspective one first has to go back in time to the days of the early internet.\n\nThe first thing to understand is that the structure of today\xe2\x80\x99s internet economy owes almost everything to a single bold assumption by the early web pioneers, namely that \xe2\x80\x9cinformation wants to be free!\xe2\x80\x9c.\n\nNowhere is this vision better set out than in the 1982 movie Tron, which tells the story of a bunch of anthropomorphised computer programmers going against the yoke of an oppressive Master Control Programme in \xe2\x80\x9cthe grid\xe2\x80\x9d, a celluloid metaphor for the monopolistic tech corporations of the day.\n\nWhat is less known about the film is that computer scientist and digital utopian Alan Kay \xe2\x80\x94 the founding father of object oriented computing \xe2\x80\x94 acted as its key technical consultant, rendering much of the narrative his personal call to digital nerds to rise up and be rid of the evil corporate overlords who constrain the dissemination of information, as much as a Disney-type fable.\n\nAnd, in the real world, that\xe2\x80\x99s pretty much how the web turned out. Information was set free; industries were Napsterised and the internet economy was transformed into a socialistic system in which data and information roamed free.\n\nExcept that, with time, it has become clear that things didn\xe2\x80\x99t work out as intended. Instead of empowering the masses, the proliferation of free data has led to a Wild West free-for-all, where those who have a good understanding of how free information can be commandeered and exploited do exactly that.\n\nReturning to the Tron analogy, destroying the Master Control Programme did not lead to the free society the web idealists envisioned. The old authoritarian powers were simply displaced by newly emergent authorities instead.\n\nBy the time the sequel to the Tron movie arrived in 2010, it\xe2\x80\x99s clear the movie producers felt a need to communicate this change of heart as gracefully as possible. And so it was that the movie\xe2\x80\x99s message turned from advocating free information to warning that systems which strive for too much perfection inevitably fail, and that \xe2\x80\x98imperfection\xe2\x80\x99 is desirable. In this recasting, the web\xe2\x80\x99s most creative and vulnerable members needed protection if the web were to retain meaning and relevance in the real world.\n\nAs Kevin Flynn, chief protagonist and voice of the web pioneers, expresses ignominiously in the film: \xe2\x80\x9cI screwed it up, chasing after perfection.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBack in the real world, decades worth of social conditioning about the merits of free information hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been so easily overturned. Free digital content is pretty much taken for granted, even if there\xe2\x80\x99s no such thing as \xe2\x80\x9cfree.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe tech sector has a problem publicly admitting this.\n\nIf the sequel to the web, as we know it, is a hierarchal and monetised system, the transition consequently needs to be achieved in the same way that capitalism defeated Soviet communism \xe2\x80\x94 namely, by providing a small flavour of what it feels like to be a profiteering capitalist to those who, under the old system, would not have been able to profiteer in the same way.\n\nWhich brings us back to the 21 Inc launch and a very obvious fact: Information is not free and Silicon Valley knows it\n\nOne of the reasons, we propose, the tech gods of Silicon Valley are so keen on forwarding Bitcoin as a concept is because it ultimately allows them to back-pedal on the original premise that information should be free.\n\nIn that regard, 21 Inc arguably plays a critical role in the new Silicon Valley vision for a \xe2\x80\x9cpaid for\xe2\x80\x9d meritocracy on the internet.\n\nWhen FT Alphaville first outlined 21 Inc\xe2\x80\x99s business model, showing that it planned to \xe2\x80\x98democratise\xe2\x80\x99 Bitcoin mining by embedding ASIC mining chips into everyday connected devices like USB rechargers, we noted the economics didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to make any sense. For one thing, it didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem conceivable that consumers could ever profit from the tiny fractions of bitcoins they were mining, especially after their energy costs were factored in. Secondly, it seemed much more likely the model would see consumers subsidising the energy costs of 21 Inc\xe2\x80\x99s own mining pool.\n\nBut the clue to 21\xe2\x80\xb2s real intention comes in the second part of Srinivasan\xe2\x80\x99s opening and explanatory paragraph:\n\nAfter much hard work, we\xe2\x80\x99ve created an embeddable mining chip which we call the BitShare that comes in a variety of form factors. The 21 BitShare can be embedded into an internet-connected device as a standalone chip or integrated into an existing chipset as a block of IP to generate a continuous stream of digital currency for use in a wide variety of applications. You can request a dev kit by signing up on our website to get started.\n\nWhat this really is, in other words, is a plan to bring a digital metering system to the internet.\n\nAnd on that note the two following paragraphs are critical to understanding the vision here:\n\nDevices that can pay your channel partners. At the manufacturer\xe2\x80\x99s discretion, the 21 BitShare chip can be configured to support a variety of different revenue shares for the mined bitcoin. For example, one could build an internet-connected device that shared some portion of mined bitcoin between the user, the retailer, the handset maker, and the carrier \xe2\x80\x94 thereby reducing costs and/or increasing margins throughout the entire supply chain. And because of the nature of mining as an embarrassingly parallel problem, embedded mining can scale up or down to fit within the power and thermal envelope of virtually any device.\n\nBitcoin-subsidized devices for the developing world. 21 was built by immigrants, and using our technology to get more people around the world online is important to us. We believe the most significant long-term application of bitcoin may be reducing the upfront cost of internet-connected devices to make them more accessible for the developing world. The success of the iPhone was in nontrivial part due to the carrier subsidy; with embedded bitcoin mining we can in theory extend that model to any internet-enabled device, turning a lump sum upfront cost into a potentially more manageable cost of power over time.\n\nSuddenly, a few of the 21 Inc pitch deck slides, which are circulating online and dare to compare 21 Inc to Google and Facebook, begin to make more sense:\n\nThis isn\xe2\x80\x99t about disrupting fiat money, central banks or the existing financial rentier system. It\xe2\x80\x99s about making the internet much more like the financialised real world. Namely, by adding an energy and scarcity cost to digital transfers on the web so that information can\xe2\x80\x99t be as easily exploited as it is today.\n\nUp for grabs, notably, is the marketshare of Google, Facebook and Twitter and their ilk, due to their dependency on free consumer data to drive their advertising-based revenue.\n\nAs it stands today, nobody really has an idea of what their data is worth because there\xe2\x80\x99s no mechanism by which processed or unprocessed data bundles can be valued.\n\nYet we know for a fact that personal data, especially when processed in aggregate form, does have a value in the open market. If it didn\xe2\x80\x99t, Facebook and Google wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be the multi-billion dollar organisations that they are today.\n\nBut the data market trades much more like highly illiquid OTC commodities than anything akin to an open market exchange. Deals seem to be done bilaterally, on a bespoke and opaque basis. There is no \xe2\x80\x9cprocessed data\xe2\x80\x9d-value index. And there is no inspection agent akin to a Platts or an Argus agent setting out the frequency and value of the trades that are taking place.\n\n': 1, '>Details of the hottest, most secretive bitcoin start-up in Silicon Valley have finally been revealed by chairman and soon-to-be CEO Balaji Srinivasan of 21 Inc in a post on Medium.

Customers pay once, and they pay before they know how useful the product is actually going to be to them. This means that they systematically overpay for crappy products and underpay for solid, useful products with long useful lifetimes. Many companies have tried to deal with this problem by switching over to a subscription-based model instead, but consumers often resist that idea because they don't like it when someone else owns and controls the things they use and rely on. 21's pitch is a way to allow subscription-type revenue streams while still offering consumers complete ownership of their device.\n\n>VCs understand this pitch. They see how huge this could be if it works. However, this pitch is not 21's business plan.\n\n>21's business plan is to engineer a convincing pitch, which they then present to VCs in order to get a ton of funding, which in turn they then use to design and fab their own ASIC using the world's best microprocessor fabs (Intel's), and then build multi-MW datacenters which they use to self-mine. The VCs and shareholders would not have ordinarily invested in mining, but when they see revenue coming in, they won't think too much about where it's coming from. \n\n>So far, it looks like they've been succeeding.\n\nhttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1065077.msg11428679#msg11428679": 1}, ('Just received Mycelium Entropy', 0): {}, ('Is it me or do I smell BS with 21\'s "mining" devices?', 0): {'[deleted]': 1, "Chip manufacturing tech plateaus after a while as does performance.

So they will be building the most efficient ASICs on the plant for their first batch of chips.  KnC and other small batch ASICs manufactures aren't going to be able to compete with that.  They roll out a meager 10,000 units.  All in hopes of being the first to market and to have the short lived competitive advantage to mine more coin, while their competitor finish their own 10,000 units, which brings everything back into balance.   Their advantage doesn't last long.

Once it plateaus, then all operations have to scale out massively instead of up.\n\nGiven this fact, think about how CPU cycles are distributed around the world on a per device basis.   20 years ago, it was all desktop and mainframes.   Today, are their more CPU cycles available in mainframes, desktops, or mobile phones?   The scale of many small devices wins.   The trend is clear.

Which is exactly what 21 Inc plans to do.   Millions of devices, versus, thousands of large scale ASICs.   \n\nI think ASICs will still be more efficient, but their market advantage will be eroded as profit margins are reduced.  One operation running at peek performance requires lots of capital, and has a defined ROI because VCs want to cash out.  \n\nMillions of users spending some electricity at night with marginal return isn't going to be that big of a deal.  The users aren't looking for high ROI, because the price of their device is probably subsidized by manufacturers trying to gain market share.    It shifts the incentives and costs around.   We all know that mining equalizes and margins go to zero in the long run.  21 inc effectively socializes the cost.\n\nThey are also building open technology and chips that can be added to many different devices.

The Bitcoin database services millions of users around the planet and has thus far shown itself to be essentially invulnerable to attack. Bitcoin does not require boundary defenses to protect the integrity of the database, instead it relies on a consensus of peers to build an independently verifiable historical record. To alter past revisions to the database, an attacker must wield computing power in excess of the combined power of honest participants in network. ChainDB seeks to apply that same approach to securing arbitrary sets of data in the cloud. However, rather than create yet another Bitcoin clone that requires its own mining network, ChainDB uses the existing Bitcoin mining network. In this paper, we outline the ChainDB consensus mechanism. \n\nedit:\n# Technical Questions & Request for Feedback\nWe've set up a [ChainDB Lab](https://labs.bitpay.com/c/chaindb) in our forums.
