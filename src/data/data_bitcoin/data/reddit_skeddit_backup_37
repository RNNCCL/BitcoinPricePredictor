Well, in a Turing-complete model, a secondary contract can be broadcast alongside the primary contract for the sole purpose of \'corrupting\' the oracle. This means that participants in the Turing-complete contract can not only engage in a contract, but can also bribe the oracle with impunity, and without repercussion.\n\nSo: Main contract which needs oracle -> Main contract + Parasite contract -> MAGIC -> Corrupted main contract. How exactly does one go about bribing or corrupting a contract with a dirt simple hash-reveal approach? If participants may only participate with votes they submitted answers for, signed by them, in a hash round. How exactly does one "bribe" the oracle? \n\nAssuming that he does have an answer for that it should be pointed out that Turing complete approaches can in fact also deal with multisig. Simple tweaks to multisig (max payout amounts, special reward, contest rounds, etc, etc, etc) alone make this a more attractive option. \n\nAnother thing he doesn\'t address is that state is as much a missing component from UTXO blockchains as scripting. Honestly if Bitcoin had state instead of spent / unpsent, there wouldn\'t be 90% of the problems we see in Bitcoin and the construction of sidechains today. \n\nAs for the main point of his article. That no-one needs the uses of Turing completeness because subsidizing the use of the network will be to high. This begs the question of if he\'s read the Ethereum white or yellow papers or if he has any idea what their road map looks like. I don\'t know if he was personally involved in implementing the EVM on Counterparty, but surely someone has told him about the gas price. It is more of a pay per use model than Bitcoin\'s is AND Ethereum\'s inflation (read miner subsidy) will be dropping to 0-2% in the near future. \n\nAssuming that the blockchain approach does have a hard limit to block-size in terms of how many TPS can be processed. That would simply mean that things that cannot afford to run on Ethereum will not run on Ethereum. That said I doubt this could ever extend to simple value transfers as their gas consumption is fairly low. \n\nLastly, no mention is made of the planned sharding of Ethereum. The approach introduces a whole large set of trade-offs that would allow FAR more to be done on the blockchain.\n\nThen again, I don\'t think the author is acting in good faith so I don\'t know if he\'ll be willing to concede any of ': 4, "Guys, we don't need cars, horses can take us from A to B just fine.": 3, 'I think every DNM has a turing-shaped-hole called exit scamming.': -1, "Rootstock forks 98% of Ethereum's code and is explicitly designed to leverage Ethereum's ecosystem.

That's what it's for right?\n\nIf my understanding is correct than what you are saying is basically that no situations exist where parties would prefer to submit to adjudication by a complex on-chain contract, that they will always prefer to use a third party (another human or an off-chain computation). I'd say that no-one knows yet if that is correct and it's a little early to make a prediction. Turing complete contracts are an experiment and we won't know the result of that experiment until such capability is available to the market for a long period of time. My suspicion is that it's going to be very good for some things, and unneccessary for many other things.\n\nThere is no exit scam from a Schelling game as the participants must spend money in order to participate and only profit if their answer is in the majority. This is also the reason why bribing such a game is not cheap, because the bribe is not only competing with the fees paid by the contract sponsoring the game but with the security deposits made by all of it's participants. If Bob knows Alice can always escalate the game to the point where Bob's bribe will definitely be unprofitable then there is no reason for Bob to try the bribe in the first place. It's mutually assured destruction so to speak.\n\nIs this better or cheaper than a centralized oracle? Well it's easier to coordinate a bribe with a single individual than to coordinate collusion with an unknown and open set of participants. Likewise the decentralized oracle has to expend considerably less effort in the area of human resources: consider for example the difficulties Ross Ulbricht had with the people he employed to help manage all of his customers.\n\nFinally consider that an 3th3r3um transaction is likely to cost significantly less than a bitcoin transaction of similar complexity since in most cases the contract itself is just an instance of an object whose class has already been uploaded to the blockchain. The contract then, in most cases just stores a small amount of state information which is destroyed once the whole interaction is complete. Every bitcoin transaction by comparison contains all of the code and data it needs forever.\n": 1, '> Guys, we don\'t need cars, horses can take us from A to B just fine.\n\nI\'m going to have to stop you right there. Ethereum originally billed itself as being the "[JavaScript to Web 2.0](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/ethereum-next-generation-cryptocurrency-decentralized-application-platform-1390528211)", and I quote:\n\n> Soon, however, we came up with Javascript, a programming language inside the web browser. And it was Javascript that solved the problem: because Javascript is a universal, Turing-complete programming language, it can be used to build apps of arbitrary complexity; Gmail, Facebook and even Bitcoin wallets have all been made with the language.\n\nSo let\'s use the more apt programming comparison, since this is after all how Ethereum advertised itself, it surely holds some weight. Ethereum is quite obviously JavaScript according to its founder.\n\nAnd thinking this through, since Bitcoin can *also* execute this "JavaScript" on sidechains, e.g. Rootstock, that would mean Bitcoin is actually *more* than just JavaScript.

I would suggest that the oracle problems here are no different, you would instead place a bounty that was shared by all voters. The problem you have with these crowdsourced oracles is that they make nothing from telling the truth, and exit-scamming their identity isn\'t likely to cost them much. If I were inclined to scam, I\'d spend a bit of time building trust over many identities, with the sole purpose of coordinating an exit scam on a big ticket bet.\n\nIt seems to me that the best way to normalize the exit scam risk is to do what we do today - have a single authority whose reputation is tied to accuracy over a large swath of the market (casinos, nitrogensports.eu, predictit.org, etc). And once you have this - multisig oracling is more efficient.\n\n> In this case in order to falsify the oracle Bob would need to bribe a majority of the schelling coin participants.\n\nI suspect this will be super cheap.

I don\'t know how augur plans to do this, but I suspect sybil attacks will be very cheap to do here.\n\n>  In that case Alice would have a reason to escalate the payouts of the oracle all the way up until the payout of the bribe is more than the amount Bob is owed or even higher because fuck Bob anyways.\n\nThat may be - but if bob is going to lose all his money anyways, he might as well raise his bribe to his entire wager "minus one". It depends on a lot of factors in the bet, but it\'s highly likely that this inefficiency will be significant, and compared to an centralized institution that normalizes risk, there will likely be no reason to use this crazy complicated path.\n\n> I would have an easier time doing it on a "Turing complete" (not actually) blockchain because the more expressive scripting language would allow the escrow contract to have many possible states.\n\nMaybe.

The main contention I have with this is that you consider a third party in a multisig address to be an oracle. I think the turing complete guys would contend that a real oracle would be a schelling coin game where participants are appropriately incentivized to give the correct answer to a particular proposition and other measures such as stakeholders having the ability to escalate the game if they feel the outcome is fraudulent.\n\nFor example lets say Alice wants to buy 1 tokens worth of Flakka from Bob. Alice sends 1 token to an escrow contract that holds the funds. (Bob and Alice of course reviewed the source code carefully before doing this.) The contract can either pay out to Bob when Alice receives the product or enter into a dispute resolution phase where Bob can submit evidence that he actually sent the package like images of Flakka, an oddly stained Fedex receipt etc. Participants can then review the evidence and decide if Bob should still be paid or if Alice should be refunded via a game.\n\nIn this case in order to falsify the oracle Bob would need to bribe a majority of the schelling coin participants. Since the oracle game would be public on the blockchain Bob could for example create a bounty contract that pays out to all the participants who say he sent the to Flakka even if he didn\'t. In that case Alice would have a reason to escalate the payouts of the oracle all the way up until the payout of the bribe is more than the amount Bob is owed or even higher because fuck Bob anyways.\n\nWe can debate the various attack vectors that Bob could use against such a game, but I don\'t think there is not much debate that if I did want to do this on a blockchain in order to avoid becoming the next Ross Ulbricht, I would have an easier time doing it on a "Turing complete" (not actually) blockchain because the more expressive scripting language would allow the escrow contract to have many possible states.': 2, "You don't understand Blockchains.

I agree with your point in principle, but the point of BitScrip is primarily to lowering the tech barrier to entry and make Bitcoin easier to understand.\n\nOnce you introduce mult-signature it goes from easy to understand (peel back the security seal and sweep the private key underneath) to significantly more complex (send me the public key for private key 1, which you generated, I'll generate private key 2 and do some crypto magic to make the multi-sig address. When you want to move Bitcoin to a new address track down private key 1 and find a multi-signature client to sweep the funds). In my opinion, if you want to watch a prospective user's eyes glaze over, you start them off on multi-signature.\n\nI appreciate the feedback, though. Please try the balance tool with one of your paper wallets if you get a chance, and I'll let you know if/when I implement a multi-signature line!\n": 0, "That's how it started.

I'm trying to bring the barrier to entry down a notch for the folks who don't know much about Bitcoin. \n\nBut again, you can use your own paper wallet and bitscrip.com to demonstrate the value of the Bitcoin at an address in any currency.

I do disagree that there are several inexpensive physical wallets available with easy to find tools available to show the value in any currency. There is software available to make your own paper wallets, but even using that adequately is beyond may people, and checking the balance in Bitcoin doesn't really resonate with people as how Bitcoin is a store of value. There are digital product that do this, but my personal experience is that I lose people in a hurry unless I try explain Bitcoin in a tangible fashion.\n\nI'll work on adding the 2 of 2 signature product. It won't be hard, but will take some time, since this isn't my day job. I'm just an enthusiast who is trying to help folks wrap their heads around how Bitcoin works and defer the costs associated with maintaining that development and infrastructure.

Blockchain.info has so much stuff going on it overwhelms people the first time they look at it. And again, you have to multiply Bitcoin balance by currency exchange rate for all of them.\n\nMy goal here wasn't to make a technical marvel (frankly, this isn't my career and I don't have the skillset for that). It's to make something very simple that helps someone wrap their head around Bitcoin as a store of value, point them toward information about how Bitcoin works, and prime some further conversations about Bitcoin. I've had very good success explaining Bitcoin this way. Not so much the other ways.\n\n": 1, "that's almost worse, because:\n\n1. if it's a paper wallet, they will literally need to get in touch with you so you manually sign the transaction (assuming its 2-of-2)\n\n2. if its 1-of-2 you can still take the funds at any time\n\n3. if it's 2-of-2 and you lose access to funds they lose the bitcoins forever\n\nI you really want to instruct people how Bitcoin works, make a tutorial on how to generate private keys and paper wallets.\n\nSorry but nothing about this makes any sense.\n\nI appreciate the effort (if, in fact, this is not an attempt to defraud newbies) but this is not something that any Bitcoiner should ever recommend to anyone.": 1, 'For a 2 of 2 signature, if a client emails me public key for private key 1 (their private key), I can generate private key 2 and use their public key to generate a multisignature address. I mail them the paper wallet with the multisignature address and private key 2. BitScrip doesn\'t come with any Bitcoin on it, so they wouldn\'t have any Bitcoin under my control at any point. They would control both private keys. Even if I was a bad actor, I would only have one.\n\nThe problem with that approach is it makes explaining Bitcoin rather difficult, and it\'s needlessly complicated. Just use a regular BitScrip and only use a small amount (.0001 BTC) for a demonstration.\n\nAlso, feel free to use a bitaddress.org paper wallet with my website (not that you need my permission). The BitScrip Balance Tool works very well, and I think you\'ll find people "get" Bitcoin pretty well when you use the Balance Tool and a paper wallet.\n\n': 1, "Agreed... bitcoin is about open agreed upon standards.\n\nI wouldn't trust my money in a new unaccepted standard, hosted on a website that could disappear next week.": 1, "You talk about balance tool as if it was some amazing invention when it's in fact a service that dozens of sites have allowed you to do for years ( blockchain.info, preev.com, coindesk.com/calculator, gobitcoin.io/en , to name a few..). Pretty much every bitcoin wallet today have the option to display fiat equivalent.\nPaper wallets are good for secure cold storage ( assuming they are not issued by a third party company). \nIf you want to explain bitcoin in a tangible fashion just tell them to download breadwallet and start exchanging coins with them back and forth. Nothing is more tangible than a mobile phone right, people already do all of their banking on the phone.

": 1, "I'm gonna be a bit harsh here but i guess criticism is productive. This product does not really educate user about bitcoin, it sends them the wrong message. For example each wallet cost a few dollars and so new users  will probably think that they can only have as many wallets as they can afford when in fact they can have thousands and for free. The other issue relates to address reuse, it is generally not recommanded to reuse address for privacy reason. Another wrong message sent is that you have to wait to receive the wallet ( exactly like you do when you first create a bank account) when in fact you could just print a wallet or download an app in 2 min. The last issue is trust, if customer thinks bitcoin is equal to trusting a company they have received the wrong message and they will  think that they can't create a wallet without a company.I personally wouldn't start a paper wallet business as i don't think the digital aspect of bitcoin is a barrier to adoption ( most thing are digital today, apple pay,tap &  pay,contactless payment ,etc..users like these new tech) but if i had to do a paper wallet business i would just create a very user friendly website where user can create and personnalize their own paper wallet by uploading some pics to have printed on the paper wallet , open source it and find revenue model, it is a lot more powerfull to be able to create as much wallet as you want, almost instantly and 100% securely.That's the education new users needs to have.

I absolutely agree that this isn't a product for folks who just stumble upon it on the Internet. \n\nThis is a product for people who already know about Bitcoin and want to show others how it works. These can be carried around with you easily. If you think someone might want to understand Bitcoin or be willing to take a payment in Bitcoin, you can explain it to them. You can explain that there are positive attributes and negative attributes to the different types of wallets (paper, determinstic, etc). You can send a small amount of Bitcoin to the BitScrip (.0001 BTC) and then walk them through the security of the transaction as more confirmations occur. You can show them how to sweep the funds back, or let them take it with them. You can help them download a secure client on their mobile device or encourage them to buy a Trezor if they're really excited. You can also explain that it's just as easy to send 10,000 BTC to a user in China as it was to send it to that BitScrip.\n\nWhen explaining Bitcoin, it's important to point out that BitScrip is essentially a premanufactured paper wallet. BitScrip is not Bitcoin. But BitScrip can help people who think Bitcoin isn't a real thing (a common refrain I have heard when I explain it, but maybe that's because I'm over 30) understand that you can send Bitcoin to an address on a wallet where the only way to move the Bitcoin to another wallet is to retrieve the private key underneath the one time seal. If you destroy the BitScrip, the Bitcoin still exists at that address. It's just irretrievable. Providing a tangible aid changes the very dynamics of the explanation. I'm 7/8 explaining with BitScrip, and 2 of those folks bought their own Bitcoin. I only tried to explain Bitcoin to a handful of people before I made this, and I can't think of a single positive result.\n\nI do appreciate the feedback, and I don't think this is a silver bullet.

I'm not sure what the best way would be, but this would definitely be a bad way to do it.\n\nI would ask you respect a bit of my privacy and not dox me for no reason. I have a day job I have no intention of leaving, but I'm very content to help people explain Bitcoin with a website and inexpensive paper wallets.

There are other sources of supply than the block reward. \n\nIf everybody just holds and doesn't actually spend of use Bitcoin then nobody sees the utility in them and the price ultimately drops.

Some miners/companies were able to get those ASIC miners first, they were mining LOTS of bitcoins and didn't need to sell them as electricity costs were minimal.\n\nHowever, the fact that people were buying mining equipment for bitcoins had the opposite effect.\n\nAll in all, we can only speculate about causes.\n\nBTW it's worth noting that price didn't shoot up immediately after halving, there was only a mild upturn.": 3, "The average electricity price in America is $0.12 based on this graph https://www.ovoenergy.com/guides/energy-guides/average-electricity-prices-kwh.html.\nLet's use best case scenario though and use China as the cheapest source of electricity so we say it costs around $0.08 per kWH.  \n\n\nUsing the cheapest rate possible of 1 kWH = $0.08 in a day it is simply 24 x $0.08 = $2.11 per kW day.\n\n\nBitcoin network hash rate = 1189496033 GHash per second = (1,189,496,033,000,000,000 Hashes)\n\n\n1GHash takes around 0.25w of energy to calculate for the most efficient chips around.  Therefore 1,189,496,033Ghash x 0.25Watts = 297374008 Watts = 297374 kWatts\n\n\nTherefore with the cheapest electricity and most efficient hardware the network costs **AT LEAST 297374 x $2.11 per day = $627,459 per day**\n\n\nThis means at least $627,459 is invested into the bitcoin network to pay for these bills.\n\n\nNote this doesn't cover overheads of amortization of hardware, rent on facilities, network costs, staff costs, host hardware, mining hardware is normally less efficient that 0.25W/GHash and taxes on earnings have been ignored so this daily cost is merely a lower bound and the actual cost is far higher!\n\n\nWhen halving happens if the demand remains constant and the supply is halved?

But if we assume that $1.5million new USD is invested into BTC per day (which I know is a poor assumption) and only $750k worth of new Bitcoins are created each day, then supposedly that extra $750k/day would go into increasing the price until it reaches a new equilibrium.\n\nObviously many have already tried to price this in.\n\nMy personal prediction is that we will see prices climb until the halving, and then a 10-25% drop in the weeks after, followed by a stabilizing period of several weeks, and within 6 months or so after the halving we will really start to see the effect of reduced new supply on the market.': 3, 'Just a minor comment on "When halving happens if the demand remains constant and the supply is halved?".\n\nThe supply is not halved.

Since these banks are not trying to create a currency, and are only using it as a ledger with perhaps a federated structure (only a certain number of signatories are given read/write access), they are not worried about double spends and therefore don\'t need a proof of work.\n\nUnderstand that even if someone gains root access to their network, it would be questionable whether they could even obtain write access without a properly setup banking blockchain. If I were a administrator, I would make it that only certain keys could have write access, and with public key crypto this is very easy to setup. Even if they set it up to allow a more global write access to its members, a hacker would still have to compromise the private signing keys to make any transactions to the Bankchain.\n\nThis is a *very large* advancement for the global banking community.

We will establish side chains and other layers that will eventually bridge the gap between all these alternative-chain\'s, allowing for interchain settlement.

However this feed of new money decreases gradually to 0 after 21 million have been created.\n\nSince only 21 million will ever be created in theory if someone losses the private key to a wallet of thosewise looses access to BTC then the total available decreases.  Mostly this is more than balanced out by the new income so anything like this has to be massive to have an effect of the exchange rate to Fiat (probably 100,000+).\n\nFor example it is understood that Satoshi has owned the keys for roughly 1 million BTC (maybe more, I'm quoting old analysis).  It's not known if he/she still have the private keys or not but if this was definately confirmed either way then I think this would have an effect.\n\nThe theoretical question is a bit invalid since you would have to wait untill all 21 million BTC have been issued, find a way to buy them all and then destroy it. I say invalid because it's near to impossible that you could buy ALL the bitcoin and if you did then bitcoin would ultimately have no value to anyone else.  You can try this today by creating you own bitcoin cloned alt coin, pre-mining all 21 million and establishing value by trying to sell them.  You probably won't get any buyers so the value is $0 and if you drestroy them you kill something nobody was using (or could use).\n\nAnyway I think that got a bit long winded so more simply lets say you manage to destroy 10.5 million BTC then the price would roughly double.

You cannot "destroy" BTC, you can only render it unspendable (like by sending it to an address that can never re-transmit it).

As all good money, it is regularly used for "illegal" purposes. However, at some point, the severely weakened World government regains significant power and strikes back, attacking NewCoin\'s weakest point: its central software repo and its dev team. If I managed to stay anonymous, I can time-lock most of my stash and distribute again the bitcoins to serve as truly censorship resistant money.\n\nThis implies no hard-forks, no soft-forks, no newer releases of a *reference implementation*.

Private blockchains are only useful in the context of multiple economic actors. That's beyond enterprise sales. It's *consortium* sales.\n2. If enterprise sales is getting a bill through Congress, consortium sales is passing an international treaty. [link](https://a16z.com/2014/05/30/selling-saas-products-dont-sell-themselves/)\n3. Private blockchains are more desirable when there is less trust (eg auditability is a goal). But less trust makes consortium sale harder.\n4. One inkling of this can be seen [here](http://www.coindesk.com/the-9-mistakes-i-made-when-bringing-blockchain-to-my-startup/).\n5. An additional factor: there are fewer consortia than enterprises. Hence the market is more [oligopsonistic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligopsony).\n6. So: oligopsonistic market (few large buyers w/ long sales cycles) means lots of leverage vs private blockchain vendors. CAC will be high.\n7. Moreover, LTV may not be that high, as consortia may demand totally open source solutions (e.g [PostChain-like](https://twitter.com/balajis/status/683429360020267009))\n8. That is, if history of internet micropayments is any guide, everyone wants to be the troll on the payment bridge - browsers, OS, banks.\n9. So even if a consortium *does* agree on a private blockchain, pure open source options may dominate...as they are demilitarized zones.\n10. That is, FB and Google compete on many things, but can cooperate on Linux as neither party can deprive the other of its contributions.\n11. For similar reasons, it may be easier to get consortia to agree on a pure open source private blockchain than a for-profit option.\n12. Even if they do agree on a commercial vendor, consortia members won't want to create a monster like studios did with Netflix/iTunes.\n13. They have leverage - private blockchain only exists with consortia's cooperation! - so will be hard to sustain profits at their expense.\n14. Thus, even though banks have a lot of money, for these logistical reasons it may be hard to build a large private blockchain company.\n15. So, to sell private blockchain: (i) assemble a consortium (ii) deal with consortia leverage as buyer (iii) survive long sales cycles.\nThat's hard!\n16.  Hard doesn't mean it's impossible.

I don\'t care if bitcoin\'s fees go slightly higher in the short term. Usage will obviously not be affected, because higher fees mean that more people are using bitcoin. This situation is highly preferable to a permanent ratcheting down of the number of full nodes. I say "ratcheting down" because it seems to me that as time goes on and the blockchain gets larger and larger in relation to personal computing technology, it will become more and more difficult to keep nodes from dropping off the network. The blockchain keeps growing bigger regardless of what devs do. But the tech won\'t scale any better unless the devs actively solve the issues with scaling now. Basically my position is that it\'s not pressing to solve the adoption problem right now, because that will be mitigated by fees. The scaling problem can only be solved with more core development. \n\n>a small increase in the block size is not going to centralize bitcoin as much as leaving it at 1mb and forcing everyone to go into the LN.\n\n>Right now there are around 6k nodes of various flavors.

You can still pay the fee and get on the real blockchain. Fees are tiny now. Even with a 100x increase in demand (which, by the way, won\'t happen if most transactions are occurring over the LN), fees will still be just $2, which will be fine for transactions above $20, depending on what your alternatives are. And if you absolutely just *have* to buy that coffee with a decentralized, trustless currency, you can use litecoin, which has 4x the throughput of bitcoin. It\'s fine if litecoin becomes centralized as long as bitcoin remains decentralized. There only needs to be one totally trustless currency. \n\n>Can you show how increasing the block size to 2mb is going to cut 6k by at least half or more?\n\nNo, I can\'t.

Remember that the LN works very similar to ripple in that everyone has to be connected to someone with the ability to clear transactions. Also remember that Ripple was charged with operating a money transmission operation without a license. \n\nAgain, absolutely none of this matters as long as regular bitcoin transactions are possible, which they always will be as long as bitcoin\'s blockchain and decentralized node network are still around.

If on-chain transactions are cheap, there will be no need to use the lighting network. If the lightning network becomes centralized, this will only matter if the lighting network is heavily utilized. If the lighting network is heavily utilized, this means that very few transactions are happening on-chain, which means that on-chain transactions are likely very cheap. The only reason people will use the lighting network is if fees or confirmation times are too high for their specific use case, which will be transactions like coffees which are low value but need quick confirmation. Transactions that need to occur on-chain will incur a $2 fee and take a few blocks to confirm, at *100x* current demand levels, meaning that if you can wait an hour for your transaction to settle and/or its value is greater than $20, you're probably still going to use bitcoin. \n\n>where individuals or businesses can be legislated against.  \n\nOkay, so *again*, don't use the lighting network for illegal transactions.

To be completely accurate: it spends the whole sum of an unspent transaction output. One address may have many of these outputs (although thats [discouraged](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Address_reuse)) That's just the way the system was designed.\n\nAn accurate analogy I've heard is that unspent outputs are most similar to coins in meatspace. These coins live on bitcoin addresses, and a bitcoin transaction is like melting down one or more coins to create new ones.\n\nI've heard Luke-jr talk about how he'd like to create a wallet GUI that had a few coin icons and the user could drag and drop them to choose which unspent transaction outputs to use as inputs.\n\n> If the block reward goes to the first person to solve a block, and everyone else working on the same block doesn't get anything, what mechanism prevents everyone from working on the same block at the same time, and only the fastest (most computer power) miner always getting the reward?\n\nEach miner has the block reward going to their own bitcoin address. That address is part of the coinbase transaction which is hashed to produce the merkle root in the block header. So each miner has a different merkle root and therefore are hashing different block headers.\n\nAlso miners don't necessarily have the same non-coinbase transactions either, because of latency or different inclusion policies.": 4, "Why does a bitcoin transaction from a single input have to send the whole sum of the address contents?

Each coin exists as an unspent transaction output on the block chain. Each transaction input references one transaction output. This creates a "chain of ownership" allowing any owner of an unspent output to trace the history of his/her coin. An output that isn\'t linked to an input of any other transaction is "unspent" and can later be spent.\n\n> ... then why can funds be added to an address instead of always creating a new one?\n\nYou can direct any number of payments to an address. Each time you receive a payment, a new unspent output will be associated with the address. It\'s a bit like putting multiple lumps of gold into the same theft-proof transparent box. To spend, you have to pull out intact gold lumps, but once taken out of the box a lump can be melted down and re-cast into any number of new lumps.\n\nIn a very loose sense, address = transparent box and unspent output = gold lump.\n\n> But why does this mechanism HAVE to take the form of wholesale transfers and new address creation, rather than "address A is now worth this new amount X, and address B is now worth new amount Y"?\n\nYou\'re asking for a "liquid" model of cash, which is how bank accounts and credit cards work.\n\nBitcoin uses a "solid" model of cash, which is how physical cash works. You could create a cryptocurrency that uses the liquid model (and AFAICT, this is how Ethereum works), but it would need to use a different underlying mechanism to establish authenticity of payments.\n\n> Since the block contains the same transactions, are not all miners working on the same block at the same time?\n\nYou\'re missing the part about the coinbase transaction. This is a payment to a miner with no sender. There is exactly one in a block, and it will be different for every miner. The coinbase transaction means that every miner works on a different block, and as a result must generate a different, independent proof-of-work.': 5, '> If the contents of each bitcoin address exists as an individual electronic token (like a coin), so that it has to be spent in entirety, then why can funds be added to an address instead of always creating a new one?\n\nIn order to stop funds being added to an already-used address, each node would have to keep a database of already-used addresses to verify. It would be much less scalable. Right now each node only needs a database of all unspent transaction outputs in order to verify that new transactions and blocks are valid.\n\nThe wiki page author is obviously annoyed about this as well: https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Address_reuse\n\n    Address reuse refers to the use of the same address for multiple transactions. [...] It also only functions by accident, not by design, so cannot be depended on to work reliably.\n\n> I guess I understand that the blockchain transaction itself has to be the mechanism which splits up and reassigns values, otherwise the information wouldn\'t be recorded in the public ledger. But why does this mechanism HAVE to take the form of wholesale transfers and new address creation, rather than "address A is now worth this new amount X, and address B is now worth new amount Y"?\n\nI think there\'s no other answer except *"Satoshi made it that way"*. Maybe he thought it would improve privacy or that it would scale better, who knows. I don\'t think he ever said.\n\n> Since the block contains the same transactions, are not all miners working on the same block at the same time? And if they are, then wouldn\'t my original question stand: what\'s to stop the fastest miner from ALWAYS taking the reward?\n\nThey do not have the same transactions. The first transaction in a block (called the coinbase transaction) is one which send the block reward, new bitcoins + miner fees. The miner sets their own bitcoin address to be the output of the coinbase transaction. So each miner is working on a slightly different block because each miner has a different payout address.\n\n> I think I may not grasp this issue due to my lack of understanding of the blockchain itself. My current belief is that each few minutes, all of the transactions that have been received by nodes on the network are compiled into a block, which miners are then doing the work of computing. Whoever computes the block first, and provides proof-of-work, gets the reward and the block is added to the blockchain\n\nYour understand is correct. There is one crucial missing point which is that bitcoin nodes will follow the blockchain that has the most proof-of-work done on it. This is how every node can come to a consensus with every other node of the history of all bitcoin transactions. Even if a node leaves the p2p network and later comes back, it can download the blocks that happened in that time, verify their proof-of-work and all other rules, and know that that is a true record of what happened. ("True record" here means if that node tries to trade bitcoins, other nodes will accept them)': 4, '> If the protocol HADN\'T included the ability to add funds to an address, how would anyone have been able to receive bitcoins?

Even if two miners are working on slightly different blocks because their own output address changes the content, they may be pursuing different targets but their own hash power remains the same. So the faster one will reach his target first, and if he can complete and broadcast his block sooner than the other, the network is more likely to accept his block as the next one in the chain, right? Which means that the block which the slower miner was working on is now worthless, since it won\'t be accepted by the network. If this happens repeatedly, how does anyone besides the fastest miner ever get a reward? Or is it just when they get lucky due to RNG?\n\nThe miner with the most hash power doesn\'t always win.

There is no way to know that somewhere out there a black swan is not hiding, disproving the rule and nullifying our "knowledge" of swans.

And yet, humans do behave -almost without exception- as though they believe that experience teaches us lessons. This is forgivable; there is no better path to knowledge.

I get it, but I think you\'re wrong.\n\nStaring at graphs; you might as well be staring at goats. But if you go out of your way and read stuff on the internet and in physical printings (e.g. the news, financial reports, etc) released around that time you might come to some sort of conclusion that would help you predict the future just a tiny bit better.\n\nI\'m not saying "look at this fucking graph, it looks like the beginning of these fucking graphs" lets bet all our money on this because of that.\n\nI\'m saying that if you learn something from this "deeper study" you can incorporate it with your current view of what influences the price of bitcoin. But you have to do it right of course.\n\nYou\'re pretty much saying that there is no correlation between increasing bitcoin prices and capital outflow from countries hit by financial strife, because both events we\'re looking at have similar graphs? Since bitcoin is basically digital gold which *(A)* is much more liquid than regular gold and *(B)* has a lower capacity than regular gold; is that really that big of a leap of faith to take? Or might it just be interesting enough of a hypothesis to look deeper, even if you end up being wrong?\n\nI personally think that both bubbles had people who wanted to stash their wealth before it got devalued by their governments and sought an easier alternative to gold without understanding bitcoins "max capacity" at those times. I did not draw these conclusions from "looking at graphs", I drew them from looking at events around the world that happened around the time of the two bubbles.\n\nSure we humans seek patterns, but if the pattern keeps repeating *time after time after time* as it has with the gold price around financial crises then those same patterns may also apply to bitcoin, but in another way because of different parameters between the commodities like liquidity. Do you also ignore the macro-economic cycle when making financial decisions? Because the long- and short-term debt-cycle pattern has been going for over 70 years. Of course not, you have to respect it.\n\nI\'m not saying bet money on this. I\'m saying it\'s interesting to think about.

(But I understand that you think that it is because of the comment I was replying to.)\n\nMy argument is:\n\n"Since both patters were tied to similar events it might be *interesting* to find out more about the events and keep them in mind in case something similar happens in the future. (Not to bet money on it, but to keep evolving your understanding of how bitcoin behaves.)"\n\nThere just might be a similarity between bitcoin and gold. There is a reason that people invest in gold during economic downturns, and no offense, but to say that the same might not apply to bitcoin because the events tied to some graphs are similar is just bad advice.\n\n5 years from now people who think like that will still be on square 0 when it comes to their abstract model of how bitcoin interacts with the economies of the world. It\'s like saying "let\'s not find out more about how the internet behaves because it\'s too complicated to understand" in the 1980s.\n\nEDIT: And oh my god to say that patterns are useless is simply just false. Sure you can not predict the future with a pattern but if you have 1,000 predictions to make a pattern quickly becomes very important.\n\nLet\'s say you\'re playing vs a casino bot that says it\'s fair (50/50) and you think you know a pattern, because some poor sod played 1,000,000 spins and roughly 49,5% of them he won. This might be a very real pointer to false information, but at the same time in an infinite universe it might also end up being a coincidence. But the chance of this is unfathomably low.\n\nBut from what I\'m getting you\'re saying the pattern of 1,000,000 spins is useless because it doesn\'t predict the next spin well at all.

That makes it interesting.\n\nEDIT: I guess both in some way have to do with people trying to escape their governments control of their money, but they can't really make a risk-based assessment of the bitcoin price?

I\'m not sure how realistic it is though in our lifetime. Govt is govt, it cant function without being able to issues its debt to pay for its stuff . You will never be able to pay taxes in bitcoin because it undermines the legitimacy of the government . govt fiat will exists as long as the govt owns land and military. In the end it comes down to "who can kill who" and part of the value of the USD is the fact the govt owns geographical assets with the military power securing value of the dollar as well. The whole point of abandoning the gold standard was to derive value of money form total land, military value and economic activity and issue debt. This is why they can inflate indefinitely and continue to do so. Bitcoin will co-exsist with fiat but its value will be much much higher, but fiat will not go away or the govt system currently with it . \n\nRegarding the candidates, Rand Paul is the only one that would get as close to all of the above future you outline. The article above is inaccurate about trump and banks. He is a developer. The business works via collateralize loans from investment banks to build projects and not hold up capital. His activities with banks are not politically but business related, unlike the others. This is common sense, we all do the same thing when buying a house and getting a mortgage only on a much smaller scale. Trump is actually the only real outsider and using his own funds in addition to being overtly vocal about corruption and fraud in the system. Sanders may come off as an outsider but  he was elected to the House of Representatives in 1990 and served until 2006 when he was elected into the U.S. Senate where he has served ever since. Sanders will quickly bend to the establishment when he is secured a nomination because he has been part of the establishment for 26 years.  Trump is the only non political candidate we have right now( if this is something you value ).': 1, 'I also posted this here: https://www.reddit.com/r/SandersForPresident/comments/4f7nr2/bitcoin_for_the_bernie_sanders_campaign/': 1, ">Didn't bother to read the rest of your post. \n\nPlease let me know if there was anything too difficult for you to understand if you do decide to read the entire post.

This is extremely dangerous because Trump will make decisions that he feels will make him look good in the eyes of the most powerful Americans. For example, Trump would have no problem displacing poor people to make room for large hotels and condos because these would be signs of economic growth.  But he would have a problem building better public schools in the inner cities because his elite friends would see this as a waste of money.  In my mind, there is one difference between Trump and Sanders: Trump has strong convictions, but he cares a lot about what his peers think of him.  Sanders has strong convictions, but his motivation is internal.  He doesn\'t care what anybody thinks about him.

Bernie's best chance IMO  to pull off an upset is for him to build up a large coalition of relatively small communities of people who disgusted with the current system.  He has already done a very good job with the young, adding the Bitcoin community would help him.  I understand that there is a little of overlap between the young people demographic and the Bitcoin supporter demographic, but from the comments that I have seen today, Bernie Sanders does not have  lot of support in the Bitcoin community.

If you listen to his speeches now, his message is exactly the same as it was 40 years ago.  Even though they are diametrically opposed politically, who he reminds me of most, from an ethical standpoint, is Ron Paul.  And an honest, ethical politician is what we most need to clean up this mess:  not a particular left or right-wing political ideology.': 3, "I had to lol at this one!  Pretty clever.  But I think that you misunderstand what Sanders wants to do.  What he wants to do is a reaction against an action that has already taken place.  \n\nWealth was concentrated by force, so it must be re-distributed by force (the force of law; not physical force).  What do I mean when I say that wealth is concentrated by force?  \n\nWorkers at a Ford assembly plant have very little power relative to the CEO and Board of Directors.  The CEO probably makes 100 times what the average worker does.  The worker just wants to own a decent home, feed his or her family, and send the kids to good schools.  One day, he comes in to work and finds out that he is being laid off so that the company can boost profits to keep shareholders happy.  His job will be filled by a laborer in Mexico who will cost Ford less than half of what he did.  This reveals the true nature of his relationship with his employer: he is a pawn; a means to whatever end that the company's leadership wants.  As long as he no longer meets their needs, he is dismissed, regardless of his level of performance.\n\nWhat Sanders wants to do is to re-establish in the minds or corporate leadership who is really important.  A corporation's priorities should be (in this order): 1.) its employees 2.) its customers 3.) its shareholders  \nWe live in a world where it is exactly the opposite of what it should be: 1.)shareholders 2.) customers 3.) employees  \n\nThis situation is sustainable only if you can continuously finds a different working class to oppress: if American workers no longer accept your BS, then move on to passive workers in China who will take it.  Once the Chinese workers get fed up, move to Malaysia.  However, the system is not perpetually sustainable because you will have eventually screwed over everyone.  \n\nWhat Sanders wants to do is as follows:\n\n*  to re-distribute what corporations have accumulated through greedy and unethical actions for decades back to the work force and tax payers that they effectively stole these funds from.\n* Make it much more difficult for them to do it again once the system is reformed. \n": 1, '>My vote for Sanders will send them  powerful message of "No Confidence" in the current corrupt system.\n\nThey don\'t give a fuck about your vote, or a million Sanders voters, truly.': 1, '> "we want to bring the poor out of poverty, but the system depends on the captive poor labor remaining poor." - This is just not true, people have to earn their way through life and there are more govt programs now to help with this than ever in history .\n\nWhen I made this statement, I was referring to the global system, no just the U.S. system.  But the same thing happens repeatedly:  rich nations prey on poor nations, rich elite in the U.S. prey on poor Americans.  The problem isn\'t the social system: it is fundamentally an ethical problem: people don\'t know right from wrong, or if they do know right from wrong, they choose to ignore it.  Go to any airport in the United States and look at who is cleaning the toilets.  You will see a trend.  It is not because these people were born to do this: it is because these are jobs that a lot of people think are beneath them.  In an unethical system, there is a strong incentive to keep the people who you think should be a the bottom perpetually at them bottom.  You can look at advertising and you can clearly see who society thinks belongs at the top.  A few people not of that select group will rise up, but the overwhelming majority of the "lower caste" will be systematically kept there.  How is this done? Through grossly inadequate public schools.  Through antagonization at the hands of corrupt law enforcement officers.  Through subliminal programming and distractions to pacify them. Yet, in 2008, we found tens of billions of dollars to bail out corrupt banks. 2008 was an eye opener.  It demonstrate who was really important in the United States, and who is considered unimportant.  Do you realize that only ONE banker went to prison for the 2008 financial crisis in the United States?  How many young people of the "lower caste" are arrested on a daily basis for much smaller trangression than the banking industry committed.  The priorities in the global economic system are screwed up, and they inevitably result in the concentration of wealth in the hands of a small elite.\n\nAre taxes the solution? No.  The solution is to develop an un-gameable system where all actions taken at a policy level are transparent.  Bitcoin is the first step in developing such a system.  The next step is to make all actions that are taken for the public good the be programmable, transparent, and verifiable.  For example,  if I pay paxes to the U.S. government in Bitcoin (think 20 years from now),  I can send those to the U.S. government as part of a smart contract.  My tax funds cannot be used for the building of bombs or any other activity that will result in the intentional death of another human being.  Perhaps more precisely, I can specify that my taxes can only be used for infrastructure projects in the United States, such as building roads.  Then I can easily track my Bitcoins from my wallet to the wallet of the road construction crew.  The transactions have to be auditable and publicly signed by government officials.  So if an official lies about the Bitcoin address of the road crew, a permanent and unalterable record of his/her discretion exists on the blockchain.\n\nSo why is Bernie Sanders a better option to bring about this reality about than the other three.

So their only option for survival is to work at menial jobs for slave wages.  The system is intentionally designed so that the majority of the world's population will work to concentrate wealth in the hands of an elite minority. Why do Apple and other large corporations build their products in China, and other countries with a poor labor force?  Because they know that the poor are a captive audience.

Yes, gun control would make things slightly more difficult for criminals, but most criminals would just find ways of bypassing the laws. 419 scammers existed before Bitcoin, for example, and they did things like convince people to not contest a check until it was too late to reverse, or require a wire transfer, or require cash in the mail.
