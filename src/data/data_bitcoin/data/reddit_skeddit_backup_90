Some places, IT companies like Microsoft, make you enter your time in a Web browser internal network application. With that setup I used to get paid weekly as a temp. But the majority of businesses use Paper time cards still. (Which most people are really bad at turning in.) So, this part could be improved In some cases, but a large% of employees are incapable of using a computer effectively, and would not turn in digital time cards on the regular either. \n\nIn any case, assuming you have digital time cards, someone still needs to manually double-check that everyone has entered their time for the day-week-month. Then they have to process any deductions that happened the day they happened, which could be room and board or commissary items (Smokes or Food or Work Gloves-safety gear not included by the company).\n\nThen they need to process taxes on every person, but those taxes are dependent on certain monthly income limits. You need to know when to stop taking unemployment taxes and Medicare taxes (but not social security tax unless you hit 200k a year or whatever that super high end is now). Then, and this is an important part for businesses, you have to pay those taxes + plus the employer added taxes on top of it, Immediately. \n\nSo a recap of what daily paychecks would do to make my life a living hell- Every time card would have to be turned in promptly at the end of the day (And either be hand inputted as I have to now, or digitized and entered by the employee daily). I would nend to know every expense an employee has, down to the penny, basically immediately as it happened. I would need to queue up 50+ deposits (presumably of bitcoin, since that\'s the context here). And then I would have to be paying Payroll tax on those paychecks EVERY SINGLE DAY, or at least every Wed and Friday for all checks issued. \n\nThis doesn\'t take into effect the cost of the physical  checks I have to print to run payrolls, or the time it would take for me to inefficiently run your wages every day when it barely takes longer to do it a week or 4 at a time.

That makes transaction fees mostly a zero-sum game, rather than a positive-sum game (though over the long run, higher fees also means more hashpower is being used to secure the chain, so it\'s not entirely zero-sum).\n\nWhether "the fee market" is a "myth" depends on what you mean by "the fee market":\n\n* If you mean "fees are determined by market forces" (which is what I mean by it), then I think I\'ve shown it\'s somewhat true for a significant minority of transactions. I think that\'s new information compared to Rusty\'s post a couple of months ago.\n* If you mean "higher fees will mean more transactions", then it\'s certainly a myth -- bitcoin\'s consensus rules cap the transactions per unit time by having a fixed blocksize and a fixed average number of blocks per unit time. 2MB doesn\'t change that, nor does 8MB or 20MB and doubling each couple of years. Limiting transactions per block based on expected marginal cost of orphaning might, though that gives a huge incentive for centralisation, and some of the flexcap proposals might also.\n* If you mean "fees are sufficient to pay for hashrate as the subsidy reduces", that\'s an entirely different (and IMO more important) question.': 1, 'There are lots of goals for "bitcoin":\n\n* decentralised: have a store of (transferable) value that can\'t be broken by inflation and manipulation by the powerful\n* speedy: be able to send money anywhere instantly, rather than having to wait for banks\n* cheap: be able to send money cheaply, without having people skim large chunks off in fees\n* programmable: be able to have automatically enforced financial contracts\n\nLong term, I don\'t think Bitcoin can compete on speedy and cheap: if you want to do proof-of-work to have security, then if you also want speedy, you\'re trading off against security which is generally a bad idea. Of course, the programmability lets you do payment channels, which gets around this. Cheap is also hard: on-chain transactions have to be stored permanently by everyone, which is fundamentally more expensive than you need for a receipt for a coffee, where just the buyer and seller might need to keep a receipt for a few weeks/years. Again, second-layer, off-chain solutions let you do this cheaply on top of bitcoin, but that\'s still not really "bitcoin".\n\nThat isn\'t to say bitcoin shouldn\'t be quick or inexpensive; just that there will be other things that will be faster and cheaper.\n\nLightning (assuming it works) will let you be fast/cheap but will only be as "decentralised" as bitcoin is, and will only be "programmable" in very limited ways compared to bitcoin. To me, if you want truly fast/cheap, lightning is the solution, not fiddling with the blockchain parameters. Of course, any solution on top of bitcoin is going to want bitcoin to still be "cheap enough"; lightning won\'t work if every on-chain tx costs $1000.\n\nAnd if you want to retain "decentralised" then fiddling with the blockchain parameters is *hard* -- miners already worry about getting newly blocks downloaded, verified, and start building on top of them in a matter of 3 to 6 seconds (corresponding with 0.5% to 1% orphan rate, at 10 minutes per block), which is a bit nuts. Changing the blocksize to just 30MB (barely 5 doublings) might mean you\'d spend 3 seconds just downloading over a saturated 100Mbps link, using up most of your leeway before you even start verifying the block, let alone mining on top of it. (The idea is, pools can always verify their own blocks instantly, so it only matters for other pools\' blocks, and the bigger your pool is, the fewer blocks other pools mine; so if you can\'t do it in 3-6 seconds, a bigger pool can, and you\'re better off just joining that pool. Which leads to centralisation)\n\nI\'d be surprised if anyone working on bitcoin core (including Jeff and Gavin) didn\'t put "decentralisation" ahead of "cheap transactions", the question is more on where you draw the line of what\'s "good enough for practical purposes".': 1, 'This is interesting as a whole but I think the most surprising and possibly controversial conclusion is:\n\n> Paying higher than dynamically calculated market rates generally will not get your transaction confirmed any quicker\n\nPeter Todd among others believe keeping a smaller block size in the lowest level of the block chain will maintain decentralization at a higher cost (aka drive fees higher). This presumes (I think) that people will pay more fees for their transactions to get them propagated faster by inclusion in blocks sooner. But if analysis shows higher fees don\'t move transactions any faster, then the "fee market" is a myth and the only way to move transactions faster is to have bigger blocks so more transactions move per block.': 1, 'Actually what I meant by "fee market" is that you can pay more to get your transaction confirmed faster. What the OP link concluded is that this really isn\'t true past a certain extent. \n\nNow of course I know, as you said, that the speed of blocks can\'t be changed by fees. \n\nAnd I think you hit the nail on the head on this being different from normal economics. If you extend my definition of fee market above, the good in the market is space in next block. But the production of this good cannot be increased or decreased freely. There is a limit of 1 MB (block size can be decreased and often is, but at a direct negative impact to miner revenue).\n\nSo supply curve is flat but the law of demand says higher prices, less demand. \n\nNow bitcoin isn\'t in in a vacuum and isn\'t the only game in town either. If the cost to get in the next block gets exorbitantly high, people will skip bitcoin for other methods of moving value. And I don\'t mean altcoins. I mean sticking with traditional systems. \n\nLow cost of transactions is one advantage bitcoin has and cannot afford to lose if the eventual goal is wide spread usage.\n\nRealistically, there should be no block size limit and market forces should control it. That way the supply side of the fee market could actually move and you could still have low fees and fast transaction confirmations and lots of miner revenue. \n\nOf course if your goal (not you specifically but "you" in general) isn\'t fast, cheap transactions leading to wide spread adoption, then you wouldn\'t want to increase block size at all. \n\nMaybe (and this is of course speculation here) the small block camp doesn\'t have fast transactions, cheap transactions, or wide spread adoption as a goal. For example, Peter Todd is in that camp I believe and he said (on a podcast... Can\'t remember which) that he cares more about decentralization than cost of transaction.

In my opinion, this issue is bigger than the current blocksize issue and, if ever addressed, will cause a much larger and more heated debate.\n\nThe definition of fungibility is that all coins are perfectly interchangeable. That is, no coin has different properties. Or, the history (taint) of a coin shouldn\'t affect its value. Bear in mind that cash is also fungible, even though it has serial numbers, because it is enforced by the law. \n\nUnless you have privacy/anonymity enforced (and thus mandatory) on the protocol level, "solutions" such as Confidential Transactionswill, Coinjoin, and Joinmarket will only slightly improve fungibility because one can still differentiate between certain coins. That is, merchants could choose to only accept coins with a transparent (or "clean") history. Therefore, something optional is only a slight improvement to fungiblity. In addition, miners could for instance blacklist certain types of transactions (CoinJoin) and only allow transparent transactions.\n\nIn addition, an example of why fungibility is very important:\n\n\n>Let\'s say Alice sells a painting on OpenBazaar that is bought by Bob. Alice assumes Bob is a law abiding citizin and thus sends her BTC to Coinbase to exchange them for US dollars. However, what Alice didn\'t know is that Bob isn\'t the law abiding citizen that she thought he was. That is, Bob occasionally sells some illicit stuff on the darknet markets and used his proceeds to buy the painting. As a result, Alice gets flagged by Coinbase for trying to sell "tainted" coins.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\nEDIT: To add, Chainalysis certainly isn\'t the only company doing blockchain analysis:\n\n\n>This is becoming a very crowded field.

So I'd imagine it working like bitcoin multisig transactions, but maybe with slightly different rules. The control key, the private key you control and can use for different things associated with your identity, it can transfer your identity to another control key but when in an escrow it can't change the other keys by itself, for the other keys to be changed they would require 2 or more signatures (depending on how much security is wanted). So for example, Bob could put his identity in escrow with his parents keys, if his key is later compromised he could create an identity transaction to transfer his identity to his new key and then contact his parents so they can use their keys to sign/validate the transaction. If later Bob wants to add his girlfriend Alice to the escrow, he would create a transaction adding her to the escrow and get one of his parents to sign it. He could also add friends, his boss, his future children, or others he trusts to the escrow, and he can also remove them.
