Yet, these places make thousands of hard earned BTC from people like you. People looking for the answer as to how they can make a recurring income of Bitcoins and know their investment is safe and secure.\n\nI have watched many forums and other communities, and I have built EXACTLY what everyone wanted, I built the first of it\'s kind cloud mining solution based upon YOUR needs, and I have corrected ALL the problems you have with all other cloud mining companies.\n\n[img]: https://stakeminers.com/images/stakeminersg.png" \n\nwww.stakeminers.com, is a business that a group of coin miners has been testing, and putting together for months, to bring you a perfect solution to all the things you hate most about other mining sites, and your solution to all the lies from cloud mining services we have today, A way you can finally say goodbye to the 60% to 80% maintenance fees cloud mining services charge you, a way you can finally know you will be able to make profit from your bitcoin investment. And not just a profit, but increased profits over time rather than decreased profits with rises in electric costs and rises in coin difficulty.\n\nNo more excuses, no more lies, no more crap and run around, why pay someone to try and earn Bitcoins when they are just going to take the biggest share of your profit and earnings in fees, we have eliminated all of these out of our program. \n\n[img]: https://stakeminers.com/images/stakeminersban.gif\n\nWe are not Whois Guarded, Our address is on the website, and our telephone number is available, we have direct emails to contact us thru, and for investors who provide substantial investments I have no problem providing other contact details, as with any real investment it would be required anyways. We have no reason to hide, we built a very strong, highly profitable business where we don\'t have to offer a referral reward because the referral bonuses are already hard coded into the structure of the business. We do not have 1 way you can earn higher profits, we don\'t have 2 ways, we have many ways your investment is backed up, and is able to bring you in higher profits without the need to reinvest.\n\nHOW DOES THIS BENEFIT YOU\n\nAt https://stakeminers.com What we do is a lot like all other mining pools, you are buying Staking power. Once you have made your payment we then trade whatever coin you used to invest with us and we buy coins we can stake on. As with most Mining pools or Cloud Mining services your investment represents a percentage of mining power. At Stakeminers.com however, you will never have maintenance fees, you will not have payout fees lowering your returns, in fact the difficulty will not even decrease your investment like other mining pools and cloud mining services. You will literally be able to increase your income without investing more ever.\n\n[img]: https://stakeminers.com/images/banner1.jpg\n\nBy combining coins into one wallet, we enable investors the ability to stake more frequently at a higher rate of return on each stake. Like regular mining, Stake Mining has blocks that give rewards, the more blocks you find the more rewards you receive, the difference tho is in Stake Mining your rewards are larger and more frequent than like regular mining. By holding a large volume of coins in one wallet you stake more frequently and you stake much higher amounts, giving you returns that sometimes are bigger than hardware mining and certainly larger than any other Cloud Mining service out there.\n\n[img]: https://stakeminers.com/images/okblbn.png\n\nFor a full run down on how the system works we have a complete [HOW IT WORKS] (https://stakeminers.com/how.php) page you can see how it is we can continue to earn you increased profits over time.

We dont need to worry about a DDOS attack as the wallets involved are not on the website servers, they are on a connection safely away from your common hacker threats. SO even if our site comes under a DDOS attack your investment is secure and protected away from their greedy little programming fingers.

It gives the  information that is most important to investors, it shows the coins and information of the coins we invest in, it has everything needed to provide investors with what they need to make an informed decision to invest with us. A simple website like most of the cloud mining scams is not what we wanted nor what we provide, we had to find a way to pack a lot more information in our site than any cloud mining service offers its investors. \n\nI would ask that before you make such wild accusations you at least ask questions to see if we quack like a duck, not just a one liner "smells like a scam" response. In order to see or think its a scam you need a lot more info than going to the site for less than 3 seconds. We advise no one invest without asking us questions actually, never blindly invest your BTC because a site "looks professional" that is the reason why it looks so professional, they want you to think they are professionals, that they conduct a professional business. Looking professional is exactly how so many people got scammed in crypto.

Reality of 2015 is that Western Union\'s online margins are competitive, and for some corridors, like USA-to-India, one of the cheapest. Yes, for transfer of $20, cash-to-cash, WU could charge 30%, but to do it cheaper considering cash agents-related and compliance costs would be very difficult. ': 1, 'Article text in case of WSJ paywall:\n\n\xe2\x80\x93A flurry of new payment products targeted at the developing world has revived hopes that bitcoin can gain a foothold in a promising market that has until now eluded the digital currency.\n\nSome of these initiatives deal with one of the main obstacles for bitcoin businesses hoping to crack into the $500 billion global remittance market: price volatility. Although bitcoin\xe2\x80\x99s fees are much lower than those of traditional money transmitters such as Western Union WU -2.04% and Moneygram, the fluctuation in the price can offset that if the value declines before recipients convert bitcoin into their home currency.\n\nNow, some firms are using high-tech hedging strategies to tackle this problem while others are just absorbing the currency risk and charging a fee for it.\n\nAbra, a startup unveiled at last month\xe2\x80\x99s Launch Festival in San Francisco, confronts volatility by turning people\xe2\x80\x99s smartphones into sophisticated, quasi-autonomous financial entities. These devices store money on the phone and then enter into a series of automated \xe2\x80\x9csmart contracts\xe2\x80\x9d with Abra\xe2\x80\x99s computers \xe2\x80\x94 computerized derivative agreements that hedge volatility and lock in the original dollar value. Abra aggregates all these mini contracts into a single daily derivative position that is sold to a large counterparty. This dynamic financial balancing act is constantly going on in the background between the phone, Abra and the market, yet all the user sees is a fixed dollar amount \xe2\x80\x93 or that of some other traditional currency \xe2\x80\x93 at which the money was originally uploaded.\n\nTo allow recipients to cash out, thousands of tellers have signed up in the pilot markets of the U.S. and the Philippines to carry a cash float and dispense with physical notes and coins in return for transfers to their Abra-enabled smartphones, says Bill Barhydt, the firm\xe2\x80\x99s co-founder and chief executive officer.\n\nIn a competing move, Robocoin, a leading maker of physical bitcoin ATMs, on Tuesday unveiled its new Romit software, which uses a network of physical bitcoin ATMs, designated kiosks that use web-enabled devices, and texts to recipients\xe2\x80\x99 cellphones to allow rapid cross-border remittance payments. The service charges a flat 4% fee to cover the exchange rate risk borne by the firm.\n\nComing at the problem from a different direction is Tether, formerly known as Realcoin, which offers a dollar-backed digital token that\xe2\x80\x99s imbedded into bitcoin transactions as a vehicle for transferring fixed dollar value. Unlike Abra or Robocoin, Tether takes on a debt to its customers, contractually promising to keep their digital currency holdings locked one-to-one at the original dollar price. It stands by this promise by building and maintaining a transparently reported reserve in dollars.\n\nEarlier this month, Tether signed a deal with GoCoin, an international bitcoin payment-processing firm, allowing merchants that receive payments in bitcoin to settle their trades in tether tokens instead of a more expensive dollar wire from a bank.\n\nBitReserve also accumulates a transparent reserve to back its fixed-value promise. But it uses a proprietary, cloud-based system rather than bitcoin\xe2\x80\x99s decentralized blockchain ledger as the infrastructure through which users transfer value to each other. Sensing an opportunity in remittances, BitReserve recently signed a deal with Mexico\xe2\x80\x99s Grupo Elektra ELEKTRA.MX +0.91% to use its network of department stores as outlets for funds that Mexican immigrants send home from the U.S.\n\nWhile those initiatives aim to shield people from bitcoin\xe2\x80\x99s price, other new projects encourage them to own bitcoin outright.\n\nOn Tuesday, Latin American social media network Taringa! announced it was partnering with bitcoin wallet provider Xapo to make ad revenue-sharing payments in the digital currency to those among its 75 million users who actively provide popular content.\n\nAlso this week, Chilean bitcoin exchange SurBTC launched with an ace up its sleeve: a $40,000 grant from the Chilean government.\n\nWhether any of these projects succeed in building emerging-market adoption for bitcoin remains to be seen. But innovators are clearing going after that market hard. (Michael Casey)\n\n\xe2\x80\x93It\xe2\x80\x99s official, more or less: MIT\xe2\x80\x99s famed Media Lab has become the principal home and funding source for the small team of developers responsible for maintaining and improving bitcoin\xe2\x80\x99s core software.\n\nGavin Andresen, who bears the title of Chief Scientist for the six-person core development team, announced on his blog Wednesday that he and two other core developers, Wladimir van der Laan and Cory Fields, had moved to the MIT Media Lab\xe2\x80\x99s new Digital Currency Initiative, ending their previous status as employees of the Bitcoin Foundation. The three other core developers, who draw salaries from different employers, will continue in that status.\n\nMeanwhile, the Bitcoin Foundation is going through its own restructuring \xe2\x80\x93 with two new leaders at its helm \xe2\x80\x93 as it strives to restore an image tarnished by scandal and the mismanagement of funds.\n\nBitcoin venture capital investor Brock Pierce has been elected Chairman of the Foundation, fresh after businessman Bruce Fenton took over as the new Executive Director replacing Patrick Murck, who resigned earlier this month amid tensions at the financially strapped foundation.\n\nMessrs. Murck and Pierce were among a group of board members who had sought to extract and separate core development funding from the foundation\xe2\x80\x99s unstable political structure. A charter that had given equal votes to members representing individuals and those representing industry was paralyzing decision-making and had left enterprise donors, which provided 85% of the foundation\xe2\x80\x99s funds, unwilling to continue underwriting the body.\n\nMr. Murck\xe2\x80\x99s plan was to create a separate, industry-funded institution to finance development while leaving the foundation to focus on promotional efforts, information and public outreach. But that strategic plan was scuttled after dissident board member Olivier Janssens released a statement declaring the foundation to be \xe2\x80\x9ceffectively bankrupt\xe2\x80\x9d and calling for an alternative overhaul model in which core development would be funded through a separate crowd-funding mechanism.\n\nMr. Janssens\xe2\x80\x99 plan never saw the light of day, either \xe2\x80\x93 mostly because MIT Media Lab Director Joicho Ito announced an alternative idea earlier this month: his institution would function as a reliably funded, neutral home for bitcoin development. Mr. Ito\xe2\x80\x99s initiative appears to have placated industry-based donors eager to see a long-term commitment to core development.\n\nFor now, the three developers will be paid out of MIT Media Lab\xe2\x80\x99s central budget, which is itself funded by donations from companies. But in an interview, Brian Forde, who will head the Digital Currency Initiative, said \xe2\x80\x9cwe\xe2\x80\x99ve had an outpouring of people who are interested in supporting it as well.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBefore taking this position, Mr. Forde was senior advisor for mobile and data innovation at the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. His involvement and those of other respected experts \xe2\x80\x93 including legendary encryption expert Ron Rivest and MIT economist Simon Johnson \xe2\x80\x93 have been welcomed by many in the bitcoin community, who see a chance to earn more legitimacy for the digital currency. It stands in contrast to the Bitcoin Foundation, which has been undermined by infighting, financial mismanagement and legal scandals.\n\nStill, Mr. Pierce said \xe2\x80\x9cthe foundation isn\xe2\x80\x99t going anywhere, though we have a lot of work to do.\xe2\x80\x9d With Mr. Fenton\xe2\x80\x99s appointment, he argued, \xe2\x80\x9cthe board has become functional.\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Pierce added, \xe2\x80\x9cWe did the right thing in choosing to spin out Core Dev.\xe2\x80\x9d (Michael Casey)': 2}, ('Skewed - Survey by ING/Ipsos paints bleak picture of bitcoin.

Ukraine, unlike Russia for the last few years, was a EU, and thus US, ally. Its citizens and most of its past presidents were pro-US. Even more damning to this theory is the fact that Ukraine has recently discovered vast reserves of shale gas, which a bunch of international companies, including US ones, were just starting to develop with Ukraine\'s blessing. Turning that country into chaos would be like US establishing oil fields in middle east, and then blowing up its own oil fields. Why would it do that?\n\nI know people who were protesting on Maidan, and who live in Kiev and rest of Ukraine who supported the protest. Their ONLY reason was because Yanukovich was changing the constitution and trying to set himself up as a permanent dictator. They would have protested with or without US involvement.\n\n> See Bit-license same as a pure ban. USA doesn\'t ban she just make it unusable...\n\nJust in one state. Bitcoin isn\'t even just American. And US bans on bitcoin would be as effective as already existing US bans on illegal file downloading.\n\n> USA again have attacked so much countries that I even don\'t recall how many of them... Russia not so much just defending itself.\n\nThat is blatantly false. Russia attacked Ukraine, Romania, Georgia, Lithuania, Poland, Korea, Vietnam, Cuba, Afghanistan, Belarus, Estonia, Latvia, Chechnya, Finland, Bulgaria, Hungary, Czech republic, Zimbabwe, Angola, Somalia, Mozambique, Syria, Salvador, Nicaragua, Chile, Dominique, Venezuela, and many others. Many of those it attacked the same way it did with Ukraine, by sending in its own instigators to start chaos, then when the population freaks out, pretend that it\'s the country\'s government attacking its own people, and then send in weapons and soldiers to "protect" the people from government, followed by either full invasion, or secret support, resulting in a takeover of government. Whom do you think USA was fighting in Vietnam, Korea, Syria, Afghanistan, and South American countries?\n\n> Russia is fine: no trillion debt, lowest tax on Earth, restructuring to be less dependent on oil (thanks USA and Saudi Arabia !) super deals with Chinese and new alliance.\n\nJust $600 billion debt, and no way to repay it because the debt is in USD, and Russian ruble crashed badly. Good luck to Russia with restructuring to be less dependent on oil. About 75% of its income comes from oil, and it doesn\'t have much of an economy otherwise. What\'s worse is that anyone with any brains leaves there as soon as they can, so they don\'t have any smart people to set up businesses. And corruption is so rampant that anyone who isn\'t smart can\'t even set up a business either. As for China, China knows who its friends are: It\'s the people with the money to buy Chinese stuff. China is currently angry at Russia, because China has been trying to hold onto territories that want to become separate (Tibet, etc), and Russia, a supposed communist ally, just showed Chinese people that if some group wants to separate, they should be able to. How is China supposed to explain it to its citizens?\n\n> Bank account get blocked if you are suspected to finance other side with BTC.

It\'s also why Russia is refusing to annex parts of Eastern Ukraine, despite those areas also having high votes for wanting to join Russia. And why is it any of Russia\'s business if an independent country wants to join NATO?
