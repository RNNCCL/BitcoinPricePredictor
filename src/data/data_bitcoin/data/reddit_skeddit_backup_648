They're probably using some API/tool at this stage. In early development, say bitcoin days when the price was 0.05 - 10$ I'd say that might be more crucial.\n\nI would say that dealing with growing transaction volume is something that the community should start working to solve.\n\n> we are only reaching 70% of the block cap which means right now no-one in the network has any reason to upgrade.\n\n**Only 70%??**\n70% of our capacity is being used? Don't know if you mean max block size or average.\n\nTransaction volume is capped now at about 7 tps. We currently have a little more than 1 tps average in a day which is about 14%.\n\nWhichever it is, if bitcoin is going to succeed and gain traction, it's easily conceivable that bitcoin will need higher limits somewhat soon. Changes to the network, especially ones like these need to have time to be ironed out properly.\n\nAlso, with more transaction volume, we can have more transactions and thus start moving towards higher overall miner fees, which will have to start replacing rewards as we approach another halving of rewards.": 1, "> No single miner can overwhelm the network with data, as the block will scale back swiftly after.\n\nI believe this is wrong. It doesn't matter how many blocks the data is split into, the miner can overwhelm the bandwidth of other miners.\n\nThere has to be a limit (either hardcoded or economic), otherwise miners with the highest bandwidth will be incentivized to knock other miners off the network.\n\nI like the proposal (that i heard from /u/justusranvier ) to limit block size economically. So, the client would stop relaying transactions and blocks for free, it would require a micropayment channel be opened with its peers. Peers could exchange block-for-block (or tx for tx) the same way bittorrent does. Or if one peer just doesn't have any fresh data to trade, it could use bitcoin instead. \n\nThat will stop miners from trying to artificially inflate block sizes, because a huge block will cost more to relay, and will be less likely to be relayed by nodes that can't or won't pay for it. It will necessarily cost more to relay, because any client that chooses to relay it will have to give up relaying several smaller blocks (due to bandwidth limitations).

Secondly Gavin doesn't even decide anything so the political problem was introduced by you. Thirdly I think raising the block limit 20 fold is the right thing to do. If he says the network can handle it then I believe him. So while scalability is fixed in a number of ways simultaneously I think raising the limit is the right thing to do for now.

So it becomes a big incentive for early adopters to "pump" bitcoin in the hopes of attracting ever increasing numbers of new adopters in order for the price to increase.  Those new adopters then become the "next" early adopters and the same pattern goes on etc.\n\nNow compare that mechanism to another financial asset like Microsoft.

If you view it as an investment and wish there was a dividend, you aren't the type of person who should be buying btc. \n\n-Do you really think comparing btc to a companies stock is an intellectually useful exercise? ": 2, 'The reason people call Bitcoin a "ponzi" is because they are confusing the term to mean something like "pyramid" scheme. The reason they think Bitcoin is a pyramid scheme is because of the intuition that bitcoins, in and of themselves, have no value. In order for them to acquire value, new people must come into the network willing to treat them as valuable. In life, if someone tries to sell you something that has no value and tells you you should buy because someday even more people will be buying these things, i.e., their only value lies in the hope that more people will continue to buy them, that is what most people would call something like a pyramid scheme. Bitcoin looks a lot like this. \n\nOf course, it isn\'t really true that Bitcoin has no intrinsic value. Blockchain technology is revolutionary, and if the whole world switches to using this technology it would dramatically optimize, streamline, simplify, and clarify every crevice of the global economy. You have to remember, the whole purpose of money is to lubricate economic activity by making such activity frictionless, and cryptocurrency is rapidly making people aware of how much of the friction intrinsic to the legacy system is just not inherently necessary.\n\nYet people point out that the currency is not the same thing as the blockchain, and that many different currencies can be made using the same technology. The argument is that bitcoins, therefore, in themselves have no intrinsic value, even if the underlying technology is valuable.  \n\nOK. But what is it that the blockchain actually does? It creates real digital assets, i.e., digital assets that you own directly without a third party, the same way you would own physical assets like gold. Prior to this technology that didn\'t really exist. The reason fiat money is debt based is largely because that is the only way to achieve transportability when the money is not made out of real assets. With blockchain technology, you can have money made out of real assets and be transportable, a merger we haven\'t seen since the days of gold money. (Incidentally, it is also why gold will never be a money again, as lacks the requisite transportability for the digital age.) \n\nFor blockchain technology to work, the assets that the blockchain is "made out of" must have value. If we always rely on the "well, you could always make another blockchain" argument, and therefore dismiss the value of any one blockchain\'s respective asset, be it bitcoin or dogecoin or ether or whatnot, then we are essentially saying none of them have value, nor ever will, in which case blockchain technology will never advance. \n\nOn the other hand, for those said assets to have value, people must recognize the value of the blockchain. But for people to recognize the value of the blockchain, the blockchain technology must work, and as I have said, for the technology to work the assets must have value. It is a chicken or the egg problem.\n\nIt isn\'t that the units of a blockchain, like Bitcoin, don\'t have "inherent" value, it is that their inherent value lies in the future, rather than the past. \n\nWith a pyramid scheme, the whole thing must inevitably collapse because the units of the scheme have no value and time fails to give them any real value. But with blockchain technology, the more people who participate in and use the network, the more profound and powerful the network becomes, the more it evolves, the more it innovates, the more it transforms.\n\nThis isn\'t a pyramid scheme, we are growing something.

Year later or so, i hear about it again, price was 3x higher but this time i got some.\n\nThat being said, adoption has nothing to do with the amount of coins being mined. Since they are still tradable, tippable and otherwise capable of changing hands there is the possibility of a economy.

Sort of like paypal works around traditional bank transfers. Seperate systems, same thing (the dollar, in this case) changing hands.\n\nIf you want to focus on the exchange rate, it is not capped at anything.

If Bitcoin didn\'t have that, then some other altcoin would have.  \n\nLets say the inflation rate of Bitcoin was 5% forever,  would you put money into it to "invest" over the next 5-10 years to bootstrap the technology?  Hell no.   Limited supply means that speculators can buy a percent of the overall tokens for good.  It is like owning part of a startup.    AKA Bootstrapping.   Without bootstrapping, Bitcoin would have failed long ago.\n\nOf course, fixed supply will result in volatility, but this can be solved by using swaps, hedges, and etfs.  All of these instruments are in the works.  \n\n> Problem #2: Bitcoin uses Proof-of-Work mining.\n\nProof of Work is the only trustless solution. POS requires checkpoints and staking of coins.   Who creates the checkpoints?   Who do you trust?  \n\nYes, POW, burns electricity, but think about all the energy and manpower that goes into our banking systems to provide trust and consensus.   And even with all of that energy, it still only takes a few keystrokes for them to create more coin and depreciate everyones holdings.  How fair is that?  Honestly, I don\'t buy into that system any longer, it makes no sense.\n\n> Proof-of-Stake ... just as secure\n\nThere are several arguments that say that this is not true.  ( I don\'t have the time to dig them up right now, but google around and you\'ll find them)  There is also DPOS(bitshares) which is interesting and they claim that their consensus algorithm is better by being more distributed.  But again, do you trust Bitshares?  They are a for profit company running their own chain with their own agenda.\n\n\n>  structural/critical flaws of Bitcoin.\n\nI guess this is the prime disagreement.  What you guys see these as flaws, supporters see as being revolutionary features.\n\nFixed supply, in a world of endless money printing, creates a huge value proposition for bitcoin.  POW means that we don\'t have to trust anyone.\n\nRipple and Stellar for example have amazingly efficient consensus algorithms, but they control the network and own majority of their tokens.  Do you trust Ripple or Stellar to be at the center of the crypto currency market?   I sure as hell don\'t.  \n\nWho do you trust to be at the helm of your financial system?

Problem is unlikely to ever be fixed.\n\nProblem #2: Bitcoin uses Proof-of-Work mining.\n\nSolution: Requires recognition that PoW is environmentally wasteful and likely to lead to centralization as established providers drop out of the arms race.

Miners unfortunately have an incentive to hold on to PoW until the bitter end to protect their capital expenditures in mining equipment.

(In computing science and programming, it is known that tight coupling creates *brittleness* and it is a computing science problem.) This requires a *decentralized system of trust*, or a decentralized network. The practical implementation of it in C++ was very geeky, intellectual exercise.

The problem with things like Gold and Bitcoin is that they have no fundamental purpose.  If both were to be erased instantly, the world would go on as we know it.  Gold is an arbitrary, shiny metal that humans mostly (~90%) use in jewelry - there is no fundamental need for it other than a few industrial applications that are few and far between.  Something like Oil and Wheat on the other hand are fundamental to our species existing at this point.  But as you say, they are capital intensive, which right now with oil plummeting - the more difficult (and thus expensive) means of drilling oil in comparison to say cheap, conventional methods, will drive some oil producers out of business.  But oil demand is relatively inelastic because we need it to for modern society to function.  The same cannot be said about gold or bitcoin, hence the need for people to "pump" it in order to keep up demand in the face of a constant selling pressure.  But gold in comparison to bitcoin, is in far more demand - think of the constant need for jewelry, so there isn\'t the same need to pump it.  Gold has no intrinsic value, its arbitrary that humans covet it.\n\nAnd yes, there certainly gold pyramid schemes.

It\'s the same principle as sports betting.

Perhaps it would be better to describe your comments about Bitreserve and our Series B raise as a high-altitude acrid crop-dusting of flatulent skepticism.  Better?\n\nBut why so high-altitude? Why so negative? Why so flatulent?\n\n[Here] (http://redd.it/2onw8q) you are a month ago:\n\n>\xc2\xa35,200,000 raised from 68 investors, average of ~\xc2\xa380k per investor which seems way above average from doing a cursory glance through other investments on that site. Their profile on Crowdcube is also incomplete (no company data/info). I\'m therefore not sure if using them as an example of successful Crowdfunding is particularly a good one.\nAlso, \xc2\xa36,000,000 for 10% equity is pretty astonishing. Although they have a functioning, working product, they have just launched. Why are they now selling equity? Why are they not releasing usage statistics? I\'m heavily involved in Bitcoin, and from my experiences I am not seeing any traction from them in the communities. The plan going forwards seems to be just to burn through the money in operating costs, and hope they get a buyout offer sometime in the next couple of years.\nBitcoin businesses are also pretty much the currently riskiest businesses around. All it takes one mistake and huge chunks of the companies reserves vanish. There is also a lot of scope for fraud, a fact that can\'t be ignored for Bitcoin based businesses. The risk/reward profile here is totally off.\nLooks to me like a terrible investment.\n\nWhoa, tigre!  Forget for a moment that even a "cursory glance" would have revealed that your math was way off. So much negativity! Why?  \n\nAnd here was my response:\n\n>Hey Thomas-- My name is Tim Parsa and I\'m heading up the crowd-financing for our Series B. If you take a closer look at our pitches on Crowdcube and Venovate, you\'ll notice that the majority of the $10mm round is composed of investment by institutional investors. We wanted to open the round up to the crowd because we share Crowdcube\'s and Venovate\'s ethos of transparency and inclusion. We don\'t believe that the chance to invest in world-changing tech companies should be the purview of just super-connected angel investors and Silicon Valley VC\'s. So your math is off on the average investment per Series B investor--we have over 100 small investors from the crowd-financing platforms, but in aggregate they make up a small fraction of the round.\nAs to your question regarding why we are raising funds, the simple answer is working capital for expansion. We did a seed round back in 2013 to build the prototype and set up a solid corporate structure. We did an A round in the start of 2014 to launch a private beta and hire key positions to get us ready for a public launch. Now we\'re growing fast and need capital to hire additional engineering resources and for other uses that are laid out clearly in the forums on Crowdcube.\nAs for usage statistics, we are 100% transparent with regard to the value that enters our system, how its converted, when it leaves, as well as the assets in our reserve that substantiate the value of the virtual assets we enable. We\'ve been open for just about two months and the value in our system has grown exponentially, as have our active members. Check out www.bitreserve.org/transparency for more details.\nThanks for your interest in Bitreserve and I hope you become a member and an investor.\nRegards,\nTim\n\nI\'m curious how you formed your negative opinions about us without 1. using the product or 2. reviewing our pitch on Crowdcube carefully enough to get some simple math right. If you take the time to do either, I have little doubt that you will understand why so many smart people were and are eager to invest in Bitreserve\'s Series B.\n\nIs there something behind your criticism and unwillingness to engage other than a healthy (and truly welcome) skepticism?  If so, by all means let\'s get it out in the open-- transparency is a core value at Bitreserve. What don\'t you like about Bitreserve, Thomas? \n\nRegarding your questions:\n\n1. **Valuation**: See above and also (quoting from a similar question from the CrowdCube forum, which I\'m guessing you didn\'t bother to peruse): *"Valuation of a company is always a subjective exercise. We based ours on several factors, including our Series A valuation, demand for our Series B from institutional investors, and valuations of recently-financed companies in the virtual currency space. Indeed, we like our prospects a whole lot better."*\n\n2. **MAU\'s**: We\'ve only been open to the public for 3 months. Do you think MAU\'s is a helpful metric to determine valuation?\n\n3. **New Users**: The graph is steep up and to the right, my friend. And if you\'d bother to take me up on my wager, you\'d understand why (at the cost of 3btc, which I promise to donate to wikipedia).\n\nCan you explain why you think it\'s misleading/unethical (loaded terms, Thomas!) not to disclose data that **you** specifically request, when none of the prospective investors we engaged with (on CrowdCube, Venovate, or the institutional investors who looked at BR) asked for it?\n\nI\'m sorry you won\'t be accepting my wager (it\'s an evergreen, just ping me at tim@bitreserve.org to accept it) and I\'m disappointed that someone as clearly smart and talented at your fine self is unwilling to even check out Bitreserve. Smart developers like you have been our earliest adopters and dozens are already building on top of our API.\n\nIt\'s your right to tell the world that you think we suck and that we\'re over-valued and that anyone who invests in Bitreserve is a moron.\n\nBut to do so without bothering to give a careful read to our investment pitch and without ever using Bitreserve, well that seems a little...what was that phrase you used...?\n\nKind regards,\n\nChange money, change the world!\n\nTim    \n': 2, 'A company is only worth what its investors are willing to pay.

(Single nodes can sometimes be confused, but dispersed consensus world be very difficult to defeat.)\n\n>* Mining-related double spend attacks are very expensive too successfully pull off without detection (and become exponentially more expensive every ~ 10 mins), so waiting for multiple confirmations for a small transaction is overkill.\n\n>* The 6-confirmation "gold standard" is derived from an acceptable risk of 0.0001%, based on an assumption that a malicious miner does not control more than 10% of all hashing power (which doesn\'t necessarily hold anymore). This is lower than the degree of risk of an average credit card transaction, so it generally fine.\n\n>* Anyone mining btc long term, holding btc long term, has a distinctive to do things that would crash the value, like colluding with other miners to double-spend.\n': 1, 'Almost 100% of the time, in a face to face transaction, 0-confirmations is OK. \n': 1, 'And there are plenty that do so...': 1, ">If you are online its assumed you can just switch to your celebrity upskirt tab and fap away 10 minutes.\n\nThis is not the quality of service we need to accept.

Let's say the chances are 0.1% to pull of a zero confirmation after the transaction is broadcasted properly in the network. In that case to accept a $50 0-confirmation transaction costs about $0,05! Why let people wait up to 30 minutes for $0,05!\n\nAnd what about multisig services like greenaddress.

A malicious customer could issue a second transaction that takes his coins away from their current address, and the network may process this second order before the payment transaction.  The latter would be rejected as an attempted double-spend, but that news could take 10 min or more to reach the merchant.  By that time the customer may have driven away with the goods.\n\nAFAIK, Bitpay and other payment processors try to avoid the wait for for confirmation by monitoring the payment transaction's spread through the bitcoin network.

I am aware of cold storage, as well as things like TREZOR, but i haven't learned enough of the basics to decide i need that stuff yet. \n\nIt just killed my confidence when the first transaction i tried to send to my wallet disappeared lol. I mean, i got it back, but if i didnt have coin.mx to help, i'd be screwed. (Like if i was going between 2 of my own wallets, or a wallet to cold storage, etc.) ": 1, "There are downsides to Coinbase, no doubt. So don't take my word as gospel. I'm just here to help as best I can :)\n\nWithout knowing what the error was, I can only assume it was on the part of coin.mx. I could be wrong, but standard computer errors can't make the coins disappear if you were sending bitcoin, say, from Electrum to someone else.\n\nHowever, one time I tried sending coins from ANXPro to my personal wallet and almost lost $170. Instead of copy and pasting my BTC address, I typed it in and messed up a single character. What can I say, I was young and reckless. \n\nLuckily, because it took a little longer to process, ANX was able to halt the transactions. I'm more than happy that they had a processing timeframe.\n\nKeep in mind that instant may not mean secure. It's convenient, but there are always tradeoffs. I use Coinbase monthly and have had no quarrels. Their support has always helped me, although most of my questions are general inquiries. \n\nCircle is also apparently a good platform for easy, instant bitcoin buys. I've never experienced it myself. \n\nAlso, depending on how instant you prefer, you may consider setting youself up on an exchange. I don't know who to recommend for that, but BTC-e, OKCoin and Kraken are three that people generally experience positive results with. Bitstamp just got hacked, but they're back online now. I'd give it a few weeks before going back there just to be safe.\n\nAnd just general advice: Bitcoin is a new technology. If you're on the fence, only play with it with small amounts of money. The technology is secure but the user-experience is a little rough around the edges. There's a chance you'll have screwups and lose money on it, so only use bitcoin for what you're willing to lose. Don't invest your life savings in it. \n\nAfter you've learned the ropes with Electrum, consider getting a multi-signature wallet in a month. It's the most secure way to hold your bitcoins. Coinkite offers really easy multi-sigs (I say easy, but they aren't easy for the inexperienced) for free. BitPay also offers Copay, a multi-sig wallet that's pretty to look at and avaliable for mobile. \n\nIt's a confusing world out there. Don't be afraid to ask for help. The bitcoin subreddit has some rough characters lurking who will criticize you, but a couple of us are trying to change that. Hence this long ass text post with too much information. :)": 1, "I have used circle's instant buy, and it was, in fact, instant. No credit card linked.": 0, "Well that's why i'm asking, because at the moment, i'm still not quite sure how i feel about bitcoin. I tried to send 5$ worth of coin from coin.mx to my electrum wallet as a test, (since i'm new,) and it left my account, but showed an error message. Blockchain didn't show the transaction. I emailed them, and this morning it was put back, but the thought that a single computer error can cause currency to just disappear makes me nervous. I registered for both, because i was looking to use the coins that day, and coin.mx was able to confirm me for purchase, and get me what i needed right away. Now i'm just getting worried because of that incident, and the fact that everyone seems to talk about coinbase, not coin.mx. \n \n\n": 0}, ('Coinchat.org! - A community with coin!', 2): {}, ('Bitcoin Lives Up to CES Expectations', 2): {}, ('help recovering wallet', 7): {"I don't know what to answer to that.
