If you're unsure, you can confirm the device's authenticity yourself by auditing the source code or physically opening the device itself. Though this solution is one that may not always be within a user's capabilities.\n\nMore details on trusting the Trezor here:http://www.reddit.com/r/TREZOR/comments/2ewgt4/right_now_do_we_have_to_trust_trezor/\n\nRegarding the Casascius coins, I believe I read something about him using a method that would allow him to mint the coins with zero knowledge of the corresponding private keys...but I can't seem to find anything on that at the moment.": 2, 'If your BTC disappear from a computer and you have no clue who did it, then of course suing someone is hard. But the situation is different if you have a device in your hand that has some kind of backdoor that allows manufacturer to steal your BTC. You know who sold you the device and you hold the backdoored proof in your hand.': 1, 'this is all well and good (and probably one of the most well thought out and robust security systems for bitcoin iv seen), but i still dont see how it protects against the trezor manufacturers themselves being malicious. I\'m not an engineer, so maybe this isn\'t really possible, but if the nsa can intercept ups packages of routers and install surveillance chips and then pass them along, couldn\'t the trezor manufacturers do the same? This is from that article u posted:\n\n>"Any time a computer has to deal with untrusted information there is a risk that the computer will be infected with malware. The TREZOR is no exception. In order to limit the attack surface against the TREZOR, TREZOR communicates solely through a simple USB protocol. There is no WiFi or Bluetooth, no camera for scanning QR-codes. There\xe2\x80\x99s not even a fingerprint reader for identifying the user. This is all because we want the TREZOR to be as secure as possible. The fewer devices the TREZOR talks to, and the simpler its communication protocol is, the less likely it is to get infected."\n\nBut what if they just didn\'t do that for a few of the devices and installed something that COULD track all your info and send it back out to them? It just seems like the one vulnerability to any device made specifically for bitcoin is that some bad actor maybe involved in the actual manufacturing of it, rendering any further security measures obsolete. ': 1, 'well u r convincing me that the trezor, at least, might be the best balance of security/ease of use... so would u personally feel comfortable holding a substantial amount (more than 20) BTC on a trezor?': 1, "Yes.\n\nDisclaimer: I know Trezor manufacturers in person so I'm biased.": 1, "There are two possible attack vectors relevant to what you are saying:\n\n- Replacement of Trezor software.\n- Replacement of Trezor software & hardware. \n\nThe comment you cited partially explains how trezor protects you against these attacks. First of all, it extremely hard to replace Trezor software only. Everybody can build Trezor firmware from open source code, anybody can check firmware for backdoors and anybody can check firmware fingerprint. Also, it's not possible to load unsigned firmware into the device.\n\nAgainst the replacement of the entire hardware, Trezor protects you with it's simplicity. It's easy to hide a malicious piece of code in computer or router that runs millions of lines of code and has several chips with you never know what they do and what code they should be running. It's difficult to do the same with Trezor unnoticed. And the reason is that Trezor has single MCU chip that runs 20k lines of signed code. It's extremely hard to hide malicious code on such chip. I'm not saying it's impossible, I'm just saying it's hard and I would say that it would be found.\n\n\nAnd last, but not least, you should question the motivation of somebody installing malware on such device. Government agencies can monitor bitcoin transactions in blockchain. They don't need to have malicious code on Trezors. The only reason somebody would do it is if he wanted to steal from you. I assume the government does not steal from you (and again, I hope my assumption is correct). The government should be on your side and if somebody (manufacturer or company producing fake devices) steals from you there are government institutions that should work hard to catch the thief.": 1, "in the case of things like the trezor or piper wallets, im not talking about malicious software, im talking about malicious hardware. As far as opening the device up... well that COULD work (and i would actually like to see manufacturers consider making this an actually recommended step and make it easy to do) but that would require there to be a very simple method for non techies to look at a diagram of expected hardware, and match it up, and would also require that there is no way to design some kind of hidden hardware that a lay person wouldn't be able to detect. And that is basically my overall question... is it **impossible** for the manufacturer to dupe us if they wanted to?": 1, 'When we have multisig, you will not need to trust the manufacturer either.

For bitcoin to work, everyone needs to accept bitcoin, e.g. You can pay your suppliers with bitcoin,  people take bitcoin as a part of their salary. Paypal could very well make or break bitcoin, depending on the public adoption.\n": 1, "Sure, but bitcoin is a /lot/ harder to steal since  \n1 the secret number used to spend them is chosen randomly  \n2 you don't give the secret number to anyone, ever  \nWith credit cards  \n1 the secret numbers are generated in series  \n2 you give the secret number to anyone you want to send money to, in some cases you even give it over the phone (or fax) completely unencrypted.  \nSo in general you keep it from happening in the first place.  \nAlso, since you can't have a negative bitcoin balance (unlike credit cards which are always zero or negitive) you can put your bitcoins in multiple wallets and limit the damage caused by one being compromised just like credit cards.": 0, 'If this is such great news, then why the drop in BTC price?

Paypal is the one that needs Bitcoin, if it's not Paypal it will be someone else taking advantage of the opportunity that clear as day.  People don't see Bitcoin for the innovative technology that it is and that is simply underestimating the potential for growth it has in many different ways. ": 1, "Just copy paste it. This is not a good attitude towards someone who wants to learn more about bitcoin.\n\nDo not assume that everyone understands everything about bitcoin.

When I pay with credit card, I get 2% cash back. When I pay with bitcoin I have to pay Coinbase 1% fee and I get zero cash back. In addition, I need to make sure the price of bitcoin hasn't moved between the time I bought them on Coinbase till I make the purchase. It's just a complete no-brainer that I should use my credit card whenever I can, instead of bitcoin.\n\n\nAnd just to clarify, the businesses are not really accepting bitcoins, they are only accepting them temporarily so they can immediately convert 100% into dollars.": 2, 'There are many that do.

That way in the beginning people can accept bitcoin and turn it into fiat if they wish. Then little by little as they deal more and more in bitcoin they will just keep the bitcoin balances in their account so that they can bypass the fiat exchange fee.": 1, "> If this is such great news, then why the drop in BTC price?
