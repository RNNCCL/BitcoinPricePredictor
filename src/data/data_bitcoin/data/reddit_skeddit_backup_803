For this reason, even in the absence of legal tender laws, economies have often come to largely rely on one, or a small number of currencies, to act as mediums of exchange. \n\nHistorically, gold, silver and copper were the most common currencies.

It\'s largely why Linux didn\'t overtake Windows on the desktop. Android is doing well because there is a very large company pushing it, and ensuring standardization across different handsets. Otherwise it would face the problem with fragmentation too.\n\nFor an open source digital currency, fragmentation is doubly risky, because it also means the effective inflation of the currency supply. The more the market is fragmented across very similar forks of the original digital currency, the more currency units are in contention. Without some type of durable market advantage against copycat forks, open source digital currency will have difficulty maintaining value, and will therefore not be able to function as currency.\n\nThe best hope for cryptocurrency is for one currency to attain enough of a network scale advantage that it is preferred over near identical forks, and that it quickly adopt all innovations in the space to avoid being leapfrogged. That is the only way an open source digital currency will be trusted by the market to hold its value over the long run. Without that trust in its ability to hold value, it won\'t be able to compete with fiat currencies, and won\'t be able to change the world.\n\nAs for the criticism that this is an "argument used by totalitarians all over the world" - this is absolutely false, because no one is arguing for totalitarian measures to outlaw altcoins or imprison their makers.

That I can understand, because of the idea that bitcoin ecosystem provides the most strength and longevity. Could be that this is what Blockstream is aiming for.\n\nBut a new ethereum type sidechain?

Colored coins is sort of halfway towards a sidechain. You take a coin, mark it as representing a token in a different system (coloring it), then that different system treats transactions that use that colored coin as a representation of a share in a company, which enables dividend payments etc. It still uses the Bitcoin network, but other systems can track that coin and treat it as a stock. At any time though (for example if the company collapses and the stock value is erased), you can still decolor that coin and use it in the Bitcoin system as normal without repercussions.\n\nOne of the drawbacks of coloring though is that it adds to blockchain bloat by adding extra information, but if a sidechain could simply use the coin as collateral and then use it's own chain for it's transactions then the Blockchain can sidestep a great deal of potential spam/bloat, and allows alts with desirable features to sidestep the messy distribution problem by already having coins locked. They can then be unlocked if the alt fizzles out, fulfills it's purpose and shuts down or suffers technical problems, it means that people will be putting far less at risk when they use an alt, and can also exchange their coins back to Bitcoin without needing to find an exchange (thus avoiding third party risk) to do it.\n\nEssentially side/tree chains would:\n\n* Reduce bloat/spam on the Bitcoin blockchain, thus making Bitcoin far more scalable.\n\n* Allow the addition of new and experimental features to Bitcoin without altering the system or requiring hard forks.\n\n* Opens up innovation on the Bitcoin blockchain and doesn't potentially squander hashing power on other alts.\n\n* Allows Bitcoin holders to invest in alts with far less risk, and would also allow them to enter/exit the alt without needing alt exchanges to act as intermediaries.\n\n* On an economic note it would also likely make many alts defunct and boost Bitcoin's price significantly since alts would need to be backed by Bitcoin if they wanted to take advantage of the Bitcoin networks massive mining power.\n\nI'm not fully clued up on side/tree chains so I might be wrong on some of these points but I think these are the main advantages. Though there's still lots of work to be done, it's a hugely exciting prospect, I think if this functionality were integrated into Bitcoin it would be fantastic from an innovation point of view, essentially all the alts we know of now could exist (and easily coexist) on the blockchain and every user could take advantage of it's properties, rather than have to go all in on a particular alt and risk volatility, low security because of reduced hashrates, or other unknowns.\n\nEdit: One thing I should also add regarding what you said. Side/tree chains also weed out the the pump and dumpers from the true innovators while also rewarding alt creators that actually provide genuinely useful alts. Essentially this means that coins created in the alt, which are backed by Bitcoin would still have economic value as long as the alt exists, but people could also back out if they feel the alt is going nowhere, the flip side of this is that people that turn their alt coins back to bitcoins also permanently exit the alt, and can make the alt's coins more valuable because they are now more scarce, thus if the alt is truly useful in the long term but people stream out in the early stages, the devs that still hold coins will not lose value if their alt truly does become a innovative tool later on, that means that if late comers want to buy/use the alt coins they'll have to buy them through traditional exchanges, which will push up the price.\n\nEdit edit: It also means that an alt can still function securely even if transaction volume is low or the value of the coins plummets as miners could still find value in processing the transactions without it hindering mining on the Bitcoin blockchain (at least that is how I understand it).\n\n\n\n\n": 1, "I was talking about the necessity of some kind of a bank (middle man) and a regulation mechanism by the state/institutions for ages and I was always being down-voted to -273,15.

For instance if the "raining cash" is actually fake notes (IOU), then it\'s not a problem. Also, this doesn\'t apply to other services, for which I\'m sure they accept credit cards.\n\nSimply put, the payer\'s bank can initiate a chargeback (complaint, report of theft, etc.) and the club will have to take the loss as they don\'t pass on the credit. Assuming you are even allowed to offer such a service through credit card.\n\nIn general, the risk is different from service to service. Some can just terminate service (e.g. hosting), some can absorb the loss directly (non-scarce digital products, services that are practically scams, etc.), some reflect it in their pricing, some can deal with complicated disputes and others have the ability to win disputes easily using, say, delivery confirmation. If none of these works for their business type, they usually do a prior background check or a verification transaction, which usually takes days. This is far from uncommon.\n\nQuite recently, some services that fit the last category began accepting Bitcoin, and it is very relieving on the customer side as well. While you lose the ability to initiate a chargeback, you get instant access and some percentage discount in return. It\'s a trade-off, and it\'s especially helpful to have the option if you trust the company.\n\nAs a disclaimer, I\'m not an expert, just a consumer who have used all these options in the past.

It is like saying why should I use credit cards instead of cash. Well the answer to that depends on many factors, like your financial clout, whether you can get a credit card or not, the likelihood of fraud in a transaction, and the trust amongst the parties. The decision to use BTC or not will most likely follow a similar decision process. I also think that the way you ask the question assumes that their is only the extremes, to use Bitcoin (with no 3rd party middlemen) and using banks. I envision a world where we will have many more options. Ones in which hybrid models will arise where consumers will be able to pick and choose services that are important to them (utilizing 3rd parties or Decentralized autonomous companies). Where these companies utilize the low cost benefits of a distributed ledger, but offer many services that banks and credit cards offer (i.e guarantee of principal, mileage points, ease of use etc.) plus new services we haven't even thought of yet. One great thing about competition is it sprouts innovation. \n\nIn the end the Blockchain allows companies and individuals to move money, faster, cheaper and better then existing systems. History has shown us when you have these 3 ingredients, you will have a no shortage of adoption. I can easily see a day when SWIFT is replaced with applications built upon the Blockchain. Thereby reducing large expenses (Servers, IT security, software development, Compliance support, etc. ). In this scenairo you would be using Bitcoin and not even know it.

To whomsoever a private key to a Bitcoin address is known, the bitcoins it holds are far easier to control than dollars or gold are under almost any circumstance. This is because controling bitcoins is simply a matter of keeping a number secret and requires neither securing physical matter (as with gold) or the permission of issuers (as with dollars). Thus there is a fundamental agency problem with Bitcoin. Agents can disappear or simulate a heist upon themselves. They cannot rationally be trusted without extreme costs being imposed on them which are more stringent than traditional banks. Furthermore, agents must advertise their services and consequently become the targets of hackers. They must take extreme measures to achieve a level of security similar to that which an individual person achieves with much less.\n\nhttp://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool/bitcoins-rugged-individualism/\n\nThis is why there is an idea that Bitcoin will severely curtail or remove banks and/or government in the long run.

It is a nice bonus in the winter that may help recoup your capital investment cost a bit faster, if you are already mining, but you *have* to account for the cost of your miner, which you mention but don't actually do.\n\nYou are paying for the capital equipment cost of your electric, oil, or gas heater through your rent payment even if you are not using it.": 1, "I haven't had to turn on my furnace yet this fall. ;) This is the nice side effect of mining during the cooler part of the year.

The future of the market is inherently uncertain, any attempt to make exact predictions is akin to reading tea leaves.": 3, 'Now we have encouraged a lot of merchants to accept bitcoin, and we can use bitcoin almost everywhere.\nServices like Xapo makes bitcoin useable everywhere.\n\nWhat we need now is for people to be paid in bitcoin, encourage Bosses and companies to have bitcoins as possible payment. This is what will make bitcoin go full circle!': 6, 'The sooner people realize this, the quicker they will buy btc for the technology investment and not the price. Adoption will continue to rise and the loop will be closed. ': 1, 'People are mining Bitcoin like crazy. They are investing huge amounts of money, and as the difficulty keeps rising, any hope of them making back their investment keeps going down. It\'s easy to be completely disadvantaged when you compare investing in mining and investing in Bitcoin directly. Any mining done with a future expectation of rise in value will be less than simply putting that amount of money into buying bitcoins directly.\n\nSo, unless a miner is making a profit right now, they should shut down. However, I believe there are people who heavily "invested" in mining, which makes no sense, because time is the greatest enemy to mining. If you don\'t immediately make money with it, it\'s a poor proposition to make money with it in the future.\n\nAnd so, as the electricity bills come in and the realization that you are being squeezed out of the market, the mining has to slow or shut down. With that comes the sales of bitcoins, because, if not for anything else, they invested for the goal of making money. They don\'t want bitcoins, they want ROI. And as there is no ROI, they dump whatever they can get for their coins, to mitigate the loss.\n\nA healthy slowdown of bitcoin price due to hyperbolic mining market is a good thing. It will settle down more, as more miners wake up and leave, while only a few are left able to compete and stay profitable at all times. It\'s also possible that the only people left mining are people who do it at a fully negative ROI, and purely because they love bitcoin and want to support it.\n\nThen all the giant investment server farms all leave, because these server farms were built for the sole purpose of making their investor filthy rich. They are not doing it for charity.\n\nThe beauty of it is, once everyone is just doing it for charity, it all balances out, takes greed out of the equation, and bitcoin becomes a nice, distributed system (in terms of mining) again without a few big players at the top.\n\nI hope that bitcoin prices continue to stabilize, and if that means it needs to go down due to over-mining, then so be it. I don\'t care about miners and their profits.': 1, 'Great read and I also love the author! ': 0, 'I don\'t think we should worry about the price. Lots of people worry about it because they lost money on their "investment".\n\nThese are not the people who can and probably will seriously adopt bitcoin and make it a big deal.
