No, because Visa will have to enforce KYC, which means they will need your name, SSN, date of birth, country of origin, etc.  Anyone who does not meet Visa's criteria will be denied access to the system.  Basically anyone who can't get a Visa card will also be locked out of Visacoin.  This includes entire countries.\n\nVisa running all of the nodes themselves would be pointless and nonsensical.  The point of having a decentralized network of miners is to allow the individual participants in the network to reach consensus that is mathematically verifiable by anyone and does not require trusting a central party with your money.  Visa already has consensus with itself.  Any mining consensus that Visa achieves would be meaningless theater.  If Visa controlled all the mining nodes, Visa would be able to block any transaction from occurring, freeze money, seize funds, etc.\n\nThe whole point of Bitcoin is that no one, not even the creator of the network, can do those things.

That mindset is totally inaccurate.\n\n>People want things that improve their lives, yes, but they also want things that are flashy, trendy, and most importantly, easy to use.\n\nThis is only looking at the problem from the POV of a developed nation. For much of the world, the idea of securing a financial service is a pipe dream. The people who are paying double digit percent fees to get money to their families couldn't give a shit what's trendy or flashy. This isn't a fashion show.\n\n>When it comes to user-facing applications, open source loses to for-profit most of the time. What operating system do most people use? What apps do they install on their phones? What office suite do they have?\n\nWell, I think the majority of operating systems currently in use are Linux-based. That may not be the case for end-user laptops/desktops, but that's absolutely the case for major computing infrastructure and mobile industries.\n\nOf course closed-source projects generate some solid UX, but we pay for that. It just isn't monetary in nature. We pay for that by requiring worldwide discussions about privacy, security, and a general discomfort that we're being watched.

You may try and argue that doesn't matter, but I contend that matters a lot for enabling truly global interoperability.\n\n>If you think the average person would care that much about VISA controlling the entire system, I would have to disagree with you. It\xe2\x80\x99s what people are used to.\n\nThe average person will care a lot when they actually understand there's a system that doesn't wield that kind of control. People already despise banks.

Additionally most mainstream economists do not really follow the Austrian school as Satoshi seemed to: they mostly seem to think Keynesian stimulus is a great idea, and that\'s not really compatible with Bitcoin\'s monetary policy.\n\nWhat you actually want is someone who will keep developers grounded in reality, user focused, etc. And this is a common need. In Silicon Valley these people are called product managers. They are meant to be technical enough to understand what\'s possible, not be bamboozled by developers etc, but not to do the programming themselves. And they get to tell the programmers what to do. Their goal is to think about what users want, need and how the user experience should be ("UX" is a vague term that encompasses what the user interface looks like but also things like how notifications work, what features are in and what are fluff, etc).\n\nBitcoin does not have a product manager. In the early days Satoshi was that guy. I have a bit of product management experience from when I worked on consumer products at Google, but if the right person turned up with good suggestions and the right experience, then I\'d be happy to listen to them (not always obey though!).\n\n> Poll like integration for Bitcoin clients. A possibility for everyone with Bitcoin to vote on important decisions.\n\nAgain I see where you\'re coming from, but there are practical issues. One is that nobody can tell volunteers what to do (as we are seeing currently). A robust way to poll the userbase would certainly help ground arguments and provide useful data for decision making, but it\'s hard to know how exactly it would work on a technical level. Proof of stake might be one way to go but there are lots of technical issues (cold wallets, multisig wallets, wallets that don\'t implement the voting feature etc).\n\n> Letter of Manifest which have to be signed from every member with GIT-Admin-Access.\n\nYes, XT will have a manifesto once the new release is done.\n\n> Bitcoin-XT client should ask on installing if you want the full version or the light version.\n\nThis has been on the wishlist for a long time. But it\'s not really clear in the long run if it\'s best to do this, or if it\'s best to point users towards competing lightweight wallets like MultiBit. Competing wallets have many features beyond lightness, features like exchange rates support, TREZOR support, multisig, deterministic wallets, online help, note taking ability, address books, etc. So it might be best to just direct users elsewhere if they want a wallet, and focus scarce developer resources on the P2P node aspect.': 0, '>GIT-Admin-Access for well known economist.

Thus, gold formed a very efficiently movable medium for the transportation of a value exchangeable for other values, ultimately deriving, in one way or another, from human labor (with the achievements of warriors here also being viewed as involving labor).\n\n>Nowadays, however, few would propose a return to the actual use of simply the metal gold as a standard, for the following reasons.\n(i) The cost of mining gold effectively does depend on the technology. Recent cyanide leaching techniques have made it possible again to profitability mind gold at formerly abandoned sites in the U.S. so that it is now a big producer.  However, the unpredictability of the cost is a negative factor.\n(ii) The location of potential gold-mining locations may not be \xe2\x80\x9cpolitically appealing.\xe2\x80\x9d so it would seem undesirable to make a political choice to enhance the economic importance of those particular areas.\n(iii) There is some negative psychology about gold such tat even if it were the most logical choice after all, the unpopularity of the idea could be very obstructive.\n\n>However, right now platinum would be even better than gold, because it has more value per unit of weight.\nCrude petroleum could also be used for barter transactions, and in view of the present state of the global economy it would seem a proper component of an index of prices of internationally traded commodities that enter into the costs of industrial consumption.\n': 1, 'Nobody here thought he could be Satoshi.
