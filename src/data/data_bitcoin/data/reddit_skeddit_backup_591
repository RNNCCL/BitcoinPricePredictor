PoS is still ultimately based on trust, as Vitalik acknowledges. The argument of the PoS supporters is that a PoW currency is also based on some trust, in trusting who you download the client from, and that this is generally secure, and that a PoS currency's reliance on trust is only different in matter of degree.\n\nWhat's glossed over and not acknowledged, in my opinion, is that a PoS currency can be severely disrupted for existing users, by attacking the highly trusted parties, while a PoW currency cannot. Once users have to rely on people they personally trust for checkpointing, because all trusted centres within the community have been shut down or co-opted, the ease of use drops off, and only the highly involved members of the community will be left. \n\nAnd PoS can be directly attacked in ways that PoW cannot. People who once owned PoS coins can use the private keys that once controlled their coins to vote for a fork chain, at no cost to themselves. Buying up private keys that once held coins can be a very cheap (relatively speaking) way to create a fork. This contrasts with PoW, where it is very expensive to create a fork.\n\nThe proposed defence against this is to require stake voters to put up deposits, and for the blockchain to use trusted checkpointing in between deposit periods to prevent long range attacks by parties in control of private keys to old coins. The idea being that stakeholders won't cheat if it means they'll lose their deposit. Putting aside the centralizing tendencies of a protocol that relies on periodic checkpointing from trusted parties, the deposit itself might not be enough to prevent an attack. If the attacker can manipulate the algorithm that selects the future stakeholders, they can potentially control block selection for the entire deposit period. \n\nThere are so many unresolved issues like this, that I believe cannot be fixed, because fundamentally, a nothing-at-stake method is not secure, and has to rely on a different method as a back-up. Reliance on trusted third parties is nothing new, and does not permit secure distributed consensus on blockchains.": 1, 'A trusted central party does not need to act as a ledger in POS.

I think Voluntaryism is a better foundation than either.\n\nVoluntaryism is based on the Non-Aggression Principle, where Non-Aggression is: "Not bringing rivalrous resources (including human bodies) into physical conflict". What this means is, that a person cannot own a river, he can only have the right to use the river in a certain way, and he can only acquire that right if it does not interfere with the way someone else was already using the river. So that means he either has to use a river that no one else is using; use it in a way which doesn\'t stop anyone else using it in the ways they have rights to (e.g. if people are drinking from it, you can\'t dump waste into it); or to purchase the rights off of all the people who were using the river before him; or a combination of these as necessary for his needs (as judged by him).\n\nSo, this problem of people getting blocked off from resources doesn\'t happen. If someone builds a house or a factory, the rights work the same way, but in this case it is practically the same as ownership, because there\'s not really any way someone else can use your house or factory without interfering with your use of it. The land underneath either, you could only have built your house on if it wasn\'t interfering with someone else\'s prior use of that land, or if it would\'ve, you paid them off so no one loses out (indeed, everyone is made better off, at least by their own judgment at the time of transacting).\n\nA large proportion, perhaps most, anarcho-capitalists are also voluntaryists, whereas only very few anarcho-communists are voluntaryists; ancaps and voluntaryists even share the same flag (yellow and black, though they may use a different emblem atop it). People could easily live communistically as voluntaryists; even easier than they could under pure anarcho-capitalism (i.e. lockean homesteading, exclusive land-ownership), which is very similar to voluntaryism anyway.

The arbitrators also have an economic incentive to make unbiased decisions, since DRO\'s won\'t agree to use arbitrators who are known to be biased / corrupt.  DRO\'s decentralize law, essentially.

It takes nothing from society when you hoard money; in fact spending money is what takes resources from society. \n\nTo hoard food, for example, is to leave that much less food for everyone else. To hoard money is the opposite: you forego those resources to which you are entitled, leaving that much *more* resources (food, etc.) for everyone else.\n\nMoreover, from Bastiat it is also clear that hoarding bitcoins is a temporary loan to everyone other bitcoin holder, making all their coins temporarily worth more because there are that many fewer coins chasing the same amount of goods. And burning bitcoins is simply a donation to every other holder, as you have taken your claim check that entitles you to goods and services within the Bitcoin community and ripped it up, again making everyone else's coins worth more, but this time permanently.\n\nSo hoarding and burning money should be thought of as the very opposite of hoarding and burning resources.

You have a crown. What does it imply in your hands? It is, as it were, the witness and proof that you have, at some time or other, performed some labour, which, instead of profiting by it, you have bestowed upon society in the person of your client. This crown testifies that you have performed a service for society, and, moreover, it shows the value of it. It bears witness, besides, that you have not yet obtained from society a real equivalent service, to which you have a right. To place you in a condition to exercise this right, at the time and in the manner you please, society, by means of your client, has given you an acknowledgment, a title, a privilege from the republic, a counter, a crown in fact, which only differs from executive titles by bearing its value in itself; and if you are able to read with your mind\xe2\x80\x99s eye the inscriptions stamped upon it you will distinctly decipher these words:\n\n>\xe2\x80\x9cPay the bearer a service equivalent to what he has rendered to society, the value received being shown, proved, and measured by that which is represented by me.\xe2\x80\x9d \n\n>Now, you give up your crown to me. Either my title to it is gratuitous, or it is a claim. If you give it me as payment for a service, the following is the result: \xe2\x80\x93 your account with society for real satisfactions is regulated, balanced, and closed. You had rendered it a service for a crown, you now restore the crown for a service; as far as you are concerned, you are clear. As for me, I am just in the position in which you were just now. It is I who am now in advance to society for the service which I have just rendered it in your person. I am become its creditor for the value of the labour which I have performed for you, and which I might devote to myself. It is into my hands, then, that the title of this credit \xe2\x80\x93 the proof of this social debt \xe2\x80\x93 ought to pass. You cannot say that I am any richer; if I am entitled to receive, it is because I have given. Still less can you say that society is a crown richer, because one of its members has a crown more, and another has one less. For if you let me have this crown gratis, it is certain that I shall be so much the richer, but you will be so much the poorer for it; and the social fortune, taken in a mass, will have undergone no change, because as I have already said, this fortune consists in real services, in effective satisfactions, in useful things. You were a creditor to society, you made me a substitute to your rights, and it signifies little to society, which owes a service, whether it pays the debt to you or to me.

A small minority can have a massive influence because they have incentives to use the govt apparatus to benefit themselves because the benefits are focused on them, but the rest of us don\'t have the incentive to fight back because the costs are dispersed.  Example: a tariff can yield a corporation $1 million by raising the costs of 1,000,000 T-shirts by $1.

I bet it will really get them thinking in new ways. \n\nYeah, its a silly concept to most everyone, but the concept isn\'t really the point. The point is getting young minds to open up to the very idea of "what is value", "what creates value", "where does money come from", "why do we use money and what are its limitations", Etc.\n\nI think Andreas Antonopolus framed the idea in a very novel way: He said once that money is a form of social expression. Exchanging value with money expresses the desire to create a substitute for my work, place it in a different form, and trade it with another for something that I want. So in that way, we communicate. But how are we communicating efficiently now? How can we communicate globally better?\n\nEdit: I guess what I am getting at here is, when presented with an otherwise disinterested or skeptical audience, you have to realize that their basic mindset (like most people nowadays) is going to be, "well, ok Bitcoin. But why the hell do we even need it? I don\'t understand it! I don\'t even know what it is!". And now all of a sudden you\'re teaching all these kinds of different concepts in one conversation. Its way to overwhelming for virtually most adults.

You have to start this exercise assuming that every one of them most likely does not want to hear about any of this. So you\'re going to have to find a way to make it interesting, engaging, and manageable.\n\nBitcoin kind of sits at an important nexus of political thought, ideology, economics, computer science, and philosophy. And any proper understanding beyond simply sending and receiving it will ultimately delve into such concepts.\n\nHow do you conduct a class for children, let alone a series of classes for them on such ideas? Do you recall ever having a complex class series on currency, economics and philosophy all in one during middle school? I don\'t. So, ideally, a class would be kept incredibly simple and basic, using lots of real world examples creatively baked into a package that they can understand. So, lets say, a class on basic economics first, touching on what money really is, and how it is created, and so forth. Perhaps using examples from popular video games such as World of Warcraft, or Runescape. If presented in this light, you might gain their interest, otherwise I can almost guarantee they will drift off on you.\n\nPerhaps after the basics are covered simply, one by one (one for each class) then you can introduce the sending and receiving of it. And then talk about how that works. I would get on Khan academy and check out some introductory videos, and even view James D\'Angelo\'s videos as well. You\'re going to have to be very knowledgeable on the subject in order to simplify it creatively, in a way that harnesses their attention. \n\nAnd be prepared for some wacky questions that you may not have ever thought of, because children sometimes ask things that set adults off, because they simplify things in ways that our minds overlook. \n\n': 6, 'I find analogies work well if the audience cannnot understand the crypto.\n\nA bitcoin address is like a drinking glass.\n\nBitcoin value is like water.\n\nAn address with value in is is like a glass with some amount of water in it.\n\nA multisig address is like multiple cups welded together, with different people holding the handles - they have to agree when to pour it. \n\nA transaction is like a bucket.

I\'m also a game theory math guy, and what a few of us are calling a statistical economist.\n\nAnd, I\'ve also been into Bitcoin since around when Finney joined the party. I maintain a large amount of my wealth in bitcoin, and have done so for quite a while.\n\nI contend Yanis will indeed have to relook at Bitcoin, and moreover, I know exactly where he is mistaken. \n\n1. He has a very specific definition of capitalism, wherein it necessarily implies fractional-reserve banking, either directly by banks, or by people making private "money" and trading that as if it were the real deal, thereby producing ponzi bubbles. In the "real world", these are the CDOs and all the shit the bankers trade, along with the fractional-reserve banking. In Bitcoin, we have seen this already, many times. This is exactly what Gox was doing. Any off-blockchain anything, unless it is conducted in a cryptographically provable way, is this.\n\n2. The other necessary feature is the one to disprove the concept of a deflationary spiral, and one which is not properly understood by bitcoiners either, not that it matters. This is the fact that, when it becomes useful, it is trivial to extend the decimal precision to have sub-satoshis; and, that subdividing bitcoins into arbitrary pieces is 100% frictionless. Less frictional than any existing fiat, in fact. This friction is what exacerbates the cycle. Naturally, before digital money, this friction was significant -- this is the reason that economists (if they really understood it) say a gold standard IS, in fact, inherently going to be unstable eventually. \n\n(1) *can* eventually be mediated, by people not being retarded. Yanis will not know that it is even possible, because although he knows many things, he does not understand the maths of cryptography and what they imply. There is a mathematical proof that would convince him, actually (because he is the sort who trusts the math implicitly). No one has shown him this proof, however, and part of it includes the use of Byzantine-fault tolerant protocols like blockchains, and those are pretty new. BFTs, 2001, MIT; Satoshi chains, 2008 (you guys know, lol).\n\nThe other thing about (1) is, according to Yanis\' personal definition, anarcho-capitalists (as found in Bitcoinland) generally aren\'t really capitalists. He\'d probably describe it as a sort of digital, frictionless feudalism or something? The fact that no "capital" is magicked into the present by snatching it from the future, makes it not capitalism, to Yanis\' school of thought. Just as an FYI. He\'s not alone either; there are a lot of AnComs and AnSocs that subscribe to this view, and this is a significant vocab sticking point preventing our two camps agreeing more often.\n\nDespite Yanis\' current thinking on Bitcoin -- and it is also possible that he grasps it a bit, but recognizes that for most people, due to (1), they are far more likely to lose their shirts than escape the fascist economy as we\'d like, and is fibbing a bit -- he will come around, because he\'s rather a genius himself, and allows new data to change his beliefs.\n\nAnd, most of all, his policies are far more friendly to our anarcho-libertarian causes than any walking public figure, save perhaps Ron Paul, though he\'s more a figure, as unfortunately he was not ever in a position to do more than vote against bills.\n\nVery much enjoying watching Yanis do his thing so far.': 3, "Yanis Varoufakis is quite a piece of work. He claims the monetary system was a total disaster all throughout history, until governments finally discovered fiat currency, shortly after the crash of 1929, which, by the way, was caused by the gold standard, and had nothing to do with central banking. Apparently 42 percent of corporate profits being earned by the financial sector over the last 40 years has nothing to do with the governments having taken control of money through their central banks. When bad things happen in the banking sector under a fiat regime, he'll find something other than monetary policy to blame. \n\nAntonopoulos handled that debate really well, and never stooped down to Varoufakis' level or appeared defensive/combative. The comparison between the effect of the internet on the telecom industry and how he sees Bitcoin affecting finance was excellent.\n\nIn Andreas' talk on the current situation Greece, there's one thing I'd disagree with him on: Greece's current predicament is not, as he argues, due Greece's adoption of the Euro taking away its ability to devalue its currency during its recession. This idea assumes prices are sticky, and that without a central bank forcing prices down surreptitiously by devaluing the currency they use as a unit of account, the market is helpless to adjust prices on its own.

I think Yanis makes a very interesting point about the 1929 crash and how with Bitcoin there is no safety net for banks, which could be a large problem.  However, this is analysing the banking system using the conventional framework.  What Yanis fails to appreciate is that Bitcoin has some characteristics which make it fundamentally different from other forms of currency and thus a totally different analysis of the banking system may be required.  I will try to explain below.\n\nThe core characteristic of the traditional banking system, is banks\xe2\x80\x99 ability to expand the level of credit in the economy, by creating new loans and increasing deposits.  This is a core driver of modern economies and a key reason for financial regulation.  There is a risk banks lend out too much money in a credit boom and thus a safety net may be required to bail out the banks.  In the context of Bitcoin, it is important to understand the reason banks have the ability to expand credit, which is because users treat bank deposits in the same way as cash, enabling banks to expand loans and therefore deposits, at will.  People treat banks deposits this way for perfectly reasonable and logical reasons, in fact banks deposits have some significant advantages over cash, which I will try to explain below.  Many of these advantages either don\'t apply or only partially apply in Bitcoin.  There is no conspiracy or master manipulation by the financial elites; it\xe2\x80\x99s very much a product of the nature and characteristics of most forms of money that bank deposits are simply better than cash.\n\nBitcoin has at least five properties (listed below) which provide some level of natural resilience against credit expansion, which traditional money does not have.  This does not mean there cannot be a few dominant Bitcoin banking institutions engaging in credit expansion, it merely means Bitcoin may be more resilient to this than more traditional forms of money.\n\n**1. Security**\n\nKeeping money on deposits in financial institutions, increases security relative to keeping large physical cash balances at home\n\nBitcoin can allow a high level of security, whilst the user maintains direct control of the money without using third party financial intermediaries\n\n**2. Convenience**\n\nUsing the banking system, it is possible to send money effectively over the internet or by phone, for example.  If physical cash is used, then a slow, inefficient, insecure physical transfer must take place\n\nBitcoin can allow users to efficiently transmit money over the internet or even phone, whilst maintaining direct control of the money and without using third party financial intermediaries\n\n**3. Easy to exit**\n\nIn the traditional banking system, withdrawing physical cash from a financial institution is a long administrative process which takes time\n\nBitcoin can allow users to withdraw money from deposit taking institutions quickly, which may encourage banks to ensure they have adequate money in reserve at all times\n\n**4. Auditability**\n\nTraditional banks offer the ability to track and monitor all transactions, which can help prevent fraud and improve accountability.  This is important to many businesses and physical cash cannot offer this\n\nBitcoin\xe2\x80\x99s blockchain can allow users to effectively audit all transactions, without using third party financial intermediaries\n\n**5. "Hybrid banking" models** (perhaps the most significant)\n\nIn traditional banking models there are only two fundamental choices, 1. Physical cash which provides full user control of the money, and 2. Money on deposit at a financial institution\n\nBitcoin allows a wider spectrum of deposit and security models, resulting in a more complex credit expansionary dynamic\n\nPlease see some examples below of "hybrid banking" models:\n\n* Full user control of the money, where only the user holds the private key. e.g. Bitcoin Core, Blockchain.info\n* 2 of 2 multi signature wallets, such that both the user and financial intermediary must sign a transaction\te.g. Greenaddress.it\n* 1 of 2 multi signature wallets, such that either the user or the financial intermediary must sign a transaction\t \n* 2 of 3 multi signature wallets, such that two of the user, a hash of the users password and the financial intermediary must sign a transaction e.g. Coinbase Vault\n* n of m multi signature wallets, such that\xe2\x80\xa6\t \n* Hierarchical deterministic wallets, such that a root private key can generate branches of junior private keys\xe2\x80\xa6\n* Hierarchical deterministic multisignature wallets, such that...\t \n* Traditional banking model e.g. Circle, Coinbase\n': 32, "Now this is interesting.
