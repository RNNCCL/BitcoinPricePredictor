Additionally, accounts are required to have two-factor authentication (2FA) enabled.\n\nOnline Storage:\n\nCustomer personal information (including address and phone number) and bank account information is stored in encrypted format, using multiple layers of encryption, and is never decrypted in any archive or other data format. Circle does not store customer credit card information at all, but rather stores a card reference in the form of a cryptographic hash that is useless by itself. Circle's live systems are protected according to the best practices currently available to software and systems engineering, and Circle's systems are periodically audited and tested by external security experts certified to provide such testing.\n\nInsurance:\n\nMoney in your Circle account is insured at no cost to you. We take every precaution to keep your money safe, but in the event that something unfortunate happens, we've got you covered. Our insurance policy is provided by Marsh and underwritten by leading underwriters who thoroughly review and audit our security procedures.\nAdditionally, we do have provisions for returning our customers\xe2\x80\x99 funds back to them in the case of insolvency.\n\nCompany:\n\nAs a company, Circle is regulated by the U.S. Department of Treasury\xe2\x80\x99s FinCEN and is registered as a Money Services Business. Circle\xe2\x80\x99s finances are publicly audited annually. Circle\xe2\x80\x99s online and offline funds are independently audited.\nAll Circle employees have passed stringent background checks, are required to use encrypted laptops among other IT protections, and follow the principles of least privilege.\n\nPlease feel free to reach out to us if you have any questions about our procedures.

There are several 'good' ways to store your coin, and Circle is not one of them. If you're not confortable taking total control of your own funds, then maybe you should leave them in Circle..but be aware that if Circle ever disappears, then so does your money. \n\nSome of the most secure ways to store btc involve the use of an offline-only device. This can be an android device, iphone, computer, old laptop, you get the idea. The point here, is that the computer is never connected to the internet. You can do all your key generation on this machine and be fairly confident that those keys can never be accessed. Paper wallets created on an offline machine are also a good solution, but make sure you know how to spend from them and how change addresses work.\n\nIf you're pretty comfortable on a PC, and know what makes a secure password, you might be well-served using a software like Electrum on an offline computer. Other options for mobile operating systems are Mycelium, breadwallet, among others.\n\nFor the amount that you have, over $2k USD, I would advise you to apply a tiered approach to your bitcoin storage. This allows you some convenience, while not sacrificing too much security. For example, maybe you store 2btc on your daily-use phone, using Mycelium with pin-protection on both the wallet and the phone. Different pins for each. Consider this your 'checking account'. Make sure to write down the seed phrase it gives you. Write it twice, store it in different places. Maybe stash one somewhere at work incase you loose your phone, you'll still have some money.\n\nThen, back at home, you can use an old laptop to create an cold electrum wallet. Boot Tails linux, or another liveOS, run electrum, and write down that seed phrase on 3 separate pieces of paper. Double check you wrote it correctly. Also copy a few of your public keys, you'll need these to send btc to the coldwallet. After you create the wallet, you can shut down the computer and the keys you generated will be erased. Take one piece of paper, put it in your safe deposit box. Take another, and hide it behind your favorite picture on the wall. Take the third, and give it to your mom, tell her what it is as best you can...in case something happens to you, she'll be able to have access to your treasure.\n\nTruthfully, you should execute all these steps using maybe .1 btc, just to test it and make sure you actually know how to restore from seed, spend from paper wallets, etc. \n\nFor an *even higher* level of security, you could consider purchasing a Trezor hardware wallet (about $100, maybe less), and integrate it into the steps above. It is compatible with Electrum, and soon Mycelium, as well as others. In addition, using Trezor, you could actually skip the whole offline computer portion; since the keys never leave the Trezor device, it is safe to initialize on a compromised machine.\n\nEdit: made some edits\n\nMajor points:   \n- Tiered storage   \n- Offline-only machine   \n- Do a run-through, know how to use your setup      \n- REDUNDANT BACKUPS, store them separately   \n- Test different software to figure out what you like best   \n- Hardware wallet is best wallet": 3}, ('Thinking of installing a BTM/ATM for bitcoin in Indiana...any retailers want to host?

With so many reports of hacks that we hear about on a daily basis, people have a completely reasonable right to be skeptical that the whole system could just collapse due to a flaw or attack at some point in the future.\n\nThe more companies demonstrate that blockchain technology is completely solid, then the better it is for the value in bitcoin.\n\nThink about it.  If we woke up tomorrow and found out that the bitcoin network had been hacked, all of the value would likely disappear overnight.   That has always been a real and legitimate fear.\n\nThe more major players show faith and trust in blockchain technology then, likewise, it demonstrates that it is reasonable to put faith and trust in the long term ability for the bitcoin blockchain to survive as a store of value.\n\nI welcome companies which want to use blockchain technology for fiat based coins.  That is a Pepsi challenge I will take any day of the week.  It shows that digital currencies are the future, that the technology is strong, and that people can easily convert between them.\n\nGiven a choice between a digital currency based on fiat and one based on bitcoin, it's an easy decision for me.  That said, I would likely use a fiat based digital currency at times, for the same reasons I want to use bitcoin.  To keep my online transactions secure.\n\nI suspect that any of these fiat based blockchains will also provide as 'features' things most bitcoin supporters do *not* want.\n\nFiat based digital currencies, even if they are using blockchain technology, will almost for sure restrict access to select and approved participants.  They will almost for sure disallow anonymity.  They may provide support for chargebacks.  They will probably support locking and freezing of funds by government entities.  They will restrict access by country as well.\n\nThese will probably be sand-boxes for big banks to move massive sums of money around the world and provide highly regulated and controlled access to consumers.\n\nSo, even though they both might use blockchain technology, I think you can see that bitcoins advantages will become quite clear.  Then, the only question will be about volatility and, hey, if you can't stomach bitcoins volatility, I completely get it.  Use fiat coin all you want.\n\nI think both systems will operate just fine side by side, there will even be on-ramps and off-ramps between the systems (like Ripple does today).\n\nI think anyone using blockchain technology is nothing but a net positive for bitcoin for these reasons and more.\n\n": 2, 'I am fairly convinced that Bitcoin is going to be an "underlying" technology more than a surface level technology.  \n\nIt allows value to be transferred from machine to machine, via software, simply, cheaply and efficiently.  \n\nSure, anyone can use it -- but it is much easier to have software do it -- And in most cases our incumbent payment methods are adequate enough that they are going to be difficult to displace.  \n\nSo in short - Bitcoin\'s growth is going to come from integration with new technologies -- and the decentralized consensus possible with the blockchain is the main draw to integrate with.

But this message is clearly not the last word. The words \xe2\x80\x9cprimitive version\xe2\x80\x9d are too vague, and must be made more precise. More technically, this paper proves that the set of incentive-feasible allocations with memory provides an upper bound for the set of incentive-feasible allocations with money. Can we find a simply described technology that generates a smaller upper bound? More ambitiously, can we find the smallest such upper bound? Despite this limitation of the analysis, I believe that this paper represents an advance over the usual justifications for the existence of money: \n\n>Money is a store of value, money is a medium of exchange andor money is a unit of account. These phrases are certainly useful descriptions of money\xe2\x80\x99s role in equilibrium. However, they are misleading when taken as descriptions of the technological function of money. After all, money does not allow society to transfer resources over time. Money does not reduce the cost of transferring resources from one person to another. There its no immediate technological reason why money should be a better numeraire than other goods. An important conclusion of this paper is that \xe2\x80\x9cMoney is memory\xe2\x80\x9d is a much more revealing and accurate description of money\xe2\x80\x99s effect on economic primitives (preferences, information, and technology) than these other, more common, descriptions.\n>In this paper, money and memory are studied in isolation from one another. In the real world, money and memory co-exist. Kocherlakota and Wallace [6] examine a particular setting in which society has access to both money and memory that is updated only infrequently.

When you see the signs of gold's downward motion, sell and buy whatever cryptocurrency looks set to be the market leader. \n\nKeep in mind, Bitcoin is not backed by gold, Ivugeo is. I don't own either but I am watching the progress of both. As recently as yesterday the idea was floating around that gold should be given no more than an industrial value. Today Ivugeo emerges as a \xe2\x80\x9dgold standard\xe2\x80\x9d. But that doesn't mean Ivugeo will beat Bitcoin.\n\nAnd now for some bad news - but remember, a mine field is only dangerous if you don't know the way through - It is expected that the supermarket shelves will be empty by noon on the 15th of September 2015. Please stay out of the way of the crowds racing to the stores on the 15th! Calmly begin to stock up on emergency supplies today. Stock up on plenty of WATER, fill the bathtub, fill every empty container you can find. Stock up on canned/tinned soups especially lentil soup and vegetable soup. Stock up on soap, brown sugar, salt, medicine, reading glasses, candles, matches, PET FOOD, (don't forget your best friends), your pets count on you to protect them. If you can afford to stock up on emergency supplies for a period of about three to four months you should be covered. \n\nStocking up on emergency supplies and taking steps to protect your assets does not mean you've become a tinfoil-hat conspiracy theorist. It means that you're being realistic.\n\nAbove all, please, be calm. If the change-over goes smoothly, you can trade your precious metals for altcoins. And a store of emergency supplies can only be a good thing. If uninformed people panic, and the Greek and Chinese scenarios play out, these simple precautions will be the smartest moves you've ever made.": 0, "How do you sell Groupon gift cards for bitcoin?

With the current market cap of only $4 billion, exchanges don't have enough liquidity to absorb massive trades. It will take a long time for price volatility to subside.\n\nThe *value* of bitcoin is known to fluctuate wildly at times, but the inflation rate is hard-coded into the software to decrease over time. Here's a [couple charts](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=130619.0) that visualize the rate of inflation over time. It's currently 10%, and in ten years it will have fallen to less than 1%. \n\n>Why would one want to spend bitcoins?\n\nSome people refuse to spend for another 10-20 years because they believe their holdings will be worth more as bitcoin becomes more scarce in the future. From the vibes I get from merchants, it does seem like most people who own bitcoin aren't spending it very often. Time will tell if that situation improves.\n\nMeanwhile, it's good to spend because it encourages merchant adoption and helps improve payment infrastructure. You can protect yourself from price volatility by simply repurchasing the same amount that you just spent. So if I spend some bitcoin on a $500 plane ticket, then I just repurchase $500 worth of bitcoin shortly after. Sometimes I'll purchase 10% more just to steadily increase my holdings.\n\n": 4, '> Why do I have to give them my identity?': 1, 'Thanks, forwarding $1 to /u/BinaryResult for all his help with this. /u/changetip private': 5, "Yes they do.

Since spending can be rather cumbersome, and since some of us believe it will be worth more later on, people tend to just hang onto their bitcoin. When they buy something with it, the repurchase the spent bitcoin as soon as they can. Every few weeks or months, they add a little more to their stash as their budget allows.\n\nHope that helps.
