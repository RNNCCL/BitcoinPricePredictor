Fund X amount that is used up through time.  Think of another type of coin that the donator can CHOOSE which foods it can buy or what % off they get for foods made of high fructose corn syrup vs foods made of apple.\n\nedit: I should add that it would be pretty simple to make a service where two phones can call at the same time and then go ear to mouthpiece 69 with each-other to verify both accounts.  To totally ignore the learning curve of "crypto currency" you would just tell the homeless (phones homeless) to call a 1800 number and you call it too - 69 the phones which will send test tones to determine which phones currently calling the service are next to eachother... now the homeless has an account and you can type in how much to send him, his phone says "recieved $20" and you just tell him to go buy food and at the checkout there is a number to text at the checkout line - the phone# IDs him to the service which loads his balance into the checkout isle for spending.\n\nDonor can set all kinds of contract rules before funding a coin\nYou can give an unknown amount (hide balance) that just reduces the cost of groceries until it is extinguished - so there isn\'t a one time fix but a long term residual benefit.  If one has enough simultaneous donors then he wouldn\'t need to furnish any payment but if he receives too much then some unspent coin can be returned to the donor\'s account when certain conditions are met.': 1, 'If Sean\'s Outpost put up little bios for homeless, people, we could donate to them individually :/ I\'ve considered this in the "wild" but, they probably wouldn\'t get many btctips (unless they became "viral" on the web via onlookers re-posting to web). then of course, some homeless people don\'t use electronics. keep brainstorming guys. good concept': 2, 'Step 1: move to the USA.

The QR code could either be displayed on their sign, or the homeless could be provided with a laminated QR code of their public address. The problem with this is third-party private key access/ownership because it is generated by someone other than the homeless individual. If an organized project to convert the homeless to Bitcoin becomes a large-scale effort, then how can one ensure the security of these private keys? If such an organization was established across the country/world it would require oversight or structure. Someone (person A) could print out a public QR of their own private address and then give it to however many homeless people they want \xe2\x80\x93\xc2\xa0all the Bitcoin that is sent to the homeless would find its way back to person A's wallet. Imagine what sadness would arise when the interested and hopeful homeless person accesses a computer only to find that all the coins were stolen. This would be bad in many ways.  \n  \nAnother issue is computer access. Maybe they could go to a public library which has accessible computers; they could make the trip as often as permitting (maybe once a week). Or they could be advised to hodl, for the price may increase and their hodling will pay off greater. Nevertheless, securing their wallets is most important. They should be the only ones in control of the private keys.  \n  \nA new platform may need to be created, such as software designed specifically for simplified offline key generation and wallet access/sweeping. The software could be handed out as a live-CD or a dedicated computer/device could be safely installed in common areas.  \n  \nIn the end, what would they do with the bitcoins? They most likely don't have a smartphone, so making purchases at physical locations wouldn't be convenient at all. Exchanging their coins for fiat would only be possible if done with cash in person. This could be achieved in an organized fashion with the help of participating members. It would run similar to LocalBitcoins, except the organization's members would periodically visit areas or specific homeless individuals to pick up their Bitcoins in exchange for cash.  \n  \nThere's a lot more to explore with this idea.

But first, if you agree that DPOS provides better security for lower cost, then what do you think about [my suggestion](http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/2gjkpv/is_this_the_reason_the_bitcoin_price_is_not/ckk8oz7) that you can still design the system for inflation?\n\nI [claim](http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/2gjkpv/is_this_the_reason_the_bitcoin_price_is_not/ckk2kqz?context=3) that there are three ways of distributing the excess network fees and inflated money supply. \n\nYou can give it back to the current stakeholders in proportion to their stake (which is equivalent to no inflation at all and can in fact be deflationary). You seem to have a strong disagreement with this philosophy.\n\nYou can give it ASIC manufacturers and power companies. This is what POW does.\n\nOr, you can give it to other specific entities/organizations. Rather than wasting resources on building more ASICs or burning more coal, we can use those resources to build infrastructure, do research, or maybe even promote adoption of cryptocurrency. Anything is better than wasting the resources on electricity and ASICs when we no longer need to do so to secure the blockchain.\n\nNow regarding the fairness of the IPO method of distributing initial stake. First, just like any other start-up business, people take risks with their money supporting a new innovative DAC. People still do not believe in BitShares X even though it is released and working (with some minor bugginess) and the peg is holding up okay (not fantastic but okay). How much of a risk was it for early investors to put real money (BTC) back in January and February on just an idea? Also the developers are sacrificing time and energy (and opportunity cost for not working somewhere else with higher pay) on the hope that this will make it big. It is no different than a tech start-up.\n\nIf you want to live in a world where innovators are not rewarded at all despite creating useful tools for society, you are going to kill (or at least seriously reduce the rate of) innovation. Should we burn Satoshi\'s stake as our strange way of saying thank you for creating such a brilliant new technology? And if you are worried about extreme wealth inequality, keep in mind the following: \n\n* Plenty of people had an opportunity to get in on the IPO. It was well publicized and ran for two months (at least the one for BitShares X did). If people chose not to take the risk at that point, that is their decision to make.\n\n* The price in July after release was actually less than what many people paid in the IPO! People who dismissed the idea during the IPO had another great opportunity to buy in. And they had the added advantage of getting a better sense of how the system works (meaning far less risk than the people investing during the IPO). \n\n* The stake will be distributed anyway. There is no point in holding the majority of a worthless currency. A currency only becomes more valuable as more people use it. For people to be able to use it, the stakeholders need to sell their stake to others. And they will do this. They will want to take advantage of the price increase and start cashing in to consume real goods/services. Inflating the money supply is not necessary for distributing the stake. But like I said, you can still do it with DPOS if you want, just do it in a productive way.\n\n\n': 1, 'But your doing it again... this is NOT an alt coin. The claims that bitshares makes about DPOS being better than POW may be true... FOR BITSHARES. But again, that is because bitshares (and im lumping a lot of different products here but it still holds) is not a "coin". The bitshares products are for-profit companies. If you look at it like that its obvious why they have such a problem with the wasteful practices of POW. The reason DPOS is (imo) NOT good for bitcoin is because global "money" should not be a for-profit company. And the method of distribution to a non-invested 3rd party (miners) is FAR more elegantly incentivised and fair for something that is supposed to just be "money" (again, imo anyway)': 0, '>  The "waste" electricity secure the network. It\'s a self regulated market where if it not profitable miner stop their machines.\n\nI understand how POW secures the blockchain. I am not arguing it does not. I am arguing that DPOS provides better security for lower cost, therefore it is rational to switch to that instead of continuing to use POW. Once you do that, you will realize the wealth redistribution is not necessary to secure the network. You can still do it of course if you really wanted to for some reason.\n\n> I think the POS doesn\'t work because all the coins are given at start then number grows; the ratio is still the same.\n\nThat is not a reason why POS wouldn\'t secure a blockchain. That is an economic policy that you do not like for whatever reason. A POS system does not need to implement such an economic policy. In fact, DPOS does not reward block producers with a reward proportional to their stake (unlike other POS systems you might be familiar with). The delegates don\'t need stake to produce blocks, they just need to get elected by the stakeholders and do their job, and they will be paid by the network for doing that job. \n\n': 1, "Tell me what's the distribution of bitshares then? \nAnd tell me how someone who get 50% of the bitshares at start will still have 50% 10 years after if he do nothing at all?

So here's your basic answer.\n\nEssentially what you are doing is making a $10000 bet that the price will rise from $500 to $510. You are correct in assuming that this is very likely to occur, and if it does you will receive a 1.02% return on your investment. However, whenever you make a bet, you have to consider the odds. If the price rises above $510, you gain 1.02%, but if the price never raises above $510, you lose 100%. Because of this huge risk/reward disparity, you need to be at least 99% sure that the price will rise above $510 in order to make this investment. Considering bitcoin's history, the vast majority of traders do not believe with 99% certainty that the price of bitcoin will rise 1.02%. This same idea of betting a large sum of money with a great likelihood of winning a small reward, and a small chance of losing it all, can be seen here if you are interested: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martingale_(betting_system)\n\nYou may look at those odds (1.02% increase and 100% decrease) and think that a 100% decrease is unreasonable, which any trader would. So what do you do? You set a point at which you will sell your trade. A point where you realize that the likelihood of bitcoin ever reaching the initial goal is far away from 99%. For example, if bitcoin hits $100, you would need to reevaluate your trading plan, and form a new probability that bitcoin will ever reach your point of $510. \n\nKeep in mind that in the market traders are constantly competing against each other to be the ones who sell high and buy low. If you are not in the very top end of professional traders who do this for a living, there is almost no chance that you will make a significant amount of money in the long term day trading.\n\nedit: I would like to clarify that many people fall for this same misconception in the Martingale betting system the first time they see it, so don't feel bad for not understanding it at first glance.

Coinbase just creates a new wallet which is tied to your account. I like the added convenience of their site and the ability to reset my password if I forget it. I have mine set up with mobile authentication so it texts a unique number to log in and if any login requests come from a new IP I also need to verify by email so I believe it to be adequately secure. The disadvantage is that you are trusting Coinbase with your wallet and after what happened to mtgox most would advise against that. I only deal with a couple hundred dollars in btc though.

It was possible that the media and authorities could have used Wikileaks support to squash Bitcoin but it was so early Bitcoin was pretty much derided as a joke currency by most. Very few people fully understood it and was simply not taken seriously like it is today, most people that knew about it still fully believed Bitcoin was a ponzi/pyramid scheme, and the people that truly did understand it were few and far between (we\'re still talking CPU mining days too). The penny for just how innovative/disruptive Bitcoin was hadn\'t actually dropped.\n\nIt was still being ignored by most but Satoshi wasn\'t wrong, it\'s just that it hadn\'t clicked for most, but when it did, media and authorities simply chose a much more appealing topic to smear Bitcoin with, something that resonated with most and would demonise Bitcoin the easiest, and that was the Silk Road. Wikileaks, though it had a stong anti-establishment drive to it, was not outright illegal, and still had grudging respect from journalists and people in general, but not Silk Road. Silk Road was about as criminal as it gets in the minds of media, authorities, and the public in general. Not more that 6 months after Satoshi had gone silent, Silk Road popped up, that\'s when the media exploded over Bitcoin, and being an avid Bitcoin follower back then, I can tell you it was a constant stream of Bitcoin condemnation (it was actually very depressing to read on a daily basis yet another Bitcoin hit piece literally for months on end), for all the good Silk Road brought to Bitcoin (such as awareness, early price liquidity, usage, and other innovations), it also cemented Bitcoin with it\'s black market reputation that it still struggles to shake loose of. Anything remotely positive about Bitcoin, or it\'s true potential was shouted down/countered by "drugs!", "tool for evil!", "terrs\'ts!", etc. For months you simply could not hear a mention of Bitcoin, without also hearing Silk Road in the same sentence.\n\nI personally wholeheartedly agreed with Satoshi\'s sentiment, and I think it\'s also why he stepped back at that stage (he\'d been involved in Bitcoin tirelessly for 4-ish years so it\'s understandable that when people start using your creation for potentially illegal applications, you try to distance yourself), though his warnings were a bit premature, he wanted Bitcoin to grow more before it had to lock horns with opposing interests, which it absolutely did when Silk Road appeared.
