It'll have one key that it uses to generate a whole infinite chain of more keys, in a repeatable (deterministic) way - so any other wallet can repeat the process to generate the same set of keys.\n\n>Is it more or less or equally safe to use a wallet that only requires a fraction of the blockchain to ruin, like multibit, or is it more advisable to use one that requires the full ledger like bitcoin core? Why is one better? \n\nStoring your own copy of the blockchain means you can verify the history entirely locally as your own independent confirmation. If you don't do that, then you need to query a remote server instead of looking up an answer in your own local copy. Theoretically that server could be malicious or deceptive or compromised, or your connection could be intercepted and interfered with to mislead you for some nefarious purpose. \n\nIt doesn't affect how secure your keys are, which is the important thing for your own personal security. So It's mostly a non-issue for your average user, but in the theoretical extreme where some bad actor tried to take over All The Nodes as a way to attack the network, having more independent nodes and more independent copies of the blockchain makes that even more impossible.\n\n>Is there inerrant risk in having a large amount of coins in any given wallet? \n\nThat depends on your setup. You can safely assume that if *one* key has been stolen from a particular device or storage medium, then *all* the keys have been stolen from that place. So you would need to have independent wallets stored in genuinely separate places to have a security advantage (so that even if one is hacked, you don't lose your whole stash). \n\nIdeally different types of device running different software, so that if a bug or hack becomes known for one, the others are unaffected. Even more ideally, if you need to secure a significant sum, a cold wallet that holds the key(s) to your long-term storage address(es) in a form that can't be accessed remotely and has never been connected (even indirectly) to the internet, and is then physically secured from ordinary theft.\n\n>Does a light wallet like multibit have the ability to hold your coins for 10+ years even though it's not looking at the entire blockchain history? \n\nSure. A wallet just needs to store your keys, which are numbers. If it can remember a number then it can store your keys (and thereby your ability to spend your coins) indefinitely.\n\n>How does it know of your transactions or balance if its not looking at a the entire blockchain, but rather a small piece of the blockchain?\n\nIt asks a remote server (one that *does* have a full copy of the blockchain) to tell it the answer.": 1, "The wallet IS the key.

An address is always able to receive coins (because that doesn't involve your participation - the network just passes around a transaction saying you received some coins, and then it's true), regardless of whether your wallet software is online or not, or if the keys are inscribed into tungsten and buried in the back yard, or even lost entirely.\n\nBut in order to *spend* coins, you need to use the private key for that address. Keys should be able to be exported/imported between wallets without too much trouble - they're really just very large numbers, nothing software-specific. Unless the backup *isn't* of the key directly, but is actually a seed value from which the key is generated by some method specific to your particular wallet software, but you would probably know if that were the case and could choose to export the key directly instead.\n\nIf you export the key from a wallet and import it somewhere else, unless it's been deleted from the first device you'll be able to spend your coins from either one - again, the key is just a secret number that you use to prove who you are. There's no limit on how many times you can copy that number, and any wallet can use it to spend your coins.\n\nHowever, when coins are spent that will often generate some change (if you receive 2 then want to spend 1, you have to spend the entire 2-coin input, so you send 1 to your intended recipient and 1 back to yourself). That change may well end up in a new address (as is good practice) which wouldn't then be spendable without the key to that address. A backup of your wallet may well include a collection of not-yet-used keys for just that purpose, but that pool of spare keys won't last forever, so to maintain continuous access to your coins from multiple devices you *either* need to keep syncing your keys between them occasionally *or* use a hierarchical deterministic wallet, where one master key is used to generate multiple address/key pairs - then you can backup/sync the master key and all subsequent addresses will be included.

This is one of those times where it would be great to have a web application that takes your HD seed words and only generates a list of safe addresses from it. Some of us brainstormed about it a week or so ago.\n\nConsider one of my ideas, for example: use a script that takes your HD seed word list and generates 10,000 deposit-only Bitcoin addresses (no private keys). Then run those addresses through a utility that generates QR codes from those deposit addresses. Finally, whenever someone visits your /bitcoin page, show them a random QR code from the many thousands stored in a directory. You don\'t ever need to place private keys anywhere near your web server and donors will enjoy some level of protection based thanks to the randomness in your display script. You could even do it with client side scripting -- send the browser a random address from your collection and have the browser generate the code, just like on BitAddress.org.\n\nFinally, and this will not be popular, you may wish to check out how the Wikimedia Foundation uses Coinbase to process donations.

This means that each translated version, just like the English version, will be available for free for anyone to use for any purpose. Translators can publish the book for profit without giving me a single cent. Independent publishers can do the same. I am not making royalties from any of the translations. For the English books I make a small royalty from every book sold, but the book is also free to download and legally available for free from many sources, including on github and as PDF, EPUB, MOBI torrents.\n\nIf you think that I am making a lot of money on the book, you don't know much about publishing. Amazon makes money on the book. If it continues to sell well, I might make minimum wage on the hours I worked on it, in a few years.\n\nTranslators who work on this can add credit to themselves in the book. Since it is open source and free-culture licensed, they could even add an entire chapter about themselves and then print and sell it for profit. No one needs to ask my permission or pay me or O'Reilly anything to do this. \n\nThe book can also be used for mashups, for building educational materials or any kind of derivative content. You could make a Star Trek themed musical based on it if you like. Again, I don't get paid for anything.
