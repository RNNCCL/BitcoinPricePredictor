": -1, 'To the best of my knowledge, the only software change that could be considered a hard fork was the Bitcoin Core 0.8.0 release.  One of the libraries Bitcoin Core used prior to 0.8 placed a limit on the number of outputs in a block; none of the developers realized the limit existed and the limit actually varied by platform.  Bitcoin Core 0.8 included an upgrade that no longer used that library for that purpose, lifting the unrealized limit.  A bit after the release of 0.8, a miner coincidentally created a block that was over the old limit and the network forked.\n\nThe major mining pools at the time agreed to downgrade to the older version of Bitcoin Core, restoring the previous rules[1].  A new version of Bitcoin Core 0.8 was released that respected the old rules as best the developers could determine with a schedule for an upgrade of the network to remove the limitation of the old nodes.  Instructions for patching old nodes was also provided.\n\n[1] It\'s hard to call the limitation that caused this a "consensus rule" because different platform enforced a different limitation, meaning there was no consensus and a chainfork could\'ve happened even if Bitcoin Core 0.8 had never happened.\n\n[BIP50](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0050.mediawiki) provides the retrospective on this.  Some people call this event a hard fork because the actual effect on the chain was similar to what you\'d expect in a hard fork.  Other people don\'t call it a hard fork because the inconsistent enforcement of the rule that triggered the chain split meant it wasn\'t a consensus rule.': 3, 'Good info on this topic here: https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/2s2utx/the_hard_fork_missile_crisis/cnlty0u': 1, 'Not since it entered the public.

What?\n\nThe point is that "normal sellers" may not want to associate themselves with some of the stuff that\'s on the darknet markets. They may actively *want* to put their "real" names and reputations on whatever they sell... and they may *not* want those names and reputations associated with drugs/guns/whatever.\n\nIf sellers believe that OpenBazaar is *or is perceived to be* primarily for "illicit" use, they may choose not to put their stores on OpenBazaar, because they don\'t want to be seen as black marketeers. And that is a completely rational concern on their part, because that\'s how some customers and others will think.\n\nIf the "normal sellers" don\'t have anything for sale, then the "normal buyers" will not show up either. And buyers will also have a somewhat weaker version of the same reputational concerns that sellers will have.\n\nAnybody who\'s "scared off" will have been "scared off" by a genuine risk, and that risk is *not* mitigated by marking thing as NSFW or whatever (which is itself a dangerous thing if you *are* an illicit seller). This isn\'t some silly worry about being exposed to naughty thoughts. It\'s a real concern about reputation.\n\nThere\'s a similar risk for OpenBazaar itself if it\'s perceived as a "dark market". When the cops and the politicians come knocking, it\'s a *lot* easier to fend them off if you can credibly claim to be a general-purpose platform that\'s "regrettably sometimes abused" than if you are obviously used almost exclusively for "dark" stuff. It also helps to have non-dark friends, in the form of all the buyers and sellers of "legitimate" goods who would be hurt if you were shut down.\n\nThat sort of political positioning is *hugely* important. It can prevent crackdowns. Even if the crackdowns do come, it may delay them for long enough that you can get more entrenched and be harder to shut down.\n\nThe concern is real and sane, and I say all this as a very pro-anonymity person, who is worried that OpenBazaar may screw up and back itself into a corner where it can\'t add anonymity later.\n\n> People are responsible for their own decisions and choices.\n\nYou wanna talk about sophistry...\n': 2, 'We certainly welcome help on figuring out how reputation or other systems could prevent the type of trolling that would turn off newcomers to the project.': 1, 'So does OB.

But since Blockstream's stated business model depends on Layer 2 solutions, I think the existence of a potential conflict is crystal clear. \n\nAre you familiar with group selection in evolutionary theory? It's kind of like that. You can have co-existing and opposing drives within an organism. For example, individual bacteria evolve to become more virulent. A more virulent bacterial cell will outcompete the other cells infecting an organism. At the same time, if the population of bacteria as a whole becomes too virulent it will kill the host, killing the goose that laid the golden egg so to speak. So there are pressures to prevent cells from evolving too virulently, because it puts the whole population in jeopardy. (It's actually been a controversial theory at times because Richard Dawkins has strongly opposed it, but there's a lot of evidence for this nevertheless.)\n\nIn the same way, Blockstream wants Bitcoin to succeed, but because their business model depends on Layer 2 solutions, they stand to benefit if Bitcoin develops in a way that emphasizes layer 2. It's simply a fact that there is a *potential* conflict there. Maybe you're right-- maybe in our reality there happens to not be a conflict, if it happens to be the case Bitcoin absolutely should not scale by increasing blocksize limit at this time. But it is simply a fact that a potential conflict exists where those two approaches diverge. If increasing the blocksize limit is in Bitcoin's best interest at some point in time (maybe now is not the time, there are many opinions on this), and they still oppose it, that is evidence of them acting on their conflict of interest. \n\nNow in my opinion their logic does not add up, their tactics have been tellingly underhanded, and I believe their behavior in this regard is explained by this apparent potential conflict of interest.\n\nBut my own opinion aside, it is simply a fact that a potential conflict exists given their business model.

If at any point their disagreements come at odds with each other (and i really can\'t imagine how this would come about exactly), the fedora Dev will simply not pull that code into the project, and red hat can still use it for its customers.

To my knowledge, no situation has arisen where all the devs who had commit rights were picked up by the same company. This is of course the case with the current BS employees who are also devs. In a project where there are no unburdened devs, nobody can stop changes that go against where the project was sup posed to go.

In fact, this was the original motivation for Wuille and others to explore the Segregated Witness concept.\n\n> Transaction malleability is caused by a cryptographic trick to change a signature, without changing what that signature stands for. This can be done, moreover, without the private key used to create the original signature. In Bitcoin's case, this means that anyone can pick any transaction from the peer-to-peer network, and alter the signature into an equally valid signature. This new signature still reflects the exact same data it originally signed, and it can still be verified using the same public key. It doesn't change what a transaction does at all. But because it looks different, it does completely change the transaction ID.\n\n> Transaction malleability causes two main problems. First, it messes up the accounting of Bitcoin software that uses transaction IDs to verify whether transactions are confirmed. **But perhaps more importantly, transaction malleability severely limits the potential of all sorts of advanced Bitcoin tricks that build on unconfirmed transactions (using their IDs), such as payments channels and the Lightning Network.**\n\nSo I'll re-iterate what I said 10 days ago :\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/4906st/this_is_what_a_healthy_fee_market_looks_like_when/d0oc5jc\n\n> Segwit is going to reduce congestion, and the jury is still out on whether that will suffice. If a standard fee transaction starts pushing up to about 25c, I think you'll start to see a recognition that the block-size increase is suitable.

Do larger blocks compromise that decentralization? Sure. To verify a block a node needs to check the signature of every transaction in the block. Even a spam transaction requires this computation and thus larger blocks take more computing power to verify. The current amount is not negligible and future amounts might further decrease the number of verifying nodes.\n\nIf there are fewer verifying nodes then Bitcoin is closer to being in the hands of a few entities rather than what we want, for it to be ubiquitous. That's what all this is about.\n\nSince space on a block is not an unlimited resource, it requires computing time and storage, it doesn't make sense that an entity would be able to use that resource without taking on the cost. This is why those of us who know that the full blocks we have observed are the result of spam and not of transactions that would be willing to pay a tiny fee are not worried.\n\nIn my opinion, the immediate solution to our scaling issues is to put a price on spam, to implement optimizations like SegWit, to implement layers on top of the blockchain layer that reduce the incentive to record transactions on the blockchain (like lightning network) and finally to grow block size limit at a pace at which consensus can keep up with and which allows Bitcoin verification to remain ubiquitous.": 1, 'What does that have anything to do with what I said?\n\nI never mentioned the word miner or the word fee.': 1, 'can you reformulate his point with what you consider "mature and great" communication skill so I can improve myself ?': 6, "Because it's likely that many mining operations will be un profitable when the halving occurs and switch off.

I narrow the scope to what is pretty explicit about Bitcoin.  I don't know what is meant by correctly understanding the opportunity cost because it's flat out impossible to do so.  The scenarios I preface with 'for all we know' consider both extremes of the block size to show this.  If Africa's best kept secret is that it has the best internet in the world, it's entirely irrelevant to what I'm saying.  For all I know, it does, and yet reducing the block size is still some impetus to get world wide adoption regardless of transaction fees.  For all I know, everyone sells their kidney to pay to own one Bitcoin tomorrow.  \n\nWithin the context of Bitcoin client development, it's all irrelevant.  Stop setting the price in terms of adoption and exchange.  The value of 1 BTC, for any 1 BTC is >= 1/21,000,000th of the Bitcoin economy for any time t, yesterday to the end of the earth.  That is the only conversion rate that matters.  Developing to that requirement makes decisions about parameters actually possible.  If the price of 1 BTC becomes 1 cent tomorrow and that causes you to deem it a failure, then that's unfortunate.  That would sound to me like you were in it for the dollar and not the Bitcoin in the first place. If we believe in the market, then we believe the price of something ULTIMATELY follows the value of something, and not the other way around.\n\nIf you don't think that's valuable, then check how any other currency fares against itself over time. https://www.measuringworth.com/uscompare/result.php?year_source=1980&amount=1&year_result=2016\n\nThe USD has widespread adoption.

We don\'t have all the time in the world. \n\nThis isn\'t trolling. It\'s not FUD.  And it\'s not manipulation or irrationality.  It\'s knowing products and markets rather than just hyper focusing on code.  The industry is moving forward without us.  I just can\'t figure out how you can not be aware of that. \n\nThis is why programmers don\'t make product development decisions.
