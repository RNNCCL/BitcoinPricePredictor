I am no expert on crypto currencies and don\'t know a lot about darkcoin, but here is what I think:\n\nA key to the security is the moasternode_vin. If I am not mistaken, the vin is the hash corresponding to the output of the coin a node has to hold to become a masternode. As I see it, someone could send the 1000 required coin to himself and generate a new hash every time. That way, an attacker could get a number of nodes, that are reasonably close to each other (in regards of "hash distance"). The attacker could now wait for the hash of the current block hash (called n2 in the paper) to be near his cluster and he will likely have a majority for the voting process. This would make the system vulnerable to sybil attacks.\n': 7, "Just finished the paper, and among a few other issues I found which I won't bother to report on, the most glaring is how susceptible this is to DoS, which indeed is often likely going to occur even unintentionally. This system requires everyone making a transaction to connect to one of 10 nodes randomly selected from a large pool. If any of the 10 nodes fails to authorise a transaction, whether by malice or because it has gone offline, the transaction must wait for confirmation in the blockchain. That means that to DoS the network, an attacker need only DoS the weakest masternode selected, which in turn implies that _every masternode must be capable of withstanding a DoS attack by an extremely capable attacker_.

Pataki, the Internet is exclusively within the regulatory domain of the federal government. 18 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1960 was written in 1992, before the commercial Internet existed.  Relatedly, It is often impossible to tell or pinpoint where a mobile payment has geographically taken place, leading to a commerce clause paradox;\n\n\n>* State money transmission laws, and especially California\xe2\x80\x99s, place far too much unfettered authority in the hands of unelected bureaucrats, who can reject an application \xe2\x80\x9cfor any other reason\xe2\x80\x9d according to California\xe2\x80\x99s money transmission statute.  See City of Lakewood v. Plain Dealer Publishing.\n\n>*    Rejection of a money transmission license application in one state starts a domino effect where other states are more likely to reject an applicant who has already been rejected elsewhere, which causes an unreasonable burden on interstate commerce;\n\n>*    At least one state law, California\xe2\x80\x99s, requires an applicant to apply in writing and pay a non-refundable $5,000 fee before actually knowing the full tangible net worth requirements to apply, which vary on a case-by-case basis, violating the Due Process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment;\n\n>*    Some states (again, California) consider their money transmission laws \xe2\x80\x9cbetter\xe2\x80\x9d than those of other states, and so even having a license in Alabama may not permit a California company to do business as a money transmitter in Alabama, again leading to a commerce clause paradox;\n\n>*    State regulators admit that they are biased against certain types of applicants (small businesses or businesses who have not applied nationwide), in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.': 24, 'This realization is kinda what pushed me to anarcho-capitalism from a more libertarian position.': 7}, ('The lower the price the better!', 0): {'"This is actually good news."': 1, 'The $400 floor has been broken all afternoon.': 1, '[deleted]': 1}, ('Butterfly Labs (BFL) Raided by US Marshals Today', 555): {'Am I reading this headline right?

Which is a premise I would reject outright, as the number of coins being spent and sold out is much more greatly affected by sites like Silk Road and Overstock than the state of the mining community.\n\nRegardless, that\'s not really how human nature works. If the rest of you want to arbitrarily run the network with a 333mh/s miner, I\'ll buy a few hundred cheap jalapeno miners off eBay and rule the network. The idea that someone should choose to not act to their own advantage is insane. That\'s more or less the sort of thing that Bitcoin sets out to resolve, people acting in their own interest helps the network and makes it less susceptible to a 51% attack(among other things) rather than hurt it. \n\nA common term thrown out to describe the current state of the mining community is "arms race" which is preposterous. Right now, it looks like the Bitcoin network is disobeying Moore\'s Law, but that isn\'t the case. Bitcoin was initially throttled by a lack of optimization in the hardware used to mine, then other hardware was discovered to be more efficient, and finally existing technology began being used to build specialized hardware. As of yet, there hasn\'t really been any true innovation to increase the network power, the mining hardware is just catching up to the current technology, and as we get closer to "now" with the speed and tech, the network hashing power will start coming into line with Moore\'s Law. \n\nPersonally, I would say that the biggest cause right now for the drop is increased adoption at the retail level(Overstock and soon to be Braintree for example) without much adoption at the wholesale level. This is forcing retailers to cash out a large chunk of the Bitcoins they earn, causing the price to drop. Once more wholesale suppliers accept Bitcoin as a payment method, retailers will be able to keep more of the Bitcoins they earn to pay for things on the back end of their business, keeping Bitcoins within their own little economy, increasing the scarcity for anyone who shows up late to the party and thus driving the price back up. \n\nIf you want to see the price skyrocket, get more wholesalers to accept Bitcoin and offer discounts to retailers paying in Bitcoin.': 1, 'You must be rich knowing the future and all...
