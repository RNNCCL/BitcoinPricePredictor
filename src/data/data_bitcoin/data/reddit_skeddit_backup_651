This is a bearish opinion held by many traditional investors, but not one you would expect from the man responsible for turning the virtual currency into a commodity worth billions.\n\n> Yet, that is the view of Gavin Andresen, chief scientist at the Bitcoin Foundation, the closest thing to a central bank for the nascent cryptocurrency. He is considered the leading custodian of the bitcoin code, the rules and software used to run the cryptocurrency. But far from being a cheerleader, Mr Andresen, is warning ordinary people to avoid bitcoin \xe2\x80\x94 for now. \n\n> \xe2\x80\x9cIt actually is dangerous and people should be aware it\xe2\x80\x99s like the early internet,\xe2\x80\x9d he tells the Financial Times. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you lived through time, you remember lots of press articles came out saying don\xe2\x80\x99t give internet companies your credit card details. But the internet grew past that. Bitcoin will be the same way.

At its peak, bitcoin was traded for $1,240 on the Mt Gox exchange, the Japanese group that filed for bankruptcy last year after losing about $450m worth of bitcoin in a cyber attack. According to Coindesk, the bitcoin news site, the price is now about $283.\n\n> \xe2\x80\x9cBitstamp is handling the incident well,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr Andresen says, by being transparent and explaining to customers what happened. \xe2\x80\x9cI hope they take the time to publish a complete postmortem on details of the attack, so other exchanges can learn from their mistakes.\n\n> \xe2\x80\x9cI hope Mt Gox does the same because we still don\xe2\x80\x99t know what happened.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n> Mr Andresen is considered the prot\xc3\xa9g\xc3\xa9 to \xe2\x80\x9cSatoshi Nakamoto\xe2\x80\x9d, the name adopted by the supposed inventor of bitcoin. After collaborating on the project over email, Mr Andresen was given Mr Nakamoto\xe2\x80\x99s blessing to become the \xe2\x80\x9ccore maintainer\xe2\x80\x9d of the bitcoin source code, working full time on the project.\n\n> While Nakamoto appears to have vanished, Mr Andresen wields huge influence on the development of the currency. He helped to found the Bitcoin Foundation in 2012 and groups from financial regulators to the CIA seek his advice. \n\n> His knowledge of bitcoin has led to suggestions he may actually be Nakamoto. \xe2\x80\x9cI am not Satoshi,\xe2\x80\x9d he laughs. \xe2\x80\x9cAsk any geek. Point them to code written by Satoshi and point them to code written by me. You can tell, they\xe2\x80\x99re not the same guy.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n> His theory is that the inventor is \xe2\x80\x9ca young academic type, somewhere in the world. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think Japan. Perhaps the British Isles actually because in Satoshi\xe2\x80\x99s communications he [used British rather than American spellings]. I think there\xe2\x80\x99s an academic thinking about other stuff, sitting on a big pile of bitcoin.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n> The one person who Mr Andresen says is definitely not Satoshi Nakamoto is Dorian S. Nakamoto, the Japanese-American engineer that Newsweek named as bitcoin\xe2\x80\x99s inventor last year. Mr Nakamoto, who lives in California, denies any role in bitcoin.\n\n> \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s not the Satoshi I talked to,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr Andresen. \xe2\x80\x9cI feel sorry for Dorian that so much personal attention got focused on this person. That shows why the actual Satoshi has worked so hard to stay anonymous.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n> His influence at the Bitcoin Foundation could soon increase, after it emerged Jim Harper, its global policy counsel, was dismissed earlier this month. The move is seen as a shift in focus for the non-profit group away from policy and regulation and back towards developing bitcoin\xe2\x80\x99s core technology.\n\n> \xe2\x80\x9cIt is always hard when an organisation pivots and priorities change,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cEffective organisations have a clear mission and focus and there is plenty of work to be done on the technical front to keep the foundation busy.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n> Though Mr Andresen concedes bitcoin remains in the early days of its development, he is confident it will mature, noting that more than $300m of venture money had been invested in bitcoin start-ups in 2014.\n\n> Mr Andresen is also at the forefront of efforts to ready the virtual currency for wider use. As it is currently designed, the bitcoin network can process just seven transactions a second. By comparison, Visa is capable of handling close to 50,000 transaction a second at peak times.\n\n> Mr Andresen\xe2\x80\x99s proposed solution is to increase the size of bitcoin blocks, the files that hold the data that underpins the currency. Their size limits the speed at which the bitcoin network can process transactions. Larger blocks can contain more transactions and, therefore, increase the capacity of the network.\n\n> But there are concerns that increasing the block size will put a strain on the network. Bigger blocks packed with more transactions requires transmitting and storing more data. This may also make it difficult for hobbyists to store a full copy of the \xe2\x80\x9cblockchain\xe2\x80\x9d, centralising power in the hands of corporations that can afford expensive servers in big data centres.\n\n> The issue is being debated by bitcoin developers. But Mr Andresen says that \xe2\x80\x9cwe\xe2\x80\x99re really close to consensus\xe2\x80\x9d to approve his proposal, a move that \xe2\x80\x9cin 20 years, would allow us to have enough capacity to handle every single electronic transaction in the world\xe2\x80\x9d.\n\n> While Mr Andresen tries to prepare bitcoin for mass usage, he advises caution to investors. He holds thousands of bitcoins, enough to retire comfortably. But he has been cashing them in slowly, investing in stock market funds instead.\n\n> \xe2\x80\x9cBitcoin is wild and crazy investment that I\xe2\x80\x99m diversifying out of all the time,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cIf bitcoin is wildly successful, I\xe2\x80\x99m still holding on to a good chunk of bitcoin. It could be worth tens of millions of dollars, but it could be worth zero. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make sense to hold more than that amount. I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a desire to be a multi-billionaire.

The deficit has been cut in half since 2008 and continued economic growth (estimated by most to be 3%+) will mean further reductions. Furthermore, if the US were in such imminent danger of default, then the cost of borrowing for the US government would be high and CDS\'s on US debt would be higher still. But both of those things are at historic lows, and have been, for a very long time. The "Operation Twist" scheme by the Treasury and Fed further helped lower US borrowing costs over the long run, to the point that the US is borrowing at rates lower than even long-term inflation. Just by sitting on its ass, in other words, US debt payments will shrink over time.\n\nRegarding debt levels in the US, that\'s also not at a crisis point or arguably even close to it. Japan\'s debt is over 200% of GDP, but there are not runs on the bank and people demanding revolution there. The debt in the US has also been higher in the past than it is today - particularly after WWII - and it recovered quite fine, fine enough to enjoy a tremendous 30 year economic expansion. From a standpoint of pure economics, there is very little to worry about in the US right now. Borrowing costs are at historic lows - even on the 30 year treasury bills - and the past few years of economic growth show few signs of abating. The only thing that could really cause problems for the US bottom line would be a new, unfunded Iraq-scale war, or a gigantic tax break.\n\nIf you want to talk bitcoin go ahead, but don\'t resort to ignorant fear-mongering.

Excluding external factors, a country and it's economy exist in perpetuity. Which means it's a perpetual 25 year old that can sustain a debt indefinitely.

When OPEC announced it wasn't going to curtail production, the price went through the floor.\n\nOn the whole, though, the oil collapse has been fantastic from a US foreign policy perspective. Low oil fucks Iran (whose cost of production is higher than the Saudis), ISIS (who has been sneaking oil into Turkey and from there onto the open market), and Russia.

For Blythe, the US should borrow as much as it can at the crazy low rates, then invest that money in the stock market, or well-rated corporate bonds, or capital investment in infrastructure etc. The difference between its return and its interest payments could then be used to shore up social security and other welfare programs, or put into a US sovereign wealth fund that could guarantee minimum payments to some or all taxpayers. \n\nThat idea is politically toxic and will never happen because of Republican grandstanding, but it just goes to show how very, very low US borrowing costs really are.": 3, 'The article doesn\'t strip out debt, rather it accounts for it.  He\'s correcting for the effectiveness of our debt utilization.  When something like that is not done, as it\'s not done for government GDP numbers, injecting high amounts of badly utilized debt can obviously make things look much better than they are.  Intuitively you must realize if we\'ve crammed a ton of new money into the system and don\'t somehow account for it then all our economic numbers will be wrong, and that\'s exactly the point the article is making.\n\nThese concepts are not that difficult and economists do talk about them (but not any mainstream ones that want to keep their jobs).  Again I recommend googling "marginal productivity of debt" as that\'s the term economists use for the sort of "correction" the article is trying to account for.  The marginal productivity of debt in the US has been falling for a long time.  We add more and more debt and get less and less of a GDP boost from it as time goes on.  Eventually it ends badly.\n\nAs for December jobs, they were up as you point out while wages were down (meaning the quality of jobs continue to decline).  Economically it doesn\'t say much to me...  we\'re still a long way away from the number of jobs required just to get us back to pre-2008 levels and I don\'t see any change in the big picture.  We\'re been bumping along in a very weak "recovery" (the weakest on record) and now we\'re overdue for a correction and the next one is likely to be very ugly.

The record-low borrowing costs are due to a combination of strong US growth and weaknesses elsewhere.\n\nYour long econ post:\n\nI would say there\'s a difference between "recovering" and "fixed." For example, comparing median household income over time says more about the runup to the 2008 bubble than it does about subsequent economic growth. If real estate values from 2001-2007 were part of an unsustainable bubble - as most people think - then it should be no surprise (and quoth bitcoin, "actually a good thing") that we haven\'t gotten back to those levels.\n\nUnemployment statistics: I have heard this argument before. I would say that the metric you use doesn\'t matter, as long as you use the same metric over time. If we exclude long-term unemployed, then we should exclude them across time and in all measurements. Labor force participation is a better measure than the official unemployment stats as far as reflecting reality, but one must also control for demographic shifts. Our country is getting older as the baby boomers retire, so it is certain that at least some dropoff will be due to demographics. Maybe not all, but at least some.\n\nThe median income problem has been a problem since the late 1970s. While part of it is the slower-than-expected recovery (which is now picking up steam, I\'d add), a lot of it is also directly due to pro-trade government policy which biases the highly educated over the uneducated, blue collar worker. It also helps explain changes in the distribution of wealth.\n\nMy point is, economic data can be cherry picked to create almost any argument you want to make. Just as you can look at that data and see evidence that the recovery is fake, I can provide reasoning as to why the data reads the way it does.

Banks and payment institutions still have the option of charging a credit-transfer fee of their choice for euro transfers if it is charged uniformly to all EEA participants, banks or payment institutions, domestic or foreign. This is relevant for countries which do not use the euro; domestic transfers in euro by consumers are uncommon, and inflated fees might be charged. Sweden and Denmark have legislated that euro transfers shall be charged the same as transfers in their own currency; which has the effect of giving free euro ATM withdrawals, but charges for ATM withdrawals in other currencies used in the EU.\n\n> In Regulation (EC) 924/2009, the European Parliament mandated that charges in respect of cross-border payments in euro (of up to EUR 50,000) to other Member States shall be the same as the charges for corresponding national payments. However, the EU Regulation does not apply to all SEPA countries; the most significant difference is the inclusion of Switzerland in SEPA but not the EU. The rule of the same price applies, even if the transaction is sent as an international transaction instead of a SEPA transaction (common before 2008, or if any involved bank does not support SEPA transactions). The regulation 924/2009 does not regulate charges for currency conversion so charges for non-euro transactions can still be applied (if not banned by national law).\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_Euro_Payments_Area\n\n---\n\n> Sweden does not currently use the euro as its currency and has no plans to replace the krona in the near future. Sweden is obliged under its 1994 Treaty of Accession to join the eurozone once it meets the necessary conditions set out in the Treaty of Maastricht. Sweden maintains that joining the ERM II (a requirement for euro adoption) is voluntary, and has chosen to remain outside pending public approval by a referendum, thereby intentionally avoiding the fulfilment of the adoption requirements.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden_and_the_euro': 1, 'The Sparkassen are independent, but share some things (e.g. logo, and some of their IT systems). 1822 is a big one, meaning they might do more things independently.': 1, 'I don\'t know what you mean by "challenged".

If there is fraud involved you might have other means of reversing the transfer (police, courts) but your bank won\'t do it for you.\n\nIt is however important to note that there are SEPA debit transactions, which are altogether a different animal. In a SEPA transfer person A sends money to person B (transfer intiated by person A). In a SEPA debit transaction person B (most likely an institution or a store) debits the account of person A with a certain amount (transfer initiated by person B).

You\'re fooling yourselves if you don\'t think there\'s going to be a fee spike at some point.\n\n\n>Its utility as the lowest transaction-cost currency is actually far more important than the likelihood of short-term value gains.\n\nSorry, but you can\'t win the day with "lowest cost!". No one gives a shit if your system costs less if it\'s less secure, slower, is harder to understand, and harder to use. In addition, this cost system is usually eaten by the merchant and then passed onto the consumer via sold goods. So the consumer doesn\'t have to worry about a transfer fee in addition to taxes and the like--it\'s already been taken into account.\n\n> If every transaction in the world is about 3% more efficient, that means rapid wealth gains for the entire world. Or at least those using bitcoin.\n\nWhich is why your currency has yet to raise the vast majority of you out of the proverbial gutter. Nor do you even have a right to talk about efficiency--bitcoin is the least efficient system there is. It fucking has to be due to its nature; it\'s a decentralized system. While that makes it harder to attack and harder to control, it also means it\'s also a great deal less efficient than a larger bank. \n\n>The bitcoin using world will rapidly begin gaining wealth over the fiat-users in time.\n\nAlright, provide evidence to show why this is the case. I want an professional economical source--any single one, that endorses bitcoin as gaining more \'wealth\' over fiat-based economies. Healthy ones too, not one from a nation in economical trouble. \n\n> We\'re not quite there because the bitcoin-purchase loop hasn\'t been closed, not quite enough people being paid in bitcoin and buying in bitcoin totally.\n\nBecause no one wants it. Even the companies that accept bitcoin don\'t actually accept it; they\'ve using middlemen who transform it into fiat first. In other words, in order for you to get your goods, you have to pay fiat for bitcoins, give the bitcoins to a middleman, who then exchanges them for fiat, to pay the company, who then gives you the product.\n\nEfficiency? I don\'t think so.\n\nAnd not to mention no one sane wants to be paid in bitcoin; because its value immediately changes by several dollars worth in a matter of hours. It isn\'t backed up by any sort of nation. It is not user-friendly. It has a set value that means if a country does start using bitcoins and those bitcoins are stolen, said country has effectively lost its entire wealth to someone else.

But really, if it\'s not one thing, it\'s another. \n\n> The price will be having known about bitcoin when it was still cheap and having chosen not to buy in, and not to doing enough research to check your biases :P\n\nYou mean as the price is plummeting? It\'s amazing how desperate you people are. Even after a month or so of constant pumping, of getting people ready for Black Friday--it was a complete and utter disaster. And after the holiday season, bitcoin is even worse shape. You\'ve reached the point now where no matter how far you pump, it takes more money and more energy just to bring it up to previous levels. I wonder, how long can you people pump it up to 300 again, before it tanks? A month? Two?\n\n>But whatever, all we need do is wait.\n\nNah. I can actually go out and have a life and forget that this exists, then come back 2-4 weeks later because I have absolutely nothing riding on this.

I say "todays value" because the only way I could see anywhere near that much value is if bitcoin were to become a global reserver currency and replace the dollar, and in that case the value of the dollar would drop substantially as bitcoin made it\'s way up so while it\'s possible that bitcoin could = 21 Trillion USD some day, on that day the question will be what is a USD worth?\n\n2. We can\'t really use the 21M bitcoin number to calculate bitcoins value.  Even once they are all mined, a very large though admittedly unknown number of those coins are lost forever and don\'t really count anymore.  For example lets say all the coins are mined and 15% of them are burned/lost/gone forever.  That would mean $1M per bitcoin would only add up to $17.8T USD.\n\n\nI would call it wildly sucessfull if bitcoin is able to match Paypal in usage.  I think it would be a reasonable calculate the potential value of bitcoin in this senario based on the value of all paypal accounts combined.  Sadly I don\'t have the information available so I\'ll take a guess.  Paypal processes about $570M a day so lets say 20% of that is from funded paypal accounts (as opposed to credit cards).  That leaves us with $114M per day, and lets say there is at least ten times that much money actually sitting in paypal accounts on any given day (though I expect it\'s probably more).  So we have a $2.2 Billion ballance at any given moment.  That\'s smaller than the current bitcoin "market cap", adjusted for last coins todays market cap is probably a reasonable value for bitcoin based solely on it\'s value as an online payment tool.\n\nBitcoin of course is not just an online payment tool though.  A very large portion of coins will probably always be held by traders and long term investors and of course bitcoin has many other potential markets asside from what paypal does.  So I do believe bitcoin still has exponential growth potential, but to expect a bitcoin to be worth $1M in todays USD is a bit crazy.': 2, 'Because of chumps like who you were convinced it would drastically rise in price, so you bought in hoping to make a quick buck. Same thing with Tulip Mania; the price skyrocketed, people were duped, and once they lost out, the prices of tulips dropped back to its normal value. The same is probably happening with bitcoin.\n\nThe only reason bitcoin survives to this day is because there are lots of reasons why people joined into bitcoin, from criminal reasons to anti-government reasons. But its main driving force has always been the hopes of obtaining more fiat. And now everyone left holding bitcoins after the money was made (or rather, redistributed) is left throwing more cash at the machine to make it work.\n\nBut it can\'t sustain itself. Whether you can keep it going for the next 2 years or the next 20 years is unimportant; bitcoin will probably not survive because it requires a fresh source of users, who will not see any reasons to switch over in mass.

Instead, intermediate transactions, often many of them, are created as 'throwaways' to mix or otherwise obscure the source of funds.\n\nI would argue that large volumes of dust and scratch throwaway  transactions to confuse the source of funds is largely responsible for the rise in transaction volume.\n\nIn fact, I bet only a very tiny percentage of transactions actually represent a single person moving nontrivial value from person A to B.

Does it mean there is a minimum like 0.5 btc worth of Storj or 10 btc worth of Storj? \n\nBased on my discussions this will most likely be covered by 1-2 transactions, by 1-2 parties. We have enough interest to meet this goal immediately.  \n\nSo no longer 100-200BTC? It's now 200 BTC and 'over' with no cap?!?!?!?!\n\nI think we have the right to know who these parties are that have pushed so aggressively and convincingly on the core developers of the project that within the space of what feels like only 14 days we've gone from discussing the 'possibility' of future crowd sales to voting on what seems like a done deal.\n\nAlso- I think any future crowdsales or large token sales should be opened first and exclusively to the original investors. If you want an extra 200 BTC ask us *first* before diluting our support in the project. Who is to say those who originally invested in the project wouldn't be willing to further fund the project? I certainly would be willing to put more money into the project if it means securing the future of the project. But this talk about selling to some individuals because they just want in cheaper than the market would allow, at a volume that accounts for a significant percentage of the original crowd sale is patently unfair. Your supporters got in at a time when BTC was much more valuable and we purchased significantly fewer tokens then we would have had it been today. Are there any plans to adjust the price per token based on the purchase power of BTC today versus when the crowd sale ran?  Because when BTC goes back up against USD to the level it was at when we originally supporters gave you our BTC, these 1-2 individuals really are going to have cleaned up, aren't they? They will have managed to get in at 3x the purchasing power no? \n\nNot to mention I personally take offense that the vote is worded such that a vote of no further funding is accompanied by what feels like a threat of half a year project delay. I don't see any promise to finish the project 6 months sooner on the option of UNLIMITED additional sales (Option 2). \n\nThis doesn't feel like really involving the community. What about investors who aren't on the forum? This shouldn't be the only voting mechanism anyway (although I take issue with having the vote at all, at this point). Why can't Storj Coin holder be notified with a vote token? Why isn't there something listed on the website where you vote with your exodus address? Who would know this is happening if they just check in on the Storj Website now and then? \n\nGuys, I implore you to think twice about this. I don't doubt you have good and valid intentions, but we all know what the road to hell is paved with. I may be considered to sometimes be an alarmist individual, but I am a reasonable and critical thinking individual and I've been in bitcoin since the almost-start. So many projects have made the mistake you are about to make, so many.... and they paid dearly for it. \n\nIf you MUST raise an additional 200 BTC my (IMHO more FAIR) proposal is: \n\n1. Be specific exactly how many BTC you need to raise. (This 200BTC and uppppppp is not cool)\n\n2. Offer the opportunity to raise funds to the original exodus investors exclusively at the outset. This means, a new crowdsale at original prices, to the original investors of the project. Give us 30 days to consider it and raise the funds. \n\n3. Put this information on the website so people don't need to dig through the forum to figure out whats going on. I checked the website more frequently than the forum until I noticed this crowd-sale talk. You can't expect everyone to be on the forum, read all these comments, and it's not the correct place for a vote. \n\n4. After the crowd sale finishes THEN offer 3rd parties the option to match the difference of the remaining funds that you wish to have. The price should be the prevailing market price or some average of that. Personally I think it should be the average price BEFORE the talk of crowdsales (which naturally spooks the market). \n\nThat would be a MUCH more fair solution and you would STILL raise your funds, but without alienating individuals like myself that feel like the openness and authenticity of the project is being compromised. (Why would you not take VC funds, but you're comfortable with 1-2 people buying 200BTC worth? When both a) btc is 3x lower than the crowdsale b) 200BTC is nearly 1/4 the entire original crowdsale? that's just stinky....)\n\nEDIT: Note, for the SWARM project their community voting is done by tokens- they distributed vote tokens based on the original investment of users, and then the users send their tokens to various addresses corresponding to their vote decisions. This way the original investors are the ones who are voting, not just anyone who signed up on the forum! This would be far more fair as we original investors are the ones most financially affected by this decision! \n\nAlso, this information needs to be on the website! This is a critical decision and it's not listed on the website nor blog! Would an original investor that doesn't browse the forum often be wrong in feeling this information was hidden from them? Does it not feel like Hitch hikers guide to the galaxy when the information regarding the destruction of earth was openly posted on the galactic announcement bulletin board? \n\nEDIT2: If these 1-2 unnamed investors STILL want to buy 200BTC worth of Token regardless- give them the option to first MATCH the original exodus investors, with the exodus investors having a price advantage. So lets us original exodus investors have the option to first buy from you, and then these 1-2 unnamed persons can then match our additional funding at some adjusted price point. If there are really some large individuals out there willing to invest in the project so much, that's great (I would prefer true VC capital but that's besides the point) but these individuals should be entering on a basis that is fair to the original investors and balances the dilution. They can still come on board the project, but the original exodus investors need to have the option to be included. \n\nEDIT3: At least if you took Venture Capital the project would get the prestige of having raised funds from institutional investors. Raising money from 1-2 unnamed individuals will add nothing but skepticism about the intentions of the developers. Who are these people anyway? With VC's we at least know who they are?

See my explanation here: https://storjtalk.org/index.php?topic=2266.msg13910#msg13910\n\nPlease keep in mind sjcx is not, never has been nor ever will be equity ownership in any company,  the plan always has been that the total coins will be sold that was the plan announced before, during and after the original crowdsale.  \n\n------\n\nmy response:\n\n------\nSure, that\'s fine. \n\nI take issue with the fact that we\'ve moved what seems incredibly quickly to a vote proposal that seems final on the basis of forum voting alone. \n\nThis vote is a significant change in the economics of the tokens that have already been distributed in the crowd sale, yet it has received virtually no publicity beyond that little link at the top. There is an email signup on the website to get latest updates and information about Storj, and we\'ve gotten updates that only community  members or early "investors" (or whatever it is that we are now considered) normally get. \n\nNo email has been sent to the community about this vote- why not? \n\nNo notice about the vote was put on the reddit page- why not?\n\nNo mention on the website- why not?\n\nNo update on the blog- why not?\n\nThere isn\'t even a public announcement that Storj is actively considering accepting additional funding. Surely if you can get 2 individuals to put up 200BTC, you might be able to get 4 individuals to offer 400BTC, no? \n\nWhat is so special about these 2 people that this process has to be rushed through in what feels like near secrecy? Who are these people who want in so bad? Why do you want their money so badly as opposed to taking real Venture Capital funding? Which would be public, offer numerous business advantages, and great PR?\n\nWhy is it that a forum poll is being used to determine such an important issue? This is the absolutely least transparent way to hold a vote. You guys control the forum, there is no voting paper trail. I\'m not suggesting any malfeasance in the least, but you said you wanted to be open and transparent with the community. Counterparty offers a clear way to offer a vote that is transparent, conclusive and free from sock-puppet accounts and manipulation. SWARM has proven that the counterparty voting system can be used to allow the community to vote in a clear, open and transparent manner. Another user has suggested this already yet it seems to have not been considered. Why not? It\'s a clearly superior system, accurate, accountable and entirely open. Why opt for those opaque close system?\n\nWhy don\'t you let the people who gave you the money in the first place get to vote with the exodus address they sent the money to in the first place? What is this deliberate effort to avoid transparency? \n\nSo whats up Storj? Whats really going on here? If you need money- come to the people who first gave you the money, first. I\'m sure with the way progress is going people would be more than happy to pitch in to keep the project going. And if you can\'t get enough from us, then go about asking for outside cash, but this is not the way to go about it.

The value of our investments is based on the growth and adoption of Storj. Anything that helps us reach that goal more quickly is a benefit to everyone.  There\'s a very good chance that raising 200BTC to accelerate development will raise the value of SJCX. \n\n**Consider the following:**\n\n* Things in today\'s world are priced in USD. The price of BTC has fallen over 20% since the crowdsale.  Selling more SJCX helps account for this decline in purchasing power.\n* Storj has been very clear that there are 500 million SJCX and that Storj would sell additional coins to raise capital.\n* Storj will likely hire employees and raise venture capital. Both of these events will result in more SJCX being sold.\n\nIf you\'re not comfortable with how the Storj team is managing the project, then you should probably sell your SJCX.  At current market prices, you\'d make a nice profit (in BTC).\n\nEdit: changed "marketing" to "market".  Ooops.': 3, "On day one of the sale you could buy 38,500 SJCX for 1BTC.
