You will get great insight on how the markets work.\n\nYou'll always have small fish and big players. Big players will use their power to profit, will try to manipulate as much as possible. If you're small, try to stay out of the big player's frequency. Usually big players manipulate markets shorter term. Try a mid to long term strategy. Don't get overwhelmed by short term price swings. This is a huge topic and these are very general recommendations, but still worth to ponder on. Develop a profitable strategy, then stick to it. Then change it.\nMy own pension strategy: buy bitcoins from 10% of my monthly personal income and do not care about its price. End of strategy. (I am saying this after 3 years of profitable FX daytrading and algo trading).\n\n2) I don't think Bitcoin will end wars. Bitcoin is neutral, and can be used for any good or bad purpose. It depends on us -- how we fit Bitcoin into our lives. Ending wars is more closely related to human discipline and evolution. Until we can't reach equilibrium in our mental and emotional lives, we won't be able to reach an equilibrium of forces in the outside world. Until there's no equilibrium, there will be wars. Tying Bitcoin to world peace is a fluffy and cute concept, but realistically it won't help us humans defeat our inner greed, anger, envy or lazyness.

I think exploring other mechanisms except SHA256 proof of work to secure the network is essential. It\'s obvious to me that Bitcoin must evolve or eventually be replaced, and altcoins are a great place to experiment with that process of evolution. The thing that a lot of people miss is that for most altcoins, if they become a major competitor to Bitcoin, Bitcoin can always copy-paste the code/features that make that altcoin standout.

The Bitcoin Foundation does more work related to this field.\n\nI also have my personal view on this. I think Bitcoin itself  (and at this stage) is, by design, more of an RTGS than any other thing. It's most widely use case is:\n\n1) a final store of value - Bitcoin has intrinsic value, and is not a substitute or IOU for anything, and as such is a perfect reserve currency;\n2) and a payment network related to (1).\n\nThis is how we use it right now. Its properties are of a very well designed RTGS (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_gross_settlement).\n\nImagine TARGET2 or FedWire on steroids, with no central control and a clean, fully transparent free-market reserve currency. It is suitable for gross settlement of funds, between merchants, banks, business partners. It is less suitable in its current state for massive amounts of super fast real-time micro payments (and by micro I mean your beer or restaurant or grocery bill).\n\nI love paying for my daily lunch with bitcoin at Anker Klub in Budapest, but in its current state Bitcoin is absolutely unsuitable for everyone to do that. The only reason I can do this is that the Bitcoin network processes a very low amount of transactions per second.\n\nWe could make this work in a more real-time fashion; raising the block size (with certain things taken into account), implementing inverse lookup bloom tables or whatever else may help.\n\nI am usually in favor of diverse currencies and payment systems. Money has many properties and you cannot have a one size fits all global supercurrency. You need to focus on problems you want to solve, and solving global problems are different from local ones. A global and a local money would be usually mutually exclusive, but complementary in their design. I really like Bernard Lietaer's view on this (http://www.lietaer.com/writings/articles/).\n\nTo sum it up, I think Bitcoin in its current form (and probably the next 5 years) is more suited for a global real-time settlement network. A super secured chain of truth that practically no one can challenge. That's great for settling millions of dollars, quasi-realtime. There's no other tool to do this now.\n\nBut to pay for my beer (or HFT trading of commodities), I see off chain transactions, side chains, Open Transactions and related ideas to be more suited. Then at the end of the day (or even every 10 minutes) - Open Transactions servers (or Ripple / Stellar gateways, or anything else that'll come up) can do a gross settlement between themselves using the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nYou always have to focus on the problem that needs to be solved. Netting lots of small value restaurant bills with trusted customers need entirely different money and payment properties than settling millions of dollars with global trade partners who potentially don't trust eachother.\n\nGreat things will come out of dev teams starting to get really focused on pain points. We need to think and focus: What are we trying to solve? How do we best achieve that?\n\n": 3, "1) I believe it's primarily the aggregation of choices that many individuals make.\n\nOf course, big players have their impact too; as well as not-so-big players who nevertheless understand the market more than most of us.\n\nBecause you never know who may be tricking you, consistency is key. Don't let the day-to-day fluctuations get to you. Decide what you want to do and stick with it - in the long term, the fluctuations and manipulations don't last, but Bitcoin's growth does.\n\n2) I don't know if Bitcoin has the power to end wars.\n\nBut the fact that we quote the value of a bitcoin in USD is a non-issue. It just so happens that currently, USD and similar currencies are very liquid and have a relatively stable purchasing power short-term, so it is convenient to measure the purchasing power of a bitcoin in USD.

To donate to a political candidate using bitcoin, you have to send the bitcoin out of a wallet that is maintained by the PAC, and those candidates then need to either have wallets to receive the bitcoin and store the bitcoin donations, or, they have to then convert Byrne\'s PAC\'s donated bitcoin using a merchant processor, at some stage of the game.\n\nPerhaps political candidates that receive bitcoin donations from bitcoin PAC, perhaps those candidates will buy printer paper and toner from businesses that accept bitcoin, or perhaps every single bitcoin sent to that PAC will be converted to dollars, you won\'t know.\n\n1+1=2\n\nWhy should we bitcoin users centralize bitcoin private keys into the hands of some political entity, (privately owned and operated), especially a bitcoin PAC, that can then donate to any candidate, for any reason they deem appropriate? Why create an MTgoxPAC, to carry forward the political agenda of a select group of people operating in concert with Washington D.C. insiders, when we can donate to political candidates who accept bitcoin, some who actually mine bitcoin, when we can donate bitcoin directly to the candidates on this list that might be considered the true bitcoin political champions:\n\nhttp://www.followthecoin.com/bitcoin-candidates-campaign-donations-roundup/\n\nWhat will make Byrne and Perianne\'s political decisions using your bitcoin through a PAC and lobbyists in Washington, (sipping champagne and eating filet mignon with the incumbent politicians and lobbyists) ... what will make their political decisions more valid than yours when you might instead make those decisions yourself, using your bitcoin to donate directly to a political candidate who is the real risk taker, a candidate taking bitcoin as a donation and supporting bitcoin overtly?\n\nHere are all of the political candidates taking bitcoin donations at this time, only one of which Perianne has given any meaningful support, (and then has given a lot of support, more than any other), Andrew Hemingway, but Andrew could not even win the primary in his race and get on the ballot, so we can see that Perianne\'s political acumen and ability to make political choices concerning bitcoin might not be very good to start with, and why should she learn with our bitcoin?\n\nI encourage you to study this list of bitcoin candidates: http://www.followthecoin.com/bitcoin-candidates-campaign-donations-roundup/\n\nAnd in the next election cycle in 2016, the US presidential election cycle, continue to make your own political decisions using your bitcoin private keys.': 1, "Still not taken?
